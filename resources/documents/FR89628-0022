Introduction </ITAG>On August 7, 1980, EPA extensively revised its regulations concerning thepreconstruction review of new and modified stationary sources ``new sourcereview'' (NSR)) under the Act, 42 U.S.C. 7401-7642, in response to <T3>Alabama Power Company </T3>v. <T3>Costle, </T3>636 F.2d 323 (D.C. Cir. 1979) (see 45 FR 52676). Fivesets of regulations resulted from those revisions. The first set, 40 CFR51.166 (formerly 40 CFR 51.24), specifies the minimum requirements thata prevention of significant deterioration (PSD) air quality permit programunder Part C of the Act must contain in order to warrant approval by EPAas a revision to a State implementation plan (SIP). The second set, 40CFR 52.21, delineates the Federal PSD permit program, which currently applies,as part of the SIP, in the roughly 20 States that have not submitted aPSD program meeting the requirements of 40 CFR 51.166. The third set, 40CFR 51.165(a) and (b) (formerly 40 CFR 51.18 (j) and (k)), specifies theelements of an approvable State permit program for preconstruction reviewfor nonattainment purposes under Part D of the Act. It elaborates on section173 of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 7503. The fourth set, 40 CFR Part 51, AppendixS, embodies the ``Emissions Offset Interpretative Ruling'' (Offset Ruling),which EPA revised previously in January 1979 (44 FR 3274). The fifth set,40 CFR 52.24, embodies the construction moratorium which EPA implementsin certain nonattainment areas. In the fall of 1980, numerous organizations petitioned the U.S. Court ofAppeals for the D.C. Circuit to review various provisions of those PSDand nonattainment preconstruction regulations. Subsequently, the courtconsolidated those petitions into <T3>CMA, </T3>a collection of challenges to the 1979 revisions to the OffsetRuling. In June 1981, EPA began negotiations with the industry petitionersto settle the <T3>CMA </T3>case. The EPA entered into a comprehensive settlement agreementwith those petitioners in February 1982. Subsequently, the court granteda stay of the case pending implementation of the agreement. In the settlement agreement, EPA committed to propose certain amendments(set forth as Exhibit A of the agreement) to eight portions of the NSRregulations and to provide guidance in three additional areas, and to takefinal action on those proposals. Accordingly, EPA published a notice ofproposed rulemaking in the August 25, 1983 <T4>Federal Register </T4>(48 FR 38742). The EPA noted that it would reviewthe comments carefully and with an open mind and that it would take a newlook at the proposals in order to make an independent judgment on the merits.The EPA received extensive public comment regarding the August 25, 1983document, including that presented at a public hearing. In light of thepublic comments and on the basis of further evaluation, EPA has determinedthat it is appropriate to retain various portions of the regulations thathad been proposed for deletion or revision, while making final certainother portions of the proposed changes. The EPA addressed fugitive emissions in a separate <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice that was published on October 26, 1984(49 FR 43202). This document constitutes final action on six of the remainingseven issues in the August 25, 1983 proposal. With respect to the other remaining issue, Federal enforceability, EPAis today announcing, in a separate <T4>Federal Register </T4>item published in conjunction with this one,its decision to retain the Federal enforceability requirement. Accordingly, today's final actions fulfill EPA's commitments under ExhibitA of the <T3>CMA </T3>settlement agreement. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Final Action on Proposal </ITAG>A. Definition of ``Significant'' <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Background </ITAG>In revising the NSR regulations on August 7, 1980, EPA introduced provisionswhich use the term ``significant.'' One of those provisions defines a ``majormodification'' subject to the PSD requirements as any change at a majorstationary source that would result in a ``significant net emissions increase''in any one of certain pollutants (e.g., andSection; 52.21(b)(2)(i) (45 FR52735)). The other provisions require an applicant for a PSD permit tomeet certain requirements for control technology and air quality impactassessment for each pollutant regulated under the Act that the proposedproject would emit in a ``significant'' amount (e.g., andSection; 52.21(j)(45 FR 52740)). In revising the PSD regulations, EPA also introduced a definition of ``significant''(e.g., andSection; 52.21(b)(23) (45 FR 52739)). The first paragraph of thatprovision defines ``significant'' in terms of rates of emissions. For example,a rate of 40 tons per year (tpy) or more is ``significant'' for sulfurdioxide (SO<T2>2</T2>). Another paragraph of the definition, however, also defines``significant'' in terms of ambient air impacts in Class I areas: <ITAG tagnum="21">Notwithstanding (the first paragraph), significant one means any emissionsrate or any net emissions increase associated with a major stationary sourceor major modification which would construct within 10 kilometers of a ClassI area, and have an impact on such an area equal to or greater than 1 microgramper cubic meter (andCx.18;g/m \3\), (24-hour average). * * *</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">(e.g., Section 52.21(b)(23)(iii) (45 FR 52739)). In the <T3>CMA </T3>case, certain industry petitioners challenged the ambient-basedthreshold for ``significant'' emissions embodied in the paragraph quotedabove. They contend that EPA, in promulgating it, violated section 165(e)(3)(A)of the Act, which prohibits EPA from requiring ``the use of any automaticor uniform buffer zone or zones'' respecting the assessment an applicantmust perform of existing air quality within the impact area of it proposedproject (42 U.S.C. 7475(e)(3)(A)_see Brief for Industry Petitioners onFugitive Emissions (February 11, 1981) at 54; American Mining CongressPetition for Reconsideration, at 35-36).In the August 25, 1983 rulemaking proposal, EPA proposed deletion of theambient-based portion of the definition of ``significant.'' It did so roughlyon the grounds advocated by industry: That the definition constitutes asufficiently low threshold for review as to arguably create a virtuallyuniform buffer zone with respect to air quality analyses (48 FR 38749).  <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Public Comment   </ITAG>a. <T3>Comments Generally Favoring the EPA Proposal.</T3> Various industrycommenters agreed with the basis of the proposal that the 10 kilometerprovision in the existing rules violates the section 165(e)(3)(A) proscriptionof buffer zones. Several industry commenters also stated that the generalsignificance levels provide adequate protection, and that their use wouldbe more workable and appropriate. An industry trade group stated that fieldinstruments cannot detect changes in SO<T2>2</T2> or particulate matter as small as 1 microgram per cubic meter(mg/m\3\) and that a threshold that small would prompt NSR over very broadareas in the west. Another commenter observed that sources subject to NSRwould be required to analyze the impact of smaller sources that had avoidedreview.b. <T3>Comments Generally Opposing the EPA Proposal.</T3> A Federal agencyopposed the proposal since it would remove a requirement for analysis ofpotential adverse impacts on air quality related values in Class I areas,which Congress intended to receive the highest protection. These commentswere supported by environmental groups. The Federal agency stated thatapplicability thresholds keyed to significant emissions rates do not provideadequate protection. First, they are based on tpy, and do not specify amaximum hourly or daily rate. Second, the agency stated it can be easilyshown that sources with total emissions less than the significant ratescan contribute to ambient concentrations greater than 1 mg/m\3\ and, incases of SO<T2>2</T2>, may cause exceedances of the short-term Class I increment.  Third, that commenter noted further that, under the proposal, new sourcegrowth and modifications having emissions of total particulate matter orSO<T2>2</T2> less than the significance levels would neither establish baselinesin affected Class I areas, nor consume PSD increments in areas where baselineshad not been previously established. Conceivably, increases in particulateand sulfur oxides concentrations could reach national ambient air qualitystandards (NAAQS) levels in Class I areas from the cumulative effect ofsuch sources without any review of the contributing sources under the PSDprogram.With regard to industry's buffer zone argument, that commenter stated thatthe 10 kilometer distance in the definition of ``significant'' is reallya technical analysis zone, not a prohibited no-growth buffer zone. Othercommenters agreed that the 10 kilometer criterion was not a proscribedbuffer zone, since it does not prohibit construction of a major sourceor determine in any automatic or uniform manner whether a proposed sourcemay be permitted.   This commenter noted that if the 10 kilometer distance criterion were deleted,the 1 mg/m\3\ impact criterion should be retained for sources at any distancefrom a Class I area, since it will assure establishment of a baseline whensuch impacts occur. Other commenters also urged that the 10 kilometer provisionbe dropped, but the 1 mg/m\3\ threshold be retained, on the grounds thata source's distance from a Class I area is irrelevant to achieving thestated purposes of the Act and protecting air quality in Class I areas.Two State air quality programs agreed that the general tpy significancelevels will not protect a Class I area. One stated that, using EPA's recommendedmodeling criteria, a major source within 2 kilometers of a Class I areawith complex terrain could probably consume the entire Class I 24-hourSO<T2>2</T2> increment by increasing SO<T2>2</T2> emissions 39 tpy. That program added that it is important toremember that 1 mg/m\3\ is a 20 percent consumption of the 24-hour PSDincrement for SO<T2>2</T2>. An environmental group noted that an impact on air qualityrelated values in a Class I area is a function of the amount of the pollutionactually reaching an area rather than amount of pollution emitted froma source, and whether pollutants reach an area is influenced by the modeof emissions (stack versus fugitive) as much as by the amount of pollution.This group stated further that small changes as low as 1 mg/m\3\ in ambientconcentrations can have very significant effects on the acidity of waterand on visibility in an area and that the 1 mg/m\3\ threshold could beeasily reached by a relatively modest shift of ground level fugitive emissionsto stack plumes. In all of this, it is important to remember, the groupconcluded, that the Act's purposes focus on protecting and remedying theactual adverse effects of air pollution in Class I areas.   Finally, another commenter expressed concern that in unusual terrain thesignificance levels would not provide adequate protection for Class I areas,and a private commenter stated that his modeling showed that an existing10 tpy emissions rate from a source within 10 kilometers of a nationalpark exceeded the 1 mg/m\3\ threshold.   <ITAG tagnum="81">3. EPA Analysis   </ITAG>Public comments and reconsideration of the legal issues have persuadedEPA to retain the current definition of ``significant.'' A review of legislativehistory indicates that Congress was concerned only about the potentialfor a ``mandatory no-growth buffer zone'' around Class I areas. The subjectregulation does not violate this congressional directive. Rather, it merelytriggers the requirement to get a PSD permit before constructing, so asto provide for additional protection for Class I areas. The commentinggovernment agency adequately refuted the argument that the current requirementestablishes a ``no-growth'' buffer zone by supplying several examples ofsources which were permitted for locations within 10 kilometers of a ClassI area.The EPA concludes that the subject provision is a useful tool in implementingthe important congressional purpose of protection of Class I areas. Thegeneral significant emissions rates do not assure this and EPA reaffirmsthat, standing alone, they are adequate only for Class II and III areas.It should be noted that the substantive comments favoring deletion of therequirement rely on the questionable premise that the tpy significancenumbers would provide adequate Class I protection. Even one of those comments,from a State air quality program, indicates that this might not be enoughunder some circumstances and recommends a screening procedure based onincrement consumption. Finally, promulgation of the proposal could promptpressure to lower the tpy significance numbers, since those values wouldthen have to protect Class I increments as well as the less stringent ClassII values.   B. <T3>Innovative Control Technology Waiver</T3><ITAG tagnum="81">1. Background   </ITAG>When revising the PSD regulations in August 1980, EPA established, forthe first time, a procedure for granting innovative control technologywaivers of certain PSD requirements (see 45 FR 52735, 52741). The EPA patternedthis procedure after the innovative control technology waiver in section111 of the Act 42 U.S.C. 7411, for new source performance standards (NSPS).The regulations, however, entirely disallow such a waiver if a proposedproject would impact any Class I area (e.g., 40 CFR 52.21(v)(2)(iv)(<T3>b</T3>)).   In the <T3>CMA </T3>case, certain industry petitioners challenged that disallowanceprovision. They contend primarily that the provision is arbitrary becauseit disallows the waiver even if an impact is insignificant or temporary(Fugitive Emissions Brief, at 55).   In the August 1983 rulemaking proposal, EPA preliminarily agreed with industrythat the current formulation of the waiver is overly stringent with respectto Class I areas. Accordingly, EPA proposed to delete the current disallowanceprovision and to insert a new provision authorizing a waiver only if therequirements relating to Class I areas have been satisfied as to all periodsduring the life of the source or modification (48 FR 38750).   <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Public Comment   </ITAG>This part of the proposal attracted relatively little interest, with thosecommenting generally supporting the proposal. One commenter stated thatit would be beneficial to allow this waiver, since it would provide anopportunity to achieve greater emission reductions at the same or lowercost. A State air quality program supported the proposal but would modifyit to ensure that sources receiving waivers would not cause a violationof the air quality increment and would not be eligible for any specialvariance procedures for Class I areas provided by 40 CFR 52.21(p) (4)-(7).A local air pollution control agency opposed the proposal generally, statingthat Congress intended that Class I areas receive maximum protection.     <ITAG tagnum="81">3. EPA Analysis </ITAG>The EPA has decided to promulgate the deletion of this restriction as proposed.The EPA concludes that the limitation on the innovative control technologywaiver is not necessary. As stated in the proposal, any applicant whoseproject would affect a Class I area can nevertheless obtain a PSD permit,if the applicant shows that the project would not cause or contribute toa violation of an increment for the area and the Federal land manager (FLM)fails to show that the project would adversely impact any air quality relatedvalues of the area (e.g., 40 CFR 52.21(p)(3)). In fact, even an applicantwhose project would violate a Class I increment might be able to obtaina permit through special variance procedures under paragraphs (p)(4)-(7)of the regulations. In contrast, an applicant whose project would merelyaffect a Class I area cannot get the innovative control technology waiverunder any circumstances. It is, therefore, inappropriate to deny an innovativecontrol technology waiver to a source merely because it would affect aClass I area. The EPA, in creating the original disallowance, sought to counter-balancean exemption that the waiver provision extends to applicants. Under paragraph(v)(2)(iii), an applicant does not have to show that the proposed projectwould not cause or contribute to an increment violation while operatingunder the waiver (45 FR 52727). As a result, but for the disallowance,a project under a waiver could violate a Class I increment or adverselyaffect an air quality related value. The EPA agrees, however, that thewaiver provision can be refined to exempt an applicant from providing mostof the air quality impact analysis that it would otherwise have to providewith respect to the waiver period and still protect Class I areas fully.To assure adequate protection of Class I areas, EPA is inserting a provisionthat allows the permitting authority to grant a waiver only if the provisionsrelating to Class I areas (i.e., subsection (p)) have been satisfied withrespect to all periods during the life of the source or modification. Thisprovision expands the circumstances in which a waiver is available, butwith additional demonstrations for some applicants. C. Secondary Emissions <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Background </ITAG>The 1978 version of the Part 52 PSD regulations provided in 40 CFR 52.21(1)that, to obtain a permit, an applicant had to show, among other things,that the proposed project would neither cause nor contribute to a violationof a PSD increment or NAAQS (43 FR 26407). The preamble to the regulationsadded that an applicant, in making that showing, generally had to includeany quantifiable ``secondary emissions'' of the proposed project (43 FR26403).\1\<NOTE/> The 1978 Part 51 PSD regulations echoed those requirements:it required any State PSD program to contain a provision equivalent toandSection; 52.21(1). A definition of ``secondary emissions'' did not appearin the Part 51 or Part 52 regulations or in the preambles to them at thattime.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ In view of the restrictions on indirect source reviewin section 110(a)(5) of the Act, EPA added that the applicant could excludeany ``secondary emissions'' from motor vehicles or aircrafts (43 FR 26403n.9). The EPA added vessels to the list so that emissions from vesselsgoing to and from marine terminals are now to be excluded as well (see47 FR 27544 (June 25, 1982)). See also <T3>NRDC </T3>v. <T3>EPA</T3>, 725 F.2d 761 (D.C. Cir. 1984). In revising the PSD regulations in August 1980, EPA retained, in the formof new andSection;andSection; 52.21(k) and 51.24(k) (now andSection; 51.166(k)),the requirement for a demonstration that a proposed project would neithercause nor  contribute to a violation of a PSD increment or NAAQS (45 FR52741, 51784). The EPA, however, added a parenthetical clarification tothose provisions which expressly required the inclusion of ``secondaryemissions.'' It also put a definition of that term into both sets of regulations.Now, ``secondary emissions'' means emissions which would occur as a resultof the construction or operation of a major stationary source or majormodification, but do not come from the major stationary source or majormodification itself. Secondary emissions include emissions from any off-sitesupport facility which would not be constructed or increase its emissionsexcept as a result of the construction or operation of the major stationarysource or major modification. For the purpose of PSD, secondary emissionsmust be specific, well defined, quantifiable, and impact the same generalarea as the stationary source or modification. Secondary emissions do notinclude any emissions from any off-site support facility which would beconstructed or increase its emissions for some reason other than the constructionor operation of the major stationary source or major modification. Secondaryemissions also do not include any emissions which come directly from amobile source, such as emissions from the tailpipe of a motor vehicle orfrom the propulsion unit of a train or a vessel (e.g., 40 CFR 52.21(b)(18)(1981), as amended 47 FR 27554 (June 25, 1982)). An example of an off-site support facility included in the ambient impactdemonstration is a strip mine owned by one company that would be locatednext to a proposed power plant owned by another and that would supply thepower plant. Another example is a quarry owned by one company that wouldbe located next to a proposed cement plant owned by another and that wouldsupply the cement plant. Certain of the industry petitioners in the <T3>CMA </T3>case challenged this requirement on the grounds that EPA exceededits authority in creating it (see Fugitive Emissions Brief, at 48-50; AmericanMining Congress Petition for Reconsideration, at 29-32). They assert thata relevant statutory provision (section 165(a)(3)) requires only that anapplicant include those emissions that would come from the proposed project,since that section refers only to ``emissions from the construction oroperation <T3>of such facility</T3>'' (42 U.S.C. 7475(a)(3) (emphasis added)).\2\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Section 165(a)(3) provides, in relevant part, as follows:<ITAG tagnum="28">(a) No major emitting facility on which construction is commencedafter the date of enactment of this part may be constructed in any areato which this part applies unless * * *. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">*  *  *  *  * </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">(3) * * * the owner or operator of such facility demonstrates * ** that emissions from construction or operation of such facility will notcause, or contribute to, air pollution in excess of * * * (42 U.S.C. 7475(a)).</ITAG>The August 1983 <T4>Federal Register </T4>document proposed deletion of the requirement,but did so on the grounds that secondary emissions are not quantifiableunless the source is already permitted or in operation. The EPA noted thatsection 165(a)(3) also provides that an applicant must show that the proposedproject ``will not cause <T3>or contribute to </T3>air pollution'' in violation of a PSD incrementor NAAQS ((id.) (emphasis added)). This ``contribute'' language persuadedEPA that Congress intended ``secondary emissions'' to be taken into accountfor this limited purpose. Consequently, EPA based the proposed deletionof this requirement upon the premise that secondary emissions are ``arguablynot reasonably quantifiable'' unless from sources already permitted orin operation (48 FR 38750-51). <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Public Comment </ITAG>a. <T3>Comments Generally Favoring the Proposal.</T3> Commenters in supportof the proposal generally claimed that permit applicants have little controlover secondary emissions and that their quantification is complex and burdensome.As a result, such emissions should be reviewed and controlled directly.One commenter observed that secondary emissions review is superfluous inthose cases in which the secondary emitter is major, since that sourcewould be subject to PSD review in any case. Some of these commenters suggested legal interpretations of section 165.Several noted that section 165(a)(3) requires that the applicant demonstrate``that emissions from construction or operation'' of the facility willnot endanger ambient values. Consequently, emissions from support facilitiescannot be included in secondary emissions review since the word ``from''implies a direct connection. An industry trade group contended that section165(a)(6), which requires ``an analysis of any air quality impacts projectedfor the area as a result of growth associated with the facility,'' doesnot preclude the proposed regulatory deletion since it does not equatesuch analyses with ambient standards or increment assessments. Mining industry commenters asserted that EPA has no authority to regulatefugitive dust from coal strip mining operations unless EPA complies withthe rulemaking requirements of section 302(j). This section provides thatfugitive emissions may be included in determining whether a proposed newsource is ``major'' and subject to review only ``as determined by ruleby the Administrator.'' (See Alabama Power Co. v. Costle, 636 F.2d 323,369 (D.C. Cir. 1979)). These commenters were particularly concerned withthe inclusion of fugitive dust emissions from strip mines in the ambientair quality analyses of co-located, coal-fired electric generating facilities.b. <T3>Comments Generally Opposing the Proposal.</T3> The provisions of section165(a) (3) and (6) were also interpreted by commenters opposing the proposal.They stated that the industry interpretation of section 165(a)(3) is toonarrow since, in using the words ``contribute to,'' Congress indicatedthat the sum of the emissions of the proposed source and other projectsaffected by it be taken into account in the ambient demonstration. Theyconcluded that it was reasonable for EPA to have determined in the existingregulations that secondary emissions, which would not be produced ``butfor'' the new facility, should be included as part of the emissions fromthe facility's construction or operation. Commenters also pointed out thatsection 165(a)(6) requires an analysis of associated growth and that thiscannot be complied with unless secondary emissions are considered. An environmentalgroup cited section 165(a)(6) and concluded that it would be anomalousto suggest that the air quality analysis must be performed, but that afinding that secondary emissions would violate increments or standardsmust be ignored in the permitting decision. Several commenters challenged the proposal's conclusion that secondaryemissions are not quantifiable. A Federal agency noted that secondary emissionshave been quantified in numerous environmental impact statements. Theyadded that there is no major difference between quantifying emissions froma source that does not have a permit and one that does, since many operatingparameters are known before a source is constructed and, conversely, manypermits are issued on the basis of preliminary design information. A Stateair quality program reported that it disagrees with the contention thatsecondary emissions are significantly more difficult to measure. Commenters also noted that secondary emissions can be important. One commenterreported that, as the result of a proposed oil shale processing facility,an entire town was planned with all the quantifiable emissions sourcesassociated with major urban areas, such as space heaters and incinerators.Another commenter stated that EPA should not exempt all sources from assessingsecondary emissions simply because of a few cases in which such emissionsare not reasonably quantifiable. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. EPA Analysis </ITAG>After review of the public comments and further analysis of the subjectprovision, EPA has decided to retain the current regulation. Evaluationof secondary emissions is consistent with section 165 of the Act. Section165(a)(6), in particular, indicates strong congressional concern that secondaryemissions be reviewed as part of the applicant's ambient impact assessment.The regulation also furthers the broader purposes of an NSR program thatemphasizes prospective review of all the consequences of growth so as tominimize the risk of future ambient air quality problems. The EPA acknowledgesthat there may be situations in which quantification of secondary emissionsmay be unduly speculative or complex. The ``reasonably quantifiable'' conditionin this requirement provides an appropriate response to those problems.The EPA disagrees with the comments of mining industry representativesthat it must conduct a separate rulemaking under section 302(j) beforeit can consider secondary emissions from strip mines or any other industrialcategory. Section 302(j) only addresses whether fugitive emissions shouldbe included in threshold applicability determinations. Once a source isfound to be major, section 302(j) is irrelevant to the application of substantiveNSR requirements. Thus, in Alabama Power, the D.C. Circuit upheld EPA'sposition that section 302(j) has no bearing whatsoever on the applicabilityof substantive PSD requirements under section 165 after a source is determinedto be major. 636 F.2d at 369 (``[t]he terms of section 165 * * * applywith equal force to fugitive emissions and emissions from industrial pointsources''). D. Offset Credit for Source Shutdowns and Curtailments <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Background </ITAG>The concept of ``offsetting'' is the core of nonattainment NSR permitting.An applicant (for a permit for a ``major'' project that would be locatedin an area that is nonattainment for a pollutant for which the projectis major) must show that the emissions of the pollutant from the projectwill be offset by sufficient creditable reductions in emissions elsewhereso as to assure reasonable further progress (RFP) toward attainment anda net air quality benefit (see section 173(1) of the Act; 40 CFR 51.165(a)(2)(formerly 40 CFR 51.18(j)(2)), 40 CFR Part 51, Appendix S (known as the``Offset Ruling''), Section IV.A).\3\<NOTE/> The relevant regulations (40 CFR 51.165(a) (formerly 40 CFR51.18(j)) and the Offset Ruling contain detailed criteria for determiningthe creditability of emissions reductions that come from the permanentshutdown or curtailment of a source. They allow a reduction from a shutdownor curtailment that occurred before the date of the preconstruction permitapplication to be creditable only if: (1) The  curtailment occurred afterAugust 7, 1977, and (2) the proposed source is a replacement for the productivecapacity represented by the proposed offset credit \4\<NOTE/> (40 CFR 51.165(a)(3)(ii)(c) (formerly 51.18(j)(3)(ii)(c))and 40 CFR Part 51, Appendix S, Section IV.C.3 footnote 9).\5\<NOTE/> The stated purpose of this restriction was ``to ensure thatan offset relates to the current air quality problem * * *'' (see 44 FR3280).\6\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ The Offset Ruling currently applies in only a few circumstances.In general, the construction moratorium, or preconstruction review programsapproved as meeting the requirements of section 173, as set forth in 40CFR 51.165(a), have supplanted it.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ This provision first appeared in the original Offset Ruling,41 FR 55529 (December 21, 1976). The EPA repromulgated it, with some refinement,when it revised the Offset Ruling in January 1979 (44 FR 3284). It wasincluded in 40 CFR 51.18(j) (now 40 CFR 51.165(a)) (see 45 FR 52672, August7, 1980). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ The regulations also provide that a reduction from a shutdownor curtailment that occurs after the date of application is creditableonly if: (1) the work force has been notified of the shutdown or curtailment,and (2) the shutdown or curtailment is federally enforceable (40 CFR 51.165(a)(3)(ii)(c) and (e); Appendix 5. Section IV.C.3). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ In September 1980, EPA declined to revise the restrictionin the Offset Ruling in response to comments opposing it (see 45 FR 59876-77).In the <T3>CMA</T3> case, certain industry petitioners challenged the restrictionin 40 CFR 51.18(j) (now 40 CFR 61.165(a)) and the Offset Ruling, claimingthat EPA violated the intent of Congress and acted arbitrarily and capriciously(see Brief for Industry Petitioners on Source Shutdown and Curtailment,February 12, 1981). The August 25, 1983 <T4>Federal Register </T4>document proposed deletion of the restriction.The EPA's action was based on its preliminary agreement with the <T3>CMA</T3> case petitioners that section 173 of the Act does not allowa restriction on the creditability of offsets. The proposal also agreedpreliminarily that the restriction is unnecessary and, therefore, undesirable.The EPA also proposed to change the cutoff dates in the provisions fromAugust 7, 1977 to ``a reasonable date specified in the plan,'' in the caseof 40 CFR 51.18 (now Subpart I) and to the date of original promulgationof the Offset Ruling (December 21, 1976). Finally, EPA proposed to deletethe restriction that relates to notification of the work force (48 FR 38751-52).<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Comments Supporting the Proposal </ITAG>This issue attracted the greatest number of comments, although many werequite similar. Industry in southern California expressed special interestin this topic. Comments received on EPA's separate notice regarding thepossible uses of shutdown credits for bubbles under EPA's Emissions TradingPolicy Statement (ETPS) (48 FR 39580, August 31, 1983) were also takeninto account in the present rulemaking. A great majority of the commenterssupported the proposal in whole or in part. a. <T3>Restriction of Credits to Replacement Facilities. </T3>Several of thecommenters stated that this restriction violates section 173 of the Actand is arbitrary. One industry commenter explained that the existing ruleinfringes on the authority of a State to make growth management decisions,and that a State's internal growth decisions must be approved by EPA undersections 172 and 173 if RFP and attainment are assured. Moreover, thiscommenter claimed that the existing provision is arbitrary, since thereis no rational basis to distinguish emissions reductions achieved by shutdownsand curtailments from emissions reductions achieved by other means. The bulk of the comments stressed the practical need to allow this potentialavenue for offset credits. Many of these commenters noted that industriesin nonattainment areas find it difficult to obtain emissions reductioncredits to use as offsets, since sources in those areas are already subjectto rigorous pollution control requirements. In particular, they claimedthat allowing credit for past shutdowns and curtailments is  the only hopefor continued growth and the replacement of older, more polluting facilitieswith newer, better controlled facilities in southern California. A localair pollution authority supported this contention by stating that it alreadyrequires the highest level of reasonably available control technology (RACT),and there is no reasonable opportunity for proposed sources to get creditfrom improved control by existing sources. Practically, therefore, allcredits banked in the district are the result of shutdowns or curtailments.Thus, unless EPA's proposal is adopted, emission ``banks'' could be withoutassets available for new source offsets, which would adversely affect eventhe best controlled growth, employment, and the value of the emissionsreduction credits already filed by over 100 companies. Several projectswere described that would be adversely affected by retention of the restrictionon offset credits. Some of the supporting commenters argued that since air pollution agenciesmust require a greater than one-to-one ratio in crediting past reductionsto proposed increases in emissions, trading (including credit for priorshutdowns and curtailments) should be encouraged since every time thereis a trade, a net air quality benefit results. In this view, the abilityto trade serves the Act's air quality purposes, since it provides an incentivefor industries to look for ways to reduce emissions and, in particular,to replace old polluting facilities with newer and cleaner ones. One commenter opposed discounting of offsets from prior source shutdownsbut stated that, if EPA feels it necessary to require special discountingof such credits to achieve ambient standards in severe nonattainment areas,then the definition of ``shutdown'' should refer to only an ``entire plant,''rather than to specific equipment, thus allowing sources some flexibilityand consequent economic benefit. One air pollution control agency addressed the issue of credit from priorshutdowns or curtailments in nonattainment areas without a demonstrationof attainment and stated that EPA should allow such credits but set certainadditional conditions on their use. These conditions should be, it continued,that such emissions reductions: (1) Not be double-counted, (2) be discountedat a greater than one-to-one ratio, and (3) not be used to ``net out''of best available control technology. The EPA was also urged to define``shutdown'' as removal from service of an individual piece of equipment,a process line, or an entire plant. This commenter stated further thatEPA should not include replacement of an individual piece of equipment,or relocation of equipment without modification to a nearby noncontiguousproperty, in the definition of ``shutdown.'' This commenter stated EPAshould also not consider the motive for the shutdown, which is subjectiveand would be difficult to discern. Another air pollution control agency also supported the proposal, but wasconcerned over potential double counting. To prevent abuses, this commenteradvised that a person creating an emissions reduction credit from a shutdownof equipment later be required to offset emissions increases, at leastequal to the amount of the emissions credit, from similar types of newor modified major or nonmajor equipment. b. <T3>Time Limitations. </T3>Arguing that the use of shutdown credits promotesRFP toward attainment of the Act's goals by securing more reductions thanincreases and by facilitating the replacement of old, dirty facilitieswith new, clean ones, and given the great need for offsets by companiesin nonattainment areas who seek to modernize or expand, several commentersstated that there should be no time limitations on the use of credits,as long as the State  is not explicitly taking credit for the shutdownin its applicable air quality plan. Some of these commenters stated that,at a minimum, all credits for shutdowns and curtailments occurring afterDecember 21, 1976 should be allowed. Two other commenters stated they had no objection to the ``reasonable date''time limitation in 40 CFR 51.18(j) (now 40 CFR 51.165(a)), or to the proposedDecember 21, 1976 date for offsets, since both those proposals are consistentwith the <T3>CMA </T3>settlement agreement. Both commenters stated, however, thatthey favor the removal of any time limitation in order to provide flexibility,so long as a State did not take that shutdown or curtailment credit intoaccount when formulating its attainment plan. Other commenters supportedthe December 21, 1976 cutoff date. Commenters from local air pollution control agencies also suggested alternativecutoff dates, generally based on the year a State established an emissionsinventory for purposes of preparing its plan for attainment. For example,one local authority stated that the proper baseline date for creditingan offset is that of the SIP base year inventory. A group of local agenciesrecommended: (1) That EPA specify an appropriate baseline date from whichState and local agencies can compute shutdown credits on grounds that anycredits from plant closings should not be open-ended, and (2) that anybenefits from the shutdowns should compensate directly those citizens inthe community where the shutdown occurred. Another local control groupsuggested that the cutoff date should be related to the date of adoptionof the local NSR rule.Another commenter, in noting that the December 21, 1976 cutoff date maybe reasonable, observed that there may well be a ``natural'' limit to thedate which can be established, since even process and fuel use recordsbecome difficult to find as one goes back in time. The best approach, thecommenter stated, is for the States to determine what date is ``reasonable''based on inventory information, enabling legislation, or other criteria,and then use this date for both 40 CFR 51.18(j) (now 40 CFR 51.165(a))and the Offset Ruling.State agencies asserted that a baseline date should be established to limitshutdown credits, but differed as to the amount of State discretion thatcould be used in setting such baseline dates. One State control agencyagreed that EPA should allow the States to set a ``reasonable'' date forboth the 40 CFR 51.18(j) and Offset Ruling credit determinations. Thisagency and an agency from another State specifically recommended that thecutoff date be a moving date, not earlier than 5 years before the applicationdate. They noted that permitting authorities do not have unlimited timeto delve into past records, if such records exist at all. A different Statecontrol agency maintained that the cutoff date should be concurrent withthe date of emissions inventory, which would preclude a windfall for sourcesthat shut down after an arbitrary date like August 7, 1977. In no event,however, should the cutoff date be before August 7, 1977, the State concluded.Another State group noted that the requirements in sections 129 and 172of the Act (that offsets provide a net air quality benefit and not interferewith RFP toward attainment) would preclude the use of emissions reductionsfor shutdowns before the date of the baseline inventory on which the nonattainmentplan is based. Finally, one commenter claimed that businesses in nonattainment areas areoften advised by legal counsel to delay installation of control equipment,implementation of cleaner production methods, or removal of older equipmentin order to preserve credit for the company's own expansion or sale ofthe credits to other businesses. This, the commenter stated, is becausethe existing EPA rule denies offsets for any reduction in air pollutiondue to a shutdown or curtailment occurring before credit is applied forregarding new construction.c. <T3>Notification of the Work Force. </T3>The several commenters who addressedEPA's proposed deletion of the rule regarding notification of the workforce supported it on the grounds that EPA lacks statutory authority forthis requirement.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Comment Opposing the Proposal</ITAG>The primary comment in opposition to the proposal came from a coalitionof several environmental groups. Their analysis is based on a fundamentaldistinction between emissions reductions achieved through shutdowns andcurtailments and those achieved by actually installing pollution controls.They observed that sources have a limited life and a natural cycle of operationwithin that span, with the older units often being used for a relativelysmall portion of the time. Since a company's plans regarding capacity utilizationand ultimate retirement of the unit are generally not public, a SIP, ofnecessity, exaggerates the emissions and longevity of many sources in itsemissions inventory. This means that source owners may be able to get inappropriatelylarge ``paper'' credits that would lead to actual worsening of air qualitywhen used to offset emissions from new sources that would be operatingat a higher capacity utilization. These commenters also asserted that therequirement, in section 172 of the Act, that attainment of the standardsbe achieved ``as expeditiously as practicable,'' disallows crediting ofany noncontemporaneous shutdowns. They contended that emissions reductionsdue to such noncontemporaneous shutdowns are ``environmental windfalls''and, as the current regulations provide, should not be creditable for offsettingpurposes. Similarly, they opposed the proposed change in cutoff dates forthese credits as a further expansion of windfall credits.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. EPA Analysis</ITAG>After careful consideration of the comments received and further analysisof the issues involved, EPA has decided to promulgate the proposed eliminationof the restriction on the use of prior shutdown credits for offset purposesonly where the SIP contains an approved attainment demonstration. The EPAis retaining the current restrictions on crediting, for offset purposes,emissions reductions attributable to the prior shutdown or curtailmentof an existing source in those nonattainment areas for which there is notan approved demonstration of attainment of the NAAQS. In addition, EPAis adding certain safeguards to assure that prior shutdown credits, wherethey are allowed, are consistent with the area's SIP.The EPA believes that this decision to relax the current regulations comportswith congressional intent regarding the offset program. However, as a preliminarymatter, it is appropriate to point out that the Act does not expresslymandate any particular treatment of shutdowns for offset crediting purposes.Rather, this question is a matter within the administrative discretiondelegated to EPA under the Act. In <T3>Chevron, U.S.A. Inc. </T3>v. <T3>NRDC, Inc.</T3>, 467 U.S. 837 (1984), the Supreme Court reaffirmedthat Congress intended to grant EPA broad discretionary authority in implementingthe 1977 Amendments to the Act. This discretion extends to rules implementingthe nonattainment plan provisions in Part D generally and, in particular,the offset program in section 173. (Indeed, Congress made an explicit delegationby incorporating the Offset Ruling, and authorizing EPA to amend it, inan uncodified provision of the 1977 Amendments o the Act (section 129 ofPub. L. 95-95), 42 U.S.C. 7502 Note.) Thus, although it is true, as notedin the proposed regulations, that section 173 requires EPA to allow theconstruction of new sources in nonattainment areas where such constructionwill be consistent with RFP toward attainment, EPA retains broad discretionto establish criteria for determining when RFP has been assured. In thisregard, EPA believes that it is certainly a reasonable exercise of itsdiscretion to distinguish between the showing necessary to represent RFPwhere there is an attainment demonstration and the showing needed wherean attainment demonstration is lacking. In the latter situation, EPA canproperly require greater assurances that offset transactions will resultin the improvement of air quality. The final rules reflect this position.The essence of the Act's offset provision is that a new source may be allowedin a nonattainment area only where its presence would be consistent withRFP toward attainment of the NAAQS. The EPA's primary concern in this regardis that State plans provide reliable assurance of steady improvement inair quality and attainment by the target dates. Thus, where a fully approvedSIP demonstrates RFP and attainment, it is appropriate to grant that Statemaximum flexibility in its nonattainment plan, under section 173, withinthe constraint that the demonstration not be invalidated. By definition,any fully approved SIP has independently assured RFP and attainment. Therefore,allowing credit for the prior shutdown of sources which the SIP assumedare currently in operation generally is appropriate in this context, becauseit will not endanger the overall showing of RFP and attainment. Of course,this independent assurance would be lacking to the extent that the SIPhas relied on such prior shutdowns in its attainment demonstration, orto the extent that the emissions reductions attributable to the prior shutdownscannot reasonably be ascertained.Following these principles, EPA has concluded that, so long as adequatesafeguards are in place to prevent possible abuses (e.g., provisions toavoid double counting and ensure proper quantification of credits), itis no longer necessary to restrict shutdown credits under a fully approvedSIP in the manner currently provided by 40 CFR 51.165(a)(3)(ii)(c) andthe Offset Ruling (40 CFR Part 51, Appendix S, section IV.A). In contrast,where a SIP, at this late date, lacks an approved attainment demonstration,EPA has a responsibility under sections 110(a)(2)(I), 172(a)(1), and 173(1)(A)to disallow offset transactions that do not clearly demonstrate RFP towardtimely attainment. The EPA has concluded that, where an attainment demonstrationis lacking, retention of the current shutdown credit restriction on offsettransactions is necessary both to assure RFP and to guarantee that a newsource does not cause or contribute to a violation of the NAAQS.At the outset, EPA should point out that the nonattainment areas requiringbut lacking attainment demonstrations, which are at the center of EPA'scurrent concern regarding the shutdown credit issue, were not specificallyaddressed in the proposed rule. The August 1983 proposal assumed that,in general, nonattainment areas would either be governed by a preconstructionreview program approved as meeting the requirements of section 173 (i.e.,where there was an approved demonstration of attainment), or be subjectto a construction moratorium under section 110(a)(2)(I) (i.e., where therewas no such demonstration) (see 48 FR 38742, 38751 and n. 23). In fact,there are currently several categories of SIP's, listed below, which haveneither fully demonstrated attainment nor are currently subject to a constructionmoratorium. It is these areas which, for the reasons detailed below, mustremain subject to the shutdown credit restriction.As noted previously, the essence of the offset program is to ensure thatadditional emissions from a new source will be offset by correspondingreductions elsewhere so as to result in RFP toward attainment. Althoughneither the Act itself nor the legislative history is explicit regardingthe source of these offsetting emissions reductions, it seems clear thatCongress contemplated a relatively well-defined transactional relationshipbetween the existing offsetting source(s) and the new source. Thus, theSenate Report on the 1977 Amendments emphasized that the offset programwas meant to entail a case-by-case review, in which a new source wouldobtain ``matching reductions from existing sources'' (S. Rep. No. 127,95th Cong., 1st. Sess. 55, reprinted in ``3 Legislative History of theClean Air Act Amendments of 1977,'' at 1429). Certainly, this transactionalapproach has been followed since EPA's original 1976 Offset Ruling, whichCongress did not alter in pertinent part when it enacted Part D. At oneextreme under the current rules, the new source may actively and directlyinduce specific emissions reductions, such as by causing an existing sourceto install control equipment not otherwise required under the Act, or byreplacing its own existing facilities with newer, cleaner facilities. Asomewhat more attenuated market relationship is present when an existingsource voluntarily installs pollution controls to reduce emissions belowlegally required levels and places the surplus in a ``bank'' from whichthat surplus is later purchased by a prospective new source needing offsets.Toward the other extreme, there is a temporal relationship between a newsource which applies for a construction permit on a certain date, and unrelatedexisting sources which shut down or curtail operations after that date.The 1977 Amendments sought to reconcile the need for economic growth innonattainment areas and the environmental interest in improving air qualityin those same areas by granting States greater flexibility in accommodatingthese often conflicting goals (see H. R. Rep. No. 294, 95th Cong., 1stSess. 211, reprinted in ``4 Legislative History of the Clean Air Act Amendmentsof 1977,'' at 2678). Recognizing this congressional direction, EPA hastaken affirmative steps to encourage early replacement of existing, dirtiersources with newer, cleaner ones without requiring NSR when there wouldbe no significant net increase in emissions as a result of that change.Examples include EPA's decision to allow States to adopt a ``plantwide''definition of ``source'' for purposes of the preconstruction review programin nonattainment areas where it is consistent with RFP and attainment (see46 FR 5076 (1981)). The Supreme Court upheld this approach in <T3>Chevron, U.S.A., Inc.</T3> v.<T3> NRDC, Inc.,</T3> 407 U.S. 837 (1984).As noted above, several industry commenters likewise favored eliminationof the prior shutdown offset credit restriction on grounds that the presentrules discourage early replacement of older, dirtier facilities. The EPAagrees with the general thrust of this proposition_that the offset rulesshould encourage construction of new sources, so long as there is a linkageto the removal from service of older and dirtier sources, and that suchremoval results in progress toward attainment. Indeed, the purpose of thepresent offset rules is to allow offset credit for prior shutdowns in thosecircumstances where EPA has a reasonable assurance that the shutdown issufficiently ``matched'' with the new source, such that use of the offsetcredit can be said to represent RFP. Similarly, for the reasons statedabove, where a SIP contains an adequate demonstration of attainment_andhence an independent assurance of RFP_EPA has determined that a significantlymore attenuated link between a prior shutdown and the construction of anew source may be sufficient to constitute RFP, and thus the prior shutdowncredit restriction may be deleted. However, with respect to those areaswithout the attainment demonstration mandated by section 172(a)(1), andtherefore no independent assurance of RFP, EPA has concluded that it remainsinappropriate, under the present NSR structure, to attribute preapplicationshutdowns to the construction of an unrelated new source for offset purposes.The EPA believes that this is a reasonable basis upon which to distinguishthe creditability of prior shutdowns and offsets generated by other means.The restriction on crediting of prior shutdowns for NSR offset purposesin areas without adequate plans rests on logic similar to the logic reflectedin EPA's Emissions Trading Policy Statement, which governs trades betweenexisting sources (i.e., bubbles) (see generally 51 FR 43814-43860, December4, 1986). In the ETPS, EPA decided to allow, with stringent qualitativesafeguards, the use of shutdown credits for bubbles with case-by-case EPAapproval as a SIP revision, or under generically approved State programsin areas lacking approved attainment demonstrations, so long as the shutdownof a source occurred after its application to bank or trade, special baselineand extra reduction requirements were met, and the State gave assurancesof noninterference with future SIP planning. The EPA concluded that itwas plausible to presume that such a source's decision to shut down waselicited ``at least in part'' by an opportunity to trade or bank emissionsreduction credits (see 51 FR 43822). Thus, in the ETPS, EPA did not pretendthat it had divined an unvarying, dominant economic motive behind all existingsource trades involving shutdowns, but rather that it had resolved a closequestion in a generic fashion as a practical necessity (see 51 FR 43811).Applying a presumption as to transactional relationship under both NSRand the ETPS is a reasonable accommodation, administratively necessaryto avoid extraordinarily difficult, case-by-case determinations of subjectivemotive.However, EPA also believes it is reasonable to continue on somewhat differentpaths to these common goals of NSR and emissions trading given the longstandingdistinctions between the two programs. For example, in emissions trading,EPA presumes that even shutdowns occurring before an application to tradewere elicited by an opportunity to trade if they occurred after an applicationto bank. Any doubts about that presumption are compensated for by otherprogram-wide safeguards. These include the requirements that all tradesunder generic programs in nonattainment areas without adequate plans_notjust those trades involving banking or shutdowns_use a very stringent baseline,produce a net reduction in actual emissions of at least 20 percent, andbe accompanied by State assurances that a trade is consistent with ambientprogress and future air quality planning goals (see 51 FR 43832). For NSRoffset purposes, EPA has presumed that shutdowns banked prior to a newsource application are not transactionally related to the new source, butEPA historically has not required a lower-of-actual-or-allowable baseline,an across-the-board minimum offset ratio, or State assurances for offsettransactions generally.Nothing in the Act requires that emissions trading and NSR programs treatshutdown credits or other credits in precisely the same way. Moreover,revamping the longstanding NSR offsets system to incorporate all of theprovisions of the ETPS would be a time-consuming and burdensome process.Accordingly, issuance of the ETPS does not, as the ETPS itself indicated,force EPA to abandon the longstanding restriction on use of shutdown offsetcredits in areas without adequate plans.\7\<NOTE/> Likewise, the ETPS does not independently require EPA toadopt a uniformly tighter baseline, a minimum 20 percent reduction in emissions,or a State assurance provision in its NSR program as a general matter.The end result is that EPA has rationally chosen different administrativemechanisms which it believes will serve equally well the statutory goalsof RFP and attainment.   <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ In adopting the ETPS, EPA noted that nothing therein alteredexisting NSR requirements or the need for compliance with them (see 51FR 43831).   An additional consideration in this regard is EPA's developing programto address the failure of many metropolitan areas to meet the December31, 1987 attainment date for ozone and carbon monoxide, which is the latestone specified in the Act. On November 24, 1987, EPA published a comprehensiveproposed policy that spells out, in detail, the planning requirements thatEPA expects to impose on areas that still lack adequate plans for attainment,or have otherwise failed to meet the NAAQS (see 52 FR 45044). AlthoughEPA has not yet issued a final policy, in May 1988, the Agency issued noticesthat the SIP's for numerous areas are ``substantially inadequate'' withinthe meaning of section 110(a)(2)(H) of the Act. The notices call for SIPrevisions in those areas, so that States will begin the fundamental activitiesnecessary to make progress toward attainment of the ozone and carbon monoxideNAAQS (see 53 FR 20722, 20724 (June 6, 1988)). Although the final contoursof EPA's post-1987 policy have not been drawn, it is clear that many Stateswill face substantial planning burdens and the need to adopt additionalcontrol measures for the areas in question. Under these circumstances,EPA believes it would be inappropriate even to hold out the possibilitythat States could obtain approval at this time for expanded use of shutdownoffset credits in areas with inadequate plans. In light of the continuedsevere ozone and CO nonattainment in many metropolitan areas beyond the1987 statutory deadline, any such approval would need to be conditionedon the adoption of safeguards at least as stringent as those now requiredfor approval of generic bubble rules under the ETPS.\8\<NOTE/> But it is doubtful that affected States could provide, forexample, the necessary assurances that prior shutdown offset credits wouldbe consistent with ambient progress and future air quality planning goals.In particular, EPA could not approve a general relaxation on the currentrestriction on the use of prior shutdown offsets until, at a minimum, aState has completed a draft emissions inventory, which is required within12 months of the SIP call (see 52 FR 45056). This is so because, if theState lacks an approved attainment plan, the absence of an emissions inventorymeans that EPA has no assurance that use of prior shutdown offset creditsfor an indefinite period of time, without further review by EPA, wouldbe consistent with further SIP planning for attainment. (For the same reason,the State would be unable to determine whether a 20 percent net reductionin emissions or some larger percent reduction would be consistent withthat needed to attain in the area.) \9\<NOTE/>   <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ State generic bubble rules under the ETPS and State offsetrules under NSR are structurally similar because, in both programs, EPAreviews and approves the rules governing the overall conduct of such programsby the States indefinitely into the future but does not pass judgment onindividual transactions which these programs share.   <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ It should be noted that State rules may at the presenttime allow sources to preserve prior shutdown credits for future use atsuch time as an attainment demonstration has been approved by EPA, providedthat the emissions inventory used in the development of the approved attainmentdemonstration explicitly includes as current ``existing'' emissions theemissions from the previously shutdown sources. In addition, the emissionsreductions from such shutdown sources must be permanent, quantifiable,and federally enforceable at the time of use.   The final factor in today's decision is that the possibility that eliminationof the shutdown credit restriction would serve to encourage economic growthand early cleanup is insufficient to justify a radical departure from thepresent NSR offset rules in nonattainment areas lacking adequate attainmentdemonstrations. In contrast to situations where a new source is responsiblefor the installation of additional control equipment by an existing source,or where an existing source replaces an old item of process equipment witha newer one, the relationship between the prior shutdown of an existingsource and the later construction of an unrelated new source is not obvious.In an August 31, 1983, <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice, EPA solicited comments on the issue ofwhether the restriction on shutdown crediting induced sources to keep older,dirtier facilities on line beyond their economically optimum period ofuse in order to preserve potential emissions reduction credits (48 FR 39585).No definitive evidence that such is the case was received. In the absenceof such evidence, EPA is not compelled to adopt this change in areas lackingadequate attainment demonstrations.   Accordingly, at this time EPA is retaining the offset restrictions on shutdownswhich occurred prior to the date of the construction permit applicationwhere there is no adequate attainment demonstration. The EPA believes itis reasonable to deem that postapplication shutdowns may be transactionallylinked to the new source for purposes of demonstrating RFP under the NSRoffset requirement. Conversely, a preapplication shutdown (other than areplacement) can reasonably be viewed as insufficiently related to thenew source, and therefore unavailable for purposes of demonstrating thatthe net result of construction of the new source is RFP, in those nonattainmentareas lacking an adequate independent demonstration of RFP and timely attainment.     The EPA believes that this position comports with congressional intentregarding the proper role of the offset program. Moreover, EPA believesthat this position is generally consistent with requirements for bubbles under the ETPS, taking into account the different history and functionsof these programs. It is also consistent with EPA's emerging post-1987nonattainment policy. Finally, EPA's position follows the recommendationof many pollution control agencies by avoiding the difficult and intrusivetask of determining a source's subjective motive for shutting down or curtailingproduction. The EPA wishes to clarify the four types of planning circumstances in whichEPA considers the SIP to be inadequate and will continue to restrict offsetcredits for prior shutdowns. In all but the following situations, EPA willconsider the SIP to contain an acceptable attainment demonstration andwill allow the general offsetting use of prior source shutdowns, providedall other criteria regarding creditable emissions reductions are met: a. The total suspended particulates (TSP) areas that are designated nonattainmentunder section 107 in States which failed to submit a 1979 Part D attainmentdemonstration or submitted one that did not receive full EPA approval.This also includes both primary and secondary TSP nonattainment areas thatsubmitted a SIP that did not include an actual demonstration of attainmentbut still received EPA approval (e.g., a ``RACT plus studies'' SIP). AlthoughEPA has changed the NAAQS indicator for particulate matter from TSP toparticulate matter nominally 10 microns and less (PM<T2>10</T2>), the TSP nonattainment designations will remain in place atleast until a State receives EPA approval of its PM<T2>10</T2> attainment plan. Until such time, State NSR provisions requiringcompliance with the old TSP requirements_including offsets_remain in effect(see 52 FR 24672, 24682, and 24684). b. Nonattainment areas that have received a final notice of  disapprovalof their current SIP. c. Nonattainment areas that have received either a section 110(a)(2)(H)notice of deficiency based on failure to attain or maintain the primaryNAAQS, or a notice of failure to implement an approved SIP. This includesnewly designated primary nonattainment areas that do not yet have an EPA-approvedattainment demonstration to address the new-found nonattainment problem.d. Nonattainment areas that received notice from EPA that they have failedto meet conditions in their EPA-approved SIP's, including commitments toadopt particular regulations by specified dates. There may be circumstances where, subsequent to the submittal of a completepermit application which relies on a specific prior shutdown or curtailmentwhich is otherwise creditable, the SIP's attainment demonstration is nolonger considered adequate for one of the four reasons outlined above.In such cases, the criteria for crediting prior source shutdowns in areaswith an acceptable demonstration will continue to apply to the processingof the permit. Regarding the comments pertaining to the proper definition of shutdownfor offsetting purposes, EPA wishes to clarify that where the prior shutdownrestrictions remain in place, ``source shutdown'' refers to the permanentwithdrawal from productive capacity of any building, structure, facility,installation, item of process equipment, or combination thereof. This nontechnicaldefinition of the potential sources of offset credits has been followedby EPA since adoption of the original Offset Ruling, and clearly comportswith the purpose of the offset program. The EPA did not intend to alterits policy in October 1981 (see 46 FR 50766), when EPA adopted a ``plantwide''definition of ``source'' for determining the overall applicability of theNSR requirements.  With respect to the question of discounting of shutdown offsets, EPA'sposition is that where offset credit for shutdowns is appropriate, suchcredits may be treated in the same fashion as any other type of emissionsreduction. Thus, shutdown offset credits continue to be subject to anygeneral offset ratio specified in an applicable SIP unless the State inits discretion establishes a different ratio for such credits, and arenot subject to the special baseline, across-the-board 20 percent net emissionsreduction, or State assurance requirements applicable to ``progress'' bubblesunder EPA's ETPS. Regarding time limitations, the EPA agrees with the reasoning of thosecommenters who favored removal of inflexible nationwide time limitationson the crediting of prior shutdowns. However, EPA does not concur thattime limitations are wholly unnecessary, so long as a State has not explicitlytaken credit for the shutdown in its SIP. Rather, some limitations mustbe retained to provide adequate assurance for air quality planning andadministrative reasons that shutdown credits are allowed only where theywill, in fact, result in RFP. As noted by several States and local air pollution control agencies, shutdownswhich occurred prior to a State's establishment of the emissions inventoryused in its attainment demonstration should not be available as credit.In general, States have at least implicitly taken account of all such preinventoryshutdowns and curtailments in their nonattainment plans. It would constitute``double counting'' of these emissions reductions to allow their unrestricteduse as shutdown offset credits by potential new sources. Accordingly, emissionsfrom a new source whose construction is premised upon such shutdowns cannotreliably be said to be consistent with RFP, unless the emissions inventoryexplicitly treats the emissions from the shutdown source as current actualemissions. The EPA believes that the final rule should also reflect the concerns ofState commenters who pointed to a range of practical difficulties in verifyingthe existence and extent of past emissions reductions. Accordingly, inorder to afford individual States maximum flexibility, while ensuring thatprior shutdown credits will result in RFP, the final rule in Subpart Iprovides that the time limit for use of shutdown credits may be any reasonablecutoff date after August 7, 1977, as specified in the SIP, so long as thatdate is on or after the date of the most recent emissions inventory usedin the plan's EPA-approved demonstration of attainment. In addition, wherethe emissions inventory explicitly lists the emissions from a previouslyshut down or curtailed source as still existing, the State may choose toallow such emissions for offset credit purposes. The Offset Ruling hasbeen revised to contain the same cutoff date provisions as Subpart I. Inaddition, the final rules provide that, in order to be creditable, priorshutdowns must be permanent, quantifiable, and federally enforceable whenused. The final rules also promulgate the proposed deletion of the work forcenotification provision. This requirement served no purpose in assuringattainment of the NAAQS and, thus, its retention would be inappropriate.E. Banking of Offsets <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Background </ITAG>The current Offset Ruling contains a provision, subparagraph IV.C.5., whichaffirms that a permitting authority may give credit under the Offset Rulingfor past ``banked'' reductions and which sets some boundaries on the circumstancesunder which it may grant this credit. The third and last sentences of thatsubparagraph also contain guidance on the approvability, under section173, of a permit program that would give credit for ``banked'' offsets.Since adding that guidance to the Offset Ruling in January 1979, EPA hasissued regulatory guidance on banking for purposes of nonattainment NSRin the form of andSection; 51.165(a)(3) (formerly andSection; 51.18(j)(3))and policy guidance in the form of the ETPS (51 FR 43814, December 4, 1986).This newer guidance renders the guidance in the Offset Ruling superfluous.To avoid confusion, EPA proposed to delete the third and last sentences.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Public Comments </ITAG>Comment on this issue was limited but generally favorable. Several commenterssupported what they termed ``the removal of artificial distinctions againstthe use of shutdown emissions,'' noting that crediting of such emissionswas very important, especially in California, where shutdowns are the onlyarea source of emissions credit. Others agreed with EPA's proposal to eliminatethe banking guidance in the Offset Ruling in favor of more recent guidancein the ETPS. One State agency opposed the proposed deletion of the two provisions inthe Offset Ruling because, until the final ETPS is promulgated, there wouldbe no official regulatory replacement of these limitations on abuse ofemissions reduction credits. Finally, one commenter stated that the ETPSshould be combined with a formal emissions banking and trading program,subject to notice and public comment, in order to reduce confusion andprovide the maximum flexibility in the use of credits. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. EPA Analysis </ITAG>The EPA is today deleting the subject provisions, as proposed. They areunnecessary in view of the ETPS. F. Health and Welfare Equivalence <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Background </ITAG>The five sets of PSD and nonattainment NSR regulations define ``major modification,''roughly, as any change at a major source that would result in a ``significantnet emissions increase'' in any one of certain pollutants. ``Net emissionsincrease,'' in turn, is defined as the amount by which the sum of: (1)The increase in emissions from the proposed change, and (2) any creditableincreases and decreases elsewhere at the source would exceed zero (e.g.,40 CFR 52.21(b)(3)(i)). This process of summing increases and decreasesin emissions in order to avoid NSR is commonly referred to as ``netting.''The regulations restrict the creditability of some decreases in emissions.One provision, in particular, allows credit for a reduction only to theextent that it has approximately the same qualitative significance forpublic health and welfare as the increase from the proposed change (e.g.,id. andSection; 52.21(b)(3)(vi)(c)). Examples of specific concerns are variationsin pollutant carcinogenicity and volatile organic compounds (VOC) reactivity,and in air quality impact as a result of different stack heights. Several of the industry petitioners in the <T3>CMA </T3>case have challenged that restriction on the creditabilityof emissions reductions. The basis of this argument is that the relevantstatutory definition of ``modification,'' section 111(a)(4) of the Act,includes any change ``which increases the amount of any air pollutant emitted.* * *'' This reference to ``amount'' is argued to mean that the definitiononly applies to the quantity of air pollutants, by weight, rather thanto any qualitative criteria regarding amount of impact, such as toxicityor impact area. The EPA proposed to delete this requirement on those grounds,stating that NSR of modifications primarily is triggered by quantitativeincreases in emissions and, therefore, it lacks authority to limit nettingcredits based on purely qualitative reasons. In addition, the proposalconcluded that, even if EPA did have authority to impose this restriction,it could not do so because the wording is unlawfully vague. In conjunction with the issue of health and welfare equivalence, EPA proposedto exclude certain compounds from the term VOC's as that term is used inthe PSD and nonattainment regulations, because EPA has determined themto be negligibly photochemically reactive and, hence, not precursors ofozone. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Public Comment on Health and Welfare Equivalence </ITAG>a. <T3>Comments Generally Favoring the Proposal.</T3> Industry commentersgenerally supported the proposal. Some stated that there is no reason todifferentiate between types of emissions which contribute to ambient levelsof a criteria pollutant. For example, all reductions in particulate matteremissions help to attain the TSP standard. Consequently, if EPA's concernis with fine particulates, it should directly address them in a rulemaking.Similarly, these commenters stated, mechanisms from other programs_suchas RACT, NSPS, and national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants(NESHAP)_exist to address toxic pollutants directly. Some commenters alsocriticized the restriction as vague and potentially burdensome if case-by-caseanalyses were required. One State air quality program added that it hasauthority to ban netting in any case where such could cause hazardous emissionsproblems. b. <T3>Comments Generally Opposing the Proposal.</T3> Several commenters representingState air quality programs opposed the proposal, arguing that it shouldbe the quality, not merely the quantity, of emissions that determine creditabilityfor netting purposes. If this were not the case, trades could proceed thatallowed increases in toxic pollutants in place of criteria pollutants,or between large and small particulate emissions, even though there wouldbe a significantly greater adverse effect on public health and welfare.A Federal agency noted that the rerouting of fugitive emissions througha stack to achieve a net decrease in emissions could still cause greaterambient concentrations of a pollutant further downwind, such as at a nationalpark. Since a PSD applicant would thereby avoid having to demonstrate alack of adverse impact on such a downwind Class I area, the FLM's abilityto exercise his affirmative responsibility to protect air quality-relatedvalues would be impaired. Therefore, the only creditable emissions decreasesshould be those for which points of emissions have the same emissions characteristics,and the FLM should be notified if a Class I area would be potentially affectedby emissions from a source modified through such netting. An environmental group stated that the <T3>Alabama Power Company </T3>v.<T3> Costle</T3> case, contrary to EPA's assertion in the proposal, providesno authority against a health and welfare equivalency criterion since noparty raised this question in the litigation, and the court had no occasionto address it. The language from the court opinion which EPA quotes is,therefore, simply not relevant.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Public Comment on Exclusion of Nonreactive VOCs. </ITAG>a. <T3>Comments Generally Favoring the EPA Proposal. </T3>Several commenterssupported EPA's decision to exclude certain compounds from the term VOC'sas that term is used in the PSD and nonattainment regulations. A petroleumcompany urged EPA to also delete propane, acetone, methanol, acetylene,and tertiary alkyl alcohols from the definition, arguing that these compoundsare also nonreactive. A manufacturing company urged EPA to delete fluorinatedorganic compounds (citing an EPA letter that such substances were negligiblyphotochemically reactive); a chemical company urged EPA to delete tetrachloroethylene(citing an EPA report); and a trade association urged EPA to clarify thatother nonreactive VOC's may, in the future, be added to the present listas soon as they are shown not to be precursors of ozone. One commenter, although supporting the EPA proposal, urged that the newdefinition of VOC not be retroactive to previous applicability determinationsor emissions banking determinations, since this would create an administrativenightmare and change the basic principles under which industry has beenoperating. b. <T3>Comments Generally Opposing the EPA Proposal. </T3>A local air qualityprogram opposed the proposed definition of VOC unless EPA institutes measuresto consider the compounds deleted from the definition under separate provisionsof the Act. That commenter noted that these compounds are a potential publichealth hazard. Another commenter stated that the proposed exclusions from the VOC definitionwere shortsighted since a number of the substances to be deleted are candidatesfor listing under section 112. The commenter stated that the effect ofthe proposal would be to encourage greater use of these substances whichmay in the future have to be regulated more tightly than the average hydrocarbon.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. EPA Analysis </ITAG>Upon consideration of the public comments and of its duties and authorityunder the Act, EPA has decided to retain the current regulation allowingnetting credit for a reduction in emissions only to the extent that thereduction has ``approximately the same qualitative significance for publichealth and welfare'' as the proposed emissions increase. However, as explainedbelow, today's action clarifies that the implementation of this regulationis temporarily limited in certain ways, described below, pending furtherimprovements in EPA's ability to assess qualitative differences in theeffects, including toxic effects, of pollutants that are similar in quantity.In view of substantial arguments on both sides of the health and welfareissue, EPA has reassessed the question of EPA's authority to promulgatethis regulation. The EPA has concluded that congressional intent behindthe adoption of section 111(a)(4) to guide the definition of ``modification''for NSR purposes is ambiguous, and that EPA possesses adequate authorityto maintain the health and welfare requirement. Industry commenters have urged EPA to strictly construe the operative phrase``* * * which increases the amount of any air pollutant emitted * * *''so as to exclude consideration of qualitative impacts. However, althoughstrict construction might require exclusive focus on the amount of pollution,it would also demand close adherence to the ``any air pollutant'' portionof the definition. This could lead to anomalous results that no party hassought, and which would not further the statutory purposes of the Act.This is because section 302(g) defines ``air pollutant'' very broadly toinclude: <ITAG tagnum="21">Any air pollutant agent or combination of such agents, including anyphysical, chemical, biological, radioactive (including source material,special nuclear material, and by-product material) substance or matterwhich is emitted into or otherwise enters the ambient air. </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">However, under the PSD program, EPA, to date, has equated ``any airpollutant'' with pollutants ``subject to regulation under (the Act)'' asthat term is used in section 165(a)(3). In contrast, in the ``NSPS'' programfrom which the definition is borrowed, EPA has consistently treated ``anyair pollutant'' as referring only to those pollutants for which a performancestandard has been promulgated under section 111 for the specific sourcecategory in question. Thus, a strict reading of section 111(a)(4), together with section 302(g),might require vastly expanded regulation, under both the NSPS and NSR provisionsof the Act, of any air pollutant, including discrete subspecies of criteriapollutants, regardless of whether such pollutant is otherwise regulatedunder the Act or the program in question. In the context of NSR nettingcalculations, such a reading would require that netting be strictly quantitativeby focusing on the amounts of individual air pollutant agents, yet be qualitativein nature by allowing only netting of air pollutant agents of the sametype. There is no indication that Congress required EPA to administer the Actin this fashion. Rather, EPA believes that there is an inherent tensionbetween the statutory terms ``amount'' and ``any air pollutant,'' and thatcongressional intent is thus ambiguous. Where a clear expression of legislativepurpose is lacking, EPA may interpret statutory language reasonably soas to further the general legislative purposes (see <T3>Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. </T3>v. <T3>NRDC, </T3>467 U.S. 837 (1984)). Here, EPA believes that the centralpurposes of the Act, to protect public health and welfare (see sections101(b)(1) and 160(1)), and to allow increases in pollution only after carefulevaluation of all the consequences (see section 160(5)), will be servedby retaining this regulatory requirement, because it helps ensure thatmodified sources that would otherwise ``net out'' of review do not inadvertentlycause a significant adverse health or welfare impact. This position isalso supported by <T3>Alabama Power Co. </T3>v. <T3>Costle, </T3>wherein the court recognized that EPA retains substantialdiscretion in applying the bubble concept (see 636 F.2d at 402). Some commenters have argued that these goals should be pursued exclusivelythrough the NSPS and NESHAP programs, not through NSR. The EPA's responseto these commenters is two-fold. First, the Act clearly does not limitcontrol of these problems to only those two programs. Indeed, the Act providesfor complementary, but distinctly different, roles for all three programs.Section 112 addresses ``hazardous air pollutants,'' defined as those which<ITAG tagnum="21">* * * cause[s], or contribute[s] to, air pollution which may reasonablybe anticipated to result in an increase in mortality or an increase inserious irreversible, or incapacitating reversible, illness (section 112(a)(1)).</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">This program provides for the identification of these hazardous airpollutants and control of emissions from source categories designated byEPA. The PSD provisions of the Act provide a very different focus and standardfor regulation. For example, the PSD program addresses all major sourcesand is designed ``to protect public health and welfare from any actualor potential adverse effect'' from any air pollutant (section 160(1)).Second, NSR possesses an inherent speed and flexibility in its ability to protect public health and welfare that those other programs lack. TheNSR programs provide timely and focused responses to health and welfareissues arising from specific sources. These responses complement the typeof long-range and general studies performed pursuant to sections 111 and112. The NSR programs also address all pollutants from each source in everysource category, while the NSPS and NESHAP programs do not.Although EPA believes it has adequate authority to consider differencesin the toxicity of various subspecies of pollutants in netting calculations,EPA has not yet set forth criteria by which to delineate these differencesso as to ensure reasonable and nationally consistent implementation. Thus,while EPA believes that sources should not trade decreases in compoundsof lesser toxicity (considered in terms of acute or carcinogenic effects)if this results in adverse health or welfare consequences, specific limitationson sources' ability to net must await further development of objectivecriteria by which to judge these differences. Toward this goal, EPA now solicits comments to be used in the developmentof guidance for implementing this provision. Certainly, an exact and detailedapproach to ranking all toxics is impossible; there are 4,500,000 chemicalslisted by the American Chemical Society, with 70,000 chemicals in commercialuse and 1,000 new ones added each year. Furthermore, toxicity is an art,as well as a science, with the level of knowledge constantly evolving.It would be irresponsible and contrary to the Act, however, to ignore potentialpublic health problems because of the inability to precisely discriminateamong all chemicals. Prudent regulatory strategy entails the broad examinationand classification of toxic air pollutants in such a way as to providefor reasonable and predictable implementation of the NSR program whilepreventing appreciable increases in public health  risk. There are a variety of sources of information to assist permitting authoritiesand affected industry in assessing relative risk of toxic air pollutants.For example, the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienistspublishes ``Threshold Limit Values,'' indicating safe worker exposure concentrationsfor numerous pollutants. The Carcinogen Assessment Group provides a broadclassification system for carcinogens, as well as unit risk factors forcarcinogenic potency. Such sources of information on toxicity could wellserve as the basis for classifications of pollutants for purposes of determiningappropriateness of netting transactions. One initial approach might beto group the toxic air pollutants likely to be encountered into four orfive classifications based on variances in toxicity, with netting creditsbeing allowed for reductions in any other chemical contained in the samegroup. In the meantime, section 116 allows, and EPA encourages, the States tocontinue development and implementation of their own air toxics programs,including case-by-case analysis of proposed netting transactions. The EPAwill continue to closely monitor these State efforts, and will considerthe approaches being used by the various States (such as prohibiting nettingbetween certain groups of toxic subspecies, or establishing netting ratiosbetween certain groups of toxic pollutants) in developing specific Federalregulatory requirements in this area. The EPA also agrees with those commenters who pointed out a vagueness problemwith the area impact aspect of the health and welfare equivalence regulation.Specifically, industry comments criticizing netting restrictions determinedby area or concentration of pollutant impact, such as stack height, plumetemperature, and impact on visibility or vegetation, are well taken. Absentmore specific guidance on the reach of this provision, it is unduly vagueand, hence, difficult to implement in a consistent manner. Consequently,EPA policy will be to limit this aspect of the health and welfare provisionunless, and until, specific guidance on how to address these comparisonsis issued. Accordingly, the area impacts aspect of the regulation will apply onlywhere the State has reason to believe that the reduction in ambient concentrationsfrom the emissions decrease will not be sufficient to prevent the proposedemissions increase from causing or contributing to a violation of any NAAQSor PSD increment, despite the absence of a significant net increase inemissions. In such cases, an applicant for a federally enforceable permitmust demonstrate that the proposed netting transaction will not cause orcontribute to an air quality violation before the emissions reduction maybe credited. This requirement serves as a ``safety valve'' for circumstancesnot contemplated by the calculation of significance values in the NSR regulations,and is amply specific to allow consistent application. This requirementis also appropriate because it provides, as to sources that would be consideredmajor but for their ability to net out of NSR review, air quality protectionequivalent to that mandated under section 165(a)(3) of the Act. As indicated above, the concerns addressed by this regulation relate todifferences in the toxicity and impact areas of emissions subject to anetting calculation. However, many common types of emissions can be consideredthe same pollutant in terms of health and welfare impacts. In addition,many industrial processes are sufficiently similar that they can be consideredas having an equivalent impact on health and welfare. Therefore, wherenetting takes place between the same or similar combustion  units, fuels,or processes, equivalency may, in most cases, be assumed. As is the casewith all other criteria for the crediting of emissions reductions, it isthe responsibility of the source attempting to net emissions to support,where necessary, a finding of equivalence of health and welfare equivalence.Nevertheless, EPA has no evidence to indicate that the requisite healthand welfare equivalency demonstration has been burdensome or has resultedin any undue delay or prohibition in the construction of a major modificationto a major source. Furthermore, any burdens that currently exist wouldbe reduced as a result of today's action. The EPA is also promulgating a new definitional provision that, in general,excludes certain organic compounds from the term ``VOC'' as that term isused in the PSD and nonattainment regulations.\10\<NOTE/> The compounds are those that EPA has determined to be negligiblyphotochemically reactive and, hence, not important precursors of ozone(see 42 FR 35314, July 8, 1977; 44 FR 32043, June 4, 1979; 45 FR 32424,May 15, 1980; 45 FR 48941, July 22, 1980; 54 FR 1987, January 18, 1989).They are, therefore, not considered to be VOC's within the meaning of thePSD and nonattainment regulations. The purpose of the revision is to clarifythat increases and decreases in emissions of those compounds are to beignored completely in any applicability determination with respect to VOC's.Although this is a new provision for the NSR regulations, it does not changethe chemicals on  EPA's list of organic compounds determined to be negligiblyphotochemically reactive. Thus, it does not change any EPA applicabilitydeterminations, since this list has already been relied on in those transactions.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ It would not exclude a compound if it were subject toan NSPS or NESHAP. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Miscellaneous </ITAG>A. Executive Order 12291 Under Executive Order 12291, EPA must judge whether a regulation is a ``majorrule'' and therefore subject to the requirement for preparation of a RegulatoryImpact Analysis. The EPA has determined that this regulation is not a ``majorrule,'' because it either relaxes a regulatory requirement or retains existingprovisions and will not have any significant effects on the economy. This regulation has been submitted to the Office of Management and Budgetfor review under Executive Order 12291. Any written comments from thatoffice, and EPA's written responses to any such comments, have been placedin the docket for this proceeding and are available for public inspectionat the times and place described earlier in this preamble. B. Paperwork Reduction Act The information collection requirements contained in this rule have beenapproved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisionsof the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq. </T3>and have been assigned OMB control number 2060-0003. The public reporting burden resulting from this rulemaking is estimatedto decrease 2,920 hours overall as a result of today's rulemaking. Thisestimate includes time for reviewing instructions, searching existing datasources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing andreviewing the collection of information.Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of thiscollection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden,to Chief, Information Policy Branch, PM-223, U.S. Environmental ProtectionAgency, 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460; and to the Office of Informationand Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.''C. Economic Impact AssessmentThe requirement for performing an Economic Impact Assessment under section317 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 7617), does not apply, because this regulationdoes not make ``substantial revisions'' to existing regulations. Theserevisions are not ``substantial,'' because they either relieve a currentregulatory burden or retain existing provisions.D. Regulatory Flexibility Act CertificationAs required by section 3(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C.605(b), I certify that this regulation will not have a significant adverseimpact on any small entities, because it relieves an existing regulatoryburden and imposes no significant new burdens.E. Effective DateAs stated earlier in this notice, this rule is effective immediately uponpublication in the <T4>Federal Register. </T4>The EPA has concluded that, under section 307(d)(1)of the Act, the requirement of section 4(d) of the Administrative ProceduresAct, 5 U.S.C. 553(d), for a 30-day waiting period before making a ruleeffective is not applicable.F. Federalism ImplicationsUnder Executive Order 12612, EPA must determine if a rule has federalismimplications, i.e., substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationshipbetween the national government and the States, or on the distributionof power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Forthose rules which have federalism implications, a Federalism Assessmentis to be made. The Executive order also requires that agencies, to the extent possible,refrain from limiting State policy options, consult with States prior totaking any actions that would restrict State policy options, and take suchactions only when there is clear constitutional authority and the presenceof a problem of national scope. The Executive order provides for preemptionof State law, however, if there is a clear congressional intent for theagency to do so. Any such preemption, however, is to be limited to theextent possible.This final rule either retains the current rules or provides increasedState policy options. The only change with federalism implications is theaction which allows use of certain emissions reductions (e.g., prior shutdowns)in certain areas for offsets. Previously, such reductions could not beused. The change increases State policy options, allowing them to prohibit,use, or partially use these reductions as a part of their air quality managementplans.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>40 CFR Part 51Administrative practices and procedures, air pollution control, intergovernmentalrelations, reporting and recordkeeping requirements, ozone, sulfur oxides,nitrogen dioxide, lead, particulate matter, hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide.40 CFR Part 52 Air pollution control, ozone, sulfur oxides, nitrogen dioxide, lead, particulatematter, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: June 12, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">William K.

In addition,the shutdown or curtailment is creditable only if it occurred on or afterthe date specified for this purpose in the plan, and if such date is onor after the date of the most recent emissions inventory used in the plan'sdemonstration of attainment. Where the plan does not specify a cutoff datefor shutdown credits, the date of the most recent emissions inventory orattainment demonstration, as the case may be, shall apply. However, inno event may credit be given for shutdowns which occurred prior to August7, 1977. For purposes of this paragraph, a permitting authority may chooseto consider a prior shutdown or curtailment to have occurred after thedate of its most recent emissions inventory, if the inventory explicitlyincludes as current ``existing'' emissions the emissions from such previouslyshutdown or curtailed sources. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) Such reductions may be credited in the absence of an approvedattainment demonstration only if the shutdown or curtailment occurred onor after the date the new source application is filed, or, if the applicantcan establish that the proposed new source is a replacement for the shutdownor curtailed source and the cutoff date provisions of section IV.C.3.(i)are observed. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * * </ITAG>6.
