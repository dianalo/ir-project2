Notice ofthe proposed rule change appeared in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of June 9, 1989. \2\<NOTE/> No comments were received. On June 20, 1989, DTC amendedits proposal. \3\<NOTE/> As discussed below, the Commission is approving the proposedrule change.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1981). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26886 (June 2, 1989),54 FR 24778 (June 9, 1989). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Letter from Karen G. Lind, Associate Counsel DTC, to EsterSaverson, Jr., Branch Chief Division of Market Regulation, Securities andExchange Commission (June 20, 1989). <ITAG tagnum="84">I. Description of the Proposal </ITAG>The proposal amends DTC's rules and procedures to allow DTC participants,who are not already Fund/SERV members, access to NSCC's Fund/SERV system.\4\<NOTE/> DTC participants acting in their capacity as mutual fundagents will not be eligible to participate in DTC's Fund/SERV program;instead, mutual fund agents must participate in Fund/SERV directly throughNSCC. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ Fund/SERV is a centralized, automated processing systemfor mutual fund purchases and redemptions. On November 20, 1987, the Commissionapproved NSCC's proposal to amend its rules and procedures in order tooffer Fund/SERV as a permanent service to its participants. <T3>See</T3> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 25146 (November 20, 1987)52 FR 45418 (November 27, 1987). <T3>See also</T3> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 22928 (February 20,1986), 51 FR 6954 (February 27, 1986), (approving Fund/SERV as a pilotprogram); Securities Exchange Act Release No. 24088 (February 10, 1987),52 FR 5228 (February 19, 1987) (continuing Fund/SERV as a pilot program).The proposal will allow DTC participants to communicate mutual fund purchaseand redemption orders to DTC before 4:00 p.m. (New York time [``NYT''])for transmission to NSCC and subsequent re-transmission to mutual fundprocessors (NSCC's Fund/SERV members who receive purchase and redemptionorders on behalf of eligible mutual funds) on any business day (``tradedate'' or ``T''). DTC participants will be able to transmit these ordersto DTC through DTC's Participant Terminal System (``PTS'') network.\5\<NOTE/> DTC will transmit those orders to NSCC, in one batch, by7:00 p.m. NYT that day. Once received, NSCC will assign a system controlnumber to each order and review them to ensure that the data is submittedin acceptable format. \6\<NOTE/> NSCC will return any orders that do not meet the format criteriato DTC. At 8:00 p.m. NYT of trade date, NSCC will forward those ordersthat are in compliance with NSCC's criteria to the appropriate mutual fundprocessors. NSCC also will re-transmit all orders (rejected as well asaccepted) to DTC for internal tracking and auditing purposes. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ DTC's PTS network is an electronic system that permitsdirect communication between DTC and its participants, enabling participantsto effect book-entry movements and other account related activity via remoteterminal. On December 30, 1983, the Commission approved DTC's use of thePTS network. <T3>See</T3> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 20519 (December 30, 1983),49 FR 966 (January 6, 1984). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ NSCC, however, will not check the accuracy of the datasubmitted by Fund/SERV participants.Within two business days following trade date (<T3>i.e.</T3>, T + 1 or T + 2), the mutual fund processors will transmitto NSCC confirmations, rejections and orders that are not yet either confirmedor rejected. NSCC will convey this information to DTC, who will make theinformation accessible to its participants through the PTS network. DTCparticipants may submit corrections concerning the money values and thenumber of shares involving confirmed trades before 7:00 p.m. NYT of T +2. Mutual fund processors, however, must reconfirm these corrections sothat corrected orders can supersede the original orders. NSCC will deleteany unconfirmed orders by 12 noon NYT of T + 2, and will inform both DTCand the mutual fund processors of any such deletions. \7\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ DTC's Fund/SERV interface service allows participantsto transmit through the PTS network information pertaining to purchaseand redemption orders as of a specific date, including trades not submittedon trade date or trades previously rejected from the system. These ordersare denominated ``as-of'' orders and a participant may submit these ordersat any time within six months after trade date. There are two differencesbetween processing as-of and regular orders:<ITAG tagnum="28">(1) Mutual fund processors have up to three business days to eitherreject or confirm an as-of order. This may result in settlement up to sevenbusiness days (instead of the normal five) after the trade has been submitted.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">(2) While participants do not have the capability of correcting anas-of order, a participant has up to the first day after confirmation bythe mutual fund processor to delete an as-of order if it disagrees withthe confirmation issued by a mutual fund processor.</ITAG>On the fourth business day after trade date (T + 4), NSCC will create afile of all the confirmed orders that have been released for settlementby mutual fund processors on the next business day (T + 5 or ``settlementdate'').\8\<NOTE/> On the morning of settlement date, DTC will make this fileavailable to its participants through the PTS network, and will transmittickets to participants for all items due to settle on that date. DTC willnet participant Fund/SERV payment obligations with other participant NDFSsystem payment obligations. At 5:00 p.m. NYT of T + 5, DTC participantswill pay thier money settlement obligations to DTC in next-day funds inaccordance with DTC's ``Money Payment'' Rule.\9\<NOTE/> DTC, in turn, will settle directly with NSCC at approximately5:00 p.m. NYT of the same day.\1\\0\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\Confirmed redemptions of book shares registered in streetname settle automatically, normally on T + 5. Between T + 4 and T + 14,mutual fund processors must submit separate releases to settlement forconfirmed redemptions of book shares registered in the customer's nameof for physical shares so that these transactions can be settled throughFund/SERV. At 12 noon NYT of every business day between T + 4 and T + 13,NSCC will issue daily reminders to mutual fund processors and DTC aboutconfirmed redemptions for which releases to settlement have not been received.At 11:00 a.m. NYT of T + 14 NSCC will delete redemption orders that havenot been released to settlement by mutual fund processors. NSCC will conveythis information to DTC and the mutual fund processors by 12 noon NYT ofthis same date.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\<T3>See </T3>The Depository Trust Company Rules, R. 9.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\A mutual fund processor will settle with NSCC at 1:00p.m. NYT of T + 5 if it is in a net debit position. Fund/SERV settlementsbetween NSCC and its participants and between mutual fund processors andNSCC, if the former are in a net credit position, will occur at 5:00 p.m.NYT of T + 5 in next day funds.DTC, like NSCC, does not guarantee Fund/SERV transactions. DTC must notifyNSCC before 10:00 a.m. NYT of T + 5 that it has ceased to act for a participantin order to limit its liability. If DTC gives NSCC timely notice regardingits decision to cease to act for a participant who has defaulted on itsFund/SERV payment obligations, DTC's liability to NSCC for any debit amountrelating to said participant would be limited to an amount equal to thatof the participant's required Fund/SERV contribution. If DTC notifies NSCClater than 10:00 a.m. NYT of T + 5 that it has ceased to act for a participant,and NSCC cannot reverse or recover the credits made to mutual fund processorswith respect to said DTC participant, DTC will pay NSCC all amounts due,resulting from the participant's use of Fund/SERV.\1\\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\1\<T3>See </T3>DTC-NSCC Fund/SERV Linkage Agreement, andSection;3 (June 29,1989).DTC will require each Fund/SERV Participant to make additional deposits(Fund/SERV contributions) to DTC's Next-Day Funds Settlement (``NDFS'')Fund. A participant must deposit the required amounts in the manner prescribedby DTC's Rules.\1\\2\<NOTE/> The amount of the Fund/SERV contribution will be based onthe daily settlement debits that a participant may have with any one eligiblemutual fund family.\1\\3\<NOTE/> If a participant has daily Fund/SERV settlement debits ofno more than $100,000 with respect to any fund family, the participantmust contribute $5,000. If a participant has daily Fund/SERV settlementdebits greater than $100,000, but not more than $500,000, with respectto any one fund family, the participant must contribute $10,000. If theparticipant has daily Fund/SERV settlement debits of more than $500,000with any one fund family the contribution amount will be $20,000. DTC willcalculate on a monthly basis each particpant's contribution to determinewhether the participant's daily debits for any one fund family exceed thepoint at which a higher Fund/SERV Fund contribution is required.\1\\4\<NOTE/> DTC will collect any additional required deposits monthly.On a quarterly basis, DTC will return any money resulting from a decreasein a participant's level of required contributions.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\2\<T3>See </T3>The Depository Trust Company Rules, R. 4, section 1, para.4.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\3\A fund family is the conglomerate of mutual funds controlledby the same mutual fund processor.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\4\Pursuant to its Rules, DTC may require a participantto deposit additional amounts to the Fund/SERV Fund. The Depository TrustCompany Rules, R. 4, section 1, para. 3.DTC will allocate any Fund/SERV related losses pursuant to the allocationplan set forth in its Rules.\1\\5\<NOTE/> If a Fund/SERV interface participant defaults on a paymentobligation, DTC will use that participant's Fund/SERV contributions and,if necessary, the defaulting participant's deposits to the NDFS Fund.\1\\6\<NOTE/> Upon demand, the defaulting participant must deposit allamounts necessary to cover the resulting Fund/SERV contribution and NDFSFund deposit deficiencies.\1\\7\<NOTE/> The defaulting participant will remain liable for the fullamount of the obligation arising from its default even if it ceases tobe a member.\1\\8\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\5\ <T3>See</T3> Letter from Karen G. Lind, Associate Counsel DTC, to JuliusLeiman-Carbia, Staff Attorney Division of Market Regulation, Securitiesand Exchange Commission (July 18, 1989).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\6\ The Depository Trust Company Rules, R. 4, section 3.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\7\ <T3>Id.</T3><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\8\ <T3>Id.</T3>If DTC is unable to recover its loss by assessing either the defaultingparticipant's Fund/SERV contributions or its deposits to the NDFS Fund,DTC will recover the remaining loss by assessing the contributions of allFund/SERV interface participants (other than the participant[s] responsiblefor the loss) <T3>pro rata,</T3> based on each Fund/SERV interface participant's contributionlevel at the time DTC discovered the loss.\1\\9\<NOTE/> DTC's loss allocation plan requires a participant to satisfythe deficiency in the amount of its required contribution level, resultingfrom the <T3>pro rata</T3> assessment, as soon as required by DTC.\2\\0\<NOTE/> DTC can make additional <T3>pro rata</T3> charges to a Fund/SERV participant (other than the participant[s]responsible for the loss) for the same loss or liability.\2\\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\9\ DTC's Board of Directors may elect instead to applythe existing retained earnings or undivided profits or portions thereof.If these amounts are not enough to cover the loss, DTC may apply the Fund/SERVcontributions on the same <T3>pro rata</T3> basis as if it had chosen not to use the existing retainedearnings or undivided profits. <T3>Id.</T3> R. 4, section 4.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\0\ <T3>Id.</T3> R. 4, section 5.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\1\ <T3>Id.</T3> R. 4, section 8.In order to limit its liability for future losses or additional assessments,a participant may give notice of its intention to terminate its dealingswith DTC within ten business days after receiving notice of a <T3>pro rata</T3> charge.

DTC's Rationale for the Proposed Rule Change</ITAG>DTC believes the proposal is consistent with section 17A of the Act \2\\3\<NOTE/> because it promotes the prompt settlement of mutual fundtransactions by providing its members an automated method to purchase,redeem, and register mutual fund securities with a mutual fund, throughDTC. DTC believes that this automated processing system will reduce thedependency on less efficient methods, such as telephone calls and writtencorrespondence, which are currently used by DTC participants to settlemutual fund purchases. DTC also believes that it has established appropriaterisk management procedures, such as requiring additional clearing fundcontributions and setting a loss allocation scheme, in order to protectitself and its members from unreasonable risks associated with Fund/SERVactivity.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\3\ 15 U.S.C. section 78q-1 (1981).<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Discussion</ITAG>The Commission believes that DTC's proposal is consistent with section17A of the Act because it encourages the use of new data processing andcommunications techniques to promote a linkage between two clearance andsettlement facilities, which will result in more efficient, effective andsafe procedures for the clearance and settlement of mutual fund transactions.As the Commission has stated before, Fund/SERV achieves this goal by offeringone centralized processing location where mutual fund purchase and redemptionorders are submitted in one standardized format.\2\\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\4\ <T3>See generally</T3> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 24088, <T3>supra</T3> note 4, at 5230-1; Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26506(January 31, 1989) 54 FR 6051, 6052 (February 7, 1989).DTC's proposal will foster cooperation with NSCC, allowing DTC participantsto eliminate multiple communications and settlement arrangements betweenthemselves and mutual fund processors. This simplification will in turnreduce the risks of failed deliveries, inadequate transaction records,operational errors and, ultimately, financial insolvency.\2\\5\<NOTE/> Thus, the Commission believes that the proposed interfacewill encourage the use of more efficient means of communication betweenbroker-dealers and mutual fund processors, which will in turn result ina more effective clearance and settlement system for mutual fund transactions.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\5\ <T3>See</T3> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 24088, <T3>supra</T3> note 4, at 5230.In its release setting forth the standards used to evaluate clearing agencyregistration applications, the Division of Market Regulation noted thatit is proper for a ``clearing agency to establish by rule an appropriatelevel of clearing fund contribution based, among other things, on its assessmentof the risks to which it is subject.'' \26\<NOTE/> DTC proposes to require from its Fund/SERV participants additionalfund contributions, in order to protect itself and its membership fromrisks that could arise in connection with the Fund/SERV interface. Thisadditional contribution requirement will be based upon a participant'slevel of Fund/SERV activity. The Commission believes that the proposedcontribution requirement reflects the level of risk associated with Fund/SERV.\27\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\26\ Securities Exchange Act Release No. 16900 (June 17, 1980),45 FR 41920, 41929 (June 23, 1980) (footnote omitted).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\27\ The Commission has approved similar contribution requirementsfor this service at other clearing agencies. <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26377 (December 20, 1988),53 FR 52546 (December 28, 1988) (Approving, <T3>inter alia, </T3>contribution requirements for NSCC's new categoryof Fund/SERV members); <T3>see also </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26506, <T3>supra </T3>note 24 (Approving, <T3>inter alia, </T3>contribution's requirements for the Midwest ClearingCorporation's proposed interface with NSCC's Fund/SERV service).Fund/SERV contributions will be separate from a DTC member's NDFS depositrequirements and will not be subject to the ceiling for DTC's NDFS Funddeposits. Moreover, DTC proposes to restrict the use of Fund/SERV contributions(other than contributions by a participant responsible for a loss incurredby DTC) to satisfy losses caused by Fund/SERV participants' defaults. Whilethis would limit DTC's ability to mutualize default risks, the Commissionhas previously stated that `` `clearing fund protection can be organizedresponsibly in different ways at different clearing agencies.' '' \28\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\28\ <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26377, <T3>supra </T3>note 27, at 52548 (quoting Securities Exchange Act ReleaseNo. 19230 [November 10, 1982] 47 FR 51969).The Commission believes the proposal is likewise consistent with DTC'sstatutory obligation to safeguard funds and securities in DTC's possessionor control.\29\<NOTE/> While DTC will not guarantee Fund/SERV settlement payments,the proposal includes safeguards against losses due to member defaults.If, for example, DTC ceases to act for a participant, it can limit itsliability to NSCC by notifying NSCC before 10:00 a.m. NYT of T + 5, sevenhours before NSCC pays its Fund/SERV participants in next day funds at5:00 p.m. of that same day. This action will enable NSCC to withhold paymentand reverse any transactions made with respect to the defaulting DTC participant.Moreover, if DTC notifies NSCC after 10:00 a.m. NYT of T + 5, but before8:00 a.m. NYT of the next business day, NSCC can stop payment on any fundspaid to a mutual fund processor as a result of transactions by a DTC defaultingparticipant.\30\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\29\ 15 U.S.C. 78q-1(b)(1)(F) (1981).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\30\ In the Order approving the Midwest Clearing Corporation'sproposed interface with NSCC's Fund/SERV, the Commission discussed a similarplan designed to avoid risks associated with Fund/SERV. <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26506, <T3>supra </T3>note 24, at 6053.In the event DTC and NSCC can neither cancel payment instructions nor recoverthe resulting payments, DTC will first attempt to cover any losses associatedwith Fund/SERV by using the responsible participant's Fund/SERV contributions.DTC will use the contributions of all other Fund/SERV participants if thedefaulting participant's Fund/SERV contributions and deposits to the NDFSFund are insufficient to cover the loss. The defaulting member, however,will remain liable for the amount of the default and, unlike other Fund/SERVparticipants, will not be able to limit its liability by ceasing to dobusiness with DTC. By placing the burden of covering Fund/SERV relatedexposures, first, on the defaulting party and, then, on the other participants,DTC not only distributes liability equally among those benefiting fromFund/SERV, but also provides for a maximum assessment, thus allowing participantsto ascertain, at any given time, their maximum potential liability.\31\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\31\ <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 16900, <T3>supra </T3>note 26 (Discussing the importance of a participant's abilityto ascertain its maximum potential liability).<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Conclusion</ITAG>It is therefore ordered, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, thatthe proposed filing (SR-DTC-89-09) be, and is hereby, approved.<ITAG tagnum="21">For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuantto delegated authority.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jonathan G.
