Right ventricular volume andright ventricular ejection fraction obtained by DS ventriculography werewell correlated with those by geometric methods. In 43 patients withleft ventricular ejection fraction of 55 % or greater, end-diastolicvolume, stroke volume, and ejection fraction in the right ventricle didnot differ from those in the left ventricle ; however, both the 1/3 ejectionfraction and the peak ejection rate of the right ventricle were significantlylower than those of the left ventricle, suggesting the different modesof left and right ventricular contraction. In the other seven patientswith chronic left ventricular failure, right ventricular systolic functionmay be preserved, even when left ventricular function is severely impaired.Digital subtraction ventriculography has proved to be a simple, usefulmethod in the quanlitative and quantitative assessments of the rightand left ventricles.
