If the fines are levied, they would be the highest theOccupational Safety and Health Administration has ever imposed on atelecommunications company, the agency said.   ``It's a very widespread case,'' said Edward Jerome, an officialat OSHA's Albany regional office. ``The company has the ... healthand safety resources to get into compliance.''   The company will challenge the fines, said New York Telephonespokesman Tony Pappas. ``This company has always been interested insafety,'' Pappas said. ``A willful violation is not something thecompany would do.''   OSHA said it cited New York Telephone for 16 serious violations,62 willful violations and two other violations. The citationsresulted from 26 surprise visits to New York Telephone workplacesaround the state in July.   OSHA claimed the company knowingly violated OSHA standards byfailing to maintain safety information for each hazardous chemicalused at workplaces and failing to provide employees withinformation and training on proper handling of hazardous materials,according to Jerome.   The agency also accused the company of failing to properly testemployees for possible exposure to lead and failing to properlystore compressed gas cylinders.   OSHA said it found employees at an office in Schenectady werenot trained to deal with organic solvents, compressed gases, leadedsolder and CRC 5-56, a petroleum distillate in an aerosol can.   ``We are not alleging employees were overexposed to thesematerials,'' said Anthony DeSiervi, OSHA assistant regionaladministrator in New York City.   However, Marsha Love, regional health and safety director forthe Communications Workers of America, said the union was concernedabout what its members might have been exposed to.   She said the company had eight years to implement safetymeasures under state law that was superseded by federal law inAugust 1988.   The union has been talking to the company for some time aboutsafety concerns, Love said. She said the CWA finally went to OSHAin July, and the agency began inspecting New York Telephoneworkplaces.</TEXT></DOC>
