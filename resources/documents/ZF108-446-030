Hilmes, is an advocate of Total Quality Management.andP;  How will TQM changethe nuts and bolts of the acquisition process?andM;BORLAND: TQM really is an initiative to review entire processes.andP;  There maybe some nuts and bolts changes in terms of how we go about saying things andwhat we put in our request for proposals.andM;We might take out certain provisions that don't add to the quality of theproduct we're seeking.andP;  We've already begun reviewing the processes wherebywe come up with the specifications, the RFPs and the acquisition strategy.andO;We're asking if each of those processes adds to the value of the productwe're going to deliver.andM;The product isn't the RFP or the contract.andP;  The product is the system.andP;  I seeTQM more as a process change than as a nuts and bolts things.andP;  We've alreadystopped doing things around here that were just part of the process.andP;  Westopped and asked, &quot;Wait a minute.andP;  Why do we do this?&quot;andP;  In some cases wefound out we did it only because we always had one it.andM;GCN: Can you give an example of something that doesn't add value?andM;BORLAND: We routinely used to include a lease-purchase analysis in theevaluation methodology of our RFPs.andP;  We now question whether it's applicablein every case, and sometimes we don't put it in.andM;If advance analysis tells you that purchase is the route to go, and you havethe money to do a purchase, there's really no reason to solicit leaseproposals or go through a very time-consuming analysis of lease vs.andO;purchase.andM;GCN: You've said that Hilmes' predecessors gave birth to the InformationMission Area concept and now he's taking it beyond its formative stages.andP;  Hasrunning ISSAA changed under Hilmes' leadership?andM;BORLAND: Our tasks haven't broadened but are magnified.andP;  There's more to dobecause Gen.andP;  Hilmes is challenging all of us with more initiatives.andP;  He haschallenged us to apply a management assistance approach to our delegation ofprocurement authority oversight program.andM;After we extend DPAs, we're going to be more directly involved in helping tonavigate what's in the DPAs.andP;  Heretofore, we've depended on a more passiveapproach.andP;  What we've going to do now is get more active and make somevisits.andM;GCN: Let's talk about protests.andP;  It seems to be the exception rather than therule when there is no protest of a major award, such as the Corps ofEngineers Automation Plan (CEAP).andP;  Can you point to things in the CEAPacquisition that explain why no one protested?andM;BORLAND: I think we talk about protests too much.andP;  In CEAP, we ran a realtough demonstration [among the competitors].andP;  The tougher your demonstration,the greater your credibility with the vendors.andP;  When it comes time to tellthe losers why the winner won, they know the thing was carried out in aprofessional, rigorous manner.andM;Vendors are less likely to jump to the conclusion, &quot;I've got to protestthis,&quot; when they know they were given a fair chance in a tough technicalcompetition.andP;  Plus -- I'm going to say this and I wish I could get theconcept across without being inflammatory -- we had three responsibleofferors in CEAP.andM;GCN: Do a number of protests come from bidders who were not in a position towin the contract in the first place?andM;BORLAND: No, that's not what I mean.andP;  We had offers from three companies whohave shown an ability in the past to listen to what we have to say, toanalyze it, put it together with everything else they know and carefullydecide whether they need to take litigious action.andM;Now, that's not to imply that everybody who makes a protest just jumps up anddoes it.andP;  What I'm telling you is that we had an opportunity to talk to thesefolks and explain to them why they lost, and they were in a receptive mode.andM;Often we find ourselves telling people why they didn't get a procurement, butall they're doing is gathering information to build their case on.andP;  That'sunfortunate.andM;When you can see that, you're tempted not to tell folks why they lost.andO;That's not what we do.andM;I don't want to see us get into a mode where we don't talk to people simplybecause we're afraid of giving them evidence to sue us.andM;I tell the people here at ISSAA that we've got a procurement process and webelieve we did it well.andP;  So we shouldn't be afraid to tell anybody what theresults were.andM;What happened in CEAP is that the two companies that didn't win were in alistening mode.andP;  They were disappointed as hell but willing to listen.andM;GCN: Debriefing losers must be difficult.andM;BORLAND: I haven't been in a debriefing in years, but it is a very difficultsituation.andP;  Even though we're dealing at arms' length with offerors, afteryou go through a procurement as a contracting officer or contract specialistor project manager, no matter how arm's length it is, a relationship ofmutual respect starts to build.andM;You start to have an affinity for the folks you're trying to make this dealwith, who are in the competition.andP;  It's very difficult to sit across fromsomeone you've been working with a year or two and tell him he didn't win.andO;Debriefings are not fun.andP;  It's kind of like going to the dentist.andM;GCN: On the surface, it would seem that all the thrashing around about theethics law has made communication between the government and industrydifficult.andP;  Yet you have an imperative to keep the lines of communicationopen.andP;  Can you do it?andM;BORLAND: I think the atmosphere that's grown up around the legislationcertainly has made communication more difficult.andP;  And to the extent that it'smade it more difficult, it also has stifled communication.andP;  ISSAA has takensome hits because of this lack of communication.andM;We reach a point in the procurement process where we quit taking to people.andO;We don't have a point picked out because no two procurements are the same.andO;But there comes a time where we've got to stop talking and go to writtencommunication for no other reason than that it becomes manageriallyimpossible to make sure everyone has the same kind of information.andM;You really have to make sure when you're giving out information that you'renot giving it to a few selected folks.andP;  That's the reason communication isdifficult.andP;  You can't have a free-for-all, open environment, and keepeverything even.andM;Aside from the integrity and ethics issues, there's also a managerial issue.andO;It's expensive and resource-intensive to keep the information free-flowingand even.andM;GCN: Does ISSAA play a role in generating functional descriptions?andM;BORLAND: The only role we play is in their association with the RFP.andP;  Wedon't help build them, we don't do any of the analysis that goes into makingthem up.andP;  Our job is to make sure that when it's done, when we put it in theRFP, it's suitable for a competitive procurement and it's congenial witheverything else that's in the RFP -- the format for the proposals and allthat.andM;It isn't in our purview to get in there and question functional requirements.andO;It's out of our scope and out of our area of expertise.andM;GCN: Do you think the procurement agency should have more of a role?andM;BORLAND: Not the procurement agency.andP;  The IMA authority needs to worktogether with the functional authority to make sure we're not allowingautomation to drive functional requirements, or that we're nor automatingantiquated functional requirements based on pre-automation days.andP;  I think theexpression of functional requirements needs to take the technology account.andM;GCN: How do you feel about the program managers that you're doing these buysfor?andP;  Are they sayvy enough in the acquisition side of things, or are yousometimes speaking a different language?andM;BORLAND: By and large, we understand each other.andP;  Now, that doesn't mean it'sa bed of roses for every PM all the time.andP;  But we usually have a professionaland productive working relationship.andM;There are mysteries to the procurement process.andP;  It's almost a black art thatsometimes we have a hard time expressing to project managers.andP;  But if we keepworking with them, pretty soon they understand.andM;By the same token, there are times when we have to keep our ears and eyesopen so when the project manager comes and tells us something, we're willingto say, &quot;By God, he's right.&quot;andP;  Do we talk a different language?andP;  Yes, we dosometimes.andP;  But we can communicate.andM;By the way, I think the project managers are getting better and better.andP;  Theservices are spending more money on training the project managers before theyput them in the job.andP;  It used to be we'd put somebody out there who wasbright and energetic.andP;  Now we're arming them with the background and thetools they need.andM;GCN: You're a civilian running a military agency.andP;  Has that ever caused youany problems?andM;BORLAND: Never in my entire career.andP;  The reason we do this stuff is for thesoldier.andP;  Everything we do is for the individual.andP;  We buy and install thesesystems because somehow they affect the capability or effectiveness orquality of life of each soldier.andP;  By and large, all civilians know that andact accordingly.andM;I think it's good that there's a civilian in charge of this agency, forcontinuity reasons.andP;  At senior levels, civilians tend to stay in theirpositions longer in the military agencies.andM;You know, when we talk about communication, when we talk about the ability todo business, there has to be some modicum of familiarity between the buyerand seller.andP;  I don't mean that everybody parties together, but we need toknow one another.andP;  We need to be acquainted to the point that if someone hasa problem, they feel like they can call me up right away and say what theyhave on their mind and not have to dance around.andP;  If they know the person incharge, they can do that.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
