The remains of Tropical Storm Allison, which have dumped rain onthe South for more than a week, left a trail of damage from theTennessee Valley to the Northeast.   A band of heavy rain pounded the Maryland-Delaware area andPhiladelphia today. The city got 5.5 inches of rain in two hours,with some suburbs logging up to 7 inches. A street in the suburb ofEssington was under 3 feet of water.   Water rushed over tracks along several sections of Amtrak's linebetween Washington and New York. Some trains were canceled andothers had to reverse direction and return to the station.Passengers were bused between stations.   Trains ordinarily leave Washington and New York every half hour,carrying about 20,000 passengers a day.   ``Travel in that whole area is badly snarled and Amtrak trainoperations severly disrupted and will presumably not be back in fulloperation for at least several hours,'' Amtrak spokesman Cliff Blacksaid shortly before noon.   Black said crews would have to assess any damage to track bedsbefore trains could resume.   In western North Carolina, one woman was swept away in her tentTuesday and presumed dead after a creek overflowed its banks in thePisgah National Forest. Her husband was rescued from the tent as itwas carried downstream.   Officials spotted the tent this morning, said Collettsville FireChief Jerry Gragg. ``The best we can gather right now, the tenttraveled 500 to 600 feet before becoming lodged'' in some branches,he said.   The latest fatality brought the death toll to 14 since sinceAllison sloshed ashore in Texas a week ago. Five have died inMississippi, four in Texas, three in Louisiana and two in NorthCarolina.   ``It was unbelievable how many people were up there camping inall the bad weather,'' said firefighter Rusty Dellinger.   Workers rescued about 30 backpackers and hikers stranded by thecreek's swirling waters by Tuesday evening, and officials todaysearched for others who may have been stranded in the rain-soakedBlue Ridge Mountains.   ``I'm a nervous wreck. I've got to get out of here,'' said ElaineSelf, 28. ``It's my first time camping here. I'm never coming back.''   ``I think it's the worst it's been here since the flood of1940,'' said Tom Huskins Jr., general manager of the GrandfatherMountain resort in Avery County, where more than 6 inches of rainfell in 24 hours through Tuesday afternoon.   Avery County Sheriff Clinton Phillips said officials ordered theevacuation Tuesday morning of about 400 people because of fears a32-foot concrete and earth dam across Land Harbor Lake would giveway. State inspectors proclaimed the dam safe but deputies continuedto monitor it.   More than 1{ inches of rain have fallen since Monday, and theNational Weather Service said up to 2 inches more was likely, withup to 4 inches in some areas.   About 60 people returned to their homes Tuesday in Spring City,Tenn., one day after nearly 5 inches of rain forced their evacuationfrom the farming community north of Chattanooga. It was the thirdtime in three weeks floods had forced evacuations in the area.   ``We're kind of getting tired of it,'' said Gene Wright, directorof the Rhea County Emergency Management Agency.   Wright said 400 homes, 21 businesses and seven cars and truckswere damaged by floodwaters that stood up to four feet deep beforebeginning to recede early Tuesday.   Tuesday's storms dumped about 2} inches of rain in theChattanooga area, and more thunderstorms were expected through theweekend.   The Tennessee Valley Authority reported that June's big rainfallproduced the highest runoff into the region's streams in 114 yearsof record keeping _ 4.10 inches.   More rain fell Tuesday on Mississippi, where some cotton andsoybean crops have been ruined and two counties were declareddisaster areas. The Coahoma Sheriff's Office said most of the 200people evacuated from their flooded houses probably would be able toreturn by tonight.   In Texas, an estimated 500 residents in low-lying areas ofLiberty County, northeast of Houston, remained out of their floodedhomes Tuesday because of Allison's heavy rains.   Allison caused an estimated $1 billion in damage in Texas alone,officials have said.   In Dallas, an estimated 9,000 homes were still withoutelectricity in the wake of a storm that swept the city Sunday nightwith winds up to 90 mph.   About 700 homes have flooded in Louisiana in the last week and ahalf as Allison dumped more than two feet of rain in places,authorities estimated.   Officials in Winn Parish continued to watch a small earthen damweakened by the storm and waters continued to rise in floodedneighborhoods of Rapides Parish.   ``Water is rising about 12 inches in a 24-hour time frame,'' saidBill Godron, Alexandria-Rapides Parish Civil Defense director.   ``Of course this is all contingent on no more rainfall,'' Godronsaid. ``We're supposed to have more rain through Friday.''</TEXT></DOC>
