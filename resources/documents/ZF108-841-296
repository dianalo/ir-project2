 A virus may run through the replication orlogic bomb stage soon after it enters a system.andP;  To combatviruses, there are two kinds of antiviral software: the scanner,which checks for virus patterns in programs that are alreadyinfected, and the monitor, which checks code for any viruses.andO;Restricting access is a security concern that is gainingprevalence.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Computer VirusesNetwork ManagementNetworksAccess ControlsPreventive MaintenanceComputer HackersData SecurityData Integrity.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>The Virus ThreatandM;Is there such a thing as a &quot;secure PC network,&quot; or is the phrase merely anoxymoron, much as the fabled &quot;military intelligence&quot;?andP;  Before you answer,take a close look at the PCs and Macintoshes on the network in your officeand consider these points.andM;* Are all of your users' boot diskettes write-protected and thus safe frominfection by virus?andP;  (Most likely, no.)andM;* Does everyone log out of the network every night (not likely), or do theyleave their computers on?andP;  (Probably.)andM;* Are there a few users who can't understand the need for passwords, sosimply don't have one?andP;  (Of course there are.)andM;* Can you call into your network from home without going through a rigorousdial-in/dial-back authentication scheme?andM;* What about physical access to your network resources?andM;* Could an unescorted office visitor call up files on absent worker's PC?andM;* Can a user walk right up to a server and unplug it?andP;  (For that matter, arekeyboards and monitors connected to your servers?andP;  If they are--and theserver isn't locked away--can they be rebooted accidentally?)andM;A Sorry 'Yes'andM;If you can answer &quot;yes&quot; to any of these questions, you're working on a LANthat's a phone call or unauthorized &quot;copy a:*.*c:&quot; away from potentialdisaster--and your network is ripe for a serious breach in security.andM;This could be as innocent as a co-worker taking a peek at another's privatefiles--for example, job-offer letters entered by a secretary oradministrative assistant who doesn't understand the concept of passwords andthus left his or her files open to anyone who knows how to navigate aroundyour LAN's &quot;cyberspace.&quot;andM;Or it might be as serious as an attack by a virus that reformats a networkdrive, or a malicious hacker's call into a database, in search of telephoneaccess codes.andP;  Or it might be ...(fill in whatever particular network-basedresource is most valuable to your organization).andM;Lest anyone who follows such security-naive practices think he or she isalone, think again.andM;&quot;Security gets the short shrift in the corporate environment because it's apain,&quot; says Jon David, a Tappan, N.Y., computer security and virus expert andconsultant to many Fortune 500 companies.andM;&quot;Security is a major problem for the computer world; it is not, however, amajor concern,&quot; David adds.andP;  &quot;[Corporations] always feel it [a securitybreach] won't happen to them, and people in the computer field are learningthe hard way.andP;  Security is like a barn door--the door often does not getclosed until the horse gets out.andP;  No company [employs tight security] untilit's been burned.&quot;andM;Even leading networking vendors don't always follow &quot;safe networking&quot;practices on their own LANs.andP;  For example, at the headquarters of one suchvendor (who shall remained unidentified) it's common practice for workers toleave their networked PCs on for weeks at a time (they've been told by MISthat this reduces wear on personal computers) and logged into the corporatenetwork overnight.andM;Because the company uses e-mail as its primary communications tool--statusreports, the minutes of product-team meetings, and financial numbersregularly appear on e-mail--it leaves a good deal of competitive informationeasily accessible to anyone who can get into the e-mail system.andM;The point isn't to castigate companies who leave security to the CIA.andO;Rather, it's to emphasize how vulnerable a great percentage of networked PCsare to unwanted intrusion.andP;  Such invasions can come in a variety of ways,from the traditional--that is, actual physical break-ins, a la the Watergatescandal of the Nixon presidency--to the electronic, such as a virus, thenosy, unauthorized PC network user, a determined hacker (or disgruntledformer employee), or possibly a corporate spy ferreting out new productinformation.andM;Largest PC ThreatandM;While all of these issues--physical as well as electronic security--areimportant, viruses pose particularly strong threats to networks, says ColinHaynes, director of the Computer Virus Institute.andP;  The institute,headquartered in Ashland, Ore., is a not-for-profit organization thatdisseminates information about viruses and helps companies recover from virus&quot;infections.&quot;andM;&quot;I think viruses are the biggest single threat to the future of informationprocessing technology,&quot; says Haynes.andP;  Why the concern?andP;  &quot;Because (viruses)are so unpredictable and uncontrolled and growing so rapidly, just by sheermathematical progression.andP;  New and more sophisticated viruses are showing upalmost daily.&quot;andM;Jay Nickson, president of anti-virus software vendor OnDisk Software (NewYork) believes that hackers are the No.andP;  1 security problem in networks withdial-in access via modems; for networks without that capability, &quot;then it'sviruses,&quot; he says.andM;A particularly worrisome virus--worrisome because of the base of nearly onemillion NetWare users available to it--turned up in at least one NovellNetWare network this summer, according to Jon David.andP;  The version he saw andtested, a &quot;Jerusalem B&quot; variant similar to one reported in Great Britain inFebruary, had a &quot;logic bomb&quot; set to go off on Friday, July 13, 1990.andM;David believes the virus's trigger was limited to a Friday the 13th, but thedidn't have the opportunity when Novell let him use one of its LAN labs tocheck and see if it would go off on any 13th day of the month.andP;  On thetrigger date, this virus, which David first saw on June 20, would erasecertain DOS and NetWare executable files when a user ran the file, issuing a&quot;Bad command or file name&quot; message.andM;Insidious InfectionandM;While that's bad enough, what &quot;is scary,&quot; claims David, &quot;is that [the virus]bypasses Netware's write-protection [capabilities].andP;  I sat down at a 'clean'node with it and watched the little bugger [the virus] infect other cleannodes.andP;  And it proved it could infect the server without having write-protectprivileges.&quot;andM;&quot;We in the security field get very frustrated,&quot; David says.andP;  &quot;I had a largecompany pay me tens of thousands of dollars to establish an anti-virus policyfor them.andP;  I gave them the policy, and they loved it.andP;  Six months after Igave them my report, they called with a problem, and what they describedsounded like a virus.andP;  It turns out they hadn't instituted any of mysuggestions yet--there was no rush, they said, because they hadn't had avirus.&quot;andM;Another company he worked for wanted him to provide him with a set of LANsecurity guidelines for everything but the cabling plant in its Manhattanbuilding.andP;  &quot;They told me I didn't have to worry about cabling because themanagement had dictated that the cable be in a secured building.&quot;andM;This is short-sighted, he says, because of the ways various network operatingsystems move data around a network.andP;  For example, he says that Novell'sNetWare &quot;is known for sending passwords over the wire in unencrypted form,and you can use a standard off-the-shelf device such as [Network General's]Sniffer to tap into the wire and get every user's password, including yoursupervisor's.&quot;andM;Weak Security OfferingsandM;David also traces some of the PC LAN security problems to the major networksystems vendors' lack of focus on security issues and products: &quot;The majornetwork companies do not seem to have a security orientation or securityabilities, and until the user community demands it, they're not going to putit in.andP;  I see nothing more than minimal security passwords, software accessrights in these products [referring to 3Com's 3+ and 3+Open, NetWare, andBanyan's VINES].andM;&quot;Ultimately, it's unlikely this demand will come from education, becausethere is none.andP;  Users will demand it when they get burned, such as thisNovell virus--a company will sue Novell, or cancel a million-dollar order.andO;And if it happens to the federal government, there will be hell to pay,&quot; saysDavid.andM;OnDisk's Nickson says he often feels a &quot;sense of anger that people can be sonaive--many don't even take intermediate steps, they're not guardingpasswords, they don't know who's on the network.andP;  Other than that, they'redoing fine--until [a virus attacks or a hacker breaks into their network],then they get angry at the person who reports it and they're forced to takerecovery steps later on.&quot;andM;The Elements of SecurityandM;Naturally, protection against viruses isn't the only aspect of security thatmost network managers are concerned with.andP;  Other key issues include physicalaccess to network resources, data encryption/decryption, maintaining dataintegrity through password-security schemes, and enforcing timelybackup/archival practices.andM;At its very basic level, data security can be defined as providing forintegrity and confidentiality.andP;  Corporations employ myriad methods to ensureboth of these--physical access control and environmental safety, passwordschemes, and data encryption.andM;Restricting physical access to network data, as anyone knows, means taking avariety of precautions, including the use of combination or pushbutton doorlocks, card/badge readers, certain biometric devices (e.g., fingerprint orretina-pattern readers), and what are called &quot;mantraps.&quot;andP;  These smallfoyer-like rooms with access-controlled interlocking doors and aclosed-circuit TV system also incorporate card or biometric readers torestrict entry.andM;A truly secure data-protection system also makes provision for fireprevention, detection, and suppression.andP;  While many of the measures requiredto assure a fire-safe environment are self-explanatory--keeping hand-heldfire extinguishers nearby, installing smoke and fire detectors--others arenot.andP;  The National Fire Prevention Association provides excellent guidelinesfor data centers.andM;Using data encryption/decryption devices takes security to its strongestlevel, says Bill Zalud, editor of Security Magazine, a Des Plaines, Ill.,andO;publication that covers all aspects of security, not just computer or LANsecurity.andM;&quot;We look at encryption as a 'deep' security technique,&quot; he explains.andP;  &quot;Itgoes all the way down to basics.andP;  I would guess that those doing encryptionare probably housed in special industries--finance, financial services,defense contractors, and companies where it's mandated&quot; by outside interests,such as the military, which often requires its contractors to work inenvironments as secure as their own.andM;Although data encryption systems provide the extreme in security, fewcompanies have found the need for it, Zalud adds.andP;  According to figurescompiled by the magazine, only five percent of Security Magazine's readersused some form of data-encryption device in 1988; that number rose to 10percent last year.andM;&quot;DES [the Data Encryption Standard, a standard endorsed by the Department ofDefense] is the de facto standard in the financial world, although it's beenunder attack from those who feel they should migrate to a stronger standard,&quot;says Zalud.andM;The resistance to move to the newer Rivest-Shamir-Adelman (RSA) public keycryptographic system comes because &quot;businesses with DES in place don't wantto [change] because of the costs.&quot;andM;The RSA system uses two so-called keys, which are randomly generated numericcodes used to help encrypt data, rather than one, as DES does.andP;  For a numberof reasons--including the fact that it's more difficult to &quot;break&quot; two keysthan one--RSA is much more secure than DES.andP;  (Two Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology researchers this summer announced they had discovered a new&quot;highest&quot; prime number [a prime number can be divided only by itself andone]; because DES relies on a large prime as its key, many encryption expertsbelieve this development weakens DES.)andM;In operation, data-encryption systems require hardware and managementsoftware not needed with regular LANs; for example, network managers whoinstall DCA's 10net Secure LAN product, based on DES, must install andconfigure special adapter boards in each node connected to the LAN.andM;Once installed and configured, the adapters not only encrypt/decrypt dataplaced on and/or taken off the network, they control access to the network.andO;One of the main advantages of data encryption, obviously, is that even if anunauthorized user manages to connect some form of illicit node on thenetwork, without the DCA adapter and the DES key, which can be changed fromsession to session, the intruder can't make sense of the data.andM;But encryption devices can't control the spread of viruses, which remain themost pressing network security issue today.andM;How Viruses Get On BoardandM;Just how does a virus climb aboard a network?andP;  In any of a number of ways,experts say.andP;  Obviously, infection requires someone to introduce an infectedprogram somewhere onto the network.andP;  But those sources may not always be themost likely culprits.andM;For example, using software downloaded from a bulletin-board system is asure-fire way to put your network in jeopardy.andP;  But so is taking a diskettehome, using it on a standalone PC, then taking it back to work and loadingsoftware on the network.andM;On first appearance, there seems little wrong with this practice.andP;  But whatif one of the employee's teenage children calls a BBS to download games orwhatever?andP;  This can unknowingly introduce the virus into the home system'ssystem files, ready to pounce.andM;When mom or pop fires up the PC to finish a work project, the work disketteis contaminated--unknowingly.andP;  Taking it back to work and using it on thenetwork completes the cycle, infecting the corporate LAN.andM;Network managers who let portable PC users tap their laptops into theirnetworks face a similar problem: Who knows what's happened to the portablewhile it was out in the field?andM;Demo Disks a ProblemandM;And how often do a salesperson's demonstration diskettes move from one systemto another in the course of a day's calls?andP;  Each new system the diskette isused in poses a new virus threat.andM;One of consultant Jon David's systems even caught a virus from a computerrepair shop's diagnostic diskette.andP;  And he helped one company through anothersimilar incident.andP;  Although the company's PCs are used only in a productionenvironment, with no outside software introduced at all, one became infected.andO;&quot;A month before, the PC had been out for repair, where the shop introducedthe virus.&quot;andM;After introduction into a system, a typical virus runs through two stages:replication, then the so-called trigger, or &quot;logic bomb&quot; stage.andP;  Some virusesspread incredibly fast, moving from executable program to executable programand system to system (over a network).andP;  Replication by and of itself isn't aparticular problem, however, unless the virus takes up huge chucks of memory(many are terminate-and-stay resident programs) or disk space.andM;The trigger stage, however, can be hellish or just ridiculous.andP;  One virus,the &quot;Yankee Doodler,&quot; plays a tune (yes, it's &quot;Yankee Doodle Dandy&quot;).andP;  Othersdisplay supposedly funny or nasty messages.andP;  Others, as with the NetWarevirus, erase files or totally crash a system--as the February variant of theNetWare virus did to PCs in England, according to David.andM;Haynes believes these &quot;are not as dangerous as the viruses without a visualsymptom, spreading from system to system, setting up a logic bomb that hasn'tgone off yet.andP;  We don't know how many systems have bombs in them ticking awayready to go off.andM;&quot;We've also had cases of a virus roaming the computing environment, movingfrom system to system indefinitely until it finds itself in files appropriateto a particular company.andP;  This means someone could post a virus in one BBSand just sit back and wait for it to do its work,&quot; says Haynes.andM;There are two basic kinds of antiviral software in use to combat viruses,according to Nickson: the &quot;scanner&quot; variety that checks known infectedprograms for virus patterns, and those that monitor (on a user-selectablebasis) code to ensure that it is free of a virus.andP;  The latter notifies thesystem manager as soon as a virus attacks, allowing him or her to take theoffending code out of service.andM;The problem with scanners, says Nickson, is that they're obsolete as soon asthey're released; the discernable &quot;ID&quot; of any new virus developed afterrelease can't be pinpointed by the scanner.andP;  &quot;One guy says his scanner canidentify 21 million different (virus) patterns,&quot; says Nickson.andM;Among the best of this type of program is one called VirHunt from DDI,according to Nickson, whose company manufacturers a virus monitor calledQuarantine.andP;  Another &quot;very good&quot; scanner product is one called Virscan, saysHaynes.andP;  &quot;The PC Virus Control Handbook,&quot; a publication of internationalSecurity Technology, notes that Cleanup, from McAfee and Associates (SantaClara, Calif.) repairs the damage caused by most widespread viruses.andM;And Hackers, TooandM;Another problem many network managers face is keeping call-in hackers out oftheir systems.andP;  &quot;There are people who simply like to play in other people'scomputer systems,&quot; says On-Disk's Jay Nickson.andP;  One of the surprising thingabout most phone-in intruders, he believes, is they do it merely for thechallenge: &quot;In general, hackers just get their jollies out of stealing otherpeople's data, and not doing anything with it.&quot;andM;One of the best ways to avoid unauthorized phone-in access is the use ofdial-back modems; these respond to a call into the network by requiring thecaller to hang up, then phoning only a pre-authorized phone number for theuser.andM;This isn't to imply that restricting access isn't important.andP;  Every one ofthe security experts we talked with emphasized that most companies areunwilling to reveal that they've experienced security breaches, so estimatingthe degree of seriousness that hackers (or viruses) pose is almostimpossible.andM;10 Ways to Thwart Computer VirusesandM;Here are 10 practical measures network managers can take to thwart the entryand spread of a virus in their systems.andM;1.andP;  Always test new software, especially public domain and &quot;shareware&quot;programs, in a standalone test system before copying it to a network.andM;2.andP;  Always write-protect original applications and operating system disks.andM;3.andP;  Always boot from a hard disk, and use only the original write-protectedsystem floppy disk if recovering from a virus or crash.andM;4.andP;  Users of floppy-only systems should always boot from the samewrite-protected floppy, and the boot disk should be made only with theoriginal system disk.andP;  Use distinctive-looking floppies--perhaps colored--asboot disks.andP;  (And don't forget to write-protect them!)andM;5.andP;  Establish and follow a regular back-up program.andM;6.andP;  Search out and delete all extra COMMAND.COM files from networked harddisks.andM;7.andP;  Never use a manufacturer's original application or system diskette asyour day-to-day &quot;working&quot; disk.andP;  In a secure, standalone environment, use theoriginal write-protected diskette to create a working copy of the applicationor system software, then store the original in a secure location for use inan emergency.andP;  (If the vendor has copy-protected the program disk--a raritynowadays--write-protect the disk before using it, then contact the vendor ordealer and demand a backup copy for emergency use.)andM;8.andP;  Establish and enforce a virus-awareness program that educates yournetwork users about the dangers posed by viruses and unauthorized copying ofsoftware onto the network.andP;  In particular, stress the importance of usingcaution when copying games, public domain programs, and applicationsdownloaded from bulletin-board systems to your network.andM;9.andP;  Activate the read-only file attribute for all applications and systemprogram files.andM;10.andP;  Give your network users a contact name and phone number to call if theirPCs begin acting suspiciously.andM;When all else fails--and a virus does attack your network--have a widelyrecommended, commercially available antivirus application (Virusscan is one)handy to disinfect your system.andM;Some ResourcesandM;For a list of basic anti-virus precautions, send a stamped, self-addressed,envelope to: Computer Virus Institute 1132 Old Highway 99 South Ashland, Ore.andO;97520andM;&quot;The PC Virus Control Handbook,&quot;
