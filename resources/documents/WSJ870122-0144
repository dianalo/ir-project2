Ericsson Telefon AB bribedVenezuelan officials.   In Stockholm, a spokesman for the Swedish telecommunications company rejected the allegations as &quot;completely groundless.&quot; He cited a company policy that forbids the payment of bribes and said Ericsson welcomes the investigation.    A Venezuelan congressional committee already is studying the bribery charges in connection with a pending $186.6 million contract for telephone equipment that was awarded by the state telephone company, Cantv, last year to Ericsson, Nippon Electric Co. of Japan and Siemens AG of West Germany.    The charges arise from investigations by the Bogota, Colombia, newspaper El Tiempo since November regarding $3.8 million in alleged bribes paid to Colombian and Venezuelan officials. El Tiempo reported that Ericsson paid nearly $2 million to an unidentified high-level Venezuelan politician between 1978 and 1980.    The congress's president, Reinaldo Leandro Mora, said: &quot;We have urgently requested the attorney general to open an exhaustive and detailed investigation of the activities in Venezuela of Ericsson that could lead to the establishment of legal responsibilities.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
