He and other traders were waiting for more government statistics to be released this week to get an idea of the economy's strength, and they were looking to see how the Reagan administration will fare in the wake of the Tower Commission report.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 2220.47, down 3.52 points, after trading in a 10-point range during most of the session. On the few occasions when the average did start to move sharply up or down, arbitrage programs linked to stock-index futures pushed it back into that narrow range, several traders said.    The decline would have been a bit steeper except for gains in three of the issues that make up the average: American Express, General Electric and International Paper.    Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index fell 1.20 to 283.00, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index was down 0.43 to 161.58. On the Big Board, there were 781 issues advancing and 806 declining.    Volume on the Big Board continued to be unspectacular, with about 156.7 million shares changing hands, compared with 142.8 million Friday.    Traders said the appointment of Howard Baker as the president's chief of staff removed some uncertainty and indicated the president is trying to take a firm grip on his last two years in office.    Referring to Mr. Baker's appointment, Bernard Fortgang, director of block sales at Prudential-Bache Securities, said, &quot;There was some relief in the market that the government didn't go down the drain over the weekend.&quot;    The strength of the economy was a big concern yesterday, especially in the wake of Friday's disappointing news that the U.S. trade deficit grew and consumer prices surged in January. Traders and analysts said they will look closely at this week's reports on leading economic indicators, single-family home sales and employment.    The market was relatively quiet last week, too, and some analysts think the pause will soon lead to a correction.    Mr. Fortgang believes that if the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbs to record territory of 2240 to 2250, people will start looking for excuses to sell. He said nothing fundamental will change, but traders could find excuses in such negative news as the insider trading scandal, the South American debt problems and concern that stocks are overvalued. Such a correction could begin as early as this week, Mr. Fortgang said.    Gene Jay Seagle, director of technical research for Gruntal andamp; Co., said there could be several corrections of 5% to 8% in what he considers a continuing bull market.    &quot;I think any of these corrections are a chance to buy,&quot; Mr. Seagle said, because &quot;the same fuel that has generated the movement of this market all through January still prevails.&quot; He cites the Federal Reserve System's expansive credit policy, heavy amounts of Asian and European capital searching for bargains and relatively low returns from many other investments.    In addition, he said a very large short position is also bullish. Mr. Seagle said that if stock prices drop, short-sellers will cover their positions -- buying shares in the market to replace borrowed shares.    &quot;That money has got to come back into market. Whenever the market pulls back, people on the sidelines start to climb in, the shorts cover and the two things come together&quot; to limit the severity of any correction, Mr. Seagle said. In fact, he thinks that in the next few weeks, stock prices could surge again.    The Dow Jones Transportation Average yesterday rose 4.36 to 940.04, as oil prices dropped for the fifth time in the past six futures trading sessions.    That decline spurred gains in many airline issues. AMR rose 3/4 to 59 3/4, UAL was up 1 to 54 3/4, Delta Air Lines gained 7/8 to 63 7/8, and NWA inched up 1/8 to 71 1/4. But Pan Amwas unchanged, and Texas Air fell 5/8 to 47 3/8.    Meanwhile, oil company stock prices were mostly lower. Atlantic Richfield fell 1 1/8 to 65 7/8, Chevron declined 5/8 to 48 7/8, Phillips Petroleum was off 1/8 to 13, Royal Dutch fell 1 1/4 to 102, Standard Oil dropped 3/4 to 54 5/8, Unocal slid 1/8 to 30, Texaco fell 1/8 to 33 3/4, and Pennzoil declined 5/8 to 76 1/2.    Oil field equipment and service issues also were lower, while shares of air freight and air courier concerns gained.    Money-center bank stocks, which fell much of last week, gained, as did many regional banks. Losing stock groups included technology, computers and savings and loans.    American Express rose 2 3/4 to 76 3/4. The stock has risen more than 8 points in the past three sessions in heavy trading. The company is considering, among other things, selling a partial stake in its Shearson Lehman Brothers unit.    A higher recommendation from Mark Rogers, a paper analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities, helped boost Temple-Inland 2 3/8 to 72 1/2. Mr. Rogers told Dow Jones News Service that he raised his opinion to a &quot;strong buy&quot; from a &quot;weak buy&quot; because of &quot;continuing good news&quot; in Temple-Inland's basic linerboard and box businesses.    International Paper rose 5/8 to 90 5/8, as Mr. Rogers increased his earnings estimates for the concern, as he did for Stone Container, which rose 1 1/8 to 84 5/8. In addition, Stone Container declared a 2-for-1 stock split and boosted its dividend.    Viacom International increased 2 1/2 to 50 3/8 after receiving sweetened takeover bids from two rival suitors. CBS fell 3 3/4 to 157 1/4, and Capital Cities/ABC was off 2 1/2 to 329 1/2. News writers and some production staff belonging to the Writers Guild of America struck the two broadcasters. General Electric, which owns NBC, rose 1 1/8 to 103 3/4.    The Japan Fund, a closed-end fund, jumped 1 5/8 to 17 3/8 after receiving a buyout offer from a group including the Grace family of New York and the son of T. Boone Pickens Jr. Closed-end funds, which invest like mutual funds, have a fixed number of shares outstanding, and they usually trade at discounts to their net asset value. The group offered to buy all the assets of the Japan Fund at 5% below the fund's total net asset value, which it said amounted to $19.61 a share Friday.    News of dividend changes and stock splits drove several issues. Fluor fell 1 3/8 to 14 after suspending its quarterly dividend of 10 cents a share. The company said it will use some of the money to increase production of its North American gold operations.    Waste Management rose 1 3/4 to 71 1/4 after declaring a 2-for-1 stock split and raising its dividend to 18 cents from 14 cents on pre-split shares.    Cincinnati Bell advanced 2 3/4 to 46 1/2. The company declared a 2-for-1 stock split and raised its quarterly dividend on current shares to 48 cents from 44 cents.    Purolator Courier dropped 3/8 to 34 3/4. The company over the weekend agreed to be acquired by a group including management and E.F. Hutton for $268 million in cash and securities, or $35 a share.    Chubb surged 1 7/8 to 72, but the company told Dow Jones News Service it didn't know of any reason for the stock's activity. However, the company noted that the Big Board began trading Chubb options Friday, which some market participants said could increase the volatility of the stock.    In over-the-counter trading, the Nasdaq OTC composite index fell 1.06 to 423.91. Volume totaled about 134.6 million shares, and advancing issues were about even with decliners.    On the American Stock Exchange, the Amex Market Value index slipped 0.01 to 321.75. </TEXT></DOC>
