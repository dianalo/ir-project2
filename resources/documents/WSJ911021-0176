He can produce fancytitles, fade in and out from scene to scene, and add specialeffects. His sideline business has grown so much that &quot;I hopeto be out of {the butcher shop} next year,&quot; he says.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Pustteri is one of a small but growing number ofordinary people who hope to ride a computer wave into adomain once reserved for graphic artists, musicians anddesigners. Some forecasters see new desktop video-productionand multimedia computers turning the untutored into artists.   &quot;To do a multimedia presentation requires you to beproficient in at least three different languages -- music,visual thinking and narrative. The Amiga {personal computer}provides a sense that you can, in fact, do all those things.You can be a one-person creative force,&quot; says Cary Wasserman,a Cambridge, Mass., artist working in photography andcomputer art.   Not everyone is so sanguine. Current products are costlyand complex. And, of course, having the technicalcapabilities doesn't guarantee that a computer user has theartistic sensibility to produce good work. &quot;There seem to bea lot of computer people moving into the arts,&quot; says SidneyAlan Greenblatt, a New York artist and children's-book authorwho creates works with a computer. &quot;Usually it's a littlebetter if they're artists and then move to the computer.&quot;   But for some Americans who grew up watching cartoons,television sports and network-quality productions, the lureof using computers to produce their own animatedpresentations or video effects is irresistible.   Take Mr. Pustteri, the butcher. To do his editing, he usesthe whimsically named Video Toaster, a specially equipped$3,995 Commodore International Corp. Amiga computer made byNewTek Inc. in Topeka, Kan. Last winter he started editingother people's wedding videos made in the 1980s, before videocameras became sophisticated. Sometimes he finds out whatmusic people played at their weddings and dubs that onto thevideo. For people married in an earlier era, he will evenshoot videos of old wedding albums, using special effects toavoid a slide-show look as scenes change. &quot;After the Toastercame out, my business really took off,&quot; he says.   &quot;Multimedia&quot; is the industry term for any technique thatuses computers to combine sound and images. And industryofficials are promoting it avidly, in part because anyoneproducing multimedia has to spend lots of money on powerfulpersonal computers with huge memory disks and expensive colormonitors. Optimists predict a multibillion-dollar marketlater in the decade, but currently relatively few individualsand companies have embraced the concept.   The biggest problem is the large amount of memory requiredto store pictures that have been converted into the digitalform that computers require. Technologic Partners, a New Yorknewsletter publisher, calculates that one minute of actionfootage would require 1,700 megabytes of data. By usingcompression techniques that slightly reduce image quality,the requirement can be cut to about 85 megabytes -- butthat's still four times the capacity of a standard hard disksold on most PCs. Without compression, 20 color photographscan fill up a hard disk.   Another problem is that the more popular computers,including Apple Computer's Macintosh and IBM compatibles,require special equipment. Compact optical disks that looklike the popular music disks can hold lots of information andare compatible with most computers, but they can't be used torecord information.   Scientists and engineers are moving to solve many of theproblems. But meanwhile, pioneers are wrestling with currentequipment.   For video, reviewers say nothing comes close to the VideoToaster, which produces broadcast-quality images and replacesequipment that costs $60,000 when purchased separately by TVstations. Users can make a scene sparkle, change colors ofhair or dresses, superimpose images on backgrounds, and cut,fade and wipe images off screens. Rock star Todd Rundgrenmade a rock video that has run on MTV using the Toaster.Magicians Penn andamp; Teller experiment with it.   George Johnson, owner of Alpha Video andamp; Audio, aMinneapolis video dealer, rents time on the Toaster tocustomers who don't want to buy one. &quot;Businesses come in anddo 3-D animations of their corporate logos,&quot; he says. &quot;Peoplesit down and put together their wedding footage. We have adentist who uses it to show people how they will look withtheir teeth straightened.&quot;   H. Edward Preston, children's minister at Johnson CountyChristian Church in Overland Park, Kan., says that &quot;the VideoToaster has opened up to us professional quality that wasnever before available.&quot; Mr. Preston produces video clips forthe children's Bible-education program, and he has editedvideo taken on a mission trip to Mexico. &quot;Last night I spentfour hours making a little animation of our lettering in 3-Dgoing round and round. I couldn't believe I was doinganimation,&quot; he says.   Other multimedia fans produce corporate presentations. AtGeneral Motors Corp.'s Electronic Data Systems subsidiary,many sales and marketing people use software made byMacroMind for Macintosh computers to do presentations thatare livelier than static slide shows. By showing computerimages on large screens, marketers can select segments of apresentation on the fly as audience response requires --something that is difficult with a sequential slide tray.   Chuck Stevenson, multimedia director for EDS, warns,however, that &quot;it's not for everyone.&quot; The required artisticlevel, he says, is considerably greater than is needed forslide shows. Using MacroMind's Director program on theMacintosh, a presentation creator points and clicks the mouseon icons to incorporate sketches or link sounds to motions.Mr. Stevenson concludes: &quot;There's a steeper learning curvethan for desktop publishing.&quot;   Nevertheless, some users crave the opportunity to jazz uptraditional computer presentations with sound and pictures.Gerald Walsh, a marketer with Hagan Systems Inc.,Minneapolis, uses the Animator software package from AutodeskInc. to keep audiences watching. &quot;There's motion constantly,&quot;he says. &quot;Someone like me who's not a producer can puttogether a program that maintains audience attention. Anytime you have something moving, it gets people's attention.&quot;   Levi Sorrell, a Framingham, Mass., computer consultant isdeveloping talking spreadsheets for Harvard Business Schoolcases that students use to understand business problems.Using a $99 software and speaker package from ArkayTechnologies, Derry, N.H., that lets IBM-compatibles andportables produce clear sound, Mr. Sorrell says: &quot;Soundbecomes a way of reinforcing learning. If we have a case onchain saws and it opens with the sound of a saw cutting wood,it gets the message across real quick.&quot;   Mark Aruda, a Lotus Development Corp. marketer whomoonlights in a rock band, believes that even a few musicalnotes can improve key slides in presentations. He likes touse recorded testimonials from customers, accompanied bytheir pictures. And using the Arkay software, he plays &quot;shortand bright sound clips for introducing people. Mixed with theapplause, it works out well,&quot; he says.   Mr. Greenblatt, the New York artist and children's-bookauthor, recently completed a colorful children's learninggame that takes advantage of the color Macintosh. &quot;All achild needs is a $2,500 computer,&quot; he jokes. And he likesdoing graphics that can be printed out on color printers.   But he wonders whether multimedia will lure a mass market.&quot;It's a great way to get ideas across,&quot; he says. &quot;But as faras everyday people go, I can't imagine someone sending aletter to their mother with animation.&quot;   ---   Mr. Bulkeley is a staff reporter in The Wall StreetJournal's Boston bureau.</TEXT></DOC>
