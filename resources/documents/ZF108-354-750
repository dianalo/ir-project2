 .pl 72andM;- o -andM;Despite all efforts to diversify, Ashton-Tate Corp essentially remains aone-product company, and the dangers of this are highlighted in its firstquarter figures, which saw sales plunge 36.5% to $57m, leading to a $1.0mloss for the period: the company puts the slump in sales down to the factthat sales of the 1.0 release dBase IV have ground to a halt - by commonconsent, the thing doesn't work too well - as users wait anxiously for the1.1 release - for which there is still no delivery date;
