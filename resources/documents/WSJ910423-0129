On his third day in office Secretary Lamar Alexander wasseeking to quell a furor that exploded in December when theEducation Department's top civil rights official saidscholarships granted solely on the basis of race or ethnicheritage are generally prohibited by U.S. civil rights laws.</LP><TEXT>   The statement stunned colleges and universities across thenation, many of which tailor some scholarships to boost theirenrollment of students of specific races or backgrounds.After fierce criticism from civil rights advocates, thedepartment backed off a few days later and announced thatrace-exclusive scholarships were legal as long as they wereprivately funded, not financed or administered by collegesthemselves.   But schools have remained angry and confused. At a newsconference, Mr. Alexander said the review is intended toclarify government policy, not shut off educationalopportunities for disadvantaged students.   &quot;The whole purpose of what we're about to do is to makeabsolutely clear that we're in the business of helpingdisadvantaged Americans go to college. We want you in, notout,&quot; he said.   Mr. Alexander said the Education Department will takeabout six months to study the issue and then will publishguidelines &quot;that clear up confusion about to what extent astudent's race or national origin may be considered as afactor in awarding financial aid.&quot;   In the meantime his message for college and universityadministrators is: &quot;Keep doing what you're doing and try tohelp more people go to college.&quot;   The secretary's announcement relieved some schools.&quot;Secretary Alexander's quick action demonstrates his goodwill and his intent to carry out a thorough, appropriate,considered review of public policy in this area,&quot; said RobertAtwell, president of the American Council on Education, whichrepresents U.S. colleges and universities.   The National Association of Independent Colleges andUniversities said that nine out of 10 of America's privatecolleges and universities have scholarship programsdesignated for minorities, dispensing about $114 million ofaid a year to about 16,300 students. &quot;These figures show justhow critically important minority scholarships are toencouraging and enabling minority students to attendedindependent colleges and universities across the nation,&quot;said Richard Rosser, the association's president.   The question remains as to whether schools' ability totarget aid to minority students will be restricted by thedepartment's new guidelines. The Education Department willwork with the Justice Department to analyze Title XI of theCivil Rights Act of 1964.   Mr. Alexander said that some kinds of race-exclusivestudent aid are clearly allowed under that provision and somearen't. &quot;It's the gray area in between&quot; that the departmenthopes to elucidate, he said. Mr. Alexander said there areways to assist minority students without targeting aid torace-setting up funds for low-income students, for example, adisproportionate number of whom are minorities.</TEXT></DOC>
