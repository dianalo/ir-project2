Miller,special assistant to FDA Commissioner Frank E. Young.   Miller said Wednesday that the U.S. edge was documented in arecent study by the agency. He also noted that an October 1988survey by the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association found that54 U.S. companies had 97 products in some phase of clinicaltesting, while the FDA study found that the Japanese had 24companies with a total of 45 products.   Miller spoke at a ews conference sponsored by theWashington-based pharmaceutical association. The group's president,Gerald J. Mossinghoff, said he was encouraged by findings of theFDA study.   ``Five years ago there were predictions that Japan wouldovertake us in biotechnology by the end of the decade,''Mossinghoff said. ``That has not happened. There is enormousvitality in today's biotechnology research and development in theUnited States.''   Mossinghoff said 70 genetically engineered drugs and vaccinesare in human clinical tests in this country, while 10 others onwhich clinical testing has been completed are at the FDA for reviewbefore they can be marketed.   The total of 80 is fewer than the 97 products cited in theOctober 1988 survey because the association since then has decidedto focus only on drugs and vaccines that result from geneticengineering _ excluding other biotechnology products such assynthetic peptides.   Genetic engineering involves manipulating the genes thatdetermine the fundamental physical characteristics of an organism.   Mossinghoff said that of 182 biotechnology health care patentsissued in the United States last year, 155 had American owners _far ahead of Japan with 15 patents and Western Europe with nine.   The latest survey released by the industry association foundthat cancer is still the main focus of pharmaceutical biotechnologyresearch. More than half _ 45 _ of the products involved inclinical tests or undergoing FDA review are targeted at cancer orrelated conditions.   It also reported that 14 genetically engineered products _almost twice as many as were listed in the association's first suchsurvey last July _ are being tested for AIDS or AIDS-relatedillnesses.   Mossinghoff said the association is concerned about efforts bystates to get involved in ``duplicative and unnecessaryregulation'' of biotechnology, despite the existence of ``acomprehensive regulatory scheme at the federal level.''   He said that in 1988, 10 state legislative measures wereintroduced and three passed _ in Hawaii, Maine and Wisconsin.   Currently, Mossinghoff said, another biotechnology-related billis awaiting the governor's action in Wisconsin while additionalmeasures are pending before legislators in that state, New Jersey,New York, Oregon, Texas and Washington.</TEXT></DOC>
