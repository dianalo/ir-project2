The senior diplomat in London told The Associated Press thatIslamic cultural centers in Bradford, Leicester and Manchester andat least two in London were bases for Iranian and Lebanese membersof Hezbollah, or Party of God, a pro-Iranian extremist group.   Hezbollah members are training British-based Moslems to useweapons and make bombs, said the diplomat, who spoke on condition ofanonymity.   He said Britain's MI5 counter-espionage organization and ScotlandYard's anti-terrorist unit were aware of the terrorist training.Scotland Yard would not comment.   Rushdie, born into a Moslem family in India, is a British citizenand lives in London. He has been in hiding since Iranian leaderAyatollah Ruhollah Khomeini told Moslem zealots on Feb. 14 he shoulddie for his book ``The Satanic Verses.''   Many Moslems believe ``The Satanic Verses'' insults Islam.   In Lebanon on Saturday, the leader of a group allied withHezbollah called on Moslems in Britain to kill the 41-year-oldauthor.   Hussein Musawi, head of Islamic Amal, told Shiite Moslems in thecity of Baalbek: ``We have to take the initiative and speed uptaking part in Rushdie's execution.''   Iran's president, Ali Khameini, reasserted his country'sintention to punish Rushdie.   Speaking to reporters in Bucharest, Romania, where he ended anofficial visit Saturday, Khameini said, ``One man ... allowedhimself to insult the deepest feelings of millions of Moslims in thename of freedom.''   ``This is no longer freedom of thought but a crime, and that iswhy (Rushdie) has to be punished,'' he said.   Rushdie apologized Feb. 18 for any distress ``The SatanicVerses'' had caused, but Khomeini was unmoved. Iranian religiousleaders have put a $5.2 million bounty on his head.   Rushdie, in his first public comments since going into hiding,wrote in a book review published Sunday that he felt a sense ofkinship with novelist Philip Roth, who was criticized by Jews forhis 1959 novel, ``Goodbye, Columbus.''   Reviewing Roth's autobiography, ``The Facts,'' in The Observerweekly, Rushdie said: ``I was able to recognize in myself thecurious lethargy, the soporific torpor, that overcomes Roth while heis under attack; to recognize, too, the stupid, humiliated rage thatleads him to cry: `I'll never write about Jews again,''' Rushdiewrote in The Observer, a London weekly.   ``His responses to being so vilified have been _ if I may beforgiven a personal note _ very moving, even helpful, to thissimilarly beleaguered writer,'' Rushdie wrote.   Iran's official Islamic News Agency reported Saturday thatKhomeini's designated successor, Xasaid Ayatollah Hussein AliMontazeri, said Iran's ``firm stance'' showed the strength of theIslamic republic.   The agency, monitored in Cyprus, also said Montazeri criticizedArab governments for remaining silent on the controversy.   The book has been banned in Egypt and Jordan but has attractedlittle comment from government officials.   Iran has banned the book, as have South Africa, Bangladesh, Indiaand Pakistan. Maylaysia, where Islam is the official religion,outlawed the book Saturday.   Britain last week ordered all its diplomats in Tehran home. Theother 11 nations that belong to the Common Market then announcedthey were withdrawing top-ranking diplomats from Iran.   Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe of Britain said Saturday hewas encouraged by the range of countries that had recalled envoys.   He noted that Canada, Norway and Sweden had joined the 12-nationEuropean Economic Community in withdrawing their diplomatic chiefsfrom Iran. He also said ``a number of other countries,'' which hedid not name, were joining in the condemnation.   Howe praised leaders of predominanlty Moslem nations for notendorsing the death threat and cited Pakistan as an example of aMoslem country that ``has been prepared to uphold the rule of lawagainst violent protest.''   Six people have died in Pakistan in demonstrations against thebook. At least 10 people have died in protests in India, includingnine killed Friday.   On Saturday, India's governing Congress party denouncedKhomeini's death threat.   ``We never subscribe to the views expressed by people who want aterrorist or violent action against an individual,'' the Press Trustof India news agency quoted party General Secretary K.N. Singh assaying.</TEXT></DOC>
