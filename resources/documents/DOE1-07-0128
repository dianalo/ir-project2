Constitution: A nuclearreactor power judging section compares a nuclear reactor output signalwith a reactor output judging value and, if the level of the former exceedsthe level of the latter, outputs a first signal indicating that the outputis higher than the nuclear reactor output judging level. A reactor flowrate judging section compare a reactor core flow rate signal with a reactorcore flow rate abnormal judging value and, if the level of the formeris lower than that of the latter, outputs a second signal indicatingthat the reactor flow rate is lower. When both of the first signal andthe second signal are inputted, an AND circuit outputs a reactor coreflow rate abrupt change scram signal. The signal is inputted to a pilotsolenoid valve for reactor scram. (Yoshino, Y.).</TEXT></DOC>
