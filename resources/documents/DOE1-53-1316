<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-53-1316 </DOCNO><TEXT>The modified dinucleoside monophosphate, N-deoxycytidilyl-(3'-5')-guanosin-8-yl)-aniline(dCprG-An) has been prepared by the phosphotriester synthesis approach,using suitably blocked derivatives of dCp and N-(guanosin-8-yl)-aniline(rG-An). The latter compound was synthesized by a route that featurednucleophilic displacement by aniline upon an 8-bromoguanosine derivative.A number of attempts to prepare N-(deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-aniline (dG-An)by electrophilic substitution, using activated aniline derivatives, failed.Nucleophilic substitution reactions of aniline with 8-bromodeoxyguanosinederivatives afforded only the base, N-(guanin-8-yl)-aniline. The conformationof dCprG-An has been studied by circular dichroism, proton magnetic resonanceand minimized potential energy calculations. A flexible molecule witha mixture of conformers is indicated. Base-base stacked states predominate,in contrast to the case of a dimer containing 4-aminobiphenyl bound tothe 8-position of guanine, where carcinogen-base stacked states are dominant.</TEXT></DOC>
