Angeleno history is replete withsuch incidents. Since the 1930s, the Los Angeles PoliceDepartment consistently has found itself, along with itsvarious chiefs, at the center of controversy. By comparingtwo of the chiefs and controversies of just the past 20years, one can see that little has changed.   During 1970 and '71, after having insisted that aircrafthijackers should be hung on portable gallows that would berolled up to the aircraft that they had commandeered, formerPolice Chief Ed Davis termed the killing of two Mexicannationals by one San Leandro officer and five LAPD officers a&quot;mistake.&quot; Later, he called the indictment of the officersfor murder &quot;a travesty of justice&quot; and the day of theirindictment &quot;a day that will live in infamy.&quot; He termed theindictments &quot;a Western strategy&quot; to win minority votes andwent on to call the U.S. attorney &quot;a swimming-poolBolshevik.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Our current chief, Daryl Gates, has stated that casualdrug users should be put before a firing squad and shot.Moreover, according to Mr. Gates, genetic inferiority causeschoke-hold deaths and Central America is no more than abreeding ground for criminals. In the matter of this recentbrutality, Mr. Gates scolds three of his officers whileurging us to ignore the witness of our own eyes and await theresults of his internal investigation.   However, between these two situations, there is onesignificant, almost contrary, difference. This time, the U.S.attorney is curiously silent and has opted to have the FBIrather than the Civil Rights Division investigate the case.Perhaps to pursue any more aggressive investigation mightcreate political risk for a president who has won hissupporters' praise for a &quot;tough law-and-order&quot; stance and aveto of the Civil Rights Bill.   Whether or not there is a Machiavellian purpose to herchoice of investigators, the U.S. attorney has failed tofollow her own departmental procedures. In so doing, she alsohas failed her duty, and sworn oath, to protect the civilrights of those living in the federal Central District. Whensuch a failure occurs, events like these, as they have for somany decades, will continue to occur, sending a message ofcriminal impunity to local law enforcement.
