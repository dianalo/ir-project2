(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A state grand jury has indicted two formerAtlantic City officials and a city employee on bribery charges inconnection with casino linen contracts, authorities said Thursday.   The indictment charges that former Atlantic City planning boardmember James Bradley misused his office in 1985 and 1986 bypressuring the Sands Hotel andamp; Casino to award a service contract toAtlantic Linen. Also charged is the firm's owner, W. Oscar Harris,former director of the city's housing authority.   City employee Alonzo Bailey Jr., a former chauffeur for AtlanticCity Mayor James L. Usry, also was named in the alleged conspiracy.   ``The grand jury alleged that Bradley, Harris and Baileypressured several hotel casinos for the linen contracts by peddlingBradley's influence with the Planning Board to either expedite ordelay pending proposals and applications by the hotel casinos forthe establishment or expansion of parking facilities,'' said RobertT. Winter, director of the state Division of Criminal Justice.   The indictments were returned Feb. 1 but remained sealed untilThursday.   A second indictment charges Bailey and Byram Ali, an official atthe Atlantic City Bureau of Inspections, with bribery, officialmisconduct and conspiracy.   Winter said the two men are charged with accepting a $250 bribefrom an undercover detective in exchange for a promise they wouldexpedite the approval of a city construction contractor license forthe detective.   The indictment says that when Bailey was negotiating for a linenservice contract with Del Webb's Claridge Casino Hotel, he toldcasino officials that if they wanted approval from the city boardfor expanded parking, ``We're going to have to be compensated.''   The indictment also charges Harris conspired to have his companybid for contracts as a minority owned firm, and then subcontract allwork to non-minority companies.   The indictment alleges that when Claridge President Roger Wagnerdid not award the contract to Harris' company, Harris warned, ``somepeople get put in plastic bags like that.''   The three men also are charged with attempting to pressure theShowboat Hotel Casino for its linen service contract.   Bradley and Ali could not be reached for comment because theyhave unlisted telephone numbers. No number could be obtained forBailey and there was no answer at Harris' home.   If convicted, Bradley, Harris and Ali face a maximum of 30 yearsin prison and fines of up to $300,000, and Bailey faces a maximumprison sentence of 60 years and $600,000 in fines.</TEXT></DOC>
