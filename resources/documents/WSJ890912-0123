Proponents of a higher fourth-quarter ceiling, including several big Persian Gulf producers, were dealt a major setback yesterday as Ginandjar Kartasasmita, Indonesia's influential oil minister, voiced his objections to any change unless quota violations ceased.    Mr. Ginandjar is one of eight leading oil ministers who make up OPEC's market-monitoring committee. The committee will meet in Geneva, beginning Sept. 23, to decide, among other issues, whether the authorized output level for the 13 member countries should be increased from the current 19.5 million barrels a day.    But yesterday, Mr. Ginandjar told a Singapore news conference that he doesn't favor a higher ceiling unless there is clear evidence of compliance with quotas by all the exporters. &quot;If we could be assured there are significant indications that there will be some kind of adherence, we could accept an increase,&quot; said the minister, who was in Singapore to address a petroleum conference.    Until recently, it had been generally assumed that the monitoring committee had a mandate at its Geneva meeting to engineer an increase in OPEC's fourth-quarter ceiling to 20 million barrels a day or, possibly, to 20.5 million barrels. Any official OPEC action requires a unanimous decision by all 13 ministers, and the remaining five already have been invited to Geneva.    Also, even though the ceiling was raised one million barrels a day, effective July 1, a further increase was believed necessary to keep OPEC's production in line with anticipated demand for its oil in the fourth quarter.    Perhaps more important, an increase was backed by Saudi Arabia and several other OPEC heavyweights. It was, in fact, the centerpiece of a budding move in OPEC to provide Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and some other regular quota violators higher output allotments on a permanent basis.    The biggest problem facing OPEC, Mr. Ginandjar said, is the fact that it hasn't been able to reach its reference price of $18 a barrel except for a few weeks in early summer. Asked why OPEC hadn't been able to hold that price, the minister replied: &quot;There are countries that haven't been faithful to their quotas.&quot;    At OPEC's June meeting, Mr. Ginandjar was instrumental in planning the agenda for the September session at which he and others hoped a new and permanent quota basis could be worked out that would eliminate production cheating. Since, however, cheating has become so widespread that it has pushed OPEC's output to the highest level this year -- 22 million barrels a day -- and raised doubt whether a formal boost in the output ceiling would be prudent.    Although a higher ceiling could eliminate some cheating by making more of the excess output legitimate, it might also lead to even higher total output, some ministers worry. And Rilwanu Lukman, the Nigerian oil minister who is OPEC's president, now raises the prospect that no major changes will result from the September meeting.    In his comments yesterday about this month's meeting, Mr. Ginandjar said it was the monitoring committee's self-appointed &quot;task to work on a permanent quota {system} at this Geneva meeting.&quot; But, he added: &quot;I don't think we can do that.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
