Institution-affiliated partyis defined by FIRREA as: (1) Any committee member, director, officer, oremployee of, or agent for, an insured credit union; (2) any consultant,joint venture partner, and any other person as determined by the Board,by regulation or on a case-by-case basis, who participates in the conductof the affairs of an insured credit union; and (3) any independent contractor(including any attorney, appraiser, or accountant) who knowingly or recklesslyparticipates in any violation of any law or regulation, any breach of fiduciaryduty, or any unsafe or unsound practice which caused or is likely to causemore than a minimal financial loss to, or a significant adverse effecton, the insured credit union. These changes are mandatory in nature. Part 747 is NCUA's regulation onadministrative actions, adjudicative hearings, and rules of practice andprocedure. It is therefore necessary to conform the current Part 747 toFIRREA by means of a final rule. <ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis </ITAG>Scope Section 747.01 has been amended to include within the scope of part 747civil money penalties assessed pursuant to paragraph 202(a)(3) of the FederalCredit Union Act. Paragraph 202(a)(3) is a provision added by FIRREA whichauthorizes the NCUA to assess civil money penalties against an insuredcredit union for submitting false, misleading or late reports or information,or for failing to submit reports or information as required. Subpart A_Rules of Practice and Procedure Section 747.101 has been amended to include institution-affiliated partieswithin the scope of the various administrative actions. The section hasalso been amended to indicate that civil money penalties pursuant to section911 of FIRREA amending paragraph 202(a)(3) of the Federal Credit UnionAct may now be assessed utilizing the procedures set forth in subpart D.A new andSection; 747.122 entitled ``Availability to Public of Final Orders''has been added in light of FIRREA's requirement that final enforcementorders and modifications or terminations of those orders be made availableto the public unless the Board determines that such publication would seriouslythreaten the safety or soundness of an insured credit union. Subpart C_Rules and Procedures Applicable to Proceedings Relating to Cease-and-DesistActions Institution-affiliated party has been substituted for director, officer,committee member, employee, agent, or other person participating in theconduct of the affairs of a credit union throughout this subpart to conformit to FIRREA. Section 747.304 has been amended to include the definitionof ``affirmative action'' contained in FIRREA. Section 747.306, TemporaryCease-and-Desist Order, has been amended because FIRREA lessens the burdenwhich must be met by the NCUA Board in order to issue a temporary cease-and-desistorder. Subpart D_Rules and Procedures Applicable to Proceedings Relating to Assessmentand Collection of Civil Penalties There are substantial revisions to this subpart to conform it to FIRREA.Institution-affiliated parties are included within its provisions and thegrounds necessary for assessment of civil money penalties and amounts whichmay be assessed contained in andSection; 747.402 have been revised in lightof FIRREA's broad grant of civil money penalty authority to the Board.Subpart E_Rules and Procedures Applicable to Proceedings Relating to Section206(g) Removal, Prohibition, and Suspension FIRREA substantially rewrites the NCUA's removal, prohibition, and suspensionprovisions. Subpart E has been revised to note that an institution-affiliatedparty is subject to a section 206(g) action and to include the alteredgrounds for which a party may be removed, prohibited, or suspended. Subpart F_Rules and Procedures Applicable to Suspensions Where Felony ChargedThis subpart has been revised to conform to FIRREA's inclusion of institution-affiliatedparties within the scope of this suspension action, and to indicate thata final removal or prohibition action may be taken not only in the eventof a conviction but also if the party agrees to enter a pretrial diversionor other similar program.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Procedures</ITAG>Regulatory Flexibility ActThe NCUA Board has determined and certified that this rule does not havea significant economic impact on a substantial number of small credit unions(primarily those under $1 million in assets). It does not impose an additionalburden upon credit unions. Accordingly, the Board has determined that aRegulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required.Paperwork Reduction ActThe Board has determined that the requirements of the Paperwork ReductionAct do not apply.Executive Order 12612Certain provisions of part 747 apply to federally-insured, state-charteredcredit unions. The changes adopted by this final rule adopt the provisionsof FIRREA. The NCUA Board, pursuant to Executive Order 12612, has determinedthat this rule will not have a substantial direct effect on the states,on the relationship between the national government and the states, oron the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levelsof government. The rule will not preempt provisions of state law or regulation.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 747 </ITAG>Administrative actions, Adjudicative hearings, and Rules of practice andprocedure.<ITAG tagnum="21">By the National Credit Union Administration Board on October 17, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Becky Baker,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Secretary of the Board. </ITAG>Accordingly, NCUA has amended its regulations as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 747_[AMENDED] </ITAG>1.
