American officials previously acknowledged sharing nuclearweapons information only with Britain, and ``U.S.-French nuclearcollaboration has ... been one of the most closely guarded secretsof both governments,'' Princeton University professor Richard H.Ullman wrote in the quarterly Foreign Policy.   The exchange of data means that France is more closelyintegrated than previously realized into the nuclear war plans ofthe North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and the disclosure mightcomplicate efforts to negotiate a deal to sharply reduce U.S. andSoviet strategic arsenals.   ``It may be that public acknowledgement of the program of aid toFrance, and particularly of coordination between U.S. and Frenchnuclear forces, would increase Soviet pressure for the inclusion ofFrench and British forces in any future strategic arms controlregime,'' wrote Ullman.   The British nuclear arsenal, now being modernized, is slated toconsist of 500 warheads by the mid-1990s, and the French plan tohave about 1,000 warheads by early in the next century. The UnitedStates and Soviet Union each have more than 11,000 strategicwarheads, and under the proposed Strategic Arms Reduction Treatywould cut that number to 6,000 apiece.   The U.S. policy of sharing nuclear weapons data with the Frenchwas initiated in 1972 by then President Richard M. Nixon and hisnational security adviser, Henry Kissinger, as a means to draw theFrench more closely into NATO, wrote Ullman. France left NATO'sintegrated military structure in 1966, although it remains withinthe alliance.   Ullman concluded ``in the course of more than 100 interviewsover the past two years with top-level politicians, civilservants'' and others involved in the program that since 1972, U.S.experts have briefed their French counterparts on aspects ofnuclear weaponry including:   _Penetration of Soviet defenses.   _Miniaturization of warhead components to allow development ofMultiple Independently Targeted Re-Entry Vehicles.   _Guidance and propulsion systems, including the chemistry ofsolid fuels for rocket engines.   Moreover, the two sides have shared targeting information aboutthe Soviet Union to ensure that the French and U.S. nuclear bombsdo not interfere with one another, Ullman wrote.   ``The assistance almost certainly has violated U.S. law,''Ullman wrote.   The Pentagon acknowledged some aspects of Ullman's article, butdenied that the data exchange was illegal and declined to discussdetails.   The United States ``has cooperated with France in improving theoperational effectiveness and survivability of its strategicmissile systems, including supporting command and controlsystems,'' said a Pentagon spokesman, reading a statement he saidhad been cleared by the French government and the White House.   ``There have been several meetings involving U.S. and Frenchtechnicians every year since 1972 under the terms of the 1961agreement'' on nuclear cooperation, said the spokesman, who spokeon condition that he not be further identified.   That agreement was amended in 1985 to provide for the exchangeof classified or ``restricted data ... The 1961 agreement providedthe basis for the exchange of nuclear weapons information relatedto military operational requirements,'' said the spokesman.   ``The amended agreement allows certain classified exchanges,focused on enhancing the safety, security, and reliability ofnuclear activities and installations,'' said the Pentagon statement.   The picture that emerged from Ullman's article and the Pentagonstatement was of an information exchange that at first was heavilyin favor of the French, but which in recent years has become morebalanced.   ``The French nuclear program has reached a technical maturitywhich approaches our own,'' the statement said. ``The French forcecontributes effectively to Western deterrence.''   ``Exchanges were aimed at improving our mutual understanding oftechnologies related to nuclear safety,'' the Pentagon statementsaid. ``More recently we discussed measures to deal with nuclearweapons accidents. Exchanges facilitated efforts from both sides tomake their nuclear weapons safe.''   ``The transfer of nuclear weapons, nuclear components ofweapons, source or special nuclear material is not authorized bythis agreement,'' he said.   As required by law, the Senate and House Foreign Relations andArmed Services Committees and senior congressional leaders wereinformed of the 1985 amendment to the 1961 agreement, and theexchange of information was fully legal, the statement said. Theamendment did not require Senate ratification, it said.   Congress was in recess over the Memorial Day weekend and it wasimpossible to determine the extent of congressional knowledge ofthe nuclear data exchange. Senior congressional aides said theywere unaware of details of the agreement, but that it might havebeen so secret that they were not informed.   Ullman wrote that the 1985 amendment ``seems to have goneunnoticed by anyone outside the nuclear weapons establishments ofboth countries.''</TEXT></DOC>
