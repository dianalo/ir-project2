He said the union has already wonacceptable increases to wages and pensions, following a21-hour weekend bargaining session.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;There are just a couple of things to resolve,&quot; he said,including a plan to reopen the currently dormant Sullivanlead-zinc mine, at Kimberley, British Columbia. The proposedtwo-year pact, which the union's bargaining committee hopesto present to striking workers today, would replace one thatexpired June 30, a week before the walkout began.   The accord would cover about 700 currently inactiveworkers at Sullivan, and an additional 2,900 striking workersat Cominco's big lead-zinc smelter complex, at Trail, BritishColumbia. The shutdown at Trail, which at full capacityproduces about 5.8% of the Western world's refined zinc andabout 2.6% of its refined lead, has helped drive up lead andzinc prices in recent weeks.   Reports of an impending settlement sent lead and zincprices plummeting yesterday on the London Metal Exchange.Spot prices for lead and zinc closed at about 38 cents (U.S.)and 70 cents (U.S.) a pound, respectively, down from 41 centsand 75 cents at Friday's close.   Mr. Schmidt wouldn't elaborate on the terms of the wageand pension proposals from Cominco. But a union official saidit calls for a wage increase of about 18% over the two-yearlife of the accord. The average hourly wage at Trail underthe previous pact was 16.82 Canadian dollars (US$14.54).</TEXT></DOC>
