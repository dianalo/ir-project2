WILLIAMS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A new opposition group challenging the CommunistParty's political monopoly has outlined a platform that calls forfree trade unions and end to Soviet domination of the Baltic statesand of Eastern Europe.   The week-old Democratic Union, whose members have been harassedby authorities as ``anti-social,'' said in unveiling the progamFriday that it plans to try to register with the state but expectsto be rebuffed.   At least a dozen uniformed policemen milled around outside asparty organizers gathered in a crowded eighth-floor apartment innorthwest Moscow to discuss plans for political action.   Police made no attempt to stop those entering or leaving.   The group's declaration of goals and principles followed a weekof meetings in which organizers said more than 150 Soviets from 27cities took part.   Yuri Denisov, one of the party's 15 Central Coordinating Councilmembers, told journalists it would try to comply with lawsrequiring groups to register their activity, ``but of course weexpect problems with that and we do not expect to succeed.''   Another coordinating council member, Alexander Lukashev,outlined broad party policies. He said the group aims to present an``opposition'' to the Communist Party's monopoly on power andpolitical thought.   The group opposes the ``Soviet occupation'' of the Baltic statesof Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, and Soviet actions in EasternEurope that have helped keep Communist government in power there,he said.   The party has called for independent trade unions, and on Fridayissued a statement denouncing Polish officials' actions to haltindustrial strikes over the past month in the Soviet-allied country.   ``The Democratic Union comes out in opposition tototalitarianism of political parties,'' the group's statement ofprinciples declares as its first objective.   The party program sets out methods for calling elections andfilling leadership positions, and says funds raised by the groupwill be used for ``informational activity, agitation, printingcosts and organizational needs.''   Party activists complained that their first week was marred by``repressive'' and ``unconstitutional'' actions of the KGB, localpolice forces and the state-run press.   The official Tass news agency denounced the party on Wednesday,accusing the activists of ``slanderous, anti-social activity.''   Dozens of participants were detained by police after meetingslast weekend, with sentences of five to seven days in jail handeddown summarily to four of them, including dissident magazine editorSergei Grigoryants.   Grigoryants, who edits the unofficial magazine ``Glasnost,''remained jailed Friday night and no one had been permitted to seehim, the activists said.   Denisov said the party planned a political conference in thefall, but that details of that gathering had not been worked outyet.</TEXT></DOC>
