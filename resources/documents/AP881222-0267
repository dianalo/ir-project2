(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Control Data Corp., facing a break-evenyear in 1988, says it told its 27,000 U.S. employees they must takefive days off without pay in the first quarter of 1989.   ``That equates to a 7.8 percent pay cut in the first quarter, orabout 2 percent for the year,'' Frank Ryan, a spokesman for thecomputer company, said Wednesday. ``Executives will take anadditional 5 percent pay cut over the first six months of 1989,'' hesaid.   In addition, merit pay raises have been delayed three months andthe company has canceled for the first six months of 1989 its policyof matching a portion of employee contributions to a company pre-taxsavings plan. The company had matched 25 percent of the first 2percent of an employee's cash compensation, Ryan said. The companywon't say how much money these measures will save, he said.   In a letter to employees notifying them of the cutbacks, ControlData Chairman Robert Price said they were ``necessary to regain ourmomentum by showing a profit in each quarter of 1989,'' Ryan said.If Control Data's financial position improves by the third quarterof 1989, employees will be repaid with as many as five extra paiddays off, Ryan said.   The company's 7,000 employees in other countries will not beaffected by the cutbacks.   ``Countries around the world have a variety of labor relationslaws that make it difficult to implement this,'' Ryan said.</TEXT></DOC>
