Battered at the polls in his race for governor, he came tothis south Georgia town to be among black Baptist clergy hehas known since his days as Martin Luther King's deputy. Herecalled past protests. He read from Exodus. And finally hesang, leading the crowd in the cadences of the old spiritual,&quot;Guide my feet while I run this race . . . Don't want to runthis race in vain.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   It was a poignant scene, and the onetime congressman,United Nations ambassador and mayor of Atlanta seemed for themoment a man alone. Days before, he had finished a poorsecond in a crowded Democratic gubernatorial primary. Nowmatched against Lt. Gov. Zell Miller in the Aug. 7 runoff,his trip here symbolized an effort to shore up his base --and to heal himself for the weeks ahead.   Mr. Young's campaign is a laboratory for the evolvingpolitics of the South. No black since Reconstruction has comeso far in pursuit of Georgia's governorship, but he must runnow not only against history but also against himself. Morethan Jesse Jackson or Virginia's new Gov. Douglas Wilder, hehas compiled a long record in executive office. As he reachesout to whites, this record can make Mr. Young a target in hisown community.   Alongside the middle-class leaders of the civil-rightsmovement, Mr. Young was upper crust. Even today, campaigningin a rural farm setting, he is more cool than country. Anordained minister, he speaks earnestly of &quot;service&quot; and&quot;economic development,&quot; but it is his white rival Mr. Millerwho strikes the more-populist chord by championing a statelottery for Georgians.   Hundreds of thousands of voters swamped the Democraticprimary July 17 to back the lottery, and Mr. Young's primarycampaign sometimes seems like a morality play lost in a seaof hucksterism. Few cities are more relentlesslyself-promoting than Atlanta itself, and as the city's mayorthrough the 1980s, the thoughtful former pastor from southGeorgia is inevitably drawn into this upscale world.   When he stepped down from City Hall last year, Mr. Youngand his wife were presented with &quot;his&quot; and &quot;hers&quot; luxury carsby a grateful Chamber of Commerce. Anne Cox Chambers,chairwoman of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and a pillarof the Southern establishment, has given heavily to hiscampaign. And even as he runs for governor, Mr. Young is onretainer to an Atlanta-based international engineering firmthat dispatched him to London this spring.   In last week's primary, Mr. Young won more votes inAtlanta's Fulton County than Jesse Jackson got there on SuperTuesday two years ago; but in working-class black precincts,the former mayor lost critical support to his white rivals.In the same neighborhoods where Mr. Jackson won better than90% of the vote, Mr. Young came out 10 to 20 percentagepoints lower.   Like whites, blacks were drawn to Mr. Miller's promise ofa lottery. But the pattern also shows an uncertainty aboutMr. Young, who is faulted for having aligned himself closelywith the business community as mayor. &quot;I've supported AndyYoung from the day he went into politics,&quot; says Lowell Ware,the 62-year-old editor of a black newspaper, the AtlantaVoice. But this year, Mr. Ware gave no endorsement. &quot;Whatwe're looking for is delivery,&quot; he says of Mr. Young. &quot;He'sgot to start at the grass roots.&quot;   Born just weeks before Mr. Young, the 58-year-old Mr.Miller has led a career that is a portrait of theever-adapting white Southern Democrat. Dubbed &quot;Zig Zag,&quot; herefuses to be an easy foil for left or right. His hero isformer Gov. Ed Rivers, who wore the political galluses of&quot;Old Gene&quot; Talmadge as a young man but who ultimately sidedwith the New Deal against the powerful Georgia demagogue andbusiness ally.   As a young man, Mr. Miller fell in line with thoseopposing civil-rights legislation, but in 1980 he took on theestablishment and the powerful Talmadge legacy in a bitterand unsuccessful primary fight with then-Sen. HermanTalmadge. In 16 years as lieutenant governor, Mr. Miller hasmade the state Senate his own preserve, and as much as hecasts himself now as a reformer, he has political ties tovested interests from highway builders to the state medicalassociation. Until this campaign, he enjoyed a lakeside lotleased from the Georgia Power Co. unit of Southern Co. AndMr. Young yesterday demanded public disclosure of anydeposits by lobbyists or public agencies in a small bankwhere Mr. Miller and his wife are officers and in which theyhold marketable securities of $607,000.   A former Marine rifle-range instructor, Mr. Miller has afeisty, spikes-up style; but he leaves the toughest rhetoricto his professional campaign manager, James Carville, whospent primary day watching the shoot-'em-up film &quot;Die HardII&quot; to calm his nerves. Three years ago, Mr. Carville helpedWallace Wilkinson win the Kentucky governorship on a platformcalling for a state lottery. And the issue fits now into abroader effort by the Miller campaign to paint Mr. Young asthe true elitist, imposing rules while elsewhere obeying hisown code.   In the same vein, Mr. Miller casts himself as the mountainman against urban Atlanta, and runs on a platform intended toput him on safe ground next November against the GOP'smultimillionaire nominee, Johnny Isakson. Sporting a Marinepin and cowboy boots, the former college professor talkstough on drugs while promising a sales-tax exemption forfood; but he finds it harder to explain where he has been asthe state's fiscal problems have evolved. The sales tax, forexample, was raised by 33% only last year, but revenue isfalling below budget projections. Mr. Miller concedes thatthe estimates were high -- and that he never protested. &quot;Noone spoke up about it,&quot; he says.   Mr. Young, outspent by better than 2-1 on television inthe primary, is expected to be on at least even footing inthe remaining days of the runoff. There is a renewed drive inthe black community for more-unified support; but to overtakeMr. Miller, Mr. Young must win between 25% to 30% of thewhite vote. He comes closest in the metropolitan Atlantaarea, but even there his white support last week totaled onlytwo-thirds of what he needs, and it falls off further inrural counties.   No clear emotional issue -- such as abortion rights --separates him from Mr. Miller. And while Mr. Young hastoughened his attack, Georgia is too content to find muchurgency in his message on jobs and economic development.&quot;Tough crowd,&quot; he sighs after leaving a nearly all-whiteunion meeting in Atlanta. Days later he is lobbying inWashington for peanut farmers, whose help he needs amongwhites down the red-clay roads of rural south Georgia.   &quot;Martin is gone, Ralph (Abernathy) is gone, I want heroeswalking around in living color,&quot; says a black minister andfriend. But in interviews, Mr. Young's comments suggest he isready to let slip the racial leadership burden he has helpedcarry so long.   &quot;White people,&quot; he tells a black congregation in Atlanta,&quot;they have to overcome over a hundred years of fear, andnobody preaches that good. Somebody has to move inside themto make them see clearly the character of a man rather thanthe color of his skin. So I ask for your votes, but most ofall I ask for your prayers.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
