LaBELLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Israel on Sunday agreed to a U.S. plan forinitial peace talks with Palestinians but sought Americanassurances the PLO will have no role in the negotiations.   Vice Premier Shimon Peres, leader of the center-left LaborParty, said decision-making inner Cabinet voted 9-3 to acceptSecretary of State James A. Baker III's proposal but asked for``side assurances.''   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens of the right-wing Likud bloc saidthe government was hopeful it would get what it wanted from Baker.   ``The next step will be to get the guarantees from the UnitedStates and then to start talking about the composition of thePalestinian delegation,'' said Avi Pazner, a top aide to PrimeMinister Yitzhak Shamir. He said of the assurances sought: ``Sum itup in one item: no negotiations with the PLO.''   Both Peres and Pazner said Israel wanted the guarantee inwriting.   The talks could be a long time in coming. Baker's plan calls fora Palestnian delegation ``acceptable'' to Israel, and choosing theactual delegates will likely take time.   Israel television reported the government's acceptance of theU.S. plan was based on various assumptions.   One was that Israel would only accept Palestinian delegates fromthe West Bank and Gaza Strip.   Another was that Washington would support Israel's position ifIsrael were forced to leave the talks because ground rules agreedon with Baker had been violated.   The decision comes two weeks before Shamir's scheduled visit tothe United States. He could have expected a chilly reception inWashington had Israel rejected the American plan.   Six months ago, Shamir proposed elections in the occupied WestBank and Gaza Strip to choose Palestinians to negotiate anagreement on self-rule for the 1.7 million Palestinians in theterritories.   Baker's plan calls for a preliminary meeting in Cairo with aPalestinian delegation to discuss implementing the election plan.   Sunday's decision ends the wrangling over the Baker plan betweenLabor and the right-wing Likud bloc, partners in Israel's coalitiongovernment.   But it is certain to increase dissent in Shamir's Likud bloc,whose hard-line members oppose the Baker proposal as a backdoorentry to peace talks for the Palestine Liberation Organization.Israel refuses to deal with the PLO, which it considers a terroristorganization.   Housing Minister David Levy, a leader of the party'shard-liners, said the vote would put Israel in a ``very difficultsituation.''   ``The PLO in Egypt is coordinating positions ... and everyonehere is acting like blind men who don't know what is happening,''he told Israel radio.   Science Minister Ezer Weizman, a Labor left-winger, agreed thevote would open the way to PLO participation but complained thatIsrael should openly say so.   ``Anyhow, we have indirect negotiations with the PLO,'' he toldreporters after the nearly three-hour meeting. ``It is a bithypocritical to say we are not negotiating with the PLO. I think weare still going in the right direction in the wrong way.''   In Cairo, meanwhile, the PLO's executive committee wound up twodays of meetings Sunday to decide if it will accept Baker's plan.   Committee member Abdallah El-Harani was quoted as saying the15-member group ``crystallized a united position,'' but he wouldnot say what the position was.   In the Gaza Strip, Palestinian leader Assad Saftawi, a longtimeassociate of PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, said he and several otherresidents of the occupied territories were invited to Cairo nextweek for meetings with Egyptian officials.   Under Baker's plan, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak will helpform the Palestinian delegation to the Cairo meeting. Last week,Mubarak drew criticism from Israeli officials when he said that ineffect he was only acting as a middleman for the PLO.   Once agreement is reached on holding talks in Cairo, the nextstep in the U.S. plan is for Baker to meet with the Egyptian andIsraeli foreign ministers on the makeup of the Palestiniandelegation.</TEXT></DOC>
