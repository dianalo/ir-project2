The Commerce Department said inventories rose 0.6 percent to aseasonally adjusted $728.4 billion, while sales rose 0.9 percent to$483.7 billion.   The May gain in inventories followed a 0.5 percent climb inApril and was the strongest since a 0.7 percent increase in January.   The jump in business sales came after a month of no change inApril and a steep increase of 1.9 percent in March.   Economists generally take a combination of rising inventoriesand falling sales as a sign of future production cutbacks. However,because sales rose srongly in May, the jump in inventories is lesstroublesome.   ``Although there is inventory accumulation occurring now, it isin line with the fact that sales and production are increasing,''said Bruce Steinberg, an economist with Merrill Lynch. ``If saleswere to drop off, then there would be reasons for concern, butthat's not the situation we're in now.''   Inventories in May were 7.5 percent higher than a year ago,while sales were 7.8 percent higher.   The May inventory buildup was boosted by a 0.8 percent climb atthe retail level, where sales were weakest, a 0.7 percent increaseat factories and a 0.3 percent increase at the wholesale level.   The strength in business sales was paced by a 1.4 percentincrease at manufacturing plants. Wholesale sales climbed 0.6percent, while retail sales edged up only 0.3 percent.   Michael K. Evans, an economic forecaster in Washington, saidmost of the retail inventory overhang occurred because of weak autosales in May.   ``Excluding cars, retail inventories were up only 0.2 percent.... June car sales rebounded very strongly which means carinventories could be coming down,'' he said.   An advance estimate of retail sales in June, released Thursday,showed a 0.5 percent rise, bolstered by a strong 1.2 percent risein automotive buying.   The combination of strongly rising sales and moderately risinginventories held the inventory-to-sales ratio steady at 1.51percent in May, the same as April. That means it would take 1.51months to exhaust inventories at the April sales pace, a ratio notconsidered abnormally high.</TEXT></DOC>
