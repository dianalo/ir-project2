Some want much more thantheir current allotment.   But analysts were skeptical the eight-member committee of theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries would do much morethan review proposals for reworking output quotas assigned eachmember.   Fergus MacLeod, analyst at the investment firm of Barclays deZoete Wedd in London, said he expected ``not very much'' to come outof the meeting that begins Saturday in Geneva, Switzerland.   Failure to reach any meaningful conclusion on current production,however, could be ``very dangerous'' because countries might widentheir oil taps and increase their already high production level, hesaid.   Another analyst, Nick Antill, of London's County NatWest,predicted the ministers would ``leave the fighting until November''when all 13 ministers are scheduled to gather for a key year-endmeeting in Vienna.   ``They will discuss (quotas) but they will take no decision,''said Pierre Terzian, editor of the oil publication Petrostrategiesin Paris.   The ministers are at odds over how the cartel divides up and setsthe ceilings for each country's crude output.   Some countries, like Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, want alarger share of the production pie. Both have been ignoring theirquotas in recent months and pumping at higher levels.   Moreover, Iraq just opened the second phase of a twin pipelineacross Saudi Arabia, which will add more than a million barrels aday to its export capacity. The move increases the likelihood itwill want a higher quota.   Analysts estimate OPEC's current production at close to 22million barrels a day, well over the cap of 19.5 million set in Junefor the last six months of the year.   Prices have been lower than earlier in the year. A basket ofseven crudes monitored by OPEC was priced at $17.04 a barrel lastweek, under the cartel's target of $18.   West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. oil, hasbeen trading in the range of $19.50 to $20 for a 42-gallon barrel.U.S. crude normally sells for about $2 above the OPEC-monitoredcrudes.   Indonesian Oil Minister Ginandjar Kartasasmita was quoted earlierthis month as saying he was not satisfied with the market's recentperformance.   ``We have not been able to reach the $18 per barrel price levelthat we wanted, except for a few weeks earlier this summer,'' hetold OPECNA, the cartel's news agency.   At their June conference, the ministers agreed to begin the toughtask of finding a more acceptable way to figure out each country'stake of the cartel's daily output.   But analysts detected less willingness now _ with higherproduction and weaker prices _ to try to solve the problem.   Nevertheless, they expected OPEC Secretary-General Subroto to putforth proposals for drawing up quotas that would consider onlyoil-related factors. Some members have suggested that quotas takeinto account a country's ``need'' for oil revenue as determined byits foreign debt, balance of payments and population.   While quotas were likely to grab most of the attention, theministers were also expected to decide whether to boost their supplycap to 20 million barrels a day in the last quarter.   An OPEC official, who demanded anonymity, said there was ``aslight possibility'' they would do so.   ``They may want to narrow the gap between the quota and actualproduction,'' said Bahman Karbassioun, an oil consultant in Vienna,Austria.   But he said production ``could go even higher'' if countriesfailed to agree to abide by their ceilings.   The International Energy Agency reported in its Monthly OilMarket Report that the nations lifted output in August to 21.6million barrels a day, the highest so far this year. The agency isan arm of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development,made up of two-dozen Western nations.   The eight-member Long-term Strategy and Price-MonitoringCommittee includes ministers from Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq,Kuwait, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. The other five nations_ Gabon, Ecuador, Libya, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates _ werealso invited to attend.   Saudi Arabia's oil chief, Hisham Nazer, was reported recoveringfrom surgery earlier this month in the United States and was notexpected to attend.</TEXT></DOC>
