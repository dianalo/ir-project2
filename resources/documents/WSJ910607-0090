Shearson Lehman Brothers is refusing to let its brokerssell the new fund, which is managed by Pilgrim Group of LosAngeles.</LP><TEXT>   The dispute between Pilgrim's hot-selling mutual fund andShearson, a unit of American Express Co., has arisen becausethe fund's fattened dividends come at the expense ofshareholders' capital. And that kind of bookkeeping hasShearson executives worried that investors don't realize thetrade-off they're making.   Following Shearson's decision not to sell the Pilgrimfund, at least one other brokerage firm is taking a secondlook at the fund. &quot;We do offer it for sale, but we'reinvestigating the fund further,&quot; says an executive withPrudential Securities Inc., owned by Prudential Insurance Co.of America.   The fund is the $170 million Pilgrim Adjustable U.S.Government Securities Trust, one of a new breed of mutualfund that invests in adjustable rate mortgages. These funds,which yield around 8%, are proving popular with investorsdisgruntled with money-fund yields of below 6%.   In the tussle between Shearson and Pilgrim, the argumentis over how a fund should account for any &quot;marketing anddistribution&quot; fees that it charges. These fees, known as12b-1 charges, are often used to compensate the brokers whosell funds to investors.   What's so unique about the Pilgrim fund? Rather thandeducting the fund's 1% annual 12b-1 fee from the fund'sdividend stream -- which is what most funds do -- Pilgrim isinstead charging three-quarters of these costs against thecapital that shareholders have paid into the fund. This movehas the effect of boosting the dividend the fund can pay outeach month -- but also chipping away at the shareholder'sprincipal.   A spokesman for Shearson declined to comment publicly onthe situation. But in a message recently sent to its brokers,Shearson said the fund's accounting practices had &quot;thefollowing negative impact to shareholders: unnecessaryadditional taxable income and unnecessary return of capital.&quot;   &quot;This has become a cause celebre for no rational reason,&quot;responds Robert Grunburg, Pilgrim's president. &quot;What Shearsonis objecting to is illogical.&quot;   According to industry executives, Shearson was alsoworried that the trade-off between higher monthly dividendsand lower capital wasn't made sufficiently clear in thefund's prospectus.   Pilgrim's Mr. Grunburg scoffs at these concerns. He saysthe fund's 12b-1 fee is clearly disclosed. And whilePilgrim's fund uses different accounting than most other12b-1 funds, Mr. Grunburg notes that deducting the 12b-1 feefrom paid-in capital is no different than the way a regularfront-end sales commission is deducted.   Pilgrim's accounting method for its 12b-1 fee doesn't giveit any advantage when it comes to advertising yields. Formutual fund yield calculations, the Securities and ExchangeCommission insists that a 12b-1 fee is accounted for asthough it were coming out of the dividend stream.   But the Pilgrim fund's peculiar accounting does give itone advantage: The fund can boast a higher dividenddistribution rate. So far that hasn't been an issue, says Mr.Grunburg. He notes that, to date, the fund has advertisedneither its distribution rate nor its yield.   Ironically, Pilgrim was -- for a brief period -- partiallyowned by Shearson. Pilgrim used to be part of First CapitalHoldings Corp., the Los Angeles insurer that has soughtChapter 11 bankruptcy court protection from creditors.Shearson ended up with a stake in the fund group when, in1988, it acquired a major position in First Capital. Butshortly afterward, the fund group was sold to PalombaWeingarten. Mrs. Weingarten's husband, Robert Weingarten, waschairman of First Capital until recently.   The idea of paying a 12b-1 fee out of capital, rather thanout of income, isn't entirely new. In 1985, for instance,Eaton Vance Corp. of Boston introduced its Marathon Group offunds, which each charge a 1% annual 12b-1 fee. Nine of the11 Marathon funds are municipal bond funds.   According to James Hawkes, an Eaton Vance executive vicepresident, the Marathon funds deduct the 12b-1 out ofcapital, rather than from dividends, because of the peculiartax treatment received by municipal bond funds.   With a municipal bond fund, the dividends received byshareholders are exempt from federal taxes, and sometimesfrom state and local taxes as well. But if you have a capitalgain on your fund, that gain is fully taxable. As a result,with a municipal bond fund it makes sense to maximize thedividend income and minimize any capital gains.   &quot;It's bloody complex, believe me, but it works for theinvestor because it gives him a higher tax-exempt incomestream,&quot; says Mr. Hawkes. &quot;We're not trying to play gameshere.&quot;   With the Pilgrim fund, the dividends are taxable, so thatthe way the 12b-1 fee is deducted makes the fund less taxefficient than a fund that uses a regular 12b-1 structure.   The reason: Unlike a regular 12b-1 fund, the Pilgrim fundpays higher dividends, and these are taxable each year.Pilgrim's investors will eventually benefit in the form ofreduced capital gains or increased capital losses, but thatbenefit won't be realized until they sell their fund shares.</TEXT></DOC>
