As Philip Morris, the nation's largest food company, launched its $90-a-share tender offer for Kraft yesterday, the proposed transaction -- which would be the second largest takeover in history -- took on an increasingly hostile tone. Philip Morris filed a lawsuit challenging Kraft's anti-takeover defenses, and in Glenview, Ill., Kraft didn't comment beyond its terse statement of Monday night that it wants to remain independent.    Wall Street handicappers quickly gave the upper hand to Philip Morris. &quot;An all-cash bid at an attractive price from a credible bidder is a potent combination,&quot; said Lang Reid, co-head of mergers and acquisitions at PaineWebber Group Inc., which isn't involved in the proposed transaction.    People close to Kraft said the company was caught off guard by the bid and is just beginning to consider its options. No board meeting has been scheduled, but a board response to the offer will be made by Oct. 31. The sources said no one has been authorized to seek other bids or investors in a possible leveraged buy-out.    One person close to Kraft discounted Wall Street speculation that Philip Morris has the upper hand, noting that arbitragers and other investors generally side with a suitor, at least initially.    Even if Kraft can elude the New York-based company's offer, investors and analysts said they expect Kraft to undergo a major restructuring of its ownership. &quot;It's hard for me to imagine the company just telling Philip Morris to go away and have the stock drop back to $60&quot; a share, where it was before the tender offer, said John Severance, director of stock investments for the Wisconsin Investment Board, a public employee pension fund that holds 2.3 million Kraft shares.    Kraft stock climbed a whopping $28.125 a share yesterday to close at $88.25 in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange.    While saying it wants a friendly merger, Philip Morris couldn't have adopted a more hostile opening strategy, takeover experts said. It didn't attempt any prior negotiations with Kraft before launching Monday night what what one arbitrager called a &quot;blitzkrieg.&quot;    In its suit, filed in federal court in Illinois, Philip Morris is seeking to prevent Kraft from invoking its anti-takeover defenses as a means of thwarting the offer. Kraft's board has adopted &quot;virtually every entrenchment device known to corporate America,&quot; Philip Morris alleged in its court filing. The filing also said Kraft had adopted last month so-called &quot;golden parachute&quot; contracts entitling senior and certain other executives to payments totaling more than $14.5 million if a third party acquires 20% or more of Kraft's stock. There was no response from Kraft yesterday.    Analysts, investors and arbitragers said yesterday's $88.25-a-share closing price represented the market's view that Kraft's shares are likely to be acquired by someone in the low- to mid-$90s.    Under Philip Morris's tender offer, shares won't actually be purchased by the company for 30 days. Takeover experts said the spread between the closing price of Kraft's shares and the $90-a-share offering price reflected the cost to arbitragers of holding the shares for a month. Arbitragers also said the spread reflected a bit of fear over betting on a deal of this size, and the fact that many arbitragers have invested in so many deals lately that they didn't have all the cash they needed to buy Kraft shares.    If completed, the merger will yield a $12 million windfall for Philip Morris's merger adviser, Wasserstein, Perella andamp; Co., the eight-month old firm started by the two former First Boston merger stars, Bruce Wasserstein and Joseph Perella. If the deal fails, a smaller fee will be negotiated, according to offering documents submitted by Philip Morris to the Securities and Exchange Commission.    In reaction to the proposed merger, major credit rating agencies placed the debt of both companies under review for possible downgrading, inasmuch as Philip Morris intends to finance most of the transaction with about $10 billion borrowed from banks. Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. said it was expecting Philip Morris to make some kind of acquisition, but that the Kraft bid was larger than anticipated.    &quot;Kraft could be downgraded if it pursues defensive measures which weaken the balance sheet or if lower-rated Philip Morris is successful in its takeover bid,&quot; Sandamp;P added.    In another legal move, a class action suit was filed yesterday on behalf of Kraft shareholders in a Cook County, Ill., court seeking to prevent Kraft's board from trying to halt a legitimate takeover attempt or a &quot;fair auction of Kraft.&quot; A Kraft spokesman declined to comment.    People close to the proposed deal said there was no contact between Kraft and Philip Morris yesterday. Some arbitragers and takeover professionals said they expect Kraft to file a lawsuit of its own against the tender offer as a way of buying time to think through its options.    An option for Kraft is to negotiate with Philip Morris for a higher price. Takeover professionals don't believe the suitor has put its best bid on the table. Philip Morris &quot;might have another $10 (a share) in their pocket, just in case,&quot; said one investment banker. Kraft could also reject the offer as inadequate, and take its chances that Philip Morris would go away.    Other options include seeking another bidder, offering Kraft shareholders a large cash dividend as part of a broad restructuring of ownership, or taking the company private through a leveraged buy-out. But any of those options would be difficult to achieve because of the enormous size of the transaction, takeover experts say.    The possibility of another suitor isn't strong because &quot;there aren't many companies that can come up with $11 billion,&quot; said Robert J. Cummins, an analyst at Wertheim Schroder andamp; Co.    Among those who could, but aren't considered likely to, are Nestle and Unilever. Philip Morris is believed to have more to gain strategically from a combination with Kraft than either of those companies.    Philip Morris and Kraft have no significant overlap of products, and Kraft has the strong international distribution system that Philip Morris' own food operation, General Foods, lacks. Kraft is worth $90 a share only to a company like Philip Morris, said one major arbitrager.    Doing a leveraged buy-out of Kraft would be an attractive proposition for investment bankers specializing in such transactions, namely the well-funded Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. The fees such a transaction would generate would be enormous, professionals say. A KKR spokesman declined comment.    But successful leveraged buy-outs of this size generally depend on two aspects that takeover professionals said were lacking in Kraft: a grossly mismanaged company where great cost-savings could be realized, and undervalued operating units that could be sold for much more than their currently perceived value.    Finally, Kraft could try a recapitalization, where shareholders would be offered a package possibly consisting of an upfront cash dividend, high-yielding junk bonds, and stock that would be worth much less than the current value. The theory would be that the entire package would be worth more than the $90 a share Philip Morris is offering.    But takeover professionals say such a restructuring would require Kraft, whose cash flow isn't as strong as Philip Morris's, to borrow a highly burdensome amount of money -- $12 billion by the estimate of people close to Philip Morris. What's more, only half of that sum would likely come from commercial banks. The other half would likely have to come from a potentially risky &quot;bridge loan&quot; from a Wall Street house.    ---   James A.
