The bill included trade benefits to the Soviets andEastern Europeans approved by the Senate Banking Committeeearlier this summer.</LP><TEXT>   The bill would effectively give the Pentagon the right toreview shipments of certain sensitive goods to certainnations. The Pentagon doesn't have the authority to screenexports sent to non-Communist nations.   The House has passed a reauthorization bill somewhat moregenerous to U.S. high-technology exporters than the Senateversion.   The Senate bill, which would renew the ExportAdministration Act for two years, also would empower the U.S.to impose trade sanctions on nations and companies thatviolate international prohibitions on chemical warfare. Thecurrent export law expires Sept. 30.   A provision by Sen. Richard Shelby (D., Ala.) wouldincrease penalties for violations of the trade embargoagainst Iraq and Iraqi-occupied Kuwait. The civil fine wouldbe raised to $250,000 from $10,000, and the criminal fine to$1 million from $50,000.   The Senate also adopted an amendment by Sen. William Roth(R., Del.) that would deter the State Department fromarbitrarily adding goods that are no longer controlled onnational-security grounds to its own munitions list.Exporters have complained that the list is too restrictive.</TEXT></DOC>
