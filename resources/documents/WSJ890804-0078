His major objection is to the bill's provision putting the bailout's costs on budget, where it can be used as a rhetorical trampoline by people jumping up and down for a tax increase. This bill ought to be vetoed, but there are other good reasons for doing so.    The bill not only fails to address the underlying causes of the Sandamp;L mess, but also it provides political cover for key Members who intervened with federal regulators to go easy on high-flying thrifts that since have crashed.    Last week, California Senator Alan Cranston, the second-ranking Senate Democrat, provided the decisive conference vote that will allow the top federal Sandamp;L regulator, M. Danny Wall, to continue in his job without reconfirmation by the Senate.    At any new confirmation hearings, Mr. Wall surely would have faced questions about his role in delaying regulatory action against Lincoln Savings andamp; Loan Association of Irvine, Calif., which since has failed and will wind up costing taxpayers $2.5 billion. Such questions also would have been very uncomfortable for Senator Cranston and four other senators -- John Glenn, Dennis DeConcini, Donald Riegle and John McCain -- who joined him in accepting large contributions from Lincoln's owner, Charles Keating, and then intervened with regulators on Lincoln's behalf. Ed Gray, former head of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, says the Senators asked him in April 1987 to drop a key regulation opposed by Mr. Keating -- &quot;a clear subversion of the regulatory process.&quot;    Now it turns out that at least two of the five Senators -- Messrs. Cranston and Glenn-are far more indebted to Mr. Keating than was known previously. Mr. Cranston solicited $850,000 from Mr. Keating for three voter-registration groups. Such groups are billed as nonpartisan, but they tend to largely register Democrats. Registration efforts are credited by Senator Cranston for his narrow 1986 re-election victory.    The San Francisco Chronicle reports that Senator Cranston was so eager to raise money for the groups that &quot;he didn't just hose people down, he used a water cannon.&quot; He refuses to release the names of other contributors he solicited money from.    Curiously, one of the groups was founded by Senator Cranston's son, and its chairman is a former judge whose law firm represents Keating business interests and is a co-defendant in a class-action suit filed against Lincoln's parent company. California Assemblyman Pat Johnston, a Democrat, plans to hold hearings on the issue later this month.    For his part, Senator Glenn solicited $200,000 in contributions from Mr. Keating for his National Council on Public Policy, a group that paid for Mr. Glenn to travel around the country and expound his views. The council raised a total of only $16,000 from other sources, with the Keating $200,000 contribution arranged by a former Glenn staffer who had become Mr. Keating's corporate counsel. The Cleveland Plain Dealer reports $43,800 of the Keating money was used to pay expenses of the Glenn Senate campaign -- a possible violation of federal law.    These revelations have angered lawyers for the 23,000 Lincoln customers who hold some $255 million in subordinated debentures - -unsecured, high-risk bonds -- that were sold by Lincoln's parent company, American Continental. They became nearly worthless when American Continental filed for bankruptcy, putting the bondholders in back of a long line of creditors. In class-action suits filed against Lincoln, lawyers for the bondholders plan to focus attention on the actions of Senator Cranston and his colleagues.    Lincoln wasn't closed by regulators until April 1989. Had it been shut down as had been suggested in 1987, taxpayers would have saved more than $1 billion and all but $3 million of the $255 million in subordinated debentures would not have been sold.    Senator Cranston has performed some elaborate gymnastics to deflect attention from his Lincoln lobbying. Having avoided a messy reconfirmation for Mr. Wall, he now is working to have the federal government bail out the Lincoln bondholders as if they were covered by deposit insurance. That would end the class-action suits that might turn up further details of his ties to Mr. Keating.    Whatever the outcome of the bailout bill itself, President Bush ought to insist that Congress not sweep aside the role that public officials and Members of Congress from Jim Wright, Tony Coelho and Alan Cranston on down played in creating the crisis. The Sandamp;L bailout is going to cost every taxpayer at least $1,500. The least they should get in return is a complete explanation of how their pockets were picked. </TEXT></DOC>
