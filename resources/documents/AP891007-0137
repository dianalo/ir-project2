In East Berlin late Saturday about 300 troopers moved in toguard the Communist Party's Central Committee headquarters.   The demonstrations were the most widespread display ofopposition to the hard-line Communist policies of the East Germanleadership in years and came on the country's 40th anniversary.More than 10,000 people are believed to have participated in theprotests in the four cities.   Scores of people were arrested and dozens injured by police whopunched, kicked and dragged away protesters and beat many withtruncheons, according to the reports. There were no officialreports on the number of arrests or injured. Three Westernjournalists were reportedly detained.   About 5,000 people held a pro-reform demonstration at EastBerlin's Alexanderplatz square at the end of a visit by SovietPresident Mikhail S. Gorbachev, a guest of honor during theanniversary celebrations.   Many East Germans want their hard-line leaders to adopt thekinds of democratic reforms undertaken by Gorbachev in the SovietUnion.   The demonstrators shouted ``Gorby, Gorby, help us!'' and tauntedthe police with calls of ``You people are afraid but we're not.''   Passing the state-owned ADN news agency office, protesterschanted ``Liar. Liar'' and ``Press freedom, press freedom.''   One man's head was smashed against the wall of an East Berlinapartment building when police were breaking up that demonstration.   Others were kicked by security police, dragged along the groundto side streets and hauled away, according to witnesses. SomeWestern news photographers also were beaten by police who struck attheir cameras.   Many East Berlin residents watched the melee from theirapartment windows above the street, waving sparklers to show theirsupport for the demonstrators.   Late Saturday an estimated 5,000 people converged in and aroundan East Berlin church to demand the release of political prisoners.   Security forces used clubs to disperse them, reported WestGerman ZDF television, but witnesses contradicted that report. Theysaid the demonstrators departed in small groups after they werepromised safe passage through the heavy police presence.   Catherine Field, a reporter for the British newspaper Observer,said East German authorities arrested three media colleagues at thechurch demonstration. She identified them as Peter Millar of theSunday Times of London, Igor Reichlin of the AP-Dow Jones newsagency and Gary Matsumoto of NBC Radio Network News. There was noimmediate confirmation by authorities.   Police units sealed off an area where people were streaming towatch fireworks marking the anniversary in a move to preventanother mass gathering.   The East Berlin protests were the biggest in the East Germancapital since a 1953 workers' uprising. Witnesses said at least 100people were arrested.   West Germany's ARD television network said security forces alsoused violence to break up a protest march by ``several hundredpeople'' in Potsdam, just outside Berlin.   Violence erupted in Leipzig after about 4,000 people gatheredfor a pro-reform demonstration in front of the city's Nikolaichurch, witnesses reported.   They said police, wearing riot helmets and carrying shields,waded into the crowd of protesters and began beating them.   The demonstrators offered no resistance but shouted ``Noviolence,'' ``Shame on you,'' and ``Gorbachev, Gorbachev!'' thewitnesses said.   ``Dozens of people were taken into custody,'' said one witness.   In Dresden, about 2,000 demonstrators battled police overnightand many people were injured, according to witnesses. The number ofinjuries was not immediately known.   A chain of hundreds of officers attacked the demonstrators, whoresponded by hurling bottles and other objects, witnesses said.   The street battles lasted for several hours, said the witnesses,who spoke on condition of anonymity. It was the fourth straightnight of violence in Dresden.   In Berlin, East German authorities barred Western tourists fromthe city's Communist eastern sector for a third day.   ``East Germany apparently fears that regime critics coming fromWest Berlin could disturb the 40th anniversary celebrations,'' saidWest Germany's ARD television.   On the east side of Checkpoint Charlie, the government earlySaturday erected 2-yard-high steel and concrete barriers along thedividing marker between the sectors.   A man from West Berlin with a crowbar hacked and hammered at themetal part of the barriers, tearing down one section. He was laterpulled back by West Berlin police.   About 15 East German border guards stood by as a crowd of about200 taunted them from the Western side.</TEXT></DOC>
