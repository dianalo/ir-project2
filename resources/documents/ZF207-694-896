 This year, when we sat down to prepare the backgroundmaterial for the Computer Publishing Conference, we decided that it would beuseful to try to identify and articulate what we think are the essentialreatities of thc ongoing computer publishing revolution.andM;We decided to write something we would like to share with our wider audienceof readers as well as with the Conference attendees.andP;  Whether or not youagree with us, we think you will find the exercise interesting.andM;A Seybold ManifestoandM;We arc fond of saying that the computer publishing industry is in the midstof a revolution, and that revolutions are generally pretty messy.andP;  Notsurprisingly, an awful lot of what is happening in the industry these days ischaotic and confusing.andP;  This is exactly what makes it such an exciting time.andO;Everything is changing at once.andP;  Everything is so interrelated.andP;  So many ofthe decisions that shape the future hinge not on technical issues but onpersonalities, egos, competing commercial interests and happenstance.andP;  Justwhen you think something is settled, along comes something new that changesthe picture completely.andM;Despite this changing picture, we think that there are clear and consistentunderlying trends.andP;  Most of the time, we deal with them almost on asubconscious level.andP;  The shared, halfarticulated understanding about keymarket realities is part of the &quot;world view' that is reflected in ourcomments, observations and analyses of events.andM;Once in a while, it is useful to drag some of these assumptions out into thelight of day for everyone to see.andP;  It helps us, our readers and ourconference attendees to be clear about what we think is happening.andP;  We hopethat it will also help you to articulate your own assumptions and to identifywhere your views differ from ours.andM;To make things manageable, we have stated some of our assumptions and beliefsin the form of ten premises.andP;  The number is completely arbitrary.andP;  There areat least a half dozen more that come to mind, but we had to stop someplace.andO;The sequence is also somewhat arbitrary.andP;  There is no implication, therefore,that Premise #2 is more important than Premises #4 or #8.andM;None of these premises is likely to seem new or startling to regular readersof this Report.andP;  After aB, the whole point of the exercise is tore-articulate assumptions that have been there all along.andP;  Nevertheless, whenyou set out to state some of your assumptions as bald premises, interestingimplications pop out.andM;Here are our premises.andP;  See what you think.andM;1.andP;  Dfformation in electronic formandM;We are well on our way along an evolution into an entirely new environment:one in which gathering, organizing, analyzing, formatting, presenting andcommucating information between and among the individuals and organizationsinvolved in the publishing process is done electronically.andP;  This is anabsolutely fundamental shift that has very far-reaching implications.andM;Electronic distribution.andP;  One of the implications, of course, is that puttingmarks on paper is only one way of &quot;publishing'-making public-the informationthat is stored in the computer.andP;  Depending on the requirements, informationmay be published on paper.andP;  It may be presented on slides or on a videoscreen.andP;  It may be published in an interactive database stored in a computeror distributed on CD-ROMS.andP;  It may include not only text, graphics and stiffimages, but also sound, animation and motion images.andP;  It may be accessed viaa variety of means, including through interactive hypermedia links on acomputer database or through an &quot;agene, program that analyzes information forthe user and selects the documents or portions of documents that it has beentaught are likely to be of interest.andM;Documents may be published in several forms.andP;  Even those that are primarilypaper-based may also be available in alternative forms.andP;  The material that isnow prepared for a printed mail order catalog might be stored online (so thatorder-takers or stock clerks can call up and view the same catalog page thecustomer sees).andP;  The printed catalog could also be supplemented by a CD-ROMversion with voice descriptions, visual effects, electronic order forms anddial-up order filfillment.andM;We believe that paper will remain the preferred method of distributinginformation for a long time.andP;  Paper documents are inexpensive, compact andportable, can render high-quality images, and are easy to access or peruse ina non-sequential fashion.andP;  However, in general, even for documentsdistributed exclusively on paper, the objective will be to prepare thedocument within the computer systems and convert it onto paper as late in theprocess as possible, and as close to die user as possible.andP;  The idealdelivery vehicle for the Seybold Report's, for example, would probably beultra-high- resolution facsimile delivered directly to our subscribers'offices-or, perhaps even better, a high-rcsolution screen display with theoption of high-quality output on paper at the reader's discretion.andM;Already, magazine and newspaper publishers are making increased use of remoteprinting plants so that they can image die publication on paper as close tothc reader as practical and so that they can tailor the publication asclosely as possible to the reader's interest.andP;  Other publishers are usingprinting and binding facilities that permit a high degree of demographictailoring in assembling the publication.andP;  Electronic communication.andP;  None ofthis is news to most people in the publishing industry.andP;  But what many fewerpeople have focused on is the really fundamental change taking placeupstream&quot; of the distribution process.andM;Simply put, tbe communication of information between individuals and betweenorganization involved in tbe publishing process will increasingly occur inelectronic form.andP;  Writers and illustrators submit text and graphics for acompany newsletter in electronic form.andP;  Authors submit book manuscripts inelectronic form.andP;  Advertisers will want to submit completed ads to newspapersand magazines in press- and format-independent electronic form.andP;  Under theCALs (COmputer-aided Acquisition and Logistic Support) initiative, Departmentof Defense contractors will submit documentation in electronic form ratherthan on paper.andM;An ever-larger proportion of this exchange of information wiU take placebetween departments and between organizations: between graphic designers andprepress production houses, between magarine or catalog publishers and theirprinters, between subcontractors and prime contractors, between advertisersand publishers.andM;All of this means that the publishing process is increasingly rooted inelectronic information processing, and that publishers are increasinglydependent upon tools, techniques and standards developed by thc computerindustry.andM;2.andP;  The desktop market drives standardsandM;Cal Bauer of Bauer Enterprises (now a part of Microsoft) caused a furor whenhe stated at thc Seybold Seminars last March that publishing standards aredriven from thc desktop market.andP;  A number of the attendees took the troubleto tell us that it was the dumbest comment they had ever heard.andP;  Wc told themthat we largely agreed with Bauer's statement.andM;The real question is: Who has the power to set standards? The answer, webelieve, is that it is the people who ship lots of product.andP;  Desktopcomputers, desktop networks and laser printers constitute the sea that evenhigh-end publishing applications must swim in.andP;  Like it or not, the importantstandards are set by the environment.andP;  The computer operating environments,networking capabilities, page description languages and font technologicsthat we discuss in these conferences are fundamental technology for the nextgeneration of publishing.andM;3.andP;  Heterogeneous computing environmentsandM;This brings us to our next point: it is going to be increasingly rare, webelieve, for publishing to take place within a single, homogeneous computingenvironment.andP;  There will probably always be all-Macintosh shops, aB-EBMshops, all-DEC shops, etc., but the trend is clearly away from thisdirection.andM;More and more, the reality for users is a mixed Mac/PC/ Unix installed base.andO;This likelihood becomes almost a certainty when you start worrying aboutcommunicating information between different organizations, In mostsituations, it is impractical to assume that everyone involved in thepublishing process is using the same kind of computer.andM;Naturally, this means that users want and need the ability to exchangeinformation among all these computers.andP;  But as we progress, we may no longerbe talking about passing simple ASCII text files.andP;  We wiU want to exchange 3Drendered ifnages, charts and graphs that include rotated text, formattedpages of text and graphics, and full-color, high-rcsolution images.andP;  Wc maysimply want to drive the same output device from a variety of computers.andM;This evolution poses a real dilemma.andP;  The computing industry has finallybegun to build into its products the kind of sophistication required forpublishing (see point #6, below).andP;  Developers arc struggling to integrate therequired facilities into their respective operating environments.andP;  To whatextent wiU insisting on portability of information among computer systemsforce us back to much more primitive, &quot;least common denominator&quot; standards?andM;4.andP;  Control by the 'originator'andM;Until recently, publishing technology had forced a clear separation betweenthe creative people who specified work and the craft specialist whoimplemented these specifications.andP;  This separation produces a convoluted,time-consuming and expensive process.andP;  The creative person, or &quot;originator,&quot;specifies what is to be done; the craftsperson, using special equipment,carries out the orders.andP;  The craftsperson may make mistakes, or theoriginator may decide after seeing thc results that he or she does not likethem.andP;  A cycle of proofs and corrections is born.andM;Now, incrcasingly, the originator deals direcdy with the computer system thatimplements (usually instantaneously) what he or she tells it to do.andP;  In thesimplest case, a single person has complete responsibility for producing adocument.andP;  More often, multiple people are involved.andP;  Publishing is usually agroup or collective activity teaming people with different responsibilitiesand different areas of expertise: text creation, text editing, graphics,composition and page make-up, and so forth.andM;The new technology enables each person or group to take direct control ofhis, her or its portions of the overaB task.andP;  We can (and should) rethink theentire publishing process and restructure it to take best advantage of theopportunities opened up by this new technology.andP;  We must develop neworganizational structures and relationships.andP;  Who should do what? Who has theskills, the experience and the tools required to perform a given task? Is thebest use of a creative person's time to have him or her making craftdecisions? How should people communicate?andM;We also need new computer- based tools for managing the publishing process.andO;This is clearly the most significant unmet need in desktop publishingsystems.andM;5.andP;  Rich graphic communicationandM;This point probably does not need much elaboration.andP;  In general, we think itis dear that, across the board, as better tools become available, more peopleare using more graphics to communicate information.andP;  This observation extendsto dramatic increases in the use of type and typography, graphics and graphiceffects, and, of course, color.andM;We see no sign that this trend is abating, or that it is a fad.andP;  In fact,looking at what we can anticipate in the way of new tools and capabilities inthe coming years, we think that we are still in the early stages of thisphenomenon.andP;  Since thc tools wiU be so widely available, the increasedfreedom wiU almost certainly bring the expected proportion of aesthetictravesties.andM;6.andP;  Publiishing, inseparable from computingandM;We have already contended that (depending upon your application) publishingeither has become or is becoming completely rooted in electronic informationprocessing.andP;  But the converse is also happening.andM;As the computer industry evolves from its data processing roots towards afocus on gathering, organizing, analyzing, formatting and co m municatinginformation, it homes in on performing exactly the same tasks we said (initem # 1, above) that publishers do.andM;&quot;Office- vs.andP;  &quot;publishing.&quot; One by one, the major computer companies havecome to realize&quot;publishing&quot; and &quot;office&quot; users do not belong to two differentmarkets, but actually represent different points along a single continuum.andO;We treated them as separate markets in the past because the technology forcedus to.andP;  Users had a choice: professionally typeset documents thatcommunicated information more effectively and more authoritatively (at theexpense of long turnaround times, loss of control and high cost), orlow-quality typewritten documents produced in the office (low cost, fastturnaround and control at the expense of effective communication, authorityand prestige).andP;  But if you look at the world from the standpoint of userneeds, it is clear that this distinction is entirely artificial.andP;  In reality,the documents pcople would like to producespan a wide range from simpleoffice memos to the most demanding printed material.andM;With today's technology, the office user and the publishing user representdifferent points along this continuum.andP;  Increasingly, they use the samecomputers.andP;  They may, at different times, be the same person.andP;  They willfrequently need to exchange information.andP;  More important, as technology opensup new possibilities, the office user's expectations are shooting upward.andO;Word processor and spreadsheet users are demanding access to a variety oftype fonts and sizes and increasingly sophisticated graphics for the samereasons that publishers have demanded them: they help communicate informationmore effectively.andM;The office user probably does not know what goes into producingprofessional-looking pages, but he has been looking at them all his life, andhe knows quality when he sees it.andP;  He will not be satisfied for long with aspreadsheet heading set in 48-point Helvetica with excessive letterspacing.andO;He may prefer Palatino, he will certainly prefer to see it properly kerned,and he will definitely want access to a rich set of characters and symbols.andM;Leading-edge application.andP;  In short, the computer industry is coming torealize that publishers no longer represent a special case.andP;  &quot;Publishers&quot; arethe professional communicators.andP;  They are the ones pushing the computingenvelope.andP;  What they want now, the rest of the market wiU expect in a fewyears.andM;So publishing becomes the test case.andP;  Publishers are also the early adopters,and therefore they are a key market for the latest computer technology.andP;  Lessdemanding office users may not know why they need the latest, most powerfullgraphic computer.andP;  Users at the publishing end of the spectrum generally haveno such questions.andP;  They are ready and eager for as much power andsophistication as they can get.andM;7.andP;  Democratization of publishingandM;One of the key ingredients in the revolution is, of course, broaddistribution of the new generation of hardware and software.andP;  Thisdistribution has made tools available to everyone from casual user tofull-time professional, from a South African dissident on a shoestring budgetto the creative director of an advertising agency.andM;Moreover, an extraordinary number of these people are using the same tools.andO;The same desktop publishing program used to produce the departmentalnewsletter might also be used to lay out pages, compose text and size andplace pictures for a high-quality color catalog.andM;Three key elements have created this phenomenon:andM;* Low cost.andP;  Mass-market pricing for hardware and softwareandM;has made publishing solutions affordable.andP;  This is important not just for thesmall entrepreneur on a tiny budget, but also for a workgroup or departmentwithin a large organization.andP;  Inexpensive solutions do not require the kindof rigid costjustification needed for the previous generation of publishingsystems.andM;* Availability.andP;  Almost as important as low prices is wideandM;availability.andP;  PCs and Macs are available through computer dealers in eventhe smallest cities.andP;  Unix workstations are sold through more specializedchannels, but they still have far broader and more diverse distribution thandid the previous generation of dedicated publishing systems.andM;* Accusibility.andP;  Some 18 years ago, the Compugraphic ComandM;puWriter ushered in an era of low-cost (under $10,000) typesetting systems.andO;These substantially broadened the typesetting market, but they did not haveanything like the impact of the more recent desktop publishing systems.andO;There are two reasons for this smaller impact.andP;  The first is that theCompuWriter et al.andP;  were typesetting systems: they produced galleys of type,not complete pages.andP;  Second-and far more important-these machines wereintended for use by a specially trained craftsperson.andP;  They required athorough knowledge of typesetting commands and conventions as well asequipment to process the photographic paper exposed in die typesettingmachine.andM;By contrast, one of the key aspects of the succcssful desktop publishingproducts is that they made publishing available to a much widcr audience.andM;The virtue of this accessibility is now apparent to everyone.andP;  If yourobjective is to give the originator control of the process, you had betterbuild a product that is simple enough that he or she is willing to learn touse it.andM;Naturally, there is tension between the continual pressure to add capabilityand sophistication to products and the desire to keep them accessible enoughto have broad appeal.andM;8.andP;  Building and supporting systemsandM;If you think about it, the situation we have described thus far creates a fewnasty problems.andP;  We have described a world dominated by mass-market hardwareand software that, to be successful in thc market, must appeal to largenumbers of potential users.andP;  But professional users large and small may needmore.andM;They may need more capabilities or more sophistication than can be reconciledwith &quot;accessibility&quot; demanded by the mass market.andP;  They may need higherthroughput and/or better quality.andP;  They may need to integrate more types ofinformation from a greater variety of sources.andP;  They will almost certainlyneed tools to manage and control the publishing process.andM;In short, at some point you must assemble a publishing system.andP;  This may be amatter of networking computers and selecting a suite of software packages.andO;But it may involve considerably more.andP;  It may make sense to add software thatis better suited to the task at hand.andP;  You may even want specialized hardwarethat offers substantial performance or productivity advantages.andM;Who builds the system? Most small users, and a small but increasing number ofmedium to large users, arc tackling the system integration task themselves.andO;Some prefer to have this control.andP;  Others feel they have no choice.andP;  But itis clear that a great number of users do not want to be in the systemintegration business.andP;  They would rather have someone else build the systemfor them.andM;The dilemma is that system integration is a lot more difficult-and a lot moreexpensive-than many users appreciate.andP;  The applications that attract systcmdevelopers tend to be those in which there are a sizable number of(preferably large) users who share similar application needs, and who regarda publishing system as so important to their business that they are willingto pay whatever it takes to get one.andM;This situation describes such users as large newspapers and magazines, colortrade shops and color printers, and documentation users who face stringentrequirements (such as the need for CALS COMpliance).andP;  It does not describemany smaller users, or users who, the vendors fear, can probably assemblewhat they need from pieces they can buy from the local computer store and whoare not willing to pay a substantial premium to have this done for them.andM;As we have been pointing out repeatedly for the past four or five years, wethink that the computer industry's biggest challenge is figuring out how todeliver application solutions to customers who want them.andP;  We are not certainanyone has really figured this out yet.andM;We ourselves have the sneaking suspicion that the answer, such as it is, maylie not with any single course of action, but rather with the cumulativeeffect of a lot of partial answers: carefully crafted operating environmentsthat support &quot;plug and play&quot; system configuration, rigorously consistentgraphic user interfaces, a great deal of attention paid by applicationsoftware developers to logical consistency and ease of operation, extensiveuse of standards that allow programs to work together and to exchange data ina transparent fashion, online &quot;help&quot; and support facilities, a growingsupport infrastructure that includes vendor hotlines, formal and informaluser groups, books, magazines, training classes, consultants, andbuddy-tobuddy assistance, and small and large system integrators andvalue-added dealers who focus on understanding and serving particularapplications.andM;9.andP;  A digital worldandM;The electronic communication we talked about back in Premise # 1 is madepossible by the fact that we are increasingly able to convert informationinto digital form that can be stored and manipulated on a computer.andP;  We aBknow about text, graphics and images.andP;  Sound has also moved into the digitalworld (samplers, synthesizers, compact discs and digital audio tapes).andO;Animation and video are now moving in the same direction.andP;  Taste, smell andtactile sensations have yet to be conquered.andM;This does not mean that it always makes economic sense to put something intodigital form -ask someone who just spent 40 minutes playing out on aLinotronic a halftone that he could have stripped into place on the page for$10.andP;  However, we are all aware that the economic thresholds are beinglowered month by month, year by year.andP;  (See, for example, the report on theEFI compression scheme for color images on page 27 of this issue.)andM;Multimedia collision.andP;  One of the consequences of this movement is aninevitable collision between the computer/ publishing world and thcaudio/video entertaimnent world.andP;  We have already suggested that documentsmay include digitized sound and motion video.andP;  Where wiU the lines be drawn?andO;Are not sound and video effective new ways of communicating information thatshould be used when appropriate?andM;We think so.andM;10.andP;  Foundation for the futureandM;We believe that the computer/publishing industry is now going through aperiod of dramatic change.andP;  Wc are nearing the end of the PC era andestablishing die foundation for a new generation of computing based onpowerful desktop computers, sophisticated multitasking operating systems,networking, graphic operating environments, interoperability amongapplication programs, and rich use of text, graphics, images and sound.andM;It is in this period of transition from one generation to the next that theshape of the next generation is established.andP;  The major companies arebattling fiercely to determine who wiU drive the market.andP;  The decisions beingmade now and the market positions being established now will be hard tochange in the years to come-which is precisely why these decisions are soimportant to all of us.andM;As we said at the outset, this is what makes these &quot;the best of times and theworst of times&quot; for all of us caught up in the revolution.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
