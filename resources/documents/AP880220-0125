Payload Systems Inc. of Wellsley, Mass., received a two-yearlicense from the Commerce Department earlier this month to contractwith the Soviet space agency to perform protein crystallizationexperiments aboard the Soviet space station Mir, said Mark S.McConnell, a Washington attorney who handled the company'snegotiations with the Commerce and Defense departments.   The company, a consulting firm, was founded in 1984 by Byron K.Lichtenberg of the Massachussetts Institute of Technology. He wasthe first American non-astronaut to fly aboard the space shuttle inDecember 1983.   The experiment will use the weightlessness of space to growlarge, regular protein crystals, which are useful in thedevelopment of new drugs, McConnell said Saturday evening.   ``To my knowledge, it is the first time that the U.S. governmenthas approved commercial activity in the Soviet space program.Certainly we've had joint missions, government-to-government,'' hesaid.   Since the explosion of the Challenger space shuttle in January1986, American companies have been left with few alternatives forspace projects.   ``Even when the shuttle was flying it provided only a limitedamount of time in space. With the shuttle down, the only Americanoption is (a plane) flown in a parabolic flight path that givesonly a few minutes of weightlessness,'' McConnell said.   U.S. officials were concerned about the possibility oftransferring sensitive technology to the Soviet Union, butMcConnell said, ``We created a situation that absolutely minimizedthat.'' He said the Commerce Department issued the license aftergetting from the Pentagon.   ``There will be extremely limited training given to thecosmonauts. They will be doing no more than turning some dials on abox, the contents of which they will not know about, and monitoringenvironmental conditions in the space station,'' he said.   He said the Soviets were satisfied with the arrangement, adding,``Their goal from what I could tell is to promote commercial usesworldwide of their station.''   The U.S. government has been reluctant to permit Americancompanies to hire the Soviets to launch satellites and McConnellsaid the Soviets viewed the crystallization project as their bestshot at working with a U.S. firm.   He said Payload Systems has reached an agreement in principlewith the Soviets, but still was negotiating over details.   He said the company would not attempt to sell the crystals grownin the first flight.   ``They're just trying to see if it works for commercialpurposes,'' he said.   According to The New York Times, which carried a story on theproject in Sunday's editions, the first flight will be sometimenext year.   The newspaper said Payload Systems refused to discuss the termsof the contract. It added, however, that the Soviets in the pasthave offered to carry Western experiments for between $10,000 and$15,000 a kilogram.   Calls to company officials seeking comment were not immediatelyreturned Saturday night.   President Reagan's budget, released Thursday, provides $1billion to build a U.S. space station by the mid-1990s. Earlierthis month Reagan unveiled a national policy for commercialactivity in space. It provides for the government to lease spaceaboard a space module that will be carried aloft by the spaceshuttle and left in orbit.</TEXT></DOC>
