The pattern is expected to be repeated by other large oilcompanies. &quot;The trend in the quarter is lousy,&quot; said BernardPicchi, an oil analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc. in NewYork. The firm estimates that 19 large oil companies willpost an overall drop of 18% in profits.</LP><TEXT>   Oil companies are expected to report declines in almostall their operations. The recession has reduced profitmargins for gasoline refining and marketing. On the WestCoast, where Arco operates and Amoco doesn't, ferocious pricewars and a glut have reduced profitability even more.Chemical profits also declined, and depressed natural gasprices hurt both companies.   The only bright spot for the industry was the price ofcrude, which was $2 to $3 a barrel higher than a yearearlier.   Amoco, based in Chicago, said net income fell to $238million, or 48 cents a share, from $379 million, or 75 centsa share, the year before. In the latest quarter Amoco had $68million of charges related to the restructuring of Canadianoperations and asset write-downs in its chemical business.Without the charges, operating profit fell 17%. Revenue fell9.3% to $6.74 billion from $7.44 billion.   Arco, based in Los Angeles, said net fell to $246 million,or $1.51 a share, in the second quarter from $391 million, or$2.36 a share. Sales rose 5% to $4.24 billion from $4.04billion.   Results for Amoco and Arco were in the range of WallStreet expectations. Amoco shares rose 37.5 cents to $53.375and Arco fell $1.50 to $123.125, in late trading on the NewYork Stock Exchange.   For both companies, refining and marketing wasparticularly weak. &quot;Margins in 1991 have fallen from 1990,reflecting higher crude oil prices and lower U.S. industrygasoline demand,&quot; said H. Laurance Fuller, chairman of Amoco.Higher oil prices reduce refining profit margins becausecrude is the feedstock for gasoline. Amoco's operating profitfor refining and marketing fell 28% to $227 million.   Arco's refining and marketing profit fell 51% to $85million from a record $175 million. Excluding a favorable $37million tax adjustment in the latest quarter, profit wouldhave fallen 73%. Arco sells gasoline exclusively on the WestCoast, but weakness in that market is also expected to dragdown overall earnings of two other large West Coast refinersthat sell elsewhere, Chevron Corp. and Unocal Corp.</TEXT></DOC>
