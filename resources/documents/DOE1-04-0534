The information obtainedby this examination concerning cerebral perfusion is usually edged visually.In 50 patients a time density curve at a specific point was analysedusing 128x128 matrix. The level of grey scale at the moment of arrivalof the bolus permits estimation of the haemodynamics of the intracranialvessels and provides a simple demonstration of differences of perfusion.</TEXT></DOC>
