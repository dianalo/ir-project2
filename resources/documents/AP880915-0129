(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   For those who have ever stuffed somethingdown a suggestion box and thought it might as well have been a rathole, take heart.   Or take Edward A. Anderson, for example.   Anderson, 51, of Yorba Linda, Calif., has been named ``Suggesterof the Year'' for submitting nine little gems that were adopted byhis company and resulted in cost-savings improvements totaling $22million in 1987.   The suggestions were not only lucrative to Anderson's employer,Hughes Aircraft Co., but they put extra money into his pockets aswell. And patents have been awarded on five of Anderson's ideasimproving on methods of assembling communications satellites.   The company program does not provide for direct financialrewards, but ``there's a direct relationship between yoursuggestions and your salary raises,'' says Anderson.   ``I'm motivated by a desire for recognition by the management.When you come up with a really good idea, you know you didsomething important. It's my way of keeping on top of the Christmastree.''   One of his suggestions saved about 15,000 hours of labor.Another lightened the weight of satellites, cutting down on launchcosts.   Anderson, a senior scientist in the materials and processlaboratory of Hughes' Space and Communications Group, is acompulsive suggester.   In 14 years, he submitted 200 ideas. Of these, his bosses say,100 were adopted, providing cost savings totaling $75 million.   Anderson's selection was announced in Orlando at the annualconference of the National Association of Suggestion Systems, whichincludes administrators of suggestion systems for 900 membercompanies with a combined total of 13 million employees throughoutthe country.   Runner-up to Anderson was Richard Makaiwi, who recommended theuse of a penuematic underground piercing tool for installation ofnatural gas services to customers of Pacific Gas andamp; Electric Co. ofSan Jose, Calif.   The suggestion will provide an estimated savings of more than $1million in each of the next five years and enriched Makaiwi's bankaccount by $25,000.   Finishing third in the annual competition was Rickey D. Tison,who works for the Air Force at Tinker Air Force Base in OklahomaCity. His idea led to the development of a machine part used in therepair of the engine afterburner of an F-111 jet fighter. Thesuggestion also earned Tison $25,000.   NASS officials said the Air Force suggestion program saved arecord $309 million in fiscal 1987.   Member companies reported savings of more than $2 billion in1987 as a result of their employees' suggestion programs, NASSsaid. Employees received a total of $150 million in award paymentsfor suggestions adopted.   The oldest employee suggestion program in this country was setup in 1898 by the Eastman Kodak Co. and is still in operation.Shortly after that, General Electric, Westinghouse, MetropolitanLife Insurance, Parke Davis Pharmaceuticals and others set upsystems.   After World War II, a federal law allowed widespreadestablishment of such programs in federal, state and localgovernment agencies.   And, to emphasize that somebody actually reads, and counts, allthe tips, ideas and comments, NASS member companies reported thatthey received 1,023,421 suggestions last year _ 13 suggestions fromevery 100 eligible employees.   Of these, 247,920 were adopted.</TEXT></DOC>
