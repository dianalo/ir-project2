McCarthy (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> UT GTE </CO><IN> BIO TEL TNM </IN><TEXT>   William T. Esrey, president and chief executive officer of United Telecommunications Inc., has been betting the future of his company on long distance for four years now. On Monday, he upped the ante by an uncomfortable amount, some analysts say.    The 48-year-old Mr. Esrey, who worked for American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. in the mid-1960s and aspired to the president's job there, began propelling United Telecom four years ago toward building a national fiber-optics network. Later, he helped structure a 50-50 joint venture with GTE Corp., marrying United Telecom's fiber-optics network with the well-established customer base of US Sprint Communications Co., a GTE unit.    Just this week, he raised the stakes considerably, engineering a deal for United Telecom to take control of the money-losing Sprint venture.    Mr. Esrey said he believes most of the risks are history now. The bulk of a costly national fiber-optic network is in place, analysts are finally projecting a profit next year for the beleaguered long-distance operation, and company officials have said that widespread billing and service problems are under control.    Some analysts aren't so sure. &quot;I think he has definitely bet the company and his career on US Sprint,&quot; said James Stork, an analyst with Duff andamp; Phelps Inc., Chicago. &quot;And I'm not convinced there will be the big payoff.&quot;    He and other analysts worry about the partial defection of GTE; United Telecom will pay GTE about $600 million for an additional 30.1% stake in US Sprint, leaving GTE with 19.9%. &quot;The question with US Sprint is, how soon will it be profitable and how much,&quot; says Mr. Stork. &quot;For GTE, the answer seems to be not soon, and not enough.&quot;    The transaction already poses risks to United Telecom's credit ratings. Standard andamp; Poor's put the Kansas City, Mo.-based company and its units' securities on the CreditWatch list with negative implications, and Moody's Investors Service yesterday said it is reviewing the company's debt and may downgrade it.    Some analysts note that United Telecom's management, which is well-regarded for the way it operates regulated telephone utilities, hasn't yet proved it can operate a company profitably in the bitterly competitive long-distance market dominated by ATandamp;T. United Telecom, for example, is preparing to put a third manager in charge of US Sprint, which is only two years old.    Mr. Esrey believes that US Sprint will become profitable, although he won't say when the operation will emerge from the red. He is so intent in that belief that in late May he announced a $775 million sale of a big chunk of United Telecom -- its cellular telephone business -- which analysts say was to help buy a bigger stake in US Sprint. Mr. Esrey says, though, that the transactions were unrelated.    Mr. Esrey developed his vision for the company along with Chairman Paul Henson. The steadfastness of Mr. Esrey to that vision appeared to leave him at odds with GTE, analysts said. From the beginning, some outsiders viewed the US Sprint joint venture as a way for GTE to exit the longdistance business more quickly if it became impatient with unprofitability. But Mr. Esrey, who has a grand vision of slugging it out with MCI Communications Corp. and ATandamp;T, the industry's two biggest players, was taking the long view, analysts said.    Mr. Esrey's determination pervades other areas of his life. A fitness enthusiast, he likes to ski and pump iron. He tries to work out every day, and that's gotten a little easier since he built a fitness center at the company's headquarters 18 months ago. Said Jack Grubman, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc.: &quot;I don't think Sprint will ever be as lean and mean as Bill Esrey.&quot;    But Mr. Esrey doesn't want to leave the impression that he will cling steadfastly to a sinking ship. &quot;If I thought we couldn't meet our objectives, I'd say we can't, and turn back,&quot; he says. &quot;I just don't see that in the cards.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
