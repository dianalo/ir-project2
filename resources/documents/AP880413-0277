Aeromexico's 43 aircraft were grounded in airports in Mexico andabroad after unionized ground workers walked off their jobs at 2:00p.m. EDT, said Enrique Gutierrez Ortega, spokesman for the Aeronavede Mexico parent company.   Gutierrez Ortega estimated during a telephone interview thatrevenue losses would amount to more than $2 million for each day ofthe strike.   The strikers, members of the Aeromexico National TechnicalWorkers Union, were demanding a halt to company plans to sell 13aircraft and lay off an unspecified number of airline workers tocut operating losses.   Some 17,000 airline passengers had their flights cancelledbecause of the walkout, Gutierrez Ortega said.   ``The passengers most affected are those who had flights to NewYork and Paris'' and were unable to quickly arrange alternativeconnections, he said.   Union spokesman Rene Arce told The Associated Press the strikewould continue ``indefinitely as long as the company doesn't revokeits decision to sell the planes and terminate union workers.''   Aeromexico officials were appealing to the federal Conciliationand Arbitration Commission to declare the strike illegal, GutierrezOrtega said.   The government did not plan to take over the nation'ssecond-largest airline to keep it operating, the Communications andTransportation Department said in a statement released Tuesday.</TEXT></DOC>
