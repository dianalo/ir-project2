Around him on the dock, Spain's mixed emotions about themaneuver are clearly apparent. A chorus of protesters, 200strong, begins a rhythmic chant: &quot;Spanish soldiers are notfor war]&quot; Other bystanders climb surrounding walls and try todrown out the protests with cheers.</LP><TEXT>   Despite the popular ambivalence about whether to sendtroops to the Gulf, the Spanish government has left littledoubt about why it decided to do so. The nation's forces aregoing to the Middle East not for Spain, not for the U.S. andnot even for cheaper oil. Rather, Spain has justified themission -- its first major foreign military effort since theSpanish-American War nearly a century ago -- by maintainingthat it fulfills a commitment to a united Europe.   &quot;We're members of the {European} Community now,&quot; explainsMr. Romera-Rodriguez, wiping the sweat from his sunburnedforehead. &quot;We have to stand together.&quot;   To some, the EC's efforts in the Middle East show howEuropeans collectively can play a more visible political rolein global affairs, and not just a greater economic one.Pierre Champenois, head of the political-military affairsdepartment in the Belgian Foreign Ministry, asserts that &quot;aEuropean framework {for political and defense matters} istaking shape.&quot;   At the same time, however, the EC's response is alsohighlighting just how far the group's 12 member states stillhave to go if they are to achieve their oft-stated goal ofpolitical unification. &quot;Each country in Europe has reacted tothis crisis in ways that are typical for the way they havebehaved for the past 100 years or so,&quot; says Bill Cash,chairman of the British Parliament's backbench committee onEuropean affairs and an outspoken opponent of EC politicalunion. Placing self-interest above the interests of thegroup, he says, the EC nations have been &quot;absolutely true toform.&quot;   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, too, has arguedthat the crisis shows how talk about a common security policyas part of EC political union is little more than &quot;rhetoric.&quot;Only France and Britain have done more than the bare minimum,she said, adding, &quot;It is sad that, at this critical time,Europe has not fully measured up to expectations.&quot;   Speaking on behalf of the EC's Council of Ministers, overwhich Italy is presiding for the rest of the year, ItalianForeign Minister Gianni De Michelis called Mrs. Thatcher'sremarks &quot;unjustified and ungenerous&quot; and insisted that the EChas acted &quot;effectively and with clarity of intentions anddecisions.&quot; While he said that the EC wouldn't as a grouprespond positively to President Bush's request for help inpaying for U.S. forces in the Gulf, he noted that thecommunity could assume a larger role in aiding such nationsas Turkey, Jordan and Egypt, which have been hit hardeconomically by the crisis.   In many ways, progress on the post-1992 single market andthe coming talks about a more unified political structure andsingle EC currency have raised public expectations far beyondthe community's ability to deliver. The EC's 12 small armiesare still designed more to protect their countries from oneanother or from the Soviets than to project Europe'scollective power and influence in the world. And even thoughthe EC has stepped up efforts to coordinate its members'political positions toward Iraq, the cumbersome processhasn't been able to match the speed and clarity of statementsand actions by individual members or by the U.S.   Indeed, most EC specialists on the Continent, as well asseveral other national leaders, say they see the stumblingover Iraq merely as further proof that a stronger politicalstructure is needed. They note that in such areas as tradeand commerce, concerted efforts by the 12 member states havealready made the EC a major world player.   &quot;It's clear that we must go further&quot; toward a common ECdefense and security policy, Belgian Prime Minister WilfriedMartens was quoted as saying in an interview publishedSaturday in La Libre Belgique, a Belgian newspaper.   As things stand, the EC's ability to play a major role insuch fast-moving international events as the Gulf crisis ismade nearly impossible by the maddening complexity of itsinstitutions. Under the Treaty of Rome, the EC's maincharter, military matters can't even be discussed. Suchissues can be broached only within the Western EuropeanUnion, which was created by a treaty in 1955 and which groupsonly nine of the nations in a defense pact.   More recent attempts to bring a narrower range of militaryand security matters under the authority of the EC itself, aswere made during the 1986 revision of the Treaty of Rome,have been blocked by the neutral Irish. In situations likethe Middle East crisis, the result is a merry-go-round ofmeetings in which the WEU and EC separately hash outinterrelated parts of the same problem.   Not surprisingly, it took the WEU nearly three weeks todecide to send a joint naval mission to the Gulf, partlybecause many of the ministers who had to meet were either onvacation or had to attend to duties at the national level.Similarly, a week after the U.S. moved to expel part ofIraq's diplomatic mission in Washington, EC diplomats stillhaven't taken a definite stand of their own.   Because of their limited deployments in the Gulf, ECcountries will have only limited influence in the way thecrisis unfolds. Defense specialists say that European forceswill in general still depend on the U.S. to be in charge ofoverall coordination if fighting begins.   This probably also means that the U.S. would do most ofthe fighting, if it comes to that. The massive Frenchaircraft carrier Clemenceau, for example, which is now in theIndian Ocean and heading for the Gulf, doesn't even haveattack aircraft on board. While it is equipped with 42helicopters, the fighting ship has been converted for thismission into a massive supply ship and operations base. WestGermany, meanwhile, says it can't take part in theU.N.-backed blockade of Iraq without a constitutional change.   And although Britain has been one of the nations mostdeeply involved in the Gulf force, even it has been reluctantto supply significant ground troops. Last week, Britain saidit was sending another destroyer and three minesweepers tocomplement the three-ship fleet and three dozen or so fighteraircraft it already has in the region. But experts say theforce is still relatively small.   Military preparedness hasn't been an EC priority in recentyears. Between 1988 and 1989, EC nations' defense spendingdidn't grow at all, remaining at about $131 billion at a timewhen the costs of replacing and maintaining equipment andpersonnel were skyrocketing, according to figures compiled bythe London-based International Institute for StrategicStudies.   The Continental nations argue that the European publicwould be more willing to support a unified EC military, whichcould actually have some influence in the world, than 12 tinyarmies that don't add up to much. An EC defense structure maysoon be the only way to keep any army in many EC countries,says Belgium's Mr. Champenois. &quot;If we keep going the way weare going nationally,&quot; he contends, &quot;we will end up with nodefense.&quot;   But that idea has its own set of problems, France beingone of them. Although a supporter of EC politicalintegration, France has so far been unwilling to includedefense in the discussions. Former French President CharlesDe Gaulle, who pulled France out of the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization's integrated command in 1966, is still a sacredfigure in French defense circles. French resistance to losingthe independence he nurtured -- especially with respect toFrance's nuclear force -- has brought to a halt most seriousdiscussions about EC defense.   Despite such hurdles, most experts believe that the Gulfcrisis will prove a watershed in forcing Europe to think moreclearly about the role it wants to play in the world. SaysDon Kerr, a defense specialist at the International Institutefor Strategic Studies: &quot;The U.S.'s position as the countrywhich has to send forces all over the globe is getting to bea good deal less comfortable&quot; for Washington, mainly becauseof the cost of such missions.   ---                     Uneven Allies                                                                                                          Though the combined armies of European Community countriesmake it look like a superpower...
