Their numerical and analytical results for the surface potentialand plasma transport differ considerably from those using traditionalBohm sheath analysis. For the purely absorbing surface, the authors'analytic technique extends the analysis of Kuhn with a temperature ratioT/sub i//T/sub e/ = tau = 1 to include an arbitrary value for tau. Simulationresults after equilibration and our time-independent theory agree exactlyfor tau = 0.1, 1.0, and 10.0. With PDW1 the authors observe that phi/subw/ initially drops from 0 to 4-8 times the final equilibrated phi/subw/. The minimum phi/sub w/ occurs at 2-5 times the transit time of anion with the mean velocity after the system is initialized. Note thatthe presheath region, which the authors define below by phi/sub n/, hasa zero electric field; hence the &quot;presheath acceleration&quot; of the ionsoccurs entirely in the source sheath within a few Debye lengths lengthsfrom the plasma source. The potential results for a large range of massand temperature ratios compare well with others who analytically modelsthe plasma-sheath equation for a bounded system with Boltzmann electrons.</TEXT></DOC>
