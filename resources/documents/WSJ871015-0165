In a test conducted by the government's National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md., researchers found that the drug, trimetrexate, was about as effective, but less toxic, than drugs currently used to fight a life-threatening type of pneumonia. The disease, called pneumocystis carnii pneumonia, or PCP, is caused by a single-celled parasite commonly found in the human lung. About half the patients with PCP can't endure the current standard treatments because of side effects, the researchers said.    Trimetrexate was developed by Warner-Lambert Co., Morris Plains, N.J., which has been testing it primarily against lung cancer. Because the drug is a potent destroyer of cell machinery, researchers used the drug in a special combination therapy in which they &quot;rescued&quot; normal tissue cells with an antidote.    The researchers cautioned that their results, while encouraging, were preliminary and required further testing. The drug hasn't been approved for use by doctors.    The Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta reports that PCP occurs in about 80% of AIDS patients, and it expects the total number of PCP cases will more than triple, to 100,000, in about three years. The pneumonia is rare except in patients whose immune system is severely compromised.    In the study, 38 of 49 patients treated with trimetrexate for 21 days were still alive two weeks later. This 78% survival rate is similar to standard treatment.    But NIH researchers said the results were significant because they occurred in patients who had advanced stages of PCP. For instance, 11 patients survived among a group of 16 who either failed to respond to or couldn't tolerate standard therapy.    Current treatment for PCP includes the drug commonly sold under the brand name Bactrim by Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., a Nutley, N.J., unit of Basel, Switzerland-based F. Hoffmann-La Roche andamp; Co., and the drug pentamidine sold by LyphoMed Inc., Rosemont, Ill.    Carmen Allegra of the NIH's National Cancer Institute, a lead author of the study published in this week's New England Journal of Medicine, said the key to the treatment was trimetrexate's combination with the vitamin leucovorin as an antidote. Trimetrexate works by interfering with a group of vitamins, called folates, necessary for cell activity. Leucovorin replenishes the vitamins in normal cells, but doesn't do so in cells of the organism that causes PCP.    The NIH soon will begin a year-long study in about 370 patients to compare trimetrexate against the standard treatment. Dr. Allegra said it is hoped that the combined treatment would keep AIDS patients alive longer and &quot;produce a better quality of life.&quot; The drug won't prevent PCP recurrences, and it doesn't affect the underlying AIDS virus, he said. </TEXT></DOC>
