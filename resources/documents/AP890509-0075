(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A 69-year-old former Army captain has beenplaced on three years' probation and fined $10,000 for conspiringto ship weapons to forces loyal to former Philippine PresidentFerdinand Marcos.   U.S. District Judge Alfred J. Lechner Jr. on Monday also orderedLeon Dicker to perform 600 hours of community service.   Dicker pleaded guilty Monday, admitting he tried to make theshipments in 1987, months before two coup attempts failed to returnMarcos to power.   Dicker was convicted in 1987 and sentenced to four years inprison, but a federal appeals court ruled that testimony wasimproperly introduced and overturned the verdict.   Gemmo Trinidad, Marcos' spokesman in Hawaii, said he had notheard of the case and could not comment on it.   Known as ``The General'' to his associates, Dicker was an Armycaptain in World War II and is a disbarred Hewlett, N.Y., attorney.He said he believed it would be in the United States' interest toship the arms to the Philippines.   Marcos fled the Philippines Feb. 26, 1986, amid an uprising thatcarried Corazon Aquino to power.   Dicker was arrested in 1987 in a sting operation as he drove towhat he believed was a warehouse containing the weapons.   The indictment said he conspired to ship M-60 machine guns andIsraeli-made Uzi submachine guns to Thailand. Dicker told the courtthat Thailand was identified as a destination only to obtain anexport license.   Federal law requires that arms exports be licensed by the StateDepartment.   Assistant U.S. Attorney Claudia J. Flynn said an investigationwas continuing in the case. She supported the judge's request forno prison time, citing Dicker's cooperation with the investigationand his age.</TEXT></DOC>
