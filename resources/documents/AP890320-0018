The General Accounting Office concluded in a new report that theEPA is letting the growing number of contractors in the Superfundprogram police themselves on potential conflicts of interest.   Procedures are so lax that the agency might not discover acompany it hired to investigate a hazardous waste dump also wasworking for the polluter of the site, the GAO said in a reportobtained over the weekend by The Associated Press.   Rep. John D. Dingell, D-Mich., who requested the study, wrote EPAAdministrator William K. Reilly on Friday, ``The Superfund contractprogram must avoid at all costs the morass of abuses and conflict ofinterest problems that plague the defense procurement system.   ``While it is important ... for contractors to have effectiveinternal procedures in place, it is also important that EPApersonnel have the independent capability to police the Superfundcontract system.''   Dingell is chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committeeand the panel's investigations subcommittee, which has beeninvestigating the Superfund program.   The report concluded, ``This system is currently dependent oncontractors' identifying and informing appropriate EPA officialsabout conflicts.''   It warned that a company working for both sides could feed theEPA biased data, thereby weakening legal efforts to recover cleanupcosts from a polluter.   The report said the EPA ``relies heavily on contractors to avoidconflicts, but does not review contractors' performance to ensurecompliance with EPA's conflict of interest requirements.''   The investigators said few conflicts have been found so far, butcautioned, ``This risk is a growing possibility in light of EPA'scontinuing efforts to expand the number of contractors used toperform remedial and technical enforcement activities.''   In the 1988 fiscal year, more than $600 million in contracts wereapproved by the agency for Superfund projects, compared to $97.3million in fiscal 1982.   Superfund, an $8.5 billion program to clean up hazardous wastesites, relies increasingly on private companies for the preliminaryinvestigations of polluted sites, because the government has neitherthe manpower nor the expertise to do the work.   David O'Connor, director of EPA's procurement and contractsmanagement division, said, ``We're not in a position to police everysituation with every firm out there. The amount of effort requiredto do that would just be overwhelming.''   He said a company caught working for both the agency andpolluters at the same site could face a ban on EPA work ortermination of the contract.   ``We could take the position of being purists,'' he said, byprohibiting even ``the appearance'' of a conflict. But he asked,``How strict can we get in appearance situations and still havecompanies that will work for us? There is a limited industry. Wedon't want to set up private sector contractors vs. public sectorcontractors.''   The GAO investigators looked at seven contracts valued at $745million and involving work at sites all across the country.   Five of the contracts were for studies that led torecommendations on how to clean up the sites. Two contracts were forinvestigating the parties responsible for pollution, so legal casescould be developed for recovery of cleanup costs.</TEXT></DOC>
