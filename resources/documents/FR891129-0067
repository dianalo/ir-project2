Introduction</ITAG>On October 23, 1983, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'')filed with the Commission pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Securities ExchangeAct of 1934 (``Act'') \1\<NOTE/> and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,\2\<NOTE/> copies of a proposed rule change to adopt the Exchange'sequities specialist performance, allocation and reallocation procedures,including revisions to its specialist unit evaluation questionnaire.\3\<NOTE/> No comments were received in connection with the proposal.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4 (1989)<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ The proposal was noticed in Securities Exchange Act ReleaseNo. 20353, November 4, 1983, 48 FR 51992. The Amex submitted AmendmentNo. 1 to the proposal on April 23, 1984; however, due to a number of concernsraised by the amendment, the Commission determined not to publish the amendmentfor notice and comment, but rather requested the Amex to provide additionalamendments to the filing that would address the Commission's concerns.In response, Amex submitted Amendment No. 2 to the filing on February 7,1985. Amendment No. 3 to the filing was submitted on May 20, 1985 restatingAmex's ``issuer's choice'' program that permits issuers to determine whichAmex specialist will be allocated its stock under certain circumstances.See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 22312, August 12, 1985, 50 FR 33139and note 15 <T3>infra</T3> discussing Amex's issuer choice program. Amendment No. 4to the filing revises the Exchange's Specialist Unit Evaluation Questionnaireand was submitted on March 17, 1988. See Securities Exchange Act ReleaseNo. 25542, March 31, 1988, 53 FR 11387. Amendment No. 5, submitted on April14, 1989, makes some clarifying amendments and codifies Amex's existingpolicy on the inability of a specialist and its firm to compete for newallocations when the specialist is a member of the Allocations Committee.Under Amex Rule 170, if the Exchange determines that a specialist substantiallyor continuously fails to engage in a course of dealing calculated to assistin the maintenance of fair and orderly markets or fails to meet other performancestandards, it may suspend or revoke the specialist's registration in oneor more assigned securities. Pursuant to the rule, Amex has proposed proceduresfor the evaluation of specialist performance and for the allocation andreallocation of securities. The procedures are designed to measure, amongother things, the quality of specialist performance utilizing certain performance-basedcriteria and to provide an incentive for quality performance both throughthe Exchange's allocation process and through the imposition of non-disciplinarysanctions, including the reallocation of stocks for continued unsatisfactoryspecialist performance.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Description of the Proposal</ITAG>A. Performance Measurement CriteriaAmex's Committee on Specialist and Registered Trader Performance (``PerformanceCommittee'') \4\<NOTE/> has been delegated authority to review and evaluate specialistperformance. The Performance Committee assesses specialist performanceutilizing two evaluation tools: (1) A quarterly specialist unit evaluationquestionnaire (``questionnaire''), which elicits the opinions of floorbrokers regarding the overall performance of a specialist, and (2) PerformanceCommittee ratings, which are based upon a review of trading data and evaluationof market making performance on questionable trades identified by Amexstaff over the course of an evaluation period. In addition, the procedurescontain minimum standards of acceptable specialist performance. Any specialistwhose market making performance falls below the designated threshold levelswill be subject to a variety of remedial measures, including possible reallocationof their specialty stock(s).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ The Performance Committee is appointed by Amex's Boardof Governors (``Board'') and is charged with evaluating specialist performanceas well as taking appropriate corrective action to improve the qualityof Amex markets.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. The Specialist Unit Evaluation Questionnaire</ITAG>Under its specialist evaluation procedures, Amex distributes the questionnaireon a quarterly basis to floor brokers and registered traders who are requestedto evaluate a specialist's performance based upon their floor contact withthe unit. Amendment No. 4 to SR-Amex-83-27 substantially revises the questionnaire.\5\<NOTE/> Among other things, the revisions expand from 4 to 26 thenumber of questions contained on the questionnaire. In addition, the Exchangeproposes to replace the existing numerical grading scale with a new alphabeticalrating scale. Respondents will grade a specialist unit's performance foreach question utilizing A, F, S, O, and N, where A=Always, F=Frequently,S=Satisfactory, O=Occasionally, N=Never. The alphabetical rating is translatedinto a numerical rating by correlating A to 1, F to 2, S to 3, O to 4,and N to 5. The rating is then compared to the average of all units and,depending on the deviation from the average, the unit is assigned a numericalrating between 1 and 5 which is provided to the Allocations Committee.\6\<NOTE/> Any specialist that receives a 4 or 5 rating on the questionnairein any quarter is automatically precluded from applying for new allocationsuntil its questionnaire rating improves. In addition, the Performance Committeewill consider recommending the reallocation of a unit's specialty stockwhere the unit receives a 4 or 5 overall questionnaire rating, coupledwith a similar Performance Committee rating, over two consecutive quartersand where lesser remedial efforts designed to improve the unit's performancehave failed.\7\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ <T3>See</T3> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 25542, March 31, 1988,53 FR 11387.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ The Exchange also proposes to redesignate the four majorareas of performance evaluated on the questionnaire to include principalobligations, agency/fiduciary obligations, communication function, andauction market maintenance.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ <T3>See</T3> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 22312, August 12, 1985,50 FR 33139 (``August 12, 1985 Release'').<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Performance Committee Ratings</ITAG>As provided by the procedures, the Performance Committee, or a subcommitteethereof, meets regularly with the staff of Trading Analysis to review specificinstances of poor performance by a specialist which have been uncoveredby an analysis of certain trading data, including daily transaction journals,information from automated exception reports, specialist principal tradingactivity reports, and customer complaints. The Performance Committee reviewsthe questionable trades for market continuity, depth, stabilization, andquotation spread. In addition, the Performance Committee may meet withmembers of the particular unit under review, at which time the unit isprovided an opportunity to defend its performance.\8\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ See SR-Amex-83-27, Amendment No. 2 (``Amendment No. 2''),pg. 5.The Performance Committee rates the specialist's performance on a scaleof 1 (least severe) to 6 (most severe) based upon its determination ofthe severity of a particular instance of poor performance. In those instancesin which a unit is assigned a rating of 3, the Performance Committee willconsider the imposition of remedial action; however, such action is withinthe discretion of the Performance Committee. A rating of 4, 5, or 6 automaticallytriggers the imposition of one or more remedial measures, including anadmonitory letter, preclusion from future allocations, suspension of aspecialist's registration, or a recommendation of reallocation of one ormore of the specialist's registered securities to the Allocations Committee.\9\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ See Amendment No. 2, pg. 6.Performance Committee ratings are divided into two categories: interimPerformance Committee ratings and quarterly Performance Committee ratings.Under the first category of ratings, Performance Committee reviews onlyare triggered by individual instances of performance weakness by a specialist.The Performance Committee assigns the specialist a rating which may ormay not trigger remedial action, depending upon the severity of the particulartrade(s) under review. The Performance Committee's quarterly ratings arebased upon any interim ratings conferred throughout the quarterly evaluationperiod. The interim Performance Committee ratings are noted in the specialistunit's permanent performance file maintained by Trading Analysis, whichis made available to the Allocations Committee. \1\\0\<NOTE/> Each interim performance rating serves to lessen a unit'soverall quarterly rating.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\ We note, however, that under the procedures, an interimPerformance Committee review may not necessarily result in the impositionof remedial action, if, for example, the specialist under review receivesa 1 or 2 interim Performance Committee rating. Such a rating would indicatethat while the specific trades raised sufficient concerns to merit an interimreview, they were not serious enough to warrant Performance Committee action.The Performance Committee also reviews the permanent performance filesof all specialists on a quarterly basis. Each unit is given a compositerating based on the number and severity of individual ratings in the unit'spermanent file in relation to the number of its assigned stocks. \1\\1\<NOTE/> The Performance Committee then produces a final rating ona 1 (highest) to 5 (lowest) scale determined by the deviation from theaverage. A specialist unit receiving a score of 4 or 5 is ineligible fornew allocations until its ratings improve in the next or a subsequent quarter.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\1\ According to the Amex, specialist units whose performancedoes not trigger a review under the interim procedures will generally receivean excellent quarterly performance rating.B. Allocation and ReallocationProcedures<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Allocation Procedures</ITAG>When the Exchange has approved an issue for listing, a new AllocationsCommittee is convened. \1\\2\<NOTE/> In allocating the new listing, the Allocations Committeeconsiders a variety of factors; however, the most significant factors consideredby the Allocations Committee are Performance Committee ratings, questionnaireratings and statistical data concerning the particular issue to be allocatedand each applicant unit. This data is provided to each Allocations Committeeon the Summary Statistics for Allocations Committee Sheet (``StatisticSheet''). \1\\3\<NOTE/> All specialist units are deemed to have applied for eachstock allocation, except (1) the specialist firm whose member is scheduledto serve on the Allocations Committee for the particular allocation meeting;\1\\4\<NOTE/> (2) those units that are subject to an allocation freezedue to poor performance ratings; or (3) those units that have withdrawnfrom consideration for a particular allocation by letter because of a conflictof interest or the incompatibility of the issue to be allocated with theunit's current portfolio of stocks. In addition, the Allocations Committeeis provided with any letters from specialist unit applicants written insupport of their applications. Under Amex's issuer's choice program, anew Amex issuer is permitted to select its specialist unit from a listof seven specialists selected by the Allocations Committee based on performancerelated criteria. Another option allows newly-listed companies to eliminateup to three specialists from a list of ten specialists, compiled by theAllocations Committee, considered eligible for the company's listing. TheAllocations Committee makes a final selection from the units remainingon the list. \1\\5\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\2\ The Allocations Committee has been delegated authorityby Amex's Board to allocate and reallocate equity securities to specialistunits. It is composed of eight members, including a Committee chairman,who is generally a floor governor and only votes to break a tie. The sevenvoting members consist of six floor brokers (chosen from a roster of approximately25 brokers) and one specialist (chosen from a roster of approximately 15specialists). Four floor brokers and the specialist are selected on a rotatingbasis from their respective rosters. In order to preserve continuity fromone Committee to another the remaining two floor brokers on the Committeeare selected from a sub-group of the floor broker roster and serve fiveconsecutive Committees. Allocations Committee action is triggered by thevote of two-thirds of the voting members. <T3>See</T3> Amendment No. 2, pg. 12.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\3\ The statistics sheet contains aggregate statisticalinformation about all specialist units regarding the number of issues perunit per specialist, average daily equity and option volume per specialistfor the most recent 12 and 3 month periods, manpower, average principalparticipation for each unit for the most recent six months, and the numberof issues allocated in the last 12 months. In addition to this data, TradingAnalysis also apprises the Allocations Committee of any pending changesin the composition of a unit and any relevant findings by Amex's ExaminationDivision as to a unit's financial status.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\4\ Under the policy, both the specialist Allocations Committeemember and his firm are ineligible to apply for any stock to be allocatedby the Allocations Committee in its regularly scheduled meeting. The banon the firm's participation in the allocation process is only triggeredwhen one of its specialists sits on the Allocations Committee; however,because a new Allocations Committee consisting of new members is convenedfor each allocation, the specialist Allocations Committee member's firmis only affected by the ban for that particular meeting or until anotherspecialist is selected to serve on the Allocations Committee. <T3>See</T3> Amendment No. 5, dated April 14, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\5\ See generally, Securities Exchange Act Release No.23593, September 5, 1986, 51 FR 32985. We note that in implementing theoptional allocation programs, Amex adopted guidelines designed to ensurethat pre-allocation contacts between issuers and Amex specialists are appropriate.Under the guidelines, specialists are required to notify Amex's MarketingDepartment of any contact they wish to initiate with unlisted companies.Amex could, in these instances, request the units to avoid making suchcontacts if it believes such activities could hinder its marketing effortsor otherwise be inappropriate. In addition, specialists are required toreport all unplanned contacts with prospective companies. Once an issuerdetermines to list on Amex, specialists are barred from making contactwith the company. Moreover, if a newly-listed issuer wishes to interviewone or more of Amex's final list of seven specialists under its issuer'schoice program, Amex offers to arrange telephone interviews or in personinterviews on its premises. Failure by a specialist to comply with theguidelines could result in disciplinary action. <T3>Id.</T3><ITAG tagnum="81">2. Reallocation Procedures</ITAG>Under Amex reallocation procedures, an Allocations Committee is convenedto reallocate securities in the following circumstances. First, reallocationproceedings are commenced when the Performance Committee recommends thereallocation of a unit's specialty stock due to (1) the failure of theunit to maintain satisfactory performance in a particular instance, (2)consistently poor performance ratings,\1\\6\<NOTE/> or (3) a significant change within a unit, such as a mergeror dissolution. Second, a stock will be reallocated if a specialist requestswithdrawal of its registration in a particular security. Third, a specialist'sregistration in a specialty stock can be cancelled by the Allocations Committeeas a result of disciplinary action. Finally, the Exchange may reallocateone or more of a specialist unit's securities on an emergency basis, ifit determines that the unit is in such financial or operating conditionso as to jeopardize the safety of investors, its creditors or other Exchangemembers.\1\\7\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\6\ For example, the Performance Committee will considerrecommending a reallocation of a unit's stock if the unit's performanceremians unsatisfactory despite remedial efforts for two consecutive quarters,as demonstrated by a 4 or 5 questionnaire or Performance Committee rating.See Amendment No. 2, pg. 16. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\7\ Under these procedures, Amex's Chairman of the Boardor President, in consultation with all Floor Governors available, has thepower to recommend an Emergency Reallocation for the reasons noted above.See August 12, 1985 Release and Amendment No. 2, pgs. 16 and 21. D. ProceduralSafeguards Under the procedures, all specialists are appraised of their performanceratings throughout the evalaution process and are offered an opportunityto meet with the Performance Committee or one of its subcommittees. Inaddition, a specialist subject to a performance review or that is requiredto appear before the Performance Committee may be represented by legalor other counsel, if it so desires.\1\\8\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\8\ See Article V, section 1(a) of Amex's Constitution.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Individual Performance Ratings</ITAG>Each time a specialist's performance is reviewed by a subcommittee or thefull Performance Committee, the specialist unit is notified of the reviewand given access to all materials to be reviewed. Specialist unit membersare provided an opportunity to meet with the Performance Committee to defendtheir performance or to revise mitigating factors; in some instances morethan one meeting may be necessary, particularly in those cases in whichthe questionable performance is complex or potentially serious. Followingthe Performance Committee's ratings, a member of the Performance Committeemeets with members of the specialist unit to discuss the Performance Committee'srationale for its rating.\1\\9\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\9\ See August 12, 1985 Release. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Quarterly Performance Ratings</ITAG>Meetings between the Performance Committee, or a subcommittee thereof,and a specialist unit to discuss the specialist's final quarterly performancerating may be at the specialist's or the Performance Committee's request,depending upon the final quarterly performance rating conferred. Meetingsbetween a specialist receiving a rating of 1 to 3 and the Performance Committeeare generally convened at the specialist's request. In the case of a 4or 5 rating, the unit is requested to meet with the subcommittee of thePerformance Committee and Trading Analysis to discuss the Performance Committee'srating and measure for improvement. In addition, in those instances inwhich a a specialist unit that receives a 4 or 5 rating has received substandardratings in previous quarters, follow-up meetings are held as needed duringthe subsequent quarter to closely monitor the remedial measures being takenby the unit. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Performance Reallocations</ITAG>In any case in which the Performance Committee determines that it willconsider recommending the reallocation of a security or securities as aresult of poor performance, it first provides written notice and an opportunityto be heard to the particular specialist. The written notice contains thespecific grounds to be considered as the basis for the reallocation. Ifa specialist unit does not wish to be present at a hearing, it is requiredto sign a waiver of the right to a hearing. The members of the specialist unit have an opportunity to be heard on thespecific grounds to be considered by the Performance Committee and a writtenrecord of any such hearing is maintained. Following the reallocation hearing,the Performance Committee informs the members of the unit in writing ofits determination and its basis therefor. The decision of a majority ofthe members of the Performance Committee is final, subject to the unit'sright to appeal the decision to Amex's Board.\2\\0\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\0\ In this regard, we note that all specialist units areentitled to appeal Performance or Allocations Committee decisions to Amex'sBoard. The appeals are heard <T3>de novo </T3>and are adjudicated by the Board's Executive Committee.All Executive Committee decisions are final. See Article II, Section 2of Amex's Constitution. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Discussion </ITAG>The Commission strongly supports efforts by the Amex and other exchangesto encourage quality specialist performance through its specialist performanceevaluation process. We note that in designing its program, Amex reviewsboth broker evaluations and trading data, evaluating market making performanceon questionable trades, to monitor and identify those specialist unitswhose performance, either on an individual or continuous basis, falls belowminimum acceptable standards contained in the procedures. The Commissionbelieves that the performance evaluation measures adequately should addressperformance weakness by specialist units and should be useful to motivatespecialists to improve their performance. Accordingly, after reviewingAmex's proposal, we believe that it is consistent with the requirementsof the Act, particularly Section 6, and will strengthen the Exchange'sspecialist system as well as further investor protection and the publicinterest. With regard to Amex's questionnaire, the Commission believes that the expansionof the number of survey questions from 4 to 26 is a significant improvementand should enhance this portion of the procedures for several reasons.The additional questions should enable Amex to elicit broker opinions onspecialist performance in a broader range of performance areas. In thisregard, we note that although specialist performance will continue to beanalyzed in four major categories, each category will now contain morequestions intended to address the different aspects of the particular performancecategory. As a result, the expanded questionnaire should provide Amex withmore information to consider when assessing specialist performance, therebyensuring that final questionnaire ratings will be more balanced and comprehensive.In addition to the questionnaire, the Commission believes that PerformanceCommittee ratings should facilitate the identification of poorly performingspecialists on a continuous basis. In this connection, although overallperformance evaluations are conducted quarterly, Amex constantly will monitorspecialist trading activity to detect questionable trades; once Amex identifiestrading irregularities it will be able to evaluate the specialist's performanceand impose any specific remedial measures where appropriate. Further, theCommission believes that the factors employed in reviewing trading activityanalyzing continuity, depth, stabilization, and quotation spreads shouldprovide Amex with an accurate and reliable measure of the quality of specialistperformance. Accordingly, the Commission believes that the combinationof a questionnaire and review of trading data for each unit should provideAmex with a balanced, comprehensive assessment of specialist performance,and, as noted above, simplify the task of identifying and correcting performanceweakness among specialists. While the Commission generally believes that Amex's procedures are adequate,the absence of relative performance standards in Amex's procedures raisesconcern. The Commission has long favored the incorporation of relativeperformance standards into the specialist evaluation process so that specialistswho were regularly among the lowest ranked specialist units would be subjectto performance reviews, regardless of whether their performance met a predeterminedlevel of unacceptable performance.\2\\1\<NOTE/> The need for Amex to adopt such relative performance standardshas been highlighted by specialist performance on the Amex during the Octobermarket break. In the Division of Market Regulation's (``Division'') reporton the October 1987 market break, the Division examined specialist performanceon the Amex on October 19 and 20, 1987.\2\\2\<NOTE/> Although some Amex specialists appeared to perform well underthe adverse conditions, the Division found a general decline in overallspecialist performance on October 19 and 20 and found several instancesof questionable individual specialist performance. In addition, the Divisionnoted its concern about the number of stocks that never opened due to orderimbalances and the large number of trading halts and delayed openings inAmex stocks. The Division concluded that the wide disparity in specialistperformance underscored the need for the Amex to develop relative, objectivestandards of performance for evaluating specialists.\2\\3\<NOTE/> The Commission continues to believe that the adoption ofrelative performance measures would substantially strengthen Amex's evaluationprocedures, and again, strongly urges the Amex to develop such proceduresin the near future.\2\\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\1\ See e.g., letters from Douglas Scarff, Director, Divisionof Market Regulation, to John J. Phelan, Jr., President, New York StockExchange (``NYSE''), dated November 10, 1981 and August 18, 1982; letterfrom Richard G. Ketchum, Director, Division of Market Regulation to JohnJ. Phelan, Jr. dated July 30, 1986 and Securities Exchange Act ReleaseNo. 34-25681, May 9, 1988, 53 FR 17287 approving the NYSE's specialistperformance evaluation and improvement program on a two year pilot basis.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\2\ See Division of Market Regulation, <T3>The October 1987 Market Break, </T3>February 1988 at 4-29.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\3\ <T3>Id. </T3>at xvii. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\4\ We also believe Amex's procedures could be improvedby the development of threshold levels of acceptable performance in a varietyof areas capable of objective evaluation such as timeliness of openings.In addition although the Performance Committee analyzes depth, continuity,stabilization and quotation spreads on particular trades that raise concerns,minimum standards should be developed for evaluating overall market makingperformance among all specialists. Despite these recommendations and theabsence of relative performance standards, as discussed further in thisSection, Amex's proposed policy meets the requirements of the Act and isan important step to encourage improved specialist performance. The Commission also believes that the powers available to Amex to addresspoor performance, in addition to the actual exercise of these powers, isextremely important. In particular, we believe that the remedial measuresavailable to Amex, such a preclusion from future allocations or the reallocationof stocks, should provide a strong incentive for units to improve or maintainquality performance. Moreover, the Commission believes that Amex's procedurescontain sufficient procedural safeguards to ensure that specialists whoseperformance triggers some form of review will receive the appropriate noticeand opportunity to be heard. Under the procedures, specialists are guaranteedthe opportunity to be heard before the Performance Committee or one ofits subcommittees throughout the evaluation, allocation, and reallocationprocess. In addition, as mentioned earlier, when required to appear beforethe Performance Committee for a hearing, the specialist unit may be representedby legal or other counsel. Written notice is provided to specialists requiredto appear before the Performance Committee, a written record is maintainedof the hearing, and the specialist unit is provided with a written decisioncontaining the Committee's rationale for its determination. Specialistsmay also appeal a Performance Committee decision through Amex's appeallateprocess. The Commission believes that these procedures should adequatelysafeguard the rights of specialists subject to remedial action. Finally, the Commission believes that the allocation guidelines adoptedby Amex are appropriate. In particular, the Commission believes that AllocationsCommittee consideration of both the Performance Committee and broker evaluationratings, in addition to other supplemental data such as a unit's dealerparticipation rates, staffing and current number of Amex stocks, shouldensure that the Committee reviews a broad range of factors in its allocationawards.\25\<NOTE/> Accordingly, because allocation awards will be largely basedupon a unit's on-floor performance, the Commission believes that the allocationprocess should provide a significant incentive for specialists to strivefor optimal performance in order to compete successfully for additionallistings.\26\<NOTE/> Such superior performance should, in the Commission's view,enhance market quality as well as facilitate the execution of public orders,which ultimately benefits the Exchange, its specialist community and theinvesting public. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\25\ We note, that the Allocations Committee's considerationof statistical data also includes a review of the number of new allocationsa unit received over the preceding year. While the Commission believesthat this information can be marginally useful for deciding close contestsfor a new allocation, the Commission nonetheless believes that recent allocationsshould not be used to preclude a more clearly qualified specialist unitfrom receiving a new listing. Accordingly, Amex has stated that this criteriononly will be used when reviewing the applications of specialist units thatare equally qualified to receive an allocation as determined by the measuresnoted above. <T3>See</T3> Letter from Jules L. Winters, Senior Vice President, TradingAnalysis and Market Operations, Amex, to Sharon Lawson, Special Counsel,Division of Market Regulation, Securities and Exchange Commission. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\26\ In this regard, the Commission believes that the keycriteria for allocating stocks to specialist units should be specialistperformance as evidenced by the result of Amex's evaluation process. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Conclusion </ITAG>In assessing Amex's proposal, a primary Commission concern has been thatthe evaluation procedures serve as a meaningful incentive for quality specialistperformance. The Commission believes that Amex's evaluation program addressesthis concern as well as additional concerns regarding such issues as dueprocess protection and proper evaluation procedures. Accordingly, the Commissionfinds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirementsof the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a nationalsecurities exchange, and in particular, the requirements of section 6 andthe rules and regulations thereunder. It is therefore ordered, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, thatthe above-mentioned proposed rule change be, and hereby is, approved.<ITAG tagnum="21">For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuantto delegated authority.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: November 22, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jonathan G.
