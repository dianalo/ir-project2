Britain's Defense Ministry said Sunday in London that the HMSBerkeley, HMS Chiddingfold and HMS Cottesmore would take about threeweeks to reach their home port of Rosyth, near Edinburgh, Scotland.   HMS Herald, an ocean survey ship serving as support vessel forthe mine-clearing trio, left earlier this month and anotherauxiliary ship, HMS Diligence, will depart with the minehunters, theministry said.   The withdrawal, first announced more than a month ago, wasunrelated to a renewed call by the Soviet Union during the weekendfor all foreign warships to leave the Persian Gulf now that acease-fire between Iraq and Iran has remained in effect for sixmonths.   The minehunters' departure leaves the Royal Navy's ``ArmillaPatrol,'' consisting of three frigates and a support ship, torepresent British seapower in the gulf. Officials say there are noplans to withdraw the patrol.   It also leaves the United States virtually alone with the task offurther mine-clearing in the strategic waterway. U.S. officersestimate there may still be as many as 150 to 200 mines laid by bothsides in the gulf.   Six wooden-hulled U.S. minesweepers, dispatched to the gulf inlate 1987 and still on duty, are the last foreign ships based in thewaterway equipped to deal with mines.   The Iranian navy claims it has cleared Iran's coastal waters, butthese do not include the gulf's main shipping lanes, where the minethreat was greatest.   The mines occasionally break loose from their underwater mooringsand drift into shipping lanes.   U.S. and British naval officers put little stock in the Iranianclaims because they do not believe the Iranian navy is equipped toclear mines.   Neither Iran nor Iraq is known to have offered to provide chartsof its minefields, particularly in the northern gulf.   The United States and Britain were among seven Western countriesthat sent warships to the gulf, or reinforced units already there,in 1987 to protect shipping caught in the escalating ``tanker war,''a spinoff of the Iran-Iraq conflict. The conflict included a spateof incidents involving Iranian-laid mines.   While foreign navies have been scaling back since Iran and Iraqagreed to a truce Aug. 20, there were indications that thewithdrawal of British minehunters amounted to a policy reversal.   William Waldegrave, Britain's Minister of State for Foreign andCommonwealth Affairs, told a news conference in Saudi Arabia Oct. 23that the anti-mine force was likely to have ``a continuing role fora good many years.''   During a visit to Iraq Saturday, Soviet Foreign Minister EduardShevardnadze said Moscow was prepared to remove its forces.   His remarks were seen as aimed chiefly at the United States,which has reduced its force by four warships since the cease-firebut still has 23 in the region, including 14 in the gulf.   U.S. officials say that while force size is tailored to thethreat at any given time, the United States intends to continue its40-year naval presence in the Persian Gulf.</TEXT></DOC>
