The respected Middle East Economic Survey reported that theSaudis will insist its share of OPEC's output remain at the current24.46 percent even if non-proportionate quota increases are grantedto other members of the cartel.   Ian Seymour, editor of the Cyprus-based oil industry newsletter,wrote after discussions with senior Saudi officials that ``there isno way in which Saudi Arabia would be prepared to surrender even atoken part of its output share in order to facilitate agreement ona new quota system'' in Vienna.   Members of the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries, have been squabbling over quota allocations and severalnations have consistently produced beyond their established limitsin open defiance of the OPEC ceilings.   OPEC is scheduled to meet Saturday in Vienna, Austria, to seek aformula to satisfy demands by various members for higher productionlimits while at the same time trying to avoid a major hike in theoverall quota that could hurt prices.   World oil prices have remained relatively stable in recentmonths, thanks to strong demand from developing nations.   Oil ministers from Persian Gulf nations, including Saudi Arabia,held a strategy session here Monday in preparation for the OPECmeeting.   An official, speaking on condition of anoynmity, said ministersfrom the Gulf Cooperation Council ``discussed developments in theworld oil market and reviewed future oil strategy for the GCCmember states'' during a 90-minute session.   The six GCC ministers met after a session of the 11-memberOrganization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries.   In addition to Saudi Arabia, the GCC includes Qatar, Bahrain andOman as well as Kuwait and the U.A.E. OAPEC includes Saudi Arabia,Kuwait, Qatar, Iraq, Algeria, Libya, the U.A.E., Egypt, Bahrain,Syria and Tunisia.   Algerian Oil Minister Sadiq Busina, after the OAPEC session,called for a ``flexibile approach'' on the quota distribution. Hesaid that ``such an agreement must be reached fast.''   Algeria, an OPEC hardliner who favors low output to bolsterprices, has been critical of OPEC's decision in September to raisethe overall quota by 1 million barrels a day in the fourth quarterto 20.5 million barrels daily.   Seymour also wrote: ``There is considerable scepticism in Saudioil circles as to whether the quota redistribution proposed inGeneva would be either achievable or workable.''   At the September meeting in Geneva Iran introduced a new planfor sharing production, which got only preliminary considerationbecause it was presented late in the session.   The proposal, expected to be re-heard at Saturday's meeting,called for raising the overall output cap to 21.5 million barrels aday to meet the demands primarily of Kuwait and the United ArabEmirates. Gabon and Ecuador also would get higher ceilings, whileother member quotas would remain the same or be reduced.</TEXT></DOC>
