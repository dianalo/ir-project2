They are: Hydro Engineering,Inc., ERA Docket No. 88-19-NG (53 FR 25203, July 5, 1988); Midland CogenerationVenture Limited Partnership, ERA Docket No. 88-39-NG (53 FR 34811, September8, 1988); and, Vector Energy (U.S.A.) Inc., ERA Docket No. 88-63-NG (53FR 47857, November 28, 1988). This notice supplements those notices withrespect to DOE's compliance with the National Environmental Policy Actof 1969 (NEPA).The DOE has concluded that compliance with the NEPA for the proposed actionsto grant or deny these import applications can be achieved by invokingtwo categorical exclusions in the DOE NEPA Guidelines (52 FR 47662, December15, 1987). Comments on this procedure may be submitted by any interestedperson no later than March 17, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2><ITAG tagnum="15">William L.

A categorical exclusion is a class of DOE action whichnormally does not require the preparation of either an environmental impactstatement (EIS) or environmental assessment (EA). In addition, the DOEproposed to change the classification in Sectioin D of approval or disapprovalof an import/export authorization involving minor new construction fromthe type of actions normally requiring preparation of an EIS to the typeof actions normally requiring preparation of an EA, but not necessarilyan EIS. As indicated in the August 9 <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice, the DOE is applying the proposed changespending a final decision on their adoption.Under these changes, actions that grant or deny import authorizations whereno new pipeline is needed but where new ancillary facilities, such as acogeneration facility, are to be constructed would normally require thepreparation of an EA, because they involved ``minor new construction.''However, for the reasons stated below, we believe that preparation of anEA for these actions is unnecessary due to the joint application of twoother categorical exclusions contained in the DOE NEPA guidelines.The environmental impacts of constructing and operating new cogenerationfacilities have been addressed on numerous occasions by the Economic RegulatoryAdministration (ERA) in conjunction with processing exemption petitionsunder the Powerplant and Industrial Fuel Use Act (FUA) (10 U.S.C. 3801<T3>et seq</T3>, as amended), and as a result, such actions have been granteda categorical exclusion from further NEPA review (52 FR 47670, December15, 1987). The cogeneration facilities to be constructed in connectionwith these import applications are identical to those facilities coveredby the categorical exclusion for FUA actions. Therefore, it is an appropriateapplication of another categorical exclusion contained in the DOE guidelinesfor ``actions that are substantially the same as other actions for whichthe environmental effects have already been assessed in a NEPA documentand determined by DOE to be clearly insignificant and where such assessmentis currently valid'' (52 FR 47668, December 15, 1987) to extend the FUAcategorical exclusion for cogeneration facilities to the grant of an authorizationto import natural gas under the NGA which results in the construction andoperation of a cogeneration facility.A categorical exclusion raises a rebuttable presumption that the Federalaction will not significantly affect the quality of the human environment.Unless it appears during the proceedings on these import applications thatthe grant or denial of authorization will significantly affect the qualityof the human environment, the Office of Fuels Programs expects that noadditional environmental review will be required.A copy of each application is available for inspection and copying in theOffice of Fuels Programs Docket Room, Fossil Energy, U.S. Department ofEnergy, Forrestal Building, Room 3F-056, 1000 Independence Ave., SW., Washington,DC 20585.
