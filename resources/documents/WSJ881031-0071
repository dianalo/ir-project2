The offer had been set to expire last Thursday.    Nomad said 5,062,008 shares had been tendered as of Thursday. When combined with the 1,027,000 shares owned by Nomad's general partner, American Magnetics Corp. of Sherman Oaks, Calif., and its limited partner, Ballantrae Partners L.P. of New York, the tendered shares represent about 64% of Damon's common.    Nomad is offering $24 a share, or more than $200 million, and proposes a spinoff to Damon's shareholders of Damon's 61% interest in Damon Biotech Inc., a biotechnology concern. In a statement, Nomad said its offer has a current value of $26.11 a share, based on Damon's closing price of $21.125 on Thursday.    Damon Corp., a clinical laboratory operator based in Needham, Mass., declined to comment on Nomad's proposal. Damon closed Friday at $21.375, up 37.5 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange. </TEXT></DOC>
