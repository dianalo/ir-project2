The U.S. export credit agency said the borrower is the Nzoia Sugar Co., which awarded a contract to Arkel International of Baton Rouge, La., to bring capacity of the sugar refinery up to 75,000 metric tons a year from the current 25,000 tons. The sugar will be sold primarily in Kenya's domestic market.    The project involves about $23.5 million in U.S. exports of equipment and services, U.S. officials said.    The bank's loan will be at a 7.4% annual rate, with repayment scheduled for 20 semi-annual installments starting in October 1990. </TEXT></DOC>
