Even then, the networks are likely to resort to reruns and nonunion writers to keep shows on the air while talks continue between the Writers Guild of America and the program makers, the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers. But the strike may do more damage to new production of &quot;pilot&quot; programs for the networks if the dispute continues.    Negotiators for both sides were scheduled to meet with a federal mediator at 10 a.m. PST, today, in Los Angeles, to discuss the strike. Several kinds of shows may be hit soonest: daytime soap operas, late-night programs on five nights a week and daily game shows. But the NBC, ABC and CBS networks claimed the strike would have little immediate impact, and a union official for the most part agreed.    Most network soaps have one to two weeks of shows already taped. &quot;Viewers aren't suddenly going to be watching a black screen,&quot; said Mona Mangan, executive director of the East Coast arm of the guild. If the strike continues, she expects the networks, which own the soaps and don't use reruns, to pull in &quot;scab writers&quot; and use producers in writing tasks.    In late-night programs, &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; may feel the first hit. Guest host Jay Leno was scheduled to go on last night with material written before the strike. A Carson rerun was set for today, said a spokesman for General Electric Co.'s National Broadcasting Co. If the strike lasts, the rest of the week will use &quot;Best of Carson&quot; reruns, which the network insists on calling encores, the NBC spokesman said.    Likewise with NBC's &quot;Late Night with David Letterman,&quot; the spokesman said. Reruns were scheduled for this week even before the strike, and NBC will use more Letterman reruns beginning next Tuesday, when a new show was to air, if the strike continues. &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; will be pre-empted this Saturday and will use a rerun next week if the strike goes on.    NBC expects no impact on news programming, since its news writers are covered by a union that struck and settled last year.    The strike may affect CBS Inc. news somewhat more because the guild's contract covers about 50 &quot;producer/writers.&quot; These employees are on strike as writers, but not when it comes to their producing tasks, officials said. A CBS spokesman said other producers will fill in.    Despite the delayed impact, the Writers Guild chose to strike anyway. One big issue: producers want a big reduction in what writers earn when one-hour series reruns are sold in syndication. The per-episode prices that local stations pay for one-hour dramas have plunged because the reruns don't fare as well as half-hour comedies do.    Ms. Mangan of the guild pegged the producers' proposed reduction at 40% to 70% in writer fees. Writers can earn as much as $16,000 on a syndicated show; that would drop to $9,000 under a new plan.    Nor does the strike seem likely to cripple TV's highest-rated game show, &quot;Wheel of Fortune,&quot; which airs five nights a week on more than 200 stations. Its verbal content consists of contestants trying to guess a phrase by asking things like &quot;Is there an 'R'?&quot; and host Pat Sajak answering yes or no.    Said a spokeswoman for King World Productions Inc., which syndicates the show: &quot;Wheel doesn't employ writers.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
