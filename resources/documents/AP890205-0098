The Petroleum Intelligence Weekly said its latest survey of worldoil production showed that at least five members of the Organizationof Petroleum Exporting Countries exceeded their quotas last month,pushing production beyond the 18.5 million barrels pledged at ameeting last November.   The new quota was to have taken effect Jan. 1 and extend for sixmonths in an effort to stabilize world prices, which slumped to near1986 lows last year because of a massive oversupply of oil.   The United Arab Emirates was said to be the biggest offender, butother major exporters also overproduced, including Saudi Arabia,Kuwait, Iran and Qatar, the survey found.   The UAE, whose quota was set at 988,000 barrels a day, producedapproximately 1.5 million barrels, the PIW said.   However, Iranian output at about 2.7 million barrels a day``could have important ramifications, since some in OPEC had thoughtTehran would only produce about 2.5 million (barrels), 150,000barrels under its quota, thereby offsetting the impact of UAEexcesses,'' the report said.   Last year, OPEC production averaged 19.6 million barrels a day,according to the PIW, an 11 percent rise from 1987 and the highestlevel since 1982, exceeding the 1986 average of 18.4 million barrelsa day.   Between January and December 1988, OPEC production soared morethan 5 million barrels, from 17.3 million to 22.7 million, whilenon-OPEC production remained flat, the survey showed.   The report also indicated fourth-qyarter demand for oil byconsuming nations, including the United States, was due in part totemporary factors, such as weather, and might not continue as strongin 1989.</TEXT></DOC>
