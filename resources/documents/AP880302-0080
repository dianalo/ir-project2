JohnDanforth.   Meanwhile, Rep. Jack Buechner, R-Mo., has introduced legislationthat would require casks used by the DOE to ship radioactive wasteto meet safety standards set by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.   Danforth, R-Mo., said Tuesday the DOE has agreed to stop theshipments from Pennsylvania to a laboratory in Idaho Falls, Idaho,until the investigation is completed. He said he didn't know howlong the probe would take to complete.   Danforth, ranking minority member of the Senate Commerce,Science and Transportation Committee, last week requested theinvestigation into whether there were violations of railregulations Feb. 9 when a mislabeled car was added to a Conrailtrain carrying casks of radioactive wastes.   The covered hopper car carried a placard stating it contained aflammable material, Federal Railroad Administration spokesman BillLoftus said last week. It was later discovered the car was notcarrying the dangerous cargo.   Loftus said the investigation is looking at possible violationsby the rail switching yard and the Union Pacific Railroad, whichoperated the train after it left the yard, and a lime company thatwas shipping the car.   Danforth said Tuesday the DOE had agreed to allow the Departmentof Transportation to make a complete study of the routes used totransport the TMI material. The Energy Department has done suchstudies in the past but has always concluded that the route fromPennsylvania to Idaho was the best.   A request by Danforth not to move rail shipments in the St.Louis area between the hours of 6:30 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. and 3:30p.m. and 6:30 p.m. _ commuter rush hours _ also was agreed to bythe DOE.   Other agreements by the DOE included a promise not to add carsto TMI trains along the route. The trains, which leave Pennsylvaniaunder Conrail power, will continue to switch to Union Pacific whennecessary but no cars will be added, Danforth said.   As a way to minimize the total number of shipments, all futureshipments will be consolidated into three casks, Danforth said.   According to a statement by Danforth's office, other agreementsmade by the DOE include:</TEXT><TEXT>   _ Union Pacific will assign a certified hazardous materialsinspector at the East St. Louis, Ill., yard to assist withmechanical inspections and managers will be assigned at crew changepoints, inspection points and en route to monitor speed and timesof day schedules through St. Louis.</TEXT><TEXT>   _ The DOE will post a health physicist on each TMI train.</TEXT><TEXT>   _ An FRA official will accompany each TMI train to monitorspeed, schedules and track and equipment. The Energy Departmentalso will provide additional emergency response training to St.Louis and state officials.   Buechner's legislation, introduced Monday, would remove anexemption that allows the DOE to make nuclear waste shipmentswithout NRC safety inspections.   The energy department has contended that casks it uses to shipradioactive waste and spent nuclear fuels, including the TMIshipments, will withstand even the most extraordinary transportionaccident.</TEXT></DOC>
