Lines of weathered columns gleam golden against green date-palms.Hundreds more lie buried in the sand, along with piles of huge stoneblocks dating back 1,800 years to a time when Palmyra was the centerof a kingdom on desert caravan routes.   ``If we brought in bulldozers, we could clear the site in sixmonths, but we'd also destroy much evidence needed to assess thecity's role in history,'' said archaeologist Khaled Assad, the sitedirector.   ``Doing it slowly means another generation of work by Syrian andforeign excavators. ... But we'll also be restoring as much of theancient city as possible.''   Polish, French, West German, East German and Japanesearchaeologists are digging in different areas of Palmyra.   Syria, where human habitation has been traced back 150,000 years,is an archaeological treasure house of the remnants of countlesscivilizations that have flourished and fallen throughout its history.   About half of ancient Palmyra, about 4{ square miles, has beenunearthed.   It's Syria's top tourist attraction, drawing more than 70,000visitors a year.   Palmyra was important because it was the hub of the network ofcaravan trails that carried silks and spices from eastern Asiaacross the Roman province of Arabia to the Mediterranean.   But its rebellious Queen Zenobia challenged Rome's authority. Thecity was plundered in 272 A.D. after she was captured during a longsiege.   ``Palmyra is a unique site. ... It's a great responsibility andwe have to look after it, restoring the architecture, bringing itback to life,'' said Culture Minister Najar Attar.   This year, conservators finished renovating a 3,000-seatamphitheater overlooking a colonnaded main avenue where plays,concerts and youth festivals will be staged.   A tall arched portico forms the backdrop, flanked by deep-setdoorways and pillars made of limestone hauled from local quarries.   ``Palymra boasts very lively Roman architecture and its publicbuildings are superbly planned,'' said Asif Bahnassi, a recentlyretired director of antiquities who supervised the restoration.   ``We've re-erected more than 150 columns as well as many masonryblocks. ... You can feel the sense of spaciousness and grandeur.''   When excavations started in the 1930s the villagers of Palmyralived in the ruins of the huge temple of Bel, the Babylonianequivalent of Zeus, king of the Gods in Greek mythology.   They were resettled in a town that now has a population of 30,000.   The only modern building among the ruins is the 12-room HotelZenobia dating from 1918, mentioned in many Middle East travelers'memoirs.   But it's unlikely to be torn down because ``it happens to standin the courtyard of a temple to the rain god Belshamin and doesn'toverlie anything important,'' Assad said.   Last year, he said, Syrian archaeologists pulled 30 pieces ``ofreally beautiful statuary'' from an underground tomb dated around 98A.D.   In that period, wealthy Palmyrenes buried their relatives infamily tombs decorated with portraits of the deceased in sculptureand wall painting.   The excavators are still looking for a likeness of Queen Zenobia.   ``She doesn't appear in the archaeological record although wehave a good deal of information about her. ... Her career wasrecorded in detail by Roman historians,'' Assad said.   The site of her palace has been identified, but a later Romanemperor, Diocletian, razed its remains and built a military campthere some 30 years after the city was captured.   In the 3rd century, Palmyra won tax breaks from the Romans thathelped boost its commercial importance.   In addition to its markets for luxury goods, the city operated anetwork of caravan hostelries at 15-mile intervals _ equivalent to aday's journey. Palmyrene merchants owned ships that sailed in thePersian Gulf.   But Zenobia provoked imperial anger by asserting the city'sindependence after her Arab husband, Odeinat, died.   ``She was very ambitious for her son, Wahballat, but she was alsoa strong personality in her own right,'' Assad said.   Called ``the most beautiful woman in the Orient,'' she wore Romanpurple and addressed her troops on horseback like an emperor oncampaign. She followed political developments in Rome and hired aGreek philosopher, Longinus, as an adviser.   Zenobia was seized by the Romans near the Euphrates river, whileriding a camel to seek help against the Emperor Aurelian's siege ofPalmyra.   According to some historians, she was taken to Rome where shemarried a Roman senator and lived in a villa at Tivoli.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Mon PMs June 19</NOTE></DOC>
