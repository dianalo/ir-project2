The president isunlikely to announce that package immediately, however.;   Basic policyunchanged; Despite the planned expansion of humanitarian assistance, officialssaid the administration will not alter its basic policy on long-term economicaid to the Soviets. The White House has kept long-term commitments, such asbig investments in Soviet industrial projects, to a minimum, arguing that suchaid would be wasted unless the Soviets embark on more extensive economic andpolitical reforms.;   The proposed acceleration of humanitarian aid, which isbeing planned by senior White House officials, comes as Congress and theEuropean allies are beginning to push for an expansion of Western assistancethat was in the works before the aborted coup.;   At an economic summitmeeting held in London in July, the Western powers had offered only limitedeconomic aid to the Soviet Union, and critics charged that Gorbachev wasweakened politically when he returned from London almost empty-handed.;   OnCapitol Hill, key Democrats, led by House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt,D-Mo., are planning to advance their own package of increased aid. But Bush'snew program would almost certainly pre-empt the Democrats, depriving them ofpolitical advantage they might seek from the Soviet crisis.;   &quot;The politicsof Soviet aid have changed&quot; overnight, said a senior administration official.&quot;So I think the likelihood that we will be more aggressive in terms of foodand humanitarian assistance is very high.&quot;;   On Wednesday, the National CornGrowers Association called on the Bush administration to expedite theallocation of agricultural export credit guarantees and consider grantingadditional humanitarian food assistance. The group, a national commodityorganization with 25,000 members in 45 states, also urged Congress to givespeedy approval to the pending U.S.-Soviet trade agreement, which would extendmost-favored-nation trade status to the Soviets.;   Food for stability; &quot;Thepeople of the Soviet Union have taken the ultimate challenge in demonstratingtheir dedication to reform by standing against the coup,&quot; the group'spresident, Jack Kintzle, a Coggon, Iowa, farmer, said. &quot;These steps from ourgovernment will not only help alleviate food shortages in the USSR, but willprovide stability in the society that will aid the democratic reforms.&quot;;  While the administration does not plan to propose new non-humanitarian aidprograms, some proposals already moving through Congress, notably a Bush planto provide the Soviets with roughly $20 million in U.S. technical assistance,may be accelerated.;   No long-term investment; But a senior administrationofficial said that &quot;unless there is starvation in the streets this fall,&quot; theUnited States will not try to expand long-term investments until Gorbachev andYeltsin push through reforms that move the Soviet Union on a more direct pathtoward a market economy.;   Some administration officials are still concernedthat a large-scale aid package that goes beyond simple food and humanitarianassistance would reduce incentives for the Soviets to convert theirmilitary-industrial complex over to production of badly needed consumer goods.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Los Angeles Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  WASHINGTON  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910822  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  August  </MONTH><PG.COL>  16A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  616  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday, August 22, 199100235112,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
