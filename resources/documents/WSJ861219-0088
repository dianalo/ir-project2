The sale will result in a special charge of about $26 million in the fourth quarter, Bow Valley said.    Bow Valley, an oil and gas company, said it will use proceeds to reduce debt. The company's long-term debt totaled $393.4 million at Sept. 30. The company said the sale is part of a plan to focus its operations on exploration and development of oil and gas properties in Canada, the North Sea and Indonesia.    The sale is subject to completion of financing arrangements by Great Western, an oil and gas concern, and approval by Great Western's holders. The sale is expected to close on Dec. 31.    Daryl Seaman, Bow Valley's chairman and president, said last month that the company planned to sell its natural resource assets in the U.S.    Bow Valley's U.S. reserves are about 29 million barrels of oil, 61 billion cubic feet of natural gas, and 92 million tons of coal.    In the year-earlier fourth quarter, Bow Valley earned $126.5 million, or $3.11 a share, including a one-time gain of $118.9 million. </TEXT></DOC>
