British Aerospace said that after it acquired the government's99.8 percent stake in the automaker, the government would make acash injection of 800 million pounds, or $1.49 billion, into Roverto cover the car maker's debt.   British Aerospace said the acquisition is conditional onapproval of the cash injection by the European Commission, and onthe approval of British Aerospace shareholders.   Rover's board of directors said it welcomed the agreement.   British Aerospace said it ``intends to hold and develop theprincipal businesses of the Rover Group.''   The group is made up of the Austin Rover carmaker and the LandRover utility vehicle maker. It sold off its Leyland truckoperations last year.   The government took over the automaker, then called BritishLeyland, in 1975 to prevent its collapse. It sold off Jaguar PLC,the luxury automaker, in July 1984.   British Aerospace agreed to make unspecified payments to thegovernment if it decides to sell any of Rover's principalbusinesses as going concerns.   Rover recently announced trading profit, or profit before taxand interest charges, of 27.9 million pounds, or $52 million, for1987. That compared with a trading loss of 355.6 million pounds, or$661 million, in 1986.   British Aerospace said it also intends to purchase the remaining0.2 percent of Rover shares, which are held by private investors.The company will detail the terms of that offer to the privateshareholders after it secures the other approvals.   British Aerospace said it values Rover's existing productionagreements with the Japanese automaker, Honda Motor Co., and``wishes to build upon that relationship.''   Rover Chairman Graham Day said the British Aerospace deal``offers a speedy route to privatization with the minimumdisruption to our management, work force, dealer networks andsuppliers.''   Trade Secretary Lord Young had announced in March that BritishAerospace had shown a serious interest in acquiring Rover, whichthe government previously had said it intended to privatize.
