Dixon had all the trappings of success: aCalifornia beach house, trips to European spas, a $5 million inart, Rolls Royces and $110 perfume bottles for his wife.   He traveled on corporate jets, relaxed on a corporate yacht,entertained politicians. Dixon's salary and benefits ran in themillions.   Federal officials say that the ``indulgent and opulentlifestyle,'' right down to the perfume, was financed by the savingsbank Dixon owned, Vernon Savings and Loan.   Ultimately, however, the U.S. government paid. Vernon Sandamp;L wasdeclared hopelessly insolvent and was closed. It cost the FederalSavings and Loan Insurance Corp. more than $1.3 billion to pay offVernon's depositors _ making it one of the biggest bailouts in U.S.history and about the same size as the Chrysler Corp. rescue.   Dixon faces a civil suit accusing him of falsifying financialstatements and ``systematic looting and wasting the assets'' ofVernon, which was named for a small Texas town. He's moved toCalifornia, filed for personal bankruptcy protection, denied theaccusations in court but declined to answer questions beforeregulators.   Two former Vernon vice presidents and a former president havepleaded guilty to various bank fraud charges and agreed tocooperate with prosecutors. One has even admitted hiringprostitutes for a board meeting. Dixon, authorities say, is a toptarget of the most extensive white-collar criminal investigation inJustice Department history.   And Don Dixon is something more: an example of the roots of theU.S. savings and loan crisis.   While the Sandamp;L catastrophe has been triggered by the downfall ofthe Southwest economy, it has been exaggerated by the high-flyingantics of ``entrepreneurs'' in Texas, California and other stateswho, either through fraud, mismanagement or bad decisions, createdbillion-dollar messes.   ``For some few unscrupulous individuals, it was simply anaccepted way of doing business,'' said Marvin Collins, the U.S.attorney for north Texas. ``That small percentage had a tremendousimpact.''   About one-sixth of the nation's 3,000 Sandamp;Ls were insolvent at theend of 1987. They stretched from Alaska to Florida; Texas had 128.Most were well-managed institutions that fell on hard times,regulators say. But as Congress tries to save the industry creditedwith financing the American dream of home ownership, it has becomeincreasingly clear that the Sandamp;L story is not simply one of aneconomic downturn.   Without the fraud, ``you don't have the problem you havetoday,'' said M. Danny Wall, chairman of the Federal Home Loan BankBoard and the nation's chief Sandamp;L regulator. ``There are othersbesides Vernon that will prove to have been fraudulent.''   And there's more. Regulators themselves have been called on thecarpet by congressional committees and others for failing to watchover the industry.   The federal regulatory staff in California fell from 200 to 40in the early 1980s. The Southwest office lost most of its staffwhen it moved from Little Rock, Ark., to Dallas. Some Texas Sandamp;Lsdidn't have audits for three years. Questions were raised aboutVernon in 1983, but nothing was done because of insufficient staff,regulators say.   Texas regulators were also stranded when the state Legislatureredirected fees from savings and loans to help balance the generalbudget, a governor's task force found.   ``There was no one looking after the shop,'' said bankinganalyst Frank Anderson of D. Latin andamp; Co. ``The people inWashington, before Danny Wall came (in 1987), had no clue.''   Sandamp;L executives, including Tom Wageman, chairman of SunbeltSavings in Dallas, blame a series of rules changes for causinghavoc and opening the dirty dealings door.   Even the cleanup has been troubled.   _ For months after the problems were discovered, losses for theindustry continued at the rate of $1 million an hour because theFSLIC didn't have enough money to close down the insolvent thrifts.   _ Healthy institutions must pay special assessments to cover thelosses _ a policy one leading Sandamp;L banker has dubbed ``vampireeconomics.''   _ Wall's ``Southwest Plan'' was scheduled to sell or close atleast two insolvent Sandamp;Ls a week, but in its first six monthshandled only a handful.   _ Some in Congress have complained the bank board has beenhanding out the few billions it does have without proper debate.   ``It is incomprehensible to me that a sense of crisis has yet todevelop around this issue,'' said Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., aHouse Banking Committee member.   And not everyone is convinced the questionable practices haveended.   ``I originally predicted that the bulk of this activity washistorical,'' said Collins, the federal prosecutor.``Unfortunately, I think there is still some of it going on.''</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
