Discrepancy of temperature dependences for NbH/sub 0.18/alloy suggests nonequivalence of phase transformations during heatingand cooling. In the process of heating ({alpha}+{beta}) -andgt; ({alpha}+{alpha}')-andgt; {alpha} transitions takes place, in the process of cooling the sequenceof phase transformations corresponds to equilibrium phase diagram ofNb-H system.</TEXT></DOC>
