The 550-pound animal had a week-old bullet wound in its neck anddied after coming out from under anesthesia administered so wildlifeagents could examine him and attach a radio transmitter.   The wound and an infestation of lung worms ``may have compromisedhis ability ... to withstand the anesthesia,'' said Bob DeLong, amarine mammal biologist with the National Marine Fisheries Service.   ``Using anesthesia on the animal was one of the risks that wentalong with studying them,'' he said.   DeLong said the wounded sea lion may have been shot by someonefrustrated by the animals continued presence at the Ballard Lockswhich the migrating fish use from January until spring.   ``I'm afraid we're going to see more and more shootings,'' DeLongsaid.   About 20 sea lions, which migrate from southern California andMexico, have stopped at the locks to feast on salmon and steelheadtrout migrating from the Pacific Ocean through Puget Sound to thefresh water lakes and rivers of western Washington.   The other sea lion captured Wednesday was taken 250 miles to thesouthwest Washington coast where it was to be released Thursday, asagents tried to capture more sea lions.   The wounded sea lion had probably been shot near the locks, whichare in an urban area surrounded by docks and homes, DeLong said.   DeLong said a .22-caliber bullet wound was found lodged in thethroat of the sea lion, who was sick before he was trapped in thefloating cage agents are using in the removal program, called``Operation Goodbye.''   This is the fifth year officials have tried to keep a growingnumber of sea lions away from the locks. Protective nets, taperecordings of killer whales, firecrackers and foul-tasting chemicalshave all proved ineffective.   DeLong said sea lions are protected from shooting by federal law,and Congress last year rejected an option to allow managers of theanimals to use lethal methods to control them.   Ben Deeble of the environmental group Greenpeace, which hasmonitored the removal efforts and given tentative approval,questioned whether it was necessary to anesthetize the animals.   He said he would support simply transporting the animals andmarking them with paint rather than attaching radio transmitters inorder to determine whether the removed sea lions return to the locks.   Wildlife officials plan to capture at least a half dozen animalsand haul them to the Long Beach Peninsula, then monitor theirmovement.   Last year, sea lions ate an estimated 1,800 of the wildsteelhead, a sea-going rainbow trout favored by anglers, and onlyabout 850 of them made it back to their spawning gravel, said BobByrne, spokesman for the state Department of Wildlife.   This year's run of steelhead was about 1,650 at the fish ladder,down from about 2,600 last year, officials said last month.</TEXT></DOC>
