TROTT</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Rules for humane treatment of laboratoryanimals adopted by this city will serve as a rallying point forprotection campaigns elsewhere, says an animal rights activist.   The ordinance, adopted unanimously Monday evening by theCambridge City Council, will affect vertebrates used in studies atHarvard University, Massachusetts Institution of Technology and 11other academic institutes and private research firms.   The council put teeth in the guidelines by creating acommissioner's post to oversee and enforce the regulations.   ``A gaping loophole in the federal law is now closed,'' Gul Agha,who initiated the legislation three years ago when he was aresearcher at MIT, said after the vote.   Agha, who teaches computer science at Yale University, said thatas a researcher he saw lab animals subjected to insufficientventilation, physicial abuse, rusted cages and starvation.   Agha estimated that animal research is a $100 million-a-yearbusiness in Cambridge, and said about 60,000 animals annually arethe subject of experiments.   The vote Monday marked the first time a local jurisdiction hasordered such far-reaching regulations on animal experimentation,according to the Cambridge Committee for Responsible Research Inc.   Grassroots groups have begun organizing campaigns for similarmeasures in Amherst, Mass., San Francisco and Berkeley, Calif., Aghasaid.   Researchers in general have not fought the ordinance, maintainingthat they already comply with state and federal regulations.   ``Cambridge institutions are now carrying out high quality animalcare,'' said Dr. John Moses, chairman of the animal care committeeat MIT. ``Involvement by the city will help prevent furthermisunderstandings about the nature of that care by ... increasingpublic accountability.''   The newly adopted legislation expands federal and stateregulations concerning humane treatment of laboratory animals byincluding all vertebrates. A vertebrate is any animal with abackbone or spinal column, including mammals, fish, birds andreptiles.   Current federal law deals with dogs, cats and monkeys andexcludes reptiles, amphibians, mice, rats and rabbits, said StevenWise, an animal rights attorney. In 1987, the mayor named Wise alongwith a physician and a veterinarian to come up with recommendationsnow contained in the ordinance. The panel inspected several researchlaboratories in Cambridge and found no significant animal abuse.   The position of commissioner of laboratory animals created by theordinance can make unannounced visits to research sites, conducthearings and impose fines of $300 per day, per violation.</TEXT></DOC>
