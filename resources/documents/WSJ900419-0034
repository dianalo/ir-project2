Revenue rose 7% to $2.84 billionfrom $2.65 billion.   Analysts said they were expecting a strong quarter fromApple but that the results exceeded even those expectations.The key appears to have been Apple's ability to wrench itsprofit margins up to a &quot;spectacular 55%, which has to be arecord or a near record,&quot; said Steven Ossad , a computeranalyst with Montgomery Securities in San Francisco.   The good news, however, was tempered by Apple's forecast,delivered to analysts during a conference call on Wednesday,that its profit margins would fall from those elevated levelsin the second half of fiscal 1990.   The company also told analysts that it expects combinedsecond half domestic and international growth rates to be amodest 7% to 10%. Indeed, despite the second-quarter showing,Apple's stock closed unchanged at $43.25 a share yesterday onvolume of 1.7 million shares in national over-the-countertrading.   Apple said its results were greatly aided by recordinternational sales, which totaled 47% of all sales for thequarter, which also set a record. Apple attributed theincrease to aggressive overseas marketing efforts coupledwith &quot;the relatively higher growth rates the industry isexperiencing in markets outside the United States.&quot;   Indeed, Apple said that while it remains &quot;cautious&quot; aboutgrowth in the U.S. computer industry in coming quarters, &quot;weare optimistic regarding the level of international demand.&quot;   Apple said profit also received a boost from improvedmargins on its computer products, stemming from lower partscosts and a more effective program of managing operatingexpenses.   The company added that results were aided by brisk salesof upgraded models of its mid- and high-end Macintoshcomputer introduced last year. The machines, notably theMacintosh FE 30, 2ci and 2cx, retail between about $3,800 to$8,600 depending upon the configuration.</TEXT></DOC>
