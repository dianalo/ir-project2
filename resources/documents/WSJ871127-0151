Burlington Holdings Inc., which completed the leveraged buy-out of Greensboro, N.C.-based Burlington Industries in September, said it will prepay $235 million of its bank term loan incurred in connection with the $2.16 billion buy-out.    Dominion, Canada's largest textile producer, said the acquisition of the plant, Burlington's largest denim-making facility, will be financed initially by short-term loans from Royal Bank of Canada and Toronto-Dominion Bank.    Dominion and New York investor Asher Edelman made an unsuccessful hostile bid for Burlington earlier this year, which led to the leveraged buy-out. In a leveraged buy-out, a small group of investors acquires a company largely with debt that ultimately is paid with funds generated by the acquired company. </TEXT></DOC>
