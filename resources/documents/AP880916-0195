Meyer Steinberg, a chemical engineer and coal expert at theBrookhaven National Laboratory in New York, proposed to the SenateEnvironment and Public Works Committee a new technical option forlong-term consideration, ``a hydrogen economy based on coal'' madepossible by Brookhaven research.   Energy experts have eyed hydrogen for decades as a possible fuelwhen the world can no longer burn petroleum. Though hydrogen is anextremely dangerous gas to handle, burning it simply produces wateras a combustion product. Liquid hydrogen has been used as a rocketfuel.   Most methods of making hydrogen also produce carbon dioxide, theprincipal gas among several whose increasing concentration in theatmosphere, according to some climatologists, is causing the earthto warm by a half-degree Fahrenheit per decade. These scientistssay the warming will raise sea levels and shift rainfall patternsto make drought in the central United States more likely, accordingto many climatologists.   Some analysts have speculated that hydrogen would have to beproduced from the decomposition of water using nuclear or some formof solar energy, or electricity from water flowing over dams. Theseenergy sources leave no carbon dioxide behind.   ``We have developed a very efficient process'' to produce ahydrogen-rich gas from coal, said Steinberg. ``We are suggestingthat coal refineries be built based on this process.''   Steinberg offered few details of the process he called``hydro-carb,'' which he said was originally developed to producecarbon black, a pure form of carbon important in producing tiresand in segments of the chemical industry. Carbon black now is madefrom petroleum or natural gas.   The carbon produced by the new process, he suggested, couldsimply be stored and ``used as a clean fuel'' if carbon dioxideemissions from combustion could be tolerated. ``All impuritieswould already be removed,'' he said.   Steinberg said such a strategy would have severe costs, ``butprobably not any more severe than going all the way to the nuclearoption.''   Direct removal of carbon dioxide from smokestacks is possible,he said, ``But what are we going to do with gigatons (billions oftons) of carbon dioxide?''   Steinberg and a colleague, Hsing Cheng, calculated in 1986 thatdirect removal of carbon dioxide from utility smokestacks would beso costly that the price of electricity could double, the projectwould consume 11 percent to 16 percent of the electrical capacityof the nation and could require a pipeline network to dispose ofliquid carbon dioxide on the ocean floor that would need aninvestment of $284 billion in 1980 dollars or about $330 billiontoday.   A spokesman for the National Coal Association, John Grasser,said he had not heard of the Brookhaven development, ``but itsounds like an interesting process.''   Several techniques are already used to produce combustible gasfrom coal, generally yielding a mixture of hydrogen and carbonmonoxide with a heating value from 10 percent to 30 percent ofnatural gas. Burning these gases yields carbon dioxide from thecarbon monoxide.   Coal accounts for about 80 percent of the carbon dioxideemissions from electricity generation in the United States. Thecommittee is considering a bill that would require new fossil powerplants to double fuel efficiency after 2010, cars to reduce carbondioxide emissions by 75 percent after that date, all new furnacesand water heaters in five years to equal the performance of today'sbest and all new air conditioners to double their efficiency infive years.   The committee released an analysis by the Office of TechnologyAssessment concluding that actions called for by the bill until2010 would be possible with today's technlogies, but after that newtechnology would be needed unless society is prepared to acceptnuclear power.</TEXT></DOC>
