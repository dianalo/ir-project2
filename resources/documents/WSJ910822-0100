Long-term bond prices rose modestly, but short-termTreasury securities lost ground as relieved investorsabandoned the safety of Treasury notes and bills for higheryields elsewhere. Similarly, the dollar lost its &quot;safe haven&quot;political support and tumbled against other major currenciesas the crisis passed.</LP><TEXT>   The big rally in stocks began in Europe as it becameincreasingly evident that the coup leaders were losing theirtenuous grip on power as a result of widespread defiance. Bythe time stocks opened for trading in New York, news reportshad the coup leaders fleeing Moscow.   The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose more than 50 pointsin the first hour. Later reports that Mikhail Gorbachev waspreparing to return to the Soviet capital pushed prices stillhigher.   The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 88.10 points to3001.79 in heavy trading. Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock indexadvanced 11.16 to 390.59. The Nasdaq Composite Index, ameasure of small stock prices, closed at a record 517.97 onyesterday's gain of 15.92 points.   The buying binge in stocks reflected hopes among investorsthat with the Soviet Union's crisis essentially resolved, theU.S. economic recovery, sluggish though it may be, willcontinue unimpeded. Among industry groups showing the biggestgains yesterday were apparel retailers, pollution controlconcerns, auto manufacturers and airlines. The biggest losersincluded energy and oil companies, as oil prices fell.   &quot;Although it was a scary 48 hours, the net result of allthis turns out to be positive in accelerating the favorabletrends that were already in place,&quot; said David Bostian, chiefeconomist at Josephthal andamp; Co. &quot;The only risk now is that ifthe Dow keeps up this pace and hits 3100 or 3200 in the nextfew weeks, we'll have gotten too far ahead of thefundamentals. But this all makes the outlook for 1992 verypositive.&quot;   Analysts said the failed coup may be just the catalyst thestock market has needed to break beyond the trading range inwhich it has been mired for six months. They said the triumphof reform forces in the Soviet Union could give consumerconfidence here a big boost. Coupled with expected furtherreductions in short-term interest rates in coming weeks, suchrenewed confidence would considerably reduce the chance of aso-called double dip recession.   &quot;Clearly, had the coup succeeded there might have been amore plausible case for a double dip recession,&quot; said Mr.Bostian. &quot;But if the Federal Reserve eases in the next fewweeks, as I expect them to, the prospects of a double dipdiminish to a very low probability.&quot;   Bond traders said the quick declines in short-termTreasury prices yesterday indicated that the flight toquality Monday was mostly among traders, not long-terminvestors. They said the attention of the bond market willrevert to domestic concerns now, including expectations offurther Fed easing.   The dollar took the biggest hit, falling more than 3%against the German mark. Traders attributed the decline torelief that the coup was over and the prospect of lower U.S.interest rates in weeks ahead.   Nonetheless, Richard Witten, partner in charge of currencysales at Goldman Sachs, predicted the U.S. currency will betrading higher -- at about 1.85 marks and 145 yen -- by yearend. The dollar will rise because &quot;the U.S. economy will bethe first major country out of recession,&quot; he said.&quot;Nothing's really changed from an economic perspectivebecause of the Soviet situation.&quot;   In major market action:                                                                                                          Stock prices soared in heavy trading. Volume on the NewYork Stock Exchange totaled 231.7 million shares. Advancingissues on the Big Board swamped decliners 1,478 to 268.                                                                                                          Bond prices rose modestly. The Treasury's benchmark30-year bond rose more than a quarter of a point, or $2.50for each $1,000 face amount. The yield on the issue fell to8.06%.                                                                                                          The dollar plunged, especially against the German mark.
