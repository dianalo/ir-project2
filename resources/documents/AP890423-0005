The rampages occurred Saturday as about 150,000 students andsupporters demonstrated in Beijing against the communist system.That protest, one of the biggest in Communist China's 40-yearhistory, ended peacefully.   The official Xinhua News Agency said that mobs in the ancientcity of Xian burned buildings and vehicles and injured 130 securityforces.   American sources and Chinese reports from Changsha said rioterssmashed store and car windows along the main street of the southerncity and beat up police.   Smaller protests also occurred in Shanghai, Nanjing and Tianjin.In Shanghai, student leaders said their universities warned them tostop protesting.   The demonstrations began early last week following the death ofousted Communist Party leader Hu Yaobang. His funeral was Saturdayin Beijing and the occasion of the massive student rally there.   Students have been demanding a radical changes in the structureof the communist system, including a free press and expanded humanrights.   In a related development, more than 200 leading intellectualssigned an open letter to the government supporting the studentdemands.   Hundreds of professors and teachers from dozens of Beijing'sleading universities previously signed an open letter that calledon the government not to take violent measures to quell theprotests.   Xinhua said the attack in Xian, provincial capital of Shaanxiprovince, began when tens of thousands of people, includingstudents, gathered in front of the provincial government compoundto listen to a broadcast of Hu's funeral service.   It said ``some lawbreakers from society'' began shoutinganti-government slogans and tried to force their way into thegovernment compound. In all, 130 security force members wereinjured, it said.   A British student said that when he arrived at Xincheng Squarein front of the government headquarters, about 50 youths werethrowing rocks at a truck carrying security forces.   ``The whole area was covered with people,'' he said. ``Some wereholding banners and standing peacefully but others were reallygoing crazy, ripping limbs off trees and throwing anything theycould at the police.''   The rioters set fire to several banners and tried to set fire tothe truck carrying the security forces, said the student, who spokeon condition of anonymity.   A Japanese student said most of the rock-throwing youths were``hooligans.'' He said police took at least 30 people away,including several students. Xinhua said 18 were arrested.   The Xinhua report said that soon after the violence began thestudents quickly left. Rioters, however, set fire to two rooms ofthe government compound and stoned a tourist bus carryingforeigners. The report did not identify the foreigners or say ifanyone was hurt.   The report said another protest began Saturday night and a mobpulled down a wall of the compound, set fire to an oil tank and agarage, and burned four vehicles. The rioters also burned two busesand robbed a garment store while fleeing police, according to thereport.   The report said security forces cleared the square but did notgive further details.   The British student said he returned to the area about 8:30 p.m.and that several hundred security forces with guns and riot helmetshad blocked access to the square.   ``Flames were coming from behind walls of the provincialgovernment,'' he said. ``The smell of smoke was everywhere.''   Riots also broke out in Changsha, the capital of Hunan provinceand Hu's home province.   Foreign sources said students commandeered a bus and truckduring a march by about 1,000 students from Hunan University to theprovincial government headquarters.   The sources said students carried wreaths for Hu but did notshout political or anti-government slogans.   After the students left campus, they were joined by thousands ofnon-students, including young street toughs who ``went wild'' andbegan breaking store windows, the sources said. The crowds fledwhen nine truckloads of security forces appeared, the sources said.   The state-run radio of Hunan province reported that ``lawlesselements'' had ``beat up and injured People's police, wrecked shopsand looted goods.''   Hu's death April 15 sparked a week of demonstrations. He losthis post as party chief in 1987 after being accused of being toosoft on students involved in pro-democracy demonstrations in1986-87.   In Tiananmen Square in Beijing, students faced about 8,000soldiers and shouted ``Down with dictatorship, down withcorruption!'' as top members of the Communist Party filed out ofHu's funeral.   Bedlam set in shortly after noon when authorities opened up thesquare to pedestrian traffic and the numbers swelled to more than200,000. Workers, unemployed youths and curious bystanders floodedthe well-organized student ranks.   Soldiers rushed the crowd once, although no injuries or arrestswere reported.   Student leaders ended the rally about 1 p.m., and only about10,000 people remained in the square three hours later.   Rioting has been rare since the Communists came to power in1949, except for the decade of the Cultural Revolution, which endedin 1976.   Over the past year, however, authorities have acknowledgedgrowing social unrest, including increased crime and strikes. Muchof the unrest has been attributed to economic problems, includinghigh inflation, shortages of goods, panic buying and profiteering.</TEXT></DOC>
