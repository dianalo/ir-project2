(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Federal regulators closed aminority-owned bank after they could not find a buyer for it.   The 5,100 people with insured accounts at Security National Bankwere told they could withdraw their money Monday, the FederalDeposit Insurance Corp. said.   ``The FDIC determined that a payoff of insured depositors wasrequired because no acceptable bids were received for the failedbank,'' the agency said in a statement issued late Saturday.   The FDIC closed the bank Friday but continued negotiationsSaturday with the only potential buyer. However, no deal wasreached.   The bank had assets of $19.4 million and about $18.5 million indeposits. Nearly all of that money was insured, the statement said.   Unsafe lending practices, inability to hire and keep capablemanagement and inadequate oversight by the board of directors wereamong the problems which led to Security National's demise, FDICofficial Robert Herrmann said.   ``The depressed local economy, to some extent, aggravated thebank's existing weaknesses,'' said Herrmann, senior deputycomptroller for bank supervision.</TEXT></DOC>
