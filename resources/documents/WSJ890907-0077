Dresdner Bank plans to raise 1.2 billion marks by issuing four million shares of common stock to shareholders at a rate of one for every eight held. The new shares, priced at 300 marks each, will be open for subscription in late October and early November.    Separately, Lufthansa, West Germany's government-controlled airline, said it plans to offer 6,080,000 shares of common stock at 155 marks a share, valuing the transaction at 942.2 million marks. Shareholders can draw one new share for every four held between Oct. 9 and Oct. 23. The asking price showed a 23% discount on the airline's closing share price of 200.5 marks on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange yesterday.    The West German government won't subscribe to the issue, meaning its Lufthansa stake will drop to 51.6% from 64.5%. Lufthansa said the airline needs cash to expand its fleet and ground services over the next decade.    Prior to Dresdner Bank's announcement, its shares fell 5.3 marks yesterday to close at 354 marks, meaning that the new stock will be issued at a 15% price discount. In unofficial off-floor trading later in the day, Dresdner Bank shares were changing hands at around 347 marks.    &quot;Their price is high and the market is reacting accordingly,&quot; said Werner Dort, a broker for Commerzbank AG. &quot;Everybody is talking about an impending market consolidation and the market has become a little cautious.&quot;    West German stock analysts say a prolonged technical recovery is long overdue as market indices continue to show postcrash highs. The German Stock Index eased 3.92 to 1633.55 yesterday, after two days of strong gains. Exchange-rate uncertainties and signs of an inflationary buildup in West Germany's brisk economy have fueled speculation of an impending hike in official West German interest rates. Since higher rates would hurt bank earnings by increasing refinancing costs, West German bank shares fell across the board yesterday in nervousness about today's meeting of the Bundesbank Central Bank Council.    Analysts were discomfited by the timing of Dresdner Bank's issue, still seven weeks away. &quot;It's a fairly long wait and much can happen between now and then,&quot; said Georg Siebenburgen, a bank analyst at the Bank in Liechtenstein's Frankfurt branch.    Dresdner Bank's stock issue would increase its nominal share capital by 200 million marks to 1.69 billion marks, thus keeping the bank's equity capital total in line with business growth. In a brief statement announcing the offering, Dresdner Bank said it was motivated by &quot;European strategy considerations,&quot; but didn't say whether the fresh capital would be used to finance an acquisition. </TEXT></DOC>
