Fault and interruption reports were usedto record the places at which faults occur, their causes and effectson energy production and the amount of time spent repairing them. Monthlysummaries monitored the energy production of plants, the use of fuels,maintenance and reserve times of the plant and monthly averages of thehumidity and other properties of the peat used. In this study the reportsfrom 3 milled peat power plants were analyzed and the limitations ofthe data collected during monitoring examined. The data were supplementedby interviews carried out at the plants. Peat combustion losses (as a% of energy produced) were 1.9% at plant 1, 0.5% at plant 2 and 1.2%at plant 3. Faults in the afterburning grate accounted for 54% of thelosses in peat combustion caused by plant equipment at plant 1, 39% atplant 2 and 39% at plant 3. 17 refs., 16 figs., 17 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
