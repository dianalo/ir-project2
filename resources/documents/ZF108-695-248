 Instead,consider one that contains only the pages an employee needs and that can bemade funny, serious, sarcastic, or philosophical, depending on the employee'sparticular mood that day.andM;Looking for a new way to make employees toe the line on expenses?andP;  Use anelectronic expense account report that automatically notifies the chieffinancial officer when the junior executive over-does it with the caviar andmartinis and spends more than the allotted $100 for lunch with a client.andM;Interleaf, the Cambridge, Mass.--based electronic-publishing company, ispromising that these applications, and dozens more, will soon be possiblebecause of a new software technology called active documents.andP;  The firm,which makes software for creating sophisticated documents and which includesmany Fortune 500 companies among its customers, has been billing the newtechnology as a &quot;major breakthrough.&quot;andM;Active documents, it says, will have the &quot;intelligence to access information,evaluate it, and act on it.&quot;andP;  No one, including Interleaf, is saying that thecompany has actually invented truly intelligent software with the ability tothink and make decisions.andM;Those who are familiar with prototypes of active-document technology,however, say it is not a gimmicky come-on but an important new step inelectronic publishing.andP;  These documents, even if they aren't intelligent,have a wonderful capacity to act as if they are because of the way they canbe programmed.andP;  In effect, they know their own contents.andP;  They can also beprogrammed to know who is looking at them.andM;&quot;What Interleaf is doing is pretty far-sighted,&quot; says Esther Dyson, theeditor and publisher of Release 1.0, a PC-industry newsletter.andP;  &quot;I hate touse the word unique, but call it unprecedented.&quot;andM;Other analysts and consultants are more cautious.andP;  &quot;It's not as if there wereno other smart documents,&quot; says Jeffrey Tarter, editor of Softletter, asoftware-industry newsletter, &quot;but Interleaf has taken the concept furtherthan anyone else.&quot;andM;Interleaf officially introduced its active-document technology in March atthe Seybold Seminars '90 in Boston.andP;  It whet the appetite of just abouteveryone who follows the electronic-publishing field.andP;  But its trueimportance won't be known until the software hits the marketplace in thefourth quarter.andP;  It is expected to run on all computers Interleaf supports,including Apple, Apollo, Digital Equipment, Hewlett-Packard, IBM (RISCSystem/6000 and 386-based personal computers), and Sun Microsystems.andM;&quot;I think it's a dynamite product,&quot; says Peter Schleider, a partner andanalyst at the investment banking firm of Wessels, Arnold andamp; Henderson inMinneapolis.andM;Embedded in active documents are specially written programs.andP;  The moresophisticated the programming, the more active documents can do.andP;  Once anactive document has been set up, it can be modified and reconfigured by auser without any programming skill.andP;  But to build an active document fromscratch requires professional programming knowledge.andP;  Interleaf will besending some customers a toolkit specifically geared for companies that wantto build active documents either with their professional programming staff orwith the help of an outside developer.andM;Depending on how you program it, says Interleaf, active-document technologycan be used to help an office worker prepare a lengthy, perfectly formatted,and error-free document for the federal government.andP;  It can be used to createan urgent memo that, in conjunction with voice-annotation software, announcesits presence when it is electronically mailed.andP;  The document canautomatically mail itself to the right people.andP;  It can be used to create aproposal that makes information inaccessible to those who don't have theproper security clearance.andP;  It can send a message to each person on a salesforce.andP;  Once the answer comes back, it can then automatically send out anupbeat reply if sales are up or a warning if they are down.andM;Active-document technology also works closely with 1-2-3.andP;  Data from aspreadsheet can be used to generate an Interleaf chart.andP;  If the informationin the spreadsheet is changed, the chart in the document is automaticallyupdated.andP;  Information from the spreadsheet can also be used, for example, togenerate an illustration in which, for example, the pieces of a bicycle aresized to reflect their manufacturing costs.andM;Amoco Corp.'s Houston site has been testing an alpha version of Interleaf'ssoftware customized by Amoco.andP;  The technology will help engineers through theunwieldy process of preparing construction-bid packages for equipment rangingfrom offshore oil platforms to entire gas plants.andP;  In the past, when atechnical question came up--for instance, about an industry standard for acertain design specification--there wasn't always a person on staff withenough expertise to answer it.andP;  Usually, the engineer preparing the packagehad to wade through volumes of material to find the answer.andP;  In many cases,company engineers were &quot;exceeding [standards] by so much it was costing us afortune,&quot; says David Scheulen, a staff analyst for Amoco who helpedcoordinate the company's new document process.andM;But with an active document, an engineer no longer has to rely on theexpertise of others, trudge to the corporate library, or interpret standardvalues without assistance.andP;  An Amoco engineer will be able to get virtuallyall the information he needs without leaving his PC.andM;The way the system has been programmed, the document automatically flags theengineer if he or she types in a value that is outside the accepted range fora given design specification.andP;  If he wants to find out what the choices arefor a design specification, he can click on a button within the document anda list of acceptable choices pops up.andP;  If he has a question about a value orwants to know what the industry standard is, he simply clicks on anotherbutton and the computer searches through a CD-ROM for pertinent information.andM;With the capability of calling up the standards on screen, engineers will beable to write bid packages that comply with all industry standards instead ofunnecessarily exceeding them.andP;  The net result, says Scheulen, is that Amocoexpects to save millions of dollars a year in construction costs.andM;Capabilities such as these are the reason some consultants are so bullishabout Interleaf's new product.andP;  Amy D. Wohl, an office-automation consultantretained by Interleaf to evaluate active documents, says the technologyfulfills a need to individually tailor and customize information.andP;  Instead ofgetting a letter that is filled with extraneous information, she envisionsactive documents automatically creating one that has only the informationabsolutely necessary to the person reading it.andP;  She is also intrigued by thenotion of using active documents in the classroom to create an individualizedelectronic textbook for each student.andP;  &quot;Such books can be dynamicallycustomized based upon a student's records, his or her answers to aquestionnaire, or how the student answered test questions as he or sheproceeded through the book,&quot; says Wohl, whose company is based in BalaCynwyd, Pa.andM;&quot;It's a pretty sexy product,&quot; says Wohl.andP;  &quot;I get to see a lot of stuff, and Idon't get excited too often.&quot;andM;Gerald Michalski, director of the Intelligent Document Management ResearchService, a Mountain View, Calif., firm that provides research services forclients on advanced information technology, wasn't quite as ecstatic becauseactive documents aren't yet on the market.andP;  But he is definitely intrigued.andO;The ability to publish a good-looking document isn't enough anymore, saysMichalski.andP;  &quot;You have to add some rules, some ability to do reasoning.&quot;andM;If active documents can actually do all the wonderful things that Interleafpromises, he will be delighted.andP;  Says Michalski: &quot;This is the kind of stuffwe're looking for.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
