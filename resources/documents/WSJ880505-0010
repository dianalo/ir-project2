The unexpected cancellation of the strike-contingency agreement follows strenuous efforts by Eastern to defend the arrangement in court and before a congressional committee. Loss-plagued Eastern made the arrangement as part of its efforts to brace for a strike by its machinists union.    Orion, a contract carrier which formerly flew for United Parcel Service, had agreed to replace Eastern pilots if they followed the machinists on a walkout. The arrangement with Orion was scotched, at least temporarily, in March when a federal judge barred Eastern from training replacement pilots on company aircraft until a strike occurred.    But yesterday, Frank Lorenzo, the chairman of Eastern and its Houston-based parent, Texas Air Corp., asserted that Eastern had received indications from the pilots' union that &quot;there isn't any support&quot; for the machinists' position -- suggesting that the pilots might not honor picket lines by the machinists.    Mr. Lorenzo characterized the Orion pact as an &quot;insurance policy Eastern entered into when it needed insurance.&quot;    A spokesman for the pilots said the union has never stated whether it would engage in a sympathy strike if the machinists' talks break down. &quot;It sounds to me as though they are trying to put a bright face on the fact that they lost in court,&quot; said a pilots' union spokesman.    Despite the compay's withdrawal from the Orion agreement, the company's interest in slashing labor costs remains as high as ever. Mr. Lorenzo, speaking to reporters in Washington, said that Eastern would continue to incur &quot;very sizable continued losses&quot; in the second quarter.    Texas Air hasn't yet reported first-quarter earnings, but Eastern's bookings have been depressed by the strike threats and a plane-by-plane investigation by the Federal Aviation Administration, which also includes Texas Air's Continental Airlines unit. Last year, Texas Air posted a $466 million deficit, including a $130.8 million loss at Eastern.    In composite trading on the American Stock Exchange, Texas Air closed yesterday at $10.875 a share, down 12.5 cents.    Eastern still has strike contingency plans under way. In disclosures with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Continental said it had been paid $22 million by Eastern to &quot;provide services in the event of a strike.&quot; In addition, Eastern flight attendants have each received two days' training on Continental aircraft and procedures, a representative of the union said recently.    The unions, meanwhile, plan to continue fighting Eastern's strike preparations in court. An attorney for the pilots said that the discovery process was under way to determine whether Eastern's strike-preparation agreement with Continental violated the court's injunction in the Orion case. Orion is a unit of Primark Corp. of McLean, Va.    &quot;We think the order is as clear as a bell,&quot; said James L. Linsey, an attorney in the New York firm of Cohen, Weiss andamp; Simon. &quot;If we learn. . .that they are violating the order, we will present a motion to hold them in contempt.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
