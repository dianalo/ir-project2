(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Avianca Flight 52's declaration of a fuelshortage was relayed from regional traffic controllers tocontrollers handling its approach, but the urgency of the warningwasn't clear, authorities said Monday.   The controllers were not told by the pilot that there was anemergency, Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Fred Farrarsaid from Washington.   Farrar said the word used was ``priority,'' which ``has noparticular meaning in air traffic control. If there is anemergency, you use the `word emergency.'''   The FAA report conflicts with information provided Sunday nightby the National Transportation Safety Board, which said theregional controllers had not relayed word of the fuel shortage tothe local controllers.   The Boeing 707 fell powerless into a secluded neighborhood ofCove Neck on New York's Long Island on Thursday night, killing 73of 159 people aboard, including the cockpit crew. More than 20survivors remained hospitalized in critical condition Monday.   Inspection of the crash site on a wooded hillside was nearlycomplete Monday, and investigators focused on conversations of thecrew and controllers.   The investigators said tapes show the crew warned a regionalcontrol center that it was low on fuel about 45 minutes before thecrash, as it was circling over New Jersey in a holding pattern.   The jet flew in three weather-related holding patterns totalingnearly 90 minutes along the East Coast as it flew from Colombia toNew York City's John F. Kennedy Airport.   ``We think we may need priority,'' a crew member told thecontrol center about 8:45 p.m., according to preliminarytranscripts, Farrar said Monday.   A regional controller replied, ``How long can you hold beforeyou have to go to your alternate?'' The alternate landing site wasBoston.   ``Wait a minute,'' the cockpit replied, pausing apparently tocheck, the FAA said. ``We can hold five minutes.'' Shortlythereafter, the cockpit said its alternate site was ``Boston. Ican't make it.''   At that time, the FAA said, the regional controller telephonedthe control center that handles approaches and departures forKennedy.   The regional controller said Avianca 52 had just come out of theholding area ``and can only do five more minutes of hold. Can youtake him now?''   The local control replied, ``Slow him to 180 knots and I willtake him.''   After the call, the plane was released to Kennedy airport and itmade a landing attempt 37 minutes later through rain and fog, butaborted the approach because it was coming in too steeply,authorities said.   Investigators say the Avianca crew agreed to a controller'ssuggestion that the plane loop back over Long Island and come infor a second attempt. It did so, the cockpit saying twice it waslow on fuel, but the engines soon quit and the plane crashed.Investigators are looking at the fuel shortage as a cause.   NTSB investigators Monday were interviewing regional controllersand Kennedy tower controllers to determine the extent of theirknowledge of the fuel problems, and what was done about it.   Asked about the conflicting reports of what information wasrelayed between controllers, NTSB spokesman Mike Benson said thephone message from the regional center ``may not fully reflect whatwent on. There may be more to that conversation. It may need to bejudged in a fuller context.''   The FAA's duties include the nation's air traffic controllers.The NTSB investigates transporation accidents.   The FAA and the NTSB, as well as the controllers' association,stressed Monday that Avianca's message was not urgent and did notuse the word ``emergency,'' which would have brought the planequickly back to Kennedy and cleared the way for a second landingattempt.   FAA standards for flight emergencies spell out instructions topilots.   ``Common sense and good judgment will determine the extent ofassistance to be given in minimum fuel situations,'' the FAAinstructions say. ``If, at any time, the remaining usable fuelsupply suggests the need for traffic priority to ensure a safelanding, the pilot should declare an emergency and report fuelremaining in minutes.''   The words ``emergency'' or ``minimum fuel,'' according to R.Steve Bell, president of the Air Traffic Controllers Association,``would have triggered an emergency response by controllers.Stating that you are low on fuel does not imply an immediateproblem.''   In Washington, Secretary of Transportation Samuel K. Skinnersaid that while he could not predict the outcome of theinvestigation, he does not believe a lack of a sufficient number ofair traffic controllers was to blame.   ``You should not prejudge an investigation before all of thepeople are interviewed and all of the facts are in. But I believethat when the evidence is all in, staffing will not be a factor,''Skinner said, declining to answer further questions.</TEXT></DOC>
