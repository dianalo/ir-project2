Comstock, chairman and chiefexecutive officer. The company took into account &quot;thepervasive weakness in the commercial real-estate market&quot; inMaryland in deciding to reserve against the loans.</LP><TEXT>   In the year-earlier third quarter, Baltimore Bancorp hadnet income of $5 million, or 39 cents a share, including anextraordinary gain of $1.1 million, or nine cents a share.   Baltimore Bancorp also said it reduced its quarterlydividend to nine cents from 15 cents a share. The dividend ispayable Oct. 1 to shares of record Sept. 16. Holders willreceive a total of 10 cents a share, including one cent fromthe previously announced redemption of &quot;poison pill&quot;stockholder rights.
