Harry Reid, chairman of the toxic substances,environmental oversight, research and development subcommittee ofthe Senate Energy and Public Works Committee.   Reid said he felt Boeing was ``minimizing'' the effects thematerials can have on workers by pleading ignorance and emphasizingthe disagreements in the medical community.   Joseph Peritore, Boeing's vice president for human resources,told the subcommittee his company had decided to discontinue use ofthe material even though it was ``determined that the materialpresented no significant health hazard.''   Peritore also said doctors were divided on the effects compositematerials can have on workers and that Boeing had ``not only met,but significantly exceeded'' regulatory standards governing use ofthe material.   Peritore said that Boeing, in ending its use of a resin thatcontains phenol and formaldehyde, was responding to workers'complaints.   ``The fact that we believed the material was safe becameirrelevant,'' said Peritore. ``In the highly-charged atmosphere thatexisted, we felt the only way to alleviate our employees' concernswas to remove the material from the shop altogether. And we did.''   Reid told reporters after the hearing, that he felt testimonyfrom an official of the Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Co. showedthat firm ``recognized the problem'' and was trying to do somethingabout it.   ``The difference between Lockheed and Boeing was like night andday,'' said Reid.   The subcommittee hearing stemmed from complaints by Boeingworkers in the Seattle area and employees at a production site forthe new stealth fighter operated by Lockheed Aeronautical SystemsCo. in Burbank, Calif.   The materials are mixtures of plastic, carbon and syntheticfibers which increasingly are being used to replace metal in aircaft.   Nearly 100 workers are suing Lockheed, claiming workplacechemicals resulted in ailments ranging from dizziness, nausea andbloody urine to skin and organ injuries and cancer. Lawyersrepresenting the workers say at least five have died of cancer sincethe lawsuit was filed in 1986.   Boeing workers at plants in the Puget Sound region, includingKent, Everett, Renton and Auburn, have had similar health complaints.   Dr. Gordon Baker, a Burien, Wash., allergist whose patientsinclude more than 130 Boeing employees, said composite materials arecausing ``widespread, serious'' health problems for aerospaceworkers.   ``Chemicals are being used without adequate health and safetydata, without proper testing, and without giving some workers thenecessary protective equipment, ventiliation and training that areessential to safely using these toxic industrial materials,'' saidBaker.   Baker said his patients showed a ``definite pattern of symptoms''that were ``unprecedented and unexpected'' in a general allergypractice.   ``There are widespread, serious health problems throughout theindustry now that they are using the new composite materials,'' saidBaker.   Baker said that of the Boeing employees he has seen, 75 percentsuffer from extreme fatigue, 68 percent had memory lapses, 67 hadchest pains or trouble breathing and 68 percent had vision problems.   In addition, Baker said there was evidence that some of theemployees may be suffering from ``organic brain poisoning,'' whichcan result in varying degrees of ``incapacity to perform and thinkup to previous abilities.   ``It is of the greatest urgency that adequate safety is insuredin the workplace wherever these materials are used,'' Baker said.``The unfortunate victims of these chemical poisons should beproperly cared for and not be subjected to harrassment, demotion,termination, or forced to continue working in unhealthy workenvironments until they can work no more.''   Two women who worked at Boeing's Auburn plant testified they werenever warned that the chemicals could be dangerous.   ``I had no idea what chemicals we had in the shop,'' said BeverlyMcCormick of North Bend, Wash.   Ms. McCormick said the exposure to chemicals left her with anumber of medical problems and an overall lack of energy. ``I can'tplay with my own granddaughter for more than a few minutes,'' shesaid.   Bonnie Faye Schrum, who lives in Renton, Wash., said workers werediscouraged from reporting their health problems and were warnedthey would be fired if they did.   ``I'm not the same person I was five years ago,'' said Ms.Schrum. ``I can't go to the grocery store without getting sick, Ican't sleep at night, you don't eat, you have no energy.   ``My memory is a mess, I don't know my kids, some days I don'teven know I am in my home,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
