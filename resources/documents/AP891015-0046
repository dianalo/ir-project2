The $16 billion cut, formally known as a sequestration, isautomatic under the 1985 Gramm-Rudman Act that was designed toforce the president and Congress to reduce the federal deficit.This year, Congress and the administration failed to find acompromise.   ``I think it may be that sequester is the best availablealternative. At least it is real,'' said Richard Darman, directorof the White House Office of Management and Budget.   The automatic budget cuts of Gramm-Rudman took effect in 1986and 1987 as well, but Congress acted quickly to restore the lostfunds, a process that Darman called ``phony.''   ``This time, if it goes into effect, I think it would be good ifpeople would live with it and say, `don't restore the cuts,'''Darman said on the ABC-TV program, ``This Week With DavidBrinkley.''   The chairman of the House Budget Committee, Rep. Leon Panetta,D-Calif., said he thought Congress and President Bush could agreeon a formula similar to a Senate package passed last Friday thatmet the Gramm-Rudman targets.   The failure to meet those targets, said Panetta, was linked tothe sharp drop in stock prices Friday.   ``I think there is a relationship because I think that for thelast eight to 10 years, we've been essentially on a debt binge inthis country,'' Panetta said on the NBC-TV program ``Meet thePress.''   The federal debt has reached $3.1 trillion, and corporate andpersonal debt also have soared, he said.   ``In Washington ... we've reached a point where we simply don'thave strong leadership to try to reduce the deficit and make toughchoices,'' he said.   An author of the Gramm-Rudman law, Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas,rebutted criticism by some members of Congress that the bill hadled the government to engage in deceptive accounting practices andhad exacerbated the deficit.   ``The bottom line is, under Gramm-Rudman, we've cut the deficitin half. We've cut the rate of growth in federal spending in half.And the federal government has gotten smaller relative to theprivate sector of the economy,'' he said.   ``Has the Congress cheated? And has the president, in the bestspirit of bipartisanship, worked with Congress to cheat? The answeris yes,'' said Gramm. ``But are we better off with Gramm-Rudmanthan we would be without it? I think the answer is, clearly, yes.''</TEXT></DOC>
