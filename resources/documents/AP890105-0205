Volker Ruehe, vice chairman of the Christian Democratic Party'sparliamentary delegation, rejected the accusations he said were madeby both U.S. news media and officials.   Ruehe was introduced on ZDF network's ``Today's Journal'' programby moderator Peter Voss, who said the harshest allegations werepublished in The New York Times, which he described as a``traditional defender of Jewish interests.''   Ruehe did not comment on or suggest any support for Voss'description of the newspaper.   The New York Times on Sunday reported from Washington that U.S.officials suspected the West German firm Imhausen-Chemie of Lahr, inthe Black Forest area, of having supplied materials or assistance toLibya in building what Washington believes to be a chemical weaponsplant.   Times columnist William Safire later likened Bonn's claims thatit found no immediate evidence of wrongdoing to the professedignorance of ``good Germans'' about Adolf Hitler's Final Solution _to kill all Jews.   A University of Wisconsin law professor, Gary Milhollin, alsowrote for the Times that ``it should come as no surprise that a WestGerman company has been accused of helping Libya'' with the plantand said the Bonn government has ``rarely done much to discover orstop dangerous exports.''   Ruehe said at the start of his five-minute exchange with Voss:``We must put all the facts on the table. We have nothing to hideand we are ready to clear up everything.   ``But what is especially bad is that our political will is beingdoubted.'' He said West Germans strongly favor a worldwide ban onchemical weapons and this position is well known to U.S. authorities.   ``We are an important allied partner,'' Ruehe said, adding thattrust among the NATO allies is a basic.   He said he planned a trip to Washington next week to meet membersof Congress to learn what information they have in the Libyan caseand clear up any questions.   Bonn on Thursday announced it had found no evidence thatImhausen-Chemie helped build or outfit the Libyan plant in question.</TEXT></DOC>
