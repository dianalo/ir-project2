Critics at the American Psychiatric Association meetinghere challenged the company's insistence upon packaging thedrug with an exclusive blood-monitoring system that isdesigned to detect a potentially fatal side effect. Includingthe system, the drug costs $8,944 a year.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;I feel like I'm being blackmailed by the company,&quot; saidWilliam Reid, medical director for the Texas department ofmental health and mental retardation. The price amounts &quot;to aransom for taxpayers,&quot; he said, while holding chronicschizophrenic patients &quot;hostage to their illness.&quot;   Dr. Reid's comments reflect fierce emotions that the drughas provoked among the mental-health profession since theU.S. subsidiary of Switzerland's Sandoz Ltd. introduced thedrug here in February. By bundling the drug with themonitoring system, critics say, Sandoz has priced it out ofreach of desperately ill people who need it most. Themonitoring system is administered by the Caremark subsidiaryof Baxter International Inc., Deerfield, Ill.   Arguing that the majority of eligible patients are poorand supported by government welfare programs -- some of whichwon't cover the treatment at the current price -- the criticsurged Sandoz to allow alternatives to the system.   Clozapine, as the drug is known generically, is effectivein treating schizophrenics for whom conventional medicineshave failed. In some cases, patients who were confined foryears in mental hospitals have resumed normal or near-normallives on the drug.   But up to 2% of patients develop a blood disorder thatresulted in 43 deaths in Europe, mostly in the 1970s. Sandozmaintains that its monitoring system, in which patientssubmit to a blood test each week in return for a week'ssupply of the drug, is the only way to prevent deaths.Without its system, Sandoz says, three patients a week coulddie from clozapine, and the drug would be pulled from themarket. &quot;The only way patients will {get} access to Clozarilis through {the Sandoz system},&quot; Gilbert Honigfeld, Sandoz'sdirector of scientific communications, said at the forum. &quot;Wewill not allow patients to die.&quot;   But several psychiatrists and mental-health officialscontended at the forum that the elaborate monitoring systemis an overreaction to the dangers of the drug and that itduplicates services already provided routinely by doctors andhospitals for other drugs. They added that less-restrictivemonitoring in European countries -- where the drug costs$1,000 to $1,500 a year -- hasn't led to widespreadfatalities.   Laurie Flynn, executive director of the National Alliancefor the Mentally Ill, an advocacy group of about 100,000patient families, urged Sandoz to reduce the price ofclozapine. But she also said her group has no confidence inthe ability of state mental hospitals to assure the safety ofpatients taking the drug.   One woman who said her son has schizophrenia underscoredthe dilemma for many prospective users of the drug. Diagnosedfive years ago, her son was losing muscle control of histongue on standard medications. He went to ColumbiaPresbyterian Hospital in New York, where the woman, a retiredteacher, agreed to pay for the initial weeks of clozapine,assuming Medicaid would soon cover it. But New York'sMedicaid program doesn't pay for it yet. &quot;When I found outabout the cost, I was flabbergasted,&quot; she said. &quot;I'm beingwiped out emotionally and financially.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
