But trading was light once again as investors awaited several government economic reports to be released today.    Long-term Treasury bond prices advanced about 1/4 of a point, or $2.50 for each $1,000 face amount. The latest 30-year government bonds were quoted late in the day at a yield of 9.04%, down from 9.07% Monday.    Mortgage-backed bond prices also advanced, while corporate bonds were little changed to slightly higher. However, municipal bonds ended flat to slightly lower.    Earlier this month, interest rates fell sharply after several government reports indicated slower economic growth that could help keep inflation under control. This view was bolstered by declines in prices of some commodities, such as gold, that are considered important symbols of inflation pressures.    Nevertheless, inflation fears persist. Many analysts fear that the August economic figures represent merely a temporary slowdown and that inflation will accelerate again later this year. Lawrence N. Leuzzi, a managing director at S.G. Warburg, said investors are &quot;just marking time,&quot; awaiting more evidence on the economy and inflation.    The most important of today's government reports probably will be the consumer price index for August. According to the average estimate of 12 economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report, the index rose 0.4% in August, the same as in July. But many traders fear the report will show a gain of 0.5% or 0.6%.    A gain of more than 0.5% probably would spark renewed speculation that the Federal Reserve will tighten credit further, raising short-term interest rates, analysts say. The Fed's policy committee met yesterday to review credit strategy for the next few weeks.    Arnold X. Moskowitz, a senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., agrees with the consensus view that the Fed committee left its policy unchanged for now. But he expects the Fed to tighten credit another notch within a month or so because he expects signs of faster economic growth to emerge from the Labor Department's September report on employment. That report is due Oct. 7.    Mr. Moskowitz expects today's consumer price report to show an increase of 0.5%. That, he says, will be &quot;a slight negative&quot; for the bond markets.    Personal income is expected to have risen 0.3% in August, according to the average of estimates of nine economists polled by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report. The consensus also expects an 0.3% rise in August personal consumption expenditures. Personal income rose 0.6% in July, while consumer spending rose 0.5%.    Corporate Issues   Corporate bond prices closed generally flat to up 1/8 point in light trading.    In the junk bond market, Forest Oil Corp. dropped plans to sell a debt issue that had interest payments tied to natural gas prices, and instead sold a straight issue. The $100 million of 10-year senior subordinated debentures were priced as a 13 5/8% issue at par.    Ken Peak, chief financial officer of Forest Oil, said the main reason the company opted to go with the straight debt issue was that it was able to double the amount of cash it could raise in an offering.    &quot;We saw a lot of interest in the company on our road show, but we could only get interest in about $50 million of the natural gas debt,&quot; Mr. Peak said. &quot;Since the capital markets were open to us, we took advantage of it.&quot;    Although there have been previous debt offerings in which interest payments are connected to certain commodity prices, this would have been the first that tied interest payments to natural gas prices.    Meanwhile, Federated Department Stores Inc. outlined more details of its recent purchase by a company controlled by Robert Campeau in a preliminary prospectus for a huge junk bond offering filed Monday with the Securities and Exchange Commission.    The company plans to sell next month $350 million of seven-year senior subordinated notes and $800 million of 12-year senior subordinated debentures through underwriters led by First Boston Corp.    The preliminary prospectus lists a number of financial assumptions, including a weighted average interest rate on the two proposed debt issues of 14%.    Proceeds from the debt sale will be used to pay down a bridge loan that three investment banking firms -- First Boston Corp., PaineWebber Inc. and Dillon Read andamp; Co. -- made in connection with the $6.7 billion purchase of Federated Department Stores by Campeau.    The notes and debentures will both contain so-called poison puts, a provision that will allow investors to return the securities to the company at par if there has been a change of control.    The preliminary prospectus also details the lucrative fees that the underwriters will be receiving for their part in the Federated transaction. The firms that made the bridge loan will receive fees totaling $70.3 million. In addition, they will have received $59.1 million in interest from the bridge loan. And they stand to make an additional $29.4 million in interest payments if the debt securities sale closes by Oct. 13.    On top of those fees, First Boston received $18.9 million for other services provided in the Federated acquisition.    Municipal Issues   Municipal bonds finished little changed to slightly lower, with the new-issue arena stealing the spotlight from the sleepy secondary market.    The New Jersey Turnpike Authority's 7.20% bonds due 2018 declined 1/8 of a point to 92 5/8 after hovering in a narrow range all day. The yield rose to 7.83% from 7.82%.    More than $620 million of new bonds were priced in the new-issue market. In one of the larger negotiated transactions, underwriters led by Lazard Freres andamp; Co. tentatively priced $200 million of insured health facilities revenue bonds from the California Health Facilities Financing Authority.    The issue was oversubscribed by afternoon, with orders coming from a spectrum of investors, including property and casualty insurers, bond funds and individual retail accounts, according to the lead underwriter.    Separately, the Securities and Exchange Commission plans to release a long-awaited staff report tomorrow on the massive bond default in 1983 by the Washington Public Power Supply System. The SEC also will consider proposing a rule to enhance disclosure in the municipal bond market.    The report isn't expected to recommend any enforcement actions in response to the WPPSS default, which was the biggest ever in municipal bond history.    Treasury Securities   Treasury bond prices finished the session near their highs for the day.    The government's benchmark 30-year bonds rose 9/32 of a point to 100 28/32. The government's latest 10-year notes advanced to 102 1/32 from 101 25/32, while the yield fell to 8.93% from 8.97%.    The yield on two-year Treasury notes dipped to 8.40% from 8.42%, while the yield on the government's notes due in about five years fell to 8.66% from 8.69%.    Shearson Lehman Hutton's index of long-term Treasury bonds rose 3.15 points to 1239.78, just below its high for the day of 1240.43. The low was 1236.13.    Rates rose slightly on short-term Treasury bills. The latest three-month bill rate rose to 7.19% bid from an average of 7.17% set at Monday's government auction. The latest six-month bill rate rose to 7.36% bid from 7.34%.    In a move that surprised some bond traders, the Federal Reserve moved yesterday to inject reserves into the banking system. The Fed executed two-day repurchase agreements for its own account at a time when the interest rate on federal funds, or reserves that banks lend each other, stood at 8%.    Several traders initially thought this might be a sign that the Fed is trying to push the federal funds rate down to 8% from the 8 1/8% to 8 1/4% range of recent days. But many analysts quickly disagreed. They said the Fed merely was acting to offset technical factors draining reserves and that the central bank hasn't changed its credit policy. They contend that the funds rate will continue hovering between about 8% and 8 1/4%.    &quot;I don't think they're in the process of easing,&quot; said James Fralick, an economist at Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. &quot;They're trying to stay ahead of the drain&quot; on reserves created by rising Treasury balances at the Fed, he said.    Foreign Bonds   In London, a strong rally swept through the U.K. government bond market after the government reported declines in the rate of growth of bank and building society lending in August.    Analysts interpreted the figures as a signal that U.K. base rates won't be raised imminently from the current 12% level. Nevertheless, some forecasters still expect higher inflation and interest rates later this year.    Prices of actively traded gilts soared more than a point. For example, the Treasury's 11 3/4% bonds due 2003/2007 jumped 1 2/32 points to 114 3/8 to yield 9.85%. The Treasury's 11 3/4% issue due 1991 advanced 15/32 of a point to 102 10/32 to yield 10.55%, while the 12% issue due 1995 was up 25/32 at 107 1/32 to yield 10.42%.    The market shrugged off a report that Sterling M-0, the narrow measure of the U.K. money supply, rose 1% during the month for a 7.8% annual rate. That was far above the central bank's target.    In Tokyo, Japanese government bond prices fell in light trading. The government's benchmark No. 105, 5% issue due 1997 fell to a price of 98.96, down 0.41 yen per 100 yen face value. The yield rose to 5.165, up 6.5 basis points on the day. The range was 5.105% to 5.185%.    In West Germany, government bond prices edged downward, erasing part of Monday's strong gains. The government's benchmark 6 3/4% issue due in 1998 declined 0.10 point to 100.90 to yield 6.62%. Prices had risen Monday on news that the government is allowing foreigners to purchase five-year bonds.    On the Eurobond side, prices were flat to down 1/8 of a point. The Kingdom of Belgium's 5 1/2% issue of 1993 declined 0.05 point to 98.85 to yield 5.765%. Electricite de France's 6 1/8% issue of 1998 declined 0.10 point at 98.80 to yield 6.287%.    Separately, Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said in Washington that &quot;it may be necessary&quot; for central banks to send a new signal to the markets that they intend to keep inflation under control. But he didn't provide details.    Canadian government bond prices inched higher in light trading. The government's benchmark 10-year issue rose 1/8 of a point to 100 3/4 bid, to yield 10.13%.    Separately, three new Eurodollar bond offerings were offered to investors yesterday, raising the total so far this week to more than $1 billion. Some dealers say the market is glutted and that this may begin to limit further Eurodollar bond offerings.    Among yesterday's new offerings was a $250 million issue by IBM Credit Corp., a unit of IBM Corp. Also, there was a $200 million issue by Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan and a $100 million issue by Lincoln National Corp., a U.S. insurance concern.    Mortgage-Backed Securities   Ginnie Maes and other mortgage issues ended a quiet session with gains of 2/32 to 6/32.    Among active pass-through securities, the October Ginnie Mae 9% issue was quoted at 94 3/4, up 6/32; the 10% issue at 100 3/8, up 1/8; and the 11% issue at 105 1/8, up 2/32. Freddie Mac's 10% issue was quoted at 99 7/8, up 1/8.    Ginnie Mae's 10% securities were yielding 10.08% to a 12-year average life assumption, as the spread above the 10-year Treasury widened one basis point to 114 basis points.    Trading in derivative mortgage securities and asset-backed issues was light. </TEXT></DOC>
