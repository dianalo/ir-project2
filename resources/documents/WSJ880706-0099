The GAO, in a strongly worded draft report, declared that the land exchanges involving the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge &quot;are not in the best interests&quot; of the U.S. government.    It found that the Interior Department priced native lands at six times their fair market value, would get little wildlife-protection benefit from most of the acreage it would obtain and should have used competitive bidding. It urged the department to drop the plan, and failing that called on Congress to reject the proposal.    Copies of the draft were released by Rep. George Miller (D., Calif.), a critic of the exchanges who is holding a hearing tomorrow featuring GAO testimony on the subject. Staffers for Rep. Miller said the GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, isn't expected to change the draft substantially.    The outspoken draft deals a setback to tentative accords -- jointly dubbed &quot;the megatrade&quot; by environmentalists -- that the department secretly negotiated last year with four Alaskan native regional corporations and companies representing 18 native villages. Each of the native groups has backing from one or more oil companies that seek to explore and develop the tracts.    Interior and some oil-company officials call the refuge land in northeastern Alaska the most promising onshore prospect for oil and gas in North America. But the refuge also plays host to a seasonal migration of a large caribou herd, so its preservation from development has been a high priority for several conservation organizations.    Interior Secretary Donald Hodel has said he won't complete the trade without receiving approval from Congress. Strongly negative congressional response to the exchange has shelved action on the plan. Also stalled is a bill, cleared by the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee, that would authorize the Interior Department to lease oil and gas rights on the arctic refuge.    The megatrade calls for the native groups to get oil rights to about 166,000 acres in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge's coastal plain in exchange for surface rights to almost 900,000 acres of their holdings in other Alaskan refuges.    According to the GAO, 76% of the lands going to the government would provide little or no wildlife-conservation benefits -- 31% are of low priority or unsuitable for acquisition, 39% are already protected and 6% would remain vulnerable to mining. The GAO draft also found that the trade would net the Interior Department less than 10% of the two million acres it identified as its top-priority selections to be acquired in Alaska.    In a letter to the GAO, Susan Recce, deputy assistant secretary of the interior, called its report &quot;premature and misleading.&quot; She said the agency was right to boost Alaskan land values because, unlike elsewhere, the government cannot take Alaskan natives' lands by condemnation. She urged Congress to await the agency's planned report on the proposed trade and make whatever changes it wants. </TEXT></DOC>
