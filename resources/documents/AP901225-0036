The state newspaper said 184 people were convicted ofdrug-related crimes in Shaanxi in the first 10 months of this year.It gave no details.   Shaanxi officials said the illegal trade and drug abuse haveincreased dramatically over the past three years. Authorities inother regions of China also have expressed alarm over the country'sincreasing drug problems.   Chinese courts in Shaanxi and other provinces have begun toimpose stiff sentences for drug crimes - in some cases even thedeath penalty.   The Legal Daily said authorities broke up three smugglingnetworks bringing drugs into Shaanxi from other provinces such asYunnan this year.   Yunnan, in southwestern China, borders the ``Golden Triangle,''an area including parts of Thailand, Laos and Burma that has beenone of the largest sources of opium for the world's heroin supply.   Yunnan also has been a gateway for smugglers carrying drugsthrough southwestern China to Hong Kong for shipment abroad.   The Legal Daily said authorities from Shaanxi and theneighboring province of Henan worked together to crush two regionaldrug-trafficking networks involving more than 20 people.   It said that in addition to the legal crackdown, the specialteam set up in Shaanxi will increase efforts to curb drug use.Addicts will receive treatment to help break their drug habits andeducation programs have been started to prevent others from usingillegal narcotics, the newspaper said.   China's drug problem was virtually eliminated after theCommunists came to power in 1949, but it has re-emerged in recentyears.</TEXT></DOC>
