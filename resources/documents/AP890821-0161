Contingents of leftist rebels have come down the slopes fourtimes in nine months to attack an army post in the center of theramshackle district of 30,000 people.   The attacks are part of a year-old guerrilla campaign to bringtheir war against the government into the capital. The Salvadoranmilitary says the guerrillas are making urban attacks becausethey've failed elsewhere.   But three of the four raids were staged in daylight, illustratingthe guerrillas' confidence in their ability to at least partlyneutralize the government's single greatest tactical advantage: airpower.   ``Each time the combat is more fierce,'' said Marta TeresaFigueroa, a vendor in the stall-lined market alley hard hit by thefighting. ``It will happen again, and next time it will be worse.''   She stood 10 feet from the spot where Santos Barrera, a60-year-old mason, was killed by a bullet in the head the afternoonof Aug. 1. That raid also left a soldier dead, another wounded andtwo civilians _ a market-stall owner and her daughter _ wounded.   Three of Barrera's grandchildren stood on the stoop of his humblecinder-block home and told how they huddled under beds while thefighting raged for two hours.   Asked if the attacks made her afraid to come to the market,16-year-old cheese-seller Julieta Lopez said, ``Yes. But necessityobliges us to risk our lives.''   Though residents of San Ramon have nothing against the soldiersmanning the post, several said there is a feeling that thedetachment should be withdrawn, or at least moved from thedistrict's center.   Miguel Angel Rivera's arm is still bandaged and in a sling from awound he received in November during the first attack on San Ramon.He had stopped to light a cigarette for a soldier when the firstfusillade exploded out of the darkness.   The bone in the 21-year-old bus fare-taker's upper arm wasshattered, the artery severed and much of the nerve destroyed.   ``They should remove the post to a more isolated place,'' hesaid, standing a block from the one-story house that serves as the15-man detachment's headquarters and barracks.   The house is distinguished from its neighbors by green-and-blackcamouflage daub and sandbag positions at its corners.   ``There are too many people around here _ the market, the school,the church, people who have nothing to do with the conflict _ andthings happen to them,'' Rivera said.   Sgt. Mario Ventura Lopez, a stocky 51-year-old formerparatrooper, commands the post. A 32-year army veteran, Ventura losta lung from a wound suffered in combat with the rebels in 1982.   Standing next to a patched hole in the wall where an antitankrocket struck in the previous attack, Ventura said his detachmentwas there ``to protect the community from these terroristdelinquents.''   He estimated that about 100 rebels took part in the attack Aug.1. His troops were reinforced soon after it began by scores of 1stBrigade soldiers on constant patrol around the San Salvadorvolcano's base.   A UH-1H helicopter with two M-60 machine-guns _ one of 70U.S.-supplied choppers in the Salvadoran air force _ circled about3,000 feet above San Ramon shortly after the battle began, too highfor its gunfire to be effective.   The helicopters aren't coming in as close as they used to becausethe guerrillas have acquired several hundred Soviet-designedDragunov sniper rifles, which have a range of 800 yards, comparedwith about 300 yards for an ordinary assault rifle. The helicoptershave been taking more hits and abandoning more missions.   With government air power reduced, the rebels have been able tolaunch more daytime attacks than at any time in the last four yearsof the conflict that began nearly a decade ago.   Ventura contended his post is getting ever-greater acceptance andsupport from the local people.   ``They're tiring of seeing the way the terrorists' actions affectthe civilian population,'' he said.   But a dozen residents interviewed indicated little or noanimosity toward the attackers. It was clear, however, they weresick of the war.   ``One asks oneself whey the two sides are fighting, and onedoesn't find an answer,'' said a produce vendor who preferred not togive her name.   Even Rivera says he has nothing against the rebel who wounded himso severely.   ``It was just bad luck,'' he said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Wed AMs, Aug. 30</NOTE></DOC>
