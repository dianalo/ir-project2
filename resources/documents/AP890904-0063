Interior Minister Istvan Horvath indicated it might even be weeksbefore the thousands of East Germans are allowed to leave Hungary inthe unique emigration opportunity.   About 5,000 East Germans are huddled in emergency camps inHungary awaiting safe passage to West Germany. Bonn and CommunistHungary agreed on a plan in which the East Germans would be allowedto emigrate to the West, and Red Cross officials overseeing thecamps said the exodus may take place this week.   But Horvath, interviewed in the Hamburg weekly Stern, was quotedas saying East and West Germany must reach agreement in the refugeecrisis, and that this could take ``perhaps a month, or one and ahalf.''   Stern did not say when the interview took place. A ForeignMinistry spokesman in Bonn said he knew of no change in Budapest'sposition.   A well-placed Hungarian official, speaking on condition ofanonymity, told The Associated Press his government is reluctant toauthorize the mass transport to West Germany until it can placateits angry allies in East Berlin.   ``There is need for further talks'' with East Germany, he said.   Red Cross official Wolfgang Wagner said Sunday the caravan wouldbegin leaving this week, fueling speculation that Hungary would riskEast German displeasure but was waiting for the maximum number ofrefugees to arrive at the camp so it could make the transfer aone-time occurrence.   Unseasonable cold and intermittent drizzle at the refugee campsincreased the pressure on the Hungarians to begin the transfer.   Outside one of the five emergency camps sheltering shiveringrefugees, West German diplomat Gunter Mulack told reporters thatBonn is just waiting for Budapest's word to launch the caravanwestwards through Austria to newly built tent cities in Bavaria.   If successful, the transfer would amount to the largest singletransfer of East Germans to the West since the Berlin Wall was builtin 1961, and would represent unprecedented cooperation between anEast bloc and NATO nation to resettle thousands of citizens ofanother Warsaw Pact country in the West.   More than 500 new arrivals registered today with Red Crossofficials managing the four overflowing camps in Budapest and afifth opened Friday in Zanka.   The lake is a popular destination with many of the 1 million EastGermans who holiday in Hungary each year. Up to 200,000 arecurrently thought to be in the country, and Hungarian Premier MiklosNemeth has said up to 20,000 of them may want to go to West Germany.   Some of the East Germans have been camping out for more than fourweeks, and a few are said to be suffering from colds and otherillnesses.   Vacationing East Germans began crowding the West German Embassyin July to demand safe passage to West Germany, forcing the closureof the mission last month.   Hungarian officials have maintained throughout that resolution ofthe standoff was a bilateral matter between the two Germanys.   But Communist Party president Rezso Nyers told a visiting WestGerman politician last week that Budapest would allow the EastGermans to go west, in effect breaking a 1969 bilateral agreementwith allied East Berlin to send back those who try to flee.   The decision has clearly embittered East Germany, whose hardlineCommunist leadership has been increasingly critical of Hungary'srecent reforms and moves toward a multi-party democracy.   With legal travel to the West difficult, but permission for tripsto Hungary relatively easy to obtain, thousands of East Germans havedecided to test Hungary's new commitment.</TEXT></DOC>
