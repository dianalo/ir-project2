The National Party, despite gains made by white leftist andrightist forces, expects to retain power in Wednesday'sparliamentary voting, but it probably will suffer its biggest lossessince coming to power 41 years ago.   Hundreds rallied at universities and barricaded streets withflaming tires around the country to protest the elections, andpolice arrested 500 people. Witnesses said police used tear gas,whips, rubber bullets and birdshot to break up demonstrations.   The protests were the latest in a mass campaign launched a monthago to defy apartheid laws that segregate the society and to protestthe elections that exclude the country's 28 million blacks.   ``The elections are addressing irrelevancies,'' said TitusMafolo, a leader of the defiance campaign. ``Once more the rulingbloc is going to elections, and ... the main concern is theprotection of white affluence and privilege.''   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwilersaid: ``We condemn South Africa's system of racial segregation andurge the South African government to permit peaceful expression ofpolitical dissent.''   More than 3 million of the country's 5 million whites haveregistered to vote, as well as 1.7 million mixed-race people and665,000 Indians. Some black leaders have called for boycotts of themixed-race and Indian voting because their respective houses have nopower to overrule the white chamber of Parliament.   For the first time since 1953, political analysts predict theNationalists could receive less than half the white vote.   The party currently has 123 seats in the 166-seat white House ofAssembly.   The extent of their loss _ and the relative gains made by theright-wing Conservatives and the anti-apartheid Democrats _ willaffect the government's pace of reform during the next five years.   ``It is widely acknowledged that the general election is the mostcrucial in the recent history of South Africa,'' government-runradio said Tuesday. ``The changes that await South Africans will befundamental and, perhaps decisive for the course of events in futuregenerations.''   National Party leader F.W. de Klerk, who became acting presidentin the midst of the campaign when the Cabinet forced President P.W.Botha to retire Aug. 14, has campaigned as a new leader with a newvision.   ``Our generation's greatest test has come,'' de Klerk said in hisfinal campaign speech Monday.   ``Our action lays the basis for a new South Africa, in which allcan achieve their rights, without domination or injustice,'' he said.   The Nationalists' campaign manifesto calls for negotiations withblack leaders on a new constitution and government, providinglimited black participation in national affairs within five years,but with protection against loss of white power.   The National Party concedes its policies could lose it up to 32parliamentary seats, chiefly to the Conservative Party. TheConservative Party currently has 22 seats and the Democrats have 20.One seat belongs to the defunct New Republic Party.   The Conservatives say negotiation with blacks will leadinevitably to black majority rule with whites being dominated. Theycall for complete separation of the races into different nationswithin South African territory.   The Democratic Party, expected to finished third, wants apartheidlaws scrapped immediately.   Although the Democrats do not expect to win, co-leader DenisWorrall said, ``A good performance by the Democratic Party willboost international confidence in the country ... and send a messageto our fellow black South Africans.''   Organizers said Tuesday's general strike, most effective amongblack students and union members in the port cities of Cape Town,Durban and East London, would expand Wednesday.   In Durban, on the Indian Ocean, some industries reported allblack workers stayed home Tuesday. The giant Putco bus company saidit experienced a total strike of black staff and passengers inDurban and other parts of Natal Province.   Commuter trains from the outlying townships into Cape Town andJohannesburg carried about 60 percent to 75 percent of their normalpassenger loads, transportation officials said. Police said therewas a 25 percent absentee rate in mostly rural Orange Free State.   The National Union of Mineworkers, the country's largest union,said 78,000 members at 16 mines refused to work Tuesday morning.   Police used whips and dogs to break up a demonstration by 700people at the University of Stellenbosch, alma mater of manygovernment leaders. Thirty students were arrested and several peoplebeaten, human rights lawyers said.   Youths set tires ablaze to block streets in townships outsideDurban and in Soweto. Police said they used rubber bullets, birdshotand tear gas against stonethrowers in Durban and Cape Town. Theysaid one black youth was injured by birdshot and arrested.   At the multiracial University of Natal in Pietermaritzburg,police arrested about 300 participants at an anti-electiondemonstration, including students, administrators and Franciscanmonks.   ``There is something terribly wrong with those who rule us ifthey cannot understand why such protest is occurring,'' said ColinWebb, the white vice principal of the university.   About 500 slogan-chanting activists in Lenasia, an Indiancommunity near Johannesburg, burned effigies of de Klerk and theleaders of Indian and mixed-race chambers of Parliament. Fireworksexploded from the effigies, which were doused with gasoline.</TEXT></DOC>
