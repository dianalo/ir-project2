During Mo(6)electroreduction on a mercury-dropping electrode in the presence of 8-hydroxyquinolineat the background of 2x10/sup -3/ M HCl in the range of potentials -1.1--1.15V the catalytic wave of hydrogen is observed. Catalytic current reachesthe maximum value in pH range 2.4-2.8 and it is in a linear dependenceon Mo(6) concentration in the concentration range 10/sup -7/-2x10/sup-8/ mol/l. Catalytic effect is caused by protonation of Mo(6) complexwith 8-hydroxyquinoline, adsorbed on the electrode. Adsorption of Mo(6)complex plays the most important role in the catalytic process, whichpromotes considerable excess of catalytic current as compared with diffusionalone.</TEXT></DOC>
