Buttoday he arrives in New York for a four-day visit that willtest that ability. It could make his subsequent six-day tripto the tense Middle East seem like rest and relaxation.   The irritants to U.S.-Japan relations that Mr. Kaifu facesgo beyond the usual trade squabbles. While Mr. Kaifu hasdeveloped a strong relationship with President Bush, withwhom he will meet tomorrow, the real challenge for him willbe to use speech, news conference and interview opportunitiesto assuage U.S. public opinion.</LP><TEXT>   Japan's delay in contributing to the Gulf crisis stillupsets some Americans, even though Japan has agreed to give$4 billion. Talk of Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. takingover entertainment conglomerate MCA Inc. is exacerbatingfears by some that Japan is buying up the U.S.   Justice Minister Seiroku Kajiyama's slur against U.S.blacks, the latest by Japanese politicians in recent years,raises anew the issues of Japan's alleged racism andarrogance. And if all that weren't enough, another tradesquabble -- this one over Japan's ban on imported rice -- isbuilding.   Mr. Kaifu will bring with him a new proposal onagricultural trade. But analysts say it will be minimal andisn't likely to satisfy U.S. demands.   He also will lay out for U.S. officials the outlines oflegislation that would allow Japan to dispatch personnel forstrictly non-military duties in such emergencies as the Gulfcrisis, within the framework of United Nations peacekeepingresolutions. But the &quot;general view&quot; is that &quot;it will be amatter of months&quot; before the outlined legislation isimplemented, according to Foreign Ministry spokesman TaizoWatanabe.   Under the proposed legislation, members of Japan's SelfDefense Forces who are sent overseas would be under civiliancontrol, would serve only in non-combat roles such ascommunications, transportation and medical support, and wouldhave to adhere to Japan's war-renouncing Constitution.   Mr. Kaifu needs a diplomatic triumph. He gets high ratingsfrom the Japanese public, but his many enemies among fellowLiberal Democratic Party politicians have picked up theirsniping, especially at his seemingly passive management ofJapan's response to the Gulf crisis.   Mr. Kaifu's close ties with Mr. Bush, one of the sourcesof his popularity, have to some extent turned into aliability. There are titillating references in popularmagazines to Mr. Kaifu's &quot;Bush phone,&quot; a play on the Japaneseword for a push-button phone that implies he makes no movewithout consulting the president.   &quot;He's probably saying, `Yes sir, yes sir, yes George,' &quot;speculates one bureaucrat. &quot;This is a leader-less country,but now it looks especially leader-less.&quot;   Foreign Ministry officials accompanying Mr. Kaifu to theU.S. are sensitive to these charges and worry that Americansmay be getting the impression that Japan only acts underpressure. This impression may have been fed, they fear, whena $3 billion addition to Japan's initial contribution to theGulf was announced the day after the U.S. House ofRepresentatives demanded Japanese action.   &quot;The prime minister has the important task to make theAmerican people understand that this is really Japan's owndecision, that Japan is doing it for herself,&quot; a ForeignMinistry official says. He argues that Japan can act withoutU.S. pressure, but has so little experience responding tosecurity problems that it took time to debate questionsarising from Japan's Constitution, which renounces the use offorce in international relations, except for Self-defense.   &quot;We responded to the crisis with unusually fast speed {forJapan}, but the level of expectation of the internationalcommunity for Japan with its size was way beyond our actualcapability, so frustration began to stir up {overseas},&quot; theofficial says.   The U.S. has been hoping that Japan would help lead thisyear's round of multilateral trade talks to a successfulconclusion by agreeing to ease its ban on rice imports.Agricultural issues are a key element in the negotiations,which enter their final stage next month. And a Japaneseconcession on the politically sensitive rice issue wouldincrease pressure on the European Community to lower itscontroversial farm subsidies.   But it doesn't look like Mr. Kaifu will be able to pleaseMr. Bush on this score. While some prominent Japanesebureaucrats and politicians have recently argued forliberalizing the rice market, government officials outlined aproposal that calls for only a 30% decrease, over 10 years,in overall agricultural subsidies from their high 1986levels. The proposal, which is much closer to the EC positionthan that of U.S., doesn't address the ban on rice imports.   Mr. Kaifu leaves New York Monday evening for six days inCairo, Amman, Ankara, Jidda and Muscat. The goodwill trip,scheduled before Iraq's attack on Kuwait, had been plannedfor late August, but was postponed because Japan hadn't comeup with its Gulf contribution. Mr. Kaifu is expected toemphasize Japan's solidarity with the anti-Iraq forces and toexplain the nature of Japan's contributions to the area.</TEXT></DOC>
