Polish officials, who are also contending with the loss of about1 million tons of Iraqi oil because of the U.N. embargo, have beenlooking for new supply sources.   ``Instead of the 13 million tons of oil which Poland has beengetting annually ... the supplies proposed for 1991 will amount tozero,'' said government Minister Jerzy Osiatynski, head of theCentral Planning Office of the Solidarity-led government. He wasquoted in a statement carried late Thursday by the PAP news agency.   He said Polish negotiators heard the news during talks held Aug.28-31 by delegations of the two countries.   ``The Soviet side suggested that in order to get any oilsupplies, Poland should establish direct contact and cooperationwith the republics and distributors interested in this,'' saidOsiatynski in the statement.   He said Polish officials followed the advice immediately butgave no indication whether Poland had succeeded in finding sellers.   Poland has traditionally relied on the Soviet Union for low-costoil for almost all its needs. In 1991, for the first time, Sovietand Polish trade was to have been conducted on a hard-currencybasis with Poland paying market prices for oil.   Foreign Minister Krzysztof Skubiszewski, asked about thereported cutoff at a news conference Friday, said negotiationscontinue ``but we cannot be too optimistic'' about substantialsupplies.   In addition to oil cutbacks, the Soviet negotiators also saidthat supplies of natural gas sold to Poland will be reduced fromthis year's level of more than 8.2 billion cubic meters to 5.2billion cubic meters.   Deliveries of Soviet oil to Poland so far this year have beenrunning up to 50 percent behind schedule, the government has said.   Gasoline prices were increased by an average of 30 percent onSept. 1 to curb demand and cover the added cost of supplies.</TEXT></DOC>
