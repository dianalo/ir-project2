This article, is a summaryof structural features that govern the translation of viral mRNAs: wherethe synthesis of a protein starts and ends, how many proteins can beproduced from one mRNA, and how efficiently. The next section focuseson the interplay between viral and cellular mRNAs and the translationalmachinery. That interplay, together with the intrinsic structure of viralmRNAs, determines the patterns of translation in infected cells. Thefinal section points out some possibilities for translational regulationthat can only be glimpsed at present, but are likely to come into focusin the future.</TEXT></DOC>
