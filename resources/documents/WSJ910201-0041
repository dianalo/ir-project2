The new chip, coupled with rumors that Compaq ComputerCorp. plans to use Mips' chips, sparked a 23% rise in thecompany's stock yesterday.</LP><TEXT>   Mips' new chip, the R4000, is the first publicly announcedmicroprocessor to process 64 bits of information at a time,twice as much as today's leading-edge microprocessors.Although the company's development of the new chip hasn'tbeen a secret, few experts expected a 64-bit architecture,which allows the chip to process information much faster thantoday's chips. &quot;It was a big surprise,&quot; said Michael Slater,editor of the newsletter Microprocessor Report.   Mips President Robert Miller said the Sunnyvale, Calif.,company had nearly finished designing the R4000 and wouldstart shipping samples this spring. The chip squeezes incircuits that in older Mips' computers required 32 differentchips, he said.   Meanwhile, rumors that Compaq had chosen the chip helpeddrive Mips's stock up to a close of $13.375, up $2.50, innational over-the-counter trading yesterday. Compaq was knownto be looking at chips designed by Mips and Sun MicrosystemsInc. for a new generation of workstations. But, said analystMark Stahlman of Alex. Brown andamp; Sons Inc., &quot;the rumors havebecome too consistent and broad-based to be ignored anymore.&quot;   Mips' Mr. Miller and a Compaq spokesman said they couldn'tcomment on the speculation.   Winning over Compaq would be a coup for Mips, which hasbeen battling rivals to convince the world's computer makersto use its chips. Along with companies such as Sun andMotorola Inc., Mips is attempting to win converts tomicroprocessor chips that employ a new high-speed technologycalled reduced instruction-set computing, or RISC.   A Compaq decision for Mips, says Mr. Stahlman, would giveevidence that &quot;RISC products are going to have a much largerrole to play than most market observers have been willing toadmit,&quot; and that competitors &quot;are likely to have to sharethose market opportunities.&quot;   Indeed, Mips is aiming at the desktop-computer market nowdominated by Intel Corp.'s chips and Microsoft Corp.'ssoftware. Mips' Mr. Miller said a broad range of high-endcomputer makers such as Silicon Graphics Corp. plan to usethe R4000 and that the new chip will be available in alow-cost versions that will allow computer makers to buildmachines that are as cheap as PCs based on Intel's flagship80486 chips by the end of the year.   Mips certainly could use a boost. Its earnings in thequarter ended Sept. 30 were only $143,000, down 92% from theyear-earlier period, and analysts said any impact on Mips'earnings of the new chip, or a Compaq order, isn't likely tocome until next year. And they caution that Intel still has astranglehold on the desktop that's not likely to be brokensoon.</TEXT></DOC>
