Overall, Sensible Grammar is highly customizable.andP;  Inparticular, the phrase-group editor is a powerful feature, and fine-tuning itto your specific style should be worth the time and effort.andP;  The programdoes, however, lack a spelling checker.andP;  Instead, the company markets aseparate spelling checker, Sensible Speller, for $99.95.andM;Once you have set up the program to your liking, running it isstraightforward.andP;  Documents in most popular word processing formats can beopened directly.andP;  Be warned, however, that it doesn't like Microsoft Worddocuments that have been saved with Fast Save.andP;  And at least once whenopening a MacWrite II version of the test document, the program informed us:&quot;A merge delimiter matches a Grammar marker character.andP;  Do you want tocontinue?&quot; We didn't.andM;Sensible Grammar lets you choose between checking the entire document orselected text.andP;  The program will automatically start checking your documentas soon as you've selected it.andP;  Suggested changes appear in a text box.andP;  Youcan edit these suggestions or type in your own replace-ment words andphrases.andP;  If the solution is not immediately obvious, you can log it or markit by using the appropriate buttons.andP;  You also can pull the entire sentenceinto the text window with a single click for more extensive rewriting.andM;The program can analyze the readability level of your document in terms ofgrade level, reading ease and human interest, and it gives you a word andsentence count.andM;Correct Grammar.andP;  Lifetree Software Inc.'s Correct Grammar is the easiestgrammar checker to use.andP;  Its rule set is not the most comprehensive, but itis more than sufficient for anything short of a doctoral dissertation, andthe program is compatible with a number of word processors ignored by theother programs we looked at, including Acta, Acta Advantage, QuickLetter andAppleLink files.andP;  It gives you the option to make a backup of your documentbefore checking it, which is useful and can't hurt.andM;Correct Grammar is an interactive program that you operate through a singlewindow.andP;  The program's text is in an unusually small typeface that,unfortunately, can't be changed.andP;  Open the document you want to check, andthe program begins its analysis automatically.andP;  An on-screen Quiet buttonlets you turn off individual rules.andM;The spelling checker is reasonably extensive, and the program offers you theoption of using Microsoft Word's user dictionary.andP;  This feature isparticularly helpful if you have already built up a user dictionaryreflecting your writing style and audience.andM;Grammatik Mac.andP;  Reference Software International's Grammatik Mac is acrossover from the world of those &quot;other&quot; computers, which any Mac user willbe able to guess from one look at the interface.andP;  But the most frustratingand potentially dangerous interface problem is in the implementation of theSave command.andP;  If you do not specifically invoke the Save command on yourown, Grammatik Mac will, without warning, save the corrected file over youroriginal document.andP;  This is rarely a positive feature.andP;  Play it safe and runthe program on a copy of your document.andM;Grammatik Mac has a very comprehensive and customizable rule base.andO;Customization is recommended, as the extensive set of rules tend to make theprogram's proofing and editing somewhat heavy-handed.andP;  The program allows youto check your text under one of six styles: general, business, technical,fiction, informal and custom.andP;  The program uses a different modification ofthe basic rules for each style category.andP;  This is an intelligent feature;writing styles, like styles of speech, necessarily vary with their targetaudience.andP;  Grammatik Mac also gives you the option of checking your documentinteractively, marking it with or without comments (&quot;advice&quot;), or reading itfor statistics only.andP;  We found that choosing anything but the interactivemode gave us an on-screen readability statistics box that could be closedonly by quitting the application.andP;  If you choose either of the marked-textoptions, Grammatik Mac saves the marked document over your original if you'renot careful.andP;  Questionable constructions are marked with a &quot;#,&quot; making themeasy to find electronically.andP;  You can edit the marked text and then ask theprogram to remove its embedded comments.andM;RightWriter 3.10.andP;  RightSoft Inc.'s RightWriter is the only program weevaluated that does not work in an interactive mode.andP;  Instead, it creates aseparate Markup document, which consists of the program's comments embeddedin a copy of your original manuscript.andP;  You can then edit that document inyour word processor and have RightWriter remove the embedded commentsafterwards.andP;  This sounds more complicated than it is in practice.andP;  Still, itmay take you a while to adjust to RightWriter's style, especially if you areused to the interactive mode of spelling checkers or other grammar checkers.andO;It is probably most conveniently used alongside your word processor underMultiFinder.andM;The only serious drawback to this method is that it is difficult to tell whatpart of your text is actually under scrutiny at any particular point.andP;  Thisis especially true if you are working from a printout of the Markup document.andO;Our preference would be to have the program work interactively while saving aMarkup document with questionable elements displayed in boldface or otherwisemore clearly indicated.andM;The program's spelling checker, like Correct Grammar's, gives you the optionof using Microsoft Word's user dictionaries.andP;  Modifying the existingdictionaries is intimidatingly listed in the manual as &quot;for advanced usersonly.&quot; Like Grammatik Mac, RightWriter lets you designate a document's style.andO;Categories include technical reports or articles, manuals, and proposals.andM;Offsetting the program's unusual work habits is its excellent set of grammarrules and its text analysis.andP;  In these respects, it is the most comprehensiveof the grammar checkers.andM;Performance.andP;  Besides testing all five packages on a range of normaldocuments, as a controlled performance test we used the following shortpassage that incorporates a number of common grammar, spelling and typingerrors:andM;&quot;There is a general consensus of opinion that English grammar consists of aset of rules known in its entirety only to oneself.andP;  This would seem to inferthat there are at least as many grammaticl systems as there are people whocare about such things in the the first place.andP;  In fact one might say&quot;grammar checkers be we&quot;.andP;  Perfect grammar is something we all aspire to.andP;  Atleast when we know that someone else is likely to read what we rite.andP;  Youmight say grammar is a kind of harmonious discord -- something like militaryintelligence.andP;  Or you might not.andP;  There is scarce any lmit to what some of usmight say given half a chance.andP;  Thank you.&quot;andM;Overall, the five programs were pretty consistent in their analyses of thetest paragraph.andP;  They all caught &quot;general consensus of opinion&quot; in twopasses: &quot;general consensus&quot; and &quot;consensus of opinion.&quot; &quot;Grammar checkers bewe&quot; was flagged with a general &quot;verb to be&quot; warning, but not uniquely; allforms of the verb &quot;to be&quot; were flagged in the text.andP;  The period outside thequotation marks in that sentence was consistently flagged, as was the periodwithout a space after it.andP;  However, Correct Grammar caught this error twice:The first time, the program read it as a sentence requiring a space after theperiod; on a second pass, it read the two sentences as one 32-word sentence.andO;The programs with spelling checkers flagged all the misspelled words, andwhile their suggestion lists were not identical, the correct word was alwaysone of the choices.andM;The readability analyses were similar, too.andP;  The consensus was that thepassage was fairly easy to read and fell around the seventh- or eighth-gradereading level on the Flesch-Kincaid scale.andP;  Correct Grammar gave it an 8.8;Sensible Grammar, a 7; RightWriter, a 6.79.andP;  Grammatik Mac, covering all thebases, placed it in the sixth-to-10th-grade range.andP;  MacProof offers word andsentence counts but no readability analysis.andM;None of the programs flagged &quot;harmonious discord&quot; or &quot;military intelligence.&quot;andO;Obviously, when it comes to oxymorons, you're on your own.andM;Conclusions.andP;  All the grammar checkers do an acceptable job of bringingerrors in grammar and punctuation to your attention.andP;  All but SensibleGrammar also include spelling checkers.andM;We liked Correct Grammar for its simplicity of operation, but we wish thatall the programs used a DA interface like MacProof's.andP;  Sensible Grammar hadthe most checking power, thanks to its editable phrase groups.andM;But even the best grammar checker is no substitute for a good workingknowledge of the rules of grammar.andP;  Perhaps the greatest benefits to begained by using one of these programs are simply a grammaticalconsciousness-raising and a newfound knowledge of your own stylistic quirks.andO;By using the programs and reading the manuals, you are likely to write moregrammatically to begin with.andM;We reviewed five grammar-checking programs: RightWriter, Sensible Grammar,Grammatik Mac, MacProof and Correct Grammar.andM;Some have more extensive rule sets than others, but all the programs weevaluated do an acceptable job of bringing errors in grammar and punctuationto your attention.andP;  Any of them will flag your most egregious errors andsuggest alternatives.andP;  All are capable of some form of overall text analysis,such as word and sentence counts, and all but MacProof evaluate readabilitylevels using the Flesch or Gunning Fog indexes.andM;MacProof is the only DA in the group and has the most powerful spellingchecker.andP;  It is also the most expensive of the five programs.andP;  With theexception of Sensible Grammar, all the programs include spelling checkers,all of which are more than adequate.andP;  Two of the programs, Correct Grammarand RightWriter, give you the option of accessing Microsoft Word'sdictionaries to check spelling.andM;All the applications operate by opening your document from within thechecking program, and all but RightWriter work interactively.andP;  Because ofthis, RightWriter can be less straightforward to work with, at leastinitially.andP;  Grammatik Mac, a crossover from the IBM PC world, has theleast-Macintoshlike interface and a dangerous automatic Save function.andP;  Ofthe stand-alone applications, we found Correct Grammar easiest to use.andP;  Also,it is compatible with more file formats (including AppleLink files) than theothers.andP;  Sensible Grammar's editable phrase groups are a comprehensive andpowerful feature but could take more time to modify than you want to spend.andM;Choosing one of these products for your own use is similar to choosing a wordprocessor.andP;  It's largely a matter of personal preference and writing habits.andO;Your chief practical consideration will be making sure that the grammarchecker you use is compatible with your word processor and that it can checkand mark your text without affecting formatting.andM;Checking grammar and usage is a far more complicated task than checkingspelling, depending as it so often does on contextual matters, such asmetaphor, that are opaque to the mundane, linear perceptions of a computer.andO;Unfortunately, English grammar is not a straightforward discipline.andP;  As werecall from grammar- and high-school days, there are more exceptions thanrules.andP;  Most of us have developed an idiosyncratic set of grammar,punctuation and mnemonic rules -- some of which we are prepared to defend tothe death, as readers of William Safire can appreciate.andM;The lesson to be learned from spelling checkers -- that none of them entirelyeliminates the need for a human proofreader -- is even more evident in thecase of grammar packages.andP;  With spelling checkers, you are usually safe inassuming that the suggested replacement word is spelled correctly.andP;  You don'thave to check a dictionary to be confident that you're correcting a problemrather than exacerbating it.andM;Grammar checkers, on the other hand, require a human referee at almost everypoint.andP;  The computer does not read context; it does not, as far as we couldtell, even read a whole sentence.andP;  The redundant phrase &quot;general consensus ofopinion&quot; was universally picked up as two separate errors.andP;  This being thecase, the applications can merely flag suspect instances and suggest how tofix them; only you can decide which way to move.andP;  The underlying principle ofthese programs is: &quot;Here's a situation in which a lot of people makemistakes.andP;  You'd better check carefully to see if you're one of them.&quot; Thisis about as far as present computer and artificial-intelligence technologycan take us.andM;Using a grammar-checking program efficiently and usefully is therefore asmuch a function of what you put into it as it is of the program itself.andP;  Usethe customizable menus.andP;  If you know you have a tendency to make particularmistakes, be sure that feature is present and operating; but if you couldn'tcare less about the passive voice, for example, turn that rule off.andP;  (BothCorrect Grammar and Grammatik Mac get a little hysterical over the passivevoice, tending to flag almost every verb tense other than present.) Most ofus have a few phrases that we overuse; if the program you're using lets youadd such phrases, do so.andM;Two of the programs, Grammatik Mac and Correct Grammar, come withsupplementary hard-copy &quot;rule books&quot; (Secrets of Successful Writing and TheVest-Pocket Writer's Guide).andP;  If this belt-and-suspenders approach appeals toyou, other books you might find useful are Strunk andamp; White's The Elements ofStyle, Fowler's Modern English Usage or The Chicago Manual of Style.andP;  -- ByLouise KohlandM;The five grammar checkers reviewed here essentially try to duplicate as muchas possible the functions of a human copy editor.andP;  We gave the five packagesto MacWEEK's copy desk and asked them to evaluate them for use in their jobsediting MacWEEK stories.andP;  Here are their findings:andM;A MacWEEK article checked with Grammatik Mac was deemed harder to read than aHemingway short story, the Gettysburg Address and a life insurance policy.andO;While we were amused by these findings, we weren't especially surprised.andO;Because MacWEEK is a technical magazine, its articles often contain long,unusual words that will reduce any statistical ease-of-reading scores.andM;We were surprised, however, that some of the grammar checkers can go beyondpointing out misspelled words and double punctuation.andP;  Editing is a subtlejob; improving a sentence may mean cutting out only one or two needlesswords.andP;  Grammatik Mac demonstrated this light touch when it suggestedsimplifying &quot;no later than&quot; to &quot;by.&quot; The program also suggested changing&quot;able to&quot; to &quot;can.&quot; It is changes such as these that make an editor's heartglad.andP;  And such changes are easy to miss, making the software a usefulediting tool.andM;Most of the checkers also point out cliches, which are also easy to misssince they are so well-worn we often don't even notice them.andP;  Some of theprograms look for potentially offensive language, including gender-specificwords and obscenities.andP;  Many of the programs flag passive voice.andM;While we found all these features im-pressive, we would use a grammar checkeronly as a backup to our regular edits.andP;  Given the number of oddballconstructions that crop up in real-world copy, the programs cannot be reliedupon to catch every mistake.andP;  None of the grammar checkers could substitutefor a human editor.andM;In fact, to use them effectively, you need to already have a goodunderstanding of grammar.andP;  The programs merely suggest politely that you maywant to change a phrase and then rely on your judgment to make the rightcall.andM;While the programs can be customized (an essential feature, otherwise thecapitalization checkers would flag &quot;Mac&quot; and &quot;PostScript,&quot; thereby driving usnuts), there are enough idiosyncrasies in computer jargon to make the grammarcheckers cumbersome.andP;  Doing a grammar check on every story would be moretime-consuming than we could afford at a weekly publication.andM;The programs were great brush-ups on grammar rules, however, and we had funseeing which grammar faux pas they could catch.andP;  But, in short, we don't fearfor our jobs.andP;  -- By Cate Corcoran, Anne Matera and Matthew RothenbergandM;LEXPERTISE USA INC.andM;MacProof: $195andM;175 East 400 South, Suite 100, Salt Lake City, Utah 84111; (800) 354-5656andM;Lifetree Software Inc.andM;Correct Grammar: $79andM;33 New Montgomery St., Suite 1260, San Francisco, Calif.andP;  94105; (415)541-7864andM;Reference Software InternationalandM;Grammatik Mac: $99andM;330 Townsend St., Suite 123, San Francisco, Calif.andP;  94107; (415) 541-0222andM;RightSoft Inc.andM;RightWriter: $95andM;4545 Samuel St., Sarasota, Fla.andP;  34233; (813) 923-0233andM;Sensible Software Inc.andM;Sensible Grammar: $99.95andM;335 E.
