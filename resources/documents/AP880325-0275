The survey published by Cushman andamp; Wakefield Inc., a businessreal estate firm based in New York, showed that 85 percent of thecompanies that relocated their headquarters during the past fiveyears moved to a similar type of location, while 62 percentrelocated in the same community.   Only 7 percent of the relocating companies changed states, thesurvey indicated.   The findings are based on interviews with top executives at 400organizations, including publicly and privately held corporations,partnerships, non-profit companies and government agencies. All theorganizations polled have 50 or more employees at theirheadquarters and have relocated in the past five years.   While the suburbs of large cities rank first as a preferredlocation for head offices with 36 percent, the survey alsosuggested a growing tendency for relocating in the biggest U.S.cities, Cushman andamp; Wakefield said. The survey showed that 28 percentof the relocating companies consider big cities the best type oflocation.   ``The survey disputes the widespread impression of a sudden waveof headquarters relocations and a mass exodus from the nation'slargest cities,'' said Arthur J. Mirante, president and chiefexecutive officer of the real estate company.   ``Only a handful of organizations relocate across state lines,''Mirante added.   He said such moves recently as Mobil Corp.'s from New York toFairfax, Va., and Firestone Tire andamp; Rubber Co.'s from Akron, Ohio,to Chicago are the exceptions rather than the rule.   The need for more space was the most compelling reason forrelocating, according to the survey.   Other reasons were a more favorable company image, loweroccupancy costs, a better quality of life for employees, betteraccess to markets, customers or clients, and a major change in thecompany's strategic direction. None of those factors, however, wereconsidered crucial by more than 24 percent, the survey showed.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Monday AMs March 28</NOTE></DOC>
