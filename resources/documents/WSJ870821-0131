However, when foreign ministers of the region met yesterday in El Salvador to fill the gaps of the plan, their agenda was as thick and untractable as the issues left unresolved by the presidents who signed the document two weeks earlier. Yet these lingering ambiguities are only part of the reason why Central Americans are growing increasingly skeptical of the plan.    Prior to the Guatemalan summit, most reports carried by the press led us to believe that nothing substantial would come out of the meeting because of the wide differences separating the attending heads of state. Ironically, President Reagan and Speaker Jim Wright's surprising peace initiative of Aug. 5 placed some Central American leaders in the position of having to support Mr. Arias's plan. A senior Costa Rican diplomat told journalists that &quot;President Reagan's peace proposal was the lubricant that made the agreement in Guatemala possible.&quot;    As recent polls have shown, Central Americans overwhelmingly mistrust the Sandinistas. The fact that the four regional democracies co-signed the document with Nicaragua does not necessarily mean the Central American people expect the Marxist regime to allow political freedom.    There is good reason for our skepticism. Just 24 hours after returning from the Guatemalan summit, Daniel Ortega went on Sandinista radio and television to give his own version of the commitments, explaining that nothing new was agreed because Nicaragua already enjoyed &quot;free elections, democracy and political pluralism.&quot; Mr. Ortega qualified freedom of the press as &quot;an option of ours,&quot; and conditioned the reopening of the Roman Catholic radio station to &quot;an arrangement&quot; with the church. As to lifting the state of emergency, he insisted on a prior end to &quot;United States aggression,&quot; an excuse used until now to restrict basic liberties.    A major disagreement with Costa Rica, which erupted in the wake of the Guatemalan summit, threatened to disrupt the fragile regional detente altogether. Instead of withdrawing from the World Court an accusation filed against the Costa Rican government a year ago for complicity with the U.S. in Contra activities (Daniel Ortega had promised on Aug. 7 to desist &quot;without any prior conditions&quot;), Nicaragua reiterated the charges last Monday. This prompted Mr. Arias to hurriedly telephone Managua for an explanation. &quot;A mistake of the lawyers,&quot; he was told by Sandinista officials. Finally, after intense exchanges between San Jose and Managua, and amid reports of strong opposition from Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto, the suit was suspended a few days later. Nevertheless, Nicaragua left on public record its defamatory claims about Costa Rica.    Mistrust of Nicaragua's intentions has been encouraged by other recent actions. Before departing to Havana Aug. 13 to confer on the peace plan with Fidel Castro, Mr. Ortega announced that forced conscription of youngsters and adults into the Sandinista Popular Army (EPS) would be continued and increased until &quot;the strategic defeat of the mercenaries,&quot; that is, the Contras. Moreover, any hopes that the Guatemala agreement would end restrictions imposed on opposition parties were violently shattered by Managua's police and Sandinista mobs last Saturday. About 2,000 members of the Democratic Coordinating Council -- an umbrella for political, labor and human-rights organizations -- who had assembled to inaugurate new officers, were beaten and their leaders arrested and jailed.    Signs that Managua signed the peace plan merely to end U.S. support of the Contras and remain in power indefinitely also include the applause given to the accord by the extreme left. In paid spaces of Central American newspapers, the Salvadoran guerrillas described the Guatemala agreement as &quot;a defeat of United States foreign policy and a victory for the Nicaraguan revolution.&quot; And Fidel Castro, joined by Daniel Ortega in Havana, warmly supported the &quot;regional agreement to cease all foreign military presence in Central America.&quot; President Arias called both the meeting and the statement of the two communist dictators &quot;positive,&quot; although he has not been so appreciative of criticisms and observations made to his plan.    Such developments have led Central Americans to look more closely at the fine print of the document signed in Guatemala. As Costa Rica's daily &quot;La Nacion&quot; pointed out, there are flaws and omissions in the agreement that could enable the Nicaraguan regime to preserve its Soviet-backed military and police apparatus while adhering to the letter of the plan. More generally, a Gallup survey published Wednesday found that nearly 80% of Costa Ricans have little or no confidence that Managua will comply with an accord that demands democratization.    Thus, the peace plan engineered by our president does not necessarily reflect the people's apprehensions. Sometimes leaders have to rise above public opinion to serve their nation. But in this case, the question is whether the public has really been served by this action.    U.S. liberals who praise the peace plan as an &quot;indigenous Central American solution&quot; must take a more careful look at the individual motivations of leaders in the area. Reacting to polls published this week that show a declining approval rate for his administration -- it fell from 64% in March to 55% in July -- Mr. Arias has stepped up publicity in favor of the peace plan. Actually, an extended visit to Europe during May, plus trips to Washington and other foreign cities in order to promote his diplomatic project, were viewed by many as a neglect of domestic priorities. In the aftermath of his European tour, a severe crisis among top housing officials -- building 80,000 homes was one of Mr. Arias's leading campaign promises -- lent credence to the critics.    In a speech last Sunday, President Arias asked Costa Rican youths to &quot;combat warmongers who object to this plan.&quot; Such rhetoric may score propaganda points, but will do little to convince the majority of Costa Ricans that the Sandinista regime can be trusted to do anything other than pay diplomatic lip service to this plan. And in the meantime, totalitarian business continues as usual in Managua.    ---   Mr. Daremblum, a columnist for La Nacion, is a professor of political science at the University of Costa Rica and CIAPA, a public policy institute affiliated with Tulane University. </TEXT></DOC>
