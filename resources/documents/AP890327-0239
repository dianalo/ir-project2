A filing for protection by MCorp, Texas' second-largest bankholding company, would supercede a request made last week by threeminor bondholders for an involuntary liquidation of the company.   The maneuvering comes amid a six-month effort by the FederalDeposit Insurance Corp. to rescue the 25 banks owned by MCorp,which has assets totaling about $20 billion and parent company debtof about $418 million.   MCorp sought federal recapitalization assistance last Octoberdue to deepening financial losses. MCorp's banks lost $903 millionin 1988, $213 million in the fourth quarter, according to the FDIC.   MCorp officials have met with noteholders several times sincelast fall, urging them not to take action against the companydespite its moratorium on paying debts while it tried torecapitalize.   ``MCorp deeply regrets that those noteholders ignored our pleasnot to take premature and unnecessary action,'' Gene H. Bishop,MCorp chairman and chief executive officer, said in a preparedstatement.   Mirroring comments by several industry analysts, Robert Rieke,of Rauscher Pierce and Refsnes, Inc. in Dallas, speculated that thebondholders decided to seek liquidation of MCorp because ofconcerns that the FDIC was moving too slowly in rescuing its banks.   ``I think a more expedited decision process would have resolvedthe problems and the bondholders' fears,'' Rieke said. ``There justhasn't been any apparent desire by the FDIC to resolve the issues,and that caused a buildup of uncertainty detrimental to allinvolved.''   FDIC spokesman Steve Katasnos in Washington said FDIC procedureshave been relatively swift.   ``You're talking about asking someone to buy a bankingorganization that has rather substantial losses and a masssiveportfolio to review,'' Katasnos said. ``You don't ask someone toengage in a multi-million transfer without giving them ampleopportunity to review documents and operations before they submitan informed bid.''   The FDIC has set an April 3 deadline for bids.   Neither the bankruptcy petition nor the company's reorganizationfiling should affect bank business, Bishop said.   The Chapter 7 petitioners were S.N. Phelps andamp; Co., a Greenwich,Conn., bond broker that claims to hold $2 million principal amountin MCorp debentures; and Janice M. Eberhardt and Carol R. James,each of whom claims to hold $5,000 in debentures, according to acopy of the filing provided by S.N. Phelps.   S.N. Phelps submitted a claim of $93,750 in interest and Ms.Eberhardt sought $234.38 in principal payment. James did not list aclaim amount in the petition.   I. Walton Bader, a New York-based attorney for the holders, toldthe Wall Street Journal his clients decided to seek Chapter 7liquidation for fear that MCorp would be forced to pump holdingcompany assets into the failing banks, putting the money out ofcreditors' reach.   The FDIC has authority to sell or otherwise dispose of insolventbanks closed by the Comptroller of the Currency, but a bankruptcyfiling would make any plan to sell the holding company subject tobankruptcy court approval.   The request for FDIC assistance appeared to hinge on $400million set aside by MCorp for the deal. Federal regulatorsreportedly wanted that money put into the local banks before theywould consider an assistance package.   MCorp's creditors indicated they would fight such a move,apparently fearing a repeat of last year's rescue of Dallas-basedFirst RepublicBank Corp. Regulators took over that company'ssubsidiary banks and left the holding company with almost no assetsto pay off its creditors.   MCorp has 20 days to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy courtreorganization after being served with the creditors' petitions forthe involuntary Chapter 7 liquidation, officials said.   MCorp had not received the petitions by late Monday, saidspokesman George A. McCane. The company learned Friday the petitionhad been filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court, southern district of NewYork.</TEXT></DOC>
