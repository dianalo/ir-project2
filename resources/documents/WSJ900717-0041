In an effort to preserve the breast, the researchers usedintense chemotherapy and radiation as the primary treatmentof 250 women in the various stages of breast cancer. Theanti-cancer drugs and radiation caused the breast tumor todisappear initially in all the patients, though 79 patientssubsequently suffered relapses of their cancer.</LP><TEXT>   The French report highlights a new development in cancerresearch, the attempt to replace surgery with chemotherapyand radiation in several kinds of cancer, said Vincent DeVita, former head of the National Cancer Institute and nowphysician-in-chief at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Centerin New York.   In the July issue of Cancer, a journal published by theAmerican Cancer Society, the French physicians said theirlatest analysis shows that all the women whose cancers werecaught in the earliest stage, when the tumors were stillsmall, are expected to be alive without any trace of cancerfive years after treatment.   For women diagnosed and treated in the more advancedstages of breast cancer, the expected five-year, disease-freesurvival rates range from 82% in women with moderate-sizedbreast tumors or cancers that had begun to spread to nearbylymph nodes to 52% for women with large tumors and spread ofthe cancer to distant lymph nodes.   U.S. cancer specialists cautioned that the Frenchresearchers didn't have a &quot;control&quot; group of patients who hadreceived the standard treatment of surgery followed bychemotherapy. Therefore, they noted, it's impossible to tellwhether the nonsurgical treatment is any better than standardbreast cancer therapy.   The new report, by cancer specialist Claude Jacquillat andhis colleagues at Salpetriere Hospital in Paris, shows thatit's possible to treat successfully at least some breastcancers without surgery, the U.S. scientists said.   &quot;It shows conclusively that it is a doable kind of thing&quot;to treat breast cancer without surgery, said Bernard Fisher,the University of Pittsburgh cancer specialist who has headedseveral federally funded studies of breast cancer therapies.The main unanswered question is whether the nonsurgicaltreatment is as effective in the long term as the standardsurgery followed by chemotherapy, he said.   An attempt to determine the new treatment's efficacy witha &quot;controlled&quot; study is now under way at severalcollaborating cancer centers in the U.S., Dr. Fisher said.Half of the women volunteering for the study will receivechemotherapy and radiation. They'll undergo surgery only ifthe tumor isn't eradicated. The other half will receive thestandard surgery first followed by chemotherapy. So far,about 600 women had been treated in the large-scaleexperiment, about half the number that researchers hope toenlist for the study.   Dr. De Vita added that &quot;we're trying to do the same thinghere {at Memorial Sloan-Kettering} with head-and-neckcancer.&quot; By replacing surgery with chemotherapy andradiation, doctors hope to preserve such patient's vocalcords, he explained. &quot;At this point, the results look aboutas good as radical surgery&quot; in head-and-neck cancer patients,he said.   &quot;The whole field is new and very exciting, although likemost new fields, it has its troublesome aspects,&quot; Dr. De Vitaadded. An ethical problem surrounds both the breast and neckcancer studies in that researchers are asking patients to trya new, unproven treatment when a treatment of proveneffectiveness is available. This is different from mostcancer research in which new, unproven treatments are usedonly in patients who are beyond the help of any therapy.   The French experiment extends recent efforts to get awayfrom a century-long practice in which the total removal ofthe breast and much of the muscle underneath was deemed theonly treatment capable of curing breast cancer. In the pastdecade, after years of controversy, less radical anddisfiguring surgery has been found to be as effective as theradical mastectomy in curing the disease. Today, many womenwhose breast tumors are only an inch in diameter or smallerare treated solely by removal of the tumor -- a lumpectomy --followed by radiation therapy, a procedure that preserves thebreast.   The French attempt to do away with surgery altogether isan outgrowth of research by Gabriel Hortobagyi, an oncologistat the University of Texas' M.D. Anderson Cancer Center inHouston, noted the Medical Tribune, a newspaper forphysicians that first reported the French results. In the1970s, Dr. Hortobagyi began using intense chemotherapy inpatients with very advanced breast cancer and found that inabout 15% of the patients, the tumors disappeared completely.Dr. Hortobagyi said that in the last three to four years, hehas been using chemotherapy to reduce tumor size in patientswith earlier stages of breast cancer, making them eligiblefor breast-preserving lumpectomy.   In their report, Dr. Jacquillat and his colleagues saidchemotherapy alone caused breast tumors to shrink by morethan half in three-quarters of the women. In 74 of the 250patients, the tumors disappeared completely afterchemotherapy alone. In all the remaining patients, the breasttumors were eradicated by radiation following chemotherapy.   The cosmetic results were &quot;excellent&quot; in 164 of thepatients, with treated and untreated breasts appearingidentical, the researchers reported. In 55 patients, thecosmetic results were &quot;good;&quot; the treated breast appearednormal, but slightly smaller, and there was evidence offibrous tissue developing from the radiation treatments. Theremaining 31 patients had &quot;fair&quot; results in which the treatedbreast showed obvious differences from the untreated breast.   The key question surrounding the study, as in most breastcancer research, is whether the chemotherapy and radiationwiped out not only the main tumor but any cancer cells thathad broken loose and had spread to other parts of the body,the so-called metastases.   As of the middle of last year, 72 patients had hadrelapses of their cancers, 11 of whom underwent mastectomiesand six of whom had lumpectomies, the French researcherssaid. The recurring cancers in the remaining 55 patientsweren't treatable with surgery. Forty-six of the women havedied because their cancers had spread to other parts of thebody, and six have died of causes other than breast cancer.</TEXT></DOC>
