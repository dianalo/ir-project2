The latest opinion poll, published Saturday, showed that the Liberal Party, which opposes the trade agreement, has moved into a tie with the Conservatives. Previously, the Conservatives were heavily favored to win the Nov. 21 election.    The Liberal upswing resulted mainly from a strong performance of the party leader, John Turner, in televised debates last week with Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and New Democratic Party leader Ed Broadbent.    In the debates, Mr. Turner and Mr. Broadbent attacked the U.S.-Canada trade agreement, claiming that it threatened Canada's independence. The agreement, which is to take effect Jan. 1, would eliminate over 10 years most trade barriers between the two countries, which already do more trade than any other pair of nations.    Mr. Mulroney told reporters Saturday that he remains confident that the Conservatives will win the election. He claimed the Liberal upswing was just a temporary response to the TV debates.    The Liberal campaign, which had become dispirited before the TV debates, has picked up steam, drawing larger and more enthusiastic crowds for Mr. Turner. The Liberal leader was greeted Saturday by hundreds of placard-waving supporters in a Montreal suburb. Before the debates, some polls showed the Liberals in third place in the campaign and some political analysts were predicting that the party might cease to be a force in Canada's federal politics.    Some financial analysts have warned that a Liberal victory would hurt investor confidence in Canada. The Canadian dollar, which closed in Toronto Friday at 83.04 U.S. cents, has been bolstered in recent weeks by what had appeared to be the firm prospect of a Conservative government's implementing the U.S.-Canada trade pact. Canada's major business associations and all provinces, except Ontario and Prince Edward Island, support the trade agreement. </TEXT></DOC>
