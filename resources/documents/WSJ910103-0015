These aren't the behemoth integrated oil companies such asExxon and Mobil. They are relatively small companies thatspecialize in exploration and drilling and that do little orno refining and marketing -- outfits such as Oryx Energy,Noble Affiliates, and Plains Petroleum. These stocks areexquisitely sensitive to changes in oil and gas prices.</LP><TEXT>   It takes guts to buy them because the bearish case is easyto make. Saudi Arabia and 10 other nations in theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries have shown thatthey can pump all the oil the world needs for the moment,without Iraq's or Kuwait's production. Many people figurethat when Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil again is added to the supply,the world will be awash in crude.   And that's just the supply side of the picture. Demanddoesn't look so hot either. With the U.S. economy in arecession, oil and gas consumption may be flat for a while.To boot, the winter so far looks like a warm one.   All of which helps explain why energy stocks in generalhaven't done much since Iraq invaded Kuwait, and why mostexploration-and-development stocks have declined. Forexample, Oryx is down 27%, Noble Affiliates down 14%, andPlains Petroleum down 18%.   Admirers of these stocks say the pessimists are beingoverly gloomy about the outlook for oil prices. Oil spiked ashigh as $40 a barrel in panicky post-invasion trading. Now,it's around $26 to $27 a barrel. Yet theexploration-and-production stocks are being priced as ifcrude oil were sure to fall back to last summer's level of$17 a barrel or even less, the bulls say.   There's something strange in the way the stock market isapproaching the oil-price question. Stocks of airlines,chemical companies and oil refiners all are in the doghouse,in fair part because of fear of higher oil prices. Yet energyproducers' stocks are also down, in large part for fear oflower oil prices. Sooner or later, the market will have tomake up its mind.   Oil-exploration stocks also have some short-termspeculative appeal, in case all peace efforts fail and a warbreaks out. Most money managers don't like to talk about this-- it sounds like profiteering. But they're aware that oilprices could shoot up to $40 or more if Iraq destroys somemajor Saudi oil fields or attacks Israel.   &quot;If there is a war, (energy) stocks are going to spikeagain,&quot; says Stefan Abrams, strategist for Kidder Peabody.&quot;I'd be happy to have domestic producers the next 60 days.&quot;   Longer term, Mr. Abrams says, &quot;The price of oil probablywill tumble sharply&quot; once the Mideast crisis is resolved. Buthe thinks many investors are being unrealistic, expecting theprice to tumble to $15 or so and stay there. Kidder'sanalysts think &quot;$20 is probably a good working number.&quot;   Bernard J. Picchi, analyst with Salomon Brothers, thinks$20 to $25 is realistic as a post-crisis price. That's just acouple of dollars below the current level. &quot;People are&quot;focusing on the darker side of all the scenarios&quot; that couldhappen with oil, says Mr. Picchi. &quot;My own feeling is that . .. a free fall in oil prices either won't occur or will beover so quickly it won't be an investable trend.&quot;   At prices north of $20, several money managers believe theexploration-and-production companies can earn good profits.   Greg Ireland, a portfolio manager at Capital Research andamp;Management, Los Angeles, calls Oryx one of the best-managedexploration companies, with a good balance between oil andgas. Primarily a U.S. driller, Oryx also has some North Seaproperties purchased from British Petroleum. This purchasehelped push Oryx's debt to well over half of total capital bymidyear 1990.   To fix the balance sheet, Oryx &quot;scrambled and sold somegood assets, along with some marginal assets,&quot; Mr. Irelandsays. &quot;They concentrated on what they thought was reallygoing to make it,&quot; keeping properties in the Gulf of Mexico,Texas and Oklahoma, while selling off some in California. Nowthat the dust has settled, Mr. Ireland thinks Oryx has awell-defined strategy and a &quot;pristine&quot; balance sheet.   Pioneering Management Corp. in Boston owns several naturalgas producers. It has more than 1.5 million shares of Apache,with smaller stakes in Noble Affiliates, Louisiana Land andamp;Exploration, and Plains Petroleum, according to governmentfilings. Mark Madden, who follows energy stocks for the firm,doesn't expect much action from these stocks in the next fewmonths.   &quot;We tend to be a little longer-term than other moneymanagers,&quot; Mr. Madden says. By three to five years from now,Mr. Madden says, the U.S. will have worked off the &quot;gasbubble&quot; or oversupply that has depressed natural-gas pricesfor the past three years. And he thinks gas will be helped by&quot;the impact of the Clean Air Act&quot; because it burns cleanerthan oil.   Using similar reasoning, Walter Kass of Curators CapitalManagement in New York likes a pair of natural gas stocks,Anadarko Petroleum and Devon Energy. &quot;I think you're going tosee a lot more uses for natural gas than you do presently,&quot;he says.   William W. Baker, who manages five mutual funds atOppenheimer Management Corp. in New York, owns shares inPlains Petroleum, which he calls &quot;an unusual vehicle&quot; becauseit has extremely long-lived gas deposits. &quot;Much of the value&quot;in the stock, he says, depends on assumptions about the valueof gas that will be pumped 10, 15 or even 20 years from now.   Mr. Baker likes to buy Plains stock when it's out of favorand hold it until investors are in a more-optimistic mood.&quot;From time to time, investors get excited about natural gas,and they look for pure plays,&quot; he says. At about 26, hethinks Plains is &quot;attractive now&quot; and makes &quot;a very goodtrading vehicle.&quot;   With all the uncertainty about energy prices, KemperFinancial Services in Chicago has decided to play it safe andstick with large oil companies such as Amoco, AtlanticRichfield and Exxon. Doug Terreson, oil analyst at Kemper, iscomforted by the big firms' financial strength and gooddividend yields. He notes that Amoco, although large, ismostly a domestic producer and emphasizes natural gas.   Similarly, Kenneth Hackel of Cash Flow Investors in FortLee, N.J., likes the &quot;very steady, very consistent&quot; growth ofcash flow at Royal Dutch/Shell and Mobil.   At the opposite extreme for risk tolerance is TomDriscoll, a Salomon analyst. He likes severalexploration-and-production companies, but his &quot;mostaggressive buy&quot; is Maxus Energy, which is starting upproduction at two big new fields in Indonesia. Aggressive iscertainly the word for this pick -- not to mention risky.Maxus posted losses in 1986 through 1989, is expected to posta loss for 1990, and had long-term debt on Sept. 30 of some$752 million, which is more than its estimated 1990 sales.Mr. Driscoll thinks the firm will gush with cash in 1991 andtake a big bite, perhaps $100 million, out of that debt.</TEXT></DOC>
