In order to coordinate with variations in the electricenergy/heat ratio of the system, a two-spindle 14Mw gas turbine whichexhibits a high efficiency even at partial loading has been employed.Use of public utility electric energy, power generation, or supply ofsteam can be selected and automatic-controlled. As the fuel, city gas,A heavy oil, etc. are available. The exhausted NOx amount is controlledbelow 130 ppm by steam spraying. A double pressure boiler has been employedfor supply of high pressure steam to the gas turbine for the NO reductionand for supply of low pressure steam to the factory. The cogenerationstarted in January, 1987. The year-average generation efficiency was30.4%, and the year average total efficiency was 73.7%. In order to preventthe gas turbine output from being reduced in summer, a water-coolingtype air cooler has been equipped, resulting in the output restorationby about 1000 kW. The automation and the CRT monitoring employed servefor labor-saving and enhancement of the reliability. No problems arefound on NOx exhaust, noise, and vibration. The energy conservation by25% was attained. The cogeneration has high economical effects. (13 figs,1 tab, 3 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
