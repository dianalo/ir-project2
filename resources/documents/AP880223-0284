The offer is contingent on the valid tender of a majority ofMoore McCormack's common stock, the inapplicability of Delaware'srecently enacted anti-takeover law, the redemption or invalidationof Moore McCormack's ``poison pill'' anti-takeover defense andSouthdown's ability to secure $635 million in financing, of which$500 million has been committed by a major commercial bank.   Tony Doumlele, director of corporate relations for MooreMcCormack, said the ``tender offer was totally unsolicited.''   On Monday, Houston-based Southdown and its subsidiary, SDW Inc.,filed a federal lawsuit which seeks to overturn Moore McCormack'santi-takeover defenses, including a poison pill provision thatwould make the acquisition prohibitively expensive.   The lawsuit claims that Moore McCormack Chairman Paul R.Tregurtha tried to illegally block the tender offer.   Southdown said in the suit that it will offer $31 a share forMoore McCormack, a building materials company. With 5.7 millionMoore McCormack shares outstanding, the transaction would be worthabout $177 million.   Southdown said in its suit that unless the anti-takeoverdefenses are removed, it will be deprived of the right to make abona fide offer and will be subjected to confusion, delay andlawsuits.   The suit said Tregurtha and Moore McCormack's board of directorsviolated their fiduciary responsibilities by setting up illegalobstacles that allegedly will prevent the company's shareholdersfrom considering the tender offer.   The suit also said that merger talks between the two companieswere initiated by Moore McCormack a year ago and that Tregurthainsisted that he hold the posts of chairman and chief executiveofficer in the combined business. As a result, Southdown said, itconcluded that its only alternative was to take a proposal directlyto the shareholders of Moore McCormack.   Southdown produces and sells cement and ready-mixed concrete andis in oil and gas exploration and development. It announced Mondaythat it has 137.6 billion cubic feet of proved natural gasreserves, up from 111.7 billion cubic feet last year. It attributedthe increase to successful exploration in Louisiana and Texas.   Moore McCormack produces building materials and is also involvedin oil and gas exploration and production, mainly in Texas andLouisiana.   No hearing has been set for the case, assigned to U.S. DistrictJudge Lynn N. Hughes.</TEXT></DOC>
