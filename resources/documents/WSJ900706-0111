The remaking of the political and economic map ofthe West is indeed a daunting task. But on the basis of whathas been reported out of the summit so far, the one thingwe'd say doesn't need much changing or fixing is NATO itself.As a political organization, it appears to be working quitewell.   It may not seem like much to say that a political groupingis running smoothly until you look around at the othersystems, many in the West, that seem to be forever wastingtheir energies on marginal political obsessions. NATO hasindeed kept the peace for 40 years, which suggests thatsomehow it has avoided fatal mistakes and found its way toimportant and sustainable policies, such as summoning thecourage and will to deploy the Pershing missiles at acritical point in the Cold War.</LP><TEXT>   So far, the participants at the current NATO summit arebehaving in a level-headed manner -- avoiding the morecredulous instincts of some analysts and even combining toresist the more utopian impulses of individual members.   Consider, for instance, that the big news out ofyesterday's session was President Bush's proposal to inviteMikhail Gorbachev to address the North Atlantic Council inBrussels. This idea seems in keeping with the apparently &quot;derigueur&quot; public-relations component of internationalrelations today. NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner ofWest Germany, a clear-eyed hawk on military matters, hadopened the session by calling on the alliance to extend ahand of friendship to the East. If Mr. Bush's invitationmeant that the NATO leadership actually wanted to clasp theSoviet Union to its collective security breast, that would because for worry. But, as Helmut Kohl discovered, NATO stillis able to separate matters of substance from symbolicgestures.   Mr. Kohl wanted a joint non-aggression declaration withthe Warsaw Pact countries that &quot;we no longer regard oneanother as adversaries.&quot; French President FrancoisMitterrand, with U.S. support, allowed as how this was not anidea whose time had come. In the quaint but clear diplomaticphrase of a Canadian official, Mr. Kohl's proposal was&quot;losing speed.&quot; Meanwhile, Mr. Bush's flamboyant notion thatNATO should alter its policy to say it would use nuclearweapons only as a &quot;last resort&quot; drew a mixed response atbest.   Or take the hot question of extending financial credits ordirect aid to the Soviets. Mr. Gorbachev went so faryesterday as to send the summit meeting a message, appealingfor Western aid, and the Germans and French are pressing theallies to do exactly that. But the U.S., Britain and Japanhave countered that any big aid package would be wasted now,a view that surely comports with the reality of Sovieteconomic disarray.   Two days ago, Secretary of State Jim Baker had told ameeting of Western aid donors that Soviet support forsatellites such as Cuba and its continued high rates ofmilitary spending were impediments to aid. Meanwhile DefenseSecretary Dick Cheney noted in Oslo Wednesday that Norwegianintelligence had picked up the Soviet transfer of 40 MiG-27fighter bombers from Hungary to the Soviet Northern Fleet onthe Arctic Kola Peninsula, suggesting a continued Sovietinterest in NATO's strategically important flanks to thenorth and south.   All of this suggests to us that notwithstanding theeuphoria over communism's fall, there are still people insidethe NATO alliance who are keeping an eye on the ball. TheCold War may be &quot;over,&quot; but Yogi Berra's central insight wasnever truer: It isn't over till it's over. Remember, 480,000Soviet troops remain on German soil.   The great unwinding of Soviet communism has just begun.But reports out of the Soviet Party Congress suggest just howtightly the Communist Party, no matter how bankrupt, iscoiled around that nation's life.   The world is changing. NATO is changing. However, it isfar too early for the NATO alliance, as some are suggesting,to radically alter its purpose or its membership. The deepseriousness of NATO's reason for being -- the continued peaceand security of the West -- has through its complexinterdependencies managed to keep bad ideas to a minimumwhile the alliance's core mission remained strong. In a timeof transition, it would be no small thing to have NATO'ssturdy presence intact.</TEXT></DOC>
