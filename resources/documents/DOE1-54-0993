Several murinestrains which develop SLE and sometimes RA-like diseases are now available.They should help in the understanding of the etiopathology of SLE andRA. Basically two main therapeutic strategies which use solely irradiationhave been tried;one being sublethal whole-body irradiation (WBI) andthe other fractionated total lymphoid irradiation (TLI). Other protocolswhich combine lethal WBI and stem cell transplantation have often beenattempted. It was regularly found that the bone marrow transplant (BMT)dictates the immune status of the recipient. This paper reviews the datapublished about NZB, NZB/W, BXSB and MRL mice in this context.</TEXT></DOC>
