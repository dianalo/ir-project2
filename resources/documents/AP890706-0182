(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Former Gov. Marvin Mandel was reinstated asa lawyer Thursday in a 90-second ceremony that he called ``the laststep in a long journey'' back from his 1977 conviction on politicalcorruption charges.   Mandel, 69, took the oath from Alexander Cummings, clerk of theCourt of Appeals, as his wife and his lawyers looked on.   ``We got it done,'' the former Democratic governor said as hesigned his name in a book containing signatures of other lawyersadmitted to the bar in Maryland.   Asked by reporters after the ceremony to describe his feelings,Mandel replied, ``It's really an overwhelming feeling. It's been along time coming. It's the culmination of many years of struggle.''   Mandel was disbarred after he failed to overturn his convictionon mail fraud and racketeering charges. He served nearly 19 monthsof a four-year prison sentence before President Reagan ordered hisrelease in December 1981 from a federal prison camp at Eglin AirForce Base in Florida.   He became eligible to apply for reinstatment to the bar when theU.S. Supreme Court overturned his conviction last month.   New lawyers normally take the oath at a session of the Court ofAppeals, which is on summer recess and will not return untilSeptember. Mandel got permission from Chief Judge Robert Murphy tohave Cummings administer the oath instead of the chief judge.   Asked why he moved so quickly to regain the right to practicelaw, Mandel replied, ``Because I've been waiting eight years.September is two months away. Why wait?''   He was unsure whether he will practice law on his own or join alaw firm.   ``Those are the kinds of questions I'm going to take a littletime to answer,'' he said.   Mandel, who was named governor in 1969 and was elected to twoterms, said he will remain active in politics but has ``no intentionat this point of running for political office because there are noneavailable right now.''   Having his conviction overturned and regaining the right topractice law were the two most important steps in returning to anormal life, Mandel said.   ``I think this is the culmination of all of it,'' he said. ``Ithink it's the last step on a long journey.''</TEXT></DOC>
