In this case, the LAMPF side-coupled-linac (SCL)quadrupole doublets are being upgraded so that improved harmonics andincreased integrated gradient strength can be achieved. Data are shownfor the old and new states that verify these improvements. The use ofinvestment casting technology to achieve these improvements is documented.</TEXT></DOC>
