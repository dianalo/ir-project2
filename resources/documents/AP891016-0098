Cliff Hutchison, attorney for State District Judge Jack Hampton,said Dallas Times-Herald reporter Lori Montgomery ``took advantageof the friendship she cultivated with Judge Hampton to write aslanted article about the judge.''   The statement came out in a fact-finding hearing Monday on thecharges made by the state Commission on Judicial Conduct. There wasno testimony at the hearing, but attorneys handed in depositionsand affidavits.   Hampton told Ms. Montgomery in an interview published Dec. 16that he gave a light sentence to convicted murderer RichardBednarski, 18, in part because Bednarski's two victims were``queers.'' He made similar statements to The Associated Press.   The judge said in the interview that victims John Lloyd Griffinand Tommy Lee Trimble were ``asking for trouble'' by soliciting sex.   ``These two guys that got killed wouldn't have been killed ifthey hadn't been cruising the streets, picking up teen-age boys,''Hampton said, two weeks after sentencing Bednarski to a 30-yearprison term.   ``I don't much care for queers cruising the streets for teen-ageboys,'' he said.   Hampton later apologized for a ``poor choice of words'' andinsisted that he believed the interview was off the record. He hasrefused to talk to reporters since.   Ms. Montgomery later received awards by the Dallas BarAssociation and a gay advocacy group for her work.   A May 31 letter from the judicial commission announced Hamptonwas charged with violating conduct canons barring judges fromcommenting on pending cases. Bednarski's attorney had filed amotion for a new trial at the time the statements were published.   Hampton also is accused of damaging public confidence in theintegrity and impartiality of the judiciary.   The 11-member commission could dismiss the allegations, censureHampton or urge his removal from office by a seven-judge panel.   After Hampson's remarks came to light, he predicted no one wouldremember them in 1990.   ``We are here to remind them that we have not forgotten,'' DanPerry, a member of the Gay Urban Truth Squad, said outside thecourts building Monday. ``We are here to remind Judge Hampton andthe commission we are not going to forget.''   Perry was one of about 35 protesters representing the Gay UrbanTruth Squad and Lesbian Visionaries.</TEXT></DOC>
