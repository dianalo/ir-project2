Gorbachev expressedoptimism in an interview published Sunday that he and PresidentReagan will sign a treaty to cut long-range nuclear weapons, and heproposed a joint U.S.-Soviet trip to Mars.   In a pre-summit interview with two American news organizations,Gorbachev said his policy of ``glasnost,'' or openness, includesfreedom of speech, but he condemned a leading dissident as a``parasite'' and accused him of ``sponging on the democraticprocess.''   The Soviet news agency Tass ran a partial transcript ofGorbachev's interview with the Washington Post and Newsweek, andRadio Moscow's English-language foreign service carried a reportabout it as its lead item Sunday.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The confrontational tone of President Reagan'spre-summit rhetoric apparently came as a surprise to Soviet leaderMikhail S. Gorbachev, even though the president has been usingsimilar anti-communist rhetoric for nearly four decades.   Reagan takes to Moscow the view that the relationship betweenthe United States and the Soviet Union, no matter how gentlemanlyit becomes, is a conflict between good and evil.   ``He is probably facing realities, what appear to him realitiesnow, but his likes and dislikes are probably the same as they wereall along,'' says Vladimir Petrov, professor emeritus ofinternational affairs at George Washington University.</TEXT><DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   On Madison Avenue, it would be called an imagemake-over.   In the Kremlin, the shifts and realignments in Soviet foreignpolicy over the past three years have been labeled ``new thinking.''   The change in appearance of Soviet diplomacy has boostedCommunist Party chief Mikhail S. Gorbachev's standing in the worldand improved the atmosphere at international meetings.   Stony-faced officials have been replaced by smiling, congenialdiplomats, such as Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze andCommunist Party foreign affairs secretary Anatoly F. Dobrynin.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   George Bush is waging a private battle on thecampaign trail with things that grind, whir, hum and clank. It's alove-hate relationship with heavy machinery.   The vice president appears to be perpetually climbing intocockpits of airplanes, easing himself behind the wheels of trucksand farm equipment, climbing into boats, pulling levers on assemblylines and donning helmets, hard hats and laboratory smocks.   Hardly a campaign day goes by without at least one carefullyorchestrated event in which Bush gets a chance to pose for camerasinside, around or on top of some form of heavy equipment.</TEXT><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   While most politicians crave seeing theirfaces on the television news or reading their names in newspapers,Michael Dukakis often acts indifferent to that aspect ofcampaigning.   As the Democratic presidential front-runner campaigned throughcritically important California, he repeatedly passed up easychances to add to George Bush's discomfort over theadministration's handling of Panamanian military leader ManuelAntonio Noriega.   ``I'm going to do everything I can to stay positive,'' he saidwhen asked on his campaign plane why he had avoided directcriticism of the man certain to be his Republican opponent in thefall.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A dark cloud of controversy hangs over Houseimpeachment proceedings against federal judge Alcee L. Hastings ofMiami, giving some members of the Judiciary Committee'sinvestigative panel an uncomfortable case of election-year jitters.   The panel is moving reluctantly and with great caution for tworeasons. One concerns the possibility of setting a historicprecedent. The other is the question whether in 1988, when a blackman is running for president, America is truly colorblind.   The House has impeached 11 federal judges for ``high crimes andmisdemeanors'' in its 200-year history. Only five of them weresubsequently convicted by the Senate and removed from office.</TEXT><DATELINE>HINSDALE, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Bob Duntley has traded in his ties andstarched shirts. Casual dress will do these days, when instead ofcalling customers from his comfortable office, he stands in line tomake his pitch on a pay phone.   ``It's like fighting with one arm tied behind your back,'' saidDuntley, 55, as he scanned a legal pad filled with names ofpotential buyers around the country for Ameristate Corp.'s $7,500steel-cutting equipment.   ``Actually, it's like throwing your money down the drain.''   ``It'' is the hassle created by the Great Phone Outage.   It began May 8, when a fire damaged virtually all the vitalhardware at an Illinois Bell Co. switching station.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Long-awaited new federal regulations tooverhaul Farmers Home Administration lending policies are expectedto cost taxpayers $8.7 billion and push as many as 65,000 farmersinto liquidation or foreclosure, according to the AgricultureDepartment agency.   The FmHA is often called the government's farm lender of lastresort because loans are made only to those who cannot qualify atbanks or other commercial sources. Overall, the agency's farm loanportfolio totals around $26 billion to 250,000 borrowers.   With loan delinquencies rising, FmHA was directed by Congress inlast year's Agricultural Credit Act to rewrite many of itsregulations so that borrowers would be given a greater opportunityto restructure or spread out payments and still hold onto theirland.</TEXT><DATELINE>FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   First, the incumbent questioned hischallenger's religious convictions and branded him a carpetbagger.Then the Democratic primary race in the 1st Congressional Districtreally got nasty.   In fact, Roll Call, a weekly Washington publication that callsitself ``the newspaper of Congress,'' said the contest ``is turninginto the nastiest primary in the country.''   Rep. Carroll Hubbard and Lacey T. Smith, who seeks to deny theincumbent the nomination for an eighth term in Tuesday's election,have traded charges of incompetence and unethical conduct.</TEXT><DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Twelve-year-old Adrienne Carter already has$160 socked away for college, and she's earning more each daythrough an innovative program that rewards public school studentswith dollars for good grades.   Adrienne plans to use the money she stockpiles through theScholarship-In-Escrow program to study architecture or interiordesign after she graduates from high school in five years.   ``I really, really want to become something in this world,''said Adrienne, a seventh-grader at the Cleveland School of Science.``In order to do that, you need a good education.''   Adrienne earned the $160 with three A's, one B and a C, a gradethat she's determined to improve. ``When I see A's it makes mehappy that I did that good,'' she said.   The scholarship program is the brainchild of Alfred D. Tutela,superintendent of the city school system, and is a joint project ofthe system and the Greater Cleveland Roundtable, a group of civicand business leaders.</TEXT><DATELINE>MORGAN CITY, La. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jack Kent is making money and enemies atboth ends of the 275-foot-long contraption he runs near this townof oil men and shrimp boats.   His hazardous waste kiln at Marine Shale Processors _ big as afootball field with a smokestack 140 feet high _ is a high-profilepresence on the flat southern Louisiana horizon.   It's also a target of two groups that want to shut it down: somelocal residents who suspect it's dangerous and business competitorswho accuse the company of skirting environmental regulations.   Marine Shale, which employs about 240 people, denies the claimsand insists that it cooperates fully with regulators.   In Washington as well as Louisiana, the debate centers onwhether Kent's contraption is an incinerator, which must meet oneset of regulations, or a recycling plant, required to meet others.</TEXT></DOC>
