On other markets, precious metals also advanced; energy futuressurged; grains and soybeans moved lower; livestock and meat weremixed; and stock-index futures retreated.   Copper for delivery in December shot up 5.75 cents to $1.2535 apound and analysts said prices could reach or exceed last year'sall-time high of $1.46 if the demand for tight supplies remainedstrong.   ``Copper continues to explode,'' said Craig Sloane, metalsanalyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. ``It's in anaccelerating phase right now; you've got everything working foryou.''   Major factors in the sharp rally included the possiblity of ageneral strike Monday in Peru, the world's 7th largest copperproducer, and of civil unrest in Chile, the No. 1 copper country,due to the election defeat of General Augusto Pinochet, analystssaid.   The Commodity Exchange reported warehouse stocks of copper at11,529 tons, down 846 tons from last week and sharply below theapproximately 80,000 tons in Comex warehouses a year earlier.   Traders and analysts expected the London Metal Exchange toreport a drop of about 8,000 metric tons in its warehouse stocks onMonday, Sloane said.   Although worldwide demand from copper consumers remains strong,the market has not seen the sort of panic buying that marked lastyear's dramatic rally, Sloane said. Copper prices more than doubledduring last year but rarely have fallen below 90 cents a pound thisyear.   ``I think the market is a little bit accustomed to it, so it'snot the same kind of situation we had last year,'' Sloane said.   Other copper contracts settled $4.35 to $4.50 higher.   Platinum futures rose sharply on the New York MercantileExchange but the other precious metals posted only moderate gainsin response to higher oil prices.   The platinum market faces fairly tight supplies and was boostedFriday by strong technical signals, Sloane said.   Platinum settled $9.80 to $11.30 higher with October at $527.20a troy ounce.   On the Comex, gold was $2.10 to $2.20 higher with December at$412.50 a troy ounce; silver was 6 cents to 6.2 cents higher withDecember at $6.435 a troy ounce.   Oil futures soared on the New York Mercantile Exchange on ideasthe Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries was nearingagreement on new production quotas to stabilize crude oil prices.   Rumors suggested the overall OPEC quota would be increased,analysts said. But if all OPEC members abided by their new quotas _something they have not been doing recently _ total productionwould be below the amount of OPEC crude oil currently beingproduced.   ``It's possible this could come to pass and, if it does, we willsee the market rally sharply, said Peter Beutel, energy analyst inNew York with Elders Futures Inc.   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 59 cents to 71 centshigher with November at $14.92 a barrel; heating oil was 1.46 centsto 1.72 cents higher with November at 43.21 cents a gallon;unleaded gasoline was .80 cent to 1.27 cents higher with Novemberat 45.42 cents a gallon.   Grain and soybean futures settled moderately lower on theChicago Board of Trade, reflecting disappointment over the failureof U.S. and Soviet negotiators to produce a new long-term grainagreement.   Negotiators ended two days of talks Friday in London with noagreement and no date for the next round of talks.   Wheat settled 2 cents to 7{ cents lower with December at $4.28}a bushel; corn was unchanged to 3{ cents lower with December at$2.93} a bushel; oats were 5{ cents lower to { cent higher withDecember at $2.52{ a bushel; soybeans were 9 cents lower to { centhigher with November at $8.04 a bushel.

Hogs advanced in line with higher cash prices while frozen porkbellies declined on profit-taking.   Live cattle were .25 cent to .47 cent lower with October at72.87 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .53 cent lower to .03 centhigher with October at 82 cents a pound; live hogs were .15 centlower to .65 cent higher with October at 40.42 cents a pound;frozen pork bellies were .27 cent to .45 cent lower with Februaryat 49 cents a pound.
