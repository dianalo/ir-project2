Five days into the voyage in May, Thai pirates in the South ChinaSea rammed the boat, drowning many of the 22 passengers. Theyattacked those who tried to hang onto the boat to save themselveswith long poles and knives.   The pirates abducted Miss Mai Ly, her sister, her aunt, and twoother women. They repeatedly raped the women during eight days ofterror and then tossed Miss Mai Ly into the sea. She swam for hoursbefore another boat rescued her. Her two relatives are still missingand presumed dead.   Miss Mai Ly is now staying in this austere camp near the volatileCambodian border where Thailand has sent Vietnam's ``boat people''to discourage more from coming. But she says she would never returnhome despite her ordeal at sea and the Thai government's refusal toallow the boat people to resettle in the West.   ``I would commit suicide first,'' she says as late monsoon rainsmuddy the floor of her bamboo and thatched roof hut.   The boat people continue fleeing Vietnam more than 13 years afterthe communists defeated U.S.-backed South Vietnam in April 1975. Butthey are now sailing into a world increasingly reluctant to receivethem.   More than 680,000 boat people have fled since 1975 and about615,000 have been resettled, most by the United States, Canada andAustralia. But in recent years, scaled-down resettlement programsand increasingly restrictive selection have left thousands of``long-stayers'' languishing in the camps for years, many withserious psychological problems.   In 1979, Asian nations already sheltering more than 200,000 boatpeople pushed tens of thousands from their shores, killing many, andthreatened to shoot others. But at a Geneva conference in July ofthat year, Western nations pledged to resettle the refugees andAsian nations promised to give them safe asylum.   That led to a recent surge in the exodus. The refugees fromVietnam now include not only those fleeing political persecution,but also ``economic migrants'' and people seeking to join relativesabroad.   In 1988, scores of Vietnamese drowned as authorities pushed theirsmall wooden boats off Thailand. Some were beaten in dreary HongKong camps, others were left to drift and die at sea.   ``The Western nations are tired of dealing with the problem andperceive themselves as no longer able to sustain the guarantees theymade in 1979,'' says one senior Western aid official.   In a recent series of urgent consultations, nations have agreedto another international conference early in 1989, but this time toforge a strategy to deter rather than ease the exodus.   There is some cause for optimism. Vietnam for the first time saysit will take back large groups of boat people. Previously Vietnambranded them as traitors and allowed only a few to return.   Vietnam reached a repatriation accord with Hong Kong in Octoberand seeks agreements with Malaysia and Thailand. In early November,a Vietnamese delegation visited a camp in Malaysia to persuade boatpeople they were welcome back home. But a major problem is thatHanoi wants only those who volunteer to return, while its neighborswant to send back anyone who is not a political refugee.   Of the 60,000 boat people in the region's camps, only about adozen have volunteered to return to Vietnam, says Sergio Vieira deMello, head of the Asia bureau of the United Nations HighCommissioner for Refugees.   In Hong Kong, however, 439 Vietnamese have volunteered to returnhome. Vietnam pledged they would face no recrimination and Britain,which rules Hong Kong, has promised financial aid to help themresettle.   ``We hope that a successful reintegration of those would break 13years of assumptions that once they leave Vietnam, theirresettlement in third countries is automatic, that the Eden is thereand they've got to give it a try,'' Vieira de Mello said in aninterview in Bangkok.   After subsiding for a few years, 28,116 boat people arrived inneighboring countries in 1987 _ the largest annual flow since 1982 _and camp populations swelled. In the first nine months of 1988,37,676 Vietnamese landed, double the number of the same period in1987.   That overtaxed the patience of Asia's developing nations,resulting in the most serious asylum crisis in years.   Thai marine police and fishermen pushed off or rammed boats thatarrived on the East Coast in a massive smuggling network involvingcorrupt Thai, Cambodian and Vietnamese officials. Western aidofficials said at least 100 boat people drowned and others wereattacked by pirates after being turned away. Hundreds of others werestranded on islands with no regular source of food or water.   Government officials called the boat people invading economic``opportunists'' who posed major security problems.   Thailand halted resettlement abroad and sent all new boat peopleto this camp in the nervous no-man's land of the Thai-Cambodianfrontier, alongside some 300,000 Cambodians huddled on the doorstepof the decade-old war in their country.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
