It is recognized that theEIS is not a precondition to operation of the reactors in the near future.Reasonable alternatives to long-term operation will also be considered.DOE will conduct public scoping meetings on the EIS.The continued operation of these reactors is based on Congressional initiativesand studies by DOE showing continued operation to be one of the key elementsrequired to assure maintenance of the nuclear weapons stockpile. Preparationof the EIS will be in accordance with NEPA, the Council on EnvironmentalQuality (CEQ) NEPA regulations (40 CFR Part 1500-1508), and the DOE NEPAguidelines (52 FR 47662).<ITAG tagnum="84">Invitation to Comment</ITAG>To ensure that the full range of issues related to this proposal are addressed,comments on the proposed scope and content of the EIS are invited fromall interested parties. Written comments or suggestions to assist DOE inidentifying significant environmental issues and the appropriate scopeof the EIS should be postmarked by May 8, 1989. Comments received afterthat date will be considered to the extent practicable. Agencies, organizations,and the general public are also invited to present oral comments or suggestionspertinent to preparation of the EIS at the public scoping meetings scheduledas indicated below. Written and oral comments will be given equal weightin the scoping process. Comments and suggestions received during the scopingperiod will be considered in preparing the draft EIS. Upon completion ofthe draft EIS, its availability will be announced in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, and public comments will again be solicited.Comments on the draft EIS will be considered in preparing the final EIS.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>Written comments or suggestions on the scope of theEIS, questions concerning the project, and requests for copies of the draftEIS should be directed to:<ITAG tagnum="15">Mr. S.R.

Comments received after that date will beconsidered to the extent practicable.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background Information</ITAG>To meet the national defense need for tritium as stated in the NuclearWeapons Stockpile Memorandum, DOE is proposing to ``assure the capabilityto meet current and projected needs for nuclear materials'' by continuingoperation of the K-, L-, and P-Reactors at SRP. The need for tritium isbecoming more acute due to the continued outage of the SRP Reactors andthe natural 5.5 percent per year tritium decay rate. In addition, reactoroperation to produce plutonium for national defense purposes may also berequired.Since these reactors were constructed before the enactment of NEPA, originalNEPA documentation prior to their operation was not prepared. DOE has prepareda final EIS on L-Reactor Operation (DOE/EIS-0108).<ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Action</ITAG>The proposed action is to continue to operate K-, L-, and P-Reactors atthe SRP to produce defense nuclear materials.<ITAG tagnum="84">Alternatives Proposed For Consideration</ITAG>The alternatives proposed for consideration in the EIS are:1. Continue to operate K-, L-, and P-Reactors at SRP well into the future.2.Terminate K-, L-, and P-Reactors operation consistent with other productionoptions (i.e., the so-called No Action alternative).3. Other production options to K-, L-, and P-Reactors operation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Identification of Environmental Issues</ITAG>The following is an initial list of issues applicable to the operationof the K-, L-, and P-Reactors which will be analyzed in the EIS. The EISwill address the environmental impacts of the proposed action includingroutine operation and potential accidents during operation of these facilities.In accordance with CEQ NEPA regulations (40 CFR 1500.4 and 1502.21), otherenvironmental documents, as appropriate, may be incorporated by reference,in whole or in part, into these impact analyses. This list is not all-inclusive,nor does it imply any predetermination of potential impacts. Additionsor deletions to this list may occur as the result of the scoping process.1. <T3>Safety and Health Effects</T3>_Radiological and nonradiological impactsof routine operation and potential accidents.2. <T3>Water Resources</T3>_Qualitative and quantitative effects on waterresources and other regional water users.3. <T3>Air Quality</T3>_Effects of radiological and nonradiological air emissions.4. <T3>Regulatory Compliance</T3>_Compliance with applicable Federal, state,and local statutes and regulations.5. <T3>Wildlife and Habitat</T3>_Disturbance or destruction of habitat includingfloodplains and wetlands and potential effects on threatened or endangeredspecies.6. <T3>Aquatic Species</T3>_Potential for entrapment or impingement of aquaticorganisms on surface water intake structures and impacts to aquatic habitat.7. <T3>Waste Management</T3>_Environmental effects of the generation, treatment,transport, storage, and disposal of radioactive, hazardous, and solid wastes.8. <T3>Socioeconomic</T3>_Socioeconomic impacts on affected communities ofconstruction and operation of labor forces and support services.9. <T3>Cultural Resources</T3>_Potential impacts on historical, archaeological,scientific, or culturally important sites.10. <T3>Transportation</T3>_Impacts of the transportation of production-relatedsupplies, materials, equipment, products, and wastes onsite and offsite.11. <T3>Decommissioning and Decontamination</T3>_Decommissioning and decontaminationof existing and new facilities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Related Documentation</ITAG>Background information developed regarding past operations of K-, L-, andP-Reactors is available in the public reading rooms listed below.
