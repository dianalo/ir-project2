While the court is widely expected to rule against Germany, at least in principle, food industry lawyers said it was possible the court might issue a vague, general decision that doesn't clearly resolve the issue.    The German brewing industry fears that an unfavorable decision could mean a huge increase in competition from other Common Market countries and could jeopardize some of the country's many small and medium-sized breweries. European Community legal authorities said a strong verdict in the case could set a precedent for eliminating barriers to trade in other food products.    The court is also expected to issue a decision today in a similar case involving Greece.    The court's 13 judges have taken nearly six months to decide the cases, an unusually long time. EC officials said this probably indicates that the judges have had difficulty agreeing on an opinion.    Germany has been able to tightly limit beer imports based on a law that severely restricts the ingredients that can be used in beer. The law, derived from a Bavarian law on beer purity that dates from 1516, requires that beer sold in Germany can be made only from malted cereals, hops, water and yeast. This effectively prohibits the use of additives, as well as other types of grains. The law has kept beer imports into Germany to a trickle.    Germany has contended the restrictions are necessary to protect the health of German beer drinkers. Greece's restrictions on beer ingredients are similar to Germany's. </TEXT></DOC>
