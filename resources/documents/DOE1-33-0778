A comparison is made of the different effects of surface conductivityand of the drift of ions created in the surrounding gas by backgroundradiation on the rate of neutralization of the surface charge. A novelcharge measurement system which reduces the drift error to 60fC for a60-sec scan is also reported. 3 references, 5 figures.</TEXT></DOC>
