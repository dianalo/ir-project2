Tremolite was markedlyincreased in the occupational group, but only marginally greater in theenvironmentally exposed. Electron-microscopy-derived concentrations ofamphibole fibers longer than 5 microns correlated well with light microscopicasbestos body counts in the occupational group but not in the environmentalor referent groups. Chrysotile concentration was not related to asbestosbody concentration in any group. Crocidolite fiber, a commercial amphibolenot native to the region, was nonetheless identified in lung tissue from15 of 23 chrysotile miners and millers. Environmental exposure to asbestosfiber as a result of residence within 40 km of the mines results in increasedlung chrysotile content.</TEXT></DOC>
