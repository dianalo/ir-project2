The commission's complaint, which was filed in U.S. District Court here, alleged that Earl Brown, of St. Petersburg, misrepresented himself as a certified public accountant in connection with an audit of Acrobe's financial statements in the spring of 1985.    Vincent R. Valles, formerly president and chief executive officer of Acrobe, allegedly &quot;knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that Brown was not a C.P.A.&quot; The SEC further charged that Mr. Valles obtained a copy of a C.P.A. certificate of good standing, altered it to make it appear as if it belonged to Mr. Brown and then sent it to an attorney.    Neither Mr. Valles nor Mr. Brown could be reached for comment.    The agency said Mr. Valles -- without admitting or denying the charges -- consented to a permanent injunction, which enjoins him from further violations of the anti-fraud provisions of federal securities laws. </TEXT></DOC>
