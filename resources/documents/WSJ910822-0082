She grew up in Tokyo and a fancy suburb ofPrinceton, N.J. She trained at figure skating and went toBrown University. So what's a nice girl like Mary-ChapinCarpenter doing in country music?   Very well, thank you, most of Nashville will answer. Toeveryone's surprise, including her own, Ms. Carpenter is thecurrent darling of a music world once disdained by too manyother products of her Eastern Ivy League background. Shebroke to the top of the country music charts without wearingrhinestones or going Grand Ol' Opry. She works fromWashington, D.C., where her parents retired, and she writesher own songs with a cosmopolitan flair marked by her ownforeign travels.</LP><TEXT>   Now 33 years old, Ms. Carpenter spent the years aftergraduation paying her dues in D.C. bars, with occasionalforays on to the college and coffee-house circuit. The5-foot-3 Ivy Leaguer startled her audiences with a rich altoand commanding stage presence. For years she dominated theWhammies, the annual awards of the Washington Area MusicAssociation.   But her sudden success as a national country act stillmakes her laugh in disbelief. Yet it reflects a significantshift in the demographics of country music. Thanks topost-World War II prosperity and social mobility, youngercountry performers often sport college (and evenpost-graduate) degrees, and they're making major inroads inthe upscale market.   Over the last year, the bustling new generation in countrymusic has started to collect its commercial payoff. Countryradio jumped 8% in listener ratings last fall after yearswith little change. Country artists pulled in seven of thetop 10 concert grosses reported in a recent issue ofAmusement Business. And when Billboard magazine changed itssales charts in May to reflect more accurate data, the numberof country albums in the overall top 200 nearly doubled.   The best-selling performers were largely newcomers intheir late 20s and early 30s, such as Garth Brooks, ClintBlack and Alan Jackson. The new generation belies the hayseedstereotype that still dogs Nashville. Instead of farm boysfresh off the bus, you'll find sophisticatedsinger-song-writer-promoters like Lyle Lovett, with a degreein journalism, or Holly Dunn, with a college major inmarketing. Even the impeccably rural Reba McEntire, who spenther youth on her father's ranch and the rodeo circuit, wenton to college, where she studied classical violin and pianoand &quot;analyzed Mozart every which way.&quot;   Privileged backgrounds are no barrier either. Thecountry-rock band Restless Heart, a favorite of countryradio, was organized by a professor of accounting atVanderbilt University. (The professor, Tim DuBois, now runsthe Nashville office of Arista Records.) One of the brightestnew banjo players in bluegrass is a native of Stamford, Conn.named Alison Brown, who earned degrees at Harvard and UCLA.Ms. Brown worked for Smith Barney as an investment bankerbefore joining the Grammy-winning band Union Station.   Identifying with these performers, the upscale college andyoung professional audience is opening up to the rest ofcountry music as well. College radios have become bastions ofhard-core country music. American University's WAMU-FM catersto Washington, D.C.'s, vigorous bluegrass scene. Militantcountry fans in New York City rely on the sophisticatedstudent programmers at WKCR-FM (Columbia University) andWFUV-FM (Fordham) for the harder-edged honky-tonk andtraditional styles spurned by the &quot;soft-country&quot; programmerson commercial AM radio.   Mary-Chapin Carpenter is one of Nashville's prime assetsin reaching this audience. Although she missed taking aGrammy this year, another award at the same time underscoredher importance to the industry. The National Association ofCampus Activities voted her the top country performer in thecollege market.   Part of her appeal comes from her cosmopolitan writing,which can evoke southern France as quickly as the AmericanSouth. Like many students, Ms. Carpenter bummed around Europewith a guitar, and she doesn't hesitate to drop names likeArgeles, a small town near the Pyrenees. Even her ruralAmericana has a literary edge. She drew her highly successful&quot;When Halley Came to Jackson,&quot; about the appearance ofHalley's Comet in Mississippi, from a line in the memoirs ofEudora Welty.   Beyond her music, Ms. Carpenter displays the guilt-riddendrive of her overachieving generation. She copyrights hersongs under the corporate label &quot;Getarealjob Music,&quot; aprivate joke that she says reflects pressure from her peers,not her parents. &quot;When I was a senior,&quot; she says, &quot;I did whateveryone else did. I went to the recruiting office and signedup for the companies that were coming on campus. Of course, Iwas your ultimate liberal arts junky. I bought a suit and Iwent and I sat with these recruiters, and I think they sawright through me. I was kind of unfocused.&quot;   Worried about what she had to show for four years ofcollege and a major in American Studies, Ms. Carpenter wenthome to Washington and started playing the club circuit shehad been working during her summer vacations. &quot;In my mind,&quot;she said, &quot;I imagined, `I can do this and scratch out anearning until I figure out what I want to do.'&quot;   After several years, she nearly let her anxiety drive herout of music. &quot;There was a period of time,&quot; she said, &quot;when Ireally got sick of being a bar singer, and said, `I'm notdoing this anymore. I'm going to get a real job, get healthinsurance and get a life for myself.'&quot;   It was her parents, Ms. Carpenter remembers warmly, whotalked her through her crisis. &quot;They both said, are you sure?The music means a lot to you.&quot; She attributes her success toher middle-class, suburban parents, who rose at the crack ofdawn not to milk the cows, but to drive her to Princeton'sBaker Rink for her figure-skating lessons. &quot;If I didn't haveparents who were supportive of the notion that if you want todo something you should try it,&quot; she said, &quot;I wouldn't besitting here talking to you today about my records.&quot;   In a happy compromise, she landed a job with a smallresearch group in Washington called the Arca Foundation. Hersympathetic boss gave her the flexibility to keep her gigs,her musical appearances.   In the meantime, she made a tape of her songs &quot;to sell outof my back pocket at gigs.&quot; One of her managers sent itaround to record companies and Rounder Records, a majorindependent label, offered a contract. Two days before shesigned, a talent scout from CBS called and asked for a chanceto hear the tape. &quot;He came up that night,&quot; she said. &quot;We lefta copy at his hotel, and he listened to it, and the next dayhe said, `Let's sign.'&quot;   Her first album, &quot;Hometown Girl&quot; came out in 1987 to warmpraise. Her second, the 1989 release &quot;State of the Heart&quot;sealed her reputation as a rising star. It also brought herthe bookings that allowed her to quit her day job. Even withher artistic success, she marvels, she has only been making afull-time living from her music for the past year and a half.   Since its release last year, her third album, &quot;ShootingStraight in the Dark,&quot; has been getting star treatment, withextended videos in heavy rotation. But it was a stillunrecorded song that brought Ms. Carpenter the biggesttriumph of her career. She stunned and delighted an audienceof Nashville's heaviest heavyweights at last October'stelevised Country Music Association Awards show when sheanxiously performed a sarcastic ditty called &quot;You Don't KnowMe.&quot; About the travails of an opening act, the unknown artistwho warms up an audience for the headliner, the song struck anerve, even in its heavily edited television version. &quot;Idon't have a hit on the Billboard charts,&quot; she sang. &quot;I don'thave a limousine that stretches three blocks/ Ready to takeme from door to door. . . .&quot;   She had lunch the next day with Tammy Wynette anddiscovered that even the biggest stars in Nashville keptvivid memories of their opening days.   Ms. Carpenter is just now launching her career as aheadliner. But she will be Nashville's favorite opening actfor some time to come.   ---   Mr. Adams is a former Journal editorialist.</TEXT></DOC>
