North and threeco-defendants charged in the Iran-Contra affair urged a federaljudge on Tuesday to put off their trial until next year to givethem sufficient time to prepare a defense.   Attorneys for North, along with former national security adviserJohn M. Poindexter and two arms dealers, retired Air Force Maj.Gen. Richard V. Secord and Albert Hakim, objected to theprosecution's proposal to begin the trial in July, insteadproposing a March 1989 date.   ``We have a million documents in the case. Evelyn Wood could notread those documents between now and July,'' said North's attorney,Brendan V. Sullivan Jr., referring to the founder of the famousspeed-reading course.   ``There is no conceivable way'' of disposing of the manypretrial issues before early next year, said Sullivan, who proposedthat the trial begin two months after President Reagan leavesoffice.   ``I'm frightened to have a trial during a political electionyear,'' Sullivan told U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell.   Gesell, who said he was concerned about ``having the trial underway while ballots were being cast,'' and independent counselLawrence E. Walsh both proposed starting the trial in July.   Walsh said the trial could take three or four months, butdefense lawyers suggested it could take even longer. ``This is adifficult case,'' Walsh said. But ``it's not going to be made anyeasier by just putting off the trial date.''   The possibility of a presidential pardon for North andPoindexter was not mentioned at the hearing, but it is widelybelieved that the defense would want to take advantage of such apossibility.   The White House has said Reagan has not considered pardons, butthe president has repeatedly said he thought the defendants didnothing illegal.   At the outset of the hearing, Gesell said ``this case is notgoing to be on a slow track. There is no need for it to be on aslow track.''   But a number of obstacles to a summer trial were raised duringthe 3{-hour hearing, the first since the four defendants werearraigned on charges they conspired to illegally divert profits tothe Nicaraguan Contra rebels from the U.S.-Iran arms sales.   These include the issue of whether Walsh obtained evidenceagainst the defendants from their compelled testimony to Congress,as well as a complicated procedure for government review of 300,000classified documents that Gesell ruled should be given to thedefense.   Unless those procedures can be streamlined, ``were talking abouta trial next year at the earliest,'' Gesell said.   Walsh said he could make 50,000 pages available by month's endfollowing a review of the sensitive documents by an interagencytask force for material that might compromise U.S. intelligenceoperations.   Gesell expressed frustration at the detailed review procedureand warned that the case would be dismissed if the governmentdoesn't declassify the documents needed by both the prosecution anddefense.   ``The classification system must be adjusted to the needs ofthis case or the case will collapse,'' Gesell said.   The defendants should have the documents, the judge said,because ``they are entitled to show to the jury what motivatedthem, why they did it, who told them to do it, and what was goingon.''   ``I have to allow them that chance to give them a fair trial.''   Gesell also invited a challenge to the constitutionality of theClassified Information Procedures Act when Barry Simon, one ofNorth's attorneys, complained that the security measures the lawprescribes would hamper defense preparation for trial.   Gesell scheduled an April 25 hearing at which Walsh will outlineprocedures followed by his office to prevent his staff from beingexposed to the congressional testimony of the defendants.   The defense will get an opportunity at that time to presentevidence that at least one witness gave grand jury testimony thatwas influenced by what the defendants told the House and Senatecommittees that investigated the Iran-Contra affair.   The law prohibits Walsh from using the compelled congressionaltestimony of North, Poindexter and Hakim as evidence against them.Unlike his co-defendants, Secord testified on Capitol Hill withouta grant of limited immunity from prosecution.   Gesell warned that he will not proceed to trial unless he issatisfied that Walsh obtained his evidence against the defendantsindependently of their congressional testimony.   ``If we don't have a case to be tried, we are not going to tryit,'' the judge said.   Earlier, Gesell scolded the prosecution for playing a ``cat andmouse'' game by delaying the production of documents he had orderedturned over to the defense.   ``We're not here to play games,'' said Walsh, who added that thedefense already has received more than 30,000 documents, includingthe records of Swiss bank accounts through which the arms saleswere brokered.</TEXT></DOC>
