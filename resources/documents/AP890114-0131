More than 800 people were arrested, policesaid.   In New York, members of the anti-abortion group Operation Rescuecontinued to defy a federal judge's order to stop blocking clinicentrances. Police said 690 people were arrested at demonstrations atsix sites.   Demonstrators chained themselves together to slow police effortsas long ``as we possibly can to save as many babies as we can,''said Bob Chuvala, an Operation Rescue spokesman.   About 72 of the 400 demonstrators blocking the doors of the DeltaWomen's Clinic in New Orleans were arrested on charges ofobstructing a public place, police said. In Toronto, about 80 peoplewere arrested in a demonstration outside the clinic of Dr. HenryMorgentaler, who led the fight for legalized abortion in Canada.   As activists geared up for the anniversary next weekend of the1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion, about 300people braved freezing rain in Cincinnati to attend a rally that didnot involve blocking clinics or being subject to arrest.   ``Our conviction about human dignity tells us that there issomethng in every human person tht is sacred, that is inviolable,that is not ours to dispose of as we see fit,'' Roman CatholicArchbishop Daniel E. Pilarczyk told the crowd Saturday.   In the second day of demonstrations in New York, protesterschanted, lay down, triggered fire alarms and halted elevators, saidInspectorRichard Mayronne, a police spokesman.   Some 500 to 600 people stopped traffic for more than two hourswhile protesting activities of Planned Parenthood's Margaret SangerCenter, said Sgt. Raymond O'Donnell, a police spokesman. About 225demonstrators were arrested.   ``They were lying down and praying in seated positions,''O'Donnell said. ``Most of the people had to be carried. We wouldload some people onto the bus, then other people would run out intothe street and lie in front of the wheels of the bus.''   About 20 to 30 pro-choice activists demonstrated nearby withoutincident, O'Donnell said.   Later Saturday evening, about 100 pro-choice activistsdemonstrated outside St. Patrick's Cathedral, protesting what theycalled Cardinal John O'Connor's support for Operation Rescue.   ``We understand that he is in political, religious andphilosophical agreement with the anti-choice people,'' said MerleHoffman, a founder of the New York Pro-Choice Coalition, whichorganized the counter-protest and was one of the groups that soughtthe judge's order.   ``But we question whether he approves of their terroristtactics,'' she said. ``They are now blatantly defying a federalorder.''   The second biggest protest occurred at Lincoln's Women Services,where police said 175 people were arrested _ most of them carriedaway on stretchers after they refused to walk.   Seven people chained themselves together. They used extra-strongsteel locks, ``but we have equipment that cuts through them likebutter,'' said police Inspector Richard Mayronne.   On Friday, 275 members of the group were arrested in two protestsoutside the Sanger clinic, police said.   U.S. District Judge Robert Ward issued a permanent injunctionagainst the group on Tuesday, forbidding members to obstruct accessto clinics that perform abortions in New York City.   The order calls for a fine of $25,000 a day for violations.   Joan Coombs, deputy executive director of Planned Parenthood,said the organization planned to seek a contempt charge againstOperation Rescue.   In New Orleans, protesters sang hymns and carried wooden crosseswhile waiting to be arrested for blocking the entrance of anabortion clinic.   ``We got here at 6:30 this morning. We shut the place down. Noladies have had abortions today. Look at the lives we've saved,''said Anthony Marquize, director of United for Life.   Terri Bartlett, executive director of Planned Parenthood,disagreed.   ``They're not preventing abortions. They're just delaying themand hurting women who already have had to go through a great deal tomake this decision,'' she said.   Police cleared a path for about a dozen women, some of whom criedand covered their faces, and their companions to enter the clinic asprotesters screamed and chanted.</TEXT></DOC>
