KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Democrats are confident they will keep theircontrolling grip on the U.S. Senate no matter which party wins theWhite House in Tuesday's election.   Party organizers even hope to chip away at Republican Senateseats, perhaps bolstering their 54-46 majority by one or more seats.   Republicans, however, say the momentum is turning in their favorin races across the country, while conceding that every tight racewill have to break in their favor if they are to stand even a chanceof regaining the Senate control they lost two years ago.   Strategists in both parties say an unusual volatility in theelectorate this year adds an element of uncertainty that could leadto election-night surprises.   As the campaign moved into its final hours, GOP Senate candidatesin states in which polling has given Vice President George Bush widemargins over Democratic rival Michael Dukakis have moved to identifythemselves with Bush and his political themes.   Political money flowed freely. The Federal Election Commissionreported that as of Oct. 19, Senate candidates of both parties hadraised a total of $157.5 million.   The most expensive race in the country to date: California, whereSen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., spent more than $10 million andDemocratic Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy spent more than $5 million. Therace was a tossup on the eve of the election.   Overall, it appeared to be a good year for most incumbents, whoattracted the lion's share of campaign contributions. In many oftheir races it appears to be a case of no contest.   Most of the 15 Democratic incumbents seeking re-election appearto be safe, cushioned by leads of 10 or more points. Only three ofthe 12 Republicans seeking further six-year terms appear to be introuble.   Among Democrats, late polling showed Sen. Frank Lautenberg,D-N.J., pulling ahead of former Army Brig. Gen. Pete Dawkins afterweeks of harshly negative campaigning.   Sen. John Melcher, D-Mont., was locked in a head-to-head contestwith rival Republican Conrad Burns with Melcher recycling televisionads featuring talking cows from his 1982 campaign. In this case, thecows call Burns a ``greenhorn'' who would be out of his depth inWashington.   Among Republican incumbents, strong challenges are being mountedfor the seats held by Sen. David Karnes, R-Neb.; Chic Hecht, R-Nev.;and Lowell Weicker, R-Conn. Karnes appeared headed for defeat, whileHecht and Weicker were battling down to the finish.   But much of the action revolves around three of the six seatsbeing vacated by retiring senators, three Republicans and threeDemocrats.   There are clear favorites in Virginia, Mississippi and Vermont.   Former Democratic Gov. Charles Robb is widely expected to capturethe seat being vacated by one-term Sen. Paul Trible, R-Va. Rep.Trent Lott, R-Miss., the House Republican whip, is favored to takethe seat of the Senate's most senior Democrat, John Stennis, who isretiring. And Rep. Jim Jeffords, R-Vt., is favored to win the seatof retiring Sen. Robert Stafford, R-Vt.   The three others _ in Florida, Washington and Wisconsin _ aretossups, and may contain a key to the final outcome of the 1988Senate campaign.   In Wisconsin, millionaire businessman Herb Kohl, the Democrat,has outspent Republican Susan Engeleiter, the minority leader of thestate Senate and held onto a shrinking lead despite criticism he hasnever before held public office.   In Florida, Republican Rep. Connie Mack III was locked in a tightbattle with Democrat Rep. Buddy MacKay for the seat being vacated byDemocrat Lawton Chiles.   A dead heat for the seat being left by Sen. Daniel Evans,R-Wash., has developed between former GOP Sen. Slade Gorton and Rep.Mike Lowry, D-Wash.   Lowry has run a series of negative ads, including one accusingGorton of voting ``against the environment'' in his previous Senateterm.   The Gorton camp retaliated, recruiting Evans for a televisionspot in which he accuses Lowry of distorting Gorton's record andtells him: ``Mike, you've been spreading so much stuff I've had tochange my shoes.''   The camera then pulls back, the picture widens and Evans, dressedin a three-piece business suit, displays dirt-splattered work boots.   Viewing the horseraces, Democratic and Republican strategists sawit this way:   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., chairman of the Senate DemocraticCampaign Committee: ``The Democrats will hold 54 seats at a minimumand I believe have a very good chance to add. ... There is a uniquevolatility in the electorate.''   Tom Mason, spokesman for the Senate Republican CampaignCommittee: ``We are probably more enthusiastic about our chances nowthan at any point in the cycle. We think the momentum is going ourway almost across the board. But we will have to win all the closeones. ... But it's still quite volatile out there and we could stillend up on Election Day minus two. But we could just as easily beplus two or better.''</TEXT></DOC>
