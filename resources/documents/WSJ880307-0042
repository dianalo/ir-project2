Japanese government officials said they received a confidential notice Friday outlining recommendations by a GATT panel in Geneva that has been studying a European Community appeal against the U.S.-Japan chip pact. The pact calls for Japan to stop its alleged dumping of computer chips and to buy more foreign chips.    Officials at Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry, or MITI, wouldn't disclose the GATT panel's findings. But major Japanese daily newspapers reported that the panel has found that Japan is violating GATT rules by propping up prices of the chips it exports to countries other than the U.S.    More than 100 countries belong to GATT, whose machinery includes a set of rules for liberalizing trade and procedures for mediating trade disputes.    To carry out the U.S.-Japan semiconductor agreement, signed in September 1986, MITI has been &quot;monitoring&quot; the prices at which traders export certain Japanese chips. The ministry urges traders to export chips at above fair-price levels determined by it and usually denies export licenses to those that don't.    The ministry's scheme boosted chip prices around the world early last year, angering companies that bought those chips to build into their computers and other products. The EC, whose 12 member countries are heavy users of chips but produce relatively few of them, filed an appeal with GATT in late 1986 charging that Japan's monitoring constitutes illegal export control. MITI has consistently denied the allegations.    The appeal also charges that the U.S.-Japan pact calls for market-access steps that favor U.S. chip makers. Japanese news reports Sunday said the GATT panel had found that Japan's market-access steps aren't biased toward U.S. makers.    Ministry officials said Friday's GATT recommentations would go before the GATT council, probably in May, for a final ruling. But &quot;our objective is an amicable settlement,&quot; before it gets that far, a ministry official said.    Officials of the Semiconductor Industry Association, a trade group representing U.S. chip companies, said they weren't surprised by the apparent GATT action because the EC's appeal had been under consideration for so long.    The SIA contends that any anti-dumping actions should be imposed on all world markets, and not just in the U.S. &quot;Otherwise, the U.S. would be an island of high prices in a sea of dumping, and the result would be that our electronics industry wouldn't be competitive,&quot; said Daryl Hatano, the SIA's director of international trade and government affairs.    A ruling against Japan's chip-monitoring system would have serious implications for the way Japan pacifies irate trading partners. The ministry has few legal means to control exports, so it depends heavily on informal &quot;administrative guidance.&quot;    MITI guidance, for example, orchestrates &quot;voluntary&quot; restraints of automobile exports to the U.S. And when the U.S. complained in late 1986 that cheap Japanese chips were leaking into the U.S. from Japan's domestic market, ministry officals began compiling detailed quarterly projections that became de facto production quotas for Japanese companies. MITI also monitors Japan's exports to the EC of color televisions, machine tools and automobiles.    In Washington, the White House had no public comment on the reports from Japan. Officials said the panel's recommendation was supposed to remain secret until March 17, to give the European Community and Japan time to work out a settlement and avoid formal GATT action. The U.S. isn't officially a party to the case.    However, it's understood that, in the U.S. view, the recommendation doesn't invalidate the portion of the U.S.-Japanese pact curbing the dumping of chips in third countries, but merely Tokyo's manner of carrying out that pledge.    The U.S. is expected to take the position that there is room in the agreement for the Japanese government to use other, unspecified, methods to carry out its promise to the U.S. that Japanese chips won't be dumped in third countries.    President Reagan already has removed many of the penalties associated with the pact, because of progress on the dumping issue. The U.S. believes the other part of the pact, guaranteeing U.S. chip makers access to Japan's own market, hasn't been carried out by Tokyo, and sanctions tied to the access issue remain in effect.    ---   Brenton R.
