However, there is a safeguard in the bill providing that the trade representative's action is &quot;subject to the specific direction, if any, of the President.&quot; The purpose of this change in the law is not to &quot;sabotage&quot; presidential authority, as you suggest, but to bring greater effectiveness, coherence and accountability to U.S. trade policy. The change will give our top trade negotiator more clout both in the U.S. government and in negotiations with other countries.    Given the reality that it is not the president who ultimately will make all trade decisions, it does make a difference which cabinet officer has primary responsibility in a given area. For example, shifting administration of the countervailing duty and anti-dumping laws to Commerce from Treasury in 1979 made a real difference in the determination of our government to implement these laws.    Vesting trade decision-making authorities in a named cabinet officer will not be to the exclusion by any means of nationalsecurity or foreign-policy issues. These policies will still receive full attention in the cabinet committee review process.    The bill's provisions are likely to make trade a higher priority in this country. Strengthening the voice of the spokesman for trade in the councils of our executive branch and in international trade negotiations is one of the subtle, yet important, changes in the bill that can make a difference for the U.S.    Sen.
