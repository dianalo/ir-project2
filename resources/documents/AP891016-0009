Jerry's fury combined with the highest tides of the year toflood coastal areas as thousands of people, mostly in Louisiana,fled to higher ground.   The center of the hurricane moved ashore on the west end ofGalveston Island about 7:25 p.m., with sustained winds of 75 mphand gusts up to 100 mph, according to the National Hurricane Centerin Coral Gables, Fla.   In Galveston, a 32-mile long barrier island connected to themainland by a causeway, officials reported scattered powerfailures, street flooding and a roof torn off a building, alongwith numerous downed trees and neon signs.   Late Sunday, the bodies of a man and a small child were foundfloating near the city's seawall, said Gary Stone, a spokesman forGalveston's Emergency Operations Center. He said the victims, whocould not be identified immediately, were believed to eitherpassengers in a car that washed over the seawall or pedestrians.   There were no other immediate reports of injuries.   Glass windows in an apartment complex on the island's west endwere blown out, and several balconies were torn off.   ``The winds blew threw the glass of several of these apartmentsand blew the gutters down,'' said John Harsh, a resident of thecomplex who had been without power since 7:30 p.m. ``Wholebalconies came down, it just ripped them up from the bolts.''   At the historic Galvez Hotel, the management said guests wouldhave to spend the night in the lobby because several rooms hadbroken glass inside.   Houston Lighting andamp; Power spokeswoman Graham Painter said 52,000customers were without power Sunday night, most of them onGalveston.   The city of 62,000 was the site of one of the worst hurricanesin U.S. history, a storm that killed an estimated 6,000 people in1900. Galveston Island is about 50 miles south of Houston.   By 11 p.m., Jerry was downgraded to a tropical storm as maximumsustained winds decreased to 70 mph. The storm's center was locatedabout 40 miles north of Galveston near Baytown, Texas, or nearlatitude 29.6 degrees north, longitude 94.6 west.   The storm was moving northeast at 14 mph and was expected tobrush past the southeast side of Houston while steadily losingpower over land, meteorologists said. Rainfall totals of 3 to 5inches were expected along the path during the next 12 to 24 hours.   Jerry was considered a category 1 hurricane, the least severepossible. Hurricane Hugo, which devastated Charleston and otherparts of South Carolina last month, was a category 4.   ``I think that we did very well,'' Galveston Mayor JanCoggeshall said after the hurricane had passed over the islandafter a two-hour mauling.   ``I think we're going to find some damage, but I don't thinkit's going to be as significant as it could have been. I think weare going to suffer a lot of erosion on the west end beaches,'' hesaid.   City leaders said a team of officials would begin surveyingdamage to the area at 6 a.m. Monday.   As Jerry struck, heavy rains and rising tides moved over theupper Texas coast and were expected to increase over the southwestLouisiana coast, the National Weather Service said.   The hurricane center said the area would receive 4 to 8 inchesof rain.   Jerry's hurricane-strength winds extended 25 miles east of theeye and 15 miles west. That was about 10 times weaker than Hugo,which packed hurricane force winds extending 100 miles out from itscenter.   ``It's a very small hurricane. I would not expect much damagefrom it,'' said Bob Sheets, director of the National HurricaneCenter.   ``Category 4 is a major disaster and Jerry is a bad day,'' saidJerry Jarrell, deputy director of the center.   Jerry strengthened from a tropical storm to a hurricane 110miles off Galveston Island at 1 p.m. when its sustained wind hit 75mph, or 1 mph above the threshold, according to the NationalHurricane Center. During the afternoon, the storm reached 85 mphsustained wind and swung onto a northerly course toward Galveston,the hurricane center said.   The storm surge caused by a combination of Jerry and high tideswas not expected to be over eight feet, he said. In comparison, thestorm surge in the Charleston, S.C., area from Hugo was up to 20feet.   Hurricane warnings were posted from Freeport, Texas, toIntracoastal City, La. Tornado watches were issued for southwesternLouisiana and southeastern Texas.   Several tornadoes were spotted between Galveston and Houston,damaging some buildings. No injuries were immediately reported.   A tornado hit downtown Orange, near the Louisiana border, andseveral homes and businesses were damaged, police officials said.There were no reports of injuries, police dispatcher Rachel Timaeussaid.   Earlier, a funnel cloud was reported near New Orleans.   Galveston City Manager Doug Matthews, who ordered an 11 p.m.curfew, said he believed many of the island city's residentsdecided to stay in their homes behind the seawall. He said about500 residents left their low-lying homes on the island's west end,which is not protected by the seawall.   Several cars were tossed onto sidewalks and there was a reportof one washing over the seawall, but officials did not know ifanyone was inside. The wind also blew out the windows of a policecar, but the officer was not injured.   Earlier, workers distributed sandbags and barricades tolow-lying areas, and residents stocked up on supplies and securedhomes and boats.   In Louisiana's southwestern corner, the Cameron Parish CivilDefense Office ordered coastal areas evacuated, and spokesman ScottHenry said that affected 8,000 to 10,000 people.   ``We're anticipating extremely high tides, plus we'll be in thestorm push for the tidal surge,'' said Henry.   Even without the hurricane, tides were expected to peak thisweek because of the relative positions of the sun, moon and theEarth.   High tide at Galveston, which arrives around sunset and justbefore sunrise, is 1{ to 2 feet above sea level. Astronomical tidewas expected to add about a foot, and storm surge 4 to 7 feet,forecasters said.   ``Our main concern is we only have two or three roads out of theparish,'' said Henry of Cameron Parish. High tides ``could cut offseveral escapes routes. As night comes, if you hadn't already gotout, it could cause problems.''   An evacuation center was set up by the Red Cross at LakeCharles-Boston High School, but only 48 people had checked in bylate Sunday.   ``Cameron evacuates four times a year. I don't think they wereworried about this one,'' said Mary Touchette, the center's manager.   Offshore oil operations pulled hundreds of workers in from theGulf of Mexico.   Chevron spokesman Jim Lajaunie said Sunday the 250 offshoreworkers from the company's base in Amelia, La., were moved to dryland. Mobil Oil spokesman Bill Barnard said about 600 workers werecalled in in southwestern Louisiana.</TEXT></DOC>
