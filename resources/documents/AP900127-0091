Any tourists wishing to visit the Vista Hotel, where Barryallegedly smoked crack cocaine, first will have to pass signsadvising them that they are entering the ``nation's last colony.''   Barry's arrest Jan. 18 on a federal charge of possessing cocainehas focused attention on his crumbling political fortunes and apossible mayoral candidacy by Jesse Jackson. But it has alsostirred a quieter debate over the impact on a long-moribund driveto make the city the 51st state.   ``Clearly this sets that back,'' Rep. Stan Parris, R-Va., a citycritic, said last week after Barry's arrest. ``There is not anorganized crescendo'' (against home rule), he said. ``There is anincreased discussion about whether this thing is really working.''   Jackson has taken up the statehood cause, regardless of whetherit leads to a personal candidacy.   ``Maryland was not disenfranchised when (Gov. Marvin) Mandelwent to jail,'' the two-time Democratic presidential hopeful saidlast week. ``There is no valid argument for denying statehood tothe nearly 700,000 people who live here.''   Residents of the District of Columbia have no votingrepresentatives in Congress, even though the city claims a largerpopulation than either Delaware, North Dakota, Vermont or Wyoming.The city's budget must be approved by Congress, and the House andSenate have permanent committees to oversee the district's affairs.   Congress approved home rule in 1974 _ Barry is only the city'ssecond mayor to be elected _ but took back some of the powers 15years later.   Both houses passed a proposed constitutional amendment forstatehood in 1978, but it expired seven years later when only 16 ofthe required 38 states ratified it.   New legislation is expected to be introduced in Congress againin the near future.   But before the district's chances for statehood are improved,touchy issues having nothing to do with the mayor need to beresolved. One is the question of whether the city should still getan annual payment from the federal government. Another is thedifficulty of winning Republican support for statehood when thedistrict, with its overwhelmingly black population, almostcertainly would wind up with two Democratic senators.   The view from the pro-statehood forces, not surprisingly, isthat Barry's arrest will not do lasting harm.   ``We will persevere,'' said Josephine Butler, chairwoman of thedistrict's statehood commission.   ``His arrest is important, but it is a short-term thing, whilestatehood is enduring. Statehood has been a long and tediousprocess, and we will overcome this and our other problems.''   The board is advertising the city's unique status with roadsigns that say, ``Welcome to the Nation's Last Colony. Allresidents must leave their rights at the border. D.C. StatehoodNow.''   Walter Fauntroy, the city's non-voting delegate in the House,sees a possible silver lining in Barry's difficulties. Envisioninga city with a new mayor, Fauntroy said, ``Members of Congress whowould use a man who admittedly has a problem ... no longer havethat excuse.''   Whatever the impact on the city, there is no doubting the effecton Barry's fortunes.   Longtime Barry fund-raiser Robert Johnson, president of BlackEntertainment Television, said he would not back any re-electioneffort by the mayor. Several influential ministers said likewise,as did a prominent business group that has supported the city'sleader in the past.   Barry, who entered a private treatment facility in West PalmBeach, Fla., for what an aide said was treatment of alcoholism, hasnot said publicly what his political plans are, but sources havesaid he has said he would not seek a new term.   With each new sign that Barry's political career may be doomed,more attention is paid to Jackson, whose move to the nation'scapital last year fueled rumors that he might make a bid for themayor's chair.   Through the week, the mystery surrounding Jackson remained thesame: he said time and again that he is not interested in runningfor mayor; he also repeatedly refused to rule out the possibilitythat he might get into the race if Barry bows out.   ``A public servant ... never says never,'' Jackson said.   Meanwhile, a group of prominent local labor leaders andbusinessmen held a pair of meetings to devise a draft-Jacksonstrategy; a separate group of attorneys did the same thing.</TEXT></DOC>
