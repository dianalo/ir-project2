As part of the implementation ofthis goal, this final rule prohibits any recipient involvement in redistrictingactivities, as defined in the rule, because basic day-to-day legal servicesto the poor are not advanced by redistricting activities and redistrictingis intertwined with impermissible political activity. The rule is intendedto ensure that recipients refrain from becoming involved in any redistrictingactivity, including anything intended to influence the timing or mannerof the taking of a census, since such activity is not consistent with theCorporation's principal national goal for the provision of legal assistance.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>September 5, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: </T2>Timothy B.

Inresponse, a total of 75 comments were received. After considering writtencomments and hearing public comment on the proposed regulation at its meetingin Alexandria, Virginia, on April 13, 1989, the LSC Board of Directors'Committee on Operations and Regulations voted to recommend the proposedrule with clarifying amendments to the full Board. On April 14, 1989, theLSC Board adopted the Committee recommendations with clarifying amendments.Briefly, the rule prohibits Corporation, recipient, or subrecipient involvementin any redistricting activities. ``Involvement'' means the use or contributionof LSC or private funds, personnel, or equipment in redistricting activities,and ``redistricting'' means any direct or indirect effort to participatein the revision or reapportionment of a legislative, judicial, or electivedistrict at any level of government, including the timing or manner ofthe taking of a census. Amendments to the proposed rule adopted by theBoard clarify that: (1) Voting Rights Act litigation is permissible aslong as it does not involve redistricting; (2) the restrictions in therule do not prevent recipients from using public or tribal funds for thepurposes for which they were provided; (3) employees of recipients maybe involved in redistricting activities as long as such involvement doesnot make use of program resources or time, does not involve identificationwith the program, and is outside the context of advice and representation;and (4) the rule does not prohibit activities permitted by 45 CFR Part1604, LSC's regulation on outside practice of law. The rule is intended to ensure that recipients refrain from becoming involvedin rendering any legal services affecting redistricting, since such servicesare not consistent with the Corporation's principal national goal of theprovision of basic day-to-day legal services to eligible poor individuals.Redistricting matters are not peculiar to the interests of the poor, norhave they been identified as a priority by LSC recipients. In addition,recipient funds can be better used elsewhere, since alternative organizationsare available to handle redistricting matters. Further, recipients wouldlikely be competing with members of the private bar who handle matterssuch as these, since redistricting cases usually generate attorneys' fees.Finally, redistricting risks entanglement with political activities, whichLSC recipients should assiduously avoid. Generally, commenters opposed the new rule on the grounds that LSC lacksauthority to restrict redistricting activities by its grantees, especiallywith regard to the use of private funds; that the proposed rule conflictswith other statutory authority that permits legal representation in suchcases; that the definition of ``redistricting'' is too broad; that theCorporation's justifications for the need to restrict redistricting activitiesare faulty; and that the effect of the rule will be to deny poor personsaccess to legal assistance necessary to protect some of their most fundamentallegal rights. <T3>Authority to establish goals. </T3>Section 1007(a)(2)(C) of the LegalServices Corporation Act, Pub. L. 93-355, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 2996, <T3>et seq., </T3>gives the Corporation authority not only to establishnational goals, but also to determine that a specific activity may notbe undertaken by LSC recipients where the activity does not advance Corporationgoals. Under section 1007(a)(2)(C), 42 U.S.C. 2996f(a)(2)(C), the Corporationmust ensure that recipients, ``consistent with goals established by theCorporation, adopt procedures for determining and implementing prioritiesfor the provision of such [legal] assistance.'' This statutory languagegives the Corporation authority to establish goals that constrain the freedomof local programs to set service priorities, because it requires that recipients'priorities be in accord with the Corporation's goals. The fact that thisrule is cast as a prohibition, therefore, does not detract from its effectof advancing a Corporation goal. Certainly, this prohibition can hardly be called unduly intrusive, sinceit otherwise leaves programs free to determine which cases they will take.This new rule is simply a modest step in the direction of establishingthe primacy of basic day-to-day service, and as such it advances the overalleffective use of recipients' resources.The legislative history supports the proposition that, while recipientsmay establish substantive law priorities, such priorities must comportwith any goals established by the Corporation. When recipients were giventhe role of establishing local priorities by the 1977 amendments to theLSC Act, the House and Senate committee reports discussed the recipients'obligation in the context that such priorities must be consistent withLSC national goals. H. Rep. 310, 95th Cong., lst Sess. 10-11 (1977); S.Rep. 172, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 13 (1977). Thus, contrary to the tenorof certain comments, nothing in the legislative history undercuts the Act'sclear grant of authority to the Corporation to determine that certain activitiesso marginally contribute to effective use of program resources that theyfall outside the Corporation's goals. The restriction on redistrictingactivity sets out one perimeter limiting the provision of legal assistanceon the grounds that such activity falls outside the goals of the Corporation.<T3>Authority to promulgate legislative rules. </T3>To the extent thispart constitutes a legislative rule,\1\<NOTE/> the Corporation has   ample authority to promulgate it. Reviewof the LSC Act as an integrated whole and consideration of its language,logic, and legislative history confirm that Congress delegated broad generallegislative rulemaking authority to the Corporation. A legislative rulecreates new law, rights, or duties, while an interpretive rule simply stateswhat an agency thinks the statute means and reminds affected parties ofexisting duties, <T3>Chrysler Corp. </T3>v. <T3>Brown</T3>, 441 U.S. 281, 302 (1979); <T3>General Motors Corp. </T3>v. <T3>Ruckelshaus</T3>, 742 F.2d 1561, 1565 (D.C. Cir. 1984). Because thelegislative power of the United States is vested in Congress, the exerciseof quasi-legislative power by governmental entities must be rooted in agrant of such power by Congress, <T3>Chrysler Corp.</T3>, 441 U.S. at 302; <T3>American Postal Workers Union, AFL-CIO </T3>v. <T3>United States Postal Service</T3>, 707 F.2d 548, 558 (D.C.

In order to decide whether legislative rulemakingauthority has been delegated by Congress, the language, logic, and legislativehistory of the enabling act should be probed, <T3>Chrysler Corp. </T3>441 U.S. at 308, and the act should be read asan integrated whole, <T3>National Petroleum Refiners Association </T3>v. <T3>F.T.C.</T3>, 482 F.2d 672, 677-78 (D.C. Cir. 1973). Finally, the factthat Congress includes specific grants of legislative rulemaking authoritydoes not eviscerate a grant of general legislative rulemaking authority.<T3>In re Permanent Surface Mining Regulation Litigation </T3>v. <T3>Peabody Coal Company</T3>, 653 F.2d 514, 523 (D.C. Cir. 1981), <T3>cert. denied, </T3>454 U.S. 822 (1981).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Comments have not identified those portions of the rulethat are legislative. Generally, LSC considers the rule to be interpretiveas it simply states LSC's interpretation of what the LSC Act means. LSC'sgoal is based on its policy to give primacy to the provision of basic day-to-daylegal assistance to eligible poor persons. Section 1007(a)(2)(C) requiresthe Corporation to establish goals to ensure that recipients' prioritiesare in accordance with its policy goals. Although extension of this ruleto private funds may arguably be legislative in nature, the Corporationreads section 1007(a)(2)(C), which mandates establishment of prioritiesby recipients, as extending priorities to private resources as well asLSC funds. See discussion <T3>infra</T3>. LSC's general authority to promulgate legislative rules and its specificauthority to legislate in regard to redistricting activities are rootedin sections 1006(a), 1006(b)(1)(A), and 1007(a)(2)(C) of the LSC Act. Section1006(a) delegates to the Corporation to the extent consistent with theprovisions of the Act all ``the powers conferred upon a nonprofit corporationby the District of Columbia Nonprofit Corporation Act'' except the powerto dissolve itself. 42 U.S.C. 2996e(a). The Act intended the Corporationto be structured and financed in a way that would assure its substantialindependence and freedom from both executive and legislative politicalinterference. S. Rep. 495, 93d Cong., 1st Sess. 2-7 (1973). As a nonprofitcorporation, LSC has broad discretion to make substantive, interpretive,and procedural policy and legal decisions that are legislative in nature,as long as they are reasonably related to the purposes of the enablingact. <T3>See, e.g., National Clearinghouse </T3>v. <T3>Legal Services Corporation, </T3>674 F.Supp. 37, 41 (D.D.C. 1987);<T3>aff'd, </T3>861 F.2d 303 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (one of the LSC Board's principalfunctions is to set funding policy). The Act gives ample authority to the Corporation to express and implementits legislative decisions through the regulatory process. In conjunctionwith the authority delegated to LSC in section 1006(a), section 1006(b)(1)(A)gives the Corporation broad general oversight and rulemaking authority.\2\<NOTE/> The legislative history of this provision evidences grantof legislative authority to the Corporation. When explaining the independentstructure of the Corporation as envisioned in Senate bill, S. 2686, SenatorJavits explained that the Corporation was given ``very strong authority''to enforce the provisions of the Act by promulgating regulations and ensuringthe maintenance of the highest quality of service and professional standards.119 Cong. Rec. S22413 (Dec. 10, 1973). He considered that Congress shouldnot watch over or interfere with decisions made by the Corporation exceptin extreme cases. <T3>Id. </T3>at S22413-22414. A logical reading of the scope of authorityand discretion envisioned in sections 1006(a) and 1006(b)(1)(A) requiresthe conclusion that LSC was intended to be more than an entity with onlyinterpretive authority; it was expected to make substantive legal and policydecisions that would then be implemented through legislative rules.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Section 1006(b)(1)(A) provides that: <ITAG tagnum="28">The Corporation shall have the authority to insure the complianceof recipients and their employees with the provisions of this title andthe rules, regulations, and guidelines promulgated pursuant to this title,and to terminate, after a hearing . . . financial support to a recipientwhich fails to comply. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">42 U.S.C. 2996e(b)(1)(A). </ITAG>One type of substantive decisionmaking authority given to LSC is the authorityin section 1007(a)(2)(C) to establish national goals. If the Corporationhas authority to establish   such goals, then it necessarily must haveauthority to issue rules to implement these goals and to ensure that recipients'priorities are in accord with them, as contemplated by section 1006(b)(1)(A).In summary, Congress clearly intended to create an independent organizationwith broad authority to make and implement legislative policy and legaldecisions.<T3>Relevant provisions in the LSC Act.</T3> There are no provisions inthe LSC Act that expressly give LSC recipients authority to engage in redistrictingactivities. Contrary to assertions made by some commenters, the fact thatCongress contemplated that some litigation could be brought under the VotingRights Act pursuant to section 1007(a)(6) of the LSC Act does not supportthe contention that redistricting litigation was necessarily contemplated.Likewise, exceptions to prohibitions on types of legal assistance activitiesin the Act do not provide authority, as asserted by comments, for recipientsto engage in certain types of redistricting activities. <T3>A. Authority pursuant to section 1007(a)(6).</T3> LSC's authority toprohibit all redistricting activities does not conflict with activitiesallowed under exceptions to the prohibitions on political activity in section1007(a)(6) of the LSC Act.\3\<NOTE/> Rather than granting recipients affirmative authority toengage in redistricting activities, the exceptions merely allow a narrowarea of activity, <T3>i.e.,</T3> legal advice and representation for individuals seekinginformation on and access to the polls and to voter registration.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Section 1007(a)(6) obligates the Corporation to insurethat all recipient attorneys engaged in legal assistance activities refrainfrom:  <ITAG tagnum="28">(A) Any political activity, or (B) any activity to provide votersor prospective voters with transportation to the polls or provide similarassistance in connection with an election (other than legal advice or representation),or (C) any voter registration activity (other than legal advice and representation).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">42 U.S.C. 2996f(a)(6). </ITAG>Commenters asserted that this provision, supported by its legislative history,contemplates legal assistance for eligible clients brought under the VotingRights Act, 42 U.S.C. 1973, including redistricting litigation. This contentionis not supported by the plain language of the statute or its legislativehistory. The plain language of the section makes no reference to redistricting.Section 1007(a)(6) first establishes in clause (A) a blanket prohibitionon involvement in political activities. In clauses (B) and (C), however,two narrow exceptions permit legal advice and representation for complaintsrelating to access to polls (<T3>e.g.,</T3> transportation to the polls or a similar activity) or anyvoter registration activity. Nothing in this language expressly contemplatesinvolvement in redistricting litigation. Nor is there any reference to redistricting in the legislative historyof this provision. The extent of permissible and impermissible activitiescontemplated by section 1007(a)(6) was addressed in a colloquy on the Senatefloor during consideration of amendments to delete the exceptions permittinglegal advice and representation for voter access or registration activities.120 Cong. Rec. S918-921 (January 31, 1974). Activities described as prohibitedby the section included soliciting individuals or clients for a particularpolitical cause and organizing carpools to take voters to the polls. <T3>Id.</T3> The types of activities intended to be permitted under theexceptions were legal advice and representation for eligible clients seekingaccess to the polls and voter registration and information on their rightto participate in the electoral process. <T3>Id.</T3> at S918-S921. While Senator Taft made one reference to thefact that individuals should be able to get legal advice as to their rightsunder the Voting Rights Act, he made no mention of redistricting activities.<T3>Id.</T3> This rule will not prevent advice and representation with respect to thetypes of voter access issues contemplated in the language of section 1007(a)(6),including most cases brought under the Voting Rights Act. However, althoughredistricting cases are often brought under the Voting Rights Act, therule identifies redistricting as being so entangled with political considerationsthat it is more akin to the matters outside the scope of the exceptionsthan to issues of simple access. <T3>B. Exceptions to prohibitions.</T3> The LSC enabling and appropriationsacts provide ample authority for a blanket prohibition of all redistrictingactivities, even though certain exceptions in the acts would allow certaintypes of legal assistance activities that are prohibited in this part.For example, the LSC enabling and funding acts contain general prohibitionson lobbying activities but provide certain exceptions, such as one forlegislative lobbying when such lobbying is carried out on behalf of aneligible client or upon the request of a legislator. <T3>See</T3> 42 U.S.C. 2996f(a)(5); and Pub. L. 100-459, 102 Stat. 2223-2224(1988). Commenters assert that these exceptions provide authority to lobbyon redistricting matters when the lobbying activity is done on behalf ofan eligible client. First, these provisions are cast as exceptions to prohibitions. Such exceptions,by their terms, do not constitute affirmative mandates to engage in theexcepted activities; rather, they merely define those activities that arenot prohibited as lobbying per se. Thus, these exceptions do not give affirmativeauthority for recipients to lobby in any substantive area, such as redistrictingmatters, when the lobbying is done on behalf of an eligible client. Second, the LSC Act clearly differentiates between prohibitions on programinvolvement in certain substantive areas of law, such as criminal law,desertion from the military, and procurement of non-therapeutic abortions,and prohibitions on the types of legal assistance activities that can becarried out, <T3>i.e.,</T3> lobbying, training, community education, and organizing.As a general rule, if the LSC Act contains a prohibition against involvementin an area of law, then <T3>all</T3> types of legal assistance in that area are prohibited.\4\<NOTE/> For example, the prohibition on representation in criminalcases precludes a recipient from using LSC funds to train attorneys inthis area of law or to conduct community education. Accordingly, prohibitionson involvement in substantive areas of the law apply even where the eligibleclient exceptions might otherwise permit representation.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ ``Legal assistance'' refers to all legal services providedby recipients under the Act, including training, community education, directrepresentation, and research.Finally, however, 45 CFR 1612.1(h) includes activity intended to influencethe structure of government itself, such as reapportionment, within themeaning of legislative lobbying. Such lobbying is prohibited, and no exceptionis provided for eligible clients or requests of legislators. See 45 CFR1612.4(b).Thus, the determination to prohibit any redistricting even with an eligibleclient or a request of a legislator is well within existing precedent.<T3>Private Funds.</T3> The Corporation has ample authority to apply thisrule's prohibition to private funds. First, LSC's authority to restrictredistricting activities is rooted in a statutory mandate that is not dependenton what funds are used, or even whether or not any funds are used for theactivity. The statutory requirement in section 1007(a)(2)(C) that the Corporation ensure that recipients establish priorities in accord withthe Corporation's goals is not tied to the use of LSC funds. Rather, itis an affirmative requirement that attaches to the program regardless ofwhether LSC or private funds are used. For this reason, Part 1620, LSC'sregulation implementing section 1007(a)(2) of the Act, applies to all ofa recipient's resources. <T3>See</T3> 45 CFR 1620.2(a) and (b)(3) and 1620.5(b).Likewise, the prohibitions on political activities in section 1007(a)(6)apply to the activities and are not limited by consideration of what fundsare used. Of course, section 1007(a)(6) activities are already listed asbeing within the scope of section 1010(c) of the LSC Act, which prohibitsthe use of private funds for such activities. <T3>See </T3>45 CFR Part 1610. However, a violation of this provision couldoccur regardless of whether any specific funds are used, since the prohibitionis directed against the activity, not against the use of funds for suchactivity. In summary, the prohibition of any redistricting activity regardless ofthe source of funds used is consistent with other prohibitions in the Act.<T3>Policy Considerations Bearing on the Regulation of Redistricting. </T3>Substantialpolicy considerations warranted LSC's determination that redistrictingactivities are not consistent with the Corporation's principal nationalgoal of providing basic day-to-day legal services to eligible poor individuals.Basic services include those that provide an immediate and discrete benefitto eligible clients with specific complaints such as child support, adoption,child abuse, and other family law matters; consumer complaints; and landlordtenant disputes, rather than services aimed at broad social and legal reform.The more esoteric cases, aimed at changing political and social structureswith the hope that such changes will eventually benefit the poor, haveevoked much public and Congressional criticism, because the benefits tothe poor are often attenuated and entangled with social or political issues.Redistricting activity falls outside day-to-day legal services for thereasons set out below. First, redistricting cases are not peculiar to the interests of the poor,since the relief sought would affect entire communities, which are composedof poor and non-poor individuals. Since the poor represent a minority,approximately 10 to 15 percent of the United States population, the groupof eligible poor in most communities is relatively small. While it is possibleto find localities in which a majority of citizens are eligible clients,as pointed out in some comments, in most localities less than 15 percentof the population is denominated as poor. In addition, since most redistrictingcases are class actions and certainly affect large blocks of residents,the putative plaintiff class often may consist of a majority of non-eligibleindividuals. Similarly, the relief sought in redistricting cases oftenwould go to the non-poor. Even in redistricting cases involving discriminationissues, the relief sought would not always go primarily to eligible poorindividuals, as only part of the protected minority may be eligible. Consequently,the expenditure of recipients' funds on redistricting activities commonlywould result in an allocation of resources for the benefit of non-eligiblepersons. Second, redistricting cases generally have not been identified as a priorityby LSC recipients. A compilation of the types of cases handled by LSC recipientsin 1987 reveals that approximately 27 percent of the cases involved familymatters, 21 percent involved housing matters, 16 percent involved incomemaintenance issues, and 12 percent were consumer-related cases. <T3>See </T3>Legal Services Corporation 1987/1988 Fact Book at 65. However,the need for this rule is supported by the fact that, regardless of redistricting'snon-priority status in the past, LSC recipients have committed substantialresources to redistricting issues. Specifically, the Corporation estimatesthat at least 28,000 hours were devoted to handling redistricting casesfrom 1978 to 1984, years surrounding the 1980 census. Suggestions thatredistricting might be included in a recipient's ``other issues'' categoryof priorities simply underlines this area as one lacking special concernto clients. Of the 73 comments submitted on the proposed rule, only twostated that their programs are presently involved in redistricting casesand only 10 cited previous involvement in such cases. Three recipients_LegalAid Society of Central Texas, California Rural Legal Assistance, and MississippiLegal Services Coalition_said that voting rights or redistricting casesare a priority for their programs. Third, LSC has determined that recipient funds can be better used elsewhere,since alternative organizations and private attorneys are available tohandle redistricting matters. Redistricting cases usually offer incentivesto members of the private bar, since under the Voting Rights Act, 42 U.S.C.1973, and the Civil Rights Attorneys' Fees Award Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C.1981 and 1988, the right to recover attorneys' fees is specifically givento prevailing parties. Redistricting matters are also undertaken by numerousorganizations, including the Mexican American Legal Defense Fund, the SouthwestVoters Registration Project, Common Cause, the American Civil LibertiesUnion, the Native American Rights Fund, the NAACP, the Lawyers Committeefor Civil Rights, the League of Women Voters, the Democratic National Committee,and the Republican National Committee. In comments to LSC's proposed rule,several of these organizations conceded that they are heavily involvedin redistricting issues, but they claim, without evidence, that there isstill a substantial unmet need for which alternative representation isunavailable. Referring to the upcoming 1990 census, one such commenterstated that massive efforts will be required to scrutinize ``all of theplans'' resulting from redistricting in thousands of jurisdictions nationwide.While it may be true that representation may be unavailable for all casesor in some geographic areas, such comments confirm LSC's assertion thatmany civil rights organizations already handle redistricting matters bothon a national and local level. Comments that massive efforts will be requiredin the next decade for redistricting activities, including litigation thatrequires inordinate amounts of resources and time, reinforce the need toregulate in this area, since these activities would most certainly drawresources away from the provision of basic day-to-day legal services. Itis simply not effective and economical to channel legal services fundsinto a massive effort that does not primarily affect the poor and thatis already the object of considerable attention from private attorneysand interest groups.Fourth, in the past, involvement in redistricting activities by legal servicesrecipients has been subject to abuse, because legal services recipientshave linked redistricting activities to obtaining favorable Congressionalsupport for their own parochial objectives. One LSC recipient's grant proposaladdressed the need to become involved in State and local redistrictingmatters in order to develop powerful allies for its clients in what therecipient viewed as a battle over the direction of legal services programs.Influencing redistricting in State and local legislative bodies clearlyaffects the political character of those legislative bodies. In response to requests made on April 11 and May 10, 1984, by the SenateCommittee on Labor and Human Resources, LSC conducted a study of its granteesto determine their involvement in legislative redistricting activitiesarising out of the 1980 census. As a result of 2 separate monitorings and34 responses to an LSC questionnaire that was mailed to all LSC programs,LSC estimates that at least 28,182 hours were spent handling legislativeredistricting cases. Specifically, the LSC study found that LSC recipients,in spite of one recipient's assertion that clients rarely come to the officecontending they have been ``malapportioned,'' had sought resources forspecialized computer equipment and a computer specialist to draw new electiondistrict boundaries to the recipients' satisfaction. In addition, recipientshired lobbyists to work on reapportionment issues, yet (in contraventionof section 1007(a)(5) of the LSC Act, 42 U.S.C. 2996f(a)(5)) had no documentedrequest from an eligible client or elected official to undertake this activity.Further, recipients also sought to orchestrate a State-wide effort of legalservices programs to ensure elections of specific persons, who would inturn be used as powerful allies in anticipated battles over funding forlegal services programs. The LSC study also revealed that certain LSC recipients requested and receivedFederal funds from the Corporation to establish a Voting Rights Projectcenter in connection with the 1980 census for the purpose of strengtheningMexican-American political power, yet had no request from an eligible clientto do so. These recipients prepared a voting rights litigation manual thatoutlined how to solicit clients for a redistricting battle and how to locatesuch a client. Since these redistricting activities were obviously conductedby legal services attorneys in pursuit of general policy goals (or evenin their own self-interest), rather than in the vindication of individualclients' rights, it is clear that involvement in redistricting activityis subject to abuse. Comments asserting that the reports of past abusehave been overstated were non-specific. Evidence of past abuse alreadybefore the Corporation, wherein legal services grantees have been linkedto redistricting activities designed to obtain favorable Congressionalsupport for the recipient's objectives, may legitimately be consideredby the Corporation in deciding how best to ration legal services resources.Finally, redistricting risks entanglement with political activities, <T3>see Gaffney </T3>v. <T3>Cummings, </T3>412 U.S. 735, 753 (1973) (``Politics and political considerationsare inseparable from redistricting and apportionment''), which should beavoided assiduously by LSC recipients. As noted in the discussion of theLSC study above, recipient involvement in redistricting too often was linkedto obtaining Congressional support for recipients' political or self-interestobjectives. The LSC Act declares that ``to preserve its strength, the legalservices program must be kept from the influence of or use by it of politicalpressures.'' 42 U.S.C. 2996. The LSC Act also specifically prohibits involvementin ``any political activity.'' 42 U.S.C. 2996f(a)(6)(A). In separate instances, LSC recipients were involved in reapportionmentcases with counsel for the Democratic and Republican parties. <T3>Upham </T3>v. <T3>Seamon, </T3>456 U.S. 37 (1982): <T3>Thornburg </T3>v. <T3>Gingles, </T3>478 U.S. 30 (1986). Comments from attorneys involvedin <T3>Gingles </T3>asserted that LSC recipient involvement was limited tofiling <T3>amicus </T3>briefs and that actions taken by the Republican Party lawyerswere totally separate and independent. While the Corporation makes no findingas to whether LSC recipients have aligned themselves with a particularpolitical party, it believes that any such activity risks an impermissiblepolitical alignment under the Act. Many of these same considerations warrant inclusion of ``the timing ormanner of taking of a census'' in the definition of redistricting. Commentschallenged the inclusion on the grounds that such activities are not intertwinedwith political activity, because the census is used for a wide varietyof purposes other than drawing election districts. The United States Constitutionmandates that a census be taken every ten years for purposes of reapportionment.U.S. Const. Art. 1, Sec. 2, Cl. 3. In essence, any participation by LSCrecipients to influence the timing or manner of taking a census would affectthe first step in the redistricting process. As such, involvement in census-takingproperly may be prohibited, as it is a necessary antecedent to redistricting.Additionally, ample alternative public and private entities are availableto pursue census cases. Overwhelmingly, the cases challenging the censushave been brought by State and local governments because they have a stronginterest in the outcome of the census. <T3>See generally, City of New York </T3>v. <T3>United States Dept. of Commerce, </T3>No. 88 CV 3474 (E.D.N.Y. 1989);<T3>Cuomo </T3>v.<T3> Baldrige, </T3>674 F.Supp. 1089 (S.D.N.Y. 1987); <T3>City of Willacoochee, Ga. </T3>v. <T3>Baldrige, </T3>556 F.Supp. 551 (S.D.Ga. 1983); <T3>Young </T3>v.<T3> Klutznick, </T3>497 F.Supp. 1318 (E.D. Mich. 1980), <T3>rev'd on other grounds, </T3>652 F.2d 617 (6th Cir. 1981), <T3>cert. denied, </T3>455 U.S. 939 (1982); <T3>Carey </T3>v. <T3>Klutznick, </T3>637 F.2d 834 (2d Cir. 1980); <T3>City of Philadelphia </T3>v. <T3>Klutznick, </T3>503 F.Supp. 663 (E.D. Pa. 1980). A review of this samplingof cases reveals the following named plaintiffs: States of New York andCalifornia; Cities of New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Philadelphiaand Detroit; Dade County, Florida; the United States Conference of Mayors;the National League of Cities; the League of United Latin American Citizens;the NAACP; and various mayors, governors and State and national legislators.This wide range of available representation would make any representationby LSC recipients unnecessary. Any undercount reduces the share of Federalrevenue to which states and localities may be entitled_particularly forassistance programs for the poor_thus affecting their interest in the qualityand quantity of social services they can offer their indigent citizensand their own financial status as governments. Local governments are alsoin a better financial position to make census challenges. Thus, any useof LSC funds for such purposes would clearly not be an economical or effectiveutilization of resource. <T3>See </T3>42 U.S.C. 2996f(a)(3). In summary, the Corporation has ample authority and policy grounds to prohibitredistricting activity by LSC recipients with LSC or private funds. <T3>Clarifying amendments. </T3>Several clarifying amendments were adoptedby the Board to delineate certain permissible activities that fall outsidethe scope of the rule's prohibition. Paragraph (a) of andSection; 1632.4provides that redistricting activity is the only type of Voting RightsAct litigation prohibited by this rule. Other suits brought under the act,such as the right to vote itself and physical access cases, are permitted.Paragraph (b) makes clear that the public and tribal funds are not governedby this part. Thus, the prohibition in this part shall not prevent theuse of public or tribal funds for redistricting as long as it is in accordwith the purposes for which the funds were provided.Paragraph (c) provides that employees of recipients may be involved inredistricting activities as long as their involvement does not make useof the program's resources or time, does not involve identification withthe program, and is outside the context of advice and representation. Thisprovision is intended to ensure that the prohibition in this part doesnot infringe upon the First Amendment rights of recipient employees. Finally, paragraph (d) provides that this part does not prohibit any activitiesotherwise permitted by 45 CFR Part 1604, LSC's regulation on the outsidepractice of law. Generally, Part 1604 prohibits outside practice of law,except that newly employed attorneys may close cases from previous lawpractices, and uncompensated representation pursuant to a court order,for a close friend or family member, or for a religious, community, orcharitable group may be permitted.\5\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ The breadth of the exception in section 1604.4 with regardto legal services program attorneys being compensated in connection withan ``outside'' law practice has been criticized as going beyond the termsof the section of the LSC Act on which it is based, 42 U.S.C. 2996f(a)(4).<T3>See Dubose </T3>v. <T3>Pierce, </T3>579 F.

L. 100-459, 102 Stat. 2226 (1988), the Corporation is requiredto give 15 days' notice to the appropriations committees of both Housesof Congress prior to promulgating new regulations. Notice letters dulywere sent to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations. No objectionwas voiced by the Senate committee. The Chairman of the House Subcommitteeon the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, andRelated Agencies responded on July 28, 1989, and his letter appears inAppendix A to this notice. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 45 CFR Part 1632 </ITAG>Legal services.For the reasons set out in the preamble, 45 CFR Chapter XVI is amendedby adding Part 1632 as follows: <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 1632_REDISTRICTING </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1632.1 Purpose. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1632.2 Definitions. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1632.3 Prohibition.   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1632.4 Permissible activity.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> 42 U.S.C. 2996e(b)(1)(A), 2996f(a)(2)(C), 2996f(a)(3),2996g(e). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1632.1 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Purpose. </ITAG>This part is intended to ensure that funds available to recipients willbe utilized to the maximum extent for the delivery of basic day-to-daylegal services to eligible poor individuals.
