The aim ofthe work was to quantify the effect of the intermittency and uncertaintyof wind power generation on the remainder of the generating plant andon the system operation as a whole, to identify whether wind plant couldmake a useful contribution to meeting electricity requirements in theUK. The model uses an hourly integration time step to model the operationof a number of different types of electricity generating plant includingwind turbines in servicing representative system load variations overperiods of usually one year. Novel computer routines have been developedto model the sequenced start-up, regulation and shut-down of fossil fuelsteam plant which is the main plant type within the Central ElectricityGenerating Board (CEGB) system.</TEXT></DOC>
