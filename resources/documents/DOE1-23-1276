The results showthat with an acceptable vacuum pumping capacity the required start vacuumconditions can be realized within reasonable time. The two blanket conceptsdo not differ remarkably in their evacuation behaviour. The remaininglarge pressure differences between the different locations of the vacuumchamber can be reduced if approximately 30% of the total gas flow isextracted from the heads of the blanket replacement ports.</TEXT></DOC>
