Boththe North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the individual nationsof northern Europe must carefully assess the implications of this factor.The Soviets possess the capability to project an unprecedented militarythreat in the region. The deployment of modern weapons systems-many thatare consistent with offensive action in a regional context-is part ofthe changing scene. Yet some analysts in northern Europe who have livednext to Soviet strategic nuclear forces for decades are not alarmed.A misleading trend has developed in their political-military writing.Soviet &quot;military power&quot; in northern Europe is sometimes referred to asif it had no regional significance. In this type of analysis, all Sovietmilitary power is treated in the same fashion as strategic nuclear systems.In Sweden, for example, it is not uncommon to find Soviet military powerreferred to as a &quot;factor in the great power competition,&quot; thus not ofdirect concern to Sweden. From a U.S. perspective, this type of reasoningis both anachronistic and incomplete. In this chapter, the changing natureof the Soviet military threat to Sweden will be discussed, as will someof Sweden's vulnerabilities and the Swedish debate over the implicationsof the growth of Soviet military power. Of particular interest to thosewho associate Sweden with pacifism is the internal debate over the degreeto which Sweden should turn to military force to compensate for the failureof diplomacy to enforce the credibility of Sweden's armed neutrality.An attempt has been made to show the issues from a Swedish rather thana NATO perspective.</TEXT></DOC>
