No one knows whether the apparent gaffe will be important for AIDS patients and for patenting of biotechnology products, or merely a tempest in a test-tube.    South San Francisco-based Genentech, which became the first of several contenders to begin testing its product on AIDS patients in August, has claimed the lead position in the hotly contested field. CD4 is a synthetic copy of the site on a human cell where the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome binds. Test-tube studies suggest that by flooding the body with copies of the site, the virus will bind with the decoys and the infection of human cells can be blocked.    But Genentech's protein -- like all proteins, made up of a chain of amino acids -- begins with the &quot;wrong&quot; amino acid, say the editors of the journal Biotechnology. Harvey Bialy, research editor, says Genentech substituted the amino acid asparagine for the proper ingredient, the amino acid lysine. His report is scheduled for publication this week.    Other companies in the race, SmithKline Beckman Corp. and Biogen Inc., detected the error and corrected the chemical structure of their products, says Mr. Bialy, who holds a doctoral degree in molecular biology. &quot;Genentech is the only one with the wrong (protein) now,&quot; he adds. SmithKline, based in Philadelphia, confirms that its product uses the lysine. Biogen, Cambridge, Mass., has declined to comment.    &quot;We've not stated publicly what the structure of our products are. And we don't intend to. It's proprietary,&quot; says Stephen Sherwin, Genentech's director of clinical research. &quot;The data speaks for itself,&quot; he adds. Since August, the drug has been given to about 20 AIDS patients, with no acute side effects observed so far.    The roots of the mistake weren't Genentech's. Rather, the error arose in an academic paper on CD4 by Richard Axel and his group at Columbia University. Scientists predicted that the particular amino acid would be asparagine, but were wrong -- a common occurrence when such findings first appear, Mr. Bialy says. But apparently Genentech adopted the protein structure with asparagine as scientific canon, and there the trouble began, he adds. The scientists are expected to publish the corrected structure soon.    Although no one knows what human tests ultimately will show, the amino acid substitution could cause the body to mount an immune reaction, making antibodies against synthetic CD4. (In an earlier and relatively benign instance of structural variation, Genentech's successful growth hormone product was manufactured with an extra methionine amino acid compound on its chain. The addition is thought to be potentially linked with mild allergic reactions.)    Moreover, while some proteins show variable amino acid structures in nature, CD4 is consistent. Lysine is found at this point in the chain not only in man, but also in mice, rats and sheep -- giving it a protected or &quot;highly conserved&quot; place in nature's recipe. Because CD4 appears to be constructed the same way across all these species, some scientists infer that this structure is essential to the workings of the protein.    &quot;We don't know why nature conserved it,&quot; says Martin Rosenberg, vice president of biopharmaceutical research at SmithKline. &quot;It could be that it is important to the activity, stability, or specificity of the molecule.&quot;    Dr. Sherwin, who holds a degree in medicine, counters that the various versions of alpha interferon protein now on the market incorporate differences in amino acid structure, with no apparent effect on patients. &quot;It's been a non-issue,&quot; he says of amino acid variation. SmithKline's Mr. Rosenberg, a molecular biologist, rejects that idea.    &quot;That's like saying that all trees are green. And my bicycle is green. Therefore, my bicycle is a tree,&quot; he says. &quot;These are two different products.&quot;    Dr. Sherwin says that CD4 also holds promise as a carrier for toxins that could kill the AIDS virus, or for particles that could enhance immunity such as the immunoglobulin molecule, an all-purpose antibody. &quot;CD4 itself may be just the tip of the iceberg,&quot; he said.    What possible effect the variant CD4 could have on Genentech's competitive position, or patent position, is impossible to predict. Mark Ratner, Biotechnology's senior editor for financial coverage, speculates, &quot;It's something that's amendable without prejudice.&quot; Besides, he adds, &quot;The 'wrong' molecule could work as well as the 'right' molecule. Until it goes through trials, no one knows.&quot;    Clinical tests of Genentech's CD4 in AIDS patients, while still at an early stage, have run smoothly, reports one researcher. &quot;We haven't identified a clinical problem with this product so far,&quot; says Samuel Broder, director of clinical oncology at the National Cancer Institute. &quot;If we do, I'm confident that (the scientists at Genentech) can fix it.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
