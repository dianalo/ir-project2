The textile accord, which took effect last Friday, allows Mexico to increase its textile and apparel exports to the U.S. by 6% a year, the highest rate that the U.S. has given any foreign supplier during its current round of renegotiations of textile agreements.    In return, Mexico gave the U.S. the right to ship $240 million in apparel and other finished textile products a year and agreed to substantially lower barriers against imports of U.S.-made yarns and fabrics.    Until last year, Mexico effectively barred the entry of most U.S. textiles or garments, except for one category, through an import-licensing system that discouraged U.S. exporters from even trying to crack the Mexican market. The exception involved the export of U.S. fabrics for cutting and assembly in Mexico and re-export to the U.S. in the form of finished apparel.    &quot;This is the first time that any of our bilateral trading partners has opened up a textile quota for the U.S.,&quot; a U.S. trade official said. The Mexican concessions were part of an overall agreement affecting such U.S. commodities or services as steel, farm products and intellectual property rights.    The American Textile Manufacturers Institute, the U.S. industry's Washington-based lobby, wasn't pleased by the accord. &quot;It's far too generous to a country that has doubled its shipments to the U.S. in the last two years and is now our sixth-largest supplier,&quot; said the institute's president, Robert Laidlaw.    U.S. trade officials insist, though, that the new accord places tighter curbs on the growth of Mexican shipments. Last year, Mexico was able to sharply expand its exports to the U.S. because the old agreement left many products outside the quota structure.    Mexican textile and apparel exports to the U.S. totaled $475 million in 1986, and the volume of exports during the first 10 months of last year rose 48% from the year-earlier period, U.S. officials said.    The officials said the new accord can better prevent import surges because it covers as much as 80% of all textile categories.    It remains to be seen, however, how much the U.S. will benefit from the Mexican concessions. The U.S. industry claims that the conditions Mexico has attached to the use of the quota -- including a requirement that the goods should be priced within the reach of the average Mexican consumers -- could defeat its purpose.    &quot;At the rate they're loading the agreement with caveats, we'll never see the $240 million in benefits,&quot; a textile institute analyst said.    U.S. trade officials didn't confirm the existence of such conditions. However, they said the U.S. has the right to seek redress if the U.S. benefits don't materialize. </TEXT></DOC>
