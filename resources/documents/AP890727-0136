KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A threat to cancel the F-14D jet fighter andV-22 Osprey tilt-rotor plane disappeared today as a key Houseopponent bowed to strong political support and withdrew a proposalto scuttle the military aircraft programs.   Rep. William Dickinson of Alabama, ranking Republican on theHouse Armed Services Committee, pulled a proposed amendment to adefense authorization bill that would have eliminated the F-14D.   The fighter, nicknamed the Tomcat, is strongly backed bylawmakers from New York, where it is manufactured by GrummanAerospace Corp.   New York Reps. Norman Lent, Raymond McGrath and David Martinsucceeded in persuading Dickinson to withdraw the provision,according to New York Democrat George Hochbrueckner, a formerGrumman engineer.   ``It's clear we had the votes but we didn't want to test that,''Hochbrueckner said. ``Let the amendment die.''   Dickinson also decided not to introduce an amendment cancelingthe Marine Corps Osprey, a transport aircraft that takes off like ahelicopter but can fly like a plane. It has the support of membersfrom Pennsylvania and Texas, where the V-22 is built, as well asformer Marines in Congress.   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has sought to scrap both aircraftprojects as a money-saving step.   But the House Armed Services Committee voted last month torestore $157 million for the Osprey in fiscal 1990 and about $230million for the Tomcat.   Earlier today, the House voted to urge President Bush to opennegotiations with the Soviet Union aimed at banning the productionof plutonium and enriched uranium, the materials used in nuclearweapons.   The vote for the non-binding resolution, attached to the defenseauthorization bill, was 284-138.   Supporters of the amendment said such negotiations are a logicaland needed next step in the arms control process.   But opponents said such a ban would be impossible to verify andwould put the United States at a serious disadvantage because ithas no currently operating nuclear enrichment production plantswhile the Soviet Union has 12 to 14 ``going at full blast.''   Rep. Dante Fascell, D-Fla., chairman of the House ForeignAffairs Committee, said the talks could resolve an ``tremendousimbalance'' in which the Soviets are adding to their nuclearstockpile while U.S. production stands at ``zero.''   ``This is an effort to get us on the negotiating track and dealwith this problem if possible,'' he said. ``This is an expressionof Congress saying, `Mr President, see what you can do.'''   Rep. Bob Walker, R-Pa., replied that the Bush administrationopposes the measure and that U.S. arms negotiators are against itbecause an agreement could not be verified.   ``Let's not do something stupid,'' Walker said.   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed ServicesCommittee, said he worried that Congress might, with suchsuggestions, ``overload the arms control agenda.''   The House voted Wednesday to curb production of theradar-evading stealth bomber program, but Cheney expressed reliefthe chamber had not killed the $70 billion program outright.   Cheney said the White House hopes a House conference with theSenate to resolve differences in the two chambers' versions of the$295 billion defense authorization bill will remove the roadblocksand permit a fast start for production of the costly bomber.   ``They (the administration) have, in effect, a year torestructure the program, to prove through tests it's worthbuying,'' Aspin told reporters. ``It's the core of the argument. Wedon't know enough right now to make a decision.''   The Aspin amendment would require the Pentagon to meet rigidtest and performance standards before additional stealth bombersare purchased. It would limit to two the number of bombers to bepurchased over the next two fiscal years.   The administration suffered an unwanted budget cut Wednesdaywhen the House approved an amendment to reduce by $502 million the$1.1 billion earmarked for spare MX missiles and for a rail systemBush requested to make the MX a mobile system. The 224-197 votedoes not affect the nearly $800 million earmarked for the missilesthemselves.   The Senate, voting 98-1 on Tuesday, endorsed President Bush'stwo-year request for $4.7 billion for stealth production,conditioned on the aircraft meeting flight-test and radar-evasionstandards.   Before adopting the Aspin amendment the House defeated aproposal to eliminate the program outright.</TEXT></DOC>
