Evans, who was 87, died Sunday at a nursing home in Brighton,said George Schaefer, Dean of Theater, Film and TV at University ofCalifornia, Los Angeles.   ``He had been ill. He had a heart attack a few years back, andbronchial problems, and I guess it just all caught up with him,''said Schaefer.   His American career also included motion pictures, including suchfilms as ``Rosemary's Baby'' and ``The Planet of the Apes,'' inwhich he appeared in full-face simian makeup.   The actor also was a familiar face to television viewers,starring in TV versions of his Shakespearean plays on ``The HallmarkHall of Fame'' and in such lighter fare as ``Batman,'' ``Tarzan,''``Bewitched'' and ``Daniel Boone'' in the 1960s.   Schaefer, who met Evans during World War II, said the actor wasmostly retired during the past 10 years except for occasional stageroles and bit parts in films.   ``He was one of the last great actor-managers,'' said Schaefer,speaking of the period when Evans produced such Broadway hits as``Teahouse of the August Moon,'' ``Dial M for Murder,'' and ``NoTime for Sergeants.''   Schaefer, a former producer for the ``Hallmark Hall of Fame,''credited Evans with the idea of bringing quality television toAmerican audiences.   He produced ``Maurice Evans Presents Hallmark Hall of Fame'' fromOctober 1955 to March 1956, offering ``Alice in Wonderland,'' ``TheCorn is Green'' and ``The Taming of the Shrew,'' and won a bestprogram Emmy in 1961 for ``Macbeth.''   Evans was born in Dorchester, Dorset, England. His father,Herbert, was a Welsh druggist and justice of the peace who was alsoan amateur actor and placed his son in adaptations of Thomas Hardynovels at age seven.   Joining the London stage, Evans became one of the city's mostsought-after ctors after his 1929 performance in ``Journey's End.''   At the same time, the financially pragmatic actor ran adry-cleaning firm during the day.   ``I have no intentions of winding up starving in an attic,'' heonce vowed.   He later joined the Old Vic Theatre and portrayed such classicalShakespearean roles as Hamlet, Richard II and Caesar.   With his smooth, baritone voice, he was lured to Broadway in 1935for ``Romeo and Juliet,'' and reprised his ``Hamlet'' role in afive-hour Broadway play in 1938.   Evans became an American citizen in 1941 and entered the U.S.Army in 1942, where he staged about sixty plays for troops,including a popular shortened version of ``Hamlet'' which becameknown as ``G.I. Hamlet.''   He returned to Broadway after the war, becoming a criticalsuccess and a millionaire.   ``The Teahouse of the August Moon'' earned him a Tony Award asproducer in 1954, and he won an honorary Tony in 1950.   There are no immediate survivors, Schaefer said.</TEXT></DOC>
