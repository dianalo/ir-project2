Estimating the expectedperformance of concentrator cells under nonuniform illumination is achallenge that goes beyond simply aggregating the measured performanceof cells exposed to a range of uniform illumination conditions. It requiresthe ability to simulate the nonuniform illumination profile of the moduleoptics and to understand the impact that nonuniform illumination hason the cell's power conversion mechanisms. This paper presents theseenhancements to an existing PV concentrator performance model that simulatesthe performance of front-gridded cells with parallel grid lines operatingunder expected illumination conditions. The model uses standard testdata for a user-selected reference cell to estimate the performance ofsimilar cells with different area, metallization coverage, and illuminationprofile. It also accommodates the application of a prismatic opticalcover to eliminate grid-line obscuration. 5 refs., 8 figs., 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
