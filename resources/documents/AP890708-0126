Masters Bruce Devereux and Howard Wilson, and their crews, weretaken to a ferry that left here late Friday, Mike Harpold of the INSsaid. Their fishing boats remained docked in Ketchikan.   The Coast Guard on Wednesday seized the 50-foot Viscount and the40-foot Fonzie after it said the vessels were observed fishing inU.S. waters of Dixon Entrance, between Southeast Alaska and Canada'sQueen Charlotte Islands.   Wilson, master of the Fonzie, said he has fished for 10 years inthe area where the boat was seized. ``I do not believe I was overthe line,'' said Wilson of Parksville, British Columbia.   He said idling his boat was costly. ``We're losing about $3,000 aday to sit here,'' Wilson said.   Earlier, Devereux told Canadian Press he was roughed up bymembers of the Coast Guard party that boarded his boat. Coast Guardspokesman Ed Moreth said the Canadians filed no complaints abouttheir treatment.   A federal court complaint alleging illegal fishing and seekingforfeiture of the vessels, gear and fish on board was filed Fridayin Anchorage. Canada filed with the State Department a protestseeking release of the vessels.   The 4,000 pounds of salmon aboard each boat were sold to aKetchikan cannery, with the payment to be held in court until thematter is resolved.</TEXT></DOC>
