Based on the first-quantized Fock spaceof the nonlinear {sigma} model with a Wess-Zumino term, we constructa superstring field theory by means of the conformal field theory. Thereparametrization invariance and Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin symmetry areproved and the critical dimension of Minkowski space turns out to bed = 10-(2/3kd/sub G//(k +C/sub A//2)-1)/3d/sub G/.</TEXT></DOC>
