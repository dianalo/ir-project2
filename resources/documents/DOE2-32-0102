It is assumed that the magneticfield reduces the efficiency of convection inside the spot. A uniquerelation between the stellar mass and the difference of effective temperaturesof the spot and the surrounding photosphere is adopted from observations.It is equivalent to the reduction of a/sub s/ (the mixing length theoryparameter) inside the spot to the value 0.15 independently of the stellarmass. The surface magnetic field of large spots covering a considerablepart of the stellar surface is a decreasing function of the magneticflux. Hence a coverage of a star by magnetic regions rapidly increasesas a function of the magnetic flux in a narrow range of fluxes. Thisbehaviour can explain the Vaughan-Preston gap. Recent observations ofmagnetic fields on G and K type stars are in a good agreement with ourpredictions. 35 refs., 3 figs., 4 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
