The overall consumption constants of DMVC with time were determined,as well as consumption constants of DMVC k/sub 1q/, taking into accountthe absorption of the reagent on the catalysts. It was shown that thedehydration reaction is irreversible, is first order with respect toDMVC, and the equation log k/sub 1q/ + H{sub 0} = const, where H{sub0} is the acidity function holds.</TEXT></DOC>
