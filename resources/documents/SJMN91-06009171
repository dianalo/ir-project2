Increasingly, Californiachildren come to school with limited English proficiency (LEP). Highestconcentrations are in urban areas.  </CAPTION><DESCRIPT>  STATE; SCHOOL; POPULATION; STATISTIC; REPORT  </DESCRIPT><LEADPARA>  Long gone are the days when the typical California student was a white,English-speaking child from a middle-class family.;    And no longer can thestate's schools continue operating under the old assumptions, a reportreleased Tuesday by a statewide organization of principals and superintendentsasserts. Now is the time, it says, to transform education to meet the needs ofstudents already in their classrooms.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  California News  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  SCHOOL REPORT: DRAMATIC CHANGES NEEDED  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     The report calls for dramatic changes in education, ranging  from smallerclasses and flexible school schedules to more training for school personnel indealing with people from different cultures and the development of technologyto translate educational materials into many languages.;    The findings andthe recommendations are not new. What sets them apart from the plethora ofsimilar reports from researchers and advocates is that they come from theheart of the educational establishment, the Association of California SchoolAdministrators, which represents 15,000 school principals, administrators andsuperintendents in 1,010 school districts.;    The report grew out of &quot;thefrustrations that principals were feeling in trying to deal with dramaticallydifferent students that they had never faced before,&quot; said David Brown, ACSApresident and superintendent of the Irvine Unified School District.;   Already, more than half of the state's kindergarten-through-12th gradestudents are from ethnic minority groups. One in six was born in anothercountry. One in five lives in poverty. One in four doesn't speak English athome. And one in three drops out of high school before graduation.;    Thechanges are happening so fast that demographers predict that 70 percent ofCalifornia's students will be ethnic minorities by 2005.;    Brown said thereport, heavy on statistics, was designed to grab the attention of theparents, business leaders and government officials whose help is vital totransforming schools into places where a child's cultural background is not areason for failure.;    Although there is likely to be little money for therecommendations in the governor's budget scheduled to be released Thursday,Brown argued that it's time for the state to recognize the magnitude of theproblems schools face.;    Laurie Olsen of California Tomorrow was encouragedby the administrator's support for reforms along the lines of those proposedby her organization, which works as an advocate group for immigrants.;   &quot;It's hopeful that as powerful a group as ACSA is calling for very similarthings to what advocates and researchers have been coming to for the last fiveto six years,&quot; Olsen said. &quot;That's a very hopeful thing. The difficult thingis implementation.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  ALETA WATSON, Mercury News Education Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910109  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  4B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  DIAGRAM  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  442  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday, January 9, 199100009171,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
