Following the Boeing announcement, which was made after stock exchanges closed, analysts said the delays would have an impact on Boeing's earnings in this year's fourth quarter and 1989's first period.    The 747-400, an advanced version of the world's largest commercial aircraft, sells for about $125 million. Because Boeing recognizes revenue from the sale of aircraft at the time of delivery, the two-aircraft delay this year probably will reduce 1988 revenue about $250 million, said Howard A. Rubel, an aerospace analyst with C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc.    Mr. Rubel added that he had been expecting Boeing to deliver about 14 of the four-engine jetliners, valued at about $1.75 billion, during the first quarter of 1989. A Boeing spokesman declined to comment. In a prepared statement, the company said there will be &quot;a substantial reduction in first-quarter 1989 deliveries, with the offsetting increase in deliveries largely occurring in the second quarter of 1989.&quot;    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Boeing common closed at $66 a share, off 12.5 cents.    The prepared statement attributed the delays to an increase in the 747 production rate to five aircraft a month from two, differences between details of customer orders for each aircraft and the demands of certifying the three different engines available for the model. The statement said Boeing intended to return to its original schedule by mid-1989.    &quot;There has been an impact on the entire production line. We've had a number of problems, but we're not going to go into the details of the specific problems,&quot; the Boeing spokesman said.    In April, the maiden flight of the 747-400 was delayed by electrical problems related to the installation of new digital technology in the aircraft. At the time, Boeing said two aircraft, ordered by Northwest Airlines and Singapore Airlines for delivery this year, might not make their schedules, but Boeing declined to say how that might affect its $17 billion revenue estimate for 1988. The aircraft made its first flight in May, and certification by the Federal Aviation Administration still is expected in December.    The delivery delays are an unexpected blow to Boeing, which has had a record year of aircraft sales, booking a total of $22.8 billion in firm orders that have helped boost its share price from $38 since Jan.1.    Analysts boosted their earnings estimates for 1988 after the company reported that second-quarter net income surged 37% to $160 million, or $1.05 a share, on sales of $4.7 billion.    Yesterday, Mr. Rubel said he reduced only slightly his full-year net income estimate, to $4 a share from $4.10 a share. &quot;I have great confidence in the company's technical skills, and 1989 probably will turn out to be a very good year,&quot; he said.    Separately, Boeing said it would decrease its use of formaldehyde at an Auburn, Wash., aircraft plant where production-line employees have complained of toxic poisoning.    Boeing is investigating the matter and has set up a medical review board to deal with the workmen's compensation claims of some of the workers, who say they have become sick from handling and breathing materials containing the hazardous chemical.    About 60% of the formaldehyde-containing material, used in making strong, lightweight &quot;composite&quot; jetliner parts at the plant, will be replaced by a glassfiber and polyester material. The change doesn't affect any of Boeing's other commercial or military aircraft-manufacturing facilities, the company said. </TEXT></DOC>
