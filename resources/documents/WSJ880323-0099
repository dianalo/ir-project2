The devices' refined sound quality -- weeding out unnecessary noises so that voices can be heard more clearly -- means that hearing can be effectively restored for an increasing number of the 20 million hearing-impaired people in the U.S. Digital systems are expected to account for much of the improvement, although advances also are being made in conventional analog hearing aids.    &quot;There's still room to grow in traditional hearing aids, but digital is definitely the next frontier,&quot; says Michael Seidemann, director of audiology at the Eye, Ear, Nose and Throat Hospital in New Orleans.    This month, for instance, Nicolet Instrument Corp. of Madison, Wis., is launching the first fully computerized hearing aid. The $1,800 digital device uses an earpiece to pick up sound that is then sent to a 2-inch-by-4-inch, pocket-held computer, where it is converted to digital code. The computer processes the code, eliminating unnecessary sounds and adjusting it to the proper volume for the user. It then reconverts the code to sound, which is played back through the earpiece.    Some bugs still have to be worked out, though. The pocket computer, wired to the earpiece, makes it bulkier than other recent hearing aids. And because of processing delays, there is a slight but noticeable lag before the voice is heard -- comparable to an out-of-sync movie, audiologists say.    Conventional hearing aids also have achieved breakthroughs -- in miniaturization as well as in technology, such as distinguishing between speech and unwanted noise, says Richard Brander of Beltone Electronics Corp., one of the biggest makers of hearing aids. That distinction is the most significant advance in hearing-aid electronics in recent years, says Larry Dalzell, director of audiology at the University of Rochester Medical School. Most people with hearing loss can't use hearing aids in crowded areas such as restaurants or with the TV on because the devices amplify all sounds.    The main advance enabling analog devices to distinguish unwanted noise from speech has been a tiny computer -- the zeta noise blocker -- that was introduced last year. The computer, developed by Daniel Graupe, a professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago, can recognize speech amid other sounds and uses a series of filters to reduce background noise. When the device detects noise -- usually an uninterrupted band of sound, as opposed to the rapidly changing frequency of speech -- it analyzes the level and activates specific filters to remove the noise. The computer is licensed and marketed by Intellitech Inc. of Northbrook, Ill., and now is part of many major analog hearing aids.    Hearing aids can't solve all hearing problems, however. For middle ear and canal problems that haven't been adequately corrected by hearing aids or previous surgery, a new electromagnetic implant helps replace the ear's sound-detection mechanism, says William Gatti, director of otology at Loyola University Medical Center in Chicago.    In September, Xomed Inc., a unit of Bristol-Myers Co., introduced the surgical implant, which sends sound directly to the nerve cells in the inner ear, bypassing the middle ear. The device consists of a sound processor, which is worn behind the ear, and a disk implanted in the mastoid bone behind the ear.    Sound waves are first received by the processor, which transmits the vibrations through the disk directly to the temporal bone that encloses and contains the inner ear. The vibrations then cause the inner ear to stimulate the auditory nerve, enabling a person to hear.    The implant is only for cases of severe hearing loss, says Patrick Cusick, Xomed's president. And for the implant to be effective, the user must have healthy nerve functions in at least one ear.    For those who've had a sudden loss of hearing, some companies are experimenting with inner ear, or cochlear, implants. Instead of relying on the parts of the ear to convey sound signals to the auditory nerve cells, cochlear implants directly stimulate the nerve cells leading to the brain.    Cochlear implants, costing between $15,000 and $20,000, still require extensive development before they can be used widely, specialists say. Although the procedure may not restore hearing entirely, even partial improvement would be a major step in such cases. </TEXT></DOC>
