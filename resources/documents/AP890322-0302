Responding to criticism of Fed policy from members of a HouseBanking subcommittee, Greenspan said, ``There's certainly noquestion that the higher interest rates are, the more difficult itis for the thrifts.''   But, he said, if the Fed had not moved to dampen inflationarypressures by driving up rates, rates would have increased even moreon their own as investors sought returns compensating them forhigher inflation.   ``It's our view that the actions we have taken to date probablyhave made interest rates, certainly in the long end of the market,significantly lower than they would have otherwise been,'' Greenspansaid.   He also said that economic conditions today cannot be compared tothose that led to double-digit inflation and interest rates topping20 percent in the early 1980s. He said recent economic reportsindicating a pickup in inflation are partly a reflection ofpressures that have been evolving all along.   Greenspan testified a day after regulators reported that the Sandamp;Lindustry, after enduring a record loss in 1988, was threatened byrising interest rates.   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board said Tuesday that the nation's2,949 Sandamp;Ls lost $2.3 billion in the fourth quarter, pushing red inkfor the year to $12.1 billion, well past the previous record of $7.8billion set in 1987.   Much of last year's red ink, $11 billion, was old in the sensethat institutions finally got around to recognizing bad loans thathad long ago gone sour.   James Barth, chief economist of the bank board, and a number ofprivate analysts believe these non-operating losses, and thusoverall losses, will decline this year to lower, butstill-troublesome, levels.   However, they warn that rising interest rates, which increased 3percentage points over the past year and continue to climb, will eataway at the industry's slim operating profit, $900 million last year.   ``Operating income should be lower across the board for allthrifts in the first and second quarters,'' Barth said.   Savings and loans make their money by borrowing short-term, fromdepositors, and lending long-term, for mortgages and other purposes.When long rates are higher than short rates, the normal pattern,institutions earn more on loans than they pay to depositors. Butcurrently short-term rates approach and in some cases surpasslong-term rates, severely cutting into earnings.   Robert Litan, a banking expert at the Brookings Institution, aWashington-based, liberal-oriented research organization, said he isworried that higher rates will begin to erode the half of theindustry that is somewhere between healthy and insolvent or nearlyinsolvent.   According to the bank board, 1,226 institutions, representing 21percent of the industry's assets, have capital levels exceeding 6percent. Litan said most of these healthy institutions will earnless, but will still weather 1989 in fine shape.   There are 364 institutions, with 8 percent of the industry'sassets, that have failed and are waiting to be closed or sold by thegovernment. Another 390 Sandamp;Ls, with 23 percent of the assets, aresolvent but don't meet the current 3 percent capital standard. Litansays they are, in effect, already dead.   That leaves 969 Sandamp;Ls, with 47 percent of the assets, strugglingto bring their capital up to the tougher 6 percent standard thatwould be required by June 1991 under the Sandamp;L plan proposed byPresident Bush.   ``The real issue for the future is what happens to thethree-to-sixes. ... I worry about this category. They're notimmediately threatened, but what they do in the next three to fouryears is crucial. These guys are going to be under a lot of pressureto take risks,'' he said.   Bert Ely, an Alexandria, Va., financial institutions analyst,said this year's improved performance will be attributable to asignificant degree to $5 billion to $6 billion in governmentassistance flowing into the Sandamp;Ls rescued last year, in the busiestyear for regulators since the Depression.   ``It's just like the farm economy; if we have better results in1989, it's only because a substantial subsidy is being pumped intothe industry,'' he said.   Meanwhile, the bank board's Barth said the heaviest lossescontinued to be concentrated in just a few institutions, with the 20most-troubled institutions losing $2 billion in the fourth quarter.   Nine of the worst 20 were in Texas, and the state's 204institutions collectively lost $1.4 billion in the fourth quarterand $10.1 billion in all of 1988.   For the year, the 30 percent of the industry that wasunprofitable lost $17.7 billion, more than swamping the $5.6 billionearned by solvent institutions.</TEXT></DOC>
