A multimedia, systems approach to environmental monitoring isemphasized. The primary purpose of the research is to apply and fieldtest a technical report entitled ``Guidelines for measuring the physical,chemical, and biological condition of wilderness ecosystems.'' This documentintended to provide Federal Land Managers with information to establishenvironmental monitoring programs in wilderness areas. To date, thismonitoring document has yet to be evaluated under rigorous field conditionsat a remote, high-elevation Rocky Mountain site. For the purpose of fieldtesting approaches to monitoring of pollutants and ecosystems in remote,wilderness areas, evaluation criteria were developed. These include useability,cost-effectiveness, data variability, alternative approaches, ecosystemsconceptual approach, and quality assurance. Both the Forest Service andINEL environmental monitoring techniques will be evaluated with thesecriteria. Another objective of this research plan is to obtain an integrateddata base on pollutants and ecosystem structure and function at a remotestudy site. The methods tested in this project will be used to acquirethese data from a systems approach. This includes multimedia monitoringof air and water quality, soils, and forest, stream, and lake ecosystems.71 refs., 1 fig., 9 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
