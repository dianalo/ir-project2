WILSON</HEAD><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Desperate pleas of a family trying to locate arunaway child, shocking closeups of a drug addict shooting up withheroin, explicit re-creations of a brutal murder.   It is called ``televisione-verita,'' or truth TV, and ischallenging the fluffy variety show in the ratings on Italy'spublic and private television networks.   The trend, media experts say, reflects Italians' love ofintrigue and their increasing openness to discuss their privatelives and problems with others.   ``These programs are coherent with the Italian tradition of avery gossipy society,'' said Franco Ferrarottia, a sociologist atthe University of Rome.   They also have signaled a new relationship between statetelevision and the Italian public, which is generally alienatedfrom government institutions and bureaucracy.   ``Until recently TV was a major pillar of the establishment,''Ferrarotti said in an interview. ``These programs would have beenconsidered scandalous, even blasphemous. The official TV is finallymoving into the sphere of private Italian life.''   The explosion of truth TV has improved ratings but also raisedethical questions about invasion of privacy and use of dramaticreconstructions and anonymous calls.   Oreste Del Buono, a TV columnist for the newspaper CorriereDella Sera, has been a leading critic of the shows, saying networksare taking too many risks with live broadcasts, anonymous callersand crime shows that focus on ``poor people, without laywers,treated like animals.''   The shows are also a product of the intense competition betweenthe state-run RAI network and the three major private stations ofSilvio Berlusconi. Most of the truth TV programs are on RAI, whichexploits its monopoly on live broadcasting.   Truth TV relies heavily on phone calls from the public, addingto the drama and immediacy of the broadcast but also creatingpotential risks.   On one recent weekday afternoon, actress Sandra Milo was host ona new live talk show, ``L'Amore e Una Cosa Meravigliosa'' (``LoveIs a Wonderful Thing''), on RAI when a woman called in and said,``Sandra, what are you doing there while your son is seriouslyinjured in the hospital?''   To the horror of a nationwide audience of some 3 million people,Milo burst into sobs, ran off the set and fainted in her dressingroom. The call turned out to be a hoax as her son, Ciro, wastracked down at the home of friends.   RAI said it would tighten controls on phone calls to live shows,but some commentators said viewers would no longer trust anonymouscallers.   ``This incident signals a critical moment in the history oftruth television,'' wrote best-selling novelist Umberto Eco in acolumn in L'Espresso magazine. ``It's certain that from this momentthe public will become more suspicious and many programs willsuffer from a crisis of credibility.''   That hasn't seemed to be the case so far with the most popularof the new genre, ``Chi L'Ha Visto?'', a show on missing peoplethat attracts more than 5 million viewers on Sunday nights.   The live, three-hour RAI program uses elaborate re-creationstracing missing persons' lives and last known movements, compositephotos showing how their appearances could have changed, interviewswith their families and calls from viewers around the country whomay have spotted them.   The inaugural show last year caused a stir when it examined thedisappearance of a U.S. woman sailor from a military base inNaples. It included a re-creation suggesting the woman had beenmurdered after a sexual tryst with two fellow American malesailors. But hours after the show aired, the woman was found aliveand well in southern Italy by a police officer who had watched theprogram. She had run off with a Moroccan immigrant.   Calls from viewers on ``Chi L'Ha Visto?'' have helped reuniteseveral families, but often the missing person has run away on hisor her own and has no intention of going home. On a recent show, awife became visibly annoyed as callers repeatedly reported havingseen her missing husband traveling with a young woman _ one said hesaw the couple dancing the tango in a nightclub near Naples.   ``It couldn't be him, he doesn't like the tango,'' the wife shotback.   Lio Beghin, who conceived the show, said in an interview with IlMessaggero newspaper: ``We are well aware that the biggest dangeris invading the private life of a person and getting into themerits of making a free choice to leave one's past behind. Butpeople also have the right to know the fate of a missing relative.''   Another popular but controversial live RAI program is ``TelefonoGiallo,'' which literally translates as ``Yellow Telephone'' but isa play on the word ``giallo,'' which also means ``mystery.'' Theshow examines unsolved crimes, hoping that anonymous calls willhelp provide clues that can reopen the case.   ``This show could probably go on for another 1,000 years,''Ferrarotti joked. ``So many Italian crimes are unsolved.''   Crime is also the main event in programs such as ``ProntoPolizia,'' a show on the private Italia Uno channel that followspolice on emergency calls _ from raids on drug dens to breakups ofstreet fights.   Last year, guests on ``Io Confesso'' (``I Confess'') would sitin a booth, their faces concealed, and recount their crimes oraberrant behavior and answer questions from psychologists. On ``LaMacchina Della Verita'' (``The Truth Machine''), they submitted tolie-detector tests.   The Italian public sometimes complains that TV goes too far.Many Italians were shocked when one of Berlusconi's stations showeda young addict injecting himself with heroin on camera. Manyprotested when RAI subjected 8-year-old Marco Fiora to prolongedquestioning on a live, nationwide interview show only a short timeafter the boy's release from a 17-month kidnapping ordeal.   ``For years we justly lamented that TV put people to sleep, thatit was a social pacifier,'' Corrado Augias, host of ``TelefonoGiallo,'' told Europeo magazine. ``And now that TV tackles problemsand crime news, it almost seems that some want to go back to thatunglorious past.''   But overall, Italians' love affair with TV is stronger thanever. What other country has 10 national TV magazines on the market?   Pay-TV could be the next wave. Italy's first pay station,Italian Network, is scheduled to debut Feb. 28. For the cost of a$200 descrambler, viewers will be able to watch pornographic moviesafter midnight.   Tens of thousands of people already have signed up, but othershave threatened to file obscenity charges to keep the station offthe air.
