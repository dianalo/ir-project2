Encased in a brightly lit glass box in a dark granitemausoleum on Red Square, Vladimir Ilyich Lenin smiles ever soslightly, eternally oblivious to the fate of the party hecreated. In repose, his hands are lying peacefully. His darksuit is neatly pressed. His hair and goatee are perfectlycombed. Outside, two tall KGB sentries in blue-and-gold dressuniforms stand silently at the door.</LP><TEXT>   Lenin has been dead for almost 68 years. His country is inupheaval. Still, hundreds of Soviets line up to file quietlypast his body. They talk in hushed voices, under the sterneyes of elite KGB guards. While many Soviets now debatewhether Lenin was right or wrong, whether his body shouldstay or go, whether it's really his body, and about who orwhat will rise to take his place, many of the visitors arereluctant to give up a hero.   &quot;For me, he's a holy person,&quot; says Larissa Sologubova, a29-year-old railway worker from Bryansk. &quot;I teach my childrento feel Lenin was like a god.&quot;   Mrs. Sologubova, a muscular woman dressed in her Sundaybest, is making her annual pilgrimage to the mausoleum. Thisyear she is celebrating the decision of Soviet PresidentMikhail Gorbachev to dissolve the party; Lenin will now bereborn, she explains. She hopes this time around for a purermanifestation of his vision, saying the party had recently&quot;lost its meaning&quot; in its struggle for power. Like Lenin, shedreams, she says, of a world where &quot;I don't have to fight forevery kopek to provide food for my children.&quot;   In a land of fallen icons, from the czars to FelixDzerzhinsky, the founder of the KGB, Lenin may be all theSoviets have left. A Marx-inspired visionary, his 1902pamphlet, &quot;What Is to Be Done?&quot; became the Soviet equivalentof the Federalist Papers. One of the great moments of therevolution was Lenin's return from exile in 1917 to lead theBolshevik cause. The armored car in which he traveled isenshrined in a Leningrad museum. He triumphed in the civilwar that followed the overthrow of Czar Nicholas. He ruledthe Soviet Union until his death in 1924.   But he is equally known for his ruthless use of militaryforce and terror. Under his rule, the czar and his familywere brutally murdered, and the KGB's predecessor agency wasborn. Soviet-style dictatorship and state-sponsored terrorismbecame twin scourges of the 20th century.   Victor Bachtinov, 41, a machinist from Siberia on holidayin Moscow, has come with his wife, son and daughter. Theyhave never before visited the mausoleum and fear that Leninmay not be around much longer -- though no one of anyauthority has called for removal of the body. Voters inLeningrad recently did vote to restore the name of St.Petersburg.   Mr. Bachtinov says the party should be disbanded becauseLenin's ideas have been twisted over the years bypower-hungry party leaders who have served only themselvesand not the people. &quot;Lenin's idea was for people to behonest. If we were all honest, life would be wonderful,&quot; Mr.Bachtinov says.   The solemnity of Lenin's visitors and clicks fromtourists' cameras are suddenly broken. A band of protestersmarch into Red Square screaming into megaphones. Some havebeen drinking. One yells that the tanks that invaded Moscowlast week have turned around and are coming back. &quot;The coupisn't over,&quot; he shouts.   &quot;Lenin is the main criminal,&quot; says Sergei Bondura, 32, anunemployed Ukrainian who joins the protesters. &quot;He stood outin front of the party mafia. He created it.&quot;   Sergei Lavrinovich, 51, an engineer, is taking pictures ofthe Russian republic flag that now flies alongside the hammerand sickle at the Kremlin. He takes a calmer but similarlycritical view. &quot;The whole mistake was that we were brought upwith the word `equality,'&quot; he says. &quot;The main idea ofequality should be of opportunity. People are not createdequal. Some people can run faster than others.&quot;   Controversy over Lenin isn't new. After decades ofidolatry, the Soviets began a few years ago to take a morecritical look at the father of the revolution. During thelast several years of perestroika, as people have become moredisgusted with the Communist Party, they began to blame himfor setting it all up. It was Lenin, they say, who allowedStalin to carry out his huge purges and dreadful terror.   Visitors to Lenin museums and other memorials havedeclined. Some memorials have even been closed. Guides haverevised their teaching about Lenin. Once portrayed as theinfallible father of the revolution, he has been described,in recent years, as more human, as an idealist who should beforgiven his mistakes. From time to time, there has even beentalk of taking Lenin out of his tomb and burying him next tohis mother in Leningrad, where he himself wished to beburied.   &quot;I am sorry for him as a human being,&quot; says LarissaRozhnovska, 52, a factory worker from the Ukraine. &quot;Everyperson deserves to be buried in the ground.&quot;   But Joseph Stalin had other plans for the corpse. Againstthe wishes of Lenin's wife, Lenin was embalmed and placed onview in a temporary mausoleum. That spring, doctors developednew, advanced methods of embalming that they hoped wouldpreserve his body forever. The corpse, a bit waxy butlife-like, was then placed in a glass-topped coffin forpublic display -- and was an instant hit with the Sovietpublic. Soon, photos of Red Square invariably showed longlines of the Communist faithful, even in winter.   Stalin himself may have hoped for similar deification. Hiscorpse was placed alongside of Lenin's but stayed there onlyeight years. He was removed in 1961 after Nikita Khrushchev'slong speech to a party congress lambasting his brutal regime.Stalin now is buried in the Kremlin wall.   Over the years, Lenin's corpse has been removedperiodically for maintenance by an embalming laboratory.During World War II, he was evacuated to the Urals and asurrogate was put in his place. His body was purportedlyreturned after the war. But many wonder how much of him isreally left, or whether he ever came back. Some speculatethat what is now in the glass box is a clever wax modelcreated by a London wax museum sworn to secrecy.   Certainly, not all of Lenin remains under glass. After hisdeath, his brain was removed and analyzed for evidence ofgenius. His brain was compared with the brains of Stalin andthose of other prominent personalities at the Moscow BrainInstitute. The experts so far have found no relationshipbetween Lenin and Stalin's cerebral structure, according topublished reports by the institute's director.   Images of Lenin still abound in the Soviet Union, instatues, busts, bas-reliefs, paintings and posters. Sovietchildren have grown up wearing red star pins with a pictureof the baby Lenin in the center. They are steeped in histeachings and heroism.   &quot;For a man like this,&quot; says Cadredin Amerahov, a visitorfrom Azerbaijan who has just completed a visit to themausoleum and doesn't want any change in the Soviet Union,the mausoleum &quot;is too little. Our government should do betterby him. It should build him a bigger place.&quot;   Vladimir Petrov, 35, a guard who works at Red Squarecontrolling the crowds, also can't bear the idea of Lenindisappearing. &quot;I think many people want to see Lenin. Doesyour child want to see him when he grows up? He made therevolution.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
