The exemption applies to this rule.This rule simply temporarily amends the GSAR as necessary to conform tothe FAR as amended by FAC 84-45. Therefore, no regulatory flexibility analysishas been prepared. The information collection requirement on the GSA Form2419, Certification of Progress Payments Under Fixed-Price ConstructionContracts, is merely a reflection of the information collection requirementin FAR 52.232-5, Payment Under Fixed-Priced Construction Contracts, whichhas been approved by OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act and assignedControl Number 9000-0102.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects 48 CFR Parts 532, 552, and 553</ITAG>Government procurement.1.
