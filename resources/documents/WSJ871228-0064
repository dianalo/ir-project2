It's the only time when they're more likely to be sung about than shot.    Forget what you learned from &quot;The Twelve Days of Christmas.&quot; The partridge isn't a colorful inhabitant of pear trees. It's plain -- even slightly dumpy -- and it spends most of its life hiding in brush and tall grass. &quot;It's often confused with the sage grouse and quail,&quot; says Whitney Tilt, a wildlife specialist at the National Audubon Society. &quot;Without a huge leap you're into the prairie chicken.&quot;    What's more, partridges may soon be an endangered species. Real-estate development and improper timber harvesting -- to say nothing of hunters -- are taking their toll. Two of the partridge's close cousins, the Attwater prairie chicken and the masked bobwhite, are already considered endangered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.    It isn't the partridge's fault that people are confused. Misrepresentation abounds. Consider the cover of Dodd, Mead andamp; Co.'s illustrated songbook &quot;The Twelve Days of Christmas.&quot; The bird pictured in the pear tree has a topknot on its forehead -- which means it isn't a partridge at all.    &quot;OK, it isn't a partridge,&quot; confesses Rosanne Lauer, the editor of children's books at Dodd Mead. Ms. Lauer edited nature books for a while, so she knows that the bird on the cover is actually a California quail or a Gambel's quail. &quot;But,&quot; she says, &quot;when the artist's illustration came in finished, everyone here said, 'It's a beautiful bird. Let's not quibble.'&quot;    That's par for the partridge. Even though they know better, pear growers are using the bird to promote their fruit. This year the Oregon, Washington and California Pear Bureau has given away 1,500 handmade Christmas ornaments depicting a partridge in a pear tree. The group's newsletter claims that the ornaments celebrate &quot;the annual partridge return to hundreds of thousands of pear trees.&quot; But Maggie Andre, a spokeswoman, concedes that there isn't any evidence that partridges are partial to pear trees. &quot;The only basis for it is the Christmas song,&quot; she says.    Under the circumstances, Austin, Nichols andamp; Co.'s advertisement for its Wild Turkey bourbon seems downright unfair. &quot;It's better than a partridge,&quot; the ad says. &quot;And you don't need a pear tree.&quot; But Eileen Kaplan, the public-relations director for Austin Nichols, isn't apologizing. The ad is all in fun, she says.    Why a partridge in a pear tree anyway? Richard Lederer writes in Verbatim, the Language Quarterly, that a version of the song in early French had the suitor offering only a partridge, or une pertriz. A 1718 English version combined partridge and pertriz so that the line came out sounding like a partridge in a pear tree. &quot;Through the process known as folk etymology,&quot; Mr. Lederer writes, &quot;the partridge has remained proudly perched in a pear tree ever since.&quot;    Since the song was written, the partridge has suffered other musical indignities. Consider the Partridge Family, a rock group formed by American Broadcasting Cos. for a television series that ran from 1970 to 1974. An ABC spokesman says the network picked the name &quot;because it sounds cute.&quot; In any case, the Partridge Family became &quot;the leading disciples of schlock family rock,&quot; according to David Wild, the music editor of Rolling Stone magazine.    One problem is that the partridge doesn't have a champion. Its elegant cousin, the ruffed grouse, has the Ruffed Grouse Society, based in Coraopolis, Pa. The group, which includes hunters, lobbies government and private landowners for careful forest management.    But the partridge -- with its unremarkable combination of brown, black and gray markings, short rounded wings and stubby tail -- hasn't attracted such a following. Most hunters in upland areas are more interested in the better-known birds: pheasants, grouse and quails.    In fact, some partridges are shot because they fly up suddenly and fast, and hunters mistake them for more desirable quarry. &quot;They explode out of the bushes, and you can't tell where they're going,&quot; says Robert Jantzen, a hunting consultant from Great Falls, Va. &quot;One flew right between my knees.&quot;    Still, there are people who hunt partridges on purpose. They see their sport as more genteel than sloshing around a marsh honking for ducks. &quot;You're out in the flaming hillsides of fall on a bracing day with your English setter,&quot; says Assistant Secretary of the Interior William Horn.    Partridges aren't native to North America. In the early 1900s, federal wildlife officials captured some of them in Europe and Asia and brought them back to the U.S. Now, they are mostly found in the shrinking wilderness of New York, parts of New England, the Upper Midwest, Nevada, Montana and Washington state. The three U.S. species -- the chukar, the gray (or Hungarian) and the snow partridge -- are among 10 pheasant family members in North America.    Each spring, male partridges start the mating ritual by spreading their tail feathers and pretending to pick up twigs for a nest. The males never actually do any building, though. Females scratch out a hollow in the ground and line it with leaves before they lay some 15 eggs.    But finding nesting sites is getting tougher. Large chunks of the partridge's habitat in the Northeast have matured into tall forests over the past two decades, and they no longer provide much brush or tall grass. &quot;Without greenbriars and grapevines, there's no place to hide if the fox or hawk is around,&quot; says the Interior Department's Mr. Horn.    His agency is holding seminars for timber companies and other landowners, asking them to harvest adjacent strips of trees five years apart. That approach would provide the wide variety of grasses, brush and small trees that give shelter and food to partridges.    One of the companies involved is Westvaco Corp. It owns 1.4 million acres of land, including a few abandoned pear orchards. Kenney Funderburke, the manager of new business projects for Westvaco, is optimistic that the proposed forestry methods will reverse the recent decline in the partridge population. Meanwhile, he says, the pear trees are there for any creatures that &quot;want to nibble.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
