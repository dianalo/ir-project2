Perry (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><G> EXE CNG </G><DATELINE> NEW ORLEANS  </DATELINE><TEXT>   While George Bush's rousing speech at the Republican national convention gave his campaign a much-needed boost, his triumph was clouded by his selection of Indiana Sen. Dan Quayle as his running mate.    That was the assessment of The Wall Street Journal's regular panel of political experts. Agreeing that actions speak louder than words, the panelists aren't impressed by the Quayle choice.    &quot;Dan Quayle is the Pat Sajak candidate,&quot; chides Democrat Alan Baron. Mr. Sajak is the youthful, blow-dried host of the television game show, &quot;Wheel of Fortune.&quot;    &quot;The best the Bush people are hoping for,&quot; says the panel's other Democrat, pollster Peter Hart, &quot;is that Dan Quayle will just disappear.&quot;    Kevin Phillips, a Republican, notes that both Messrs. Bush and Quayle are millionaires. &quot;The ticket is a casting room for silver spoons,&quot; he says.    The most charitable comment comes from John Sears, the other Republican on the panel. &quot;I wouldn't have picked him,&quot; says Mr. Sears, adding that Mr. Quayle does bring &quot;some fresh blood to the national circuit&quot; and that the Indiana senator is &quot;unlikely to outshine the top of the ticket.&quot;    Even so, for all these problems, the Journal's political experts agree this will end up a close election. One of the reasons, they say, is that Michael Dukakis seems to be coasting. He threatens, they note, to become his party's Thomas E. Dewey. In 1948, Mr. Dewey had a big lead over President Harry Truman -- and coasted straight to defeat.    The four political sages met with Wall Street Journal editors and reporters the morning after the Republican convention ended (Mr. Hart participated by telephone) to analyze what happened here and to look ahead at the general election.    Messrs. Sears and Baron insist it is still Mr. Bush's election to win or lose. There are powerful issues benefiting the GOP cause, they agree. Mr. Phillips and Mr. Hart aren't so sure. They see Republican vulnerabilities the Democrats can -- and should -- exploit.    Mr. Bush's acceptance speech should have been an auspicious start for the campaign. &quot;The speech was good,&quot; says Mr. Sears, &quot;because, in tone, it was the first time I've ever seen him presidential -- authoritative, powerful. There was even humor in it, sort of Reaganesque. It was good stuff. I could still see George Bush, but this guy looked different from what I normally see.&quot;    Mr. Phillips still expresses reservations. &quot;If you didn't care too much for George Bush when you turned him on, you would have found that periodic tinniness in what he was saying that would have kept you in that state of mind.&quot;    Anyway, the Republican panelists agree, much of the credit for the success of the speech should go to speechwriter Peggy Noonan. (Republican hopes to boost the television audience for their convention failed, however; the TV audience was slightly larger for the Democrats' convention.)    But both Democratic analysts were impressed by Mr. Bush. Mr. Baron says the speech &quot;did focus on the major thing Bush needs to do -- turn the election into a referendum on the direction the country should go.&quot; Peter Hart agrees that the GOP nominee &quot;defined the race fairly well. Give him credit,&quot; Mr. Hart says.    Nevertheless, the choice of Mr. Quayle and the ensuing uproar about whether he used influence to join the National Guard and escape combat service in Vietnam in 1969, &quot;tromped all over what Mr. Bush was trying to accomplish,&quot; contends Mr. Hart.    &quot;They didn't get what they needed out of this convention,&quot; says Mr. Phillips. &quot;They needed a clear, compelling statement, and the Quayle selection interfered with that. They had it all written down on the yellow pad, but they didn't get the message out on the wires. There was too much interference from the other stories.&quot;    The Quayle selection, says Mr. Phillips, &quot;casts doubt on several aspects of George Bush that have troubled Republican strategists previously.&quot; First, he says, &quot;there's his difficulty in pairing himself with major party figures who might seem to be a threat to him. Second, there's his desire to have someone with whom he is culturally and socio-economically comfortable. It narrows his outreach.&quot;    The Quayle choice, says Mr. Baron, &quot;conveys the impression he's running for president of the country club instead of president of the country.&quot;    &quot;The wealth thing is serious,&quot; he continues. &quot;There's one perception the people have had for 40 years -- that the Republicans are the party of the rich people and the Demcrats are the party of the poor. Voters don't mind if the Democrats pick a millionaire because he and the party represent poor people.&quot;    &quot;The Republicans are just not very comfortable when they talk about wealth,&quot; says Mr. Hart. &quot;They don't relate to the average person. With Democrats, from John Kennedy to (Sen.) Jay (John) Rockefeller (D., W.Va.), there's a sense of fighting (the poor's) cause. With George Bush and Dan Quayle, there's no sense of that linkage.&quot;    Mr. Quayle, he says, is not a very likely candidate to reach out to Republicans who once voted for John Anderson or Democrats who voted for President Reagan. Even without the controversies surrounding his past, most of the experts agree, the selection didn't make Mr. Bush look very presidential.    The panelists dismiss polls made during the convention -- &quot;statistical gibberish,&quot; says Mr. Phillips. (Newsweek magazine reported Saturday that a poll taken last Thursday and Friday showed Mr. Bush leading Mr. Dukakis by a 51%-to-42% margin.) But they agree the post-convention polls that start coming out this week are likely to show a very close race.    A major factor, the panelists agree, is that the Democrats haven't taken advantage of opportunities a Bush candidacy offers them.    &quot;If the Democrats lose this election,&quot; says Mr. Sears, &quot;it will be traced to the fact that for three months or more they did nothing much more than read their own polls. They should have been out there hardening support flowing away from George Bush.&quot;    The electorate is still very fluid, says Mr. Sears, &quot;and it will be a problem for the Democrats if the campaign now moves to a discussion of the Republican issues.&quot;    The Democrats have two problems, says Mr. Phillips. &quot;The first is the experience problem. It is difficult for Dukakis to leap from governor of Massachusetts to president of the United States. The second is that Dukakis is doing a Tom Dewey imitation. He apparently doesn't think he has to do anything.&quot;    &quot;We need to send a wake-up call out to the Democrats,&quot; agrees Mr. Hart. &quot;They had better become a lot more aggressive than they've been up until now. They should be hitting hard at issues out there -- ethics, medical wastes on the beaches -- all the domestic stuff.&quot;    The next big stop on the road to the White House will be the first presidential debate. It will be crucial, the panelists all agree. &quot;George Bush still needs a re-evaluation on his leadership,&quot; says Mr. Hart, and the first debate will provide another opportunity.    &quot;Dukakis has an enormous amount at stake,&quot; says Mr. Phillips. &quot;He's a TV personality. He had his own TV show. People will expect him to do very well.&quot; Mr. Dukakis was moderator for public television's &quot;The Advocates&quot; program from 1971 to 1973.    Both candidates, says Mr. Sears, will have a hard time determining whether they should defend their base or try to be aggressive.    Mr. Hart sees only one thing certain about the campaign: &quot;It will be vicious all the way through.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
