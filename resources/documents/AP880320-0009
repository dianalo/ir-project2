Meanwhile, in Texas, the Democratic Party was slow in tabulatingthe results of county conventions and caucuses. However, with 2,508of the 5,288 delegates accounted for, Jesse Jackson had 1028,Dukakis 895 and 276 were uncommitted.   Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. had 235 local delegates, MissouriRep. Richard Gephardt 57, Illinois Sen. Paul Simon 16 and formercandidate Gary Hart 1.   Based on the results, Jackson will capture 27 of the 64delegates Texas will allot through its second-track system, Dukakiswill gain 24 and 13 will be uncommitted.   Texas already distributed 119 delegates based on the results ofthe Super Tuesday primary, with Dukakis winning 43, Jackson 42,Gore 25 and Gephardt nine.   With 115 of the Kansas caucuses reporting their results to stateparty headquarters in Topeka, Dukakis had 278 delegates, JesseJackson 235, Sen. Albert Gore Jr. 125 and Gephardt 12. Another 114local delegates had been elected in uncommitted status.   No Democrats turned out in Greeley and Wichita counties in farwestern Kansas, reducing the number of caucus sites from 117 to 115and the number of local delegates selected from 768 to 764.   ``It's terrific,'' Dukakis said at the Jefferson-Jackson dinnerin Detroit, where all the Democratic hopefuls except Jacksongathered Saturday night. ``We've had a major victory in Kansas andfeel good about it. Now we're on to Michigan and here we are.''   Asked about the significance of the Kansas win, Dukakis said,``I think it's the first farm and agriculture state that I've wonand won decisively. I think that's a very good sign for thefuture.''   Dukakis picked up 16 of the 39 national delegates at stake inKansas. Added to the six delegates he gained earlier in the nightin South Dakota, Dukakis maintained his Democratic lead in thedelegate race with 503.5, according to The Associated Press survey.   Jackson garnered 14 delegates in Kansas for a total of 483.55and Gore gained 5 for 362.8. Four of Kansas' delegates wereuncommitted, raising the national total to 276.65.   A total of 2,082 delegates are needed to nominate.   Gephardt, who captured nine delegates in South Dakota for atotal of 154, said he wasn't really concerned about Kansas and thathis campaign's focus has been on Michigan for the last couple ofweeks.   ``I'm concerned about doing well Michigan and I think we will,''said Gephardt, who also spoke at the Detroit dinner.   Michigan holds caucuses next Saturday to decide 138 delegates.   Gore, who also was campaigning in Michigan, said the Kansascaucuses ``looks like ... a contest that's going to be divided upbetween the three front-runners. We expect to get our share ofdelegates in Kansas. I'm very pleased with the results as they'recoming in.''   Illinois Sen. Paul Simon, who has 171.5 delegates, said beforethe start of the Jefferson-Jackson dinner that he expected theparty to have to go through a bitter convention fight to selectsits nominee.   ``I'm just saying that's a reality,'' Simon said. Even thecurrent front runner, Dukakis, would have to win about 80 percentof the remaining delegates to wrap up the nomination on the firstballot, he said, adding, ``That just isn't going to happen.''   But Gore rejected that view, saying, ``Some things that peoplethink are inevitable turn out not to be. The race for thenomination is wide open. Anybody who thinks otherwise at this pointis going to be surprised.''   In South Dakota, which has 15 delegates at stake, Democratshonored the results of the Feb. 23 primary in which Gephardtreceived 44 percent of the vote and Dukakis 31 percent.   ``This is a good demonstration of Democratic unity in SouthDakota,'' said Rick Hauffe, the newly named executive director ofthe state Democratic Party. ``It's going to go uphill from here.''   In a poll conducted for The Detroit News, Dukakis garnered thesupport of 33 percent of the 385 people who said they likely wouldvote in the Michigan caucuses.   Jackson received 31 percent, while Gephardt was a distant thirdwith 10 percent, said the survey, which was published in Sundayeditions. Former Colorado Sen. Gary Hart, who has dropped out ofthe race, received 7 percent of the vote, while Gore had 5 percentand Simon 2 percent.   The survey had a margin of error of 5 percentage points.   Among Republicans, front-runner George Bush was expected tocapture the 14 delegates at stake in the winner-take-all primary inPuerto Rico on Sunday. The vice president was the only GOPcandidate to mount an organized campaign on the island.   In a poll conducted by The Milwaukee Journal, Bush held asubstantial lead over his GOP rivals among Republicans who willvote in the Wisconsin primary on April 5.   Bush had 69 percent, Kansas Sen. Bob Dole had 25 percent and PatRobertson had 6 percent. The survey of Republican voters had amargin of error of 6 percent.   Among the Democrats, Dukakis led with 38 percent, Jackson wassecond with 30 percent, Gephardt and Simon tied for third with 11percent and Gore was fifth with 10 percent.
