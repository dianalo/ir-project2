(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A new 620-room casino hotel is on thedrawing board for Resorts International Inc., a company alreadyburdened with massive debt.   When entertainer Merv Griffin purchased Resorts Internationallast November, he inherited the obligation to develop AtlanticCity's Uptown Urban Renewal Tract, long a desolate site just a fewblocks away from the Resorts casino.   Earlier this week, Resorts officials submitted plans to theAtlantic City Housing Authority for the 56-acre plot. A60,000-square-foot casino with a 32-story hotel tower and2,860-space parking garage will take up about 14 acres, according tothe designs.   Resorts also outlined plans for the rest of the tract, includinga shopping center and parking spaces.   The plans were submitted several weeks after Resorts quietlyannounced it hired the Salomon Brothers investment banking firm tohelp it refinance its enormous corporate debt.   Resorts has more than $900 million in long-term debt, including$200 million in mortgage bonds and $125 million in notes thatGriffin sold to finance his takeover of the company from developerDonald Trump.   Gaming analyst Marvin B. Roffman of the Philadelphia investmentfirm Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. said Wednesday that Resorts' plansfor the renewal tract ``are all pie in the sky.''   ``This company is going to have to restructure, period. Thesooner, the better,'' he said. ``There is no way in the world thatany sane person would lend this company any more money. Everyone onWall Street is against them.''   Roffman said that Resorts management also needs to prove it canrun a casino without losing market share. The gaming hall's marketshare has declined in the past year.   Resorts officials said they do not plan to build or finance theproposed casino hotel, estimated to cost $262 million. ChristopherWhitney, Resorts' chief of staff, said the company is looking for athird party to finance the project.   Resorts had already received two extensions on a deadline tosubmit its proposals to the housing authority, but was deniedanother extension request.   Resorts is now obligated to take title to the land from thehousing authority by September for the first phase of the project,which includes the shopping center, said authority director JohnMcAvaddy. Construction must begin 90 days after the land isacquired, he said.   The second phase of the proposal, which focuses on the casino,must be acquired by next April, he said.   The authority realizes Resorts' financial predicament, McAvaddysaid Wednesday.   ``That is the reason they are seeking a joint venture partner,because the financial picture indicates there might be a problem infinancing the development in-house,'' he said.   Resorts may be viewed with skepticism when it does startdeveloping the renewal tract. In 1976, Resorts bought developmentrights to the tract for $5.6 million and promised to build at least1,200 housing units and an accompanying shopping center.   But the acreage bounced along with the changing owners ofResorts. Under Resorts founder James Crosby, the development wasstalled by litigation from a prior developer and state claims.   When Crosby died in 1986, Trump bought the gaming hall andunveiled plans for a complex that would have been like a city withina city.   Griffin purchased Resorts from Trump last year. The new proposalexplores transferring the housing obligation from the urban renewaltract to other Resorts property in the city.   McAvaddy said the housing authority is willing to discuss thatpossibility.   ``If they do build housing within the tract, it would probably beupper-middle or luxury housing, and it would not meet the demands toserve the people we're aiming it for,'' he said.   Even the proposed shopping center might be better placed,McAvaddy said, perhaps closer to new housing developments in thecity's inlet section.   Resorts has the option of modifying its plans in the next fewmonths, he said, until the time when preliminary construction plansare due.</TEXT></DOC>
