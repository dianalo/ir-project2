Charged in an indictment unsealed Thursday were Glen N. Mauldin,who was an aide to former U.S. Sen. Jacob ``Chic'' Hecht of Nevada;Darrell A. Tomblin, a businessman now living in Houston; and VincentP. Lachelli, a Washington, D.C., lobbyist.   The indictment alleges Mauldin was to receive a 10 percentinterest in the acquired savings and loans and a financial interestin several Grenada business ventures for his role in the scheme.   ``The indictments announced today arise against a backdrop of thefailing savings and loan institutions and industry in Texas,'' HelenEversberg, U.S. attorney for the Western District of Texas, saidThursday.   ``The scheme emanated from San Antonio and ultimately wove itsway to the halls of Congress in Washington, D.C.,'' she said.   The 22-count indictment charges each of the three with conspiringto deprive the U.S. government of the honest services of Mauldin andto corrupt the functions of the U.S. Senate and the Federal HomeLoan Bank Board.   The three defendants were arrested and appeared in bond hearingsThursday afternoon, Ms. Eversberg said.   The indictment states that Mauldin, Tomblin and Lachelli embarkedon a scheme beginning in 1987 aimed at acquiring 10 savings andloans across the United States.   Mauldin used Senate stationery to write letters to federalagencies in an attempt to assist with the thrift acquisition andbusiness ventures in Grenada, the indictment alleges.   The Grenada business plans included an oil refinery, a commercialfishing venture and spices grown in that country, the indictmentclaims.   Lachelli did not return a telephone call Thursday. Mauldin didnot answer his phone in Washington.   David Botsford, an attorney for Tomblin, said he would commentafter he had received a copy of the indictment.   Ms. Eversberg would not comment on whether prosecutors believeHecht knew of the alleged bribery that supposedly involved hisoffice. ``He was not charged in this indictment and he cooperatedwith the FBI as soon as they approached him,'' she said.   Formerly a Republican member of the Senate Banking Committee,Hecht served one term in the Senate before losing in the 1988general election to Democrat Dick Bryan. Hecht now is ambassador tothe Bahamas.   The San Antonio U.S. Attorney's Office began investigating thecase with the help of informant Leo Arnold Ladouceur, who had beenindicted with his wife on bank fraud charges in 1988.   Ladouceur and two others pleaded guilty to charges Wednesdayrelating to the bilking of millions of dollars from Suburban SavingsAssociation in San Antonio.   A plea-bargain agreement indicated Ladouceur would not beprosecuted for any dealings with Mauldin, Tomblin, Lachelli andothers.</TEXT></DOC>
