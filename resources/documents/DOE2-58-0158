<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-58-0158 </DOCNO><TEXT>Papers are presented on the mechanical properties of IR glasses and fibers,Te halide glasses for IR fibers, and electrooptic and magnetooptic effectsin heavy metal oxide glasses. Also considered are properties of fluorozirconatefibers for applications in the 0.5 to 4.5 micron region, optical andmechanical properties of chalcogenide fibers, and an improved As2Se3IR optical fiber. Other topics include aging effects in extruded polycrystallineTl bromoiodide fibers, optical and mechanical properties of silver halidefibers, and light scattering by voids in polycrystalline fibers. Papersare also presented on stimulated Brillouin scattering switching in mid-IRfibers, a tunable titanium doped sapphire fiber laser, and an IR fibertemperature sensing system.</TEXT></DOC>
