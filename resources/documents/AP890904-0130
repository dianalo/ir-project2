Interior Minister Istvan Horvath was quoted as telling the WestGerman weekly Stern that East and West Germany need to agree on therefugee crisis, and this could take ``perhaps a month, or 1{''months.   The hardline East German government is angry over the plannedmass exodus and Hungary's role in it.   A well-placed Hungarian official, who spoke to The AssociatedPress on condition of anonymity, also cited ``need for furthertalks'' with East Germany before Hungary gives the go-ahead for anorganized mass departure to West Germany via Austria.   As recently as Sunday, West German and Hungarian officials hadsuggested the departure was imminent of 4,700 East Germans markingtime in tents and summer cabins at five makeshift refugee camps inHungary.   East German refugees began fleeing to the West through Hungaryafter the liberal communist regime in Budapest decided in May toremove barbed wire and other obstacles from its frontier withAustria.   Since May, an estimated 6,000 East Germans have fled to Austria.Their final destination is West Germany, which gives them automaticcitizenship and generous help in starting new lives.   Interior Ministry spokesmen were not available to comment on theStern interview Monday.   But a woman answering the telephone at the ministry secretariatsaid Horvath spoke to Stern Aug. 29, two days before Rezso Nyers,president of the Hungarian Communist Party, promised West GermanSocial Democrat politician Karsten Voigt the East Germans couldleave.   Many East Germans waiting to go West have told reporters theyfear they'll be fired and face legal action if they return.   But in a statement issued by its Budapest consulate late Monday,East Germany promised for the first time that those coming homewould have the right to return to their jobs. It said anew theywould not face punishment and could apply for emigration once theyreturned home.   Some of the East Germans have been waiting to leave for more thana month, and Monday's news of a possible delay struck like abombshell.   At one Budapest camp _ off-limits to reporters like the fourothers _ dozens broke off lunches, rushing out the main gate to mobWestern reporters to ask if Horvath's comments were true.   ``The bread almost fell out of my mouth,'' said a 39-year-oldengineer from Dresden with two children. ``If that's true, I'mfinished, I have to go back to East Germany. I have no more money,and my children are sick.''   ``They can't do this to us,'' said a young, single mother, hereyes brimming over with tears. ``We've been here for 15 days, andnow they're taking away our last hope.''   Earlier, West German diplomat Gunter Mulack told reporters Bonnwas just waiting for Budapest's word to launch the caravan westwardthrough Austria to newly built tent cities in Bavaria.   The refugee camp behind him appeared quieter than usual. Mostresidents were inside because of rain and unseasonable cold.   This would be the largest single transfer of East Germans to theWest since the Berlin Wall was built in August 1961 and would be anunprecedented case of cooperation between a Soviet bloc and NATOnation to resettle citizens of another Eastern European nation inthe West.   More than 500 new arrivals registered Monday with Red Crossofficials managing the four camps in Budapest and a fifth thatopened Friday at Zanka on the shores of Lake Balaton.   The lake is popular with the 1 million East German tourists whovisit Hungary each year. Up to 200,000 East Germans are thought tobe in Hungary now and Premier Miklos Nemeth has said 20,000 may wantto go to West Germany.   Hungarian officials said solving the problem was up to the twoGermanys, but then Nyers told Voigt the East Germans would beallowed to go West. That, in effect, breaks Hungary's 1969 agreementwith East Germany to return those caught trying to flee.   Budapest's decision embittered the East Germans, whose leadershave criticized reforms in Hungary and its moves toward multipartydemocracy.   Escape through Hungary to Austria peaked in late August, withhundreds of East Germans crossing daily. The Hungarians, apparentlyconcerned about East German anger, strengthened border patrols andthe flow was cut to a few dozen each night.   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl has urged his countrymen towelcome the East Germans.   State assistance has spawned some resentment there.</TEXT></DOC>
