Some Tokyo issues plunged 8% to 10% as the Nikkei stock average dropped 654.81 points to 23328.64, the third-largest single-day point decline. The steepest fall was the 831.32-point plunge April 27.    London issues also declined. However, a stronger dollar helped lift Frankfurt and Zurich prices.    In Sydney, most Australian stock prices were firmer, with the leading market barometer closing at a record. The Australian stock market often takes its immediate cue from the price of gold, and while the price dropped in New York Friday, it recovered $2 an ounce to around $450 during the Australian session, boosting some issues. Industrial stocks were bolstered by Wall Street's advance Friday and more cuts in Australia's interest rates.    South African gold issues also moved up with the price of bullion, as the Johannesburg gold index rose 9 points to 2290. However, London's gold mines index fell 4.9 to 424.8.    In Hong Kong, prices pushed through to their fifth consecutive high in heavy trading, with bank and utility stocks again leading the charge.    Zurich prices ended higher too, as the dollar's firmness sent foreigners rushing to buy banking and insurance issues.    In Tokyo, the yen's relative softness against the dollar and corresponding weakness in the prices of Japanese government bonds moved investors to sell stocks across the board, traders said. Cash bond prices took a beating despite a 100 billion yen ($653.8 million) buying operation by Japan's finance ministry.    Investors in the debt and equity markets alike fear an erosion in the value of yen-denominated instruments against those denominated in other currencies, an analyst said.    Newspaper reports yesterday that suggested some Japanese banks are considering an increase in the long-term prime lending rate also soured sentiment in the stock market, as did the prospect of higher world oil prices as a consequence of increasing political-military tensions in the Persian Gulf.    In addition to the Nikkei's plunge, the first section index fell 57.48 to 1939.21. Turnover totaled 400 million shares, down from 500 million shares Friday. Decliners outnumbered gainers 774 to 172, while 85 issues were unchanged.    Some important bellwether issues ended far lower, with rail and hotel giant Tokyu down 150 yen at 1390 yen ($9.09), Mitsubishi Chemical down 100 at 1010, and Sumitomo Trust down 330 at 3530. Other banking issues also tumbled, with Bank of Tokyo down 90 at 1550.    Export-dependent issues generally were firmer on the dollar's strength, with electrical and computer products maker TDK up 250 at 4450, Sony up 70 at 4220, and NEC up 60 at 1950. Auto maker Toyota rose 10 to 1790, Nissan Motor edged up 5 to 685, and Isuzu Motors moved up 2 to 380.    London prices closed sharply lower across the board, in what dealers called a technical correction to the market's recent strong rally. In the two weeks ended Thursday, prices had closed at highs nine times in 10 sessions.    Yesterday the 100-share index, which slipped 14.7 points Friday, fell 28 to 2400.7. The Financial Times 30-share index was down 27.3 at 1889.6. Volume fell to 676.6 million shares from 769.9 million Friday.    Concerns that interest rates could rise also fueled bearish sentiment, dealers said. Figures released yesterday showed that British bank lending rose sharply to #3.9 billion ($6.25 billion) in June from #2.7 billion in May, stoking concern that Britain's economy may be overheating, analysts said.    However, market makers marked down prices from the outset in the wake of the steep fall in Tokyo stocks, dealers said. The dollar's strength also contributed to lower stock prices, they said.    A 3.1% rise in British retail sales last month lifted retail issues one pence or so off their day's low, with Dixons down 4 pence at 378 pence ($6.05) at day's end, Great Universal Stores off 28 pence at #14.34 pounds ($22.97), Boots off 10 at 304 and Next off 8 at 345. Burton rose 1 to 335.    General insurers rose, boosted by takeover rumors surrounding Royal Insurance, which was up 27 at 587. Most banks were lower, with Barclays down 1 at 644, Midland Bank down 1 at 643, National Westminster Bank down 3 at 780 and Standard Chartered Bank down 2 at 810. Lloyds Bank, which is expected to announce a big increase in debt provisions when it reports first-half earnings Friday, fell 9 to 415.    Frankfurt prices rose across the board, with the dollar's advance above 1.86 West German marks triggering a buying spree by foreign investors. Almost all blue-chips continued their advance of last week.    Boosted by the sharp rise in oil prices, raw materials issues continued to pace the market. Metal and energy concern Preussag jumped 7.5 marks to 198 marks ($106.28). It has gained 25% the past two weeks. Veba was up 2.8 at 313.3. Hoechst continued to pace chemical issues, rising 4.3 to 325.4, while BASF was up 3.4 to 318.8.    Financial issues are expected to benefit from the recent upturn in the stock market, which is likely to boost commission income. Deutsche Bank, West Germany's largest commercial bank, rose 9 to 673. Dresdner Bank was up 4.2 at 347, and Commerzbank advanced 2.5 to 295.5.    Most automobile issues didn't participate in the day's advance, although Daimler-Benz rose 4 to 1174.
