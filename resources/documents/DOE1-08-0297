After ion bombardment the change of refractivity of glass surfacehas been measured. It has been found that the change of refractivityis concerned with Na ion migrations of glass surface during Ar ion bombardmentand consists with Na composition contribution measured by NRA in relatedreferences. Network damage and volume contraction during Ar ion bombardmentwas observed.</TEXT></DOC>
