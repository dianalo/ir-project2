On thisissue, not at all,'' said James Shriver of the Gallup Organization.``It just seems to be a bedrock opinion that has been unshaken byall the turmoil.''   Not all polls are in accord. While most show no trends, somehave tracked a slight decline in support for abortion in the 1980s,when President Reagan took a strong anti-abortion posture. Stillothers see pro-abortion shifts.   The difference, owing to the issue's sensitivity and theambivalence many Americans feel toward abortion, is the wording ofquestions used to track opinion. Polls find Americans personallydisapprove of abortion _ most call it murder _ but at the sametime, most are loathe to restrict it.   Consequently, some movement against abortion appears in NationalOpinion Research Center polls that pose specific circumstancesunder which abortions may be sought. Polls on broader policy views,however, show no movement.   Gallup, for example, has asked since 1975 simply whetherabortion should be legal under any circumstances, under certaincircumstances, or illegal. The most liberal group has fluctuatedfrom 21 percent to 25 percent; the middle, 52 percent to 57percent; and abortion opponents, 17 percent to 22 percent.   As a trend, Shriver said recently, ``That's absolutely flat.''   But NORC, at the University of Chicago, has found changes inacceptance of abortion under specific conditions. Support forabortion for a married woman who did not want more children slippedfrom 47 percent in 1980 to 40 percent in 1988; those saying povertywas grounds for abortion fell from 52 percent to 42 percent; andthose accepting abortion for an unwed woman who did not want tomarry the father fell from 48 percent to 39 percent.   NORC pollster Tom Smith, who classified these movements as``quite small but regular,'' attributed them to the Reaganadministration's anti-abortion posture and aggressive campaigningby anti-abortion groups. It follows that such efforts, making theirappeal at a personal level, would have an effect on the morepersonal poll questions.   Kathleen A. Frankovic, a CBS News pollster, agreed thatanti-abortion activity may have made it more comfortable sociallyto express anti-abortion opinions. Still, she noted, broadermeasures _ focused more on policy matters than on personal views _have not moved consistently.   A CBS News-New York Times question, for instance, has found aslight increase in support for current abortion law, from 38percent in 1985 to 46 percent this year. And the share approving oflegal abortion if a woman and her doctor agree on it has heldsteady _ 62 percent in 1980, 61 percent now.   The group saying no to abortions if the woman and her doctoragree was 19 percent in 1980, 25 percent in early 1981, 22 percentlater in 1981 and 25 percent this year; with a 3-point error marginand no annual figures through most of the 1980s, it is difficult todiscern a trend.   In NBC News-Wall Street Journal polling, those saying decisionson abortion should be left to a woman and her doctor made up 78percent in 1980 and 72 percent this year. That also was within themargin of error, and there was even less movement in the group, inanother question, that said abortion should not be illegal:Sixty-one percent in 1982, 62 percent in 1989.   Similarly, a Harris poll question since 1973 has asked ifrespondents favor or oppose that year's U.S. Supreme Court rulinglegalizing abortion. Support was at 52 percent in 1973 _ and 56percent this year.   ``What we find is that people feel that a woman should have theright to have an abortion, but they personally feel uncomfortableabout abortions,'' said Mary Klette, an NBC pollster. ``It's just avery personal opinion, and no matter what happens, it doesn'tchange.''</TEXT></DOC>
