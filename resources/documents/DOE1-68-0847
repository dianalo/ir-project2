These two techniques give similar resultsexcept for pyrazine for with strong bands, observed only in the SER spectrumon the electrode, may be due to reduction products coadsorbed on theAg surface. Chemisorption plays a role in the absorption of diazinesas evidence of Ag-N bond formation was found in the SERS of all threemolecules. Both N atoms of pyridazine are bound to the substrate andthis explains an enhancement, for the latter molecule, of 2 orders ofmagnitude larger than for the other two compounds. The presence of low-frequencyAg-N modes and predictions of surface selection rules support edge on,rather than flat, orientation of diazines on the colloidal particles.</TEXT></DOC>
