The scourge of scandal has turned investors' annual Augustexodus into a stampede. Daily trading volume on the TokyoStock Exchange, which soared above one billion shares duringthe market's heyday two years ago, has stagnated at aroundthe 200 million-share mark -- its lowest level since 1984.Yesterday, about 220 million shares changed hands.</LP><TEXT>   Trading has been off in the bond market, too. Bond tradingvolume fell 15.4% in July from the previous month to 78.141trillion yen ($571.34 billion), a six-year low, the JapanSecurities Dealers Association said.   The sluggish turnover bodes ill for Tokyo stock prices,analysts said, because it exacerbates a host of negativetechnical and supply and demand factors. Indeed, some fearthat the combination could drag the benchmark Nikkei averageof 225 shares below the 20000-point level, piercing lastyear's record low.   &quot;So far, we've only felt the tremors, not the earthquake,&quot;said Craig Chudler, an analyst at the Tokyo office of UBSPhillips andamp; Drew Securities Ltd.   Share prices slipped again Thursday. The Nikkei average,which gained 521.30 points Wednesday on the strength ofindex-linked arbitrage trading, dropped 374.62, or 1.6%, to23018.68. The Tokyo Stock Price Index, or Topix, of all firstsection issues, which rose 22.69 points Wednesday, declined17.49 to 1772.05. Declining issues outnumbered gaining issues648-265.   In Tokyo Friday, the Nikkei rose 46.46 points to close themorning session at 23065.14.   Bond prices closed lower, too. The benchmark No. 129 issueof 10-year Japanese government bonds dropped 0.11 to 99.69,with a yield of 6.455%, up 0.02 percentage point fromWednesday.   While a few analysts believe Tokyo share prices will riseover the next several months, most of them are skeptical of asubstantial recovery soon. &quot;I'm not so bullish,&quot; saidTakatoshi Okuyama, an analyst with the investment advisorydivision of Daiwa Securities Co. &quot;At the moment, the minds ofJapan's investors have cooled.&quot;   By contrast, London's stock market continued to heat up.Investors in Britain were cheered by Thursday'ssmaller-than-expected increase in German interest rates, andLondon's benchmark stock index closed at a new high, topplingthe record it set only a day earlier. Frankfurt share pricesgained slightly, but trading was light in anticipation of theGerman central bank's decision to lift rates.   In Tokyo, meanwhile, the normally frenetic stock marketalways slows this month, as investors briefly indulge insummer rituals: visiting ancestral gravesites and watchingthe high school baseball championships on television.   But the primary source of the chill this August is theblizzard of disclosures of questionable business practices inJapan's securities industry, analysts said. Revelations thatsome of Japan's largest securities firms had businessdealings with organized-crime bosses and paid billions of yento compensate favored clients for investment losses prior toMarch 1990 have prompted thousands of the nation's smallinvestors to pull their money out of the stock market.   Officials at Japan's Finance Ministry are hurriedlydrafting legal and institutional changes designed to revampthe securities industry and repair its tarnished image. Someof the measures under consideration would give clear legaldefinition to compensation and stipulate criminal punishmentsfor improper paybacks. But the ministry has brushed asidecalls for a Japanese version of the U.S. Securities andExchange Commission, and it isn't clear whether the measureswill be enough to restore individual investors' confidence.   The ministry's reforms are unlikely to take effect beforethe end of the month, and in the interim, market participantssee plenty of problems that will magnify the effect of smallinvestors' aversion to stocks. The expiration of trillions ofyen of margin positions is among the largest of theseworries. Margin investors, who borrow heavily to financetheir investments using existing shares as collateral, piledinto the Tokyo stock market in record numbers in February andMarch on sixmonth loan contracts.   Now, with Tokyo stock prices down, analysts are worriedthat as much as 50% of the five trillion yen of marginpurchases outstanding could be liquidated before the end ofthe month. Ordinarily, that wouldn't matter much. Even attheir current inflated levels, margin contracts account foronly about 1.4% of capitalization of the first section on theTokyo Stock Exchange. But with volumes so low, marginliquidations mean trouble: The value of shares purchased onmargin now is equal to 20 times the value of shares tradedeach day.   Institutional investors show signs of retreat, as well. InJune, the value of shares held in trust funds and the special&quot;tokkin&quot; investment accounts preferred by the nation's bigcorporations fell 124.7 billion yen to 32.2 trillion yen,their first decrease in four months, according to MatthewBerlow, an economist at Credit Lyonnais Securities (Japan)Ltd. He said that Japan's big firms, suddenly strapped forfunds, are cashing out of equities to maintain theirambitious capital-expenditure plans.   &quot;The selling pressure on the trust funds is the strongestit's been in 20 months,&quot; UBS Phillips andamp; Drew's Mr. Chudlersaid.   But share prices could get a boost later in the year ifBank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno lowers the officialdiscount rate, the interest rate the central bank charges thefinancial institutions that borrow from it, for the secondtime this year.   &quot;We've entered a very favorable environment for monetaryeasing,&quot; said Kermit L. Schoenholtz, an economist at SalomonBrothers Asia Ltd. Many analysts are forecasting a rate dropsoon after the Bank of Japan releases its next quarterlysurvey of Japanese business conditions in early September,and a third reduction sometime in the first quarter of nextyear.   &quot;We look forward to an improvement in share prices&quot; afterthe anticipated rate cut, Daiwa's Mr. Okuyama said. &quot;Thismarket needs some good news.&quot;   In London, stocks rose Thursday mainly on buying stemmingfrom continuing optimism about a strong recovery in theBritish economy soon, but with a slightly longer upbeat view.Recent industrial production data, combined with retail salesfigures, unit labor costs and a slowdown in the growth ofaverage earnings all are perceived as pointing to anapproaching economic rebound. And on a world-wide valuationbasis, British equities are considered inexpensive, comparedwith European and U.S. stocks.   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index, aftertrading as high as 2621.5, closed at a record 2617.2, up 8.4points. The previous closing high, set Wednesday, was 2608.8.The FT 30-share index rose 9.3 to 2042.6. Volume was 522.5million shares, compared with 631.2 million shares a dayearlier.   In Frankfurt, the DAX index finished at 1654.29, up 4.1points. Worries about wage increases damped any incentive totake prices higher. After the stock market closed, the GermanBundesbank announced as widely expected that, effectivetoday, it is lifting its discount rate to 7.5% from 6.5% andits Lombard rate to 9.25% from 9%. The decision to maintain atight monetary policy also restores a 1.75 percentage-pointgap between the discount rate, traditionally the floor forGerman money-market rates, and the Lombard rate, whichtraditionally acts as the ceiling for overnight-loan rates.The Bundesbank had held the discount rate down to helpeastern German banks cope with the transition to dailyrefinancing. Frankfurt stock prices had already adjusted toaccount for the central bank's increase in lending rates.   In addition to the wait for the Bundesbank's decision,stock traders were discouraged from buying by reports thatsome German union leaders were seeking 10% pay increases fortheir workers this year. This raised fears that theBundesbank might be forced to raise rates again.   Big bourses across Europe -- several were closed for aholiday -- shrugged off interest-rate actions, and equitiesrose overall. Amsterdam share prices were flat to slightlyhigher, as trading was barely affected by a 0.25percentage-point increase in official Dutch interest rates.In Zurich, stocks rose, despite a short-lived sell-off inresponse to the Swiss National Bank's decision to increaseits discount rate, which has almost no effect on monetarypolicy. The German central bank's announcement came in thelast hour of trading in Stockholm, which closed firmer,ignoring the Bundesbank move because investors are focusingon coming Swedish corporate earnings reports.   Stocks across Asia were mixed. The Sydney market nudgedhigher on weakerthan-expected national accounts data thatspurred hopes for an early easing in interest rates. Manila'sseven-session losing streak ended in a technical rally.   Among corporate developments, in London, Royal InsuranceHoldings rose 7 pence, or 1.7%, to 419 pence ($7.06), on abetter-than-expected earnings report. The insurer'sfirst-half pretax loss widened to #97 million ($163.5million) from #65 million a year earlier, owing to risingclaims and the recession. The latest deficit was slightlyless than previous market estimates of about #103 million.   In Zurich, Swiss Volksbank was unchanged at 1,335 Swissfrancs ($877.36). The commercial bank said it has uncoveredirregularities in the foreign-exchange department at itsBasel office. Volksbank said neither bank customers nor thebank itself were hurt by the case. The bank said two senioremployees were dismissed and a criminal complaint was filed.
