Since the end of April, Berlitz stock has risen 48%.Yesterday, it closed at 22, meaning that a share now sellsfor 36 times the past 12 months' per-share earnings for thelanguage-instruction company. That puts it in the priciest10% of all New York Stock Exchange stocks, according toFactSet Data Systems. Not bad for a company that went publiconly last December.</LP><TEXT>   In 1988, Britain's Maxwell Communication acquiredMacmillan, which had owned Berlitz since 1965. In December,Maxwell offered 44% of Berlitz shares to the public at 16 1/2each. The price lingered in that neighborhood for severalmonths, then shot upward.   A spokeswoman for Berlitz yesterday cited three reasonsfor the stock's strength: favorable reports by brokerageanalysts, increased interest in global businesses, and theopening up of Eastern Europe.   Gail Raiman, analyst with C.J. Lawrence, sees anotherreason. Investors were intrigued when Robert Maxwell,chairman of Maxwell Communication (and of Berlitz), saidrecently that he plans to sell $800 million of &quot;non-strategicbusiness assets.&quot; Some investors figured that this might meanBerlitz and that Mr. Maxwell might wangle an above-marketprice, at least for his own shares and possibly for the wholecompany.   In light of the recent run-up, however, even fans of thecompany are beginning to concede that the stock is pricey.   &quot;We still own some; obviously we still like it,&quot; saysRobert Buhrmann, analyst with Sun Bank Capital Management inOrlando, Fla. &quot;Nobody else has the international reach thatthey do, and nobody else can charge the premium price thatthey do.&quot; He says Berlitz has &quot;a defendable niche,&quot; and &quot;welike niche stocks.&quot;   Even so, Mr. Buhrmann says, &quot;I would not add {to holdings}at these prices.&quot; He suggests that long-term holders&quot;accumulate&quot; the stock on dips below 20 and &quot;be aggressive&quot;in buying on any declines below 18.   Sun Bank Capital owned 365,000 shares as of March 30,according to CDA Investment Technologies, which tracks moneymanagers' government filings. The firm expands or trims itscore holdings based on short-term price movements. Lately ithas been trimming its Berlitz holdings. &quot;But I certainlywouldn't sell all my position,&quot; he says. &quot;You know, reallygood businesses are hard to find.&quot;   Berlitz should benefit from the increasing unification ofEurope and the growing ties between the old West and Eastblocs. It caters to business people who want to learn (orbrush up on) a language before a trip or assignment abroad.About half of its business comes from Fortune 500 companies.For its intense, short-term courses, it generally chargeshigher prices than competing language schools.   More than 75% of its business comes from outside NorthAmerica: Berlitz is much more likely to teach a Japanesebusinessman English than to teach an American businessmanJapanese. Its revenue comes 40% from Europe, 27% from Asia,23% from North America and 9% from Latin America. For peopleapprehensive about the sluggish U.S. economy, that's a plus.   Analysts expect Berlitz to earn about 67 cents to 70 centsa share this year, and close to $1 a share next year. Thecompany will say only that it expects this year's earnings totop last year's 63 cents a share, but it doesn't quarrel withanalysts' estimates.   Reported earnings understate the cash flow, becausethere's about 50 cents a share in amortization of goodwill,mostly from the Maxwell acquisition of Macmillan. And debt --a $50 million bank loan from Societe Generale in France -- ismoderate.   Nevertheless, the stock is still priced at 22 times nextyear's earnings. The average Big Board stock sells for about16 times last year's earnings -- and even that multiple is abit above historic norms.   At Goldman Sachs, which handled the initial publicoffering of Berlitz shares, analyst Robert Adler ratesBerlitz &quot;attractive.&quot; But because the stock already has hithis target price of 22, he says: &quot;I guess I rate the stock anexcellent long-term hold, but I'd be less aggressive atcurrent levels.&quot;   The company projects that its sales will grow about 15% ayear for the next five years (10% volume increases and 5%price increases), with earnings growth of perhaps 17% a year(based on modest improvements in profit margins). That's nicegrowth. But it isn't the sort of scorching growth for whichinvestors usually pay fat earnings multiples.   ---   Berlitz International   (NYSE; Symbol: BTZ)                                                                                                          Business: Language instruction   Year ended Dec. 31, 1989:   Sales: $216.5 million   Net Income: $13.7 million; 63 cents a share                                                                                                          First quarter, March 31, 1990:   Per-share earnings: 15 cents vs. 17 cents                                                                                                          Average daily trading volume:   36,066 shares                                                                                                          Common shares outstanding: 19 million</TEXT></DOC>
