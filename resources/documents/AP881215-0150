The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which regulatesabout 4,400 of the nation's 14,000 commercial banks, issued a set ofguidelines for banks and government examiners to determine whether abank's safety is endangered by involvement in the buyouts, or LBOs.   Comptroller Robert L. Clarke, in a memo to all national banks,said LBOs are ``considerably more complex and characterized byhigher levels of risk than more traditional forms of commercial banklending.''   But he acknowledged that LBOs have become an important source ofincome for banks as their traditional source of income _straightforward loans to corporations _ becomes more scarce.   LBOs are ``a legitimate business activity, as long as a bank'sboard of directoers and management follow prudent banking principlesand guard against unnecessary credit and legal risks,'' Clarke said.   In an LBO, such as Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co.'s $25 billionpurchase of RJR Nabisco Inc., an investment group borrows heavily inorder to buy out stockholders and take over the company.   The company's new owners either cut costs or sell off pieces ofthe company to pay back the loans. Critics of the practice fear thehigh debt levels in an economic downturn would endanger both thecompany and the group or bank that lends the money.   In guidelines issued to bank examiners, the comptroller stresseddiversification. He said a bank should have policies in placeensuring it is not overly involved in LBOs, does not lend too muchto a single borrower and does not concentrate its lending to asingle industry.   Banks also should have policies curbing potential conflicts ofinterest in LBOs, to guard against getting sued by the losingparties in takeover battles.   ``These are fundamental elements of any sound credit process, butthey are especially important in view of the risk characteristics ofmany'' LBOs, the guidelines said.   The cautions apply equally to banks that originate the loans andthose that buy into the deals by participating through other,larger, banks, they said.   The comptroller began working on the LBO guidelines aftersurveying the practices of 11 large money center banks and fiveregional banks in late spring and early summer.   According to Loan Pricing Corp., a New York company that monitorslarge banks loans to corporations, banks have lent $70 billion inhighly leveraged transactions since mid-1987.   Earlier this week, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., whichinsures bank deposits up to $100,000, said a substantial butundetermined amount of bank profits this year are coming from LBOs.   Banks through the first nine months of this year reported recordprofits of $16.4 billion and likely will have earned more than $23billion by the end of the year, the FDIC said.</TEXT></DOC>
