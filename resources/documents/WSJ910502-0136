Three years ago, only 36% of members voted for the lasttrucking settlement, but it was declared ratified because itfailed to get the necessary two-thirds majority to reject thecontract.</LP><TEXT>   This time, the truck drivers and other industry workersvoted 61,903 to 29,305 for the pact. The settlement willboost employer costs by $2.50 an hour, or about 12%,according to R.V. Durham, a Teamsters vice president and headof its master freight negotiating team.   Mr. Durham is the leading candidate in the race for unionpresident, to be decided in a government-supervised electionin December.   The package raises hourly wages $1.40, or about 9.5%, overthe three years of the contract, including an increase of 50cents an hour retroactive to April 1. Mileage rates forlong-haul drivers are boosted by 3.5 cents a mile, or about9.5%.   While some members have said the pact isn't as generous asa previous Teamsters settlement with United Parcel ServiceInc., Mr. Durham said that because about half of the UPS workforce works only part-time, getting a lower wage scale, thenew trucking agreement actually is more favorable to moreunion members than the UPS pact.</TEXT></DOC>
