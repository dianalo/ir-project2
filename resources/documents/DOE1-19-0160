The study wasconducted using electron spin resonance (esr) and optical spectroscopytechniques at about 77K. The hydroxides of lithium, sodium and potassiumwere looked at briefly as these have been covered in previous work. Rubidiumand caesium hydroxides have been investigated in more detail, and resultspresented here clearly show that a second electron trapped centre existsfor gamma-irradiated Rb aqueous glasses. Results for irradiated CsOHaqueous glasses are less conclusive, but certainly show divergence fromthe pattern established in lithium, sodium and potassium systems. Othersystems studied are the aqueous hydroxide glasses of sodium, potassium,rubidium and caesium (by pulse-radiolysis) irradiated aqueous glassescontaining halide salts (by esr and optical spectroscopy), irradiatedaqueous hydroxide glasses of caesium or rubidium mixed with sodium orpotassium (esr spectroscopy), gamma-irradiated glasses of mixed ammonia-watersystems at 77K (esr and optical spectroscopy) and gamma irradiated KOHpellets at 77K (esr spectroscopy).</TEXT></DOC>
