USAir Group said Thursday its second-quarter earnings rose 9percent and Midway Airlines Inc. said its net income tumbled 48percent from a year earlier.   For the second quarter ended June 30, UAL had net income of $141million, or $6.52 per share, up from $124 million, or $5.77 ashare, for the same period a year ago. Revenue of the Chicago-basedcompany rose to $2.5 billion from $2.3 billion.   The company, which has been the object of heavy takeoverspeculation in the stock market during recent weeks, also announcedthat its board of directors amended UAL's ``poison pill''antitakeover plan to make it tougher for a hostile bidder to buythe company.   Delta's fourth-quarter profit was $190.8 million, or $3.87 ashare, up from $103.3 million, or $2.11 a share, in the same periodlast year. Revenue totaled $2.31 billion, up from $1.9 billion ayear ago.   USAir reported net earnings of $100.7 million, or $2.29 a sharein the second-quarter, up from $92.5 million, or $2.14 a share, inthe same 1988 period. Revenue rose 16 percent to $1.7 billion from$1.5 billion last year.   Midway Airlines' net earnings fell 48 percent to $5.1 million,or 46 cents a share, in the second quarter from $9.7 million, or 87cents a share, a year ago. Revenue rose to $126.5 million from$111.5 million.   UAL reported higher operating expenses and declines in bothrevenue passengers and revenue-passenger miles, resulting in a 1percent drop in operating earnings.   Spokesman Rob Doughty said he did not know how the crash lastweek of a United jetliner in Sioux City, Iowa, would affect UAL'sthird-quarter results. ``There would be expenses, of course, but wereally haven't seen an impact on revenue so far,'' he said.   UAL's original shareholder rights plan, adopted in 1986, grantedshareholders the right, in the event of a threatened takeover, topurchase for $185 one one-hundredth of a share of a new series ofjunior participating preferred stock and two shares of common stockfor each share of common stock they already owned. The amended planchanges the common-stock ratio to three for one.   Such plans typically are used to make a hostile takeoverprohibitively expensive by creating more stock for a suitor toacquire.   UAL's stock has risen sharply in the past month on takeoverspeculation. Doughty declined to comment on takeover rumors.   UAL reported a 71 percent drop in net income for the first sixmonths of 1989 to $206.5 million, or $9.55 a share, from $701million, or $19.12 a share, in the year-earlier period.   The 1988 results included a $549 million one-time gain fromUAL's sale of its Westin Hotel Co.   First-half revenue rose to $4.8 billion from $4.3 billion infirst-half 1988.   Delta Air Lines said the strike by Eastern Airlines employees,now in its fifth month, increased business for the Atlanta-basedcarrier and contributed to record fourth-quarter earnings.   ``Traffic in the last four months of the fiscal year wasinflated by a strike against a major Delta competitor, but trafficalso grew strongly in markets not directly affected by thestrike,'' said Thomas J. Roeck, Delta's senior vice president forfinance and chief financial officer.   Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport was Eastern's largesthub prior to the March 4 walkout by Machinists, pilots and flightattendants, and is the center of the Miami-based airline'srebuilding effort.   Eastern was virtually grounded during the early days of thestrike by its pilots, flight attendants and Machinists unions.   For its fiscal year ended June 30, Delta posted a profit of$460.9 million, or $9.37 a share, up 50 percent from $306.8million, or $6.30 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 17 percentto $8.1 billion from $6.9 billion in the previous year.   USAir, based in Arlington, Va., had first-half income of $116.2million, or $2.65 a share, up 58 percent from year-earlier resultsof $73.7 million, or $1.70 a share. First-half revenue rose to $3.2billion, up from $2.7 billion.   Strong traffic results by both USAir and Piedmont helped offsetsofter yields stemming promotional fares, such as its Kids Fly Freeprograms and reduced fares in the California markets, the companysaid.   USAir acquired Piedmont Aviation in 1987 and plans to merge withthe airline on Aug. 5.   For the first six months of the year, Chicago-based Midway saidits net income grew 83 percent to $8 million, or 72 cents a share,from $4.4 million, or 41 cents a share. Revenue was 21 percenthigher at $243.7 million, compared with $201.1 million in the 1988period.</TEXT></DOC>
