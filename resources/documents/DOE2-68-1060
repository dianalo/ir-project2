<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-68-1060 </DOCNO><TEXT>Two types of damage (cracking and pitting) have been observed on the Novafused-silica-glass final focusing lenses. Cracking occurred in the centerof the vacuum (tension) face of one lens. We believe the cracking wasa result of acoustic waves focusing radially on the axis of the lens,producing tensile stresses that exceeded the strength of the glass. Thistype of damage can result in catastrophic failure and in extensive damageto expensive equipment. This lens was removed immediately and pressuretested to failure. Failure occurred when a pressure difference of 150kPa was placed across the lens---which is only 50% higher than the pressuredifference at normal operating conditions. Pitting occurs because laserlight is diffracted and scattered around an apodized groove, concentratingin a annular region on the vacuum face. It also occurs at random locationswhen contaminants, adhering to the lens vacuum face, absorb laser light.In both cases, thermal stresses produce pitting; however, this pittingis not of structural concern because any flaws exceeding the fracturetoughness of the glass propagate toward the vacuum face where the highesttensile stresses in the lenses exist. 10 refs., 2 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
