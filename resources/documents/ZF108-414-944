said Sam Coleman, theLivermore, Calif., lab's storage group leader.andM;&quot;Large sites are forced to write their own algorithm, but in the last fewyears there has been a lot of interest prompted by the remarkable growth ofsupercomputers,&quot; he said.andM;CPU technology is advancing quickly, but little attention is being paid tostoring the massive amounts associated with supercomputing, Coleman said.andM;&quot;Three years ago, the national laboratories were the lunatic fringe, alwaysneeding faster and bigger machines,&quot; Coleman said.andP;  &quot;Now other sites havecaught up and have the same problems we do.&quot;andM;Last month the lab signed a licensing agreement for the storage system withGeneral Atomic's Distributed Computing Solutions (DISCOS) division in SanDiego.andP;  The commercial version of the product will be called Unitree.andM;The lab has spent the last six years developing a replacement storage system,Coleman said.andP;  The Livermore Integrated Network Computing System (LINCS) --the lab's name for the Unitree product -- is hierarchical, uses C and UNIXand stores data on disks and tapes, Coleman said.andM;&quot;Our goal is to be portable from one platform to another,&quot; Coleman said.andM;LINCS was developed on an Amdahl 5860, and General Atomics ported it to theVAX in less than two months.andM;Data not recently accessed is stored on disk.andP;  Newer data is on disks servedby automated loaders, which lets a user get the requested data in 30 seconds.andM;Data usually is first stored on disk, but extremely large files are stored ontape, Coleman said.andP;  Data on disks is stored on tape &quot;fairly quickly&quot; to actas a backup.andM;Once a file is stored on tape, the disk version can be destroyed, Colemansaid.andP;  Large files that are not accessed might be removed within a few hours,while a small file of a memo could stay on the disk for years, as long as itis accessed once a month.andP;  Data that is several years old is stored on tapein a vault, and an operator must load the tape manually.andM;Goal Is Fewer Tape LoadsandM;Users, located across the country, typically access 4,000 files a day, andthe goal is to have them call up only 400 files off tapes, Coleman said.andO;Before the optimization algorithm was in place, operators loaded 1,000 tapeseach day.andM;The lab has come a long way in 23 years.andP;  In 1967 it acquired an IBMCorp.-built optical storage system that never became a commercial success,and was supported only until 1979, Coleman said.andP;  The data was transferred to5,000 half-inch tapes, but data continued to accumulate.andM;By 1986 the lab had 50,000 tapes filling the vault.andM;The open computing portion of the lab has one Cray Y-MP, two X-MPs and twoCray-1Ss.andP;  The storage system handles 7 terabytes of data, 7 million filesand 500,000 directories, Coleman said.andM;Although the lab stores massive amounts of data, budget constraints preventresearchers from storing backup data off site.andP;  There are physical protectionand fire suppression systems, but &quot;if we had the resources, we'd makeduplicates&quot; of the tapes, Coleman said.andM;LINCS was developed for IBM 3480 tape cartridges, the Storage TechnologyCorp. automated library and IBM-compatible disks on the Amdahl.andP;  However,users can write software drivers to allow other storage devices to work withUnitree.andM;General Atomics markets an earlier-generation storage system developed at LosAlamos National Laboratory in Albuquerque, N.M., Coleman said.andP;  The systemworks well but is tailored for IBM systems only.andM;&quot;DISCOS was formed to find software like this developed by the government anduse it in commercial products,&quot; he said.andM;Both the company and the lab will continue developing the product, and thelab will run a system identical to what is shipped, he said.andM;Storage devices could be configured many ways, Coleman said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
