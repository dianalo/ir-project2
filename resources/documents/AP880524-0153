In a letter Monday to Edgar Bronfman, president of the WorldJewish Congress, Assistant Secretary of State Richard Williamsonsaid the ``anti-Semitic statement by the Syrian representative ...was an unaccaptable use of the (U.N.) Security Council as aplatform for spewing racism.''   Williamson was referring to a statement by Syrian AmbassadorFachi al-Masri on May 6 at the U.N. Security Council during adebate about an Israeli incursion into southern Lebanon.   Al-Masri said Israel's presence in south Lebanon is aimed atcreating ``a state of psychosis that will compel the inhabitants ofsouthern Lebanon to abandon their lands and property, thereby ...giving a free hand to the expansionist policy of the World JewishCongress, with Israel as its agent.''   The WJC, an international organization which defends the rightsof Jews and other minorities, wrote a protest letter to U.N.Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar expressing ``outrage atthis vile expression of anti-Semitism.''   Williamson assured Bronfman the United States would ``remainalert to the possibility of such statements in the future and,where appropriate, will respond accordingly.''   At last month's U.N. Human Rights Commission meeting in Geneva,the WJC demanded that Syria expel Alois Brunner, who was a seniorNazi officer in World War II and now lives in Damascus.</TEXT></DOC>
