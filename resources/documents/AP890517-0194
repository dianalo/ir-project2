TATRO</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The former chief army psychologist faulted thearmy on Wednesday for failing to develop specially trainedanti-riot forces to deal with the Palestinian uprising in theoccupied territories.   Reuven Gal, a reserve colonel who heads an independent militarystudy center, told reporters that despite its excellent combathistory the army was doing ``very poorly'' in coping with theviolence that has killed more than 480 Palestinians since Dec. 8,1987.   He said that in the 22 years since Israel seized the West Bankand Gaza Strip from Arab control, the army never viewed controllingthe territory as a prime mission and subsequently failed to developspecial units.   ``The mystery is how come after a year and a half of theintefadeh (uprising) they haven't caught up,'' Gal told agovernment-sponsored briefing.   ``The Israel Defense Forces are usually very quick to adapt tonew situations with new weapons and new tactics. (But) until nowthere is not a single base in the IDF where soldiers trainspecifically for riot control.''   Gal, who heads the Israel Institute for Military Studies inZichron Yaacov, said the army commanders resisted change becausethey were combat-oriented and did not want to turn the IDF into apolice force.   He said that because of the army's neither-nor way of handlingthe intefadeh, ``in the end they come up as both immoral andineffective at the same time.''   Gal, the army's chief psychologist from 1977-82, said policeduties also interfered with the motivation to be combat soldiers,especially in the regular army.   A U.S. State Department report on human rights criticized theIsraeli army's lack of training and experience in riot control,saying it contributed to a high number of human rights violations.   Col. Renaan Gissin, the army deputy spokesman, acknowledged thatthe army had created no special branch to deal with riot controland had no central base for preparing troops for duty in theoccupied lands.   But he said the army recently deployed three new companies ofborder police and three to four companies of mechanized infantrywho are specially trained to deal with civil unrest. A companycontains about 100 soldiers.   ``It took time, nearly a year, to develop and train them,''Gissin said in an interview.   He said the army now gives special orientation and training toall units that serve in occupied areas, and built models of WestBank streets for the units to practice.   The army, which maintained about 10,000 troops on average in theoccupied lands in 1988, was not able to develop a larger force forthe West Bank and Gaza because of ``budgetary restraints,'' Gissinsaid.   He listed the intefadeh as the army's third priority afterpreparing for all-out war and guarding against terror attacks.   The army has spent about $250 million on the uprising.</TEXT></DOC>
