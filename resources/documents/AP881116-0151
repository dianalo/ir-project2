Forstmann Little said in a brief statement that an investmentgroup headed by the firm had decided ``consistent with itsinvestment criteria, it will not submit a proposal.''   Its withdrawal from possible involvement in the battle forAtlanta-based RJR Nabisco leaves two enormous contenders, a groupconsisting of RJR Nabisco management, backed by the Wall Streetfirms Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and Salomon Brothers Inc., vs. theinvestment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co.   Both have offered more than $20 billion for RJR Nabisco, a makerof products ranging from Oreo cookies to Winston cigarettes. Most ofthat money would be borrowed and repaid via RJR Nabisco's earningsand the sale of some of its assets, an increasingly controversialtransaction known as a leveraged buyout.   Forstmann Little's withdrawal came three weeks after it heldtalks with the RJR Nabisco management group and considered joiningtheir bid for the company. It then assembled a rival groupconsisting of Procter andamp; Gamble Co., Ralston Purina Co., Castle andamp;Cooke Inc. and Goldman Sachs andamp; Co.   The RJR Nabisco management group stunned the financial world latelast month by disclosing its intention to acquire the company in aleveraged buyout. The size, complexity and enormous debt load ofsuch a transaction have raised concerns about the use of borrowedmoney to finance corporate takeovers.</TEXT></DOC>
