(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Lamaura Data DictionaryandM;dBase programmers are blessed with a wide array of third party utilities.andP;  Anew entrant into the vast dBase add-on market is the Lamaura Data Dictionary.andO;The package provides an interactive environment for building a datadictionary -- the array of database file structures, indexes, relations andfilters that form the bedrock of any dBase application.andM;Although you don't need the Lamaura Data Dictionary to build thesestructures, the authors contend that by using their package, you'll avoidmany of the common pitfalls of bad database design.andM;As the manual correctly argues, a poorly designed database will haunt usersand developers throughout the life of an application.andP;  Among the problemscaused by poor design are slow execution speed, wasted disk space and, worstof all, meaningless or misleading data.andM;Unfortunately, Lamaura doesn't peform database design nor does itautomatically correct design flaws.andP;  It simply provides a structured designenvironment in which you are more likely to catch out any errors on your own.andM;It achieves this primarily by allowing you to enter, view and print much moreinformation about your fields that dBase does.andP;  Among the extra fieldattributes Lamaura maintains are a long description, a picture clause, adefault and a validity testing expression.andM;Lamaura also allows you to view all the indexes for a particular table atonce, set up filter and relation expressions and create 'virtual fields',which are calculated from other fields but not physically stored in thedatabase.andP;  In addition, Lamaura imports and exports data and index files sothat you don't have to perform double entry.andM;On the downside, Lamaura isn't very user friendly.andP;  Key assignments arenon-standard and aren't displayed on the screen.andP;  Lamaura does provide aQuick Guide, but a keyboard template would be more helpful.andM;Probably the most irritating aspect of Lamaura is its security system.andP;  Inorder to stop 'Junior and Senior Programmers' from wreaking havoc with thedata dictionary (a prospect I wouldn't find particularly worrying), thepackage is split into a user program and a supervisor program.andM;The former allows you to create tables, indexes, filters and relations.andP;  Thelatter lets you print documentation, perform imports and exports andreconfigure the system.andP;  It's often necessary to exit one program and go intothe other during a single Lamaura session.andM;To add to the misery, user names can only be enterred by means of a DOSenvironment variable.andP;  All of this might work on a LAN, but it's a pain on astand alone machine.andP;  One can only hope that the authors will make securityboth optional and less onerous in future releases.andM;A final criticism is that Lamaura simply doesn't really do all that much.andO;Competing packages such as UI Programmer or FoxView offer most of Lamaura'sdata dictionary functions and they also provide screen painters, applicationsgenerators and template languages.andP;  Although Lamaura plans to offer some ofthese functions in separate packages, both of the competing products arebetter implemented.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
