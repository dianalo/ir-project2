It summarizes the informationfrom a project study given under contract by Nagra. The report shouldorient a broader public about the possible construction of such intermediateand final repositories. The work presented here refers to radioactivewastes which need an extremely long isolation time. Important informationfrom a separate study concerning different aspects of the drilling ofdeep boreholes, has been integrated into the present report.</TEXT></DOC>
