WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   Jesse Jackson said Monday he expects Democratic leaders toembrace him as the nominee if he wins the most pre-conventiondelegates because ``I would have earned it from the people.''Democrat Richard Gephardt ended his candidacy, and Republicanex-candidate Jack Kemp climbed on George Bush's bandwagon.   As Democratic leaders wrestled with the implications ofJackson's overwhelming weekend victory in Michigan, Gephardt leftthe race for the Democratic presidential nomination at a CapitolHill news conference.   ``It's been said the opera isn't over until the fat ladysings,'' Gephardt said. ``Last Saturday in Michigan I think I heardher walking to the microphone.''   ABC News, meanwhile, reported that Republican Bob Dole was setto drop out Tuesday. The report cited campaign sources, and couldnot be immediately confirmed. Dole has acknowledged Bush is thealmost certain nominee, and had been expected to withdraw soon.   One consequence of Gephardt's withdrawal was to edge Jacksonahead of Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis in the AP delegatecount by one slim vote.   Most of Gephardt's delegates were shifted into the uncommittedcategory with his withdrawal. But Missouri party rules mandate thatthe at-large and public official delegates are redivided among theactive candidates when a contender drops out. That gave Jackson atleast six more delegates.   Jackson now has 606.55, Dukakis 605.55, Tennessee Sen. AlbertGore Jr. 362.8, Sen. Paul Simon 168.5 and uncommitted 515.6,according to the AP count.   Gephardt was pushed to withdraw by a third-place finish inMichigan's caucuses, far short of the ``Michigan miracle'' hesought to revive a candidacy that blossomed in Iowa's lead-offcaucuses but was trampled in the South.   Jackson and Dukakis both campaigned in Connecticut on the eve ofits primary. Gore campaigned in New York and was joining Jacksonand Simon at a debate Monday night.   Dukakis, the governor of Massachusetts, was hoping his neighborstate would provide a victory sufficient to ease the pain of hisloss to Jackson in Michigan _ a loss that raised questions abouthis candidacy and his abilities as a campaigner.   At a junior high school in East Hartford, a black student askedDukakis why she should vote for him over Jackson.   ``I am not running against him and he is not running against me;we are running for the presidency,'' Dukakis responded, his answerrunning so long that he concluded by apologizing.   ``I'm sorry I'm making a speech instead of answering yourquestion,'' he said. ``I hope I've persuaded you. I don't know.''   Dukakis borrowed a favorite Jackson subject, urging the studentsto reject drugs. His wife Kitty told of her secret 26-yearamphetamine addiction.   The governor was peppered with questions about Jackson butdeclined to outline any differences between himself and Jackson``because I've never done that.''   ``I don't think the American people are particularly interestedin what I think of the other candidates and what they think ofme,'' Dukakis said.   GOP front-runner Bush, confident of winning in Connecticut, thestate he grew up in, began a three-day campaign swing throughWisconsin, the next battleground with primaries next week. Polls inboth states put Bush decisively ahead.   ``One of the best things that happened to me was getting mybrains kicked out in Iowa,'' Bush said. ``Everybody had me dead andburied ... So people say now things are going pretty well for you,and they are.''   Kemp, the New York congressman who abandoned his conservativecandidacy two weeks ago, joined Bush in Milwaukee to offer anendorsement.   ``George Bush is going to be the nominee of the Republican Partyand has earned that nomination,'' Kemp said. ``The time has comefor all Republicans to unite behind this man who has been a fineand loyal vice president, and to help him be the next president ofthe United States.''   Bush's remaining two rivals behaved as though their races wereover, even though they kept their candidacies alive.   Dole, all but conceding the nomination to Bush, spoke tocampaign workers in Washington in what sounded like a last hurrah _though aides said he wasn't ready to withdraw.   He said the Republcan Party ``must cast off the restrictions ofprivilege and class. We must offer help to those who need it. Wemust support and defend civil rights.''   Former television evangelist Pat Robertson, with only 17delegates to show for a campaign that has spent $25 million, tookthe week off.   Gore, the Tennessee Democrat, spoke at a congressional hearingin New York City on homelessness and met privately with Mayor EdKoch. Later he criticized Secretary of State George Shultz formeeting with ``surrogates'' of the Palestine LiberationOrganization.   Gore said in a letter to Shultz he had ``damaged the essentialbond of confidence between America and the people of Israel.''   Jackson campaigned in Connecticut and considered the possibilityother Democrats were confronting _ that he could be the candidatewith the most delegate votes and popular votes by the end of theprimary season in June.   ``If by the end of California we have the most popular votes,the most delegate votes, becoming the nominee is logical andproper,'' Jackson said on ABC-TV. ``If I win the nomination fromthe people, I expect the party to embrace me, and to embrace thoseprinciples.''   He questioned the notion that party leaders, believing he cannotwin in the general election, might ignore his strength at theconvention and give the nomination to another Democrat.   ``They would not have given me the nomination, I would haveearned it from the people,'' he said. ``There is no small group, noelectoral college that can give or take your nomination. If so, whyeven have a primary. ... Let the people speak.''   Democratic Chairman Paul Kirk said, ``I wouldn't be a party'' toa stop-Jackson movement   ``I can't imagine that if he runs through the process and comesout on top, they could take it away from him,'' Kirk said. ``Iwould refuse to be part of that.'''   Democratic House Speaker Jim Wright credited Jackson withdemonstrating ``remarkable support and surprising appeal. He issaying things people thirst to hear.''</TEXT></DOC>
