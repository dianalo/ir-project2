The memo, marked ``urgent'' and ``confidential,'' was sent toNoriega on April 1 by Leo Wanta, president of AmeriChina GlobalManagement Group Inc., an arms exporting firm based in Appleton,Wis.   The document offered fresh evidence of Noriega's intention toride out Panama's prolonged political crisis partly with help of alarge infusion of foreign weapons. A Defense Forces defector saidlast month he had helped fly to Panama 94,000 pounds of weaponsfrom Cuba.   In what appeared to be a major security breach aimed at blockingthe purchase by his boss, the unidentified officer leaked the memoto a Panamanian opposition leader. The memo was turned over to TheAssociated Press on condition the leader be identified neither byname nor location.   Wanta told Noriega in the memo that the supplier of the weaponshad advised that ``they are ready to finalize the delivery'' of theBrowning 9mm semi-automatic pistols made in Belgium.   The schedule called for the delivery of 5,000 pistolsimmediately and 2,000 per month thereafter until ``all units aredelivered.''   The memo did not specify how many weapons were to be sent alltold. But a previous memo by Wanta, obtained last month by the AP,said the purchase involved 30,000 pistols, including the 5,000 tobe sent immediately. The list price is $398 each.   The earlier memo was given to the AP by Panamanian AmbassadorJuan B. Sosa. Wanta had sent a telecopy of the memo to Sosa,unaware that the envoy had broken with Noriega and continues toregard ousted President Eric Arturo Delvalle as the country'sconstitutional leader. Sosa has refused to relinquish the embassyto a replacement envoy named by the new government in Panama.   Wanta sent the April 1 memo directly to Noriega, bypassing theembassy here. A stamp in the upper left hand corner of thecommunication said it was received by the Panamanian Defense Forceson April 5.   The pistols are manufactured by Fabrique Nationale, S.A., ofBelgium and are to be delivered from that country to Panama,according to the memo. The State Department raised the issue latelast month with the Belgian firm, which said that it had not hadcontact with anyone from AmeriChina, a U.S. official said.   The government cannot legally block the sale because the weaponsare not of American origin. The U.S. official, insisting onanonymity, said AmeriChina has not registered with the U.S.government, a requirement he said applies to all American armsdealers.   Wanta could not be reached for comment. The company phone numberthat appeared on the first memo was deleted from the second memo.The phone has been ``temporarily disconnected,'' according to arecorded announcement. The only address listed is a post office box.</TEXT></DOC>
