The powerabsorption is evaluated in the framework of the relativistic linear theory,using a suitable model electron distribution to describe the lower hybridsustained plasma; the driven current is computed by means of the adjointmethod. Top and equatorial launch have been explored for a wide rangeof plasma parameters and propagation angles. A favorable scaling of thedriven current with the magnetic field is found with a proper choiceof launching conditions. The results are interpreted in terms of single-particleefficiencies for absorption and current drive, location of resonant regionsin momentum and physical space, and characteristics of the ray trajectories.</TEXT></DOC>
