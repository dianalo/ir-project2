More      particularly, the present invention relates to an ionomer composition      having an excellent antistatic property and an excellent heat moldability.      Furthermore, the present invention relates to uses of this ionomer      composition as an antistatic agent and an antistatic resin composition. </PAR><PAR>  (2) Description of the Prior Art </PAR><PAR>  In general, molded articles of thermoplastic polymers are readily charged      with static electricity, and it is well-known that various troubles are      caused by charging with static electricity while these molded articles are      used or processed. Various methods have been proposed and practised as the      antistatic method for these molded articles. However, these methods are      defective in some points or other. For example, the method comprising      kneading an antistatic agent into a resin composition, which is generally      adopted, is defective in that the surface is made sticky or stained by      bleeding of the antistatic agent, the change of the electroconductivity by      external conditions is large and the attained antistatic effect is not      durable. Moreover, the method comprising adding an electroconductive      filler such as electroconductive carbon is defective in that no stable      antistatic effect can be attained unless the electroconductive filler is      added in a large amount, the obtained molded article therefore becomes      opaque, and the filler falls from the surface of the molded article to      cause contamination. Furthermore, there is known a method in which the      surface of a molded article is covered with an electroconductive material      such as a metal or a metal oxide by coating or vacuum deposition. However,      this method is defective in that the method can be applied only to a      molded article having a simple shape, the manufacturing cost increases and      the molded article becomes opaque. </PAR><PAR>  As the means for obviating these defects, there has already been proposed a      method in which an antistatic property is given to a polymer per se. For      examples, Japanese Unexamined Patent Application No. 60-240704 discloses      an electroconductive resin comprising an ionomer formed by neutralizing an      ethylene/unsaturated carboxylic acid copolymer with an alkali metal      selected from the group consisting of Na, K, Rb and Cs, wherein the amount      of the alkali metal is at least 1.3 millimoles per gram of the resin. When      we examined this proposal, it was found that although the above-mentioned      defects of the conventional techniques can be overcome by this proposal,      the proposal involves the following problems. Namely, in order to obtain a      sufficient antistatic effect, it is necessary that the alkali metal should      be contained in an amount of at least 1.5 millimoles per gram of the      resin, and therefore, the moisture-absorbing property of the ionomer      increases and a trouble of foaming is often caused at the molding step.      Furthermore, since the alkali metal is contained at a high concentration,      it is inevitably necessary that the content of the unsaturated carboxylic      acid in the ethylene/unsaturated carboxylic acid copolymer should be      increased, and this increase of the content of the unsaturated carboxylic      acid results in lowering of the melting point of the ionomer and      degradation of the heat resistance and the application field is limited.      Moreover, the manufacturing cost of such a copolymer having a high      unsaturated carboxylic acid content is large. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  We made research with a view to overcoming the defects and problems of the      above-mentioned ionomer, and as the result, it was found that if an      ionomer composition comprising at least two specific ionomers is used, a      sufficient antistatic effect can be attained even with a reduced amount of      an alkali metal. We have now completed the present invention based on this      finding. </PAR><PAR>  It is therefore a primary object of the present invention to provide an      ionomer in which the moisture absorbing property is reduced as compared      with that of the conventional ionomer if the antistatic property is at the      same level, and therefore, the foaming tendency at the molding step is      moderated. </PAR><PAR>  Another object of the present invention is to provide an ionomer for which      an ethylene/unsaturated carboxylic acid copolymer having a lower      unsaturated carboxylic acid content can be used, and which has an improved      heat resistance if an antistatic effect is at the same level and which is      available at a smaller cost. </PAR><PAR>  Still another object of the present invention is to provide a composition      having an improved antistatic property, which comprises an ionomer as      mentioned above and other thermoplastic polymer. </PAR><PAR>  More specifically, in accordance with one fundamental aspect of the present      invention, there is provided an ionomer composition comprising an      ethylene/unsaturated carboxylic acid copolymer which is at least partially      neutralized with at least one alkali metal selected from the group      consisting of potassium, rubidium and cesium, wherein the      ethylene/unsaturated carboxylic acid copolymer is a blend comprising (A)      an ethylene/unsaturated carboxylic acid copolymer having an unsaturated      carboxylic acid content of 6 to 15 mole % and (B) an ethylene/unsaturated      carboxylic acid copolymer having an unsaturated carboxylic acid content of      0.5 to 5 mole % at an (A)/(B) weight ratio of from 10/90 to 80/20, and the      alkali metal is present in an amount at least 0.4 millimole but smaller      than 1.3 millimoles per gram of the ionomer composition. </PAR><PAR>  In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, there is      provided an antistatic agent comprising the above-mentioned ionomer      composition. </PAR><PAR>  In accordance with still another aspect of the present invention, there is      provided an antistatic resin composition comprising (I) the      above-mentioned ionomer composition and (II) a thermoplastic polymer as a      (I)/(II) weight ratio of from 5/95 to 99/1. </PAR></BSUM><DETD> <PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </PAC><PAR>  The ionomer composition of the present invention consists of a blend      comprising at least two ionomers. Not only a binary polymer comprising      ethylene and an unsaturated caroboxylic acid but also a multi-component      polymer comprising other unsaturated carboxylic acid ester or vinyl ester      as a comonomer in addition to the above-mentioned two components can be      used as the ethylene/unsaturated carboxylic acid copolymer as the base of      each ionomer. </PAR><PAR>  .alpha.,.beta.-unsaturated carboxylic acids having 3 to 8 carbon atoms are      preferably used as the unsaturated carboxylic acid. For example, there can      be mentioned acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, maleic anhydride and      monoethyl maleate. As the unsaturated carboxylic acid ester to be used as      the third component of the copolymer, there can be mentioned esters of the      above-mentioned .alpha.,.beta.-unsaturated carboxylic acids with alcohols      having 1 to 12 carbon atoms. For example, there can be used methyl, ethyl,      isopropyl, n-propyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, tert-butyl and 2-ethylhexyl      esters. As the vinyl ester, there can be mentioned, for example, vinyl      acetate and vinyl propionate. </PAR><PAR>  The ionomer used in the present invention is formed by neutralizing      partially or completely the unsaturated carboxylic acid component of the      above-mentioned ethylene/unsaturated carboxylic acid copolymer as the base      with at least one alkali metal selected from the group consisting of      potassium, rubidium and cesium. This ionomer is schematically represented      by the following formula:      ##STR1##      wherein R.sub.1, R.sub.2, R.sub.3 and R.sub.4 each represent hydrogen      atom, an alkyl group or other substituent, M represents an alkali metal, R      represents a comonomer component which can be contained if desired, and a,      b, c and d represent molar fractions satisfying requirement of aandplus;bandplus;candplus;dandequals;1,      aandgt;0, b.gtoreq.0, candgt;0 and d.gtoreq.0. </PAR><PAR>  In the present invention, at least two kinds of such ionomers, and the      blend is characterized in that at least two ionomers differ in the      unsaturated carboxylic acid content in the ethylene/unsaturated carboxylic      acid copolymer. Namely, at least two ionomers differ in the value of (aandplus;b)      in the above-mentioned formula. </PAR><PAR>  In order to enjoy a highest effect by blending, it is preferred that the      difference of the unsaturated carboxylic acid content between ionomers      differing in the unsaturated uncarboxylic acid content be at least 2 mole      %, especially at least 4 mole %, particularly especially at least 5 mole      %. In order to attain a good antistatic property, it is preferred that the      unsaturated carboxylic acid content of the ionomer having a higher      unsaturated carboxylic acid content be at least 6 mole % andlsqb;(bandplus;c) in the      above formula be at least 0.06andrsqb;, especially at least 7 mole %. However, if      the content of the unsaturated carboxylic acid is too high, the      water-absorbing property and moisture-absorbing property become large and      the manufacturing cost increases. Accordingly, a copolymer having an      unsaturated carboxylic acid content not higher than about 15 mole % is      preferably used. </PAR><PAR>  In order to attain a high antistatic property in the blend and reduce the      moisture-absorbing property, it is preferred that the unsaturated      carboxylic acid content of the copolymer having a lower unsaturated      carboxylic acid content be not higher than 5 mole %, especially not higher      than 3.5 mole %, particularly especially not higher than 2.8 mole %.      However, if a copolymer having too low an unsaturated carboxylic acid      content is used, excellent characteristics of the ionomer such as the      transparency and toughness are degraded. Accordingly, it is preferred that      a copolymer having an unsaturated carboxylic acid content of at least 0.5      mole %, especially at least 0.8 mole %, be used. </PAR><PAR>  The ionomer composition of the present invention is a blend comprising at      least two kinds of ionomers. Of course, the composition may contain three      or more of ionomers. In case of a blend comprising at least three      ionomers, at least two ionomers of these ionomers should differ in the      unsaturated carboxylic acid content in the ethylene/unsaturated carboxylic      acid copolymer. For example, each of the ionomer having a higher      unsaturated carboxylic acid content and the ionomer having a lower      unsaturated carboxylic acid content may comprise at least two kinds of      ionomers. </PAR><PAR>  Ionomers differing in the melt flow rate can be used according to the      intended use. For example, ionomers having a melt flow rate of 0.05 to      1000 g/10 min as measured at 190.degree. C. under a load of 2160 g can be      used. </PAR><PAR>  In the ionomer composition of the present invention, the difference between      the unsaturated carboxylic acid content of the ionomer having a higher      unsaturated carboxylic acid content and the unsaturated carboxylic acid      content of the ionomer having a lower unsaturated carboxylic acid content      is preferably at least 2 mole %. In case of a blend comprising at least      three ionomers, the difference between the highest unsaturated carboxylic      acid content and the lowest unsaturated carboxylic acid content is      preferably at least 2 mole %. Namely, the blend preferably comprises at      least two ionomers, between which the difference of the unsaturated      carboxylic acid content in the ethylene/unsaturated carboxylic acid      copolymer is at least 2 mole %, but an ionomer having an unsaturated      carboxylic acid content intermediate between the high and low contents can      be further incorporated into the blend, so far as the performances of the      ionomer composition are not degraded. However, incorporation of an ionomer      having an intermediate unsaturated carboxylic acid content often results      in an adverse effect on the antistatic performance. </PAR><PAR>  Other monomer to be included into the base copolymer, such as an      unsaturated carboxylic acid ester or a vinyl ester, can be incorporated in      an amount of up to about 20 mole % in the ionomer. </PAR><PAR>  The alkali metal in the ionomer in the composition of the present invention      is selected from the group consisting of the present invention is selected      from the group consisting of potassium, rubidium and cesium. Among these      alkali metals, potassium is especially preferably used because it is cheap      and easily available. </PAR><PAR>  The content of the alkali metal differs to some extent according to the      kind of the ionomer to be blended. However, if the alkali metal content in      the ionomer composition is not lower than 0.4 millimole per gram of the      composition, especially not lower than 0.7 millimole per gram of the      composition, a good antistatic property can be attained. </PAR><PAR>  A higher alkali metal content is preferable from the viewpoint of the      antistatic property. However, if the alkali metal content is too high, the      moisture-absorbing property increases and troubles are sometimes caused at      the molding step. If the alkali metal content is maintained at a level not      higher than 1.3 millimoles per gram of the composition, preferably not      higher than 1.2 millimoles per gram of the composition, the      moisture-absorbing property is drastically lowered and a sufficient      antistatic property can be attained. </PAR><PAR>  A small amount of other metal ion, for example, zinc, lithium, magnesium or      sodium, may be contained in the ionomer composition of the present      invention. However, most of them tend to exert an adverse function of      degrading the antistatic property or increasing the moisture-absorbing      property, and in view of the object of the present invention, that is, the      reduction of the alkali metal content, it is preferred that the content of      the above-mentioned metal be controlled to a low level, and it is      generally preferred that such metal should not be contained. In the case      where other alkali metal such as litium or sodium is contained, the total      content of the alkali metals should be controlled to a lever not higher      than 1.5 millimoles per gram of the composition, preferably lower than 1.3      millimoles per gram of the composition. It is preferred that the content      of a divalent metal such as zinc, magnesium or calcium be controlled to a      level not higher than 0.2 millimole per gram of the composition. </PAR><PAR>  The following processes can be adopted for the preparation of the ionomer      composition of the present invention. </PAR><PAR>  (1) A process in which ionization is effected while or after      ethylene/unsaturated carboxylic acid ester copolymers differing in the      unsaturated carboxylic acid copolymer content are blended. </PAR><PAR>  (2) A process in which cosaponification is effected while or after      ethylene/unsaturated carboxylic acid copolymers differing in the      unsaturated carboxylic acid content are blended. </PAR><PAR>  (3) A process in which ethylene/unsaturated carboxylic acid copolymers or      ethylene/unsaturated carboxylic acid ester copolymers are independently      converted to ionomers in advance and the ionomers are blended. </PAR><PAR>  (4) A process in which one copolymer is converted to an ionomer and the      ionomer is melt-mixed with the other ethylene/unsaturated carboxylic acid      polymer as the base polymer. </PAR><PAR>  The ethylene/unsaturated carboxylic acid copolymer and ethylene/unsaturated      carboxylic acid ester copolymer used as the starting materials in the      above-mentioned processes can be prepared by radical copolymerization      under high-pressure and high-temperature conditions. As the known means      for forming an ionomer, there can be mentioned a process in which an      ethylene/unsaturated carboxylic acid copolymer is partially or completely      neutralized in the melted state or in the state dissolved or suspended in      a medium such as water with a hydroxide, oxide, carbonate, bicarbonate,      acetate or alkoxide of an alkali metal, and a process in which an      ethylene/unsaturated carboxylic acid copolymer is saponified in the      presence of an alkali metal ion, but a process in which an      ethylene/unsaturated carboxylic acid copolymer is melt-kneaded with an      alkali metal compound is most convenient and is advantageous from the      economical viewpoint. </PAR><PAR>  in view of the balance between the high antistatic performance and the low      water-absorbing and moisture-absorbing properties, the blend ratio in the      ionomer composition is determined so that the amount of the ionomer having      a higher unsaturated carboxylic acid content is 10 to 80 parts by weight,      preferably 15 to 60 parts by weight, and the amount of the ionomer having      a lower unsaturated carboxylic acid content is 90 to 20 parts by weight,      preferably 85 to 40 parts by weight. </PAR><PAR>  The ionomer composition of the present invention can be used for various      purposes directly or after optional additives such as an antioxidant, a      weathering stabilizer, a lubricant, a slip agent, a pigment, a dye, a      crosslinking agent, a foaming agent and a tackifier resin are added      according to need. For example, the ionomer composition can be used for a      packaging film, a mat, a container, a wall paper sheet, a battery      separator and the like. Furthermore, the ionomer composition can be used      in the form of a laminate with other thermoplastic resin, a paper sheet or      a metal. Moreover, the ionomer composition can be used in the form of an      aqueous dispersion as an electroconductive coating agent. </PAR><PAR>  The ionomer composition of the present invention can be used for an      antistatic agent, and the ionomer composition can be modified by blending      it with other thermoplastic polymer. Moreover, the ionomer composition can      be incorporated into other thermoplastic polymer for imparting an      antistatic property to the thermoplastic polymer. As the thermoplastic      polymer, there can be mentioned polyolefin resins such as high pressure      method polyethylene, linear low density polyethylene, medium density      polyethylene, high density polyethyllene, polypropylene, poly-1-butene,      poly-4-methyl-1-pentene, an ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymer and an      ethylene/unsaturated carboxylic ester copolymer, styrene polymers such as      polystyrene, an AS resin, an ABS resin, a styrene/butadiene block      copolymer and hydrogenation products thereof, poly amides such as nylon 6,      nylon 66, nylon 12 and amorphous nylon, polyesters such as polyethylene      terephthalate and polybutylene terephthalate, and polycarbonates,      polyactals, polyphenylene ethers, acrylic resins, olefin elastomers,      polyester elastomers and polyvinyl chloride. The mixing ratio is changed      more or less according to the intended use, but in general, the ionomer      composition and the thermoplastic resin are mixed at such a mixing ratio      that the amount of the ionomer composition is 5 to 99 parts by weight,      preferably 10 to 99 parts by weight, and the amount of the thermoplastic      resin is 95 to 1 parts by weight, preferably 90 to 1 parts by weight. Of      course, for preparing this composition, there can be adopted not only a      process in which the ionomer composition prepared in advance is mixed with      the thermoplastic resin, but also a process in which a composition of base      polymers as starting materials of the ionomer composition are mixed with      the thermoplastic resin then, the base polymers are converted to ionomers. </PAR><PAR>  According to the present invention, a molded article having an excellent      antistatic property, in which the defects of the conventional      electroconductive resins are overcome, can be provided. Namely, the      antistatic effect is durable and the reduction of the antistatic effect      with the lapse of time is not caused. Moreover, the antistatic effect is      not degraded even on contact with water or the like and is not      substantially influenced by moisture. </PAR><PAR>  As compared with the heretofore proposed electroconductive ionomers      containing an alkali metal at a high concentration, an antistatic effect      can be attained at the same level in the ionomer composition of the      present invention even at a much lower alkali metal content. Accordingly,      the moisture-absorbing property and water-absorbing property can be      controlled at very low levels, and therefore, foaming is hardly and      molding can be easily accomplished. Furthermore, since the heat resistance      is good, the limitation of application fields is moderated. Moreover, the      ionomer composition is advantageous in that it can be manufactured at a      low cost. </PAR><PAR>  Still further, by incorporating the ionomer composition of the present      invention in other thermoplastic polymer, an excellent antistatic effect      can be imparted to the thermoplastic polymer. </PAR><PAR>  The present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the      following examples that by no means limit the scope of the invention. </PAR><PAR>  The physical properties of thermoplastic resins used as the starting      material in the following examples and the obtained resin compositions      were determined according to the following methods. </PAR><PAC>  Thermoplastic Resins Used </PAC><PAL>  (1) Acid Copolymers (Ethylene/Methacrylic Acid Random Copolymers) </PAL><TBL>  ______________________________________                                                                       MFR                                              Acid Copolymer                                                                             Methacrylic Acid Content                                                                         (190.degree.

After the acid copolymers were      fused, powdery potassium carbonate was added in an amount shown in Table 1      and kneading was carried out at the same temperature and same rotation      number. Simultaneously with the addition of potassium carbonate,      ionization reaction was caused and carbon dioxide gas and water were      formed by the reaction. The resin in the laboratory plastomill was foamed      and the kneading torque increased. When 6 minutes has passed from the      point of the addition of potassium carbonate, foaming was stopped, and      when 7 minutes had passed from the point of the addition of potassium      carbonate, the kneading torque became equibriated. The ionization reaction      was completed in 10 minutes. </PAR><PAR>  The formed potassium ionomer was taken out from the laboratory plastomill,      heat-pressed at 160.degree. C. under a pressure of 50 kg/cm.sup.2 and      cooled by a cold press at 20.degree. C. under a pressure of 50 kg/cm.sup.2      to obtain a sample sheet having a thickness of 1 mm. The sample sheet was      semitransparent or transparent and did not contain foams at all. </PAR><PAR>  The obtained press sheet was allowed to stand still in air at a temperature      of about 25.degree. C. and a relative humidity of 60 to 70% for 7 days,      and the surface resistivity and frictional chargeability were measured. It      was found that the surface resistivity was 10.sup.7 to 10.sup.12 .OMEGA.      and no static electricity was generated by the friction in any sample at      all. </PAR><PAR>  The sheet was allowed to stand still in an atmosphere maintained at a      temperature of 20.degree. to 27.degree. C. and a relative humidity of 60      to 70% for 7 days, and the moisture-absorbing property was measured.      Furthermore, the sample was immersed in warm water at 50.degree. C. for 1      hour, and the water absorption was determined. The obtained results are      shown in Table 1. </PAR><PAC>  COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 1 THROUGH 10 </PAC><PAR>  Potassium ionomers composed of one acid copolymer were prepared in the same      manner as described in Examples 1 through 4 except that copolymers Nos. 1      through 7 were singly used independently. </PAR><PAR>  Press sheets having a thickness of 1 mm were prepared from these potassium      ionomers in the same manner as described in Examples 1 through 4. In case      of the potassium ionomer having a potassium ion concentration higher than      1.3 millimoles per gram of the resin, foaming was caused by evaporation of      water absorbed at the heat pressing step, and with respect to the sheet      obtained by repeating heat pressing at least two times, the surface      resistivity, moisture-absorbing property and water-absorbing property were      determined in the same manner as described in Examples 1 through 4. In      case of each of the ionomers having a potassium ion concentration higher      than 1.2 millimoles per gram of the resin, the surface resistivity was      lower than 10.sup.12 .OMEGA., and charging was not caused by the friction,      but the moisture-absorbing property and water-absorbing property were      higher than those of the antistatic ionomers obtained in Examples 1      through 4. In each of the potassium ionomers having an ion concentration      lower than 1.2 millimoles per gram of the resin, the surface resistivity      was higher than 10.sup.12 .OMEGA. and charging was caused by the friction.

Each      sample showed a surface resistivity much higher than 10.sup.12 .OMEGA.      even though the metal salt content exceeded 1.3 millimoles per gram of the      resin, and each sample was readily charged by the friction.

Ionization was carried out at a resin temperature of 240.degree.      C. and an extrusion rate of 15 kg/hr to obtain a pellet of a potassium ion      ionomer. This ionomer was formed into a film having a thickness of 100      .mu.m at a resin temperature of 200.degree. to 230.degree. C. by an      inflation film-forming machine having a screw diameter of 30 mm. Foaming      was not caused at the film-forming step, and the film-forming operation      could be performed easily and smoothly. Generation of static electricity,      generally observed at the step of forming a low density polyethylene film,      was not caused at all. Just after the preparation of the film and after 4      days' standing in an atmosphere maintained at a temperature of 25.degree.      C. and a relative humidity of 60%, the surface resistivity and charging by      the friction were determined. In each case, the resistivity was low and      charging was not caused.
