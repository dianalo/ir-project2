From1 to 5 g of total liposomal lipid 500 ml (NaCl, 0,9%) were co-injectedwith 500 {mu}Ci of 111-Indium labelled liposomes for 5 hours to six patients.The biodistribution was investigated by external counting (dynamic study)and scan imaging. No adverse effect was observed during the whole study.Accumulation is significant in the reticulo-endothelial system: 40% inthe liver, 8% in the spleen with minor urinary excretion (5% at 48 h).This method is able to follow human biodistribution of liposomes.</TEXT></DOC>
