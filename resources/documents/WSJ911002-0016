The analysis, by Veribanc Inc., a Wakefield, Mass.,research firm that tracks financial institutions, indicatesimprovement within the credit union industry despiterecessionary pressures and problems in the banking and thriftindustries. It drew on recently released data for the firstsix months of 1991 from the National Credit UnionAdministration.</LP><TEXT>   Specifically, the study cited fewer problem real estateloans at credit unions than at banks and Sandamp;Ls. As of June 30,foreclosed property held was 0.4% of credit unions' totalassets, compared with a 2.9% rate for banks, Veribanc said.Credit unions' total problem loans, less loss reserves, were3.97% of equity at June 30, down from 6.29% at Dec. 31, 1990.Also, a greater proportion of credit union depositors werefully insured. Veribanc said only 2% of all credit uniondeposits and shares were over $100,000, the maximum federallyinsurable amount for individual accounts. By contrast, 19% ofall bank deposits exceed the $100,000 deposit insurancelimit.   The federal data, released last week, included 11,222federally insured credit unions, 843 unions not federallyinsured and 44 central credit unions.</TEXT></DOC>
