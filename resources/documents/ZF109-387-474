 We're not sure how muchit will cost, but Softbridge products tend to be priced for the Ferrari crowdeven while Corporate America drives Datsuns.andP;  We've heard it will be calledAutomated Test Facility (ATF)--but marketing may jazz up the moniker beforethe rollout in 1Q91.andP;  What we are sure of is Softbridge's ATF will be themost important Windows product of 1991.andM;The reason is simple.andP;  Evangelists can always get corporations to experiment.andO;When it comes to software, big companies have 'one' of everything.andP;  (Sort oflike Imelda Marcos' affinity for shoes.)andP;  But if MIS can't test, evaluate,and support a package, it's doomed no matter how many users threaten to dousethemselves in gasoline if purchasing takes it off the 'approved' list.andM;Networked workstations running graphical user interfaces (GUIs) like Windowsthrew a real monkey wrench into automated testing.andP;  What users love aboutWindows is exactly what makes it virtually impossible to test in an automatedfashion--you move a mouse and push some buttons.andP;  Until now it's been quite afeat to replicate this kind of message stream.andP;  (Lotus reportedly paid 200people to sit and play with mice when it was testing 1-2-3/G.)andP;  This is headystuff.andP;  So we asked Softbridge's Greg Kee and Valerie O'Connell to explain...andM;ACKnowledge: What is ATF and what does it do?andM;Kee: Suppose you want to know what happens when 20 computer users go lookingfor the same database record.andP;  You develop a series of test cases, scriptthem in our Distributed Test Language (DTL), then record what happens.andP;  Thefirst few go-rounds you are looking to establish a baseline.andP;  Once you haveit, you begin doing destructive testing.andP;  Most of the testing going on now isexpensive and time-consuming, but the real purpose of testing is to abuse thesoftware, expose its weaknesses and faults.andP;  So a complete regression is runwith every change in the software.andM;A developer would define a baseline with some test scripts that are known torun a certain way.andP;  Every time a bug is fixed or the software is changed thedeveloper runs the new version against the same baseline.andP;  Then the developercan understand what has changed.andM;ACKnowledge: What kinds of things cause changes?andM;Kee: A change in the software.andP;  A developer needs to see that all the thingsthat worked before still work.andP;  You could change the hardware or networkconfiguration.andP;  In that case, maybe the only thing you want to know iswhether the software runs as well as it used to.andM;Or, you could change the operating environment.andP;  Say you're running Excel andyou get a new version.andP;  Corporations need to know that off-the-shelf softwarestill works.andP;  One of the scariest things is rolling out a new version of anyapplication to a large number of PC users.andP;  With ATF a corporation can besure the new version will work in its environment without making all usersbecome de facto beta testers.andM;ACKnowledge: Who is going to use this product?andM;O'Connell: Corporate users, software houses, Windows-based softwaredevelopers, and hardware companies who must know that their hardware runspopular applications successfully.andP;  Also some larger systems integratorsmight use it.andM;ACKnowledge: Okay.andP;  Let's say ATF resides on an OS/2 machine that you callthe 'Executive' and has a Presentation Manager interface that you call the'Executive User Interface.'andP;  The OS/2 server manages tapes, scripts, and datetables stored in a database.andP;  How does it work?andM;Kee: The scripts are run from the server.andP;  Scripts manipulate tapes, andtapes are the lowest level of granularity.andM;ATF is based on the premise that the consistency and performance of softwarecan be measured by comparing the output of a changed version with the outputof a previously-verified version.andP;  This is the premise behind virtually allsoftware testing and quality assurance.andP;  ATF automatically records a range ofoutput before and after a software change according to rules specified by ahuman tester.andP;  The tests then run automatically, and rigorously compare'before' and 'after' differences.andM;ACKnowledge: It sounds like you're recording what happens to users...?andM;Kee: In a way.andP;  You're familiar with the recorder in Windows?andP;  We developedthat recorder to Microsoft specs.andP;  However, for ATF we developed a brand newrecorder to meet the specific needs of testing.andP;  It handles some of thevagaries of Windows that are very good for the user, but very poor for atester.andP;  To test, you need to start with a beginning condition, not restorethe last condition.andM;O'Connell: Testing occurs on a Windows machine (what we're callingControllers) or whatever other platform you have.andP;  It's done at the interfacelevel.andP;  The analysis engine, on the other hand, is the OS/2-based server.andM;What's nifty here is the ability to simulate user interactions with Windowsapplications.andP;  The ATF system captures all mouse and keyboard interactionwith the application at the Windows event level -- and that's where Windowstesting always falls down.andP;  You can't effectively capture that informationand play it back in a meaningful way.andM;ATF restores the initial state the way it was when you recorded your tape.andO;Play it back and you return to that same initial state via DTL, a commandlanguage in ATF.andP;  It shows how the tape was created.andM;ACKnowledge: How does ATF know what to test?andM;O'Connell: It uses scripts.andP;  Each script contains a complete description ofthe environment in which a module or function to be tested will run, andcalls for more detailed test tapes.andP;  Scripts are a codification of the higherlevel test plan.andP;  ATF's recording feature is the primary means for creatingtest tapes.andP;  A test engineer simply performs whatever activity--mousemovement or keystroke--that would be required to execute a test sequence.andO;The activity is recorded for future playback and verified.andP;  Once taped, therecorded sequence can be called back by scripts for automated testing.andM;Kee: So what we've got here is the ability to simulate the user at anindividual workstation.andP;  But you can control dozens of workstations from asingle point.andP;  You can test network applications, client-server applications,and so on.andP;  ATF is designed to test GUI-based applications as well asapplications that operate over a network.andM;This is a sophisticated test environment.andP;  For example, tapes can be playedback at the recorded speed--or faster to stress the application.andP;  Forunattended testing here's an optional Omega Power Control card that can beput on workstations to recycle a test medicine rendered unusable because theapplication failed under test.andP;  There's a results log--each tapes playback iscentrally logged at the Executive (OS/2 server) end.andP;  Results are availableby scripts or by groups of scripts, and include version control.andP;  A scriptcan ask for a snapshot of the workstation screen.andP;  This snapshot can call fora screen bitmap capture with cyclical redundancy check, or can request ASCIIdata to be captured for a full screen or an individual window.andM;ATF allows Windows to create event records according to an event dictionarymanaged at the workstation level.andP;  And it's not limited to a predefinedkeyboard set in mapping logical characters to physical keystrokes.andM;ACKnowledge: I'll bet Lotus will be glad to hear about this.andP;  They must begoing nuts about now testing the Windows version of Lotus 1-2-3.andP;  Windows'keyboard conventions are the default, but 1-2-3 for Windows also runs in aspecial window and remaps the keyboard for those famous Lotus 1-2-3'head-down' users Jim Manzi spoke about.andP;  Does Lotus know about your product?andM;Kee: They do now!andM;ACKnowledge: Thanks for the preview, Valerie and Greg.andM;This isn't the only news from Softbridge.andP;  We first looked at its developmenttools last year when we review Bridge/286 and eight Windows shells (November26, 1989).andP;  At the time we said Bridge/286 is like moving from a bicycle to aBMW.andP;  Bridge is a truly powerful way to prototype a new application orcustomize an existing environment.andP;  For corporate developers, Bridge is justthe ticket for &quot;bridging&quot; the gap separating DOS and Windows.&quot;andM;During 1990, however, we didn't hear much from our friends at Softbridge.andO;Perhaps we were too bedazzled by 'object-orientedness' -- after all, ObjectOriented Programming (OOPs) non-believers are treated like flagburners inmore than one Northwestern state.andM;But now comes the good news!andP;  Softbridge has updated the Bridge Tool Kit forWindows 3.0.andP;  This product links DOS and Windows applications and is LANable.andO;Moreover, it can custom-tailor a workstation environment offering DOS andWindows applications, desk accessories, and other tools.andM;Softbridge has always offered a batch language similar to the DOS batchlanguage syntax.andP;  This upgrade adds super graphics, on-line help, and a macrobuilder called &quot;tape recorder&quot; that automates repetitive jobs.andP;  Othersignificant changes are an Editor that supports larger file formats, improvedWindows 3.0 icons, a &quot;File List&quot; function of searching directories and files,and .BMP support for full-color bitmaps, icons, and pushbottons.andP;  At $695($95 for the upgrade) this product is pricey, but what do you expect?andP;  It'saimed at the Fortune 1000.andM;Shipping in December is a new product--Bridge Batch--that Softbridge hopeswill appeal to power users, not programmers.andP;  Bridge Batch will be marketedfor $179 through retail stores--probably Egghead.andP;  Bridge Batch creates acustomized Windows interface with menus, dialog boxes, bitmaps, andicons--and it records macros much like PubTech Batchworks, a $99.95competitor from Publishing Technologies Inc. in Austin, TX.andP;  But Bridge Batchdoes a few things Batchworks doesn't--like handle mouse events and readWindows macros directly.andP;  Also, you can call Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs)directly from Bridge Batch, and save your work in SDK format.andP;  The other realdifference we can see between Bridge Batch and PubTech Batchworks is...about$80.andM;We wish Softbridge would reexamine its pricing policies.andP;  Back in 1988 whenits Bridge Tool Kit was introduced, competition was scarce.andP;  Now Softbridgewill have to duke it out with all the other OOP products, notably Asymetrix'Toolbook.andP;  Tookbook costs $495 and developers can sell the programs theycreate with it royalty-free.andP;  The Bridge Tool Kit costs $695 and developersget just three free runtimes (it used to offer only one free runtime!)andM;The Softbridge Group, 125 Cambridge Park Drive, Cambridge, MA 02140,617/576-2257.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
