(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Mississippi, which has one of the nation'shighest illiteracy rates and some of its poorest school districts,launched a campaign Tuesday to put teaching computers into everypublic elementary school.   The state will raise $13 million for the project over four yearswith the help of two foundations.   Gov. Ray Mabus said the Riordan Foundation of Los Angeles andthe RORD Foundation of New York will make an initial investment of$1.5 million to begin installing computers this fall and raise anadditional $5.5 million over the next three years. He said thestate would provide about $1.5 million a year in matching funds.   The computer learning system would be made available tokindergartens and first-grades.   ``We have a goal in Mississippi for everybody to read and write.I think today we are taking a big step in that direction,'' Mabussaid a news conference with Richard Riordan of the RiordanFoundation and Richard Dowling of the RORN Foundation.   The foundations presented the first $1.5 million to the governor.   Mabus said he hoped to get the computer labs _ which includecomputer work stations, listening library station and other workingareas _ in place in about one-third of the school districts by thisfall. The state has about 150 school districts.   The program will use an IBM system called ``Writing to Read,''which allows children to write anything they can say and read whatthey write. The system also allows children to learn at their ownpace.   ``We feel this is the way to teach literacy. It is a verywonderful system. The kids love it,'' Riordan said. ``What happensis they hear the words, they play games with it. They can't wait toget into the labs for the next session.   ``If they are slow, it doesn't criticize them. They really goodabout themselves,'' he said.   Mabus and his wife, Julie, have vowed to fight illiteracy in thestate. Based on 1980 census data, state officials estimate that asmany as 400,000 adults in Mississippi have less than nine years offormal education and that most of them are functionally illiterate.   Mabus said the project's goal is to ensure that ``every child inMississippi ... can read and write by the time they leave the firstgrade.''   ``What we are talking about is giving our students and teachersthe very best tools to teach reading and writing. Mississippi willbe the first state in the country _ to our knowledge _ to have suchan extensive computer literacy system for its children,'' he said.   Riordon said his foundation has provided for similar computerlearning systems in several California cities, and in Kansas City,Mo., Chicago and New York, but said most of those were pilotprojects.   He said this was the foundation's first statewide effort.</TEXT></DOC>
