The Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that burning the American flagas a form of protest is protected by free-speech guarantees.   ``If there is a bedrock principle underlying the First Amendment,it is that the government may not prohibit the expression of an ideasimply because society finds the idea itself offensive ordisagreeable,'' Justice William J. Brennan said in his opinion forthe court.   The U.S. Senate reacted Friday by passing legislation aimed atmaking desecration of the flag unlawful, and the House may considera similar resolution this week.   Bush supports legislation prohibiting the desecration of theflag, but has not decided whether to back a constitutionalamendement, his spokesman said Monday.   Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush ``shares the views ofmembers of Congress and others who have all expressed their feelingthat the flag should not be desecrated in any way.''   Bush, who said after the ruling that flag burning is ``deadwrong,'' told The New York Times in an interview published todaythat he has asked Attorney General Dick Thornburgh and Chief ofStaff John H. Sununu to recommend ways to circumvent the SupremeCourt decision.   Bush said he was ``open-minded'' about how to protect the flag.Lawmakers are divided on whether to offer legislation or seek aconstitutional amendment.   In Sacramento, the California Assembly voted 58-2 Monday to askCongress to amend the Constitution to outlaw flag burning.   ``What kind of message are we sending our children when we sayit's OK to burn the flag?'' Republican Assemblyman Tim Leslie askedin a debate in which he described his father's death during WorldWar II and displayed the flag used for his father's services.   Democratic Assemblyman John Burton, who opposed the resolution,said ``our country is great because we allow people to be wrong ...and do some stupidly outrageous things.''   In Illinois, the Senate unanimously approved a bill Monday thatwould make it a felony to intentionally place the flag on a floor.Offenders could receive up to six years in prison. The measure goesto Gov. James R. Thompson.   The bill was one of several proposed in response to an ArtInstitute of Chicago exhibit that featured a flag on the galleryfloor.   The bill's sponsor, Democratic Sen. Thomas Dunn, said placing theflag on the floor is ``the most insulting thing to do in thiscountry.''   The Senate on Friday also approved a resolution that calls forCongress to take measures to protect the flag from desecration.   In Findlay, about 1,000 people are expected to attend the rally,Ms. Buckingham said.   ``It's a hard pill to swallow that the Supreme Court would pass aruling that would support the burning of the American flag afterAmericans have given their lives for it,'' said Thomas Mazey,commander of a Veterans of Foreign Wars post in the Ohio town.</TEXT></DOC>
