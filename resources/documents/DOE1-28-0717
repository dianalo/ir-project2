The ratio of the indoor concentration to the outdoor concentrationof carbon monoxide, CO, varied between 0.36 to 0.78. Indoor outdoor concentrationratio of the total suspended particulates, TSP, and inhalable particles,IP, were between 0.1 to 0.70. Lead concentration in the atmosphere dependsheavily on the traffic density. This paper also analyzes those resultsand explores the possible reasons behind the high indoor outdoor concentrationratio.</TEXT></DOC>
