Aftera little background information, the author gets into the contents ofMSDS, terms used and what's in it for you. During the late 1960's andearly 1970's, a cultural revolution occurred, and chemical industry wasblessed with the creation of government agencies such as OSHA (The OccupationalSafety and Health Administration) and EPA (The Environmental ProtectionAgency). These agencies were charged with protecting employees, the publicand environment by imposing regulations on industry. As a result, theOSHA Form 20 was created. Regarding the chemical exposure the questionarises - how much is too much? It often varies among individuals, butoften there are clues in the MSDS. A TLV (Threshold Limit Value) or PEL(Permissible Exposure Limit) may be listed. This is the maximum averageconcentration of the chemical that should be in the air that you're breathing.An industrial hygienist can determine what your exposure is. This paperlists a TLV of 1000 ppm. Although waste disposal methods are includedin MSDS, state and local regulations vary and change so rapidly it'sbest to determine at the time of need the most appropriate, legally andenvironmentally acceptable disposal method. The authors' sample MSDSlists the physical data in Section II of this paper. Much of this datais useful for firefighting.</TEXT></DOC>
