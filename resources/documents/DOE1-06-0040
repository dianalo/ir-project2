Some special types of thesedetectors, the coulometric ECD and the so-called electron attachmentspectroscopy have advantages in comparison to conventional ECD modifications.The coulometric ECD permits to calculate the concentration of substancesin the air immediately from the signal of the detector, because the sensitivityfor compounds with an extremely high electron attachment cross-sectionis equal to Faradays number. The electron attachment spectroscopy makesit possible to change the mean electron energy in such a way, that themaxima for dissociative electron capture of toxic compounds (e.g. halocarbons)are reached. Examples for the application of both techniques in environmentalmonitoring are given.</TEXT></DOC>
