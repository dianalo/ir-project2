The sites, in Wisconsin, New Mexico, Texas and Washington, willnow be studied more closely for their environmental suitability anda final decision will be made sometime next year.   The Star Wars project is known formally as the SuperconductiveMagnetic Energy Storage program, or SMES, and will involve theconstruction of huge coils the size of a football field.   The idea behind the project is similar to that used by someutilities that have built excess generating capacity by usingelevated water reservoirs. The magnetic coils would be designed tohold huge amounts of electricity that can be ``pumped in'' whendemand is low, then discharged when needed.   The coils would utilize new breakthroughs in fashioningmaterials that can conduct electricity with little or no loss ofcurrent.   The Star Wars program is interested in the idea because of theproblem of powering large, ground-based lasers that are beingstudied as one possible defense against nuclear missiles.   ``Among the advantages SMES has to offer a ground-based laserare instantaneous response for vast power requirements; extremelyhigh energy conversion efficiency; relatively low cost; fuelindependence; siting ease; high availability; low maintenancecosts, and insensitivity to earthquake and blast,'' the Pentagonsaid.   The Defense Department identified the five finalist sites as theBadger Army Ammunition Plant near Baraboo, Wis.; Orogrande, N.M.,near the southeastern edite of the White Sands Missile Range; alaser experiment site already set up inside the White Sands MissileRange; a site near Monahans, Texas, located about 35 milessouthwest of Odessa, Texas, and the Energy Department's HanfordReservation near Richland, Wash.   The Pentagon previously had selected two contractors, BechtelNational Inc. and Ebasco Services Inc., to compete in developing adesign for the SMES. That Phase 1 work is be completed in May 1990,at which point the Pentagon plans to select one of the twocontractors and at the same time select a construction site for theprototype.   The Star Wars program is a research program aimed at developinglasers and other exotic weapons that could automatically shoot downany nuclear missiles fired at the United States.</TEXT></DOC>
