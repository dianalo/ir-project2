Lawmakers agreed to remove a provision in a Defense Department spending bill that would have barred the sale of four $526 million Aegis systems to Japan unless they were installed on U.S.-built ships.    Japan hasn't bought a foreign-built ship in nearly a century, according to Sen. Bill Bradley (D., N.J.), who offered the amendment to remove the stipulation on the sale. The Senate adopted the amendment by a voice vote after rejecting, 75-20, an attempt by Sen. Bennett Johnston (D., La.) to turn it aside.    The Reagan administration wants the Japanese to have the Aegis system so the Japanese may take over more of the task of protecting the air and sea lanes in the northwestern Pacific Ocean, near the Soviet Union. But Sen. Ted Stevens (R., Alaska) said &quot;providing the technology to Japan alone would weaken our competitive position with them and with other nations in shipbuilding.&quot;    While considering the $282.6 billion spending bill, which would fund the Pentagon for the year beginning Oct. 1, the Senate voted 50-44 to turn back an attempt by Sen. Malcolm Wallop (R., Wyo.) to add $500 million to planning for President Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative.    The additional funds would have increased next year's SDI research funding to $4.5 billion, just short of the $4.8 billion Mr. Reagan had requested. Cuts in spending on the space-based missile-defense system was one of the factors cited by the president in his veto of the Pentagon budget bill last week. </TEXT></DOC>
