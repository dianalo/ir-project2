LIM</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Opposition parties on Wednesday saidthe government must not cover up the growing scandal involvingalleged corruption by the brother of former President Chun Doo-hwan.   The opposition alleged that corruption by Chun's relatives andthe Saemaul development movement was widespread.   Saemaul, or New Community, which claims a membership of morethan 5 million community leaders, was formed in 1971 to improverural and urban living standards.   ``We warn the government against minimizing, covering up orwhitewashing the scandal,'' said Park Young-sook, acting presidentof the Party for Peace and Democracy. The rival oppositionReunification Democratic Party also called for an independentparliamentary probe.   Kim Tae-ryong, RDP spokesman, also demanded an investigationinto the Ilhae Foundation, a semi-official think tank establishedby Chun.   The government is investigating charges that Saemaul, whileheaded by Chun's younger brother, embezzled millions of dollars,sold patronage and forced donations.   The former president, who is on a private visit to the UnitedStates, installed his brother, Kyung-hwan, as Saemaul head. ChunKyung-hwan resigned in 1987 after being linked to gangsters lockedin a bloody power struggle.   Many political observers contend the Saemaul probe stemmed froma power game between President Roh Tae-woo and Chun, with Roh'ssupporters working to reduce the former president's power.   Roh, a former general picked by Chun to succeed him, is widelythought to be building popular support by proving corruption underChun. Roh has promised reforms since he won the country's firstdemocratic election last December.   ``The new government faces an unavoidable challenge ... theburdensome legacy of the old government,'' Don-A Ilbo, aninfluential Seoul newspaper, said in a commentary.   Newspapers said the Saemaul probe could be Roh's efforts todistance himself from Chun, who tried to retain power. Butgoverning party officials fear the growing scandal would erodetheir chances in National Assembly elections in April.   The Prosecutor General's office said Wednesday it had questionedabout 50 government and Saemaul officials about allegations offraud, embezzlement and influence peddling.   The prosecutors said Saemaul was found to have diverted some ofan estimated $130 million in funds to profit-oriented projects,land speculation and other irregular activities.</TEXT></DOC>
