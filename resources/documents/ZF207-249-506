Model 860 super-minicomputers, based on the VAX 6200, will beused in near real-time data management functions for radar and command andcontrol operations in two Air Force Joint Surveillance and Target AttackRadar System (J-STARS) planes.andM;J-STARS is a joint program between the Air Force and the Army to developairborne radar systems that can find, track, classify and identify groundtargets.andP;  The system will offer a panoramic view of the battlefield and showthe second echelon of troops, said Kevin Gilmartin, chief of media relationsin the Electronic Systems Division, Hanscom Air Force Base, Bedford, Mass.andM;Now commanders must rely on recognizance systems and photographs that showdated target information, he said.andM;&quot;What AWACS [Airborne Warning/Control System] airborne radar did for airbattle, J-STARS will do for the ground,&quot; Gilmartin said.andM;In late 1988 the project reached a major milestone when the first of the twomodified Boeing Co. 707 aircraft flew with the radar system, Gilmartin said.andO;Future tests will expand the amount of ground surveyed and number of vehiclesin the area, he said.andM;The Raytheon 860 super-minicomputer will be replacing Loral Corp. RolmMil-Spec Hawk computers, Gilmartin said.andP;  &quot;They performed well and met themilestones, but as the challenges increased the number of Rolms increased,&quot;he said.andP;  &quot;It became a space problem as much as anything else.&quot;andM;In a few years a contract will be let for a production fleet of 22 aircraft,and Rolm can try again.andP;  &quot;We love competition,&quot; Gilmartin said.andM;As a subcontractor to Grumman's Melbourne Systems Division in Florida, whichwas awarded the $750 million, five-year contract in 1985, Raytheon willsupply up to $17 million worth of computers and peripheral equipment.andM;Three 860s will be used on each of the two planes, and six computers will beused as spares, said Raytheon spokeswoman Janet E. Stewart.andM;The 860s have a 32-bit CPU, 32M of RAM and a total capacity of 7.1 millionsof instructions per second for each J-STARS plane, Stewart said.andM;The Militarized VAX Computer Family has three models, each having a differenttemperature range and capacity.andP;  The 860 is the most powerful system and itcan handle temperatures in the extreme range -- from -54 Celsius to 71Celsius, Stewart said.andM;The family, which was introduced last April, meets full military standardrequirements, Stewart said, adding that the J-STARS program is the firstannounced sale of the system.andP;  The computers were designed to be used tobuild off-the-shelf solutions tailored to different command, control,communications and intelligence applications, including radar dataprocessing, navigation and electronic warfare, she said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
