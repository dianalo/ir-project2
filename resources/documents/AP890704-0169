BOLT</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Mary Kay Cosmetics Inc., target of comic stripbarbs over animal testing and jokes about its pink Cadillacs, isdoing nicely, thank you, 3{ years after founders Mary Kay Ash andher son Richard R. Rogers took the company private in a $469 milliondeal.   Sales have increased 63.1 percent since 1985, the last year thecompany was publicly traded, reaching $406 million last year _ allthrough the efforts of 185,000 sales ``consultants,'' most of themwomen and some of them rich women.   Since Mrs. Ash founded the company in 1963, 33 consultants haveeach been paid more than $1 million in commissions. In Februaryalone, 10 ``national directors'' earned more than $20,000 each, withthe top director getting $40,303.53.   Mary Kay has an estimated 2 percent of the cosmetic market, butclaims as much as 9 percent of the skin-care products segment andabout 3.5 percent of the so-called glamour segment _ primarilymakeup.   The success of Mary Kay's leveraged buyout prompted Vice ChairmanJohn P. Rochon in May to venture a takeover of competitor AvonProducts Inc., which had $3 billion in mainly door-to-door saleslast year. Avon rejected the offer and Rochon has not broached thesubject publicly again.   At the time, Rochon said the ``cultures'' of Mary Kay and Avonwould remain distinct, but he said Avon would benefit from a touchof Mary Kay-style motivation.   The Mary Kay approach is slogan-filled.   ``God first, family second, career third;'' ``In business foryourself, but never by yourself;'' ``The go-give spirit'' are someof the sayings used to motivate the sales force.   A monthly magazine is entitled ``Applause,'' and gem-studdedjewelry is given to even new recruits.   Every year the company stages four sessions in which thousands ofMary Kay consultants descend on Dallas for a production-numberextravaganza. Top sellers are awarded minks, crowned and throned onstage at the Dallas Convention Center, and treated to a reception atMrs. Ash's pink mansion.   But it is the cars that have become the company signature.   Top achievers are given pink Cadillacs to drive for the rest oftheir lives, getting a new one every two years as long as theymaintain their high performance. Lesser efforts are rewarded bysmaller cars _ Buicks and Pontiacs.   There are about a thousand Mary Kay pink Cadillacs on the road,plus 1,000 Buicks and 3,000 Pontiacs.   Consultants earn money by selling cosmetics at home presentationsand recruiting other consultants.   Unlike some direct sale companies, each sales person ordersproducts directly from Mary Kay, and not from another person onestep up a sales ladder. Consultants do, however, receive commissionbased on the sales by their recruits.   Behind the flamboyance is a detailed program telling consultantseverything from how to set up business and do their accounting tohow they should dress. It provides a detailed code of ethics andoutlines how to win prizes.   Over this kingdom rules Mary Kay Ash, whose age is a closelyguarded secret, one she wouldn't even reveal to the Securities andExchange Commission.   Mrs. Ash, who is recovering from eye surgery and unavailable forinterviews, created the company in 1963 after leaving a firm thatwanted her to move every six months.   She was angry at her former employer and began cataloging theproblems facing businesswomen.   ``Mainly, I was doing it to help other women,'' she told oneinterviewer.   But President Richard Bartlett said Ms. Ash realized she reallywas creating an outline for a successful company, so she began toimplement it herself, even though some of those ideas ran counter toaccepted management and direct sales theory.   ``I thought that I knew about party planning when I came here,''said Bartlett, who spent time at Tupperware Home Products beforejoining Mary Kay in 1973. ``Where others were talking fun and games(at the home visits), she was deadly serious.   ``I had spent over 15 years learning that you couldn't do thosethings, that they wouldn't work,'' he said. ``They do and wethrive.''   He cites as examples her decision to limit the size of homepresentations to six people and abandoning the ``party approach''for a more serious ``skin care class.''   The company continues to take an adventurous approach to business.   Although admitting leveraged buyouts can be troublesome and draincompany resources to pay off debt, ``I think we're a shining exampleof LBOs,'' Bartlett said.   Before the LBO, ``We had a tendency to make decisions on what theshareholders would expect next, or that we thought the analyststhought,'' Bartlett said.   ``Now we can take the long view.''   An example of that view may be the company's decision earlierthis year to stop testing its products on animals.   The decision followed a long series of ``Bloom County'' comicstrips criticizing Mary Kay's testing, including one that comparedMrs. Ash to Ayatollah Khomeini.   It was not ridicule that led to the moratorium, Bartlett said,but ``the confusion and concern'' shown by Mary Kay's sales force,which he described as ``a microcosm of American women, middle-classand up demographically.''   Bartlett said the moratorium may cost Mary Kay sales, even thoughmost products planned through next year already have been cleared   The company also is trying to correct mistakes it made in theearly 1980s.   ``We got complacent with our product line. We laid back and saidwe had the world's finest product,'' Bartlett said.   The company lost much of its sales force as an improving economyopened more jobs to women.   Since then, the Mary Kay pitch has been restructured to appeal toworking women, Bartlett said.   Part of that plan is to have women in Mary Kay's top management,and even President Richard Bartlett says a woman should be presidentof the company.   Other than Mrs. Ash, whose official title is chairman emeritus,most top-level management is male, although there are many femalevice presidents.</TEXT></DOC>
