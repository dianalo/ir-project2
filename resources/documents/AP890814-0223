About 35,000 members of the Communications Workers of Americawent on strike Sunday against Chicago-based Ameritech, which serves12.3 million customers in the Midwest.   They joined more than 156,000 operators, installers and otheremployees at three other ``Baby Bells'' _ NYNEX, Bell Atlantic, andPacific Telesis _ who entered the second week of their walkout today.   Terry Tilden of the State Library in Harrisburg, Pa., said todaythe reference desk has been receiving numerous calls from peopleneeding phone numbers but unable to reach directory assistance.   ``One day last week I had the Manhattan white pages and thePhiladelphia white pages out and didn't bother reshelfing thembetween calls,'' he said. ``One lady said something like trying toget through to directory assistance was giving her heartburn.''   In Indiana, 2,100 managers at Ameritech subsidiary Indiana Bellbraced for today's start of the work week after learning how to takeoperator-assistance calls and service requests.   ``We got through yesterday pretty good,'' spokesman Estel Gibsonsaid. ``Our management operators were answering calls in four to sixseconds, and we were staying current on repairs. Today's going to bemore of a challenge.''   The regional companies already on strike have said that mostdirect-dial calls were going through normally on automatedequipment. Some union jobs were filled by management employees, butthe walkouts disrupted installations and repairs, operator-assistedcalls and inquiries to directory assistance.   There were few signs of progress in resolving any of thedisputes, which center on wages and company plans to cut back healthbenefits.   Nevertheless, the CWA reached agreement Sunday with U S West,which serves 14 Western states, and with Southwestern Bell TelephoneCo., which has 11 million customers in Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma,Texas and Arkansas.   In both cases, the union accepted lower-than-hoped-for wageincreases in exchange for company agreements to maintain healthbenefits more or less intact. Workers at U S West, based in theDenver area, settled for an immediate 5 percent increase, while St.Louis-based Southwestern Bell agreed to a 5.25 percent hike.   The accords averted strikes by 42,000 U S West workers and 41,000employees of Southwestern Bell.   Union officials reached agreement Aug. 5 with the seventhregional company, Atlanta-based BellSouth.   In Boston, union leaders want customers to stop paying theirphone bills and are planning a rally Tuesday to draw attention totheir opposition to demands that employees pick up a larger share oftheir health insurance.   Calvey, business manager of International Brotherhood ofElectrical Workers Local 2222 in Quincy, Mass., which is strikingagainst New England Telephone, said insurance is the major issue.``The others you can compromise on,'' he said.   ``If the big companies, the ones that can afford it, begin takinga stand against paying medical benefits, the whole national healthcare issue will go on the back burner,'' Calvey said. New EnglandTelephone is part of NYNEX.   The Boston Herald reported today that former Democraticpresidential candidate Jesse Jackson would attend the rally to helplaunch the protest.   The seven Baby Bells were created by the 1984 breakup of AmericanTelephone andamp; Telegraph. Each has sought to get workers to pay alarger share of their health insurance costs, which have soared attwice the rate of inflation in recent years.   In Chicago, CWA and Ameritech officials said they were willing totalk, but neither side seemed in a hurry.   Talks ``have not occurred in any of the states, nor do weanticipate any occurring in the next few days,'' Ameritech spokesmanSteve Ford said Sunday. The company's subsidiaries in Illinois,Michigan, Indiana, Ohio and Wisconsin were negotiating separatelywith the union.   The IBEW, which has been on strike against the three otherregional companies but settled its contract with Ameritech, wasrespecting picket lines on Sunday, said Greg Kenefick, a CWAspokesman in Cleveland. But Illinois Bell spokesman Larry Cose saidhe had no indication the IBEW employees had joined the walkout.   Talks in the Bell Atlantic dispute were scheduled to resume todayin Washington, where phone company representatives met for an hourSunday with union officials representing workers in Pennsylvania,New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, Delaware and theDistrict of Columbia.   The strikes involve 60,000 workers at New York-based NYNEX, whichserves New York, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Maine, New Hampshire,Vermont, and Connecticory     08-14 0250</TEXT><NOTE>BC-ACC--Access Menu Advisory,0266</NOTE><NOTE>EDITORS:</NOTE><TEXT>   Following is the list of graphics which have moved on GraphicsNetand are currently available on AP Access.
