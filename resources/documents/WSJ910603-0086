Mr. Wallach was convicted in August 1989 of taking illegalpayments from Wedtech Corp., a defunct defense contractor, inreturn for promising to use his influence with Mr. Meese andother federal officials.</LP><TEXT>   But the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals on Fridayordered a new trial for Mr. Wallach and two co-defendants,Rusty Kent London and Wayne Franklyn Chinn. The appeals courtsaid Mr. Wallach and the co-defendants were deprived of afair trial because one of the government's two key witnesseslied to the jury.   The perjured testimony of Anthony Guariglia, formerlyWedtech's president, wasn't directly related to the chargesagainst Messrs. Wallach, London and Chinn. But the appealscourt said Mr. Guariglia &quot;was the centerpiece of thegovernment's case&quot; and that the jury might have decideddifferently had it known that he was lying under oath intestifying against the defendants.   Gerard E. Lynch, chief of the criminal division for theU.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan, said prosecutors arereviewing the decision and hadn't decided whether to retrythe case. He said his office is considering an appeal.   Robert Bork, the former federal judge who represented Mr.Wallach on appeal, said the government couldn't have won thecase without the testimony of Mr. Guariglia. &quot;I don't see howthey could have won,&quot; Mr. Bork said. &quot;He was a crucialwitness. . . . I would be very surprised if the governmenttook this to trial again.&quot;   Mr. Wallach, a former San Francisco attorney, said, &quot;Ifind it hard to believe that honorable prosecutors willcontinue this effort.&quot; He said he plans to seek readmissionto the California bar today.   Mr. Guariglia's testimony linked the Wallach defendants tothe illegal conduct at Wedtech, in which the company and thedefendants allegedly misrepresented the work for whichWedtech was paying them. The defendants said they providedlegitimate and valuable services such as lobbying for DefenseDepartment contracts.   In the perjured testimony, Mr. Guariglia told the Wallachjury he had stopped gambling compulsively in 1988. In fact,Mr. Guariglia, who had pleaded guilty to bribery charges inthe case, had gone to a casino and gambled, which he wasbarred from doing under his cooperation agreement withprosecutors. He was convicted this year of two counts ofperjury, but the U.S. Attorney's Office has maintained thatit didn't learn of the perjury until after the Wallach trialended.   The appeals court said the government should have knownthat Mr. Guariglia was lying when he testified and suggestedit may have purposely used the perjured testimony to win itscase.   &quot;We are convinced that the government should have knownthat Guariglia was committing perjury,&quot; the appeals courtsaid. &quot;Had it been brought to the attention of the jury thatGuariglia was lying after he had purportedly undergone amoral transformation and decided to change his ways, hisentire testimony may have been rejected by the jury.&quot;   The decision was approved by two members of a three-judgepanel; the third judge agreed that the convictions should bereversed but said in a concurring opinion that theprosecutors acted correctly in believing Mr. Guariglia at thetime.   Mr. Lynch of the U.S. Attorney's Office said, &quot;Weabsolutely and categorically deny that the prosecutors wereaware of the false testimony by Guariglia.&quot;   Gary P. Naftalis of Kramer, Levin, Nessen, Kamin andamp;Frankel, who represented Mr. Wallach at his trial, said,&quot;It's perfectly clear that Bob Wallach wouldn't have beenconvicted of any crime in a fairly conducted trial.&quot;   Mr. Wallach was sentenced to six years in prison and fined$250,000. Mr. London was sentenced to five years and fined$250,000. Mr. Chinn was given a three-year term and was fined$100,000.   The Wallach trial was one of several stemming from theWedtech scandal. The New York-based company grew in the1980s, mainly through a federal program that provided defensecontracts to minority-owned businesses without competitivebidding. The business collapsed in 1986 amid allegations ofcorruption, including influence peddling, links to organizedcrime and bribery.   ---   MENTAL HEALTH services ordered for troubled fosterchildren in Alabama.   The settlement of an unusual suit against the AlabamaDepartment of Human Resources will change the way emotionallydisturbed foster children are treated in the state. Under aconsent decree subject to approval in federal court, theAlabama foster care system must adopt standards that takeinto account the children's special needs.   The standards include a requirement that children in statecustody have access to psychological counseling and skillstraining, among other services. The foster care system inAlabama, as in most other states, previously didn't provideservices tailored to emotionally disturbed youth. Suchservices were usually offered only by state mental health andjuvenile corrections departments.   Lawyers and mental health advocates praised the Alabamasettlement, calling it likely to reduce the number ofchildren statewide who are transferred repeatedly amongfoster homes or sent to psychiatric hospitals because ofbehavior disorders.   &quot;This will be a model for systems throughout the nationthat serve children with emotional or behavioral problems,&quot;said Ira Burnim, director of the Washington-based MentalHealth Law Project and a lawyer for the children who broughtthe class-action suit. Mr. Burnim said recent studiesindicate that as many as 40% of foster children nationwidehave been diagnosed as having behavioral or emotionaldisorders.   Andy Hornsby, commissioner of the defendant Department ofHuman Resources, said the parties had agreed that&quot;improvements need to be made in Alabama's child foster caresystem.&quot;   ---   OWNER OF FAILED HEALTH CLUB is ordered to refundmemberships.   A New York trial judge found the owner liable because hefailed to post a bond to provide at least partial membershipfee refunds if the club went out of business.   Health clubs often fail during a recession, and states areincreasingly requiring them to post bonds as a condition ofdoing business. Nonetheless, many don't. The decision toextend personal liability to the club's owner -- a first inNew York -- may be an indication that prosecutors and judgesare beginning to clamp down.   &quot;We have sued 12 health clubs over the past nine months,&quot;said Ronna Brown, a consumer fraud prosecutor who handled thecase. &quot;In a number of them we are pursuing owners as well ascorporations if it can be shown that the owners had any kindof involvement.&quot;   Anthony Verderame, owner of 21st Century Leisure SpaInternational Ltd. of New York, contended that his formermanager mismanaged the facility. But Judge Edward J.Greenfield disagreed, finding a persistent pattern of fraud.Apart from failing to secure a bond, the judge said, the clubowner continued to sign up members long after he was awarethat the club faced imminent collapse.   ---   BOY SCOUTS are temporarily allowed to expel youths indispute over pledge.   The scouting organization won an order from the CaliforniaCourt of Appeals that put on hold a trial judge's earlierorder. The appellate court's action means that, at leastuntil trial, the Boy Scouts won't be forced to readmitnine-year-old twins who wouldn't pledge to do their &quot;duty toGod,&quot; as required by the Cub Scout oath.   Objectors said the scouting group illegally discriminateson the basis of religion. The Boy Scouts argued that itsconstitutional right to freedom of association outweighs thestate's interest in preventing religious discrimination.   ---   NOTED: Four partners and six associates from the New Yorkoffice of Dow, Lohnes andamp; Albertson will join Baer Marks andamp;Upham, also in New York.
