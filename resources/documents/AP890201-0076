(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A battle that began a year ago today whentwo Indians took over a small-town newspaper to draw attention toalleged corruption remains unresolved, with the two fugitives suingthe state.   Eddie Hatcher and Timothy Jacobs, who were acquitted in Decemberon federal hostage-taking charges in connection with the siege inLumberton, filed the lawsuit Tuesday, alleging the state washarassing them by filing separate charges.   The lawsuit also was filed by the Robeson County DefenseCommittee, a group of Indians and blacks formed during the past yearto voice concern about ``oppression.''   Jacobs' attorney, Lewis Pitts, said the group's involvement inthe lawsuit shows the people of Robeson County ``are a changedpeople.''   ``No longer will they sit by and take the reign of terror and theoppression, and this lawsuit reflects their changed attitude,'' saidPitts.   ``They are calling the emperor naked. That's the positive spirithere one year after the takeover.''   Hatcher says he doesn't see an end to the standoff.   ``Just because I'm not in North Carolina doesn't mean I'm not intheir hair,'' he said in a telephone interview from Idaho, where heis seeking sanctuary with the Shoshone-Bannock Indians.   Brandishing sawed-off shotguns, the Tuscarora Indians walked intoThe Robesonian newspaper office in Lumberton, and took up to 20hostages.   They said they had evidence of law enforcement involvement indrug trafficking in Robeson County, whose population is evenlydivided between blacks, whites and Indians. Hatcher also saidfederal officials were repeatedly presented with informationconcerning racial injustice and police corruption in Robeson Countyover the years, but failed to rectify the problems.   Gov. Jim Martin ended the siege without injuries to the hostagesby agreeing to form a task force to investigate the allegations.   Hatcher and Jacobs were charged with federal firearms violationsand hostage-taking, held in a federal prison at Butner, then movedthrough a series of county jails while awaiting trial.   They were denied bond three times before a three-judge panel ofthe U.S. Court of Appeals ordered their release in July. The fullappeals court later agreed to reconsider that decision and orderedthem back to jail.   Jacobs complied, but Hatcher fled and surfaced a few days beforehis trial in September with a lawyer from the Center forConstitutional Law in New York.   After a three-week trial, a federal jury on Oct. 14 acquitted thetwo of all charges.   Hatcher and Jacobs had met with the task-force panel once, but itconcluded there was no evidence to back up their charges.   On Dec. 6, a special session of the Robeson County grand juryindicted the pair on 14 charges of second-degree kidnapping. Hatcherwas arrested at the offices of the Robeson County Defense Committeethat day, but Jacobs fled to New York.   Hatcher was freed on $25,000 bond, which was posted by theNational Council of Churches, but jumped bail and fled to theOnondaga Reservation near Syracuse, N.Y., where Jacobs was hiding.Hatcher later left New York for Idaho.   Jacobs was arrested Dec. 13 outside the reservation after fleeingfrom a state trooper and crashing his car into an empty school bus.His $25,000 bond also was posted by the National Council of Churches.   Hatcher failed to make a court appearance in Robeson Countyearlier this month, saying he feared for his life should he return,and his bond was ordered forfeited. Jacobs' extradition is pending.   The lawsuit says the state charges are just ``intimidation andharassment,'' and asks a federal judge to block their extraditionand declare the state charges unconstitutional.   It asks for at least $10,000 in damages from each of the 20defendants and a judgement ``declaring unconstitutional the campaignof intimidation and harassment'' it alleges is being conducted inRobeson County.   The lawsuit, which was filed by the defense committee, namesMartin, state Attorney General Lacy Thornburg, and several other lawenforcement officials as defendants.   Thornburg said the state did not intend to stop pressing forextradition.   ``It is clear that this lawsuit represents a thinly disguisedeffort to prevent the state of North Carolina from pursuing theextradition and criminal prosecution of Mr. Hatcher and Mr. Jacobsfor holding 14 innocent people at gunpoint and against their will,''Thornburg said.   ``The state will do everything within its power to see that theseindividuals are extradited to North Carolina to stand trial on statecharges.''</TEXT></DOC>
