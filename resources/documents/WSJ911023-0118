The official, Abdur Sakhia, also gave details of BCCI'srole in the Iran-Contra affair and provided furtherdisclosures about BCCI Holdings (Luxembourg) S.A. and itsU.S. units. Its First American Bankshares Inc. subsidiarymade large loans to Gary Hart's presidential bid in 1984, andit also made loans to former Atlanta mayor, Andrew Young,that were later forgiven, Mr. Sakhia said.</LP><TEXT>   The former BCCI official testified yesterday before theSenate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Terrorism, Narcoticsand International Operations. He called BCCI -- which wasseized by Western regulators on July 5 -- &quot;a tragedy ofimmense magnitudes,&quot; with its principal victims the bank'sdepositors and its 14,000 employees in 73 countries.   But he said the &quot;players&quot; behind the multibillion-dollarfraud &quot;are few.&quot; He blamed BCCI's &quot;European directors, ahandful of Middle Eastern businessmen or middle men, ahandful of executives from the {Indian} subcontinent, onefirm of auditors, and high-priced American lobbyists andlawyers,&quot; with their &quot;principal regulator Bank of England.&quot;   Mr. Sakhia said he is &quot;shocked and horrified&quot; at the lackof accountability of Price Waterhouse, which bears &quot;theprimary, if not the sole, responsibility&quot; in the BCCI affair.The accounting firm, which was sole auditor of BCCI since1987, has &quot;been completely negligent, incompetent, andpossibly corrupt and an accomplice in the fraud,&quot; heasserted. Price Waterhouse, which has vigorously denied anywrongdoing, also received a $600,000 loan from BCCI, he said.   After spending 14 years with BCCI in Canada, the U.S. andBritain, Mr. Sakhia left the bank in July 1990. He iscooperating with U.S. law enforcement authorities and bankingregulators in return for immunity from prosecution.   In yesterday's testimony, Mr. Sakhia was emphatic thatBCCI's Washington lawyers, Messrs. Clifford and Altman -- whoalso ran First American Bankshares Inc. as chairman andpresident of one of its main subsidiaries until August --must have known about BCCI's covert control of that and otherU.S. financial institutions.   He described a July 1988 meeting at the Washington officesof BCCI's U.S. lawyers, Clifford andamp; Warnke, at which Mr.Clifford had joked to one of Mr. Sakhia's BCCI colleagues:&quot;Welcome aboard. We will tell more lies now.&quot;   Mr. Sakhia claimed he had attended meetings where Mr.Altman and other senior BCCI executives referred to secretagreements under which BCCI retained control of IndependenceBank of Encino, Calif. Both Messrs. Clifford and Altman haveconsistently denied that they knew of BCCI's secret controlof First American and other U.S. financial institutions. Andtheir lawyers haven't returned recent phone calls.   Banking regulators woke up to BCCI's secret ownership ofFirst American and other U.S. financial institutions thisyear. But Mr. Sakhia said his impression prior to then wasthat &quot;authorities were aware of&quot; BCCI's control of suchinstitutions and that &quot;this was an arrangement with theauthorities,&quot; because &quot;we used to openly meet&quot; and &quot;operatedas one institution.&quot;   Mr. Sakhia also told panel members about inquiries thebank had received from the Federal Bureau of Investigationrelating to the Iran-Contra affair. The FBI had soughtrecords from BCCI's Monte Carlo branch, Mr. Sakhia said.Those records detailed bank loans to the controversial SaudiArabian businessman Adnan Khashoggi that had been used tohelp finance weapons that were sold to Iran. Some of theprofit from those sales went to BCCI, Mr. Sakhia said.   The manager of BCCI's Monte Carlo office had been paid$100,000, Mr. Sakhia said, &quot;presumably by U.S. governmentofficials&quot; for his part in the Iran-Contra scheme. Mr. Sakhiasaid he had seen a check paid by Mr. Khashoggi to themanager.   Senator John Kerry (D., Mass.), who heads the Senatepanel, released bank documents showing that BCCI deposited a$10 million check in the name of a company controlled by Mr.Khashoggi in the Cayman Islands, as part of the Iran-Contrascheme.</TEXT></DOC>
