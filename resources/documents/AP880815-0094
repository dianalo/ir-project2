(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Legislature today began the sixth dayof a special session called to abolish a century-old system oflocal government purchasing, a reform prompted by an FBI probe ofcorruption.   The House and Senate reconvened this morning in an effort tosettle differences that deadlocked conferees late Sunday night.   Rep. H.L. ``Sonny'' Merideth said he would recommend today thatthe Legislature adjourn and go home.   ``I'm sure the House will be disappointed as I know the Senatewould,'' Merideth said. ``But the House's position is that unlessyou can get something that is reasonable and workable and doesn'thave the potential to self-destruct, we can wait until another dayfor a better bill.''   Senate negotiators had no immediate comment.   The 1988 legislative session ended in May with conferees failingto agree on reform legislation.   Gov. Ray Mabus remained optimistic. ``We're of the belief thatnobody is interested in going home without resolving the matter,''Mabus' spokesman Cliff Treyens said.   The FBI's Operation Pretense probe resulted in the arrests of 52supervisors in 24 counties. Forty-three were convicted or pleadedguilty and 23 received prison sentences. The charges ranged fromextortion to mail fraud.   The House has approved a bill that would require counties toadopt central purchasing systems.   Currently, county supervisors oversee all purchasing in theirdistricts. The new system would give an appointed administratorpower over day-to-day purchasing for the entire county, whilekeeping policy in the hands of supervisors.   Supervisors would still award contracts, but the administratorwould be responsible for purchasing materials and overseeingprojects.   The Senate wants to exempt some small counties from the newplan, arguing they can't afford to hire an administrator. The Housewants no exemptions.   As state auditor for the four years before he was electedgovernor in 1987, Mabus assisted the FBI in its investigation.</TEXT></DOC>
