U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton on Friday moved the startingdate to July 24 after ex-CIA agent Joseph Fernandez said theprosecution's case has been tainted by his immunized congressionaltestimony.   In a related case, U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell onFriday rejected a motion by former National Security Council aideOliver North for a post-trial hearing. North, convicted May 4 ofthree felonies stemming from the Iran-Contra affair, had contendedthat the evidence against him was prejudiced by his testimonybefore Congress during televised hearings in 1987.   Gesell said North's lawyers raised no new issues to warrantanother hearing or dismissal of the charges. The judge concluded ina June 16, 1988, ruling that North's congressional testimony ``wasnot submitted to the grand jury in any form.''   In the Fernandez case, Hilton denied a motion to dismiss thecase, but the judge said he will look further into what steps theprosecution took to insulate itself from Fernandez' testimony.   Fernandez, the CIA's former station chief in Costa Rica, isaccused of obstructing and lying to the CIA inspector general'soffice and the presidential Tower commission.   He allegedly told investigators that a secret airstrip in CostaRica built as part of North's secret resupply network for theNicaraguan Contra rebels was an initiative of the Costa Ricangovernment.   Fernandez allegedly told the Tower panel he did not know for afact that North was assisting the resupply effort, which wasprohibited by Congress.   Under immunity from prosecution, Fernandez later toldcongressional investigators the airstrip was tied into the resupplyeffort and that North was part of it.   Fernandez lawyer Thomas Wilson said two CIA employees, ColeBlack and Louis Dupart, were familiar with Fernandez' immunizedtestimony, yet were questioned extensively by prosecutors.   Wilson said Black maintained he was unable to ``ferret out''what he learned from Fernandez' immunized testimony and what helearned from non-immunized testimony. Prosecutor Robert Longstrethdisputed Wilson's contention, saying prosecutors' questions toBlack were framed narrowly and that none of his answers was basedon Fernandez' immunized testimony.   A Supreme Court ruling bars prosecutors from making any use ofsomeone's immunized testimony in prosecuting the person. The officeof independent counsel Lawrence Walsh, which is prosecutingFernandez, has gone to extreme lengths to wall itself off from suchtestimony, Longstreth said.   Walsh's office will supply the court with information on thesteps it has taken to remain free from the taint of immunizedtestimony, the judge said at the end of a hearing.   The trial is expected to last about three weeks. ProsecutorLaurence Shtasel said the government will call 15 to 18 witnessesand take five to seven days to present its case. Wilson said thedefense will take a ``similar amount of time.''</TEXT></DOC>
