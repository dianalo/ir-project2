The official stressed, however, these military salesessentially are in two distinct categories: those that answerSaudi Arabia's immediate security needs and those that wouldhelp safeguard its long-term interests.</LP><TEXT>   The official rejected the notion that this was a singletransaction. &quot;It isn't one big package,&quot; and he stressed that&quot;the size of some sales will depend on how the situation (inthe Persian Gulf) unfolds.&quot;   Since Iraq's Aug. 2 seizure of Kuwait, the U.S. has so faragreed to sell Saudi Arabia 24 F-15 jet fighters at a cost ofabout $2.3 billion. These are expected to come out of U.S.inventory and should be delivered quite quickly, theadministration official said.   Future sales to Saudi Arabia are expected to include suchitems as Apache helicopters, M-1 tanks, Bradley FightingVehicles, Stinger anti-aircraft missiles and Patriot airdefense systems.   In Jerusalem, Israeli officials reacted with concern tothe prospects of a large U.S. arms sale to the Saudis. &quot;Weobject to this kind of arms deal and find it a threat,&quot; saidone official. The potential volume, number and sophisticationof the weapons under consideration could &quot;affect thequalitative edge&quot; the Israeli forces rely on to deter an Arabattack.</TEXT></DOC>
