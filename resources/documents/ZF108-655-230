(products).andO;Product:   ToolBook (Program development software).andO;Topic:     EvaluationSoftware PackagesProgrammingProgram Development Tools.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Our special report on Windows 3.0 in the May 1990 issue of The outlookincluded a brief summary of several new programming tools designed toexpedite the creation of Windows 3.0 applications by both serious programmersand the end-user community.andP;  ToolBook 1.0 by Asymetrix Corporation (110-110thAvenue N.E., Suite 717, Belleview, WA 98004; 800-624-8999) was chosen for amore in-depth review as the current front-runner among the new breed ofObject-Oriented Programming (OOP) tools becoming available as softwaredevelopers rush to exploit the technical strengths and popularity of Windows3.0.andM;Asymetrix Corporation, a company of 70+ staff, founded in 1985 by Microsoftco-founder Paul Allen, announced ToolBook as the company's first product onMay 21, 1990.andP;  Asymetrix has already established strategic alliances withseveral major hardware and software vendors including Microsoft, Zenith Datasystems, IBM, and Olivetti.andP;  The major coup was the landing of a licensingagreement with Microsoft whereby a runtime version of ToolBook and twoToolBook applications are being shipped with every English language retailcopy of Windows 3.0.andP;  Zenith Data systems has also announced that ToolBookwill be installed on all of its 386-based desktop systems.andP;  In addition,Asymetrix has formed working relationships with over 70 independent softwarevendors (ISVs) including Lotus, Macromind, Neuron Data, and the WhitewaterGroup.andP;  ToolBook-based software under development includes graphicalfront-ends to databases, knowledge-based systems, and long on-line documents,corporate and university level courseware, multimedia presentations,graphical on-line help, on-line catalogs, clip-art collections, and more.andM;The company is marketing ToolBook through retail software distributionchannels including Softsel/MicroAmerica, Ingram/MicroD, and Egghead DiscountSoftware.andP;  The complete development version of ToolBook has a suggestedretail price of $395.andP;  For more information, readers can call (800) 624-8999,extension 299H.andM;ToolBook is billed as a software construction set which allows the user torapidly develop applications which will run under the Windows 3.0 environmentwithout the difficulties associated with formal programming.andP;  ToolBook can beviewed as a superset of Apple's HyperCard.andP;  Without getting into a detailedcomparison of ToolBook and HyperCard features, which would no doubt be boringto a majority of our readers, it is sufficient to say that their similaritiesare rather striking.andP;  In fact, they are similar enough that The HyperCardMedia Group has developed a program called ConvertIt! which willautomatically handle about 80% of the work required to convert complexHyperCard stacks to ToolBook books.andP;  And now we hear that the similaritiesbetween HyperCard and ToolBook have not escaped the attention of Paul Heckel,who sued Apple last year and eventually got them to pay big bucks to licensehis HyperRacks patent.andP;  Heckel now claims that ToolBook also uses hispatented technique, and it is rumored that he may take legal action againstboth Asymetrix and Microsoft.andM;ToolBook was designed to meet the needs of many types of users includingprofessional developers and PC coordinators, educators, corporate trainers,multimedia authors, computer enthusiasts, and end users in general.andP;  There isplenty of evidence that many professional software developers are embracingToolBook as a CASE tool which meets their needs to bring more sophisticatedWindows-based software products to market more rapidly.andP;  In keeping with theapproach we have adopted for analyzing CASE tools, this review will focus onToolBook from a non-programmer's perspective, since this represents theultimate challenge and primary domain for the emerging desktop programmingmarket.andM;Installing ToolBookandM;ToolBook comes with a sizeable set of documentation including these titles:Getting Started, Using ToolBook, Using OpenScript, Quick Reference, andRelease Notes.andP;  The 21-page Getting Started manual contains the instructionsfor installing ToolBook and for taking ToolBook's Quick Tour.andM;As it should be, the first topic covered in the Getting Started booklet isthe minimum system requirements for running ToolBook, which are: -A personalcomputer with an 80286 or higher processor -Microsoft Windows version 3.0-DOS3.1 or higher 640K  plus 256K extended memory (1.5 MB memory recommended)-One 1.2 MB (5.25 &quot;) or 720K (3.5&quot;) disk drive -A hard disk with 2 MB to 8 MBof free disk space, depending on whether you choose to install the samplebooks and the on-line help book -A monitor and adapter card for VGA, EGA, orHercules graphics -A Windows-compatible mouse or other pointing deviceandM;Asymetrix offers several levels of technical support to its customers,including free hotline support for 90 days, a one-year hotline support plan,a 900 number for which the user is billed on an as-used basis, a free supportnewsletter, and a bulletin board forum for submitting technical questions andexchanging information and programs.andM;You must install Windows 3.0 and be ready to run in standard or enhanced modebefore installing and running ToolBook.andP;  We successfully installed thecomplete suite of ToolBook software, using the five 3.5 inch diskettes, inless than 15 minutes.andP;  The installation manual also contains information forthe more advanced users to customize ToolBook features by editing the Windows3.0 Win.Ini file.andP;  Asymetrix wisely anticipated the problems which a largeportion of the current DOS user community might experience during thetransition to a world full of mice and windows by favoring a DOS keyboardcommand installation and startup procedure over the more glitzy grandentrance via the Windows 3.0 GUI.andP;  By following the startup procedures, yourfirst mandatory contact with a mouse involves double-clicking one of theicons representing various books displayed in a window titled ToolBookBookshelf.andM;Getting StartedandM;It is recommended that users new to the Windows type of GUI go straight forthe ToolBook Quick Tour.andP;  This tour, created using ToolBook, contains anexcellent interactive tutorial on using the mouse, basic forms of Windows 3.0interaction, and an introduction to ToolBook concepts.andP;  In addition to theQuickTour, the ToolBook Bookshelf contains several sample ToolBookapplications you can explore for ideas about building books.andP;  You areencouraged to change these applications to suit your particular needs or copyparts of them to your own applications.andP;  Some of these books contain buttons,pages, scripts, clip art, and animation effects you can copy and use in yourown applications.andP;  Realistically, however, you will not be able to turn yourideas into any form of useful reality without several hours of concentratedstudy of Using ToolBook (439 pages), accompanied by hands-on experimentation.andM;ToolBook also comes with on-line help in the form of HelpBook, anotherToolBook-created application.andP;  HelpBook not only provides extensive on-linehelp information that comes in very handy during the initial ToolBooklearning phase, but it also serves as an excellent example of how moderngraphical and navigation techniques can be used to facilitate access toselected topics from a large base of technical information.andP;  For example, wefound the HelpBook history file search option to be a particularly usefulfeature.andP;  HelpBook automatically builds a history file of topics for whichyou have requested help.andP;  You can easily re-visit any of the previous topicsby selecting from a sequential list of topics presented in the form ofoptions in a pulldown history file menu.andP;  Like most ToolBook-supplied books(except DayBook), HelpBook can be examined in author mode and can be modifiedto serve as a starting point for a custom on-line help file.andP;  The only thingthat we would like to sec added to the ToolBook approach for providingon-line help is the incorporation of context sensitive help (i.e., respondingto a user's request for help with relevant help information based on thecontext of the function in progress).andM;A ToolBook application consists of one or more books that are designed for aparticular purpose, such as training, personal information management (PIM),entertainment, or even a front-end GUI for another application.andP;  Pages of abook are stored as a DOS file.andP;  You build a book by creating pages and youlink the pages together by creating scripts which define the actions whichyou want the book to perform.andP;  Other features include hypernavigationcapabilities to link related information, flat-file database capabilities,object animation techniques, and text processing and formatting.andM;ToolBook has two working levels, the Reader level and the Author level.andP;  As aToolBook Reader, you can normally open and save books, flip through pages,add pages, input and edit text fields, print, and run scripts.andP;  Exactly how areader uses a book depends on how the author designed it.andP;  As a reader, youmight answer questions by typing or selecting checkboxes, and performcalculations by either typing numbers or clicking on buttons with numericlabels.andP;  Only ToolBook features tightly tied to Windows 3.0 mechanismsprovide user interface consistency across applications (e.g., windowmanipulations, file opening, file saving, and searching operations).andM;At the Author level, you can create new books, create and modify objects onpages, and create scripts.andP;  In keeping with an object-oriented approach,ToolBook's buttons, fields, graphics, hotwords, pages, backgrounds, and booksare all separate and distinct objects that have properties which an authorcan alter to change the look and behavior of an object.andP;  Each object hasvarious style characteristics, identifiers, and other properties.andP;  You candefine some properties that are unique to each kind of object, such as afield's border style or a button's label.andP;  The nice thing about ToolBookobjects is that you can change an object's size and move it without affectingother objects on the page, and you can group objects together to size andmove them as a single entity.andP;  You can quickly make new objects by making acopy of an existing object, then modifing the properties of the cloned objectas desired.andP;  Each page consists of a foreground, which holds objects for onlythat page, and a background, which can be shared by more than one page.andM;User interfaceandM;As an author, you use a large assortment of tools for creating and modifyingobjects in ToolBook.andP;  The basic ToolBook user interface consists of severalspecial palettes and about 100 commands normally invoked as menu options froma series of pulldown menus.andP;  Many of the more frequently used commands canalso be invoked by keyboard shortcuts.andP;  The tool palette, which appearswhenever you switch to Author level, contains all the tools needed forcreating objects on ToolBook pages.andP;  ToolBook also provides style palettesfor choosing line style, polygon shape, and patterns for draw objects, andcolor palettes for assigning colors to buttons, fields, and draw objects.andO;These sophisticated color drawing tools can be used to produce excellentcomputer graphics as seen in the accompanying illustrations [omitted].andO;Creation and modification of ToolBook objects is facilitated by a range ofdirect-manipulation techniques such as dragging, lassoing, and rubberbanding.andM;Any ToolBook object can have a script that defines the object's behavior.andO;Scripts are made up of OpenScript statements (similar to HyperTalk scripts).andO;Complex scripts are created with OpenScript, ToolBook's object-orientedscripting language which includes a built-in script editor, syntax checker,and single-step debugger.andP;  ToolBook and OpenScript are extensible through theuse of windows Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs), which can access applicationswritten in various languages including Microsoft C, Pascal or assemblylanguage.andP;  ToolBook developers can also use Windows Dynamic Data Exchange tocommunicate with other Windows applications.andM;Most non-programmers' budding ToolBook careers would be short lived if theyhad to take time out to read and absorb the 600-page Using OpenScript manual.andO;Fortunately, you can use ToolBook's built-in scriptwriting tools to createcertain types of scripts without having to learn OpenScript.andP;  For example,ToolBook's  linking' options for buttons and hotwords make it possible tocreate a navigation script simply by identifying the page you want to branchto when a reader mouse-clicks on the button or hotword.andP;  Additionally,ToolBook's script recorder gives you the ability to record most actionsavailable within ToolBook and automatically translate these actions intoOpenScript statements which can be pasted into a Script window to create anew script or add to an existing script.andP;  Finally, the ToolBook Bookshelf hasa Scripts Notebook which contains script ideas you can use in your ownToolBook applications, including scripts to validate data entry, tomanipulate graphics and color, to create special object and alter menus, andto use sound.andP;  We can expect to sec a flood of useful (and not so useful)ToolBook scripts appearing on BBSs and computer store shelves.andM;While it is obvious that a good deal of thought has gone into the design ofthe user interfaces for the individual tools, the overall feel of the userinterface resembles the stifling feeling one gets when watching thefastidious carpenter skit on the Saturday Night Live TV show.andP;  Too manyfunctions are hidden from view, waiting to be summoned, used, and then neatlytucked away, out of sight in pulldown menus.andP;  Sample interface objects andscripts are also hidden around in different compartments in the ToolBookBookshelf.andP;  Why not provide a user interface with a real world carpenter'stool bench metaphor, where a variety of tools and building block objects arealways visible and ready to be picked up and manipulated? Or better yet,let's revive the Pinball Construction Set approach implemented by ElectronicArts back in the early '80s.andP;  With this construction set, an array of pinballgame graphical objects (i.e., bumpers, flippers, targets, etc.) werepresented for user selection and placement via direct manipulationtechniques.andP;  The user could test the playability of the game at any stage ofdevelopment.andP;  in fact, the approach adopted for the NeXT Interface Builderreminds us of the Pinball Construction Set.andM;PerformanceandM;Based upon our evaluation of ToolBook running on a minimum 286 configurationas well as a 386/25 (8 MB RAM, a Cyrix 25 MHz math coprocessor, and 512K VGAcard), we found that the responsiveness of ToolBook ranges from oftenannoying on a well-endowed 386 computer, to just plain unacceptable on aminimum 286 machine.andP;  For example, it can take as long as 30 seconds to bringeither ToolBook or DayBook to your finger tips after it is selected from theWindows 3.0 desktop.andP;  You can add another 40 seconds to the DayBook accesstime unless you disable the painfully slow animated Asymetrix DayBook logoscreen.andP;  An annoying component of the ToolBook access time is the mandatoryviewing of two interim Asymetrix Logo Screens.andM;Just going between pages in many of the sample applications, includingDayBook, often took up to an unbearable 10 seconds on the 286, and a sluggish4 seconds on the 386 machine.andP;  A delay of a few seconds for a scroll actionto take place after manipulating the scroll bar within the Week View windowis unacceptable.andP;  It is hard to explain some of the performance problemssince our initial set-up adhered to both Windows 3.0 and ToolBook'srecommendations for maximizing performance, including the use of SMART Drive.andO;A chat with a friendly and knowledgeable Asymetrix Technical Supportspecialist indicated that there were no stock cookbook answers to thefrequently fielded questions regarding performance problems.andP;  Through somefine tuning (e.g., disk optimization, buffer handling, color planereductions, etc.) some users have been able to coax out approximately 25%gains in performance.andP;  We understand that Asymetrix is working closely withMicrosoft to improve ToolBook performance.andP;  Maybe a ToolBook compiler is inthe works.andM;ToolBook often displays a disturbing performance-related user interfacecharacteristic which detracts from its overall usability.andP;  Within Windowsapplications, it is customary to give positive feedback that a function hasbeen invoked, and that the user should wait until the function is completed.andO;This is normally done by changing the cursor shape from a pointer to anhour-glass during the busy period, and then back to a pointer upon functioncompletion.andP;  The ToolBook applications which we examined had a tendency toprematurely dismiss the hour-glass cursor, giving the erroneous impressionthat control has been returned to the user.andP;  In addition to creating anunnatural &quot;feel,&quot; there is a tendency to press the mouse button a few timesto determine whether or not the system is ready to accept new inputs.andP;  Thescextraneous mouse clicks are stored up, and can often result in chaos as awhole series of random mouse selections are executed.andP;  It is not clearwhether this is an inherent ToolBook design problem, a by product of theperformance problem, or a lack of appreciation of good user interface designon the part of the first wave of ToolBook developers.andM;ToolBook ApplicationsandM;In addition to the highly publicized packages being developed by ISVs, theapplications and Dynamic Link Libraries (DDLs) supplied with ToolBookprovides valuable insight as to high potential ToolBook application areasthat non-programmer computer users might try to exploit.andP;  The ToolBookBookshelf contains application elements that would appear to support userprogramming in a number of key application areas including PIMs, databasefront-ends, hypermedia courseware, and multimedia.andM;For starters, the DayBook application supplied with Windows 3.0 is a goodexample of the type of worthwhile professional quality PIM application whichToolBook is capable of producing.andP;  DayBook is a graphical PIM that helps youtrack appointments, contacts, and things to do.andP;  It includes a Month View,Weck View, Day View, To Do List and Address Book.andP;  Unlike many HyperCardapplications, DayBook is a complex, fully functional program which supports afull range of input, editing, merging, searching, sorting, and printingfunctions.andP;  It provides several printed reports, including calendar pages anda prioritized to do list.andP;  You can minimize DayBook on the Windows desktop soit is only a click away, and it requires only 1K of RAM when minimized.andM;Asymetrix has also addressed another area which is of particular interest toa large segment of the PC user base by providing a free starter kit forbuilding GUIs for dBase databases.andP;  The ToolBook/Dbase Exchange book providesa ToolBook interface and a special DLL that allow interactive exchange ofdata between ToolBook and dBase files, including the ability to:-Export datafrom ToolBook record fields to a dBase file-Import data from a dBase fileinto an existing ToolBook book-Build a new ToolBook book using data from adBase file, and-Build a browser book to view and update records in a dBasefile while working in ToolBook.andP;  It appears that highly motivated end userswith a good deal of dBase experience will be able to create some usefulapplication custom front-ends with these tools.andM;The hypermedia tutorial and help books supplied with ToolBook demonstrate itscapabilities as an authoring system in a very convincing fashion.andP;  Corporatetrainers and university-level educators who need to develop innovativecourseware rapidly would appear to be among the first non-programming usersto exploit ToolBook's graphics and hypernavigation capabilities.andM;ToolBook's current support for the creation and operation of multimediaapplications involving photo-quality graphics, full-motion video, music,voice, animation, and other special effects on a typical 286/386 PCconfiguration seems fairly primitive.andP;  For example, a majority of PC usershave machines equipped with standard sound capabilities (i.e., a terriblesounding ten-cent speaker).andP;  These users should not expect ToolBook todeliver much in the way of an entertaining range of audio output.andP;  Windowsapplications such as ToolBook make use of the sound device driver to generategenerally irritating tones and sound effects.andP;  However, Asymetrix is workingwith several PC enhancement card suppliers (e.g., Midisoft and VideoLogic) todevelop products with top-notch sound and video capabilities for those whoare able and milling to purchase the necessary add-on boards and software.andO;We see ToolBook playing an important role as the remaining pieces fordeveloping quality multimedia applications on PCs are put into place over thenext few months.andP;  One of the major developments will be the addition of morethan a dozen DLLs to Windows that will perform various multimedia operationsplanned by Microsoft.andM;ToolBook can play a valuable role as a GUI rapid prototyping tool.andO;Functional prototypes built with ToolBook can be used for a &quot;test drive&quot;early in the design cycle to elicit end user feedback.andP;  This feedback can beused to refine the user interface specification, leading to a user interfacewhich is more in tune with users' expectations and capabilities.andP;  ToolBook'svalue as a prototyping tool lies in its ability to allow user interfacedesigners and others with little or no programming experience, but whounderstand application requirements, to participate from the very beginningof the design process.andM;ConclusionsandM;We would hazard a guess that the main feedback that Asymetrix is getting fromits early users can be characterized by-'ToolBook is a potentially greatproduct, but you must make it run much faster!' The early outpouring ofenthusiasm for ToolBook will wane very quickly if asymetrix is not able tosolve its performance problems before the first wave of ToolBook executablesoftware packages start hitting the streets.andP;  Considering the high stakes,and the resources which can be brought to bear on the problem, we areoptimistic about seeing a quick solution.andP;  Indeed, the conclusions thatfollow are predicated upon the assumption that applications created with an'improved' ToolBook are not noticeably different than most Windows 3.0programs in terms of performance.andM;The promise of advanced Object Oriented Programs  OOPS) like ToolBook is thereduction of the time-to-market for software application packages and betterproducts, since end users, with or without programming skills, can play amore active role in shaping products to meet their individual needs.andP;  Thereis little doubt that ToolBook can be used by professional software developersto greatly accelerate and simplify the development of applications that rununder Windows 3.0.andP;  In many cases, individuals at the higher end of theprogramming aptitude and skills spectrum will be able to fully exploitToolBook and related Windows 3.0 capabilities to create complex applicationprograms without writing a single line of programming code.andP;  The mainchallenge for today's crop of DOS developers using ToolBook is one ofavoiding the misuse of the newly found graphics capabilities, while stillvisualizing the possibilities for creating new multimedia forms ofhuman-computer interaction.andP;  Lack of knowledge regarding the principles ofgood GUI design can easily lead to the overuse and misuse of color,bewildering icons, and the second coming of the &quot;button-gone-mild&quot; syndrome(i.e., the unimaginative and excessive use of on-screen buttons as functionkey replacements) associated with the early HyperCard programs and attemptsto add GUIs to DOS programs.andM;Although we are not likely to see many non-programmer ToolBook users creatingbest-seller software packages, ToolBook does allow those at the lower end ofthe programming skills spectrum to achieve more than they could with thepre-Windows 3.0 generation CASE tools.andP;  Practically any motivated computeruser will be able to modify the user interface of an existing ToolBookapplication to make it better fit their needs.andP;  The knowledge required toaffect such modifications will most likely come from informal show-and-tellsessions given by a ToolBook enthusiast, rather than self-study or formaltraining.andP;  ToolBook fits in nicely with our previously stated view that themain market for the current generation of OOP tools is in companies within-house staff capable of developing the initial application program, leavingend users to concentrate on customizing the user interface to make it moreexactly match the way they like to work.andM;Perhaps the most immediate and profound impact ToolBook will have on theprofessional computing world will be one of luring many leading Macintoshsoftware developers into the PC world.andP;  Even the most indoctrinated Macevangelist will be tempted to share in the lucrative market created by thecombination of a flood of relatively inexpensive 286/386 machines, theWindows 3.0 operating environment, and advanced GUI application softwaredevelopment tools such as ToolBook.andP;  After all, with Windows 3.0, they willnot have to give up their beliefs regarding the sanctity of the pulldownmenu, the icon, and the holy mouse.andP;  In the short term, ToolBook, with itssimilarities to HyperCard, mill be responsible for an abundance of HyperCardports from a two and one-half years' reservoir of stacks.andP;  Unfortunately, alot of time-wasters will be pulled from the reservoir.andP;  However, in thelonger run, the attraction of Mac developers, with more experience ingraphical application development than their DOS counterparts, will result inthe very best money can buy software products for the Windows and OS/2(Asymetrix is working on an OS/2 version of ToolBook) user communities.andM;In summary, ToolBook should be viewed as a foundation upon which additionalproducts from Asymetrix and others will build to enable a more creative andproductive interaction between software developers and end users.andP;  WhileToolBook has established itself as the early front runner in what is sure tobe a crowded field of Windows 3.0 CASE tools, we can expect to see otherproducts jockeying for position very shortly.andP;  The bundling of the runtimeversion of ToolBook with Windows 3.0 gives it an enormous marketingadvantage.andP;  However, we will be keeping an eye on Spinnaker Plus, AuthorwareProfessional, Whitewater's Actor, KnowledgePro Windows, and Matrix layout,just to mention a few.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
