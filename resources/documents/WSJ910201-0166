Mr. Ibrahim often serves as the eyes and earsfor Saddam. He was a mute member of the Iraqi delegation atthe Geneva talks between Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz andSecretary of State James Baker, but on this occasion,according to friends who have talked to participants in themeeting, he also spoke.   As is customary in such high-level conversations, Mr.Ibrahim and the Iranians began by presenting their respectiveanalyses of the situation, and both sides agreed that therewould be no war in the Gulf, despite the very tough Americanrhetoric. Nonetheless, Mr. Ibrahim said, it was necessary toconsider what would happen if, despite their expectations,war did break out. What would the Iranian position be? WouldIran join Iraq in a holy war against the infidels? And evenif Iran decided not to enter the war, would it cooperate withIraq in other ways?</LP><TEXT>   Iran will do nothing counter to the United Nationsresolutions, Mr. Ibrahim was told.   Would that position change if Israel entered the war?   The Iranians answered that they would then have to studythe situation; it was impossible to give a definitive answerat the present time.   Mr. Ibrahim insisted: Can we reach some specificagreements? Would it be acceptable, for example, to sendprivate Iraqi airplanes to Iran to escape damage?   Private airplanes would be accepted.   And what about warplanes? Would they, too, be welcome?   The Iranians stated that any Iraqi warplanes landing inIran during a war would be seized and held for the durationof the conflict. Iran, they said, could not be used as astaging area for military actions.   Just three weeks later, more than 100 Iraqi aircraft haveescaped the relentless coalition bombardment and sought safehaven in Iran, and, just as Izzat Ibrahim was told, thewarplanes have apparently been blocked in Iran.   It may be that Saddam believes he can eventually drag Iraninto the war, and is using his air force as a lever to pryPresident Rafsanjani and his colleagues away from theirstance of resolute neutrality. Or it may be that thecommanders of the Iraqi Air Force, shaken by the summaryexecution of their leaders in the first days of the war, andthen faced with the systematic destruction of their aircraftboth on the ground and in the skies, decided to salvage someplanes for better days ahead. Either way, it is a measure oftheir desperation that so many Iraqis are seeking refugeamong their mortal Persian enemies. Recent informationsuggests that the trend is growing: The customs chief and thedirector of the port in the city of Basra have both crossedover into Iran in recent days.   The Iranians must view the events of the past six monthswith a mixture of wonder and bemusement. As recently as lastsummer, the Iranians were still gnashing their teeth overtheir humiliating defeat at the hands of Saddam Hussein.Since then, Saddam has surrendered the territory he wonduring the Iran-Iraq War, and he is now courting Iranianfavors. With this drastic reversal of roles, Iran is onceagain a player in the Great Game, even to the point of beingable to contemplate territorial acquisitions of its own onceIraq has been defeated. The arrival of the cream of the IraqiAir Force is just one more sign that Allah, so recently acruel master, has decided to be generous to his Shi'afaithful in the Islamic Republic.   In short, Iran will be seated at the table when the newMiddle Eastern order is designed at war's end, and it willnot be easy for the U.S. to know how to deal with it. Forthere is no country in the world that American diplomats haveshunned so totally, indeed avoided so compulsively, as Iran.We have done so primarily for political reasons; ever sincethe Iran-Contra affair, no American leader has wished to becaught talking to an Iranian, even though many recognized themany sound geopolitical reasons for dealing with Iran.   As always, when domestic politics overwhelm serious policyconcerns, we are now paying a price for our errors. For justwhen we need good information from the Iranians (Why are someIraqi planes shuttling back and forth? Have the Sovietssecretly been supplying the Iraqis, in violation of the U.N.embargo?) and when we need to comuunicate clearly andreliably with Iranian leaders, we can speak only throughthird parties, with profound suspicion on both sides.   It would have been wiser to have dealt with the Iraniansearlier, but we now have little choice in the matter. Ourcontacts will surely increase, and President Rafsanjani andcompany will likely sit at the postwar negotiating table,thereby producing the great historical irony that SaddamHussein, the conqueror of Persia, will have forced us toresume sensible relations with a reemerging Iran.   ---   Mr. Ledeen, who was an intermediary between Iran and theReagan White House in 1985, is now at the American EnterpriseInstitute.
