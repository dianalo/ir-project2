Eventually, a young Chinese girl withstraight hair, simply clad in white shirt and baggy bluepants, intoned: &quot;Australian businessman.&quot; A beefy, red-facedman lifted himself from the sofa to follow her. Then, atregular intervals, she returned, summoning in turn &quot;Britishdiplomat,&quot; &quot;American journalist&quot; and other visitors to theCelestial Kingdom, each neatly slotted into his own category.   Such was the state of China travel in the 1970s, whenvirtually all visitors, including this writer, had to take atrain from Hong Kong to Lowu, walk across a wooden bridge,luggage in hand, to be processed in Shenzhen, on the otherside of the border. The train to Canton (now Guangzhou) wasin the afternoon and lunch was served while the travelerswaited.</LP><TEXT>   For those going on to Peking, an overnight stay in Cantonwas &quot;de rigeur&quot;. Only the next day could they catch a CAAC(Civil Aviation Administration of China) flight to thecapital.   These are the days remembered in &quot;Bulls in the China Shop&quot;(Pantheon, 330 pages, $25) by Randall E. Stross, anoften-droll description of &quot;how business was done (or notdone) in the years that followed China's opening in the late1970s.&quot; It closes with a discussion of advertising andconsumerism in China.   While Mr. Stross, who lived in China as a graduate studentfrom 1979 to 1981, disclaims any attempt to write &quot;acomprehensive history of Sino-American business ties,&quot; heoffers as much as any layperson would want to know about whathappened when &quot;the world's largest socialist country began todo business with the world's largest capitalist country.&quot;   This is a worthwhile book, which sheds light not only onChinese but also on Americans. It is a little slow in takingoff, but after it does, Mr. Stross offers genuine insightsinto the way Chinese think and operate. In addition, Mr.Stross analyzes why Americans, who initially romanticizedChina as &quot;a business Shangri-la,&quot; with no corruption, lowlabor costs and a huge consumer market, ended up beingwilling to tolerate inefficiency, high costs and corruptionthat they would not have stood for in any other country.   The book is chock full of anecdotes, many of them culledfrom a variety of American publications, in particular backissues of China Business Review; they amuse while sheddinglight on practical problems. China's propensity to relieveforeigners of their money is illustrated by a story of anAmerican fined for her part in a traffic accident. A Chinesepoliceman held her &quot;ten percent responsible&quot; when a bicycleplowed into the side of her car while she was stopped at anintersection.   Baffled at being held responsible at all, she explainedthat she had been sitting in a stopped car. &quot;Yes,&quot; thepoliceman replied politely, &quot;but if you hadn't been in China,this never would have happened.&quot;   In another vignette, a Chinese official, responding to acomplaint by the American negotiator about having to make an$80 million investment without any certainty of being able torecover the money if the Beijing government should happen tofrustrate the deal, replied with a smile: &quot;Capitalists takerisks. We're Socialists.&quot;   &quot;Bulls in a China Shop&quot; also discusses other phenomenaobserved by anyone based in Beijing in those days, such asthe disproportionate number of women who headed theoperations of American companies in China in the 1980s andthe difficulties encountered by ethnic Chinese employees ofAmerican companies. Mr. Stross makes the interesting pointthat knowledge of the Chinese language could be a handicap toa foreign executive, since it often caused the person to bemistaken for a lowly translator.   On the serious side, Mr. Stross examines the Chinesebelief that the basic nature of their socialist system wouldnot be affected by piecemeal adoption of capitalistinstitutions, management models and incentive systems.   The wrongness of that belief was made plain for the worldto see in the weeks leading up to June 4, 1989, when hundredsof thousands of students and ordinary residents of Beijingdemonstrated in Tiananmen Square demanding greateraccountability and an end to official corruption.   But Mr. Stross is undoubtedly right in asserting that theinstant popularity of certain products, such as Coca-Cola andfast food, does not necessarily reflect a yearning forAmerican-style democracy.   Thus, he says, the purchase of a meal at Kentucky FriedChicken was not necessarily a vote of solidarity for &quot;America-- Catch the Spirit&quot;; it was a vote for a meal of chicken andpotatoes, and a vote against the dismal alternativesavailable to the Chinese consumer: noisy, crowded, dirtyestablishments that offered service with a snarl. That makesbelievable the words used by a Chinese reporter who describedthe KFC restaurant as a place &quot;of psychological rest,relaxing the nerves, providing people with a place of peaceand comfort amid the din of the city.&quot;   ---   Mr. Ching, the Journal's correspondent in China from 1979to 1983, is a free-lance writer based in Hong Kong.</TEXT></DOC>
