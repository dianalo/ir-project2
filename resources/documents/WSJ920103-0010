But much of that goes down the drain when shareholders seea dead seal dumped in Bayer's driveway as a protest that thecompany is allegedly poisoning the North Sea.</LP><TEXT>   Since 1983, the German chemical and pharmaceuticalsconcern has learned to expect that sort of thing from anenvironmentalist group called Coordination Against BayerDangers. The group itself owns shares in Bayer; thus, itsmembers can claim the microphone at annual shareholdersmeetings. The group also distributes fliers, publishes ananti-Bayer newspaper and circulates petitions year roundagainst the multinational company.   &quot;But the annual shareholders meeting is the Olympics forthem -- the high point of their year,&quot; says Wido Mosen, aBayer spokesman who spends a major part of his time fendingoff the group. The group once gave Bayer's chairman an animalintestine supposedly filled with the blood of people killedby alleged dioxin poisoning from Bayer factories. Bayer hadthe specimen analyzed and found that it really contained oxblood, Mr. Mosen says.   The group, whose avowed purpose is to make life difficultfor Bayer, defines itself as a self-help network of peopleeither interested in Bayer or injured by its operations.Stemming originally from a community action group founded in1978 after an accident at a Bayer plant in Wuppertal,Germany, the group was registered as an official associationin 1983. Today, the group claims 5,000 &quot;cooperation partners&quot;around the world who follow Bayer's activities with acritical, environmentally conscious eye.   But often, the group's agenda strays from the path of pureenvironmentalism. One year, instead of a dead animal, thegroup brought a model of a gilded calf to the shareholdersmeeting to protest the company's pursuit of profit allegedlyat the expense of both the environment and workers' safety.   &quot;They pass themselves off as devout environmentalists, butthey clearly have a political, ideological agenda,&quot; Mr. Mosenmaintains. He says that many of the group's board membersbelonged to the German Communist Party and that the groupreceived financial support from the party.   Regina Guenter, manager of Coordination Against BayerDangers, confirms that many of the founding members used tobelong to the Communist Party, but she adds that members alsocome from a broad spectrum of other political parties andchurch organizations. Ms. Guenter denies that the groupreceived support or directions from the party.   &quot;It's unbelievable that Bayer is still dredging up thesereproaches of communism,&quot; Ms. Guenter says. &quot;It was an easyway for Bayer to try to discredit us by preying on thepopular fear of communists.&quot; She adds: &quot;Certainly, we'repolitically involved and active, but what organizationisn't?&quot;   Bayer was particularly irked by a 1987 statement in whichthe group accused the company of injuring democraticprinciples, human rights and political fairness &quot;in itslimitless quest for gain and profit.&quot; The statement furthercharged that &quot;unpopular critics are spied upon and put underpressure; conservative and elevated politicians are supportedand financed.&quot;   Bayer sued for defamation, and after two stages of appealin 1987 and 1988, succeeded in having the group barred frompublishing such statements. But just last week, it wasannounced that a Karlsruhe court overturned the earlierfindings, ruling that such statements are protected underGermans' right to free speech.   Coordination Against Bayer Dangers says its primary goalis to provide more information about Bayer's world-wideoperations and to call for more protection of both theenvironment and company workers. The group also pushes forBayer to stop producing materials it considers harmful and toadopt production methods that &quot;don't only look at the size ofthe market but also take other social criteria into account,&quot;says Ellen Frings, a member of the group.</TEXT></DOC>
