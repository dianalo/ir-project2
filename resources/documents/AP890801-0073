Hans-Juergen Foerster, spokesman for the Federal Prosecutor'sOffice in Karlsruhe, said the kidnappers have also demandedtelephone contact with the two Hamadi brothers and that they beplaced in the same prison.   Foerster told The Associated Press that the demands were relayedto the West German Embassy in Beirut, but he did not indicate whenor how.   Rainer Mueller, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry in Bonn,refused to comment on Foerster's remarks.   Thomas Kemptner and Heinrich Struebig were kidnapped near Sidon,Lebanon, on May 16. Both are employees of the West German relieforganization Asme-Humanitas.   No one has claimed responsibility for kidnapping the 28-year-oldKemptner and Struebig, 48. Asme-Humanitas officials said today theyhad not been informed of any demands.   Foerster said ``the kidnappers, who have not previously linkedthe hostage-taking with demands, now through the West GermanEmbassy in Beirut have set as their conditions ... the release of... Abbas Ali Hamadi and Mohammed Ali Hamadi.''   There have been previous reports that the kidnappings werelinked to the Hamadi case.   A day after the two relief workers disappeared, Mohammed Hamadiwas sentenced to life in prison on murder and air piracy charges bya court in Frankfurt for the 1985 TWA hijacking in which a U.S.Navy diver was killed.   His brother, Abbas Hamadi, is serving a 13-year prison term foran April 1988 conviction on charges he helped kidnap two WestGerman businessmen in a 1987 attempt to force the release of hisbrother.   The two businessmen were subsequently released.</TEXT></DOC>
