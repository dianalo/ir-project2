Alitalia also has taken options on a further 20 of the jetliners, stretched versions of the European consortium's A-320 short-to-medium distance aircraft. The first A-321s are scheduled to fly in 1994.    Iberia also has converted seven of its options for A-320 jets into firm orders, Airbus said.    Airbus said the eight A-321s ordered by Iberia cost a total of $360 million, or about $45 million a plane. It declined to value Alitalia's order, but taking the figure of $48 million that industry sources say is the asking price of an A-321, it would be worth $960 million.    Airbus said the latest orders bring the total to 60 firm orders for the A-321 and 25 options. The consortium previously said it would need 40 firm orders for the A-321 before launching construction.    Airbus is a consortium of Aerospatiale of France, Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm G.m.b.H. of West Germany, British Aerospace PLC and Construcciones Aeronauticas S.A. of Spain. </TEXT></DOC>
