Questioned about his part in the subsequent Iran-Contraaffair, Mr. Gates testified that the weapon sales were drivenby an &quot;arms-for-hostages&quot; strategy that was aimed at winningrelease of U.S. hostages held in the Middle East but wasshaped more by Israeli than U.S. intelligence. Mr. Gatesemphasized that he was expressing only his personal opinionbut, as President Bush's nominee to head the CentralIntelligence Agency, his blunt assessment is significant inreflecting White House attitudes.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;These guys were not making policy based on what U.S.intelligence was providing them,&quot; said Mr. Gates Friday,referring to early judgments by then-National SecurityAdviser Robert McFarlane. &quot;Mr. McFarlane's discussions withIsraeli officials during the summer of 1985 . . . led to thelater events.&quot;   In the aftermath of the Iran-Contra operations -- in whichmoney from the sale of the arms was to be diverted to aidanti-government Contra rebels in Nicaragua -- Mr. Bush alsohas emphasized Israel's influence over U.S. policy makers.But critics argue that both the president and Mr. Gates usedJerusalem to disguise their own misjudgments. While there islittle doubt of Israel's role, the &quot;arms-for-hostages&quot;strategy was known to the White House and CIA, where analystsworked with the National Security Council to develop anintelligence paper justifying the arms sales as an attempt tocounter Soviet influence in Tehran.   Mr. McFarlane asked for the CIA estimate immediately afteran NSC consultant, Michael Ledeen, returned from highlevelmeetings on Iran with Israeli officials in May 1985. Yetdocuments released for the first time by the SenateIntelligence Committee show that a week before Mr. Ledeen'sreturn, a senior CIA analyst had already circulated a memosaying there would be &quot;much benefit&quot; if the U.S. permittedarms shipments from other Western sources, including Israel,for Iran.   Mr. Gates, then head of the CIA's intelligence division,was privy to that memo and the fact that its author, GrahamFuller, was then given responsibility for the new Iranianestimate requested by the NSC. Mr. Fuller testified that heinvoked Mr. Gates's name in a game of &quot;hardball&quot; withlower-level analysts who objected to portions of thesubsequent paper. And Mr. Gates has acknowledged he used hisposition directly to persuade someone at the State Departmentto refrain from objecting to the estimate.   After three weeks of hearings, the Intelligence panel mustsort out conflicts in the record before its scheduled Oct. 18vote on Mr. Gates's confirmation. Apart from the Iran-Contraaffair, allegations of low morale and the politicization ofintelligence during his tenure in the CIA's top managementare a concern. Both issues go to questions of the nominee'sintegrity and willingness to stand up to superiors.   Republicans remain loyal to Mr. Gates, but by failing tobe more impartial, they have diminished their effectivenessin swaying judgments on him. Together with theadministration, the GOP members devoted much of their capitalin the early stages of the hearings to suppressing questionsregarding the Iran-Contra affair. When the politicizationissue arose later, they were stunned by the emotions itgenerated and poorly positioned to take advantage ofcontradictions in testimony by Mr. Gates's critics.   The Democrat who seems most sympathetic to argumentspresented by the Republicans is California Sen. AlanCranston. The former party whip sometimes crossed the hearingroom to privately discuss matters with Sen. Warren Rudman,and he has expressed respect for questioning by the NewHampshire Republican. Although denying any connection, Mr.Cranston is the subject of an ethics case in which Mr.Rudman, as vice chairman of the Senate Ethics Committee, willplay a part in deciding what punishment will be recommendedfor the Democrat's role in the socalled Keating Fivesavings-and-loan scandal.   More important for Democrats outside the IntelligenceCommittee will be the positions taken by Chairman David Boren(D., Okla.) and by Sen. Sam Nunn (D., Ga.). Mr. Boren warmlypraised Mr. Gates's cooperation with the panel in remarksFriday, but Mr. Nunn's questioning reflected continuedconcern about the nominee's failure to be more of a check onhis benefactor, the late CIA Director William Casey.   &quot;Mr. Casey did not draw as bright a line as he should havein terms of his own role between providing intelligence andtrying to influence the policies,&quot; Mr. Gates acknowledged.   &quot;Did you ever go back and tell the president that? `Watchout for Mr. Casey . . . We have to pull him back all thetime'?&quot; Mr. Nunn asked. &quot;No, sir,&quot; Mr. Gates answered, &quot;and Idon't think either one of my predecessors did either.&quot;   In fact, testimony before congressional Iran-Contracommittees shows that Mr. Gates's predecessor, John McMahon,expressed opposition to the Iran initiative directly toPresident Reagan at a meeting at the White House residence inDecember 1985. Mr. McMahon was sitting in for Mr. Casey and,according to the committees' later report, argued that thelong-term rationale of moderating Iran through arms sales wasfaulty. &quot;McMahon was convinced that all of this was anarms-for-hostage arrangement, no matter what you called it,&quot;the report said.</TEXT></DOC>
