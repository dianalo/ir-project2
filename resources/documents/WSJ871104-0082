BarrettStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 11/04/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> TX PZLBANKRUPTCIES (BCY)PETROLEUM (PET)SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR) </IN><TEXT>   Federal securities laws may provide Texaco Inc. with its best strategy for convincing the U.S. Supreme Court to review the company's $10.3 billion defeat in Texas state court.    Although the dispute with Pennzoil Co. turns primarily on state contract law, federal appellate lawyers and legal scholars suggest that Texaco might entice the high court to intervene by taking the offensive, charging Pennzoil with violating federal law in its unsuccessful bid for Getty Oil Co.    But that strategy would be a long shot, experts believe, and its prospects for success would depend heavily on support from the Securities and Exchange Commission, which earlier filed a brief with the Texas Supreme Court backing some Texaco arguments.    The U.S. Supreme Court is the last forum in which Texaco could reverse Pennzoil's landmark judgment against the White Plains, N.Y.-based company. But in order to receive a hearing from the high court, Texaco will have to convince four justices that the case involves important issues of federal law.    &quot;This is, after all, primarily a state court matter . . . and the Supreme Court justices will look skeptically for (grounds for) federal jurisdiction,&quot; said Erwin Griswold, a former U.S. solicitor general and Harvard Law School dean who now practices in Washington.    Mr. Griswold predicted that, in seeking Supreme Court review, Texaco would reiterate securities-law arguments made in Texas. Chief among these is the allegation that Pennzoil violated SEC rules by offering favorable treatment to certain Getty shareholders outside of the formal Pennzoil tender offer for Getty.    Rex Lee, another former solicitor general who now practices law in Washington, said the allegation is the &quot;kind of solid federal ground&quot; Texaco will need, although he said he didn't have an opinion on the merits of the charge.    The SEC has already supported Texaco's position on the issue in a friend-of-the-court brief that urged the Texas Supreme Court to review the case. If the agency, together with the Justice Department, backs Texaco's expected petition for U.S. Supreme Court review, it would greatly increase the company's chances of being heard.    An SEC official said the agency hasn't yet decided whether it will urge the high court to hear Texaco's appeal. But the official points out that the justices traditionally agree to hear 60% to 70% of cases in which the federal government recommends review.    Pennzoil has hotly disputed the relevance of Texaco's securities-law charge to the larger dispute over whether Texaco illegally interfered with Pennzoil's agreement to buy an interest in Getty Oil. Pennzoil also argues that former Getty Oil shareholders alone have any standing to assert the issue, and Texaco wasn't a Getty shareholder at the time of the events in question.    Texaco can also be expected to ask the Supreme Court to rule on several constitutional attacks the company has made against the Texas courts. Among these is the charge that Texas judges misapplied relevant laws of other states. Also, Texaco will likely complain that it was denied &quot;due process&quot; because of alleged conflicts of interest on the part of a Texas trial court judge and numerous alleged improper rulings at the four-and-a-half month trial.    Neither of these arguments, however, is likely on its own to sway the Supreme Court, according to legal experts. &quot;The notion that you didn't get due process because (lower court judges) didn't agree with you isn't likely to do the trick,&quot; said Alan Morrison, a prominent Supreme Court litigator who heads Public Citizen Litigation Group in Washington. Mr. Morrison cautioned, however, that he hasn't studied the Texaco-Pennzoil case closely.    Regardless of the principles involved, the sheer size of the judgment against Texaco may attract the Supreme Court's attention. The high court agreed to hear an earlier Texaco appeal of an important procedural matter in the case, ruling unanimously at that time in Pennzoil's favor.    The Supreme Court's rules don't officially favor big-money cases. But &quot;as a practical matter,&quot; the justices are &quot;more likely&quot; to take a close look at a mammoth judgment such as the one against Texaco, said Bartow Farr, a prominent appellate litigator in Washington. &quot;It sharpens the focus of the risks involved.&quot;    Richard Fallon, a Harvard law professor who studies federal jurisdiction issues, agreed that some justices might be fascinated by the heft of the Texaco penalty. But he pointed out that in Texaco's first trip to the Supreme Court, several justices specifically rejected the idea that multibillion-dollar corporations or transactions deserve special judicial attention. </TEXT></DOC>
