Current methodologiesfor analysis of these proteins (e.g:dextran-coated charcoal, DCC) insingle-label assay (SLA) require relatively large amounts of tissue material,time and laboriousness. Therefore, the authors have developed for breastcancer tissue an improved dual-label assay (DLA) for simultaneous titration(by DCC) and/or characterization (by sedimentation properties) of ERand PgR on the same sample, using *H1*H2*H5I-E*L2 and *H3H-Org 2058 astracers. The interaction of *H1*H2*H5I-E*L2 with ER and plasma proteinsin comparison to *H3H-E*L2 was studied in terms of specificity, timecourse, affinity binding and sedimentation pattern. *H1*H2*H5I-E*L2 boundthe same molecular forms displayed by *H3H-E*L2 (9 and 3S) but with lowertiters (about 1.3-fold), irrespective of the technique used, and didnot bind to sex hormone-binding globulin. Simultaneous detection of *H1*H2*H5Iand *H3H was achieved by use of a gamma counter plus a beta counter sequentially.ER and PgR titrations with DCC in DLA were in good agreement with thoseobtained with SLA, in terms of titers and Ka values. An analogous resultswas obtained with sucrose density gradient (SDG) analysis. Both the DLAmethods were highly reproducible (CVandless;8.0%). Between the rotors availablefor SDG, the vertical one was preferable because of the larger numberof samples processed and of less purturbation of sedimenting receptormolecules. Furthermore, a biochemical applications of the method is described.In conclusion, the DLA procedure, by simplifying ER and PgR estimation,makes it possible to study, even on small tumor biopsies, the molecularproperties of these proteins in relation to the clinical response ofthe disease. 25 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
