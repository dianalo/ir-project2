In a letter they have drafted for delivery to President Reagan tomorrow, the senators say they want to tie tariff reductions granted in the pact by the U.S. to certain Canadian promises, including the elimination of Canadian natural-resource subsidies that the pact leaves untouched.    An administration trade official said, &quot;I really, really doubt if that would fly with the Canadians.&quot; If the Western senators stick to their position, the White House may be forced either to press Canada to reopen the agreement on subsidies Ottawa considers sacrosanct, or face a Senate revolt that could jeopardize approval of the legislation needed to implement the pact.    The senators' challenge could also make it politically tough for other Western politicians, including House members and governors, to support the agreement as it stands. The National Governors' Association is expected to vote on it tomorrow.    Sen. Max Baucus (D., Mont.), who with Sen. Pete Domenici (R., N.M.) organized the letter, said in an interview, &quot;We think it's fine for the East, it's good for financial interests and manufacturing. But it doesn't help the industries important to our region, like non-ferrous metals, coal, plywood, uranium, wheat.&quot;    He added that &quot;if these problems aren't addressed, I'll be forced to oppose the agreement, and I believe that's the view of a good number of others in the group.&quot;    Sen. Baucus's office said that as many as 20 senators are expected to sign the letter, including Alan Simpson (R., Wyo.), the No. 2 GOP leader; Malcolm Wallop (R., Wyo.); Orrin Hatch (R., Utah); Dennis DeConcini (D., Ariz.), and Frank Murkowski (R., Alaska).    The accord won't be submitted to the Senate as a treaty, requiring two-thirds approval. Instead, both the House and Senate will vote on legislation implementing the pact. Under special &quot;fast-track&quot; rules, the bill will require only majority approval and must be voted on without amendments within 90 legislative days of its submission.    Administration officials privately concede that the pact doesn't stop Canadian subsidies that are the bane of the natural resource industries, but they point out that companies can still act against Canada under the trade laws. They have privately expected to lose some Western votes, but hope to discourage key Republicans, such as Sens. Simpson and Domenici, from actively leading opposition.    The administration will try to satisfy congressional gripes by fashioning language that is politically acceptable, but not so tough as to require new confrontations with Canada that might sink the pact. The White House wants to ward off any rule changes that would permit crippling amendments.    The draft letter expresses the hope that language can be worked out to meet the West's concerns. But it warns against leaving senators with &quot;no alternative short of amending the fast-track process or opposing the agreement outright.&quot; In addition to pledges to end subsidies on metals, coal and wheat, the senators want restrictions lifted on U.S. plywood imports; protection for the U.S. uranium industry from Canadian imports made likelier under the pact, and U.S. regulatory changes in the pricing of Canadian natural gas. </TEXT></DOC>
