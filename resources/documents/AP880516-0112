Jesse Jackson, still in the Democratic racethough trailing badly, renewed his call for fairness in choosingdelegates.   Meanwhile, a new poll showed Democrat Michael Dukakis ahead ofRepublican Bush in a trial heat between the likely nominees. Nearlysix months before the general election, according to a Harris poll,Dukakis was favored by 50 percent of likely voters who weresurveyed, Bush was supported by 43 percent and 7 percent wereundecided.   The survey of 2,138 people had a 3 percentage-point margin ofpotential sampling error.   Robertson, who had not been a major GOP contender for twomonths, ended his campaigning officially in a brief meeting withreporters in front of his home on the grounds of CBN University inVirginia Beach, Va.   He had dropped his operating control of the ChristianBroadcasting Network to run for president and said today he would``resume the leadership of CBN tomorrow.''   ``Today I suspend my candidacy for the Republican nomination in1988 but I do not now nor will I ever suspend my advocacy ofconservative and moral principles,'' he said. ``George Bush has wonthe nomination. I applaud his magnificent effort and warmly endorsehis candidacy.''   He said he had filed incorporation papers for Americans for theRepublic, a group to be used as ``a rallying point for futurepolitical action.'' But he said of his own possible candidacy in1992, ``That remains a moot question until the 1988 election. Ihope Mr. Bush is elected and then re-elected again in 1992.''   Jackson, at a breakfast appearance today in Newark, N.J., calledagain for party officials and other ``super delegates'' to supporthim in greater numbers, taking into account his support inprimaries this year and also his past efforts helping otherDemocratic candidates and bringing in new voters.   ``We hope to have enough popular vote and delegates'' to win thenomination, he said. But win or lose, he added, ``fairness is areasonable expectation. Reciprocity is a reasonable expectation. Weexpect to treat the party fair because we expect to be treatedfairly by the party.''   Jackson and Dukakis will face off Tuesday in the Oregon primary,with 45 delegates at stake.   An upbeat Dukakis, addressing Democrats in New Jersey on Sunday,declared: ``I smell victory in the air.'' But Jackson, turning atale of pride and perseverance into a campaign parable, urgedcollege students in Virginia, ``Keep hope alive.''   Following what has become a pattern in recent contests, Jacksonwas engaging in primary-eve campaigning today, while Dukakis washome in Massachusetts devoting the day to gubernatorial business.   Up until today, Robertson was the sole Republican remaining inthe race against Bush. Pete du Pont, Alexander Haig, Jack Kemp andBob Dole all fell by the wayside as Bush rolled up aninsurmountable lead.   The vice president clinched the delegates needed to nominatelast month, in the Pennsylvania primary, and got President Reagan'sformal endorsement last week.   Robertson, who has 46 delegates to Bush's 1,344, finally facedfacts last week. He told reporters then he was backing Bush andwould make his own exit official today. He was expected to turn hisdelegates over to Bush at the Republican National Convention thissummer.   Robertson had not been considered a serious contender sinceSuper Tuesday, March 8, when his bid to make a strong Southernshowing fizzled abysmally.   The former television evangelist had come out swinging in thefirst real campaign contest. In Iowa's much-watched caucuses onFeb. 8, he stunned the Bush forces with a second-place finish _behind Dole, but ahead of the vice president.   Robertson soldiered on even after it became obvious that thenomination was out of his reach. He encouraged his backers to seekstate party office and promised to use his clout to shape theRepublican platform.   ``There is an enterprise the Lord set me on a year or so ago _running for president,'' he told a Denver congregation last month.   ``Out of what seems to be a defeat we are laying a foundationfor a great victory for this nation. It may not be in 1988 ... butI am not going to quit. ... That is His plan for me and for thisnation,'' he said.   Bush spent most of Sunday rafting on Oregon's Rogue River. Hedid a little fishing too, but said he didn't catch anything.   The vice president was starting off the day today in Washingtonstate, where Robertson won a straw poll on Super Tuesday. Bushattended a Seattle fund-raiser on Sunday night.   Jackson and Dukakis crossed paths on the campaign trail Sunday,when both made appearances at New Jersey's state Democraticconvention. The two held a brief meeting, which Dukakis describedas ``warm, pleasant, respectful.''   Dukakis predicted a Democratic win in the fall, and although hedidn't directly say so, his talk of beating Bush made it clear hedoes not view Jackson as much of an obstacle to the nomination. Bythe latest Associated Press delegate count, Dukakis has 1,610 toJackson's 956.   Jackson, at a rally in Newark on Sunday, said, ``No valley istoo deep when our minds are made up. We've come too far to turnaround now.''   The New Jersey and California primaries, along with same-daycontests in Montana and New Mexico, close the Democratic primaryseason.</TEXT></DOC>
