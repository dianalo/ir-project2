(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   New Jersey election officials hopemore presidential hopefuls will drop out before the state'sprimary, or they will be forced to rent voting machines toaccommodate crowded ballots.   Although it is likely that some candidates will fall before thestate's primary June 7, ``New Jersey clerks can't afford to sitaround and wait,'' said Atlantic County Clerk Lori Mooney.   Monmouth County Clerk Jane Clayton is not so sure that thepresidential slate will get any smaller.   ``It's so easy for them to get matching federal funds today thatthey're just not as encouraged to drop out,'' she said.   Fitting the entire slate of those seeking the Republican andDemocratic presidential nominations on the ballot _ pluscongressional, senate and convention delegate candidates _ will benearly impossible, most county clerks say.   Many county clerks in New Jersey already have arranged to rentmachines from other states to give each party a machine of its ownat every polling site, Ms. Clayton said.   ``That places on unconscionable burden on taxpayers,'' she said.</TEXT><HEAD>Three Democrats and Two Republicans Tied in Maryland Poll</HEAD><DATELINE>BALTIMORE, Md.

Bob Dole, while the Democratic contest is a three-wayvirtual dead heat, according to a poll by the Baltimore Sun.   Rep. Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, who was far behind in aJanuary survey of Marylanders, has surged into contention after hisvictory Monday in the Iowa caucuses. He now holds a slim lead overMassachusetts Gov.
