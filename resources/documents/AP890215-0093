The relentless rain filled rivers to overflowing, closed roadsand forced the evacuation of a hospital. Although it brought reliefto drought-stricken areas of Tennessee and Texas, for many people itwas too much of a good thing.   ``There have been very few floods people can remember worse thanthis,'' Sen. Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn., said Tuesday night as hetoured hard-hit sections not far from his home in Carthage.   Wilson County, just east of Nashville, was drenched with nearly 6inches of rain. One woman, 62-year-old Sophia Payer, drowned whenshe ignored police warnings not to cross flooded U.S. Highway 231,authorities said.   The rainfall also caused a power outage in the county that forced70 people to be evacuated from a hospital in Lebanon. Schools werecanceled and police reported 80 vehicles stalled on flooded roads.   Thirty people in Cheatham County, northeast of Nashville, wereevacuated early today when the Harpeth River overflowed its banksand flooded 10 homes, said Danny Newton, chief of operations for theTennessee Emergency Management Agency.   Rivers overflowed in central and western Kentucky. Frankfort, thestate capital, was under a flood warning today as the Kentucky Riverexceeded flood stage. The state Division of Disaster and EmergencyServices reported the river was at 31.79 feet at 8 a.m. and rising afoot an hour. Flood stage is 31 feet.   Residents were evacuated along the Green River and Little River,and merchants in New Haven in central Kentucky continued sandbaggingthe banks of the Rolling Fork of the Salt River.   Schools were closed today in at least 16 counties plus Frankfort.The Western Kentucky Parkway, a major east-west artery, was closedbetween Leitchfield and Elizabethtown due to high water.   Many other rivers in Kentucky, Tennessee and Indiana are expectedto flood later in the week as their water levels continue to rise.   Flash flood watches were in effect early today from northeastTexas to southern Ohio, ranging along a line that crossed throughArkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana and West Virginia.   ``The ground is pretty well saturated,'' National Weather Servicemeteorologist Bob Watson said in Paducah, Ky., which received morethan half a foot of rain between midnight Sunday and late Tuesday.   A nun, Sister Robert Edlin of the Sisters of Loretto, was caughtin high water as she drove along Kentucky 605 about 30 milessoutheast of Louisville. Authorities said she was rescued as thewater reached the depth of her dashboard. She was treated athospital in Bardstown for minor hypothermia.   Two people in Kentucky died Monday when their car went out ofcontrol in heavy rain near the Indiana border.   Forecasters in Tennessee said the downpour should end a droughtthat has lingered for four years. Nashville's rainfall for the yearis approaching 9 inches, 3 above normal. The 4.19 inches it receivedTuesday marked the most rain in a 12-hour period during the past 10years, weather officials said.   In west Texas, the storm brought rain to areas that had seen fewdrops since last August.   In Western Mitchell County, east of Big Spring, there werereports of up to 2{ inches of rain Tuesday night. Up to 1{ incheswas measured in the Garden City area between San Angelo and Midland.   ``There are still some pretty fair chances of getting moremoisture,'' said Jim Boyd of the National Weather Service in SanAngelo, Texas, in predicting that the weather system would remain inthe area another 36 to 48 hours.   Nonetheless, meteorologists said it wasn't enough to end adrought that has plagued ranchers and caused dust storms.   ``It's not going to be any better this spring,'' warned BarryLambert of the National Weather Service. ``Just wait until Marchwhen the wind begins blowing.''   Officials speculated Tuesday that the weather may havecontributed to Monday's crash of a helicopter ambulance near Tyler,Texas. The pilot and two nurses died after the copter struck a powerline during a storm.   The heavy rains were caused by the meeting of three weatherfronts _ one carrying warm, wet air northeast from Baja California,one carrying warm tropical air north from the Gulf of Mexico and onekeeping a band of cold air in place across much of the north-centralportions of the United States.   ``It's more typical of an early spring situation,'' said DanMcCarthy, meteorologist with the National Weather Service's SevereStorms Forecast Center in Kansas City, Mo.   Does that mean spring will be early? ``It doesn't mean anythinglike that,'' he said.   In fact, McCarthy said, another frigid blast of arctic air isheading south and should lower temperatures in the northern Plainsto highs of around zero by the weekend.</TEXT></DOC>
