The major elements of the reportinclude: an estimate of urban transportation system characteristics forvarious sizes of cities, an estimate of urban transporation energy consumptionby the various city sizes and the associated national urban energy consumption,taking into account the total number of urban areas, a review of varioustransportation management measures and the associated energy impact,an evaluation of the ten best measures for each city size, and a recommendedprogram of research and development taking into account the potentialenergy savings of the various measures. It was found that the two largestcity size groupings, consisting of approximately 9 urban centres, accountfor over 60% of the national base energy consumption. A summary of thecosts and cost-effectiveness of each of the 23 energy management measuresby each of the city size groupings indicates that with the larger citysizes, the average cost-effectiveness for all of the measures improves.If all of these measures were implemented for all city size groupings,the total urban energy consumption would be reduced by approximately2.7%. If all of the 10 best measures for each city size grouping wereimplemented, the potential annual savings would be approximately 525million litres of fuel. The largest potential savings are in Ontario,the smallest in the Atlantic provinces. Traffic measures account forthe largest potential savings, approximately 70% of the total. 114 refs.,3 figs., 23 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
