The 9mm pistol, called the Z88, was developed for the SouthAfrican police by a subsidiary of the state arms corporation.   South Africa had been able to import pistols despite the armsembargo implemented by the United Nations in 1977, but officialssaid prices were excessive and delivery times often slow.   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok said the new pistol ``stoodhead and shoulders above'' foreign-made models.   Since the embargo was imposed, the weapons industry hasdeveloped into South Africa's most lucrative manufacturing sector,despite attempts by the United Nations to discourage members frombuying South African arms.   Jane's Defense Weekly, the respected British militarypublication, estimated that South Africa earned $900 million lastyear exporting arms to 23 countries.</TEXT></DOC>
