(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Aly El-Shiekh envisions astronauts on athree-year trip to Mars ``knitting'' themselves a space stationusing ceramic fibers that can be braided into panels, beams, boxesand practically any other shape.   ``We believe if they can take the ceramic fibers they need andthe machinery we're developing they would be able to literally makethe space stations they will need as they go,'' said El-Shiekh, amechanical engineer at working in North Carolina State University'stextiles school.   El-Shiekh and his students are developing machinery to braid longstrands of ceramic fibers. Such fibers, bonded with epoxy, also willform heat shields and many of the parts in the vessel that carriespeople to Mars. The parts will withstand speeds of 50,000 mph andtemperatures of at least 4,000 degrees.   While much of his work relates to the Mars Mission ResearchCenter here, El-Shiekh sees a big future for composite materialslike ceramic fibers.   ``The day may very well come when you are driving around with carengine parts of ceramic fiber,'' he said, adding that thevibration-damping properties of the materials also would make themgood for torsion bars in cars.   ``We also are working on the idea of putting this braided fabricin concrete as reinforcing material instead of metal rods,'' hesaid. ``It is stronger than steel, does not rust and would not wearaway _ the road would not deteriorate.''   The fibers, including Kevlar now used to make bulletproof vests,also could be used to make some body parts, and El-Shiekh is workingwith Duke University researchers on ceramic ``stents,'' collapsiblebraces for arteries.   El-Shiekh, who got his degree in mechanical engineering in hisnative Egypt, first saw applications of the ancient art of braidingto space travel in the 1960s when he was at the MassachusettsInstitute of Technology.   ``The monkeys they were sending into space then came back dizzyand they could not understand why. NASA sent us films to try tofigure out why this was happening. What we finally discovered wasthat they were using twisted ropes for the parachute on the capsule.   ``When the parachute opened, the ropes would untwist and thatwould make the capsule spin on the way down. It was the spinningthat made the monkeys dizzy, so we suggested they change to braidedropes.''   El-Shiekh was working in other textile projects until two yearsago when a friend suggested he turn to developing automatedmachinery for ceramic fiber. A year later, NASA began setting upresearch projects on a manned Mars mission and his work in ceramicfibers got their attention.   ``The possibilities are limitless.'' said El-Shiekh, who canproduce shapes ranging from hollow cubes to panels that haveopenings for wiring and conduits already braided into them. ``Thebig problem is cost and that's why we're working on this automatedmachinery.''   Using scrap parts and whatever materials he could find, he hasdesigned and built two computer-operated braiding machines.   ``By hand, we can make an inch of this every hour,'' he said,pointing to a one-inch-square column of braided carbon fiber. ``Withautomation, we can turn out 36 inches every 15 minutes. And we cando it uniformly. Done by hand, there is always a difference in thebraid from person to person.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for March 16</NOTE></DOC>
