The tax package goes to a House-Senate conference today, and lawmakers will attempt to reconcile it with a House-passed bill that would raise $7.1 billion in taxes over three years.    &quot;We have a lot of momentum,&quot; said Sen. Max Baucus after last night's lopsided vote. &quot;All signs are that we will secure a conference agreement this week,&quot; said the Montana Democrat, who managed the bill on the Senate floor.    The Senate bill, approved 87-1, would raise taxes by accelerating estimated tax payments, restricting the sale of tax breaks by Alaskan native corporations, and curbing life insurance policies that can serve as tax shelters. Sen. Bill Bradley (D., N.J.), who criticized the &quot;priorities&quot; of the measure's tax breaks and revenue-losing provisions, cast the only opposing vote.    The revenue-raising provisions in the Senate bill are acceptable to the Reagan administration, especially because they would pay for some sought-after extensions of tax breaks and technical corrections to the 1986 tax-overhaul law. The extensions would be for periods of one year or less.    The House bill, however, would raise additional taxes for, among others, military contractors and corporations that own stock in other corporations. These provisions could prove to be sticking points in a House-Senate conference.    The tax benefits in the Senate bill include:   --Extending the 20% research-and-development tax credit that is scheduled to expire at year end.    --Extending tax breaks for thrifts that rescue troubled thrifts. It would provide the same tax incentive to healthy banks that take over troubled banks as well.    --Extending a tax break for employer-provided education expenses.    --Establishing a taxpayer bill of rights, designed to bolster taxpayers' rights in disputes with the Internal Revenue Service.    --Extending a provision that eases the tax treatment of research-and-development expenses that support foreign operations.    --Extending a credit given to employers who hire economically disadvantaged workers.    --Exempting free-lance writers, artists and some livestock producers from a rule that bars taxpayers from deducting certain production expenses before a project produces income.    --Keeping farmers from having to pay the diesel-fuel highway tax for fuel used off the road.    --Liberalizing the tax credit for low-income housing.    --Allowing families to avoid tax on interest earned on U.S. savings bonds redeemed to pay for college or vocational education.    --Allowing farmers who are forced by drought to sell livestock to delay tax on that income for a year. It also would allow farmers who received drought-assistance payments to defer income tax on them for one year.    The bill also would remove the limit on the amount of long-term bonds the Treasury can issue.    Several amendments approved yesterday, along with revised estimates by Senate tax writers, increased the package's revenue to nearly $3 billion from the earlier estimate of $2.7 billion.    As part of the package, the Senate unanimously approved an amendment that would impose two tiers of economic sanctions to punish Iraq for allegedly using poison gas against Kurdish rebels. The measure initially would ban sales of weapons and items that could have a military use, and instructs U.S. officials to vote against loans to Iraq in international financial institutions.    The bill also would require the president to choose, by Dec. 31, another penalty from a range of sanctions unless he can certify that he has assurances from Baghdad that it has ceased using chemical weapons and won't use them in the future. The possible measures include a restriction on Iraqi imports, including petroleum, additional restrictions on exports, denial of access to Export-Import Bank loans and a downgrading of diplomatic relations.    Another amendment adopted by the Senate would allow a medical-expense deduction for the costs of testing radon-gas levels. The Senate also agreed to an amendment to save developers of residential lots from having to pay both interest on deferred taxes from income received in installment sales and minimum tax on the same income, which they would have begun doing in 1989.    The Senate rejected amendments by Sen. Bradley that would have dropped revenue-losing provisions that largely benefit corporations. The recaptured revenue would have been used to pay for an expansion of the earned-income credit, which helps low-income working families with children, and for the anti-drug bill now moving through Congress.    The Senate dropped a provision that would have boosted taxes on individuals who use their homes as their offices. A provision in the bill would have prohibited any deduction of the base cost of a telephone that is also used for personal purposes, but yesterday's action means taxpayers can continue deducting this cost. </TEXT></DOC>
