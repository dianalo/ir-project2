In connection withthe exercise of this authority, the Commission is required by the NationalEnvironmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), to give appropriate considerationto the environmental impacts of its actions. The scope of such considerationand the procedure to be followed by the Commission in fulfilling its NEPAresponsibilities are addressed by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982,as amended (NWPA). This statute directs the Commission to adopt the environmentalimpact statement (EIS) prepared by the Department of Energy (the applicantfor the NRC license with respect to the repository) ``to the extent practicable,''with the further proviso that adoption of DOE's EIS shall be deemed tosatisfy the Commission's NEPA responsibilities ``and no further considerationshall be required.'' The Commission has been engaged in rulemaking to implementthis statutory framework. The Commission accordingly undertook a careful review of the text and statutoryhistory of the pertinent provisions of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. Theresults of this review were presented in the notice of proposed rulemakingpublished in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on May 5, 1988, 53 FR 16131. As summarized therein:(1) The Commission will conduct a thorough review of DOE's draft EIS andwill provide comments to DOE regarding the adequacy of the statement. (2) If requested by Congress pursuant to the NWPA, the Commission willprovide comments on DOE's EIS to the Congress with respect to a State orTribal notice of disapproval of a designated site.(3) The NRC will find it practicable to adopt DOE's EIS (or any DOE supplementalEIS) unless:(a) The action proposed to be taken by the NRC differs in an environmentallysignificant way from the action described in DOE's license application,or(b) Significant and substantial new information or new considerations renderthe DOE EIS inadequate.(4) The DOE EIS will accompany the application through the Commission'sreview process, but will be subject to litigation in NRC's licensing proceedingonly where factors 3(a) or 3(b) are present.In accordance with NWPA, the primary responsibility for evaluating environmentalimpacts lies with DOE, and DOE would therefore be required to supplementthe EIS, whenever necessary, to consider changes in its proposed activitiesor any significant new information.The Commission received nine letters of comment in response to its noticeof proposed rulemaking. The commenters were the State of Nevada (NuclearWaste Project Office), the U.S. Department of Energy, the Council on EnvironmentalQuality, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and several privateorganizations (the Nevada Nuclear Waste Task Force, the Environmental DefenseFund, the Southwest Research and Information Center, the Sierra Club, andthe Edison Electric Institute).After reviewing and giving careful consideration to all the comments received,the Commission now adopts, in substantial part, the position set forthin its earlier notice. In particular, the Commission continues to emphasizeits view that its role under NWPA is oriented toward health and safetyissues and that, in general, nonradiological environmental issues are intendedto be resolved in advance of NRC licensing decisions through the actionsof the Department of Energy, subject to Congressional and judicial reviewin accordance with NWPA and other applicable law. The Commission anticipatesthat many environmental questions would have been, or at least could havebeen, adjudicated in connection with an environmental impact statementprepared by DOE, and such questions should not be reopened in proceedingsbefore NRC.<ITAG tagnum="84">State of Nevada Comments </ITAG>We begin with the comments presented by the State of Nevada not only becauseof its important sovereign interests, but because of the fundamental natureof the issues that are raised. In Nevada's view, NRC ``poses, analyzesand answers the wrong question.'' According to Nevada, the question ishow NRC should perform its own, independent, NEPA responsibilities andnot how NRC should review and approve the adequacy of DOE's EIS. Having posed the question in terms of responsibilities under NEPA, Nevadareviews the many cases that hold that where a major federal action involvestwo or more federal agencies, each agency must evaluate the environmentalconsequences of the entire project and determine independently whetherthe statutory requirements have been satisfied. NRC is not relieved fromthe responsibility of making such an independent determination, accordingto the State, because it would still be able to carry out its licensingresponsibilities in a manner consistent with law. NRC, which is directedby NWPA to adopt the DOE environmental impact statement ``to the extentpracticable,'' need only do so to the extent that it is otherwise withinthe customary practice of the agency.The views of the State bring the question into sharp focus. If the issuewere properly to be posed as Nevada urges_i.e., with an assumption thatthe Commission's NEPA responsibilities are not modified by NWPA_then theregulatory language suggested in its comment letter would have merit. Butthe Commission firmly believes that the law was intended to have all mattersassociated with the environmental impacts of repository development consideredand decided, to the fullest extent practicable, apart from NRC licensingproceedings. As explained when the proposed rule was published, this interpretationis supported both by the specific legislative and judicial review proceduresbuilt into the statutory structure and by the accompanying legislativehistory. The Commission believes that the result is sensible. Concernsarising under NEPA_if not resolved through the negotiation procedures establishedby NWPA_would be adjudicated early, with finality, and with every reasonableargument being capable of being advanced to the oversight of Congress andthe courts. From that point on, in the absence of substantial new informationor other new considerations, it would be proper to inquire only whetherthe specific detailed proposal of the Department of Energy could be implementedin a manner consistent with the health and safety of the public. The resolutionof issues in this manner for purposes of NEPA would in no event affectthe framing or decision of health and safety issues, under the Atomic EnergyAct, in NRC licensing proceedings.\1\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The State took exception to the standard for completenessof information in a license application_viz. the ``reasonably available''standard of 10 CFR 60.24. Although the matter is not strictly at issuein this rulemaking, the Commission regards the State's concern in thisregard to be overdrawn. While information may be sufficient to meet therequirements of andSection; 60.24, this in no way implies that such informationwill prove to be sufficient to meet the applicant's burden of persuasionunder andSection; 60.31. Although quite different statutory schemes are involved, we perceive aparallel with issues raised in <T3>Quivira Mining Company</T3> v. <T3>NRC, </T3>866 F.2d 1246 (10th Cir. 1989). That case concerned regulationsadopted by NRC pursuant to the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation ControlAct of 1978. It considered, among other things, the extent to which NRC,in giving the ``due consideration to economic costs'' required by the statute,could rely upon a cost-benefit study previously carried out by the EnvironmentalProtection Agency to support EPA's rulemaking responsibilities. The Commissionconcluded that since the agencies' actions coincided in material respects,all statutory language would retain significant force and effect, and thetime period allowed for the issuance of its regulations was inadequatefor an independent study, Congress did not wish to require the NRC to performa second cost-benefit analysis. The Court found the legislative history,as well as the statutory language, to be ambiguous on the question; assuch, it upheld the NRC construction. Here, given the identity of the actionsbeing considered by the two agencies (DOE and NRC), we believe it to bea fair reading of Congressional intent that NRC can adequately exerciseits NEPA decisionmaking responsibility with respect to a repository byrelying upon DOE's environmental impact statement. As in <T3>Quivira Mining, </T3>the timing requirement_under NWPA, a three-yearlicensing process for a unique facility, involving standards of exceptionalcomplexity, requiring disputatious predictions of future human activityand natural processes for thousands of years_supplies practical supportfor our interpretation. Congress did not speak to the precise questionof the standard to be used in deciding whether adoption of DOE's environmentalimpact statement is practicable; and if our construction is not the onlyone that might be proposed, it seems to us to be, at a minimum, ``permissible.''Once DOE's EIS has been adopted, the statute expressly relieves the Commissionfrom further consideration of the environmental concerns addressed in thestatement. Congressional review of a State's resolution of disapproval_shouldsuch a resolution be passed_would permit (and, most likely, virtually ensure)that issues other than those to be adjudicated under the Atomic EnergyAct would have been considered and weighed. Under these circumstances,it would do no violence to national environmental policy to proscribe furtherexamination in administrative proceedings. <ITAG tagnum="84">Council on Environmental Quality Comments</ITAG>The Commission invited the Council on Environmental Quality to commenton the proposed rule. The conclusion of CEQ was similar to that of theState of Nevada. In particular, CEQ read the phrase ``to the extent practicable''to mean that NRC should make an independent evaluation of the DOE environmentalimpact statement, adopting some or all of it as appropriate so as to avoidunnecessary duplication. From the Commission's perspective, though, theposition does not fully take into account the detailed scheme for environmentalreview established by NWPA. Neither the related provisions of the statute(including, for example, those dealing with legislative and judicial reviewand establishing time frames for Commission decisionmaking) are analyzed,nor is there any examination of the legislative history which, as describedin the preamble to the proposed rule, supports our point of view. We continueto believe that it is clear_at least in the debates of the House of Representativeswith respect to the bill which, with amendments, was enacted into law_thatthe Commission role was intentionally to be directed to health and safetyissues to the exclusion, absent new information or new considerations,of issues arising under NEPA. It is worth noting, though, that CEQ recognizes that the Commission might``defer'' to a court finding that the DOE environmental impact statementis adequate. This is certainly close, if not identical to, the Commission'sposition that a judicial finding of adequacy would preclude further litigationof the matter in NRC licensing proceedings. <ITAG tagnum="84">Comments of Environmental Organizations</ITAG>The environmental organizations' comments included a number of argumentssimilar to those of the State of Nevada with respect to the Commission'scustomary NEPA responsibilities. As already indicated, it is our view thatCongress intended, under NWPA, for NRC to accept the DOE EIS in the absenceof substantial new considerations or new information. We reject the suggestionmade by the Sierra Club that the approach we have outlined amounts to anabdication of any Commission responsibility. In addition, however, a number of comments of somewhat narrower scope weresubmitted by environmental organizations (as well as by the State of Nevada)and are addressed here. One matter that particularly concerned the private Nevada Nuclear WasteTask Force involved the relationship between the judicial process and theCommission's administrative process. The Task Force cautioned that NRCshould not rely on there having been a court ruling with regard to theadequacy of DOE's environmental impact statement in advance of the Commission'slicensing decision (when a judicial finding of inadequacy, affecting muchor little of the EIS, could be treated as a new consideration). In fact,such reliance is not essential. It is our expectation that, under NWPA,a petition for review of the EIS would need to have been filed roughlycontemporaneously with DOE's submission of a license application to NRC,and that judgment might have been entered within the three years envisagedfor Commission licensing. Whether or not this proves to be the case isnot controlling, for the standard for adoption does not rest upon collateralestoppel principles. Similarly, we find it beside the point to speculateregarding the possibility that a reviewing court might delay its decisionon the adequacy until it sees the NRC conclusions in the licensing proceeding.Such delay would not stand in the way of the Commission's taking finalaction. Although we thus do not rest our position upon the availability of a priorjudgment of a court, we reiterate our view, as described in the preambleto the proposed rule, that such a judgment, if entered, would be controllingon the question of the adequacy of the EIS; and if the EIS were found tobe adequate, it would be practicable for the Commission to adopt it. We were criticized for suggesting that members of the public might be precludedfrom raising issues anew on the grounds that they had been representedby State officials in prior judicial proceedings. This position was claimedto be inconsistent with NRC intervention rules which, it is correctly argued,traditionally consider the interests of the state in which a facility islocated as being distinguishable from the interests of particular membersof the public who may be affected by the issuance of a license. Our firstresponse is that our case law with respect to standing for purposes ofintervention does not necessarily apply in the context of collateral estoppelor issue preclusion, where the policies of repose come into play. But,in addition, we would reach the same result even if informed members ofthe public were not constrained by the putative prior judgment againstthe state; for in that event their failure to pursue their claims withinthe 180 days specified by section 119 of NWPA would operate as a bar. The Commission's position that failure to challenge DOE's environmentalimpact statement promptly in the courts bars subsequent challenge to thatEIS in NRC proceedings was also criticized. Commenters suggested, instead,that affected parties may decide for reasons of litigative strategy orotherwise to contest questions regarding the repository in NRC licensingproceedings rather than by going to court about the DOE environmental impactstatement. But such a unilateral decision on their part cannot operateas a means to circumvent the clear policy of the NWPA requiring promptadjudication of the issues raised by the EIS. When there has been a fulland fair opportunity to raise the challenge, a party's failure to availitself should in our view be regarded as an abandonment of its right todo so many years later. <T3>See Oregon Natural Resources Council</T3> v.<T3> U.S. Forest Service, </T3>834 F.2d 842, 847 (9th Cir. 1987). There is force to a commenter's suggestion that our proposed rules failedto take account of an EIS having been prepared in connection with a Negotiator-selectedsite, in which case the Commission review would be governed by section407 of NWPA, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 10247, instead of section 114, 42 U.S.C.10134. One difference, as pointed out by the comment, is that for a Negotiator-selectedsite DOE makes no formal recommendation to the President and the Presidentmakes no decision with respect to approval of the site. This differencealone would not affect the approach we take to discharging our NEPA responsibilities,in part because we would expect early judicial review to be available evenin the absence of a Presidential decision. In this regard, NWPA authorizesa civil action to review any EIS prepared with respect to ``any action''under the applicable subpart and, given our perspective on the intendedallocation of functions between DOE and NRC, ``any action'' could includethe Secretary of Energy's submission of an application to the Commission.We think the intent of Congress, as evidenced by the considerable parallelismof the language employed, was generally to establish the same sort of rolefor the Commission with respect to any site_whether at Yucca Mountain orat a Negotiator-selected location. We recognize that it is our obligation``to consider the Yucca Mountain site as an alternate to (the Negotiator-selectedsite) in the preparation of'' an EIS. This obligation will be discharged,though, to the extent of our adoption of the DOE environmental impact statement,provided that the alternative sites were addressed therein. One aspect of the Negotiator-selected site provisions does have to be takeninto account, however. For a Negotiator-selected site, a Commission decisionto adopt the environmental impact statement must be made ``in accordancewith andSection; 1506.3 of Title 40, Code of Federal Regulations,''_a limitationthat we found not to apply to the EIS submitted under section 114 of NWPA.Under the cited section of the CEQ regulations, the Commission may onlyadopt the DOE statement if it is ``adequate.'' While a judicial decisionon the point would be controlling, we would otherwise need to make an independentjudgment in accordance with established practice. The final regulationsreflect this possibility. In passing, though, we observe that we find nothinganomalous in having this responsibility in the case of a Negotiator-selectedsite but not in the case of the Congressionally-designated site at YuccaMountain, for in the latter case there are opportunities for State disapprovaland Congressional consideration that serve to provide a forum outside theDepartment for the evaluation of environmental concerns. We are not persuaded by the comment that took exception to our requirementthat needed supplements to the EIS would, as a general rule, have to beprepared by DOE_and that DOE's failure to comply with this requirementmight be grounds for denial of a construction authorization. It seems tous that such supplementation by DOE would ordinarily be appropriate whenever,in the light of new information or new considerations, its proposed actionmay give rise to significant environmental impacts that were not addressedin its original EIS. We were urged to reconsider our position with respect to the impositionof license conditions directed at mitigation of adverse environmental impacts.We had suggested that DOE could itself be held accountable for compliancewith the mitigation measures described in its EIS, so that there was noneed for them to be subject to litigation in NRC proceedings. The basisfor our position is that the departure from planned mitigation measuresmay well be a major Federal action having significant environmental impacts,which would necessitate the preparation of an environmental impact statementfor a project that was otherwise determined to be without significant impact.But, in any event, we see no basis for employing our regulatory authorityin this instance to police DOE's compliance with its mitigation plans;it will be subject to no more and no less oversight from interested personsthan would be the case for many other developmental projects carried out,after preparation of appropriate environmental documentation, by Federaldepartments and agencies. To permit the mitigation measures to be litigatedin NRC administrative proceedings_legitimate as this may be in other contexts_wouldrun counter to the direction of the NWPA. It would bring in through theback door at least some of the contentions which, in our view, were tobe settled in other forums. An argument was made that amended section 114(f)(6)_which provides that``the Commission'' need not consider enumerated factors in any EIS preparedwith respect to a repository_indicates that Congress intended for NRC toissue its own EIS. The language in question appears to have been designedas an editorial measure, lacking substantive effect. The legislative history,cited with the proposed rule, demonstrates that no important change wasbeing made in NRC's NEPA responsibilities, which under the 1982 statutewere limited in the manner we have described. The statutory language isnot surplusage, for NRC may have an obligation to prepare a supplementalEIS where there are new considerations or new information. <ITAG tagnum="84">Department of Energy Comments</ITAG>The Department of Energy, which is the prospective applicant affected bythe proposed rules, agreed that NWPA counsels against wide-ranging independentexamination by NRC of environmental concerns during the course of the licensingproceedings. DOE also concurred with NRC's view that a judicial determinationof adequacy of an EIS precludes further litigation of that issue and thatfailure to raise an issue within the time set out in NWPA bars later challenge.The other DOE comments call for some clarification of the Commission'sintentions, but do not prompt any fundamental change of the position thathad previously been outlined. For example, we can put to rest DOE's concern that NRC might defer itsacceptance review of the license application until the entire judicialreview process on the EIS had run its course. Under the amendments, bothas proposed and as adopted, the acceptance review applies only to the completenessof ``the application,'' not ``the application or environmental report''as under existing 10 CFR 2.101(f)(2). We believe we can also satisfy DOE's concern with respect to our mention,at 53 FR 16132, that there may be a need for ``multiple EIS's.'' The pointbeing made was not that NRC might need to prepare its own EIS when DOEhad already done so, but that the licensing process may involve more thanone major federal action (for example, the construction of the repositoryon the one hand and the emplacement of waste on the other) that could necessitatethe preparation of a supplemental EIS if not an entirely new one, if theimpacts of such actions are not evaluated or properly encompassed in theinitial EIS. The responsibility for supplementation was another point of contention.DOE_along with some of the other commenters_argued that it would be inappropriatefor it to be obliged to supplement its completed EIS in order to satisfyany independent NEPA responsibilities of the Commission. We agree withthis statement. But, as DOE itself acknowledges, it might need to supplementthe EIS if it were to make a substantial change in the proposed actionor if significant new circumstances or information were to become available.That is all that is required by the regulatory language (10 CFR 60.24(c)).However, in support of its position, DOE suggested that NRC adoption underthe NWPA provisions was related specifically to the EIS ``submitted aspart of the Department's recommendation to the President.'' But the languageof Section 114(f) quite clearly applies to ``any environmental impact statementprepared in connection with a repository proposed to be constructed'' byDOE under NWPA. DOE is correct in pointing out that a supplemental EIS would not necessarilybe required in the event of a substantial change in the proposed action,where the change and the impacts thereof had previously been consideredin the original statement.The principal remaining issue raised by DOE's comments concerns the appropriaterole of NRC in DOE's NEPA activities. DOE suggests that NRC should be a``cooperating agency,'' a role that the Council on Environmental Qualityhas recognized as being appropriate in the licensor-licensee context. Weare not persuaded. The present situation is unique because_unlike the customarylicensor-licensee situation_the particular statute guiding our approach(i.e., NWPA) removes the balancing of environmental considerations fromour independent judgment. Under these circumstances, it strikes us as particularlyout of place for NRC to undertake the kind of critical evaluation thata ``cooperating agency'' should perform in the preparation of an EIS. TheCommission, nevertheless, has jurisdiction and expertise that it can, andwill, bring to DOE's attention as a commenting agency through the entireDOE NEPA process. We shall not hesitate, in particular, to raise concernsthat might subsequently also require adjudication, under the standardsof the Atomic Energy Act, in our licensing proceedings. Other issues, ofcourse, can be identified in our comments as well. In other words, NRCas a commenting agency can and will play an important constructive roleall the while from the scoping stage through preparation of the environmentalimpact statement; but as the sole responsibility for weighing the environmentalimpacts in support of a recommendation to the President is vested in DOE,DOE properly should be the agency with formal sponsorship of the EIS aswell. We respond, finally, to DOE's claim that the requirement for DOE to informthe Commission of the status of legal action on the repository is unnecessary,since this information is a matter of public record. As a general rule,the applicant has the burden of placing on the record those factual mattersupon which NRC decisions may be predicated. Although we have not placedsole reliance upon principles of issue preclusion (collateral estoppel),it remains our position that a final judgment of a reviewing court withrespect to the adequacy of the DOE final environmental impact statementwould be controlling and would support our adoption of such FEIS. Accordingly,it is appropriate for DOE to report on the status thereof. <ITAG tagnum="84">Industry Comments</ITAG>Comments received from Edison Electric Institute generally supported theCommission's view that its essential responsibility under NWPA is to addressradiological safety issues under the Atomic Energy Act, and that the requirementsof NEPA were substantively modified as they apply to the high-level nuclearwaste program. We decline to follow EEI's suggestion that issues related to adoption ofDOE's environmental impact statement be made prior to the hearing processand outside the adjudicatory arena. As we have noted before, the impactstatement does not simply ``accompany'' an agency recommendation for actionin the sense of having some independent significance in isolation fromthe deliberative process. Rather the impact statement is an integral partof the Commission's decision. It forms as much a vital part of the NRC'sdecisional record as anything else. <T3>Public Service Company of Oklahoma </T3>(Black Fox Station, Units 1and 2), CLI-80-31, 12 NRC 264, 275 (1980). Even though the range of issuesto be considered in the hearing may be limited, the formal function ofthe environmental impact statement as an element of the licensing decisionremains. However, we find merit in EEI's proposal to fix an early schedule for theNRC staff to present its position on the practicability of adoption andfor other parties to file contentions with respect to the practicabilityof adoption. Accordingly, the final rule requires the NRC staff to presentits position on adoption at the time that the notice of hearing is publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. Any contentions filed by any other party tothe proceeding must be filed within thirty days after the notice of hearingis published. In the event that ``substantial new considerations or newinformation'' subsequently arises, contentions concerning the practicabilityof adopting DOE's EIS that are filed after the 30-day deadline establishedin the rule must be accompanied by a demonstration of compliance with thelate filing criteria in 10 CFR 2.1014. <ITAG tagnum="84">Changes from the Proposed Rule</ITAG>Section 51.67 Environmental Information Concerning Geologic RepositoriesThis section is revised to provide for the submission of environmentalimpact statements, pursuant to Title IV of NWPA, as amended, with respectto a Negotiator-selected site. A further change reflects DOE's commentthat supplement would not be required where a modification to its planshad been previously addressed by its EIS.Section 51.109 Public Hearings in Proceedings for Issuance of MaterialsLicense with Respect to a Geologic RepositoryIn the final rule, paragraph (a) incorporates a schedule for the staffto present its position on the practicability of adoption of the DOE environmentalimpact statement, and for the filing of contentions with respect thereto.Consistent with the recently-completed LSS (Licensing Support System) rulemaking,a period of thirty days after notice of hearing is provided for the submissionof contentions. Paragraph (c) is revised so that the special criterion for adoption, asdiscussed herein, will apply only with respect to the geologic repositoryat the Yucca Mountain site. Any EIS for a Negotiator-selected site wouldbe excluded from the application of this paragraph. A conforming changeappears in paragraph (d). Paragraph (e) is modified to emphasize that the Commission's customarypolicies will be observed except for adoption of an EIS prepared underSection 114. This is achieved by the insertion of the cross-reference (``inaccordance with paragraph (c)'') in the introductory clause. As the languagehas been modified, it permits the adoption of other DOE environmental impactstatements with respect to a Negotiator-selected site in accordance withgenerally applicable law. This includes observance of the procedures outlinedin 40 CFR 1506.3. This is addressed adequately in Appendix A to 10 CFRPart 51, Subpart A, and requires no further elaboration in the text ofthe rule. <ITAG tagnum="84">Petition for Rulemaking</ITAG>The Commission's earlier notice invited comments upon the related portionsof a petition for rulemaking submitted by the States of Nevada and Minnesota,PRM-60-2A, 50 FR 51701, December 19, 1985. With the exception of the Stateof Nevada, none of the comments received by the Commission in responseto the notice addressed the petition as such. The State of Nevada referredto the petition, recognized that some of the considerations therein havebeen mooted, and urged that alternative language be considered in the proposedrule, in place of that which they had recommended in the petition. The section of the petition which provides language pertaining to the adoptionof DOE's EIS (i.e., Section IV.3) is denied. However, the issues identifiedby the petition regarding the criteria and procedures for adoption of DOE'sEIS have been considered in this proceeding. Although the language beingpromulgated differs from that proposed by the petitioners, the Commissionis in full agreement with the petitioners' argument that adoption of DOE'sEIS must not compromise the independent responsibilities of NRC to protectthe public health and safety under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. Our rulemakingapproach is in fact designed to enhance our ability to address these healthand safety issues as effectively and objectively as possible. <ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Impact: Categorical Exclusion</ITAG>The NRC has determined that this regulation is the type of action describedin categorical exclusions 10 CFR 51.22(c)(1) and (3).
