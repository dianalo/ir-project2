In particular, evidence of the importance of morphologicaland sedimentological measurement is provided. Using continuous nuclearmeasurement of sediment concentration and of other river parameters,the dimension and the velocity of river evolution can be measured, givinga quantitative evaluation of the contribution of sediment transport tomodifying the river bed. The implementation of bed load sampling allowsdetermination of the importance of large size grain movement and itsrelative frequency in the total load. The method permits determinationof the total amount of sediment carried to the sea, giving an importantincrease of knowledge on the evolution of the coastline. (author). 10refs, 10 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
