Hawkins-RobertT. Stafford Elementary and Secondary School Improvement Amendments of 1988,Pub. L. 100-297. Principal themes of this new legislation are to promoteaccess to quality education for educationally deprived students and excellencein education for the Nation as a whole. In framing the legislation, Congressnoted that Americans are becoming increasingly aware that enhancing educationalopportunities is an investment in the future of the Nation. A less thanquality education for elementary and secondary students would have severeand far-reaching economic consequences, such as much expensive programsfor remediating older students' deficiencies, retraining unskilled workers,foregone tax revenues, and lost productivity. In keeping with these themes, Title I of the Hawkins-Stafford Act amendsthe Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) (the Act) toinclude a number of new and reauthorized Federal education programs. Oneof these programs is Chapter 1 of Title I of the ESEA, which reauthorizesprograms previously contained in Chapter 1 of the Education Consolidationand Improvement Act of 1981 (ECIA). Part A of Chapter 1, which would beimplemented by these proposed regulations, provides financial assistancethrough SEAs to LEAs to meet the special educational needs of educationallydeprived children in school attendance areas with high concentrations ofchildren from low-income families and of children in local institutionsfor neglected or delinquent children. This assistance is to improve theeducational opportunities of educationally deprived children by helpingthese children succeed in the regular program, attain grade-level proficiency,and improve achievement in basic and more advanced skills. Part A of Chapter1 also provides financial assistance to the U.S. Secretary of the Interiorfor Indian children. In reauthorizing the Chapter 1 LEA Program, Congress retained the basicgoals and structure of the program. Within the basic framework, however,Congress sought to strengthen and improve the program in a number of importantrespects. First, the reauthorization attempts to ensure that funds underthe Chapter 1 LEA Program are targeted in areas and on children whose needsare the greatest. For example, section 1006 of the Act authorizes concentrationgrants for areas with particularly high concentrations of children fromlow-income families. Likewise, section 1013 refines the selection of eligibleareas and schools by, for example, explicitly requiring ranking in orderof poverty and restricting the ``grandfathering'' of ineligible areas toone year. Section 1014 also improves targeting by directing funds to thosechildren determined, through an annual assessment of need, to be in greatestneed of special assistance. Second, the reauthorization emphasizes accountability and program effectiveness.Sections 1020 and 1021 are the centerpiece of efforts to improve the qualityof Chapter 1 LEA projects. These sections require an LEA to identify unsuccessfulprojects and modify those projects, with the assistance of the SEA if necessary,to effect needed improvements. Section 1021(f) requires a similar identificationand assessment of the program for participating children whose academicperformance is not improving as it should. In addition, section 1435 requiresthe Secretary, in consultation with State and local agencies, to developnational standards for local evaluation of programs. Third, the reauthorization encourages program improvement in other ways.For example, section 1011(b) authorizes an LEA to reserve up to and includingfive percent of its allocation under Part A of Chapter 1 for innovationprojects. The Act also emphasizes in several places the requirement foran LEA to consider achievement not only in basic skills but also in moreadvanced skills to create an expectation that all students can master thosenecessary skills. In addition, an LEA must assure in its application thatit will allocate time and resources for frequent and regular coordinationof the curriculum of projects under Part A of Chapter 1 with the LEA'sregular instructional program. Fourth, the reauthorization contains a number of provisions to providegreater flexibility in the use of funds received under Part A of Chapter1. The primary new provision that affords greater flexibility is section1015 concerning schoolwide projects, which permits an LEA to use thosefunds in schools with high concentrations of children from low-income familiesto upgrade the entire educational program in the school. Section 1015 elminatesthe provision requiring a matching contribution of State and local fundsfor every child in the schoolwide project who is not eligible for Chapter1. Fifth, the reauthorization includes strong new parental involvement requirementsin section 1016. Like the Department's existing regulations on parentalinvolvement under Chapter 1 of the ECIA, section 1016 does not mandatethe particular forms that parental involvement should take. However, itincorporates a number of specific requirements that an LEA must implementto ensure significant parent involvement. Significantly, section 1016 adoptsmany of the parent involvement provisions set forth in the existing Chapter1 LEA regulations, including strong emphasis on training parents to workwith their children at home. Finally, the reauthorization contains several new provisions concerningservices for private school children under Part A of Chapter 1. For example,section 1017(d) authorizes payments to cover capital expenses incurredby an LEA in providing equitable services to private school children sincethe Supreme Court's decision in <T3>Aguilar </T3><T3>v. </T3><T3>Felton.</T3> Section 1017(b)(3)(A) also requires the Secretary to investigateand resolve a complaint that equitable services are not being providedto eligible private school children within 120 days after receiving thecomplaint. <ITAG tagnum="84">Negotiated Rulemaking Demonstration </ITAG>Section 1431(b) of the Act contains procedural requirements that the Departmentis to follow in developing and issuing regulations to govern the Chapter1 LEA Program. Section 1431(b)(1) requires the Secretary to convene regionalmeetings to gain input on the content of proposed regulations. Participantsat these meetings are to include representatives of Federal, State, andlocal administrators, parents, teachers, and local school board members.Subsequent to these meetings, section 1431(b)(2) requires the Secretaryto draft and submit regulations on a minimum of four key issues to a modifiednegotiated rulemaking process as a demonstration of the process. Participantsin the demonstration are to be selected from among those attending theregional meetings. In accordance with these requirements, the Department convened five regionalmeetings to discuss primarily six issues: Targeting of school attendanceareas and students, schoolwide projects, parental involvement, programimprovement, State administration, and national evaluation standards. Meetingswere held in Atlanta, Georgia, May 23-24; Philadelphia (Langhorne), Pennsylvania,May 26-27; Indianapolis, Indiana, June 1-2; Denver, Colorado, June 6-7;and San Francisco, California, June 9-10. Organizations representing theinterest groups named in the Act were invited to nominate persons to beinvited to the meetings. The Department announced these meetings in the<T4>Federal Register</T4> (53 FR 16292-93, May 6, 1988). Upon conclusionof the meetings the Department invited eighteen representatives to participatein a modified negotiation rulemaking process on July 19-20, 1988. The Departmentannounced this meeting in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (53 FR 26214-15, July 11, 1988). Taking intoaccount views expressed at the regional meetings, the Department prepareddraft regulations on the six main issues discussed, which served as thebasis for the negotiated rulemaking process.  Following is a brief synopsis by topic area for the major issues and outcomesof the two-day negotiations. For each topic, the Department's draft proposedregulation is described, followed by the result of the negotiated rulemaking. <ITAG tagnum="84">Targeting  </ITAG>The draft proposed regulations included four provisions not contained inthe Act and therefore strictly regulatory:  1. Section 200.6(c) defined ``educationally deprived child'' as a childwhose educational attainment is below what is expected for the child'sage.  While the group supported retention of the defintion of ``educationallydeprived child,'' consensus on the language was not obtained. The definitionin the proposed regulations contains the Department's proposed language,which is the same as that contained in the regulations for Chapter 1 ofthe ECIA and prior regulations under Title I of the ESEA.  2. Section 200.30(a)(1)(ii) set rules for determining attendance areashaving high concentrations of low-income children, which the Departmentproposed to be areas in which the precentage or number of low-income childrenwas at least as high as the percentage or average number per school oflow-income children in the district as a whole.   The Department's proposal concerning attendance areas with high concentrationsof low-income children has been modified to clarify that the identificationmay be made on a districtwide or grade span basis. While no specific languagewas proposed to the negotiation group, the group agreed that the changeshould be made.  3. Section 200.30(b)(3)(ii) made applicable other attendance area provisionsto schools selected to participate in the Chapter 1 LEA Program. The groupagreed to the Department's language.  4. Section 200.31(c)(5)(ii) clarified the selection of limited Englishproficient children to particiate in the Chapter 1 LEA Program. The groupagreed to the Department's proposal.  The group also requested that the Department provide guidance on severalitems in the Policy Manual required by section 1436 of the Act. The itemsinclude the following:  1. Section 1013(b)(1) of the Act, allowing LEAs to serve all attendanceareas when the percentage of low-income children in each attendance areais within five percentage points of the districtwide average of low-incomechildren. The Department interprets this provision to mean five percentagepoints above the five percentage points below the average.  2. The effect on the selection of private school children if, in accordancewith section 1013(b)(4) of the Act, an LEA selects a school rather thanan attendance area to participate in the program. 3. Provisions in sections 1013(b)(5) and 1014(c)(3) related to continuationof services to schools and children no longer eligible to receive servicesunder standard selection procedures.   4. Section 1013(b)(6) related to skipping schools that are receiving comparableservices supported with non-Federal funds.5. Under section 1014(d)(1), what constitutes valid assessment of limitedEnglish proficient children for selection to participate in the Chapter1 LEA Program.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Parental Involvement  </ITAG>The draft proposed regulations contained three provisions not in the Actand therefore strictly regulatory:   1. Section 200.6(c) defined ``in loco parentis'' as a person with whoma child lives who acts in place of a parent, such as a grandparent, stepparent,aunt, uncle, or older sibling.While the group agrees that the terms ``in loco parentis'' should be defined,it did not reach consensus on specific language. The proposed regulationsmodify the Department's original proposal to make clear that persons otherthan relatives may also act in place of a parent. In addition, the proposedregulations permit a parent or legal guardian to designate a person withwhom a child does not live to act in place of the parent or guardian. 2. Section 200.34(a)(2)(ii) specified that consultation with parents beorganized, systematic, ongoing, informed, and timely.  The group agreed to the Department's proposal, with a modification to makethe provision apply to all consultation, not just the consultation requiredunder andSection;200.34. The proposed regulations reflect this modification. 3. Section 200.34(e) clarified that allowable parental involvement activitiesmay be paid for with funds received under this part.  The group agreed to the provisions in andSection;200.34(e), adding languageto make clear that only Chapter 1 parental activities may be supportedwith funds under this part.  Several additional items were raised by group members. Consensus was reachedto include language in andSection;200.34(c)(1)(i) that written policies mustprovide for timely responses to recommendations by parents. The group alsoagreed to clarify in andSection;200.34(a) that parental involvement mustoccur in the planning, design, and implementation of Chapter 1 LEA programs.No agreement was reached on a proposal that the regulations specify thatconsultation take place on both a districtwide and on a school-by-schoolbasis, and the proposed regulations do not contain that provision. TheDepartment thinks that this decision is best made at State or local levels. <ITAG tagnum="84">Schoolwide Projects  </ITAG>Draft regulations proposed by the Department included four regulatory provisionsfor schoolwide projects not specified in section 1015 of the Act:    1. Section 200.36(c)(1) described how an LEA shall determine the numberof educationally deprived children in a schoolwide project and clarifiedan LEA's responsibility to provide additional funds if the amount allocatedto a project is not sufficient to meet the size, scope, and quality requirement. The negotiated rulemaking group agreed with the two methods outlined inthe draft proposed regulations for determining the number of educationallydeprived children in a schoolwide project. This provision is containedin andSection;200.36(c)(1)(i) of the proposed regulations. The group alsoagreed to retain the regulatory requirement that LEA's provide sufficientfunds for a schoolwide project to ensure that the project is of sufficientsize, scope, and quality to give reasonable promise of success. This isincluded in andSection;200.36(c)(1)(ii) of the proposed regulations. However,as agreed by the group, the language was modified to shorten the provisionand make clear the LEA's responsibility to ensure that sufficient fundsare allocated for a schoolwide project while removing the specific requirementthat an LEA allocate funds received under this part in excess of the perpupil average in other Chapter 1 schools.  2. Section 200.36(d)(2)(iii) clarified that an LEA is not required to demonstratethat particular services paid for with funds under this part supplementthe services regularly provided in a school operating a schoolwide project.Group members accepted this regulatory provision without discussion.  3. Section 200.36(f)(1) clarified that, in meeting accountability requirements,comparisons of achievement levels must be made between children of comparablestanding.  Group members agreed to this clarification as contained in andSection;200.36(f)(1)of the proposed regulations. Furthermore, the group requested the Departmentto add language clarifying that the accountability requirements pertainspecifically to the continuation of a schoolwide project and would notresult in an audit exception for past use of funds. This change also isreflected in andSection;200.36(f)(1) of the proposed regulations.4. Section 200.36(g) clarified that eligible private school children residingin a schoolwide project attendance area must be determined on the samebasis as the number of educationally deprived children in a schoolwideproject is determined under andSection;200.36(c)(1)(i).    The group accepted this provision as drafted, and the proposed regulationsreflect this consensus.    In addition to areas the Department proposed to regulate, participantsraised a concern about the absence of a transition provisions in the three-yeartimeframe established for a schoolwide project during which an informeddecision could be made whether to extend the project for an additionalthree years. Because the statute does not provide for a transition period,the group decided that this issue could not be addressed appropriatelythrough regulations. In addition, group members questioned whether theprogram improvement provisions in sections 1020 and 1021 of the Act shouldapply, given the specific accountability requirements for schoolwide projects.The proposed regulations address this issue in andSection;200.36(f)(5), makingclear that program improvement requirements apply to schoolwide projects.A final issue involved representation and participation of private schoolchildren. A proposal to include private school officials in the list ofindividuals to be involved in planning a schoolwide project under andSection;200.36(b)(6)did not receive consensus and is not included in the proposed regulations.Because it would be incompatible with attending a private school for privateschool children to participate fully in a public schoolwide project, theDepartment believes that inclusion of private school officials in planninga schoolwide project would be inappropriate. The group agreed that schoolwideprojects cannot be conducted in private schools.       <ITAG tagnum="84">Program Improvement    </ITAG>The Department's draft proposed regulations included ten items not specifiedin the Act and therefore strictly regulatory:    1. Section 200.37(a)(2)(i) made clear that program improvement plans forSEAs must include standards for both aggregate performance and substantialprogress toward meeting desired outcomes. Similar changes were made throughoutandSection;andSection;200.37 and 200.38 to clarify that both methods of determiningthe success of Chapter 1 LEA projects apply.    The group did not reach consensus on the inclusion of both aggregate performanceand desired outcomes throughout andSection;andSection; 200.37 and 200.38. TheDepartment believes, however, that this is the most consistent and meaningfulreading of the Act, and the proposed regulations reflect this interpretation.   2. Section 200.37(a)(2)(i) provided that SEAs may establish minimum standardsfor program improvement.    No consensus was obtained on whether the SEA should be explicitly authorizedto set minimum standards for program improvement. However, the Departmentbelieves this authority is implicit in both section 1020(a)(1) concerningprogram improvement and section 1451 concerning State rulemaking authority.In addition, in response to concerns raised by some group members, theproposed regulations clarify that any minimum standards should addressthe proposes of the Chapter 1 LEA Program stated in section 1001(b) ofthe Act.    3. Section 200.37(b)(1)(ii)(A) required SEAs to follow the progress ofschools under local school improvement plans.    At the request of some group members, the Department's proposal has beenmodified to reflect the concern that the requirement to follow the progressof any school identified under andSection;200.38(b)(1) be done with the leastpossible paperwork and burden. While no consensus was reached on inclusionof this provision, the Department wishes to emphasize that the provisionis not meant to require excessive reporting by LEAs.    4, 5, and 6. Section 200.38(b)(5)(i) required LEAs to develop a timelinefor school improvement. Section 200.38(b)(5)(ii) set an outside time limitfor implementation of local school improvement plans. Section 200.38(b)(6)(i)set the time for implementation of joint LEA and SEA plans. Consensus wasreached on the draft timelines.    7. Section 200.38(c)(2) clarified that local conditions may be consideredduring all program improvement activities. Some group members expressedconcern that the provision, as drafted, could lead to setting low expectedoutcomes for certain students or be used to justify poor school or studentperformance. The proposed regulations clarify when LEAs may consider localconditions.    8. Section 200.38(d)(4) stated that student needs assessment data shouldbe used to modify the program. Consensus was reached to add ``if appropriate''to this provision.    9. Section 200.38(e) made clear that private school children are includedin program improvement. The group agreed to this provision.    10. Section 200.38(f) set the effective date for initial data gatheringas the 1988-89 school year. The group agreed to this provision.    In addition to these departmental proposals, the group agreed that a schoolthat shows improvement in aggregate performance and substantial progresstoward meeting desired outcomes during the time it is planning modificationof its program need not implement that modification. This provision isincluded in andSection;200.38(b)(4)(ii).    Some group members suggested inclusion of information contained in theConference Report accompanying the Hawkins-Stafford Act clarifying themeaning of ``improvement.'' Although other members did not agree, the informationhas been included in andSection;200.38(b)(1)(ii). The Department believesthe inclusion of this language clarifies the provision.    Several other issues were raised by group members, most particularly therole of parents and teachers in program improvement. No consensus was reachedon this issue, and the proposed regulations do not address it. The Departmentbelieves that the general parental involvement provisions contained inandSection;200.34 apply to all phases to the Chapter 1 LEA Program, includingprogram improvement, and considers andSection;200.34, together with andSection;200.38(a)(1)(ii),which reiterates a portion of section 1021(a)(1) of the Act, to be sufficient.Further, the Department believes that teacher involvement is implicit inthe requirements to identify schools and students in need of improvement,and in designing plans to bring about the improvement.<ITAG tagnum="84">State Administration    </ITAG>The Department's draft proposed regulations governing State administrationof the Chapter 1 LEA Program contained regulatory provisions not includedin the Act to clarify two aspects of the reauthorization:    1. Regarding the assignment of personnel to supervisory duties under section1453(a) of the Act:    a. Section andSection;200.39(a)(2)(iii) set sixty minutes per day as themaximum time permitted for supervisory duties;    b. Section 200.39(b) allowed the amount of time spent on supervisory dutiesto be calculated on a daily, weekly, monthly, or annual basis; and    c. Section 200.39(c) highlighted allowable supervisory duties to includeactivities such as supervision of halls, playgrounds, lunchrooms, studyhalls, bus loading and unloading, and homerooms; participation as a memberof a school or district curriculum committee; and participation in theselection of regular curriculum materials and supplies.    The negotiation group agreed to these provisions without modification.The proposed regulations reflect this consensus.    2. Regarding State regulations under section 1451 of the Act:    a. Section 200.70(c)(2) clarified an SEA's authority to review and approveLEA applications and to ensure that LEAs use funds received under thispart in accordance with all applicable requirements.    b. Section 200.70(e) made clear that States are to convene a committeeof practitioners before publication of a proposed or final rule or regulation,not just obtain views of each committee member on an individual basis.   Members of the negotiation group accepted the provision under andSection;200.70(c)(2)as proposed, but the group requested changes to andSection;200.70(e). Specifically,praticipants agreed to add representatives of private school children asa category of individuals to be included on the committee as required insection 1451(b) of the Act. The group also agreed to add language fromthe statute providing that a majority of the committee members be LEA representatives.A proposal to include a regulatory requirement that States select membersof the committee of practitioners from nominations submitted by appropriateorganizations and groups was not resolved. Section 200.70(e)(2) of theproposed regulations includes the two changes agreed to by the group andencourages States to seek recommendations from organizations and groups.   Section 200.70(e) of the draft proposed regulations required that the Stateconvene a committee of practitioners before publication of a major proposedor final rule or regulation. Although the statute only appears to requirethat the committee actually convene to review emergency regulations priorto issuance in final form, the Department believed that it would facilitatedevelopment of State rules and regulations if the committee were also convenedbefore publication of <T3>major </T3> rules and regulations. Although the Department only recommendedconvening the committee of practitioners before publishing major rulesor regulations, the negotiation group agreed that the committee shouldbe convened before publication of any proposed or final rule or regulation.Upon further reflection concerning the possible burden on States to convenethe committee for any proposed or final State rules or regulations, theSecretary has decided to return to the statutory language that requiresthat the committee of practitioners convene only to review emergency regulationsprior to issuance in final form. However, as indicated in andSection; 200.70(e)(1)(ii),States are encouraged to convene the committee to review other State rulesand regulations. The Secretary specifically invites comments on the appropriatenessof convening the committee to review only emergency rules or regulations.<ITAG tagnum="84">National Evaluation Standards </ITAG>The draft proposed regulations contained a detailed description of themethods to be used by LEAs and SEAs to provide information to the Departmentin a form that would allow aggregation of the data to national totals.These proposed regulations meet the requirements in section 1435 that theDepartment establish national standards for local evaluations to be usedin this aggregation, and that the Secretary provide SEAs and LEAs withadvance notification of the standards. The draft proposed regulations included some explanations of the technicalstandards that are applicable to LEA and SEA evaluations. During the negotiationgroup's discussion of the length of the evaluation section of the draftproposed regulations, members discussed the need for additional explanatorymaterial and whether the information could be included in the Policy Manualrather than in the regulations. In reponse to concerns with the lengthof the evaluation section, the group agreed to remove all the explanatoryinformation on the technical standards from the regulations and recommendedthat both the removed information as well as additional explanations beincluded in the Policy Manual. While full consensus on the provisions in these sections was not obtained,the majority of the members did agree to the draft proposed regulationswith some revisions. Basically, the proposed regulations would: 1. Require the use of norm-referenced tests to provide aggregate data onthe achievement of children participating in the Chapter 1 LEA Programor, if other tests are used, would require SEAs or LEAs to conduct equatingstudies so that the results of the other tests can be converted to theaggregatable measure. Norm-referenced tests are those for which measuresof attainment have been established through a process that determines thedistribution of scores to be expected among the population to be tested.2. Allow funds received under this part to be used to pay for the equatingof other than norm-referenced tests to the aggregatable measure. 3. Require the evaluation results be reported for aggregation on a fall-fallor spring-spring cycle. This would not preclude LEAs from testing on afall-spring cycle as long as the data are reported on a fall-fall or spring-springbasis.4. Use the Title I Evaluation and Reporting System (TIERS) as the basicmethod to gather aggregatable data, but would allow other methods, withapproval of the SEA and the Secretary, to be used. 5. Require collection of achievement data in reading, mathematics, andlanguage arts in grades 2-12. 6. Allow SEAs and LEAs to use sampling in gathering data. 7. Require SEAs to submit the following information for all LEAs, or asample of LEAs if a sampling plan is approved by the Secretary, as partof the evaluation requirement contained in section 1019(b)(1) of the Act:(1) A statewide average of achievement gains resulting from participationin the Chapter 1 LEA Program for grades 2 through 12 in reading, mathematics,and language arts; (2) a statewide average of progress students are makingin more advanced skills in reading and in mathematics; and (3) the numberof students LEA projects excluded from the report because of missing orerroneous data and reasons for the exclusion. 8. State allowable and unallowable costs related to the evaluation of programsunder this part. The Secretary invites comments on these proposed national evaluation standards.Section 200.82 of the proposed regulations requires that an LEA evaluatestudent performance by testing achievement in the basic skill areas, includinglanguage arts. The Secretary specifically seeks comments on whether languagearts testing should be required and, if so, at what grade level languagearts becomes a basic skill area to be tested, and the appropriateness ofsuch testing at the secondary level. In addition, the Department's draft proposal also listed items to be includedin the annual collection of information by SEAs required by section 1019(b)(3)of the Act, along with additional items the Secretary believed are necessaryand helpful in constructing a picture of the impact of the Chapter 1 LEAProgram. The Department has since decided not to include this list in theregulations, but includes it here to inform SEAs and LEAs of the informationthe Department intends to collect in an annual performance report underandSection; 200.35(c). The items are: (1) The number of children participatingin the program, by grade, who attend public schools; (2) the number ofchildren participating in the program, by grade, who attend private schools;(3) the number of children in local institutions for neglected or delinquentchildren; (4) characteristics of participants, including age, gender, andethnicity; (5) the number of participants_in public schools, in privateschools, and in local institutions for neglected or delinquent children_eachby type of instructional and supporting service provided; (6) the numberof participants with handicapping conditions; (7) the number of schoolwideprojects; (8) the number of LEAs with schools undergoing program improvementunder andSection; 200.38 and the total number of LEAs with Chapter 1 programsunder this part; (9) the number of schools undergoing program improvementunder andSection; 200.38 and the total number of schools operating Chapter1 programs under this part in the State; (10) achievement data collectedfrom LEAs; and (11) the number of children receiving Chapter 1 servicesunder this part and the number of children declared eligible to receiveChapter 1 services under this part in public and in private schools. Thislast data item was added by agreement of most members of the negotiatedrulemaking group. The other items received strong support, although notfull consensus. The group requested that the Department include in the Policy Manual, requiredby section 1436 of the Act, the following: (1) A discussion of the use of appropriate norming periods for testingto ensure accurate evaluation.(2) An explanation of the need for schools to have spring test resultson first grade children to use as a base for evaluating second grade projects,and that these results would not be used for evaluating first grade projects.(3) Details on the technical standards referenced in andSection;andSection;200.81 and 200.85.The use of national evaluation standards does not satisfy the full evaluationrequirements for an LEA or SEA. Rather, as andSection; 200.35(a)(1)(ii) indicates,an LEA must use the national evaluation standards to assess student achievement.The LEA is also required in andSection; 200.35(a)(1)(i), however, to evaluatethe effectiveness of its projects under this part, in terms of basic andmore advanced skills, on the basis of the desired outcomes described inthe LEA's application. Evaluation of desired outcomes, for example, mayinclude the use of criterion-referenced tests or may measure reductionin dropout rates, improved attendance, or other indicators of program effectiveness.These requirements reflect the fact that use of national evaluation standardsalone may not provide a complete picture of the results of the Chapter1 LEA Program, particularly in the assessment of advanced skills. Further,SEAs may provide for evaluations that go beyond the minimum requirementsthat would be set by the proposed regulations in andSection; 200.80(a). Section200.35(b)(4) explicitly recognizes the SEA's authority to require LEAsto evaluate the effect of Chapter 1 projects under this part on achievementof Chapter 1 students in the regular program.<ITAG tagnum="84">Other Significant Changes Resulting From Reauthorization </ITAG><T3>Innovation projects.</T3> Section 200.4(d) of these proposed regulationsimplements the new authority under section 1011(b) of the Act for an LEAto use up to and including five percent of its allocation for seven typesof innovation projects. The provision is intended to provide more flexibilityfor LEAs in operating projects under this part and to promote program improvement.As indicated in andSection; 200.4(d)(3), with two exceptions, the requirementsof this part apply to innovation projects.<T3>LEA applications.</T3> Section 200.20(a) of the proposed regulationslists the information that an LEA must include in its application for assistance.In addition to the assurances that were previously required, the applicationmust include, for example, a description of the procedures used to conductan annual assessment of educational needs and a description of desiredoutcomes for project participants. These additions, required by section1012(b) by the Act, are necessary to implement the program improvementrequirements under sections 1020 and 1021 of the Act.<T3>Concentration grants.</T3> Sections 200.3(c) and 200.25(a) of the proposedregulations implement new criteria for counties and LEAs to be eligiblefor concentration grants. In addition, andSection; 200.25 of the proposedregulations provides procedures to allocate concentration grants to eligibleLEAs in eligible counties, to LEAs in eligible counties with no eligibleLEAs, and to LEAs in a State that receives a minimum concentration grant.That section also authorizes an SEA to reserve not more than two percentof the concentration grant funds it receives to make direct payments toeligible LEAs located in ineligible counties.<T3>Reallocation.</T3> Section 200.26 of the proposed regulations providesrevised procedures for determining whether an LEA is eligible to receivereallocated funds and for determining among all eligible LEAs those withthe greatest need for additional funds.<T3>Comparability.</T3> Section 1018(c) of the Act requires that an LEAdevelop procedures to comply with the comparability requirements and maintainrecords documenting its compliance. Section 200.43(c) of the proposed regulationsimplements the new statutory requirements. In addition, andSection; 200.43(d)of the proposed regulations requires that either the SEA or LEA establishstandards to determine that the LEA's policies result in the provisionof equivalent staffing, materials, and supplies among Chapter 1 and non-Chapter1 schools in the LEA.<T3>Exclusions from the supplement-not-supplant and comparability requirements.</T3>Section 200.45 of the proposed regulations continues the current provisionthat allows an LEA to exclude (1) State and local funds spent for compensatoryeducation from determinations of compliance with the supplement-not-supplantand comparability requirements; and (2) State and local funds spent forbilingual education, special education, and State ``phase-in'' programsfrom determinations of compliance with the comparability requirement. Section1018(d) of the Act requires that the Secretary determine in advance thatState programs meet certain requirements to be excluded and that the SEAmake similar determinations for local programs. Section 200.45 (b) and(c) of the proposed regulations implements these new statutory requirements.<T3>Participation of children in private schools.</T3> The proposed regulationsimplement three changes made in section 1017 of the Act concerning theparticipation of children in private schools. In enacting these changes,Congress sought to ameliorate the adverse effects of the Supreme Court'sdecision in <T3>Aguilar</T3> v. <T3>Felton</T3> on the quality and level of educational services providedto private school children. First, andSection; 200.50(b) implements the provisionin section 1017(b)(3)(A) that authorizes parents, teachers, and other concernedindividuals or organizations to file complaints with the Secretary allegingthat an LEA has failed to meet its obligation to provide equitable servicesto children enrolled in private schools. As andSection; 200.50(b)(3) indicates,the Secretary investigates a complaint and issues a letter of finding within120 days. Second, andSection; 200.51 implements the requirement_made explicitin section 1017(a) of the Act_that an LEA must engage in ``timely and meaningfulconsultation'' with appropriate private school officials. Third, andSection;andSection;200.56-200.58 implement section 1017(d) regarding capital expenses. Congressspecifically authorized payments for capital expenses to reduce the financialstrain on LEAs that must pay for alternative delivery systems for privateschool children as a result of the <T3>Felton</T3> decision. As andSection; 200.56 indicates, from funds appropriatedfor capital expenses, the Secretary pays each State an amount based onthe number of private school children in the State served under Chapter1 of the ECIA during the period July 1, 1984 through June 30, 1985. AnLEA may apply to the SEA for these payments to cover capital expenses theLEA has paid from funds under this part and Chapter 1 of the ECIA fundssince July 1, 1985, is currently paying, or would incur in order to provideservices to additional private school children. Capital expenses are definedin andSection; 200.57(a)(2) as only expenditures for noninstructional goodsand services incurred as a result of the <T3>Felton</T3> decision. They do not include the purchase of instructionalequipment such as computers. The SEA must distribute funds it receivesfor capital expenses on the basis of need, using criteria such as thosein andSection; 200.57(c).In addition to these changes, the proposed regulations also include twoprovisions to clarify certain requirements following the <T3>Felton</T3> decision. First, in andSection; 200.52 concerning equal expenditures,paragraph (a)(2) makes clear that an LEA must pay for reasonable and necessaryadministrative costs of providing services to public and private schoolchildren from the LEA's whole allocation received under this part. Second,andSection; 200.52(b)(2) describes factors to be used to determine whetherthe services being provided to private school children are equitable. Finally,also in response to <T3>Felton,</T3> the proposed regulations delete the provision currentlyin andSection; 200.73 concerning use of public school personnel in otherthan public facilities.<T3>State complaint procedures.</T3> Section 200.72 of the proposed regulationshas been added to require States to develop and implement procedures forresolving complaints at the State and local levels. The Secretary has addedthis section in response to language in the conference report accompanyingthe Hawkins-Stafford Act recommending that the Secretary ``issue amendedregulations making 34 CFR 76.780-783 applicable to Chapter 1.'' H.R. Rept.567, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. 341 (1988). The Secretary has proposed, in apreviously published notice of proposed rulemaking, to remove the complaintprocedures from Part 76 and to retain those procedures only in regulationsfor the specific programs to which they apply. Rather than repeating thecomplaint provisions currently in Part 76, however, the Secretary has attemptedin andSection; 200.72 to implement the conferees' intent that States developand implement procedures to resolve complaints while affording States maximumflexibility in tailoring those procedures to fit State and local needs.<ITAG tagnum="84">Applicability of EDGAR</ITAG>As indicated in andSection; 200.5(a), the Secretary proposes to make therelevant parts of EDGAR applicable to programs under this part. In makingthis proposal, the Secretary is responding to a need for additional guidance.During the six years that EDGAR has not been applicable under Chapter 1of the ECIA, SEAs and LEAs have asked the Department numerous questionsthat are answered by the provisions in EDGAR. Moreover, without the benefitof the guidance in EDGAR, a number of States have incurred audit exceptionsconcerning fiscal control and fund accountability. The Secretary believesthat making the relevant parts of EDGAR applicable to programs under thispart will address the need for better guidance and accountability. Moreover,the Secretary does not believe this action will create additional burdenfor SEAs and LEAs because EDGAR is applicable to other State-administeredFederal education programs and has recently been reviewed with respectto federalism issues and burden reduction, and unduly burdensome requirementshave been revised or removed.Specifically, the Secretary proposes to apply Part 76 (State-AdministeredPrograms), with certain exceptions; Part 77 (Definitions that Apply toDepartment Regulations); and Part 78 (Education Appeal Board). In addition,regulations implementing the new enforcement provisions in Part E of theGeneral Education Provisions Act would apply when those regulations arepromulgated. Further, the Secretary proposes in andSection; 200.5(a)(4) toapply Part 80 (Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and CooperativeAgreements to State and Local Governments), unless a State formally adoptsits own written fiscal and administrative requirements for expending andaccounting for funds received by the SEA and its LEAs under this part.If a State does not have its own written requirements implemented by July1, 1989, but wishes to develop them, the requirements in Part 80 wouldapply until such time as written requirements are formally adopted. Ifa State chooses to apply its own written requirements, those requirementsmust be available for Federal inspection. In a case where departmentalofficials determine that a State's requirements are not sufficient, theenforcement provisions in Part E of GEPA would apply, including the dueprocess provisions in that part. During the transition period providedfor in section 1491(c) of the Act (July 1, 1988-June 30, 1989), a Statemay continue to comply with the requirements under Chapter 1 of the ECIA.The Secretary specifically invites comments on andSection; 200.5(a)(4).<ITAG tagnum="84">Enforcement Procedures</ITAG>Section 3501 of the Hawkins-Stafford Act amended Part E of GEPA to providefor new enforcement procedures. The amended Part E requires the Secretaryto establish an Office of Administrative Law Judges (OALJ) to replace theexisting Education Appeal Board and sets out new hearing procedures. 20U.S.C. 1234-1234i. With the exception of provisions regarding withholdingactions and judicial review of those actions, which are superseded by sections1433 and 1434 of the Act, Part E applies to the Chapter 1 LEA Program.As a result, appeals from cost disallowance decisions, received by an SEAon or after October 25, 1988, as well as most other enforcement proceedingsunder the Chapter 1 LEA Program, will be heard by the OALJ. Proposed regulationsimplementing Part E will address whether withholding actions under theChapter 1 LEA Program will also be heard by the OALJ. The Education AppealBoard will continue to hear appeals from determinations under the Chapter1 LEA Program received by an SEA before October 25.<ITAG tagnum="84">Procedures for Bypass</ITAG>Under a number of elementary and secondary education programs reauthorizedby the Hawkins-Stafford Act_namely, Chapters 1 and 2 of Title I of theElementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as amended, the DwightD. Eisenhower Mathematics and Science Education Act, and Part B of theDrug-Free Schools and Communities Act of 1986_the Secretary is authorizedto waive the requirements for providing services to private school childrenand to implement a bypass. The procedures that the Secretary would usein implementing a bypass under these programs are virtually identical.Rather than repeating the same procedures in a number of sets of regulations,therefore, the Secretary proposes to add procedures for bypass in andSection;andSection;76.671-76.677 of EDGAR that would apply to each program listed in andSection;76.670.<ITAG tagnum="84">Cooperation with Audits</ITAG>The proposed regulations include two new sections concerning cooperationwith audits that would be added to Parts 75 and 76 of EDGAR, respectively.These sections make clear that grantees and subgrantees must cooperatewith the Secretary and the Comptroller General of the United States ortheir authorized representatives in the conduct of audits. This cooperationincludes access to records and personnel of the grantee and subgranteefor the purpose of obtaining relevant information, a requirement formerlycontained in 34 CFR 204.11(a) (Chapter 1 of the ECIA) and 34 CFR 298.16(a)(Chapter 2 of the ECIA). Because access to records and personnel is essentialin all Department programs, the Secretary proposes to clarify that theaccess to records and personnel must be without unreasonable restrictions.Examples that may constitute unreasonable restrictions that would not resultin access include limiting written or oral information to be supplied,requiring the presence of a third person at an audit interview, or requiringthat an audit interview be tape recorded.The Secretary proposes these provisions because of concern about attemptsby some grantees to impose unreasonble restrictions on auditors' accessto the grantee's records or personnel. For example, some grantees havemaintained that restrictions on access to personnel are necessary to ensurean accurate record of communications between their personnel and the auditors.The Secretary considers these restrictions to be incompatible with soundaudit practice because they could discourage the complete and accuratedisclosure of relevant information by a grantee's personnel. The Department'sestablished audit procedures are designed to promote accuracy. Safeguardsfor grantees include ongoing access to the auditors in the course of theaudit, an exit conference at the end of the field work, inviting the auditeeto comment on and correct a draft audit report, and including the auditee'scomments on the draft audit report in the final audit report. All interviewswith personnel are summarized in the audit workpapers and the summariescan be made available to the auditee and to the interviewed person reasonablysoon after the interview. Whistle-blowing disclosures by the interviewedperson are not included in written summaries in order to protect the personfrom employer reprisal. It is important to note, however, that unattributedstatements by personnel are not used as the basis for audit findings, butonly as a source enabling the auditors to obtain objective informationthat would be available to the auditee. The proposed language in Parts75 and 76 makes it clear that the grantee's or subgrantee's obligationto cooperate with audits means not imposing unreasonable restrictions onaccess to records and personnel. Comments concerning these provisions willbe referred to the Office of Inspector General for consideration.<ITAG tagnum="84">Removal of Part 204</ITAG>The Secretary proposes in these regulations to remove Part 204, which containsgeneral definitions and administrative, project, fiscal, and due processrequirements for all Chapter 1 programs. Part 204 was originally promulgatedto consolidate provisions that applied to all of the Chapter 1 programsto avoid repeating identical requirements in each set of regulations. Underthe reauthorization, however, there are far fewer requirements that applyin the same way to each Chapter 1 program. Moreover, because the Secretaryis proposing to make relevant provisions of EDGAR applicable, a numberof common provisions currently contained in Part 204 would be governedby EDGAR. The Secretary believes, therefore, that a separate Part 204 isno longer necessary. Instead, all common requirements not contained inEDGAR will be included in the regulations implementing each specific Chaper1 program, thereby reducing the number of documents with which the SEAor LEA must deal.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291</ITAG>These proposed regulations have been reviewed in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12291. They are not classified as major because they do not meetthe criteria for major regulations established in the order.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12606</ITAG>The Secretary certifies that these proposed regulations have been reviewedin accordance with Executive Order 12606 and that they do not have a significantnegative impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being.To the contrary, the Chapter 1 LEA program supports and strengthens thefamily by containing strong parental involvement requirements. Specifically,an LEA develop, in coordination with parents of participating children,programs, activities, and procedures to: inform parents about the Chapter1 LEA program; support the efforts of parents, including training parentsto work with their children at home; train teachers and other staff towork effectively with parents; consult with parents on an ongoing basis;and provide opportunities for the full participation of parents who lackliteracy skills or whose native language is not English. Funds receivedunder this part may be used to support these activities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification</ITAG>The Secretary certifies that these proposed regulations would not havea significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.The small entities that would be affected by these proposed regulationsare small LEAs receiving Federal funds under this part. However, the regulationswould not have a significant economic impact on the small LEAs affectedbecause the regulations would not impose excessive regulatory burdens orrequire unnecessary Federal supervision. The regulations would impose minimalrequirements to ensure the proper expenditure of program funds.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980</ITAG>Sections 200.10, 200.20, 200.35, 200.36, 200.37, 200.38, 200.43, 200.57,200.80, 200.84, and 200.87 contain information collection requirements.As required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, the Department of Educationwill submit a copy of these sections to the Office of Management and Budgetfor its review. (44 U.S.C. 3504(h))Organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments on the informationcollection requirements should direct them to the Office of Informationand Regulatory Affairs, Room 3002, New Executive Office Building, Washington,DC 20503, Attention: James D.
