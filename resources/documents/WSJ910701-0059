A whole quarter's good performance was being eaten awayby a rout in computer stocks, which make up 12% of hisportfolio.   &quot;Compaq {Computer} alone has cost us two percentage pointsyear-to-date&quot; in overall performance, sighs Mr. Dreman,chairman of Dreman Value Management L.P., which manages $3.9billion from Jersey City, N.J. &quot;I wished they closed thequarter a week earlier.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   He surely must be jettisoning computer shares. Nope. He'sbuying more: &quot;We've added some Compaq,&quot; he says.   Mr. Dreman is a vocal &quot;value&quot; investor, the kind ofcontrarian who sifts through the rubble of market or sectorpanics in search of oversold investment gems. Over the pastfive years, &quot;value&quot; has been out of favor on Wall Street. Itmeant buying ho-hum banking, auto, chemicals, metals andpaper stocks. In 1988, forecasters began to get a whiff of aneconomic slowdown, and these stocks tied to the economiccycle went down -- and kept falling right through 1990.Meanwhile, growth stocks were the market darlings.   But as this quarter's industry group performance shows,many cyclical stocks are riding high. Of the top 10best-performing groups last quarter, seven are cyclical.Growth groups, such as health care and household products,lagged behind the market badly in the second quarter by 8.7%and 5.6%, respectively.   As for the revenge of the cyclicals, &quot;I think this couldgo on for quite some time,&quot; Mr. Dreman says, speaking aboutthe rally in banking, financial-services and other formerlydowntrodden shares.   Mr. Dreman's average account is up 14.4% this year,compared with a 14.2% total return on Standard andamp; Poor's500-stock index for the six months. Since the market lowslast October, his average account is up 28.2% vs. 24.4% onthe Sandamp;P 500. While his portfolios are sprinkled with familiargrowth names, such as Philip Morris and McDonald's, the heavyconcentrations are in stocks that would be inadmissible toany respectable growth portfolio: Barnett Banks, Chrysler,Ford Motor, James River Corp., Scott Paper.   &quot;A lot of these stocks have done nothing in five years,&quot;says Mr. Dreman; they have &quot;made value a non-parlor word.&quot;   Being quietly shunned by the parlor society of investorsis easier to take than being trampled on Wall Street byshortsellers.   To appreciate the nerve-wracking methods of a valueinvestor, consider what Mr. Dreman endured last October whenhe started building his position in Barnett Banks, OhioCasualty and other out-of-favor stocks. The only sellers backthen were the shorts, or speculators who sold borrowed sharesin a bet they could buy them back later more cheaply.   &quot;The shorts were all over our stocks,&quot; Mr. Dreman recalls.His day was often interrupted with panicky phone calls fromfriends or clients with rumors that later proved spurious:&quot;Did you hear? The word is that Ohio Casualty's junk-bondportfolio is going to sink them]&quot; Or, &quot;Did you hear? BarnettBanks is going to be seized by banking regulators]&quot;   Weekly investment meetings at Dreman Value Managementturned from polite discussions about value into daily debatesover how to defend the portfolio. Should they sell shares toraise cash? Shouldn't they sell their bank stocks? Was itwise to sell the rising oil stocks and switch into tumblingairline shares?   &quot;It is hard when your portfolios are being chopped up notto get a little defensive,&quot; he says. But Mr. Dreman and hispartners stuck by their stocks. The rewards: Barnett Banks isup 85% since last October, and Ohio Casualty is up 74%.   Confidence in the face of adversity is a hallmark of anyvalue investor. While cyclical stocks have had an impressiverun this year, they haven't fared well lately. Thepossibility of negative surprises in second-quarter earningshas sent the less faithful scurrying. Stocks were down lastweek; the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 58.81 points, or1.98%. Among the worst-performing industry groups for theweek were auto makers, forest products and regional banks.   Mr. Dreman acknowledges the problems: &quot;In technology,there is a panic,&quot; he says. Auto stocks? &quot;The fundamentals inthe autos are worse than we thought. Ford hasn't only beenhit domestically with slower sales, but they have largeforeign earnings that were also hurt badly last year.&quot; Bankstocks, as last week showed, are still under sellingpressure.   But he will sell no auto, technology or bank stocks beforetheir time. &quot;Often the near-term fundamentals are bad, but inthe long-term they are good,&quot; he says. &quot;By all the yardsticksof value, there are a lot of cheap stocks here.&quot;   Rather than discussing broad groups, Mr. Dreman prefers tospeak about specific stocks, in which he is confident thatthe value will be &quot;proven&quot; by these companies' higherearnings in about a year.   &quot;Financial service companies are still very cheap,&quot; hesays. A recent favorite is Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.,trading at around 11 times the past four quarters ofearnings. He says mortgage-backed securities, which &quot;FreddieMac&quot; sells, are in greater demand by banks, which are makingfewer loans. &quot;It is a good, steady, solid growth company,&quot; hesays.   Mr. Dreman would think about adding to his positions inBarnett Banks, PNC Financial and First Union. He says bankstocks are up from extreme lows, &quot;and there seems to be a lotof recovery to come&quot; in price over the next several months.&quot;The stocks are trading at low P-Es,&quot; he adds.   He is confident that U.S. auto makers &quot;could showexcellent earnings&quot; if car sales begin to climb a bit. Autoindustry shares were up 8.3% in the second quarter, and 23.8%in the first half.   Then there are computer stocks, which clobbered hisportfolios in April and June.   &quot;There has been an enormous over-reaction&quot; in stocks suchas Compaq, he says. Compaq is down 45% this year. But such isthe faith of a seasoned value manager that when Compaqstarted to tumble, Mr. Dreman and his staff did theirhomework on the personal computer market and decided itwasn't vanishing. Long-term trends, aren't against Compaq,Mr. Dreman concluded. &quot;Does this stock have a chance of stillbeing a leader? Is {personal computing} likely to be a growtharea?&quot; he asks. &quot;The answer is yes.&quot;   While it has been a fine quarter for value investors, Mr.Dreman says investment money is still flowing out of thisschool and into the hands of growth-stock managers. But Mr.Dreman thinks the second quarter may be the first sign of achanging tide.   ---   Friday's Market Activity                                                                                                          A sick stock market in Tokyo, a fragile recovery at homeand rumors of big bank problems combined to drive stockprices lower in the last trading day of the second quarter.   The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 28.18 points toclose at 2906.75 in active trading. Volume on the New YorkStock Exchange totaled 162.7 million shares. Declining issueson the Big Board were ahead of gainers 901 to 677. For theweek the Dow industrials were off 58.81 points, or 1.98%.   The trading day in New York started badly after stocks inTokyo fell more than 1%. It was the second big loss this weekfor Tokyo stocks in the wake of a scandal involving four bigsecurities firms that reimbursed big clients for tradinglosses. U.S. investors worry that as Japanese investors sellstocks there, they may also pull back from the U.S. market.   Adding to the downdraft was the Chicago PurchasingManagement Association's June survey of area businessconditions showing a modest decline, indicating the regionaleconomy is still contracting. The Chicago index, a prelude tothe national survey of purchasing managers to be releasedtoday, raises questions about how robust any economicrecovery may be.   Shares of cyclical companies, those whose fortunes areclosely tied to the economic cycle, were hammered. BethlehemSteel lost 5/8 to 16 1/8; International Paper was off 1 3/8to 70 1/2; Westinghouse fell 7/8 to 27 7/8; Caterpillartumbled 1 1/8 to 49 3/8 and General Motors closed at 40 3/4,down 1/2.   Investors also were alarmed by the continuing problemsplaguing big banks. Earlier in the week Wells Fargo stunnedinvestors when it indicated problem loans were much worsethan expected. Chase Manhattan Corp. tumbled 1 1/8 to 16 1/4on rumors the big bank was having funding problems. Chasedenied the rumors. Other big money center banks were off,although not as sharply. Chemical Banking fell 5/8 to 21 3/8,Citicorp slipped 1/8 to 14 1/2, J.P. Morgan was off 1/4 to 521/8 and Bankers Trust fell 7/8 to 48 3/8.   Other losers Friday included Eastman Kodak, off 1 to 383/4; Merck, down 2 3/8 to 116 1/8; Sears Roebuck, off 3/4 to37 7/8, and Philip Morris, which fell 5/8 to 63 1/2.</TEXT></DOC>
