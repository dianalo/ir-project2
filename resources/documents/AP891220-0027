North's testimonywill make it more difficult to prosecute John Poindexter, says aformer chief counsel to the congressional Iran-Contra committees.   U.S. District Court Judge Harold Greene ruled Tuesday thatNorth's statements at his own trial are off-limits for use in thePoindexter case.   North testified in April that he saw the former nationalsecurity adviser tear up a presidential finding retroactivelylegalizing CIA assistance for a November 1985 shipment of Hawkmissiles to Iran.   But North testified last week that his recollection on that andother matters was influenced by Poindexter's immunized appearanceon Capitol Hill in 1987. Therefore, said Greene, North's trialtestimony as it relates to Poindexter may not be used, unless itwas a subject which Poindexter didn't address in his immunizedtestimony.   The court's obligations require it to ``err on the side ofprotecting Poindexter's constitutional right not to be convictedwith the use of his own testimony,'' said the judge.   Prosecutors ``may only elicit evidence'' from North based on hisstatements prior to July 15, 1987, the day Poindexter begantestifying on Capitol Hill, said the judge.   By saying he was tainted, North ``has snaked his way around''the issue of having to testify about the finding being torn up,said John Nields, former chief counsel to the House majority staffin the congressional Iran-Contra hearings.   Since North did not tell the congressional committees in 1987that he saw Poindexter destroy the finding, he ``won't be able totestify to it at the (Poindexter) trial'' and ``I don't think thegovernment has any other proof of it,'' said Nields.   The government still could elicit information about thefinding's being torn up if Poindexter decides to testify in his ownbehalf at his trial, which is scheduled to begin Jan. 22.   The destruction of the finding relates to four of the criminalcharges against the former national security adviser. He is accusedof conspiracy, two counts of obstructing Congress and two counts ofmaking false statements.   Poindexter destroyed the December 1985 finding on Nov. 21, 1986,the same day he allegedly told Congress that no one in the U.S.government knew until early 1986 that the shipment had carried Hawkmissiles.   The prosecution says the finding which Poindexter destroyed is``the most critical document in proving the falsity'' of anotherdocument, a chronology which is an essential part of thegovernment's case against Poindexter. The chronology contains thesame false information which Poindexter allegedly gave to Congress_ that no one in the government knew about the Hawk shipment until1986.   Paul Thompson, the National Security Council's legal counsel,was present when Poindexter tore up the finding.   But Thompson said in a deposition to Congress in August 1987that he didn't realize at the time it was the finding thatPoindexter was destroying.   ``One document we came to he ripped up ... saying `This is nolonger necessary' or `this has no future,''' Thompson recalled inhis deposition to Congress. ``That document turns out to have beenthe finding.'' Thompson said he learned it was the finding when hesaw Poindexter admit it on television in his immunized testimony.   North was convicted in May of three felonies in the Iran-Contraaffair. He is appealing the convictions on charges of altering anddestroying documents, accepting an illegal gratuity and aiding andabetting an obstruction of Congress.   The obstruction charge was related to a November 1985 shipmentof Hawks to Iran, which also forms the basis of some of the chargesin the Poindexter case.</TEXT></DOC>
