Co., are subsidizingsuppliers of proprietary systems--robbing, if you will, their UNIXcounterparts of deserved profits.andP;  &quot;Users say there is a higher value to opensystems,&quot; Shaffner says.andP;  &quot;But to date they have not paid for it.&quot;andM;As wishful as Shaffner sounds that things may change for the better, usersare in fact unlikely to pay bigger bucks for open systems in the future.andO;&quot;Customers of UNIX systems want to have their cake and eat it too,&quot; says DonTapscott, vice president of Boston-based consulting and systems integrationfirm DMR Group, which has just concluded an exhaustive study of thepurchasing behavior of open systems users.andP;  &quot;They want commodity pricing,maximum performance and all of the hand-holding and other services thatthey've been long accustomed to.&quot;andM;If suppliers are unable to adjust their business models in line with whatusers are willing to pay for UNIX systems, it will be several years beforethe open world becomes a very profitable one.andP;  By then, only a handful ofworld-class UNIX hardware suppliers will have survived--with two or threecoming from the United States, one or two from Europe and perhaps as many asfour from Japan.andP;  The source of innovation for users will have shifted almostcompletely from processors to the software and services attached to them.andM;Those are the signs ahead on the open systems road.andP;  Whether they lead yourorganization to the destination it must reach to survive the 1990s isanybody's guess.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
