The core point of her criticism of the Treuhand's policy,that the profit motive is not sufficiently stressed, revealsa misperception of the nature and guiding principles of theGerman economic system. A social market economy differsgreatly from the American in both regards.</LP><TEXT>   The social aspects have always been as important --perhaps more important -- than the profit motive. Not only isthe social-welfare net essential, not only does a &quot;socialpartnership&quot; exist between employers and the employed (a petpeeve of Margaret Thatcher, by the way), but more broadly theeconomic system rests upon an implicit social contract, inwhich employers, the employed (through their unions), thegovernment and, less clearly, the Central Bank are allpartners.   In the case of East Germany, moreover, not just thepolitical but an explicit constitutional obligation for thegovernment to &quot;equalize living conditions&quot; throughout thecountry comes into play. That is a social, a redistributiverequirement. It serves as the rationale for the massivetransfer of resources from West to East. The $200 billion infederal spending to support the Treuhand, which Miss Shlaesmentions, is but a small fraction of those massive transfers.   The social and redistributive aspects of the Germaneconomic system go back to the earliest days of the FederalRepublic (indeed much earlier -- to the 1880s). Yes, &quot;thingswere different in postwar Germany.&quot; They were far moresocially, even socialistically, oriented than today.   Not just the Social Democrats of the time, the ChristianDemocrats also advocated socialistic approaches. Rememberthat the redistributive policies and huge reinforcement ofthe social-welfare state occurred in the 1950s under theChristian Democrats at the height of their power.   Bundestag legislation introduced by the CDU in many fieldsin the early 1950s greatly strengthened the social,redistributive and regulatory elements of the social marketeconomy. The Christian Democrats of the era were much moreheavily influenced by Christian social thought than they aretoday. They bought onto schemes such as co-determination inthe steel and coal industry, which they wouldn't do today.   The &quot;instinct&quot; of the Treuhand to which Miss Shlaes refersis the instinct of 90% of Germany's political leaders. Besure of that.   I doubt that &quot;many&quot; in Germany think East Germany is to besaved through the profit motive alone. If there were in factmany who think so, we would be hearing a great outcry againstthe huge subsidization program for the East German economy.All you hear is grumbling in a few quarters, mainly among thepolitical leaders of the Western states.   Only in one regard, perhaps, can we say that in today'seconomy the state plays a clearer role than it did fourdecades ago -- in its large-scale subsidization program. Oneneed not even make the political (&quot;we are threatened bysocial unrest&quot;) argument to defend the job-preserving, highlyregulated, massively subsidized redistributive and sociallyconscious way the Germans run their economy.   With their kind of economy, the Germans have over recentyears done better than we Americans have with ours. How toexplain that?
