(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker returned totelevision today after a two-year absence with a show broadcast fromthe living room of their borrowed home to a handful of stationsaround the country.   ``Jim, I think this is probably the happiest day of my life,''Mrs. Bakker said as the show began. Sporting her trademark heavy eyemakeup, she began crying two minutes into the hourlong show.   Bakker, the founder of PTL, left his television ministry in March1987 in the midst of a sex and money scandal. He and his wife hadnot appeared on a television pulpit since January 1987.   Today, Bakker told viewers and his supporters crowded into thehouse that his last television appearance was to break ground forthe Crystal Palace Church at Heritage USA, the home of PTL.   ``I believe that was the last straw for Satan,'' Bakker said. ``Ithink the devil was mad that something so beautiful was being built.... I believe the devil said, `I have to smash Jim and TammyBakker.'''   Bakker said he believes that church, which was designed to hold30,000 people, still will be built.   But since the Bakkers left the PTL organization, it has filed forprotection under federal bankruptcy laws, and last month abankruptcy judge ordered its assets sold to a Canadian businessman.Also last month, Bakker and a former top aide were indicted oncharges including fraud and conspiracy.   Bakker thanked a supporter who had donated the money to put himback on the air, and said the program would be carried by morestations next month. It is scheduled to be shown Monday throughFriday.   ``We bought time,'' Mrs. Bakker said. ``We had a certain amountof money and that's all the time we could buy, and it's not a lot ofmoney, but it got us back on the air and we are so grateful.''   Bakker did not make any direct appeal for donations, in markedcontrast to his old ```PTL Club'' show. He did give an address inFort Mill, S.C., ``if you want to write us.''   Callers to a telephone number _ not toll-free _ shown throughoutthe show were asked to give their name, phone number and address butgot no appeal for funds. The callers were invited to ask the Bakkersto pray for them.   Bakker, who turned 49 today, said the program was being carriedby television stations in Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Albany, N.Y.;Akron and Canton, Ohio; Asheville, N.C.; and Louisiana.   In Amsterdam, N.Y., near Albany, WOCD general manager FredWuenschel said the Bakkers paid ``the usual rate per hour'' to be onthe station. He wouldn't say what that was.   The station has a 30-day contract for the show. He said he willkeep the show on ``as long as they keep paying.''   The only mention of Bakker's legal troubles came when the gueston the show, former PTL songwriter Mike Murdock, said he wrote onesong in a lawyer's office. Murdock said he knew Bakker ``didn't knowanything about lawyers.''   ``Oh no-o-o-o,'' Bakker said with a chuckle.   Bakker said he had a message for ``hurting people'' and thatviewers should keep their faith no matter what crisis they werefacing.   ``If Jim and Tammy can survive their holocaust of the last twoyears, then you can make it,'' Bakker said.</TEXT></DOC>
