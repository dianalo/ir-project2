Moran said Tuesday afterbeing told that the Department of Housing and Urban Development hadgranted the District of Columbia suburb an exemption from federalhousing grievance regulations.   Moran said the exemption, requested after the killing of apolice officer and a drug-seeking gunman outside a housing projecta week ago, was needed to eliminate time-consuming and costlyregulations that discouraged local officials from pursuingevictions.   Without the exemption, HUD regulations required local governmentofficials to allow tenants threatened with evictions to appealfirst to a federal administrative panel and then to the courts.   ``Our review of the Virginia statutes indicated a system ofopportunities for two full trials ... a full range of due processguarantees,'' HUD general counsel-designate Frank Keating said inexplaining the agency's decision.   Although the exemption is directed at Alexandria, Keating said``the law is the same throughout the state (of Virginia) and ifother housing authorities had chronic drug activity'' they couldexpect to be exempted as well.   However Keating said the exemption would be limited to evictionsinvolving ``drug and drug-related activity.''   Last month, HUD Secretary Jack Kemp sent a memo to the directorsof the nation's 3,300 public housing authorities asking them toreport on steps they were taking to combat the drug trade on theirproperties.   Kemp pledged ``to assist you and law-abiding residents ineliminating this plague from public housing.''   ``We're not going to take any chances on evicting anybody thatmight prove innocent,'' said Mayor Moran, explaining that the citywould pursue evictions only in those cases where they have currentevidence ``of criminal activity either committed by or condoned bythe the public housing leaseholder.''   ``We're going to take advantage of it in both responsible andexpeditious way to be a model for other housing authorities,'' hesaid.   Moran said police had a list of 45 people in the city's publichousing units who were targeted.   The city sought the exemption at a meeting with HUD officials onMonday in the wake of a hostage-taking and fatal shootout at apublic housing development in the Old Town section.   Last week Jamie Martin Wise, 34, an escapee from a Washington,D.C., halfway house entered an apartment in the development,demanded crack cocaine and held five people hostage.   Wise later released four of the hostages but emerged from thebuilding with the fifth hostage at gunpoint. Wise was shot by apolice sharpshooter and fatally wounded police Cpl. Charles W. Hillbefore succumbing to his own wounds. Another officer was wounded.   Moran said the city was granted the exemption afterdemonstrating to HUD officials that state law would insure tenantsfacing eviction would receive due process without the inclusion ofsome federal regulatory requirements.   He said tenants would retain their rights to appeal evictions infederal and district court with the options of a trial by jury orcivil discovery.   ``There's a substantial protection already in the law,'' Moransaid.   But a lawyer who won an injunction in federal court last Januaryagainst new HUD regulations that included granting exemptions tothe grievance procedures disagreed.   ``I think HUD doesn't have the right to grant the waiver,'' saidDavid Bryson of the National Law Housing Center in Berkeley, Calif.   ``There is a serious question whether their granting the waiverwould be in contempt'' of the injunction, said Bryson.   ``The injunction that the judge entered does not cover thesespecific issues. It had to do with (withholding) the publication ofthe new grievance procedures until a number of features wereincorporated with tenant input,'' Keating countered.   Maria Foscarinis, an attorney for the National Coalition for theHomeless, an homeless advocacy group, said, ``The concern with drugactivity in public housing is understandable but the response seemsa little out of proportion.''</TEXT></DOC>
