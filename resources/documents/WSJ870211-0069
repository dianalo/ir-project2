In a related transaction, CalMat agreed to sell for approximately $12.9 million the about 200 acres of land on which Valley Reclamation conducts its landfill operations to the Waste Management unit. That sale will be completed sometime later this year. The land is located in California's San Fernando Valley.    CalMat, a producer of concrete and other construction materials, said it will record a pre-tax gain of about $42 million for the first quarter from its sale of Valley Reclamation. It also expects to record an $8 million pre-tax gain later this year upon completion of the land transaction.    Scott J. Wilcott, senior vice president of CalMat, said the company is selling the sanitary landfill operation because it doesn't fit into current company operations. </TEXT></DOC>
