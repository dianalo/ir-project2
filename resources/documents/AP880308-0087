Riot and security police arrived outside the Chamber of Minesabout 10 minutes after the peaceful protest began and the crowdbegan to disperse.   Police began taking journalists into custody, including crewmembers of the American network, CBS, and London-based WorldTelevision News, and taking film out of photographers' cameras.   Soundman Prince Msuthu of World Television News said policepunched him with fists and poked him in the stomach with theirbatons. He said he had bruises on his arms and intended to filecharges.   Other journalists saw police dragging him toward the vehicle andholding him in a wrist-lock.   ``They were manhandling me, pushing me around up to the pointwhere the recorder on my shoulder fell on the ground,'' he said.``They put me into the truck and as I was getting into the truckone of them assaulted me, using the baton.   ``They kept on punching me, saying that I am `cheeky,' '' Msuthusaid after he was released from police custody and his recordedcassette confiscated.   Police spokesman Col. Frans Malherbe said police took ninejournalists to police headquarters and confiscated their film. Buthe denied they were detained or arrested. He said they could facecharges ``if they have done something wrong.''   ``We arrived on the scene and had to deal with the news peoplesomehow. ... so we took them to an office at John Vorster Square,''he said, adding that emergency regulations prohibit members of thenews media from being at the scene of unrest.   However, journalists at the scene disputed Malherbe's statementthat police gave notice the gathering was illegal.   The protesters, members of the Federation of Transvaal Women,called on the nation's largest mining houses and biggest foreigncurrency earners to take a tougher line against governmentrestrictions on anti-apartheid organizations.   The women sang ``God Bless Africa,'' and unfurled postersaddressed to the chamber saying: ``Your Silence is Conspiracy,''``Bannings Protect Mine Profits,'' ``Unban Democracy,'' and``Chamber of Mines Speak.''   The women's federation is an affiliate of the United DemocraticFront, one of 18 organizations the government banned on Feb. 24from any political activity.   The Congress of South African Trade Unions, whose biggestaffiliate is the 300,000-member black national Union ofMineworkers, was also banned from any political activity.   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregatedsociety in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in nationalaffairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintainseparate districts, schools and health services.</TEXT></DOC>
