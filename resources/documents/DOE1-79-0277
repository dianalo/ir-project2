The long-term goals of theresearch are to provide methods and software to assure that the specificationsare consistent, correct, and complete. The research described differsfrom previous research in several ways. First, the natural language inputis used to construct an internal design representation, rather than justto query about existing design data. Second, using natural language allowsa generality of expression not found in formal models. Finally, the naturallanguage is not overly restricted. A major part of the research involvesformally modeling the information found in system specifications. Anextension of the USC Design Data Structure is described, with emphasison timing and control flow. A semantic parser, PHRAN,is used as the basisfor the actual interface software. PHRAN contains a knowledge base ofsentence patterns along with associated concepts. PHRAN inputs Englishsentences and looks for patterns in the sentences. When it finds a patternmatch, the concept associated with the pattern is particularized withthe information found in the sentence.</TEXT></DOC>
