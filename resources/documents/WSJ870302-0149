Both trusts said the reductions resulted from the decline in energy prices.    Houston Oil Royalty said Keplinger andamp; Associates Inc., Houston, cut the trust's estimated future revenue from its proved oil and gas reserves 23% to $10.9 million. However, Keplinger revised upward its estimates of the reserves held by the trust. Keplinger estimated that, as of Oct. 31, 1986, the trust's proved oil reserves increased 3% to 184,000 barrels and natural gas reserves increased 8% to 4.42 billion cubic feet.    LLandamp;E said Gruy Engineering Corp., Irving, Texas, slashed the estimate of the trust's future revenue 64% to about $57 million, based on prices as of Sept. 30, 1986. LLandamp;E said Gruy increased its estimates of the amount of oil and gas owned by the trust, but LLandamp;E didn't specify the increases.    In composite trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, Houston Oil Royalty shares closed at $5.125, unchanged, and LLandamp;E shares closed at $9.375, unchanged. </TEXT></DOC>
