 The CD-ROM Expo in Boston, October 2-3, 1990, gave us achance to sample the state of the art.andM;Advocates of CD-ROM, you may remember, dubbed it &quot;the new papyrus.&quot;andP;  Theirenthusiasm was not without foundation, being based upon factors such asthese:andM;* Storage.andP;  Each laser-read five-inch-diameter CD-ROM disc can store 700megabytes of data, the equivalent of several hundred books.andP;  The enormousreduction in weight and volume can save shipping costs and shelf space andproduce an obvious gain in portability.andM;* Price of drives.andP;  CD-ROM drives are affordable; they are now in the$400-1,000 price range.andM;* Price of replication.andP;  Disc replication is inexpensive.andP;  Replication plantscharge something like $2.00 to press and package each ROM disc and less than$2,000 to prepare the master.andP;  Costs compare very favorably with print onpaper or telecommunications.andM;* Accessibility.andP;  Data on a CD-ROM can be searched, retrieved and manipulatedby a desktop computer.andP;  For many kinds of information, CD-ROM can providefaster and more flexible user access than print, timesharing or microfilm.andM;* Versatility.andP;  CD-ROM discs (and enhanced versions of the CD-ROM format)still seem to be the obvious basis for interactive multimedia products.andO;Compact discs can hold digitized information of all kinds: not justalphanumeric data and stereo audio, but also still-frame photos, documentimages, computer software, graphics and even full-frame/full-motion video.andO;Digital multimedia, sooner or later, will probably have wide application ineducation, entertainment, marketing and technical documentation.andP;  The onlyrandom access multimedia technology competing with compact discs right nowwould seem to be CD-ROM's grandparent, the laser videodisc, an analog format.andM;The installed base.andP;  The CD-ROM industry has overcome the so-called chickenand egg problem.andP;  Libraries, schools, government agencies and corporationsaround the world have bought more than one million CD-ROM readers, double theinstalled based on just a year ago, according to the Optical PublishingAssociation's industry assessment for 1990, released at CD-ROM Expo.andP;  Thatreport estimates that there will be six million readers installed worldwideby the end of 1991.andM;The CD-ROM drive is not yet a household item in the literal sense, however.andO;According to Barry Cinnamon, president of a company called the Bureau ofElectronic Publishing, only approximately 30,000 CD players are in use inAmerican homes.andM;CD-ROM applicationsandM;There were 1,418 CD-ROM titles available at the end of 1989, according to theOPA assessment; OPA forecasts about 3,000 by the end of 1990 and close to6,000 by the end of 1991.andP;  Among the first group are both commercial titlesand in-house publications.andM;The library niche.andP;  Some of the most active commercial publishing of CD-ROMapplications has occurred in the library market: bibliographical data such asabstracts, indexes and card catalog databases.andP;  In libraries, onlinedatabases and machine-readable catalogs had already become familiar tools.andO;The adoption of a desktop computer/CD-ROM format was therefore a logicaladditional step, encouraged by both convenience and cost savings.andM;In a few short years, several key information publishers have put much of thebibliographic universe on CD-ROM.andP;  These companies and services include UMI(University Microfilms), Bowker Electronic Publishing, H.W.andP;  Wilson,Information Access (InfoTrac), SilverPlatter, Compact Cambridge and Dialog.andM;For example, you can find Bowker's Books in Print on CD-ROM, complete with100,000 current full-text book reviews.andP;  But also available from the sourceslisted above are a wide range of abstracts and indexes for popular andbusiness periodicals; doctoral dissertations; professional, technical andscientific journals; yearbooks; and newspapers.andP;  There are indexes tonon-print products, too: videotapes, films, music albums and computersoftware.andM;In a trend confirmed at the recent CD-ROM Expo, we are now seeing wholemagazines, journals and newspapers preserved on CD-ROM, not just theabstracts and indexes of these publications.andM;Some vendors have stored these completed publications in ASCII text form,mated with retrieval software that permits full-text searching.andP;  For example,Zipp Communications' Computer Library Computer Periodicals Database storesthe editorial content of many publications (including this Report) infull-text character format.andP;  Also of general interest will be the ConsumerReports full-text disc from NISC.andM;Another approach to storing whole publications on CD is to scan them asdigitized raster images.andP;  Pages images can be displayed on a PC screen orprinted with a laser printer.andP;  This approach has the advantage of capturingthe complete content and format: the ads, pictures and typography, as well aseditorial text.andM;UMI distributes CD-ROM-based full-page images of 300 of the 800 businessperiodicals that it abstracts on disc.andP;  Disclosure publishes LaserD, anotherpage image product, which reproduces corporate public disclosure filings.andM;Libraries have found users willing to pay a per-page fee for the convenienceof printing out abstracts or bibliographies, article text files and pageimages.andM;In the future, vanilla ASCII full-text versions of periodicals archived onCD-ROM may be succeeded by SGML files, and the &quot;digital microfilm&quot; page imageapproach may be replaced by page description languages or digital compounddocument descriptions also used in publishing the original print versions.andM;&quot;Shovelware.&quot;andP;  Some developers have taken what appears to be public domainmaterial and &quot;shoveled&quot; enormous quantities of it onto CD-ROM--collections ofPC and Macintosh software as well as large collections of printed works.andM;As a result, there is no shortage of discs containing the Bible, Shakespeareand Sherlock Holmes.andP;  Included in that group is a new disc from WorldLibrary, the Library of the Future Series First Edition.andP;  It holds thecomplete text of 450 great books--classic works by Aeschylus, Aristophanes,Aristotle, St. Augustine, Francis Bacon, Boccaccio, Cervantes, Chaucer .andP;  . andO;.  you get the idea.andP;  Advertised price: $695.andM;The Bureau of Electronic Publishing is now shipping U.S.andP;  History on CD-ROM,containing one hundred books and 1,000 images.andP;  This company shared plans fortwo similar products, World History on CD-ROM and Countries of the World,each with the text of over 100 books, plus pictures.andM;Reference works.andP;  Reference discs for library and desktop use continue toproliferate.andP;  They show the advantages of a digital medium very nicely, withelectronic searches and hyperlinks as well as audible bells and whistles.andM;In the encyclopedia realm, the new CD-ROM version of Grolier's AcademicAmerican Encyclopedia, the Electronic Encyclopedia, now has pictures.andM;Compton's MultiMedia Encyclopedia from Britannica Software continues todazzle as an example of the multimedia future.andP;  For $895, schools and parentsof children in the primary grades can buy 9,000,000 words; 15,000 images,maps and graphs; 60 minutes of sound, music and speech; 45 animatedsequences; plus a complete online Merriam-Webster Intermediate dictionary.andM;Wrold Book also has a CD-ROM version of its encyclopedia, Information Finder,but we did not see it exhibited in Boston.andM;The Xiphias Time Table of History series, which began with the Time Table ofScience and Innovation, will be followed by the Time Table of Business,Politics and Media.andP;  These Xiphias products were specifically developed forCD-ROM.andM;Multimedia components are also present on CD Music Guide, a guide to music onaudio compact discs.andP;  This CD-ROM includes more than 40,000 audio titles,plus some reviews, quality ratings, color graphics (album covers) and anumber of CD-quality audio tracks demonstrating new album releases.andM;Birds of America, from CMC Research, presents both pictures and bird calls.andM;Mammals: A Multimedia Encyclopedia was developed by the National GeographicSociety and IBM.andP;  It contains text, color photos, range maps, animalvocalizations, and 45 motion video clips, using standard CD-ROM format.andM;The Physician's Desk Reference on CD-ROM contains five PDR volumes.andP;  TheMerck Manual is an optional add-on.andM;You know about the Oxford English Dictionary on CD.andP;  Another ambitious discis the 12-language dictionary Languages of the World, which can define wordsacoss any pair of languages on the disc.andM;The CD-ROM has also brought forth an electronic cookbook.andM;Legal and goverment information.andP;  West Publishing is putting some parts ofthe WestLaw database on CD-ROM, with a &quot;seamless link&quot; to the online files.andO;The CD-ROM version adds hypertext links.andP;  For example, you can jump from afootnote to the citation itself.andP;  A &quot;book&quot; mode supplements the Boolean querymode, and information may be downloaded from the CD to a &quot;notebook&quot; file onthe hard drive as searches proceed.andM;The U.S.andP;  Patent and Trademark Office is replacing its online patent searchsystem with CD-ROMs.andP;  At this point, the CDs contain abstract and index data,not the patent files themselves.andM;International Thompson publishes Official Gazette/Plus, which has both patentabstracts and images of recent patents.andM;The forthcoming weekly CDFR disc is a CD-ROM version of the Federal Register,derived from the magnetic tapes used to typeset the print publication.andP;  Userswill be able to search by page number or by range of dates or issues.andP;  Theycan also find sections containing specific terms through a full-text search.andO;Each disc will contain the last six months of Federal Register text.andO;(Subscription: $1,500 from Counterpoint Systems.)andM;The U.S.andP;  government is one of the largest developers of CD-ROM applications.andO;SIGCAT, the Special Interest Group on CD-ROM, is an invaluable source ofinformation on federal CD-ROM projects, standards, etc.andM;Directories and mailing lists.andP;  CD-ROM is coming on strong in directory andmailing list distribution.andM;PhoneDisc USA, from Compact Publications, is a residential phone directoryfor the whole country, on two discs, for $1,895 per subscriptions.andP;  Now beingshipped, this could be the new application with the widest horizontal appealat the show.andP;  The two discs, East and West, contain a total of more than 90million residential listings, with name, address and phone number (whereavailable).andM;These discs are not to be copied in machine readable form, nor to be resold.andO;Now, however, you can find your long-lost relatives, college classmates,whatever.andP;  You can print up to twenty listings at a time for futurereference.andP;  An autodial feature allows you to dial from the application.andO;Searches can be done on partial names and can be constrained by combinationsof area code, ZIP code, state, city or street.andM;PhoneDisc USA will probably be used heavily by law enforcement officers,collection agencies, credit departments and genealogists.andP;  Libraries, it isclaimed, can eliminate 5,000 printed directories from their shelves bypurchasing these two discs.andM;James Bryant, president of Compact Publications, explained some of thehistory of PhoneDisc.andP;  The data was acquired the hard way, without access tothe phone companies' tapes.andP;  A German company, iBS Hannover, provided CompactPublications with the OCR technology to scan phone numbers, apparently fromall of the phone books in the U.S.!andP;  These listings were compared and mergedwith address information purchased from other lists to avoid copyrightinfringement.andM;The iBS OCR system, Gigaread, was also demonstrated in the CompactPublications booth.andP;  It scanned the small print in the five-column-per-pageManhattan phone directory with apparent success.andP;  We were told that the iBSproduct operates at 800 characters per second and will soon be introduced inthe U.S.andM;Bryant had been the head of the division of SilverPlatter that announced asimilar national directory, called DiscAmerica, a year ago.andP;  When legalproblems arose, concerning ownership of that database, the project wascanceled.andP;  Bryant then bought that division, which became CompactPublications, and went about building the national white pages from newsources.andP;  In turn, Compact Publications was recently acquired by iBS.andM;SilverPlatter, meanwhile, says that it will soon ship DiscAmerica, which willbe introduced for $5,000.andM;The American Business Disk from American Business Information (Omaha, NE)purports to be a national yellow pages directory.andP;  The America Business Diskcontains listings of mor than 9.2 million businesses.andP;  Searches can beconstrained by yellow page classification headings or business type codes.andO;You can search by company name or by geographic area, as well.andP;  A 12-monthlicense is $1,495.andM;After the Boston show, we received a description of a very similar-soundingclassified business directory disc, SpeedDial from Dataware Technologies,priced at $99 in a single-user version.andM;Lotus MarketPlace (for the Mac) offers data on 80 million household listingsand 7.5 million businesses, with software for market analysis and creatingmailing lists.andP;  It is priced as a mailing list source, not as a referencework.andM;MicroFinalist from LPC (a Pitney Bowes company) is a mailing system that usesa CD-ROM containing the U.S.andP;  Postal Service directory.andP;  This directoryconsists of 370 megabytes of data used to standardize mailing lists, appendand verify ZIP and ZIP+4 codes, and plan carrier routes, based on streetnumbers.andP;  Other mailing list software suppliers also use CD-ROMs with theUSPS data to construct and correct lists.andM;There are numerous CD directories on more specialized topics.andP;  Bound to be abig seller, no doubt, is a comprehensive listing of Belgian notaries.andM;Commercial databases on CD-ROM.andP;  TRW Business Credit introduced the TRWCredit Decision Disk, which provides business profiles and credit summarieson three million businesses.andM;Datapro Software Finder uses the Dataware authoring system to provideinformation on 18,000 software packages.andM;DataWorld InfoDisk from Faulkner Technical Reports has product reviews,graphic images and full-text reports on thousands of computer andcommunication products.andM;Lotus has been distributing financial data for its One Source service onCD-ROM.andM;Software and documentation.andP;  Computer and software companies are puttingtechnical documentation on CD-ROM, both for their customers and for in-housedistribution to tech-support people.andP;  Apple and Microsoft led the way withprogrammers' utilities and documentation on CD-ROM, but they are being joinedby others.andM;Intel, for example, is implementing a documentation output system developedby R.R.andP;  Donnelley and Sons, using Dataware search and retrieval software, toprint product documentation as needed at sales offices.andM;Unisys will use Personal Library Software's Personal Librarian full-textsoftware to publish documentation for two of its mainframe series.andM;IBM is using CD-ROM and KnowledgeSet's KRS software for the technicaldocumentation for its RS/6000 family.andM;Hewlett-Packard is shipping documentation for the HP 3000 on CD-ROM.andM;Lotus Prompt is a CD-ROM library of technical support information andsoftware demonstrations.andM;Art, graphics, maps.andP;  CD-ROMs now store nautical charts, maps and pictures ofartworks.andP;  The National Portrait Gallery disc contains 4,000 images from theGallery.andP;  Artfact is a CD-ROM database, updated quarterly, of descriptionsand prices of artworks sold at the top auction galleries.andP;  The descriptionsand color pictures are taken from the galleries' catalogs.andM;Resource files for print and multimedia publishers.andP;  There are several clipart and font library discs.andP;  A multimedia clip art disc, Mediasource fromApplied Optical Media Corp. (Malvern, PA), provides 1,500 natural images,more than an hour of music and more than 20 minutes of sound effects.andP;  Theprice is $395 and there are no royalties for use by the purchaser.andO;Mediasource requires an IBM PS/2 with the AVC (Audio Visual Connection).andM;CD-ROM catalogsandM;To get an idea of the full breath and depth of the current array of CD-ROMtitles, consider the following printed lists and catalogs.andP;  (Company addressnot in the Seybold Vendor Directory are on page 23.)andM;AppleCD SC Third Party Products, a list from Apple Computer, July 1990.andO;(Mac)andM;Bureau of Electronic Publishing Product Guide is $4.95.andP;  (Mac and PC)andM;CD-ROM, Inc. has separate catalogs for IBM-compatible and Mac products.andM;CD-ROM Shoppers Guide (Helgerson Associates) $12.95/year; single issue $3.95(Apple II, PC, Mac, Atar, Vax)andM;CD-ROM in Print (Meckler Publishing).andP;  $49.50, paper, published annualy inOctober.andM;CD-ROMS about CD-ROMs.andP;  A number of publishers are using CD-ROM as the mediumto catalog and illustrate the universe of CD-ROM applications.andM;The CD-ROM Sourcedisc is being prepared by Helgerson Associates.andP;  It willcontain descriptions and demonstrations of commercially available CD-ROMtitles.andP;  The price will be $89.95.andM;Selectware Technologies produces a remarkable quarterly CD-ROM with Pcsoftware demo presentations and multimedia CD-ROM demonstrations.andP;  A mac discis in the works.andP;  Euro-CD's The Disc of the Discs, in Mac and PC versions, isintended for use by computer stores and libraries wanting to demonstrateCD-ROM discs, but it can be purchased for $99.andP;  Each title described on thedisc is illustrated with a six- to eight-minute demo, including an audionarration accompanying 20 or more screens.andM;The Disc of the Disc is produced in French, English, German and Italianversions and is updated every two months.andP;  It not only demonstraes some ofthe most interesting CD-ROM products, but is itself a good demonstration of amixed-mode audio and visual CD-ROM.andM;DISC Magazine, a new monthly from Helgerson Associates, will be accompaniedby a CD-ROM containing supplementary information about technical issues inoptical publishing.andP;  This CD will be called &quot;disc/DISC.&quot;andM;Corporate applications.andP;  Kurt Mueller, president of Dataware, believes thatcorporations will increasingly adopt CD-ROM for in-house informationdistribution, replacing or supplementing source document microfiche, computeroutput microfilm, online databases and paper.andP;  Up to now, Mueller noted,Publishers and government agencies have been the largest CD-ROM titlesources.andM;Delivery systemsandM;Advances to CD-ROM delivery systems announced in Boston were incremental andevolutionary.andP;  They include faster drives, greater portability,cross-platform and LAN compatibility, lower prices, and the anticipation ofmor bundling of CD-ROM hardware and applications with home and businessdesktop systems.andM;Speed demons.andP;  With hard disks having double- or even single-digitmillisecond (ms) access times, it seems odd to brag about breaking the 350-msbarrier, but that's what the CD-ROM vendors do.andM;Hitachi claimed the world's fastest access time: less than 340 ms (&quot;randomaccess&quot; for its new CDR-1700S for XT/AT and PS/2 computers.andM;Laser Magnetic Storage (LMSI), now completely owned by Philips, announced twoproducts: model CM202, a half-height serial-interface CD-ROM with less than350-ms average access time, and the model CM214 CD-ROM, the same as the CM202but with a SCSI interface.andM;The NEC Interest CDR-72 (external) and CDR-82 (internal) CD-ROM drives nowhave a 350-ms typical access time.andP;  These SCSI drives be used with Mac, PC orNEC ProSpeed LTX host interfaces.andM;Lower prices.andP;  As an example of the price trend, there were older, slowerHitachi 3500 external drive kits (with host adapter and MS-DOS CD-ROMextensions) advertised for as low as $450, quantity one, by Laser ResourcesInc.andM;Portable drives and systems.andP;  The LMSI CM 50 portable CD-ROM drive weighsless than two pounds.andP;  It derives power from the host through the interfacecable, eliminating the need for a battery pack or separate power supply.andM;The CD Porta-Drive from CD Tecnology, Inc. uses an external power supply andan optional battery pack.andP;  A parallel port kit adapts it to a PC with no openslots.andM;The Texel portable CD-ROM drive can also interface with a parallel port,using the Trantor parallel-to-SCSI adapter.andM;A battery-operated laptop computer with CD-ROM was demonstrated: the Infomanfrom Lotos Computer (Berlin, Germany).andP;  Sold in the U.S.andP;  by Accu-MemSystems, it consists of an NEC CDR-35 CD-ROM drive, a hard disk and a PogetPC.andM;The Goupil Golf from France is a '386-based portable with a backlit VGAdisplay and an internal CD-ROM drive.andM;Scenario has a touch-screen CD-ROM portable now called the Dyna Visionsystem.andP;  Applications must be designed around its touch screen input.andM;The Sony Data Discman, introduced earlier in Japan, was rumored to be at theSony booth, but we didn't see it.andP;  This CD-ROM &quot;Walkman&quot; has an LCD screenfor text-only display and uses CD-single (CD-3-size) ROM disc, but apparentlyit hasn't learned the Latin alphabet yet.andM;PCs with CDs.andP;  Plans are reputed to be in the works to bundle CD-ROM drivesand/or applications in additional PC configurations.andP;  HeadStart, Tandy andMagnavox have been the pioneers in promoting such packages.andP;  Packard Bell,emerson, Apple and IBM were also mentioned as possibly following this path.andM;Cross-platform compatibility.andP;  Logicraft's CD-Ware allows DEC or Sunworkstations access to PC-compatible CD-ROM packages.andM;A number of replication houses were offering to master discs with data in twoformats (ISO 9660 and Apple HFS) on the same CD-ROM.andM;LAN compatibility and multiplatter units.andP;  Online's Opti-NET VAP allows usersto connect CD-ROM drives directly to a Novell file server.andM;CBIS CD Connection software allows users to access multiple CD-ROM drivessimultaneously over a hard LAN.andP;  Each drive appears as a logical drive on thenetwork (Novell and others).andP;  Used with a CBIS CD Server, this can offeraccess to up to 21 CD-ROM drives.andM;SilverPlatter sells a MultiPlatter tower containing seven to twenty-fourdrives.andM;The Pioneer DRM-600 and DRM-610 CD-ROM changers can be configured as sixlogical devices or as a single device with up to six discs as one datasource.andP;  Up to seven six-disc changers can be daisy-chained.andM;Meridian Data is now marketing Artisoft's Lantastic network operating systemwith its own CD-ROM networking system called CD-Net.andP;  This is targeted atCD-ROM users who want to install a LAN but have not yet done so.andM;Development and retrieval toolsandM;A significant focus of the CD-ROM Expo is on development tools for CD-ROMapplications.andP;  These include data preparation packages for organizing andindexing the data; premastering systems for formatting the data in compliancewith a disc file system standard (often ISO 9660); in-house write-once CD-ROMsystems for prototypes and low-volume production; and retrieval software, thesearch program and user interface included on the published disc.andM;There were several major developments in these publishing tools.andM;Windows 3.0-based tools.andP;  CD-ROM software compatible with Windows 3.0 isemerging as a force.andM;* Crowninshield Software is shipping MediaBase Windows as one of the severalretrieval interfaces available with its Publishing Package.andM;* KnowledgeSet demonstrated a Windows 3.0 version of its Graphic KnowledgeRetrieval System for text and graphics databases, to be available in thefirst quarter of 1991.andP;  This package will include hypertext, full-textsearch, multiple font display and CGM graphics support.andP;  Graphic KRS canaccess both raster and vector images.andM;Using CGM and CCITT Group II and IV graphic file support, developers canutilize standard file formats that work across multiple platforms.andP;  GraphicsKRS will display multiple typefaces and point sizes in the database text.andM;* Meridian Data is shipping Windows CD, a Windows 3.0 version of itspremastering and CD-simulation software.andP;  Windows CD is a streamlineversionof VR Publisher 5.0.andP;  The premastered data, in High Sierra or ISO 9660format, is ouput to a tape medium: DAT,8mm Exabyte, 9-track or 3480.andM;Write-once CD-ROM publishing systems.andP;  Writable CDs are now beginning to beused for the production of prototypes, demo discs or small production runs,or for distributing secure data.andP;  This is &quot;desktop CD-ROM publishing&quot;; it canall be done in-house.andM;Write-once CD publishing systems use Sony or Yamaha CD recorders to transferdata CD-size write-once discs.andP;  These discs are readable on standard CD-ROMdrives, just as if they had been stamped at a pressing plant; however, sincethe formatting is not quite as precise, not as much data can be placed on awritable CD as on one stamped from a master.andP;  The write-once medium costs $50or less per disc.andP;  (Kodak will use write-once CDs in its Photo CD productannounced in September and promised to be available in two years.andP;  It expectsthat photo labs will charge $20 to digitize the contents of a roll of filmand write it onto a CD.)andM;Companies showing their latest write-once CD in-house production systeminclude:andM;* Meridian (Apple HFS and ISO 9660 CD-ROMs and CD-audio).andM;* Optical Media International (Apple and ISO);andM;* Sony (ISO, CD-ROM/XA, CD-I), whose system runs on Sony Unix Workstations;andandM;* Interactive Support Group (Chatsworth, CA).andP;  The Mac-PDS uses a Mac tocreate CD-audio, CD-I, CD-ROM and CD-ROM/XA writable discs.andM;Publishing tools spread across platforms, networks.andP;  Dataware Technologieswill provide the CD Author authoring system to run under Unix on Sun Sparcworkstations and under VMS on DEC Vax systems in the first quarter of 1991.andO;The Sun or Vax will speed up the indexing process after the application isdeveloped on a slower machine.andM;KnowledgeSet retrieval products are already available for DOS, Macintosh andUnix platforms.andP;  An application program interface, KRSAPI, also allows thesame CD-ROM to be used across DOS, Mac and Unix platforms.andM;Meridian's latest Macintosh-based CD-ROM premastering and simulationsoftware, Macintosh VR Publisher 4.0, is now being shipped using the standardMacintosh GUI.andP;  It can be used to create ISO 9660 or Apple HFS tapes forsubmission to replication facilities or to produce write-once CDs, withSony's CDW E1 and CDW W1 CD recorder, in conjunction with Meridian's new VRSProfessional system.andM;Opti-ware from Online Computer Systems will be available for OS/2 and XWindow environments, featuring text and image retrieval.andM;Data prep tools.andP;  From Britannica Software/Del Mar Technologies comesSmartrieve, search and retrieval software that uses expert system techniquesto respond to all queries, whether incomplete and inaccurate or precise.andM;DiscPassage text indexing and image retrieval software from CMC Research, aleader in medical CD-ROM applications, is now available for PC and Macplatforms via source code or object code license.andM;Questar is now available from Publishers Data Service Corp., a Sony USAcompany.andP;  It can index and retrieve structured data.andM;More data types.andP;  The incorporation of a wider range of data types intoCD-ROM development tools continues.andP;  Reference Set, from Reference Technology(Boulder, CO), includes the following modules:andM;* Reference Bench data preparation software;andM;* Key Record Build, which indexes structured data;andM;* image Build, which captures and indexes images;andM;* OCR Toolkit;andM;* Intelligent Markup Toolkit, which adds SGML tags to indicate new documents,headers, paragrahs, figures and tables.andP;  Intelligent Markup supports&quot;automatic&quot; tagging;andM;* Full Text Build, which indexes the text, preserving the SGML information,develops a table of contents, etc.andM;* CD-Simulator, which simulates, debugs and optimizes the application andpremasters it; andandM;* Reference Book, retrieval software shipped with the application disc.andM;InnerView is marketed by TMS for very large full-text files that may containassociated images.andM;Re:Search is a full text and image retrieval package from RetrievalTechnologies (Cambridge, MA).andM;SearchExpress handles text files and images now with &quot;enhanced line levelhypertext.&quot;andM;Software Mart's MediaMixer is a set of subroutine libraries for CD-ROM dicsthat include fielded data, computer software, full text or images.andM;Terralogics offers TerraView, a data preparation package that specializes inspatial indexing capabilities for CD-ROM.andP;  TerraView integrates map data andcan simultaneously overlay, display and operate upon user data, census TIGER,ETAK, USGS-DLG, GBF, Rand McNally and other specialized map data formats.andM;Knowledge Access currently offers an aggressively priced set of packages thatcan add images to either fielded data or text data, the KAware DiskPublisher.andP;  The text versions sells for $795; the fielded data version, $795;and the image upgrade for either lists for $99.andP;  The KAware2 Retrieval Systemincluded on each disc copy is $99 per disc replica in small quantities.andM;User interfaces: mix and match.andP;  The computer's power to perform Booleansearches for content or to jump about via hyperlinks has confused anddisoriented users.andP;  To remedy this, CD-ROM retrieval shells are evolving fromonline database query languages to more simplified, screen-oriented andgraphical formats.andM;Even with these improvements, however, the lack of a consistent userinterface remains a sore point.andP;  Each set of authoring tools usually preparesapplications that use a particular proprietary retrieval shell.andP;  The typicalCD-ROM user does not want to spend time learning to do simple searches withina variety of different retrieval shells.andM;There are three general approaches to solving this problem: separating theuser front end from the search engine, and ultimately standardizingcommunication between the two; standardizing user commands; and standardizingdata structures and indexing schemes.andP;  The last alternative is not likely tobe adopted soon.andM;If the user shell and retrieval engine are split into client and server, theretrieval engine can be paired with a user shell preferred by a given user.andO;Some variations on this approach were evident in Boston.andM;Along with its MediaBase tools, for example, Crowninshield now includes itsnew MediaBase Windows user interface, as well as MediaBase Light a DOS-basedinterface for novice users, and MediaBase Runtime, a DOS-based interfacedesigned for more advanced needs.andM;A CD-ROM Developer's Package includes the Publisher's package plus theMediaBase Function Library for customizing applications and retrieval shells.andM;Nimbus Information Systems is now shipping two user interfaces for Romware,its data preparation and retrieval software.andP;  The new &quot;standard&quot; Romware userinterface is easier to use than the advanced version and works well with amouse.andP;  Publishers can put both Romware user interfaces on their discs andlet the end users select which one they want.andM;Nimbus is also shipping Romware/DBServ, which permits developers to createuser interfaces (custom front ends) in any language for the Romware engine.andO;Romware DBServe permits full text, structured text, fielded data, graphicsand sound to coexist in the same application.andP;  The developer can createmultiple interfaces targeted at specific vertical markets.andM;KnowledgeSet's KRSAPI enables developers to link custom applications andinterfaces to the KRS search engine.andM;Beyond these attempts to separate the front end and back end of the retrievalsoftware, if the user interface could communicate with the database serverusing a standardized set of queries, and receive responses in a standardprotocol, user interfaces and index/retrieval software could be mixed andmatched.andP;  A user could then apply a favorite or familiar retrieval shell toany disc.andM;One such client/server standards effort is CD-RDX (Compact Disc Read OnlyData Exchange), proposed by various U.S.andP;  intelligence agencies.andP;  Anotherattempt is SFQL, developed by the Air Transport Association to make airlinemaintenance manuals on CD independent of a particular user shell.andP;  SFQL is anextension of the SQL database query language into a Structured Full-TextQuery Language.andP;  CD-RDX and SFQL represent ongoing efforts towardstandardization.andM;There is also work in progress to standardize major elements of the userinterface: command names, function keys and icons, for example.andP;  This effort,also in the preliminary stages, is being pushed by the CD-ROM ConsistentInterface Committee of SIGCAT and in the UK by CD-SPAD.andM;Multimedia toolsandM;Authorware showed its Authorware Professional for Windows 3.0.andP;  Thismultimedia development tool is intended to be a twin of the originalobject-oriented Macintosh version, used to create interactive displays andtraining materials.andP;  Authorware Professional graphics, animations, andsounds, logic maps and variables created on the Mac may be converted andimported into the Windows version.andP;  Authors build a graphic &quot;logic map&quot; ofthe application by assembling icons into sequences and loops.andP;  This processdoes for multimedia instructional design procedures such as storyboarding andflowcharting what outliner programs do for writing.andP;  The icons appear to callor cue the relevant routines to display a particular animation or graphic,play a particular audio segment and so forth.andM;CBIS is designing multimedia development tools that will add sound andanimation to business presentations and computer-based training, delivered ina network environment.andP;  Knowledge Server is a database server providing LANaccess to multimedia application delivery stations, which are LAN stationswith VGA, audio decoders, headphones or speakers and special input devices.andM;A windowed full-motion video capability is also in the works.andP;  The KnowledgeProducer authorizing system will enable development of courses andpresentations.andP;  A LAN will enable interaction between trainees at differentworkstations to simulate team interactions.andP;  CBIS supports graphic outliningof courses to design and test the courseware.andM;CBIS is also developing a Knowledge Kiosk, using CD-ROM for point-of-saledisplays and the like.andM;Disk formatsandM;One of the biggest problems with CD-ROMs remains the proliferation of diskformats.andP;  At the moment, there are two principal format standards used in thepersonal computer industry, plus at least four additional formats that haveimportant backing.andM;ISO 9660.andP;  The base standard for the PC industry is the so-called High Sierraformat developed in 1986 and adopted as an official international standard(ISO 9660) in 1988.andP;  Apple Computer remains the most important holdout,preferring its own HFS CD-ROM format--an important exception since many ofthe most interesting interactive CD-ROM titles have been produced for theMacintosh.andM;Both High Sierra and the Apple formats will support text, still images andsound.andP;  The ISO 9660 standard specifies several levels of sound quality,ranging from telephone voice grade to high-fidelity CD-audio.andP;  Naturally, thehigher the sound quality, the more data required.andM;Mixed-mode CD-ROM discs can contain conventional high-fidelity stereoCD-audio information as well as conventional CD-ROM data.andP;  These applicationscan play music or a narration to accompany a photograph display on thescreen, or they can append a bird song or a recorded voice to an electronicencyclopedia entry.andM;Newer CD-ROM players can read mixed-mode discs as well as single-mode CD-ROMdata discs and audio CDs.andP;  Audio can be tapped via a stereo headphone jack inthe front of the CD-ROM drive and sometimes through RCA jacks in the back.andO;Note that in mixed-mode CD-ROM, the audio is processed by the drive'selectronics, as it would be in a CD-audio player; it doesn't have to berouted through the PC's processor.andM;As we have seen, a growing number of CD-ROM applications contains still-framephotographs, chats, maps and other color or black-and-white screen images.andO;With audio accompanying the still-frame screen images, the presentation canresemble a classic slide/tape production.andP;  The CD-ROM presentation, however,has the advantages of responding to user input--i.e., of beinginteractive--and of having CD-quality sound.andM;A picture and sound interactive training CD-ROM sample is the HazardAwareness Health and Safety Library produced by Meta Media Systems anddistributed by Online Products Corp.andP;  The message is augmented by audio,color graphics and images.andP;  The first disc, Hazard Communication, colorfullyimparts OSHA-required information about a less-than-enertaining topic:workplace hazards.andM;There is a limitation on audio/visual coordination on CD-ROM, however: CD-ROMdrives with standard drivers and interfaces cannot actually read audio andscreen image data at the same time, as a VCR can.andP;  Reading sequentially,however, the application can paint the screen and then play the audio.andP;  Theaudio information usually comes from a separate region of the disc, maybe ahalf-second away.andM;Beyond 9660.andP;  This is an interesting start, but it is not what you would liketo have for a truly interactive multimedia application.andP;  A number ofcompanies--and combinations of companies--have developed formats that pushbeyond the limitations of the original CD-ROM formats.andM;For the past several years, the two principal contenders for&quot;next-generation&quot; CD-ROM format have been the DVI (Digital Video Interactive)technology supported by Intel, IBM and Microsoft, and CD-I (CD-Interactive),promoted by Philips and (initially at least) Sony.andP;  More recent contendersinclude Sony's CD-ROM/XA format and Commodore's CDTV.andM;DVI.andP;  The Digital Video Interactive technology was developed by RCA and takenover by Intel.andP;  Because it has been supported by both IBM and Microsoft, ithas been seen as the computer industry's preferred format for next-generationCD-ROMs.andM;The principal objective of DVI is, as the name would imply, to cramfull-motion video onto a medium designed to hold 74 minutes of hi-fi audio.andO;The problems are the limited amount of data storage on a CD and therelatively slow data transfer rate from the disc.andM;It is clear that the only realistic way to get any amount of full-frame,30-frame-per-second motion video onto a standard compact disc is to compressthe video data before writing it onto the disc, then decompress it afterreading it.andM;Since CDs are a read-only medium stamped out in factories, the DVI developersdecided on an asymmetric approach to compression and decompression.andO;Compression is done one time at a central production facility using lots ofcomputer power.andP;  Decompression is done on the fly by chips built into the PCthat reads the disc.andP;  (Intel also offers a &quot;symmetric&quot; compression mode inwhich both compression and decompression are performed by software running onthe 1750 chip.andP;  This yields substantially lower-quality video.)andM;For playback, DVI requires hardware using the Intel 1750 chip set; the CD-ROMdrive itself used to read CD-DVI discs is a garden variety one.andP;  Intel andIBM are shipping the ActionMedia DVI delivery board (at and MCA bus) for$2,495 with two megabytes of RAM.andP;  Developers also need the DVI video/audiocapture board, development software, etc.andP;  Intel tells us to expect DVI chipsintegrated on a Pc motherboard in DVI delivery systems in the not-too-distantfuture.andM;The DVI publishing video mode, production level video (PLV), requiresprocessing by a service bureau (compression center) to achieve 160:1compression, 72 minutes of full-screen full-motion video with FM qualitystereo audio, or four hours of quarter-screen video, etc.andP;  Intel claims &quot;VCRquality&quot; for its PLV format now, but says it will achieve &quot;near HDTV&quot; by 1992with new chips.andM;Up to 44 hours of &quot;near AM quality&quot; mono audio can be put on CD-ROM with DVIcompression, as can 42,000 medium-resolution still images or 650,000 pages oftext.andM;We have learned over the years to be somewhat cautious about Intel's claims.andO;Every time we have seen a demonstration, the images have been worse than wewere told they were going to be.andP;  Moreover, the whole premise that off-linecompression is required to get sufficient levels of data compression is nowbeing called into question by the work on the JPEG still image compressionstandard and its cousin, the MPEG standard for motion images.andP;  Earlier thisyear, Intel began to backpedal somewhat by stressing that its chip set can beused for other compression routines--including MPEG when that becomesavailable.andM;DVI products.andP;  Because DVI needs a special playback board (at this point) tobe decoded, it now is mostly a tool for developing and delivering specializedinteractive training programs, interactive sales materials, etc.andP;  The typicalinitial applications resemble interactive presentations that were done inearlier years with interactive laser videodiscs.andM;Intel sees DVI applications appearing in training, point of sale, educationand entertainment applications, as well as in &quot;desktop&quot; applications such asvideo mail, business presentations and product information.andM;DVI's presence was felt at the Expo in several products.andM;Cornucopia by Empruve is a &quot;personal information delivery appliance&quot; usingthe DVI chip set for motion video.andP;  The desktop console uses two separateflat screens: one for video, the other for text and other data.andP;  A CD-ROMdrive is built into the unit, along with a '386 computer.andP;  The full-page textand graphics screens can be gas plasma, LCD or electroluminescent.andP;  Thefour-inch color motion video monitor is based on active matrix technology.andO;Cornucopia's separate icon/function key panel and the joystick-like TadPolehave been tied to &quot;navigational&quot; software called Pathfinder.andM;Still in prototype stage, Empruve's Cornucopia may be showing us elements ofthe 21st-century all-purpose desktop workstation.andP;  Empruve is offering aDeveloper's Center for the creation and simulation of DVI presentations forits unique Cornucopia platform.andM;Network Technology Corp. announced the release of version 1.5 of Mediascript,its multimedia application design tools for DVI.andP;  Mediascript tools andapplications use ATandamp;T's Open Look GUI.andM;Using Mediascript and DVI, Intelex TouchGuide CD-ROM kiosks now provideroadside information (and advertising) to Florida tourists.andM;Authology from CEIT Systems is another DVI author tool.andM;EnSuite from Humanagement in Toronto is a DVI-based desktop video editor forthe PC.andP;  It will permit storyboarding and frame-accurate editing offull-motion digital video.andM;IBM showed the multiplicity of its multimedia offerings: Action Media 750(DVI); AVC (Audio Visual Connection); and M-Motion (videodisc-based approachderived from IBM's InfoWindow training system).andP;  The long-term &quot;strategic&quot;direction is supposed to be DVI.andM;CD-I.andP;  While DVI is a product of the computer industry, the rival CD-I formatwas intended from the start as a technology for the consumer market.andP;  CD-Icame from an effort by Philips and Sony (joint developers of the originalCD-audio) to extend CDs into interactive multimedia.andM;The design objective was to come up with an interactive CD-I player that willsell for less than $1,000 and will hook up to the home TV set rather than tocomputer.andP;  To meet this objective, CD-I did not attempt to support fullframe, full motion video.andM;This has been a problem--but one that Philips believes it will be able torectify.andP;  Philips now says that it will have CD-I with symmetric (on-the-fly)compression and decompression of full-frame 30-frame-per-second motion videoready by September, 1991.andP;  It experts that its approach will be compatiblewith the upcoming MPEG standard.andM;In the meantime, Philips has formed AIM (American Interactive Media) to funddevelopment of, and to market, CD-I titles.andP;  It claims that it will have anumber of titles available by the time payers hit the consumer market.andO;However, there is still very little CD-I work being done outside of AIM,partly because the CD-I authoring tools are generally considered to be weak.andM;CD-ROM/XA.andP;  Sony, while not officially abandoning CD-I, has recently put mostof its muscle behind its CD-ROM/XA format as an international multivendorstandard.andP;  Several other important Japanese manufacturers have also committedto using the XA format.andM;CD-ROM/XA is a step up from ordinary CD-ROM toward multimedia, but it lackscompressed full-motion video.andP;  The XA format interleaves audio, graphics andother data.andP;  The audio is &quot;streamed&quot; directly off the disk so that audioinformation and screen data can be read with virtual simultaneity from thedisc.andM;CD-ROM/XA compresses audio, using ADPCM (Adaptive Differential Pulse CodeModulation).andP;  This compression results in some sacrifice in quality comparedto standard PCM CD-audio, but it squeezes as much as 16 hours of mono soundonto a disc in its lowest (AM radio) quality.andP;  It can store 256-color VGAimages at 300K bytes per image.andP;  CD-ROM/XA development and delivery productswere in evidence in Boston, as the following examples show.andM;Toshiba previewed a SCSI XA decoder box that will be able to support SCSICD-ROM drives.andP;  CD-ROM drives of the current generation, in other words, willbe able to be interfaced with CD-ROM/XA adapters in the future.andM;Sony has an XA board that replaces the CD-ROM host interface card forSony-bus CD-ROM drives, making them into XA readers.andP;  Up to four drives canbe daisy-chained.andP;  Sony also showed an ADPCM encoder/decoder board for PCs tocompress audio for CD-I and CD-ROM/XA.andM;Meridian introduced multimedia authoring tools for CD-ROM/XA production:CD-Image, CD-Sound and CD-Merge.andP;  CD-Image (already running under Windows3.0) captures video images digitally and permits them to be optimized for usein XA presentations.andP;  CD-Sound digitizes and compresses audio into one of theXA-compatible ADPCM formats.andP;  CD-Merge, in conjunction with an XA simulationboard, merges the audio, image and other data into XA or CD-I format.andM;CDTV.andP;  Commodore CDTV was announced earlier this year at the spring ConsumerElectronics Show.andP;  In Boston, Nolan Bushnell, founder of Atari and now thegeneral manager of consumer interactive products at Commodore International,presented Commodore's vision of CDTV.andP;  He did this without demo hardware;apparently none of the 20 existing prototypes were available for CD-ROM Expo.andM;CDTV is a home/consumer interactive multimedia product based on an Amiga 500computer with 1 MB of RAM and a standard CD-ROM drive.andP;  The player has beenmade to look like a VCR or audio component.andP;  Input is through a remotecontrol unit held horizontally in &quot;Nintendo mode.&quot;andP;  Commodore expects theCDTV unit to be introduced soon at under $1,000 retail.andP;  It expects to sell200,000 to 500,000 units in 1991.andP;  Commodore wants to expand the marketbeyond the age 8 to 18 market for videogames and to interest more females ininteractive electronic entertainment.andM;CDTV is designed to be used ten feet from a television set.andP;  Several peoplecan use it at the same time.andP;  Applications should sell in the $19.95-$200range.andP;  Bushnell says Commodore wants to get the CDTV unit down to $499 byChristmas of 1991, when it should be available through mass merchandisingchannels.andP;  Since CDTV can read both conventional CD and CD + G (graphics)discs, it can serve as a conventional audio CD player when not being used forinteractive applications.andP;  This makes the aggressive pricing even moreattractive.andM;Initially CDTV will have quarter-screen full-motion video, but Commodoreplans to develop full-screen video capabilities around the MPEG standard asthat gets solidified around 1992.andM;Kodak Photo CD.andP;  The newest disc format was not in evidence at the show.andP;  InSeptember, Kodak announced that it is developing a product that will digitizephotographs from positive or negative film and record up to 100high-resolution images on a CD.andP;  Images can be viewed on a TV st (at TVresolution), or they can be output at high resolution.andM;Kodak does not expect this service to be available for another two years, butit is announcing it now in the hope that the consumer electronics andcomputer hardware vendors will include support for the Photo CD data formatin their CD-ROM readers.andM;Hedge your bets.andP;  Given the variety of competing interests, it is notsurprising that several companies are talking about players that will readmultiple formats, especially CD-audio, CD-ROM/XA, CD-I and Photo CD.andM;ImplicationsandM;CD-ROM has been a technology in search of applications for a long time now.andO;But despite the fairly long gestation period, the technology has not died.andO;There is just too much potential value in the ability to stamp out discs thatcontain 600 MB of data and that can be read by very low-cost drives.andM;The secret, of course, is that we are riding on the back of one of the mostsuccessful new consumer technologies of all time.andP;  The economies of scale inthe consumer market have driven down the cost of virtually everythingassociated with CDs, from mastering facilities to pressing plants to the costof the drives themselves.andM;ISO 9660 and Apple HFS format information products are becoming increasinglywell established in the market.andP;  The next battle will be over extending thetechnology to encompass more interactive multimedia applications andperforming the magic of squeezing acceptable-quality full-frame, full-motionvideo onto a medium that was originally intended only for digital audio.andM;At this point, it looks as if you will be seeing a lot more of the CD-ROM/XAtechnology for applications that do not require full-motion video.andP;  MPEG islikely to be the preferred solution for full-motion video.andP;  It appears thatboth CD-I and DVI will migrate in that direction.andM;We left the Boston show convinced that CD-ROM is a major &quot;continent&quot; in theemerging digital word.andP;  Many of the issues defining the future of publishingand communications are being worked out in this medium.andM;Bernard Banet is the owner of Optimation, a consulting and sales companyspecializing in optical storage devices.andP;  In the computer industry since1977, he has contributed articles to other Seybold publications in the past.andO;He can be contacted at 838 Heatherway, Ann Arbor, MI 48104; phone (313)665-7842, fax 665-7872.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
