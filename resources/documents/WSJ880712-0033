The move greatly enhances Knight-Ridder's presence in the booming electronic information retrieval business. Dialog is one of the largest providers of computer data bases in the world, with access to over 320 data bases on topics ranging from business to the humanities. It has more than 91,000 subscribers in 86 countries.    For the year ended Dec. 31, 1987, Dialog had net income of $9.2 million on revenue of $98.1 million.    In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Knight-Ridder closed at $43.50, up 37.5 cents.    Other media concerns have made similar forays. For example, last year, Dow Jones andamp; Co., which publishes this newspaper, increased to 56% its stake in Telerate Inc., a data base service.    The purchase price surprised some analysts. Lockheed put Dialog on the block last spring. At the time, industry executives said Lockheed was asking about $200 million, a price that many regarded as too high. Some analysts have raised questions about Dialog's prospects, arguing that an emerging compact-disk technology for delivering information services would require a sharp and potentially costly strategic shift.    A Knight-Ridder spokeswoman said, &quot;Obviously, we thought it was worth what we paid for it.&quot; She said the acquisition will help fuel Knight-Ridder's growth and has the added advantage of eliminating Dialog as a competitor.    Knight-Ridder said the acquisition will double the size of its business information services division, which includes operations such as Vu/Text, a data base that offers files from Knight-Ridder's 30 daily newspapers and several other sources.    The division had a loss of $1 million on revenue of $99 million in 1987, but a spokeswoman said the division's financial performance has turned around so far this year. Knight-Ridder had net income in 1987 of $155.2 million, or $2.65 a share, on revenue of $2.1 billion.    Like many big media conglomerates, Knight-Ridder views electronic information retrieval as a potential growth area at a time when many traditional newspapers are finding growth hard to come by. &quot;It's not that we think newspapers are dying, it's just that&quot; information retrieval is &quot;an area where we see some real growth opportunities into the 1990s,&quot; a spokesman said.    Knight-Ridder stumbled in one past push into information services. In 1984, it started Viewtron, a data base service for home users that provided recipes and pet-care tips, among other things. It flopped, and Knight-Ridder dropped it in 1986 after millions of dollars of losses. But the spokeswoman said Dialog is well-established and popular with librarians and other professional researchers. &quot;Dialog and Viewtron are very different, one major difference being that Dialog is successful and Viewtron is no more,&quot; she said.    Lockheed, Burbank, Calif., said it would use proceeds from the transaction to help reduce debt. </TEXT></DOC>
