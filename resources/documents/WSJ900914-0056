The 1991 model year begins Oct. 1, and auto makers arewheeling out some of the biggest and brawniest cars in years.There's General Motors Corp.'s Buick Roadmaster wagon, a4,415-pound monster with a V-8 engine that gets 16 miles tothe gallon in city driving. Ford Motor Co. is pitching itsown new V-8 engines, and Chrysler Corp. is offering teasingglimpses of a 10-cylinder super sports car called Viper.Japanese auto makers are also revving up: Mitsubishi MotorsCorp. is introducing a new 300-horsepower turbocharged sportscar, the 3000GT.</LP><TEXT>   The cars couldn't have arrived at a worse time, as far asthe on-again off-again energy debate is concerned. With oilconservation once again on the American agenda, the automakers are finding themselves accused of chasing quickprofits at the expense of saving gas. &quot;They are emphasizingpower and options and not efficiency,&quot; says Daniel Becker, alobbyist for the Sierra Club. &quot;At the same time the U.S. isbecoming more and more dependent on foreign oil, the automakers have been backsliding on fuel economy.&quot;   As early as today, the U.S. Senate may start considering abill that would require new car fleets to average about 34miles a gallon in five years, and 40 miles a gallon or moreby the year 2001. The bill's complex formula could requiresome manufacturers to hit even higher targets. The currentstandard is 27.5 mpg, a figure meant to represent the averagefuel efficiency for a manufacturer's entire line of cars.Small cars usually surpass that limit, large cars usuallyfall short.   The auto makers argue that the new targets are impossibleto meet because they are at least 20% higher than thefuel-economy levels achieved by cars currently on the road.Don't buy &quot;the illusion that drastic increases in governmentfuel economy standards are the answer to an oil crisis,&quot; thecar companies are saying in full-page newspaper ads. &quot;Theyare not.&quot;   But auto makers could do better -- and have in the past.New-car fuel economy was better two years ago than it istoday, and could improve again with some modest efforts.Sharply higher fuel-economy standards, however, could provehighly expensive to car companies and consumers alike. Automakers would have to rip up their current product programs,which were crafted in the cheap-gas era of the late 1980s.They would also have to build a far higher proportion ofsmall cars than they currently envision.   New technology will help, but there isn't any easysolution that will let Americans cruise around in big musclemobiles that get 40 miles to the gallon. Thus, many consumerswould have to settle for small cars instead of the Jeeps,minivans and luxury cars that they have been flocking to inrecent years.   &quot;The largest cars would have to be very small,&quot; saysauto-industry consultant George Peterson. &quot;In the case ofFord, a large car would be an Escort,&quot; the company'sbread-and-butter subcompact. In Italy, average automotivefuel economy is about 34 miles a gallon -- but 80% of thecars on the road are subcompacts.   The auto makers concede that, thanks to the Kuwait crisis,fuel-economy standards will get higher, even if the proposalbefore the Senate doesn't become law. The only question is,how much higher?   Many lawmakers haven't forgotten the last go-round in thisdebate. In the mid-1970s, Big Three executives insisted theycouldn't build cars that averaged better than 14 mpg.Congress ordered them to do it anyway. Now, many of thosesame executives boast about the technical achievements thathave nearly doubled the average fuel economy of their cars.   Still, Ford says it now costs the company $300 million to$500 million per model for every additional one-mile-a-gallonboost in fuel economy. And Big Three executives say they'verun out of technology to make steep gains. None of the BigThree currently meets today's federal fuel economy standardof 27.5 mpg. Without radical changes in car design, &quot;we don'tknow how to get to 35 miles per gallon by 1995,&quot; says RichardDonnelly, head of GM's engine division.   But people outside the industry have some hints. Forstarters, the auto makers might reconsider the latestconsumer-driven trend to put &quot;performance&quot; -- speed andacceleration -- ahead of fuel economy. &quot;A lot of thetechnology used in cars today isn't being used to milkmaximum fuel economy, but to increase driveability orperformance,&quot; says J. Dillard Murrell, who helped write anEnvironmental Protection Agency study of declining fueleconomy.   Cadillac, for example, notes that its bigger, 1991 V-8engines get 26 miles a gallon in highway driving, one mile agallon more than last year's models. But GM's decision toboost the engine's horsepower to 200 from 180 washed out apotentially greater fuel-economy gain from changes in theengine's design.   Ford, for its part, decided to offer a big V-8 engine inits Thunderbird this year for the first time in years. Ford'sgoal was to have the V-8 model average 23.5 miles per gallonin city and highway driving. The company found it couldexceed that goal by one mile per gallon, but chose not to.Instead, it redesigned the car to make it accelerate fromzero to 60 miles half a second faster, and got about 0.4miles less per gallon.   &quot;If you've got half a second improvement in performance,you've got to give up something to get it,&quot; says J.H.Kennedy, manager of specialty-car development at Ford.   The auto makers remind their critics that they are simplytrying to satisfy the customer. Indeed, today's &quot;horsepowerrace&quot; is a response to a drop in gasoline prices during thelate 1980s that put performance ahead of fuel efficiency onthe shopping list of most Americans. Sales of subcompact carshave fallen 18% in the past year, while overall auto salesdropped only slightly.   Also, GM got badly burned in 1986 when it built severalradically smaller luxury cars -- Cadillacs, Buicks andOldsmobiles -- just as gasoline prices plunged. Sales ofthose models plunged as well, idling thousands of workers andlots of expensive machinery. Only after GM hastily made thecars big again did sales start to recover.   The car companies raise another point: At Washington'sinsistence, they have shifted their focus from fuel-economyto making cars safer and less polluting, and that can workagainst saving gas. Making a car safer often means making itheavier by adding steel door beams or airbag hardware. Andtuning engines to run cleaner often results in diminishedfuel economy, partly because extra anti-pollution equipmentadds weight.   The car companies say they can't simply turn on a dimenow. Product plans are set years in advance. Thus, the automakers have been designing cars for the mid-1990s to meetdemand for bigger, more powerful cars.   Consider GM's Buick Roadmaster wagon and its sister cars,the Chevrolet Caprice and Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham. Duringthe early 1980s, GM expected gas would rise to $2 a gallon ormore by 1990. Production of the rear-wheel-drive -- and thusheavier -- full-size Buick Estate Wagon was scheduled to end,and the Caprice was to be replaced by a mid-sized,front-wheel-drive model.   But when gasoline prices dropped, strong sales of the carsled GM to decide to keep them big. It invested hundreds ofmillions of dollars to update the Caprice and its siblingcars and commited two factories to build them. It took sixmonths just to retool one of the factories.   Now, the new Roadmaster and Caprice are hitting the market-- just in time for another oil shock. GM could redesign thecars as smaller, front-drive models, but that would takeanother three to five years and up to $1 billion.   GM isn't alone in this dilemma. Of 37 North American carplants operated by the Big Three, 29 now build cars thataverage less than 27.5 miles per gallon. Like theircounterparts at GM, designers at Ford and Chrysler areworking now on models for the mid-1990s. From afuel-efficiency standpoint, many of these vehicles will beonly marginally more economical than current products.   All this reflects the fact that the Big Three still relyon mid-sized and large cars for the bulk of their U.S.automotive profits. &quot;GM and Ford have used large, luxury carsas cash cows,&quot; says John Casesa, industry analyst with theWertheim, Schroder andamp; Co. securities firm. Giving those carsup &quot;could have a terrible impact on profitability,&quot; he says.   Even Japanese firms will have trouble doing a 180-degreeturn on fuel economy. They sell lots of gas-sippingsubcompacts, and have better overall fuel economy scores thanthe Big Three. But the Japanese have been invading the marketfor mid-sized and luxury cars with startling success --introducing some cars that slurp more fuel per mile thantheir American rivals. Nissan Motor Co.'s Infiniti Q45, forexample, has a V-8 engine and averages 21.5 miles per gallon.   Technological advances may help the auto industry liftfuel economy. Multivalve engines, for example, have three orfour valves for each cylinder instead of the standard two,which adds more air to the combustion mixture and thus makesfuel burn more efficiently. A car now powered by a 2.5-literconventional engine could get the same performance with a2-liter multivalve engine, says environmental consultant K.G.Duleep. The smaller, lighter multi-valve engine would use 8%less gasprovided the technology isn't used just to improveacceleration, Mr. Duleep says.   But even if GM, Ford and Chrysler put multi-valve enginesin all their vehicles over the next several years, engineersat those companies say they couldn't meet fleet targets ashigh as 35 or 40 mpg without substantially cutting the numberof large cars they sell.   They point to the experience of Toyota Motor Corp. ItsCamry is a five-passenger, front-wheel-drive sedan that fitsthe ideal car profile laid out by federal regulators. Itcomes with a standard 16-valve, four-cylinder engine and anelectronically controlled transmission, and it has highquality standards. Yet it averages less than 33 miles pergallon.   That's why Toyota officials moan about proposals to raisestandards to as high as 40 mpg. To hit that level, mostToyotas sold in the U.S. would have to be tiny cars like the39-mpg subcompact Tercel. Toyota's highly successful,250-horsepower Lexus LS 400 luxury sedan, which sells for$38,000, averages just 23.5 miles a gallon. &quot;We would be anall-Tercel company,&quot; says a Toyota spokesman.   Moreover, blockbuster advances in fuel savings, such ascommercially viable electric cars or two-stroke engines thatget 40 or 50 miles to the gallon, aren't coming any timesoon. GM says it must solve a number of technical problems toput its much-publicized Impact electric car on the road, evenin limited numbers.   Vehicles powered by propane or methanol are in use inparts of the country. But auto makers don't have themachinery to mass-produce these cars. And it will take timefor alternative fuels to become universally available.   Auto makers can cut the weight of cars using plastic oraluminum instead of steel in bumpers, doors and other parts.But these materials cost more than steel, and in some casesentail sacrifices in appearance and durability. And in returnfor higher prices, consumers would get only marginalfuel-economy improvement -- unless cars also were madesmaller.   But auto makers may have little choice as they reckon withnew oil prices. Chrysler recently postponed plans to build abig rear-wheel-drive luxury car in the mid-1990s and will usethe money to develop a compact sedan instead. GM has decidedagainst putting a 5.7-liter V-8 engine in the BuickRoadmaster wagon.   Auto makers also are starting to revamp their marketingpitches to tilt, once again, toward fuel economy. But if thepreferences of some industry observers are any guide, it willbe a tough sell in the absence of gas lines. Mr. Duleep, theenergy conservation expert, drives a 1989 Nissan Maxima, amuscular car that gets just 19 miles to the gallon in thecity. Says Mr. Duleep: &quot;I have to use up my share of gasbefore everybody else does.&quot;   ---                       Gas Guzzlers                                                                                                          Ten worst cars for gasoline efficiency, 1990 figures                                                                                                                                                  MILES PER GALLON                                                                                                                                                  CITY     HIGHWAY                                                                                                          Lamborghini Countach                      6        10                                                                                                          Rolls-Royce Bentley Continental          10        13                                                                                                          Rolls-Royce Corniche III                 10        13                                                                                                          Rolls-Royce Silver Spirit II   and Silver Spur                          10        13                                                                                                          Rolls-Royce Bentley Eight   and Mulsane                              10        13                                                                                                          Ferrari Testarossa                       10        15                                                                                                          BMW 750 IL                               12        18                                                                                                          Porsche 928 S4                           13        19                                                                                                          Audi V8                                  14        18                                                                                                          Maserati 228                             14        19                                                                                                          ---               The Politics of Conservation                                                                                                                            Competing Claims                                                                                                          Conservation advocates and auto industry officialsdisagree sharply on the fuel-saving potential of certain newautomotive technologies.
