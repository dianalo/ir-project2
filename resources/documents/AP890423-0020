Ms. Schrammtold The Associated Press the Alternative List strongly opposesBush's stand on a number of issues.   ``We do not like the policies of the United States in relationto Nicaragua, its pressure (on Germany and other NATO members) tomodernize short-range nuclear weapons, and that it has not graspedopportunities for disarmament,'' Ms. Schramm said.   She said the Alternative List played no part in the decisionlast week by West Berlin Mayor Walter Momper to invite Bush. Shesaid if Bush comes he will be met with demonstrations and that herparty will take part.   There has been no announcement of whether Bush might travel toBerlin.   He visits West Germany next month, arriving in Bonn May 30 andleaving the following day after talks with Chancellor Helmut Kohland other officials.   Bush also plans to take a boat ride on the Rhine River, butthere are no plans for a trip to West Berlin, diplomatic sourcessay.   The Alternative List is the junior partner in the coalitiongovernment led by Momper's mainstream Social Democrats. The unionresulted from the election defeat of the governing ChristianDemocrats in January.   It has been an uneasy political marriage because of theAlternative List's often far-left views on key matters.   The Alternative List and its sister party, the Greens, have inthe past helped stage huge anti-U.S. demonstrations.</TEXT></DOC>
