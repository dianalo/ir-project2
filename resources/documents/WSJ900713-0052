The committee's MX decision, coming as the lawmakers metbehind closed doors, repudiated a major building block of theBush administration's nuclear-weapons policies and showed awidening rift between Democrats and Republicans on the panel.Details of the bill, which were still being hammered out latelast night, are scheduled to be announced today.</LP><TEXT>   The White House did receive some good news when thecommittee voted to maintain Pentagon spending for theStrategic Defense Initiative at this year's level of about$3.5 billion, according to lawmakers and their aides. Thepanel also agreed to keep the embattled B-2 Stealth bomberalive by authorizing the purchase of another pair of theradar-evading planes in the fiscal year starting Oct. 1.   All of the important decisions are bound to be debatedagain on the Senate floor. The House version of the bill isexpected to reject deployment of the mobile MX missile too,but it is likely to call for lower levels of spending on SDIand the B-2.   Sen. Malcolm Wallop (R., Wyo.), one of the leading GOPadvocates of heftier spending for SDI, mobile missiles andthe B-2, said that the important decisions in the Senatepanel &quot;came on straight party-line votes. It's all being doneby rote.&quot;   The committee was so divided that some GOP lawmakers evenraised last-minute objections to a politically popularportion of the bill that would require the military to helpcivilian agencies collect global pollution data and focuspart of the Pentagon's research on environmental clean-upprojects. The proposal, pushed by the committee's chairman,Sam Nunn (D., Ga.), is expected to be part of the finallegislation.   The spending bill, according to lawmakers, puts the MX andthe smaller, single-warhead Midgetman mobile missile on theback burner by capping 1991 funding at about $700 million forboth weapons. None of the money, however, could be used fordeployment. In addition, aides said the committee was movingto cut the administration request for building additionalTrident ballistic-missile submarines and Seawolf attacksubmarines.   As expected, the committee voted to cut 100,000 troops in1991. That figure could climb higher if Pentagon outlays arecapped at a level less than the committee anticipated. Overthe next five years, Sen. Alan Dixon (D., Ill.) said thepanel envisions slashing some 500,000 troops from the 2.1million people currently on active duty.   Sen. Nunn had advocated the $289 billionspending-authority limit, which would be $18 billion lessthan President Bush's January budget request. The committeesketched out at least another $4 billion in potential cutsthat could take effect if a bipartisan budget agreementrequires further Pentagon spending reductions.</TEXT></DOC>
