KEATING Jr. _ A Phoenix millionaire who, as chairmanof a home construction company, American Continental Corp.,purchased Lincoln in February 1984 for $51 million and increasedits assets from $1.1 billion to $5.5 billion by 1988. Keating wageda fervent five-year campaign against federal thrift regulators whoopposed his direct investment of federally insured Sandamp;L deposits inreal estate ventures. In 1986 and 1987 he contributed a total of$1.3 million to the political causes of five senators whointervened on Lincoln's behalf with officials of the Federal HomeLoan Bank Board. Lincoln was seized by the board last April andregulators have filed a $1.1 billion fraud and racketeering suitagainst Keating.   EDWIN J. GRAY _ A former White House official who, as chairmanof the bank board from 1983 until July 1987, sought to limit directinvestments by thrifts and was sued several times by Keating. InMay 1987, Gray deferred action on a recommendation by regulators atthe Federal Home Loan Bank in San Francisco that Lincoln be takenover by the government because of what they said were unsafe andunsound lending practices. Gray told the House committee he wassummoned to an April 2, 1987, meeting in the office of Sen. DennisDeConcini, D-Ariz., that was arranged by Sen. Donald W. Reigle,D-Mich. At that meeting and in the presence of three othersenators, Gray said DeConcini asked him ``on behalf of their friendand contributor'' at Lincoln to rescind a regulation curbing directinvestments by thrifts. Gray subsequently arranged a two-hourmeeting April 9, 1987, in DeConcini's office between five senatorsand San Francisco Home Loan Bank officials then trying to closeLincoln.   M. DANNY WALL _ A former banking aide to Sen. Jake Garn, R-Utah,succeeded Gray as chairman of the bank board. Wall has been thechief target of the House Banking Committee's chairman, who lastmonth asked President Bush in a letter to fire him. Wall has saidthe board did not follow the San Francisco officials'recommendation to seize Lincoln because proof was insufficient tojustify the action.   SEN. DENNIS DeCONCINI, D-Ariz. _ Hosted in his office in April1987 two meetings between thrift regulators and other senators.DeConcini received $48,100 from Keating and his associates for 1988re-election campaign but announced two months ago he would returnthe money. Early this year he called Wall twice and also Californiastate regulators urging approval for Keating to sell Lincoln as analternative to the government seizing it. DeConcini has deniedGray's account of the April 2 meeting.   SEN. ALAN CRANSTON, D-Calif. _ Met with Gray on April 2, 1987,and the following week with San Francisco examiners, both inDeConcini's office. Cranston, the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate asthe party's whip, also called Wall and California state regulatorsearlier this year urging approval for Keating to sell Lincoln. Forhis 1986 re-election campaign, Cranston received $39,000 fromKeating and his associates. He also solicited from Keating $850,000for three voter education projects in California and $85,000 forthe California Democratic Party.   SEN. JOHN McCAIN, R-Ariz. _ Attended April 2 and April 9meetings in DeConcini's office; received $112,000 in campaigncontributions from Keating and his associates. McCain said earlierthis year he was reimbursing American Continental $13,433 forflights he and his family took aboard Keating's corporate planes toand from the Bahamas in 1984-86.   SEN. JOHN GLENN, D-Ohio _ Attended April 2 and April 9 meetingsin DeConcini's office, where regulators quoted him as telling themto either make a case against Lincoln or ``get off its back.'' Acandidate for his party's presidential nomination in 1984, theformer astronaut received $34,000 in direct political contributionsfrom Keating and his associates and a political action committeeassociated with Glenn received another $200,000.   SEN. DONALD W. RIEGLE Jr. _ Met several times in 1987 withKeating or his associates and, according to Gray, first told himthat he would be summoned to the April 2 meeting in DeConcini'soffice. Riegle did not attend that meeting but was present at themeeting April 9 with San Francisco regulators. Riegle received a$76,100 from Keating and his associates for his 1988 re-electioncampaign but announced later he was returning the money.   REP. HENRY B. GONZALEZ, D-Texas _ As chairman of the HouseBanking Committee, has directed a six-hearing investigation intowhy Lincoln was allowed to stay open for two years after examinersrecommended seizing it. For a year, Gonzalez has blamed the size ofthe Sandamp;L crisis on Wall and has attempted to focus the Lincolnhearings on him. Last month he asked President Bush to fire Wall.   MICHAEL PATRIARCA and WILLIAM K. BLACK _ Respectively, theprincipal agent in charge of the San Francisco Bank Board officeand its top lawyer. On May 1, 1987, they recommended that Lincolnbe seized following a year-long examination of the thrift.Patriarca and Black were the chief regulators summoned to the April9, 1987, meeting in DeConcini's office and are now portrayed byHouse Banking Committee members as the unsung heroes in the Lincolncase.   ROBERT S. BENNETT _ A Washington attorney specializing in whitecollar crime, was hired by the Senate Ethics Committee last week tohead an investigation into the role played by the five senators inthe Lincoln case. Bennett is a brother of former EducationSecretary William J. Bennett, now director of the White HouseOffice of Drug Control Policy.</TEXT></DOC>
