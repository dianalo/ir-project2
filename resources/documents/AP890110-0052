Russian emigre Vladimir Sokolov, 75, disappeared in July, whenthe deportation hearing was to have been held in Hartford, Conn.   His whereabouts were unknown until he applied for refugee statusin Montreal sometime before Jan. 1, claiming his life would be indanger if he were forced to return to the Soviet Union, the CanadianBroadcast Corp. reported Monday night.   No date has been set for an immigration hearing, the report said.   From 1942 to 1944, Sokolov was a writer and editor of a Russianlanguage newspaper German army occupiers published in his hometownof Orel, 220 miles south of Moscow. Anti-Semitic articles appearedunder his name, although he has maintained that the most offensivetracts were written by Nazi censors.   Nevertheless, the German army awarded Sokolov medals for his work.   Sokolov's Canadian lawyer, Julius Grey, contended there were nogrounds to return his client to the United States ``since he's outof the country, he's not in violation of any law.''   ``The Soviet press has been gloating over his return and havecalled him a traitor,'' Grey said. ``He would likely be put to deathor given a lengthy sentence. For all practical purposes it would bethe end of his life.''   CBC quoted the Soviet embassy in Ottawa as saying they were awareof the Sokolov case but did not know whether there are chargesagainst him in the Soviet Union.   Grey said Sokolov is in very poor health.   In one World War II article that appeared under Sokolov's name,Jews were compared to rats. The article expressed the hope thatduring the war, Jews would ``be destroyed finally and forever.''   Grey, who is Jewish, said his client ``certainly doesn't exhibitany (anti-Semitic) ideas now, whether he ever had them or not.''   ``Even if he did write those scurrilous articles 40 years agoit's not an overwhelming thing. He's never been accused or chargedwith a war crime _ the test for war crimes is, `Did you commit anyatrocities?'''   The Nazis systematically murdered 6 million Jews in what theycalled The Final Solution.   Sokolov failed to reveal his wartime activities in 1951 when heentered the United States as a displaced person.   He became a citizen in 1957 and two years later began lecturingon Russian language and Soviet dissident literature at Yale.   His past was uncovered by the Yale student paper in 1976 and helater resigned. But the U.S. government waited until 1982 beforefiling a complaint to strip him of his U.S citizenship.   U.S. District Judge Thomas F. Murphy stripped Sokolov of hiscitizenship in 1986, finding that he had concealed his Nazi past.</TEXT></DOC>
