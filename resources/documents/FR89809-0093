The Commissionis publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule changefrom interested persons.<ITAG tagnum="85">I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substanceof the Proposed Rule Change</ITAG>The Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PHLX'' or the ``Exchange'') proposesto adopt a policy that would allow an affiliated broker-dealer specialistunit of a corporate issuer of currency warrants (``warrants'') to be eligibleto become the registered specialist in such warrents listed and eligiblefor trading on the Exchange pursuant to its previously adopted currencywarrent listing standards of PHLX Rule 803. <T3>See </T3>SR-PHLX-87-21.<ITAG tagnum="85">II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, andStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change</ITAG>In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization includedstatements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule changeand discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. Thetext of these statements may be examined at the places specified in ItemIV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, setforth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspectsof such statements.A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statements of the Purpose of, and StatutoryBasis for the Proposed Rule ChangeWhile the Exchange, like other regional exchanges, does not have formalisolation and restriction requirements relating to its equity specialists(``Chinese Wall'' requirements), the Exchange intends to give heightenedscrutiny to the activities of any specialist unit in warrants that is affiliatedwith an issuer of such warrants. In this regard, the PHLX intends to evaluateeach instance of an affiliated broker-dealer specialist unit of an issuerpursuing registration in warrants to assure compliance with the policiesspecified below. In each instance, the broker-dealer would have to satisfythe PHLX that it and the issuer of the warrants had received a no-actionletter from the Commission, substantially to the effect that Rule 10b-6under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ``Exchange Act''),will not apply to the activities of the broker-dealer's proposed specialistunit prior to or during distributions by an affiliated issuer of additionalwarrants of the same class or series.The issuer of the warrants and its affiliated broker-dealer would alsohave to satisfy PHLX that they have imposed, and have adequate means ofenforcing, appropriate Chinese Wall procedures respecting the proposedspecialist operations of the broker-dealer. The Exchange considers theimposition of such procedures to be essential to the maintenance of a fairand orderly market in the warrants. In particular, the Exchange believesthat the affiliation of an issuer of warrants with a broker-dealer thatalso acts as specialist in the warrants presents two concerns. First, thereis a potential for conflicts of interest if the broker-dealer's customeractivities are not adequately isolated from the specialist's activities.Second, although the warrants are expected to trade primarily based onmovements in the foreign exchange market and should not react significantlyto issuer-specific information, there is a potential for misuse of materialnon-public information regarding the issuer if access by the specialistunit to that information is not restricted. In view of the seriousnessof these concerns, the Exchange will not permit an affiliated broker-dealerto commence its specialist operations in the warrants until the broker-dealerand the issuer have demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Exchange theircompliance with the Exchange's Chinese Wall policies.To effect its policy and to protect against conflicts of interest withthe broker-dealer's customers who trade in the warrants, the Exchange intendsto review the broker-dealer's policies with respect to information flowbetween the retail operations of the broker-dealer and its specialist unit.To protect against abuse of material non-public information regarding theissuer of the warrants, the Exchange likewise intends to review the firm'spolicies regarding the dissemination of such information within the issuerand its affiliates, particularly the proposed specialist unit, such asthe existence of an appropriate employee confidentiality policy and otherrestrictions on dissemination of information.The Exchange recognizes that the nature of the proposed Chinese Wall proceduresmay vary. Accordingly, the Exchange intends to review the viability ofsuch procedures on a case-by-case basis. In connection with its reviewof Chinese Wall procedures, the Exchange will discuss the adequacy of existingprocedures with all relevant compliance departments and will give specialconsideration to the ability of such departments to monitor the agreedupon procedures. The Exchange will also monitor compliance with such proceduresduring the term of the specialist's operations.The PHLX has not chosen to require isolation and restriction of the broker-dealer'sspecialist unit from other affiliated proprietary foreign currency tradingoperations primarily because it believes that a currency warrant producttraded by an affiliated broker-dealer specialist unit of an issuer presentsfundamentally different circumstances from those presented by an affiliatedbroker-dealer specialist unit in a listed or over-the-counter equity optionor other type of listed debt issue. The primary difference is the factthat, unlike options on corporate equity and debt issues, the prices ofwhich depend on the current state of the issuer's business, the price ofa currency warrant product largely depends on the relationship of the spotand forward foreign currency markets, a relationship that may be trackedover time through the use of any options pricing model. Moreover, the spotand forward foreign exchange markets, as well as the related derivativemarkets, are deep, liquid and subject to the price disciplines ordinarilyassociated with mature, integrated cash and forward markets.Given the size of these markets, the multiplicity of market participantsand the mathematical price relationship between the cash and forward marketsand the market for the warrants, the ability of any broker-dealer, specialistunit and/or proprietary trading desk (including those of a broker-dealeraffiliated with the issuer) to affect even the short term market for thewarrants is remote. A barrier between a broker-dealer's specialist andforeign exchange operations would thus have little effect on the secondarymarket, but would probably make it impracticable for any firm to act asa specialist in the warrants, since the specialist's ability to set appropriatepricing and market trading levels depends on its access to informationconcerning the behavior of the remainder of the foreign exchange market.Moreover, if it were appropriate to prevent specialist access to such information,then any such restriction would apply to all specialists rather than onlythose affiliated with the issuer_a proposition that has not, to the knowledgeof the Exchange, been implemented or suggested. Although, based on theforegoing, the PHLX does not believe that additional Chinese Wall proceduresin this area are necessary, the PHLX committed to utilizing its foreigncurrency options surveillance program to detect any discrepancies betweenprevailing spot and forward currency prices related to the warrants andto review promptly any reports of purported market manipulation.The Commission has asked the Exchange to address whether approval for listingand trading of warrants by an affiliated broker-dealer specialist unitof an issuer would potentially result in an undesired proliferation ofsuch products. As required in SR-PHLX-87-21, listed foreign currency warrantswould be obligations of their issuer, registered with the Commission andsubject to cash settlement in U.S. dollars during a limited term from theirdate of issuance. Moreover, the issuer of the warrants must have at least250,000 warrants outstanding, exclusive of concentrated holdings and thoseof officers and directors, and at least 500 holders of a class of equitysecurities which would otherwise be eligible for listing. The warrant issuermust have such assets at the issuance of the warrants so that there isa reasonable expectation that it will have sufficient means to meet itssettlement obligations. In this regard, PHLX Rule 803 will be strictlyenforced to require that the issuer will have at least $1 million net tangibleassets.The aforementioned listing requirements, to a great extent, will limitthe number of potential issuers. The PHLX believes that a limited numberof potential issuers would concentrate their currency warrant and relatedissues in only the most liquid foreign currencies, <T3>i.e., </T3>the Deutsche Mark, Yen, British Pound, and Swiss Franc.The PHLX anticipates that the market would be characterized by participationof a limited number of sophisticated institutional investors to whom fulldisclosure respecting the securities and the credit and market risk ofdealing with another currency warrant market participant was known. Evenif this is not the case, the PHLX has, in any event, agreed that althoughwarrants are generally classified as equity products, currency warrantswill be subject to requirements applicable to options sales practices,including options suitability requirements. <T3>See </T3>SR-PHLX-87-21.The Commission has also asked the Exchange to address whether approvalof a registration of an affiliated broker-dealer specialist unit in warrantsof an issuer might pose a problem respecting whether the potential removalor reallocation of warrants from the specialist affiliated with the issuer,for disciplinary or performance grounds, would unduly affect the secondarymarket for such warrants. The PHLX currently trades a significantly diversifiedlist of products in the financial markets utilized by a wide spectrum ofmarket participants. The Exchange would apply it rules respecting reallocationwhen, and if, necessary, and would endeavor to secure a registered specialistunit with sufficient capital to commit to the maintenance of fair and orderlymarkets with consistency and continuity of pricing in the warrants. The Exchange cannot at this time give any further assurances that the withdrawlof an affiliated broker-dealer specialist unit of an issuer of warrantswould not affect the depth and liquidity in the secondary market for suchwarrants. This is a risk of which market participants are cognizant whenthey participate in trading activity in securities currently traded bythe Exchange on a primary market basis. In this regard, the PHLX believesthat as a result of the recent growth and commitment of significant capitalresources by an increasing number of broker-dealer member organizations,it would be able to secure a competent replacement registered specialistunit for the warrants should the need so arise. The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the ExchangeAct, which provides, in part, that the rules of the Exchange be designedto prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to facilitatetransactions in securities, and to remove impediments to and perfect themechanism of a free and open market. B. <T3>Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition</T3>The PHLX does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose anyburden on competition. C. <T3>Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the ProposedRule Change Received from Members, Participants, or Others</T3>No written comments were either solicited or received. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. <T4>Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for CommissionAction</T4></ITAG>Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>or within such longer period (i) as the Commissionmay designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer periodto be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as towhich the self-regulatory organization consents, the Commission will:(A) By order approve such proposed rule change, or,(B) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule changeshould be disapproved. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV.
