In a suit filed in U.S. District Court in Tallahassee, thestate attorney general, Bob Butterworth, said the companies,Abbott Laboratories, American Home Products Corp. andBristol-Myers Squibb Co., conspired to fix prices for infantformula, to monopolize the market for the product, and to rigbids.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;This conspiracy,&quot; Mr. Butterworth said in a statement,&quot;ultimately exploits young mothers who often have no choicein whether or not to buy infant formula.&quot;   The suit, the first by a state against infant-formulamakers, comes as the Federal Trade Commission continues asix-month investigation of alleged price-fixing within the$1.6 billion industry.   The FTC, according to company officials and othersfamiliar with the investigation, has subpoenaed internalpricing documents from all major manufacturers of infantformula, including Abbott, American Home and Bristol-Myers.The FTC has said its interest in possible collusion stemsfrom the large part that infant formula plays in the federalfood program for poor women and children.   All three companies have denied any wrongdoing inconnection with the federal investigation.   Regarding the action in Florida, a spokeswoman forBristol-Myers, based in New York, said the company was awarethat the suit had been filed but couldn't comment onparticulars because it hadn't seen the documents. Thespokeswoman added, however, that officials at Bristol-Myers&quot;have not, do not and will not discuss pricing or marketingpractices with competitors.&quot;   A spokeswoman for Wyeth Ayerst Laboratories, a division ofNew York-based American Home, said the company deniesviolating any antitrust laws. She added that Wyeth Ayerst&quot;sets its infant-formula prices independently, and competesstrongly and independently in all aspects of itsinfant-formula business.&quot; A spokesman for Abbott, based inAbbott Park, Ill., characterized the allegations as &quot;untrue&quot;and said the company &quot;hasn't engaged in price fixing, bidrigging or any other illegal behavior.&quot;   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,Abbott closed at $41.625, down $1.625, American Home fell$1.375 to $50.75, and Bristol-Myers closed at $64.375, down$2.25.   Mr. Butterworth said the three companies, rather thanselling their infant formula directly to consumers,encouraged physicians and hospitals to recommend the productto patients. In exchange for their endorsement, Mr.Butterworth added, hospitals and doctors received freesamples of formula and other baby products, as well as cashgrants and research grants.   Between December 1979 and December 1989, state officialssaid, the wholesale price of infant formula sold by the threecompanies jumped an average of 155.4%. By comparison, theprice of milk during the same period rose 36.4%. The price ofdairy products increased 41.8%, while the price of groceriesin general rose 50.8%   &quot;It's basically profiteering,&quot; said Jerome Hoffman, chiefof the antitrust division in the Florida attorney general'soffice. &quot;For a lot of people, {infant formula} is somethingthey can't do without, and it's something we couldn't turn ablind eye toward.&quot;   The state has asked the court to award triple the amountof damages determined by a jury, as well as civil penaltiesof as much as $1 million for each violation of state law.</TEXT></DOC>
