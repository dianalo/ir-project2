All ions up to uranium will be accelerated upto specific energies of 1-2 GeV/u. Secondary beams of radioactive isotopeswill be produced with a high rate and efficiently separated by the projectile-fragmentseparator (PFS), presently under construction. The separated fragmentscan be investigated at the foci of the separator, or they will be injectedinto the storage- and cooler-ring ESR for experiments in the ring. Usingthe cooling facilities of the ESR the phase-space density of the radioactivebeam is highly increased, i.e. the momentum spread is reduced to approximately10/sup -5/ allowing to decelerate down to the Coulomb barrier. This speciallyprepared beam can be extracted from the ESR and delivered to the differentexperimental facilities in the main experimental area.</TEXT></DOC>
