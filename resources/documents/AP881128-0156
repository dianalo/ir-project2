But before the day was out, one oil minister indicated his newquota was not official, causing prices to back off after a sharprunup.   The accord, which ended the winter meeting of the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries, set an output ceiling of 18.5 millionbarrels a day for the 13 OPEC members, well under the 22.5 millionthat analysts estimate the cartel is currently pumping.   The agreement also resolved a key issue in the talks by givingformer combatants Iran and Iraq equal quotas of 2.64 million barrelsa day.   After the agreement was announced, futures prices for West TexasIntermediate, a major U.S. brand, jumped as high as $15.80 dollars abarrel, up more than $1.80 from its close last week on the New YorkMercantile Exchange.   But prices slipped toward the end of the day after the oilminister of the United Arab Emirates said the output level set inthe accord was not his official ceiling.   The price of West Texas Intermediate for January delivery stillmanaged to settle up $1.06 per barrel at $15.03.   A pickup in crude prices _ if it holds _ could mean highergasoline prices at the pump, although oil companies do notnecessarily pass along the full increase.   Each one dollar rise in the price of crude oil theoreticallymeans a pickup of 2.5 cents a gallon in retail gasoline prices.   The agreement takes effect Jan. 1 for six months. OPEC PresidentRilwanu Lukman of Nigeria predicted prices could reach $18 a barrel``maybe by June.''   ``I wouldn't mind it tomorrow,'' he told a news conference, ``butit's not possible.''   He said that if the countries cut their production as required,prices will get a strong lift.   Saudi Arabia's oil minister, Hisham Nazer, predicted the accord``will have a very positive effect on the oil market.''   Indonesia's oil minister, Ginandjar Kartasasmita, predicted the$18 mark could be reached by next winter.   ``It's a victory for OPEC,'' said Issam Abdul Raheem al-Chalabi,oil minister of Iraq.   Feredoon Barkeshli, senior Iranian delegate, said, ``I'm happyabout it.''   Iran, which until the agreement had vowed never to permit Iraq anequal quota, had a cap of 2.4 million under the cartel's previousagreement and Iraq, 1.5 million.   Iran retains its 14.27 percent share of total OPEC output underthe new accord. Iraq has the same portion.   Other countries, however, lost a bit of their share to Iraq.   Saudi Arabia, the world's largest exporter, was given a 24.5percent share of total output, compared to 26.2 percent previously.Its daily quota will be 4.52 million barrels, up from 4.34 millionbarrels.   The new agreement promises steps will be taken to try to keepprices up and countries from cheating on their quotas. Past OPECagreements have unraveled when the members cheated by exceedingtheir ceilings.   The statement by Mana Saeed Otaiba, the United Arab Emiratesminister, hinted at early trouble with the agreement. But PaulMlotok, an analyst at Salomon Brothers in New York, said thestatement ``shouldn't surprise anyone'' because of the country'srepeated overproduction in the past.   He said he expected the agreement ``to largely hold. There'sgoing to be one main cheater (the United Arab Emirates).''   ``As long as that is all,'' he said, ``they won't fare toobadly.''   A critical element of the agreement was the inclusion of Iraq. Itrefused to join the accord arranged in 1986, because it wanted thesame production ceiling as bitter rival Iran.   ``We are happy to be back,'' said al-Chalabi.   The meeting closed Monday with the approval of the agreement. Thenext ministerial meeting will be June 5.   OPEC members are Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq,Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates,and Venezuela.</TEXT></DOC>
