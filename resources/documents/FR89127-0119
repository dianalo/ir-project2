Background</ITAG>On October 7, 1989, the GATT Contracting Parties received Bolivia's requestto accede to the General Agreement pursuant to Article XXXIII. A WorkingParty to examine this request, composed of interested GATT members wasestablished. The Working Party will consider the application of Boliviafor full accession, examine its foreign trade regime, and submit to theGATT Council recommendations that may include a draft Protocol of Accession.The Protocol of Accession that Bolivia negotiates with the ContractingParties will set forth the agreed terms of Bolivia's GATT membership, includingthe relationship of its foreign trade regime to the Articles of the GeneralAgreement. Aspects of a country's foreign trade regime that are normallyexamined in such negotiations include: licensing requirements, quantitativetrade restrictions, subsidy practices, nontariff charges and taxes, customsvaluation and classification procedures, and state trading practices andmonopolies. In addition, as part of the accession process, Bolivia willalso conduct bilateral negotiations with interested GATT members to formulatea schedule of tariff concessions that will become part of its Protocolof Accession. These concessions will consist of Bolivia's agreement tobind the tariffs applied to certain imports, restricting its ability toincrease the tariff rate applied to those items without offering appropriatecompensatory tariff concessions on other items. The advantages to Bolivia of GATT membership are several. As a GATT member,Bolivia will enjoy a multilateral guarantee of unconditional most favorednation treatment from all other GATT contracting parties that is more comprehensivethan that available through bilateral agreements. The bindings on tariffsmaintained in the tariff schedules of other GATT contracting parties willbe extended to Bolivian imports as obligations under the GATT, and Boliviawill enjoy the injury test on duty free trade involved in U.S. countervailingduty investigations. Bolivia will also have recourse to GATT proceduresto protect itself from unfair or unreasonable trade actions by its tradingpartners. Through the dispute settlement provisions in the General Agreement,member countries are able to utilize a multilateral forum, largely independentof the political pressures influencing bilateral relationships, to resolvedisputes. As an applicant for GATT contracting party status, Bolivia willalso have the opportunity to participate in all apsects of the UruguayRound of Multilateral Negotiations. In return for these benefits, Bolivia will be expected to conduct its tradepolicies in accordance with the rules set out in the General Agreementand to establish its own schedule of tariff concessions. <ITAG tagnum="84">3.
