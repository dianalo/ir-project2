The IRS ruling came one day after the head of the organization, Carl &quot;Spitz&quot; Channell, pleaded guilty to conspiring to defraud the government by funneling $2.1 million in tax-exempt donations to arm the insurgents known as Contras. Mr. Channell said in court that fired White House aide Lt. Col. Oliver North participated in the scheme.    The IRS said that previous donors won't be liable for additional taxes if they didn't know their gifts were being used in a way that that didn't qualify for tax deductions.    Established in 1984, the endowment has grown rapidly as the flagship for Mr. Channell's fund-raising efforts. Last year it reported an estimated 7.1 million in revenues. It owes its success in part to Mr. Channell's close ties to the White House. </TEXT></DOC>
