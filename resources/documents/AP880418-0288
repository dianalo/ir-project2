Olson, whose bulldog tenacity led himfrom manholes in North Dakota to the chairmanship of ATandamp;T, diedunexpectedly Monday after a month-long battle with colon cancer. Hewas 62.   His death came after just 1{ years as leader of AmericanTelephone andamp; Telegraph Co. The powerfully built chief executive hadcut costs and shaken the company out of the sense of drift thatfollowed the 1984 breakup of the Bell System.   ``Olson did what a lot of people thought was impossible. Hereally started to turn the company around,'' said Daniel Rosenbaum,executive editor of Wiretap, a newsletter in Morristown, N.J.   Robert E. Allen, 53, ATandamp;T's president and chief operatingofficer, will serve as acting chairman and is considered thefavorite to succeed Olson.   The century-old ATandamp;T has enough management depth that the lossof Olson is not expected to damage the company. ATandamp;T's stock fell25 cents a share to $26.37{ in consolidated New York Stock Exchangetrading.   Olson died just two days before the company's annual meeting,which is to be held Wednesday in Denver.   ATandamp;T's board of directors already had a meeting scheduled forthis week, but company spokeswoman Lynda Beighley said she couldnot say whether the board would name a chairman at the time.   Olson's deterioration was rapid. The company said the cancer wasdiagnosed after he became ill with flu on March 18. He had surgeryseven days later for removal of a tumor in the colon. He returnedhome on April 1 and had been undergoing chemotherapy as anoutpatient since. He died at home in Short Hills, N.J.   ``All of us in the company are shocked at the suddenness ofJim's death,'' Allen said in a statement. ``He was a dynamic andvisionary leader. We will miss him. Our legacy to him will be thevigor with which we carry out the strategic course he laid out forus during his 20 months as our leader.''   ATandamp;T had been criticized for not making Olson's illness publicuntil news leaked out to the press last week.   The situation was reminiscent of that of William McGowan, thechairman of ATandamp;T's long-distance rival MCI Communications Corp. MCIdid not disclose that McGowan had received a heart transplant untiltwo weeks after the April 1987 operation. McGowan returned tooffice in September.   As recently as the end of last week, ATandamp;T spokesmen were sayingOlson was recuperating. Walter Murphy, a spokesman, said Monday:``That was the best of our knowledge at the time. Everybody here isin shock.''   Under Olson, ATandamp;T cut 27,000 employees, closed some plants andunified parts of the company that had been separated under theconsent decree that broke up the company.   Olson was a blunt but gregarious executive who demanded resultsand saw his own rise through the corporate ranks as an inspirationfor the rest of the company's 303,000 employees.   He landed his first job in the Bell System at age 17, during thesummer of 1943, when he hauled buckets of silt out of telephonemanholes in North Dakota. Disdaining the fashion of boardrooms, hewore short-sleeved shirts throughout his career.   ``I think our employees know, deep down, that I'm one of them,''he said in an interview with a free-lance writer for DeltaAirlines' in-flight magazine, Sky, that has not yet been published.   Olson was 5-feet-10, 175 pounds, jowly and mostly bald withbroad shoulders and muscular forearms. He was not fragile.   ``Jim Olson was the ultimate tough guy. ... I think he instilleda real sense of pride and determination in an ATandamp;T workforce thatat that time needed it,'' said Jack Grubman, an analyst for theinvestment firm PaineWebber Inc.   ``I think he leaves ATandamp;T in good hands,'' Grubman said. ``Ifthis had happened a year ago, it would have been extremelydisruptive.''   Allen is considered to be ATandamp;T's almost certain choice as asuccessor to Olson. Analysts describe him as more soft-spoken thanOlson, a person who favors looking at the big picture.   ``His style is probably more overtly executive (than Olson's),''Grubman said. But the differences do not run too deep, becauseOlson had been grooming Allen as his successor.   Olson, a native of Devils Lake, N.D., was born Dec. 3, 1925. Hisfather was a barber and his mother a teacher.   The same summer that he cleaned manholes in 1943, he got work asa cable splicer's helper with Northwestern Bell Telephone Co. inGrand Forks, N.D.   Twenty-three years later, Olson had moved through the ranks ofthe company to become vice president and general manager in itsIowa area. He was transferred to Indiana Bell as vice president foroperations in 1970 and became president of that company two yearslater.   In 1974, Olson assumed the presidency of Illinois Bell and in1977 became executive vice president of ATandamp;T headquarters in NewYork. He was made president and chief operating officer in June1985 after serving as vice chairman of the board since 1979.   In September 1986, Olson took office as chairman, succeedingCharles L. Brown, who retired.   Olson was a graduate of the University of North Dakota andserved on the boards of many companies, business organizations andcharitable groups. He served 2{ years in the U.S. Army Air Corps.While in college he majored in accounting and completed half thecredits for a law degree.   Olson is survived by his wife, Jean; a son, James D. Olson; adaughter, Mrs. Bruce Paterson; a brother and two sisters.</TEXT></DOC>
