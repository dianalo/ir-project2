There are growing fears that Mr. Collor's government, just18 months old, is nearing paralysis. Efforts to impose shocktherapy to control inflation lack credibility after a historyof six failed attempts in five years. The government'sability to lead is hurt by the absence of a parliamentarymajority. And Mr. Collor's popularity has hit a low point.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;There exists today a strong impression that the countryis misgoverned and that chaos is near,&quot; Social-DemocraticSen. Fernando Henrique Cardoso said recently. &quot;We're like inthe Soviet Union, where everyone knew something wouldhappen,&quot; he told Veja magazine. &quot;Something is going to happenin Brazil.&quot;   Few expect a military coup, but many are bracing forinflationary spurts and social convulsion, fueled partly bythe government's isolation. Many analysts believe Mr.Collor's only way out is to admit the failure of hisgo-it-alone approach and seek to work out some form ofunderstanding with the Brazilian Congress, the businesscommunity, unions and other representative bodies tostabilize the economy.   This could force the flamboyant 42-year-old Mr. Collor toaccept some form of power-sharing, either through a coalitiongovernment or -- in anticipation of a plebiscite planned for1993 on Brazil's system of government -- to switch toparliamentarism from the presidential system.   The feeling of gloom arises largely from the gap betweenMr. Collor's electoral promises and the daily reality ofBrazil. Only one and a half years after he took office, Mr.Collor's pledge to make Brazil a First World country seemshollow. When Mr. Collor left recently for a trip to fourimpoverished African nations, former Planning MinisterAntonio Delfim Netto quipped he was going to &quot;see the futureof Brazil.&quot;   Mr. Collor reached power promising to &quot;kill the tiger ofinflation with one bullet.&quot; Two economic shocks and twoeconomic ministers later, inflation is running at an annualrate of about 350% and rising, despite a recession.   When Mr. Collor took office, inflation was running at 84%a month and corruption had long been rampant. But what makesthe current crisis so dire is that it is happening so earlyin Mr. Collor's term and no quick fixes seem possible.   Tasso Jereissati, president of Brazil's Social-DemocraticParty, calls the situation &quot;the worst crisis in the country'srecent history.&quot; Mr. Jereissati, who met with Mr. Collor lastweek, says he appeared &quot;anguished.&quot;   &quot;Collor's in a corner,&quot; says Andre Lara Resende, vicepresident of banking group Unibanco. &quot;He's used his cards andnothing happened.&quot; Says economist Edmar Bacha: &quot;Since hestill has 3 1/2 years left in his mandate, we have to find asolution with him. We have to be able to create a majoritygovernment with a modern outlook.&quot;   Mr. Collor appears to have gotten the message. He hasinvited top business executives and the leaders of Brazil'sbiggest parties for talks. He has also proposed overhaulingparts of Brazil's all-embracing 1988 constitution thatinhibit the government, including provisions that prevent thegovernment from firing state employees.   Out of all this, some analysts say, could emerge aBrazilian grand bargain: Mr. Collor could get support forconstitutional reform in exchange for rolling over the $57billion that states owe to the federal government. At thesame time, he could seek to get business support by promisingstable rules of the game in return for a truce in pricemarkups. And he could seek an understanding with oppositionparties over a broad program to fight corruption andmodernize the economy while giving the opposition governmentposts.   Even if he can form a coalition or some form of pact, suchan accomplishment wouldn't do much toward resolving Brazil'scrisis. As in Mexico, says Roberto Campos, a leadingpro-free-market deputy, Mr. Collor would have to use such apact to start carrying out genuine reform, including deepcuts in government spending, tax reform, selling off stateenterprises and trade liberalization -- in short, what Mr.Collor promised but never did.   Mr. Collor still has some trump cards. Brazil's relationswith foreign creditors have improved under Economic MinisterMarcilio Marques Moreira, and economists don't rule outagreements in the coming weeks with the InternationalMonetary Fund and creditor banks over Brazil's $122 billionforeign debt, the developing world's largest. At the sametime, after months of delay, Brazil is set to start itsprivatization program this month by floating steelmakerUsiminas. While he warns that Brazil is in a state of&quot;repressed hyperinflation,&quot; Mr. Bacha says a successfuloutcome on these fronts would help reverse inflationaryexpectations.   &quot;After seeing what happened in the Soviet Union, why notbelieve that Santa Claus will come in September?&quot; Mr. Bachaasks.   &quot;The destiny of Collor's government will be decided in thenext 60 days,&quot; says former Central Bank President CarlosLangoni. &quot;This could be his second, but possibly also hislast, chance. If he fails to get political support, inflationwill worsen, we'll have another shock and we'll go fromcrisis to crisis.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
