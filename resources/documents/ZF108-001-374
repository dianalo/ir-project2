 The system they sent me is the 286 with 1.6MB of RAM, a20 MB hard disk, and the 2400 baud modem installed.andP;  Compaq also sent me asecond battery, a mobile power supply (12 volts) and a 5-1/4 inch externalhard disk.andP;  The system, as shipped, has a list price of $5986.00.andP;  Somewhatpricey but for a fully functional, under 7 pound unit, with no competition atthe moment, it is worth it.andM;I used LapLink III to load my applications and files onto the hard disk.andO;Traveling Software really has it all together.andP;  I used my AST 386 system onmy desk to first move LapLink III over to the Compaq and then moved the filesI wanted to have with me on the road.andP;  It took no time at all.andP;  The onlyproblem I had was trying to decide what beta software I would take with me.andO;I soon found that having a twenty megabyte disk is great, but after havinggotten used to having 60 or more megabytes for storage, I had to be somewhatjudicious in my choice of applications.andM;Compaq shipped the unit loaded with Compaq DOS 3.3 and later I received DOS4.01 and OS/2.andP;  I have chosen to use DOS 3.3 for now and not bother toinstall either of the other two operating systems.andP;  The unit now has Mirror,my communications program, XYWrite III, IBM's new PIM, Current, Excel,DESQview, Xerox's Formbase, XTree Professional, Disk Director (see below),Borland's Sidekick and Advantage to run data over to my Selectronics DataStor 8000 (see below), Money Matters by Great American Software, and a slewof utilities.andP;  All in all, I managed to fill up over 15 MB of the 20available!andM;Anyway, I am now in a position to not only do the work I need to get done onthis trip (including this column), but also to experiment with some of theprograms I keep meaning to learn better.andP;  Current for example, is a verypowerful PIM (see last month) and I really like it.andP;  However, I have alreadydiscovered several things that I do not like about using Windows on a laptopthat is not equipped with a mouse.andP;  First, of course, one has to find theproper keystrokes to move to the menu bar and navigate around the Windowsshell.andP;  Secondly, once I get into Current or Excel I have a problem againwith the keystrokes to make the applications work.andP;  I can find my way aroundwithout a manual, but it is both time consuming and really a pain in the neckto be productive without a pointing device of some type.andM;Next, I tried out the modem and the modem program in order to make sure thatit worked properly.andP;  Once again, I had to get into the program files one at atime and tell the computer that it is really looking for COM2 and not COM1 ason my desktop machine.andP;  I guess one way around this is to just set up all ofmy machines to recognize a modem as COM2, since every laptop I have uses thatport and reserves port 1 for a standard serial device.andP;  Once I made thatchange, the modem came up and worked the first time I tried it.andP;  The screen,however, needed to be modified for CGA graphics.andP;  This is true with severalof the applications I loaded onto the system.andP;  There were no surprises here,just the realization that if you decide to move applications between systemswith different hardware, CPU's, and screens, they need to be set up tooperate in the new mode.andP;  Windows requires you to go back into the set-upprogram.andP;  DESQview, Mirror, and several others I have permit me to make thechanges within the program instead.andM;While I am on the subject of Windows, I really am wasting space on this diskthis trip.andP;  I could not find a copy of Windows 286 from Microsoft and so hadto load FormBase, Current, and Excel with their own run-time Windows versionin order to make them work.andP;  I really hope that this type of thing getschanged in the future.andP;  After all, Microsoft and IBM have both promised usthat one real advantage to Windows is to install all of the print drivers,fonts, and other I/O drivers into it and not have to worry about theapplications since they will all direct their output through Windows.andP;  Istill have problems with different programs working under Windows and amlooking forward to the rumored new release of this product in order to getsome relief from all of the fiddling I am having to do.andM;Back to the Compaq.andP;  I have now written all of the above text using it whilesitting in a coach seat on an American Airlines 767.andP;  It fits well on thetray table, the screen is bright and easy to read even with my light turnedout.andP;  If the seat in front of me is reclined I can still see the screen andget to the system without any problems.andP;  When I first tried the unit sittingon my desk, I was concerned about the lack of keyboard angle.andP;  Since I havebeen using it on the tray table, I do not find this to be a problem.andP;  I couldalways support the back of the unit with a book or even the spare battery,but so far the lack of angle (incline) is not a problem.andM;I have just gotten back to this column after putting the Compaq in standbyfor about 20 minutes while eating dinner and then playing with Disk Director(Athena Software, 4915 Twin Lakes Road, Suite 19, Boulder, CO 80301,303-666-9569) and Money Matters, which is built on One-Write Plus (GreatAmerican Software, Inc., 615 Amherst Street, Nashua, NY 03063; 603-889-5400).andO;Both of these programs are really neat.andP;  Disk Director is a fully functionalhard disk management program which permits you to move, copy, delete, viewand otherwise manage data on any disk, but specifically on a hard disk.andP;  Themain view has a directory tree structure on the right-hand portion of thescreen and a listing of files on the left-hand side.andP;  What I have done so faris to delete entire directories and move other sub-directories to newlocations.andM;After I had installed the shrink-wrapped version of IBM's Current, I realizedthat I still had the beta version on the system in a sub-directory calledCURRENTS (IBM changed the name dropping the &quot;s&quot;.andP;  So I brought up DiskDirector and deleted the CURRENTS directory, complete with allsub-directories and files.andP;  It took only two commands to do this.andP;  First Imoved the pointer to select the directory and then I told the program todelete the directory and all of the files in it.andP;  Once this was done, I satand watched as the program took care of my request.andP;  The next thing I did wasto move the sub-directory CURRENT and all of the sub-directories under it(and the files) under the directory named WINDOWS.andP;  To accomplish this, all Ihad to do was to select the directory CURRENT and then use a pull-down menuto tell the program that I wanted to move it and all of its associated filesand directories.andP;  Once the directories were high-lighted I merely used thecursor keys to &quot;drag&quot; all of them to the new location I wanted and press theenter key.andP;  Once this was done, the program did the rest and within a fewminutes the directory containing CURRENT was moved under the directory calledWINDOWS on my system.andM;There is only one drawback that I have found to this program.andP;  If you have aBatch file or some other menu system to get you into your applications, youhave to modify it after you have moved the directories.andP;  However, if you arecareful you will not create a problem.andP;  Adding a new sub-directory is as easyas pulling down a menu and telling the machine what you want to call it andwhere you want to put it.andP;  I have now used this program to move most of myprograms and files around on the hard disk.andP;  With the visual indication ofwhere everything is, it is a simple matter to rearrange directories into amore logical rearrange directories into a more logical form.andP;  Although Iconfused the heck out of DESQview which needed to be told what new paths touse.andP;  Once I accomplished this task, I had a disk which was much morelogically arranged and on which I can now find things easier.andP;  I have noteven scratched the surface of this handy utility's capabilities.andP;  However, Ireally like it.andP;  I am accustomed to using XtreePRO which I still like.andO;However being able to move things around on the screen and then have theprogram move all of the files attached and the sub-directories associatedwith them is great.andM;Money MattersandM;Every year I go through the same process.andP;  In December I look at all of thehome and small business accounting packages which are on the market and tryand find one that I want to use for the upcoming year.andP;  I pick this time ofyear for a very good reason.andP;  January is the easiest time of the year tostart a new accounting package.andP;  Any other time of the year requires me toreenter all of my checks and deposits.andP;  When I start the year in January, Ican pick the one program I want to use and stick with it all year long.andP;  Lastyear I did everything on MacMoney (company) and enjoyed using it.andP;  However,there are still some things that it will not let me do.andP;  For example, Icannot print out a copy of my monthly budget, I cannot set it up toautomatically split my mortgage payment between principle and interest, and Icannot get fancy and have it record the impounds (sequestered funds) that Ialso pay with my mortgage.andM;This year I am searching for a fully functional accounting program not onlyfor my own finances, but also to be used in running the &quot;small&quot; business thatmakes up the consulting and book royalty portion of my income.andP;  I am alsolooking for both a Macintosh and IBM-PC program which can be used by somefriends of mine who want to start a business setting up accounting systemsfor small businesses in the area.andM;Money Matters seems to be a very powerful program and very easy to use.andO;Before I left on my trip, I loaded the program on my hard disk to try when Ihad the time.andP;  I forgot the manuals (naturally) and so had to be content withwhat I could glean from the menus and help files provided with the program.andO;So far, without using a single book, I have been able to set up my chart ofaccounts and enter the starting balances for each of the categories.andP;  Lateron this trip I will be entering data to see exactly how it works.andP;  However, Iam VERY impressed so far.andP;  I now have a complete chart of accounts set-up formy personal as well as business finances.andP;  Further, I have been able to enterstarting balances without any problems, and have gotten to the point of beingready to enter &quot;real&quot; balances inside of an hour.andP;  I do not yet know how ithandles things like mortgage interest, but I will find out on this trip andwill probably add to this column on the way home.andM;Actually, I have not really had enough time to finish learning the programbut I am still impressed with its function.andP;  I am always hesitant whendiscussing accounting packages since I am not, nor do I want to be, anaccountant and still always have trouble with debits and credits.andP;  However, Ido know what I WANT when it comes to handling my home finances (I leave the&quot;real&quot; business accounting up to the folks who are paid to understand all ofit.andP;  They are presently looking at some of the accounting software which wehave received in-house and I will be providing you with their findings infuture columns.).andP;  It does not seem unreasonable to me that a home accountingpackage should function just as a person does when trying to figure out whatbills are due and how much money is in the bank to pay them.andP;  So far, what Ireally rely on is an Excel spreadhseet which I have built and use everymonth.andP;  I used Excel because I can link spreadhseets and have linked eachmonths ending balances to the next months starting balances.andM;For any of you who might be interested, this is really not a very complexspreadsheet.andP;  My column headings are: Date due, To Whom, Last Month'sbalance, last month's payments, this month's charges, interest, new balance,minimum payment due, suggested payment.andP;  This is a item I have been using totry and minimize credit card interest.andP;  It combines the minimum payment dueplus the current month's interest into a recommended payment.andP;  Amount paid,date and check number of payment, ending balance (this is the column which iscarried forward to the starting balance for the next month), credit limit(for credit cards), and credit available.andP;  I won't bore you with theformulas.andP;  If you have any interest at all, lay out the headings on aspreadsheet and the formulas will becomes self-evident.andM;Recently I have added a new macro which causes the date due to be replacedwith the word &quot;Paid&quot; when I enter an amount in the paid column.andP;  I also trackmy total monthly payments as totals with one for all payments and one brokenout for &quot;normal&quot; monthly expenses and one for &quot;other.&quot;andP;  One of the advantagesI have found to this type of spreadsheet is that if I have any money leftover at the end of a month (fat chance but I can dream, can't I), I then jumpdown to another section of the spreadsheet in which I look at the balance dueon each credit card vs.andP;  the monthly payment vs.andP;  the interest being charged.andO;A few simple formulas and I know exactly where to send this &quot;extra money&quot;either to minimize my monthly payments or to minimize my interest payments.andM;This is a long way around saying that what I really want in a home accountingpackage is more than just a check book entry system, and even more thanManaging your Money by Andrew Tobias.andP;  In his program he permits you to trackyour assets and liabilities, figures loans and pay-offs, and lets you run anumber of check books easily, but he does nothing to help you track monthlyexpenses other than to help you generate a budget and compare it to actuals.andO;I don't know about you, but I need help in tracking who needs to be paid whenand how much.andP;  My bills come in over the course of the month, but I only sitdown to pay them twice a month (because I only get paid twice a month).andM;Budgets might help me in the second and third years of a program -- the firstyear I &quot;guess-timate&quot; what my electric bill should be, etc., but that is notmy problem.andP;  I KNOW that i spend more than I make each month.andP;  What I need tomake sure of is that everyone who needs to get paid by a certain date getshis check.andP;  I also need to know how things look relative to credit debt vs.andO;cash in the bank.andP;  For example, after a few months of using this spreadsheet,I discovered that one of my credit cards was far worse about interest and theway it was calculated than any of the others.andP;  What was happening in simpleterms was that I was making a required minimum payment of $25.00 each monthand the interest being charged on the unpaid balance was 24.56!andP;  At that rateI would never have gotten it paid off or even to a point where I was makingany progress on it.andP;  After looking at it for a few months and seeing what washappening, I diverted more cash to that account to pay it off and get rid ofit, not only lowering my monthly payments but also saving myself a heftyinterest charge for the year.andM;The other thing I have discovered after taking the time to track my expensesis that some credit card companies seem to be playing some type of a game.andO;If any one of our readers understands what I am about to mention, please callme and tell me that I am not crazy.andP;  Here is what happens: I get a bill fromXYZ saying that my previous balance was $250.00, my payment was $25.00, mycharges for the month were $50.00, and the interest charged was $5.00, so mynew balance is (the way I figure it and the way they show it) 250 minus 25plus 50 plus 5 ($250-$25+$50+$5) for a total of: $280.andP;  So my minimum paymentis now $30.00.andP;  OK, so I pay the $30.00 which should reduce the balance andbe reflected in the next month's statement.andP;  Great, except that when the nextmonth's statement comes, instead of showing a starting balance of $280 (asabove) it is now $284.00.andP;  I've already told you that I am not an accountantbut I still cannot figure this one out....any ideas out there?andM;Anyway, my opinion is that Money Matters is a very powerful, yet easy to use,program that deserves your consideration if you're looking for home and/orsmall business accounting software.andM;Networks and suppliersandM;If you are like us when you install a network, there are many differentpieces and parts of equipment that you would like to have but cannot find atthe local computer store.andP;  Eagle Electronics (1233 E. Colorado St, Glendale,CA 91205, 1-800-992-3191) has a catalog which is filled with hard to find andvery handy network products.andP;  They carry a full line of wall plates, wire andcables, modular panels, cable connectors, transceivers, tools, modems andmore.andP;  Their prices seem reasonable and they provide a nice description ofeach product in the catalog.andP;  I find that having the catalog around as areference source is helpful and when planning a network for a consultingclient, I can easily find exactly what I need.andM;PC PilotandM;Every single person who has ever sat down in front of a computer has playedwith one or more flight simulator programs over the years.andP;  My son who is inthe Air Force, has been performing tests on a number of different packagesfor us (just for fun) and came across a new publication called PC Pilot (2170Broadway, Suite 2165, New York, NY 10024, 212-796-5534) which is devoted tothe more than two million PC Pilots they claim are floating around in theworld of computers.andP;  This monthly publication deals with the whole range anddepth of computer flying, on all computers, in all formats.andP;  Standing columnsinclude Techniques, and Tactics, both of which are authored by leadingexperts in the flight simulation field.andP;  The publication has been inexistence since September 1989 .A 12-issue subscription is $30.00.andM;ASOPC now on CD-ROMandM;For all of you CD-ROM fans, you can now get every issue of this newsletterplus a lot more on a monthly CD-ROM put out by Ziff Communications Company.andO;These disks contain many of the computer industry's publications and nowinclude not only this newsletter but those published by Jonathan Seybold,Patricia Seybold, Stuart Alsop, Esther Dyson, Jeff Tarter, and others.andP;  Inaddition to the publications featured, Ziff also provides abstracts of 10additional publications as well as the Computer Glossary by Alan Freedmancontaining over 3500 in-depth definitions of computer industry terms andhistorical profiles of major software and hardware companies.andP;  Informationcan be obtained by calling Toni Nevitt of Ziff Communications Company (212)503-4423.andM;Traveling ComputersandM;Traveling Software is best known for its LapLink products for both the PC andthe Macintosh (18702 North Creek Parkway, Bothell, WA98011, 206-483-8088).andO;However, they also have a catalog division which sells almost anything youcould want for a laptop or handheld computer.andP;  Traveling Software hasrecently formed a new company to handle this catalog.andP;  Called Travel Tech andlocated in Bothell, Washington (1-800-343-8080), this company's new catalogis a must for anyone using laptops or planning to in the future.andP;  Of coursethey list their own products but they also have found many suppliers ofpieces and parts designed to make laptop computing easier.andP;  For example, theyfeature a full line of carrying cases, add-in and add-on modems, fax systems,scanners, and other items.andP;  The catalog, for years, was the one place to goto find add-on products for the Tandy laptops and now it has been expanded tocover virtually every aspect of traveling with computers.andM;NEC and the UltraLiteandM;NEC finally has announced a removable battery for the UltraLite computer.andP;  Weall knew that it was coming but did not know when or even how much it wouldcost.andP;  Well the mystery is now solved.andP;  The new removable battery whichprovides up to two hours on a charge sells for $119 each.andP;  Owners of existingUltraLites can have their unit converted to a removable battery version for$59, including all parts and labor.andP;  The service for retrofit began onDecember 1st and is available at any NEC service center.andM;You might recall that in my review of the UltraLite I complained about boththe battery being non-removable and the recharge time.andP;  It is not clear to meif they have made any improvements in the recharge time area, but havingspare batteries available should at least cure one of the major problems withthis machine.andP;  I hope to be able to exchange my UltraLite unit for one of thenewer ones and provide a more detailed review of the new battery system in anupcoming issue.andM;Project Notify, Inc.andM;During the recent earthquake(s) in the San Jose-San Francisco area, one ofthe main means of emergency communications was via amateur radio.andP;  Many of ustraveled to the Santa Cruz area and provided communications to unload some ofthe traffic being handled by the local police and fire channels.andP;  The amateurradio operators were, in fact, the only communications link between San Joseand Santa Cruz for four days after the quake.andP;  I spent the night of the earthquake running an amateur radio station from the California Department ofForestry station in Felton, Ca.andP;  and then for several days there after.andP;  Wehandled emergency traffic for the fire, police, and Red Cross operationswhich were providing help and assistance.andM;We received hundreds of requests to handle traffic into and out of the areawhich were non-emergency in nature but were considered as &quot;health andwelfare&quot; messages.andP;  These we were not able to handle on the voicecommunications channels but rather referred them to the packet radio systemin operation at the time.andP;  For any of you who might not be familiar with theamateur radio packet radio network, it is very extensive and handles digitalcommunications messages all over the world.andP;  For the past few months we havehad a LAN server set-up in the office.andP;  This system, using an AST 386computer and running under Quarterdeck's DESQview, uses three different radiochannels to pass traffic from our area to several other LAN's in NorthernCalifornia and to the rest of the country and the world.andP;  Our system, runningunder my amateur radio call sign (W8GEC) is a hub for the many Bulletin BoardSystems in operation in the San Jose area.andP;  In effect we provide the &quot;server&quot;for all of the BBS systems in the area and forward traffic to the Santa Cruzsystem, the San Francisco system and through these to the rest of the world.andM;On a typical day we handle between 50 and 100 messages.andP;  These are usually&quot;ham to ham&quot; type communications and the forwarding system is verysophisticated.andP;  We use zip code tables as well as amateur radio call areas inorder to send the traffic to the station nearest its destination.andP;  During theearthquake our system was up and running the entire time and our traffic loadwent up to over 500 messages per day!andM;Most of these were inquiries from other parts of the country as to the healthand welfare of loved ones, family, and friends.andP;  All of these were handled atno charge to the people requesting the information, and most of them wereanswered within a 24 hour period.andM;However, after the earthquake crunch it became obvious that not enough peopleknew how to access this network.andP;  Recently a non-profit organization has beenformed to try and provide some of the same type of service using the existingnationwide bulletin board systems such as Compuserve, MCI, the Source andothers.andP;  The organization is called Project Notify, Inc. and can be reachedat Box 8656, Incline Village, NV 89450.andP;  This organization is looking forcash and equipment donations and has the blessing of many different relieforganizations.andM;Our plan is to harness the nationwide networks and then dump the requestsinto the amateur radio packet network as well as into the normal disasterrelief channels.andP;  If you would like more information or are willing to assistas either a contributor or as a volunteer, contact Project Notify at theaddress above.andM;Note: for any of you who might not be familiar with the telephone companies'disaster plans here are a few basics.andP;  After a major disaster, all incomingtelephone traffic is halted and all phone lines are disabled.andP;  The phonecompany then starts to re-instate service on a priority basis.andP;  The firstpriority is public safety and government agencies, next (and this isimportant to know) is all pay telephones in the affected area, and finallybusiness and residential phone service.andP;  If you are in a disaster area youmay be able to get contact outside of the area by going to the nearest paytelephones rather than trying to place a call from your own business orresidential phone.andM;Software PublishersandM;AssociationandM;As many of you may be aware, the SPA has started a program to get its membersto offer amnesty to users of illegal copies of software.andP;  Several companieshave taken up this plea and have had a lot of success with it.andP;  If you havean illegal copy of software, find out if the company is offering such aprogram and contact them to turn your copy into a legitimate one.andM;The SPA also tracks software sales as best they can, not only in the UnitedStates but also in the entire world market.andP;  On November 20th they announcedthat software sales were up 10% in the third quarter as compared to the thirdquarter of 1988, and internationally up 25%.andP;  The fastest growing areas werespreadsheets, up 39%, Macintosh up 19%, DOS sales up 11.2% and DOSrecreational software grew 9.1%.andP;  This brings the total North American marketsales to $779.5 million dollars for the third quarter, a very healthy figure.andM;Xerox tries againandM;Xerox has been stumbling around with one of the best desktop publishingproducts on the DOS market in Ventura, for a number of years.andP;  On November15th they announced three new versions of Ventura: a new DOS version, aWindows version, and an OS/2 version.andP;  In addition, they have combined theproduct into a single SKU, leaving the Professional Extensions and the LANversion concept.andM;The DOS edition which sells for $895 now includes all of the ProfessionalExtensions, and the LAN pack.andP;  It still runs under the GEM user interface,and existing users can upgrade at a price to be determined.andM;The Windows and OS/2 versions will also sell for $895.andP;  but existing users ofDOS version 2.0 can purchase either new package for $395.andP;  Both the Windowsand OS/2 versions have been rewritten to take full advantage of the new userinterfaces, and both versions permit operation between Ventura and otherapplications written for the same environment.andM;My flight finally ended at Kennedy Airport in New York.andP;  I was into my secondbattery but had enough power left over to send the files off via MCI to oureditor so that she could start working on them even before I finished thiscolumn.andP;  This is one of those trips when nothing appeared to go right.andO;Arriving at my hotel room I found that I had forgotten my three prong ACadapter and every AC outlet in the room was a 2 wire one.andP;  I finally found aplace to plug in the laptop, however, in the bathroom in a three prong plugabove the sink.andP;  It wasn't exactly the type of hook-up I'd prefer.andP;  I had toleave the bathroom light on all night, but I did get my batteries recharged.andO;I also managed to jury rig the telephone so that I could send the filesbefore retiring for the night.andM;Telephones and HotelsandM;In addition to writing my comments about hotels in The Outlook, I wrote aboutit last month in my MIS Week column.andP;  I talked about my frustrations and gavethe example of a fellow journalist who finally found a way to transmit hiscolumn back to his office.andP;  In his hotel room he had two phones, the one bythe bed was hardwired and could not be taken apart.andP;  The one in the bathroomwas an answer only phone (no dial-and I hate phones in there anyway), but itdid come apart so that he could use his clip leads and access the telephonewires.andM;What he ended up having to do was to set up the laptop in his bathroom,connect his jumpers to the phone there (being careful not to let the phonefall into the toilet), go to the phone by the bed and dial the access codefor a long distance call (8), run into the bathroom and have the computerdial the balance of the number.andP;  It is a good thing that he is getting paidlots of money for his column, otherwise, in the same position, I would havebeen inclined to pass on getting a story into the editors on time.andM;Anyway, as a result of the column and my publishing our BBS telephone number,we have picked up a large number of new users on the system who are not onlybrowsing the BBS data on hotels but are also adding to it.andP;  If you have notchecked in yet please feel free to do so, there is no charge other than thecost to you for the long distance call.andP;  We are starting to add sharewarefiles to the system as well as the hotel data base.andP;  Several subscribers andI have been having some very good discussions on this system sharinginformation and discussing the industry as a whole.andM;Time: 15:10 EST, location, 39,000 feet, direction of travel: West, purpose oftravel: to go home and leave the snow and the cold to the Easterners.andM;I am now sitting in first class on an American Airlines plane on the way backto San Jose.andP;  There is no trick to using the Compaq laptop on the tray tablefurnished in first class (upgrades are so nice), since they pull out of thearmrest and the seat in front of you is about three feet beyond that.andO;However, if a laptop were more than 12 inches deep it would have to bebalanced on the tray table which is just 12 inches deep itself.andP;  The onlyproblem I have found with the Compaq computer in first class is thestewardess wanted to put a table cloth on my tray table and cover up thecomputer!andM;Seriously, the more I use the Compaq LTE the more I like it.andP;  I have onlydiscovered one little quirk with it and I have not yet determined if it isthe machine or my word processing program.andP;  When I am really typing quickly Icannot always capitalize the first word of a new sentence.andP;  I type away andget to the first word, hit the shift key and the letter and most of the timethe letter stays in lower case.andP;  Now, either my word processor is not pickingup the shift quickly enough (XYWrite III+), or I am having cockpit errorswith the Compaq keyboard, or it just does not like to have people type on ittoo quickly.andM;In spite of this problem I am really falling for this machine.andP;  I wish Icould use the memory more effectively but still this is just about thecomputer I have really been waiting for.andP;  It has all of the power andfunction I really want (although I would opt for the 40 MB hard drive).andP;  Thescreen is very good even though it is CGA, and it is probably one of thebrightest and easiest to read screens I have had the chance to view in alaptop.andP;  The keyboard, except for the problem noted above, is very good, thetactile feel is great, it generates a little key-click noise which I happento like but which may bother your seat-mate on an airplane, and the batterieslast longer than advertised and recharge perfectly.andP;  If I have one suggestionfor Compaq it is to furnish some type of writing surface on the battery.andO;They are plain black with no place to write a date, or &quot;battery 1&quot; etc.andO;Several times I have only had time to recharge one of the two and wanted tohave the charger work with the one which was in the lowest charge conditionbut got confused as to which battery was which.andP;  If I could just make a noteon the battery with a pen each time I took it out of the computer I couldkeep track of it better.andP;  However, my hat is really off to Compaq.andP;  This is,by far, the nicest fully functional computer I have used!andM;A note to Bill GatesandM;Bill: Now that we have four different types of disk drives 5-1/4 - 360K and1.2MB, 3.5 inch - 720K and 1.44MB how about making some changes to the DOSformat command?andP;  How come I have to remember to type Format A:/4 in order toformat a 5-1/4 inch disk as 360K on a 1.20 MB drive and how come I have totype format b:xx/xx/xx in order to get my 3.5 inch disk to format in 720K?andO;While I am on the subject why can I not reformat either a 1.2 MB disk to 360Kor a 1.44 MB disk to a 720K without having to bulk erase them?andP;  It would seemto me that it would be easy enough to ask a person (user) which format hewanted and then just go out and format the disk.andP;  Part of the supportproblems PC gurus are having, in corporate America, deal with formattingdisks and the sharing of disks in the wrong format.andP;  This should be a veryeasy fix for DOS, how about it?andM;While you are at it, fix the same problems in Windows and OS/2.andP;  It would bevery helpful to people who are not computerists and who do not want to haveto look this stuff up on the DOS manual (which is not real clear when itcomes to formatting disks other than the maximum the drive supports).andP;  Whycan't you go out and look at the disk and tell the user what it can beformatted as.andP;  For example if I insert a disk capable of 1.2 MB format in my5-1/4 drive why can't you go out and check it and then ask me if I want toformat it as a 1.44MB disk or as a 360K disk?andM;Also, since I am asking you to make changes to DOS, how about making thechanges that Compaq has to your hard disk formatting routine.andP;  I know fromtalking to the folks at Compaq that they have to send you the code and thatyou already have the ability to make these changes.andP;  Wouldn't it be easy toprovide a &quot;smart&quot; installation routine which finds out what your hard disk isand makes recommendations?andP;  Wouldn't it be easy to make some suggestions tousers about how to configure their disks and then do it for them?andM;If DOS is going to be around for as long as you say it is then why not&quot;humanize&quot; it some more?andP;  the above ideas are only two of the manysuggestions I have and would be happy to share with you.andP;  I known that youare in a bind supporting DOS, Windows, and OS/2 and you have to be able toprovide products which are different, but you still could add some of these&quot;ease of use&quot; features to DOS without impacting your other operating systems.andM;Xerox wakes upandM;You may remember that some time ago I commented on the Apple-Microsoft suit.andO;I wondered out loud why Xerox was not going after Apple in the same way Applewas going after Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard et al.andP;  Well, just as I wasfinishing up this column the story broke in the news that Xerox is suingApple for 150 million because of Apple's use of ICONs first developed byXerox for its Star Computer.andP;  Apple, of course, has responded with thestatement that you cannot copyright ideas, but it is nice to see Xerox getinto the battle.andP;  I always felt that Apple had a lot of nerve to sue anybodyfor using an interface that was not its idea in the first place.andP;  I am notgoing to get into the issues of ownership, copyrights and that sort of thingsince I am not an expert by anybody's standards.andP;  However, my reaction to theApple suit was one of &quot;how could they have the guts to do that?&quot;.andM;I am pleased to see Xerox involved.andP;  What is right is right.andP;  While none ofus (users) will benefit from this battle of the attorneys, I must say that Iam pleased that Xerox is interested enough in what they developed at XeroxPARC to enter into the fray.andP;  It will be interesting to see what happens.andM;Holiday SeasonandM;Any of you who have been subscribers to any of the Seybold Publications forany time know that my father (John) and my sister Patricia, and even mybrother Jonathan, have taken to poetry at this time of year.andP;  The game is tomention in rhyme as many vendors, clients, and subscribers as possible andprovide a holiday message for all.andP;  I guess that part of my father's geniusdid not find its way into my brain.andP;  If I sit down and try to rhyme mythoughts they come out like something written by a junior high student whohas to compose a poem in English class or fail for the year.andP;  It's verydifficult for me to single out a few vendors, clients and subscribers (andthe ones I might want to use don't rhyme with anything!).andP;  So, from thisSeybold, at least, you'll get no rhymes, nor any prose that talks aboutpeople in the industry at this time of year.andM;What you will get is a very warm and sincere wish for you and your loved onesto have a happy and healthy holiday season and a hope that 1990 will prove tobe another great year for all of you.andP;  What you will also get is a sincere&quot;thank you&quot; for all of your support during this past year.andP;  We have not beenable to accomplish all we set out to do, we were not able to pull off ourOld-timers party, nor were we able to get our Desktop Connectivity Conferenceback on track.andP;  We weren't able to write about as many products, people anddevelopments as deserved to be covered.andM;We were, however, able to survive as a truly independent newsletter andconsulting operation.andP;  We were able to take part in many industry events andwe were able to talk to or meet some of you.andP;  We have tried to listen to yourcomments (both good and bad) and we have tried to remake the newsletter intosomething which is both of value to you and which meets our expectations.andM;1989 has been a very full year for us.andP;  It has been full of great events inthe industry, of good times for us, and of disappointments.andP;  But it has onlybeen a year since we regained our independence and we have not lost faith.andO;We are not where we want to be yet, but we are moving in that direction andtruly appreciate all of your support, suggestions and comments.andM;The next time I sit down to write this column it will be 1990, the start of anew decade, and yet another year in the world of the computer.andP;  It too, like1989, will be filled with accomplishments, disappointments, and some productintroductions which we cannot even visualize at the moment.andP;  It will be fun,it will be hard work, and it will mark another year in the which we getcloser to our industry goal of providing products which solve problems.andM;So, if you were looking for rhymes or expected to see your company name (oryours) in a poem, you've chosen the wrong Seybold Publication to read.andO;However, I trust this is the correct one for your interests and yourinformation needs.andP;  We are listening to your input and it is valuable to us.andO;I hope to hear from each and every one of you during 1990.andP;  Have a happy,safe and prosperous holiday and New Year.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
