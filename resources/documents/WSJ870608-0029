It is not right to put too much pressure on the exchange rate.&quot;    Mr. Chang was responding to recent reports that U.S. officials, seeking to reduce the two nations' trade imbalance, had told Taiwan its currency hadn't risen enough against the U.S. dollar. The Taiwan dollar traded at 31.30 to the U.S. dollar Friday. It has climbed about 11% against the U.S. currency this year and 21% since January 1986. A higher currency tends to make Taiwan's products more expensive and less competitive overseas.    Taiwan's trade surplus with the U.S. was $4.99 billion in the first four months of 1987, a 29% increase from a year earlier. For all of 1986, it had a $13.57 billion surplus in trade with the U.S.    Mr. Chang said he expects the growth of the surplus to slow in the second half of this year. &quot;We will buy more from the U.S.,&quot; he said, as the rising Taiwan dollar has enhanced local companies' buying ability. </TEXT></DOC>
