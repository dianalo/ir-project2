Mr. President, last March 31 the New York Times carried afront page story headlined: ``Competition for Contracts Trims PentagonCosts.'' The story quoted the Deputy Under<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> S<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ecretary of Defense for Procurement as saying: ``Nothinghas driven down prices a<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> much as competition.'' When I read that story Iasked Richard Kaufman, the <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>c<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ounsel for the Congressional Joint Economic Committeeand a longtime expert on defense procurement, to analyze the significanceof this Pentagon claim. After all, here was an administration that hadannounced a vigorous campaign to increase efficiency and reduce defenseprocurement costs when it took office. How did competition rate as a toolfor achieving this end at that time? The new team at the Department ofDefense listed 31 policies it intended to press to achieve its lower costaim. Where did competition rank? The answer is that competition literallyranked nowhere. The Defense Department could not find a place in its almostendless list of greater efficiency policies for competition. When thisSenator pointed this out and complained about it, the Defense Departmentadded a 32d category, to wit_increased competition.Of course, this was no surprise. Competition and the Defense Departmentgo together about the way a typical 6-year-old boy and taking a bath gotogether. Th<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ey<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> don't. DOD has had to be pushed, pulled, spanked,kicking and screaming into competition. This has been true under all administrations_Democraticand Republican. There is in DOD an overpowering tendency to reward oldfamiliar friends of Pentagon officials with Defense contracts. After allthe experts who are brought into the Pentagon to manage procurement comeoverwhelmingly from the defense industry. These experts are said to havethe unique, practical experience in building the tanks and planes and shipsand mis<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>si<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>les the Defense Department must have. Some do haveexpertise. Some do not. But they almost all have that strong defense industryconnection. Similarly when the corporations that produce the multibilliondollar weapons systems the Defense Department procures are looking forthe best qualified salesmen where do they look? If the Defense contractorsare realists there is only one place to look. Where is that? That is fromamong the current or very recent procurement officials at the Defense Departmentitself. Competition based on vigorously solicited formally advertised biddingrudely interrupts the chummy relationships between DOD procurement officialsand their past or prospective employing corporations.With this in mind, consider what Richard Kaufman, the Joint Economic Committeeprocurement expert, discovered in the investigation I requested of theNew York Times story on the Defense Department's present romance with competition.In 1984 the Congress enacted the ``Competition in Contracting'' Act. Isit working? Yes and <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>n<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>o. Since then the DOD has increased what they call``competition'' significantly. That is, contracts awarded competitively,under the terms of the new law, increased in numbers and in dollar valuein proportion to overall procurement.If this is so why is my answer to whether competition is increasing atthe Pentagon ``yes and no'' instead of just ``yes''? Answer: competitionis defined by the act to include negotiated contracts where two or morebids are received, as well as what used to be called ``formally advertised,''and is now referred to as ``sealed bids.'' In this Senator's book formallyadvertised bidding or ``sealed bids'' represents a policy much closer toeffective competition than contracts where only two or three firms bid.So what has been the record on formal advertising or sealed bids? The answer:not good. Only a very small percentage of contracts are awarded throughsealed bids. In the early 1960's, only about 12 percent of total procurementwas formally advertised. Now it is worse. Only a<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>bo<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ut 5 or 6 percent of <ITAG tagnum="80">procurement is through what this Senator would call real competition.</ITAG>There is also the matter of the accuracy and completeness of DOD's statistics.Is the Pentagon cooking the boo<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ks<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>? In 1982, the General Accounting Office questionedthe way DOD was reporting the facts about competition, and the way thebase was being changed from one period to another. GAO said then, ``Inour opinion, DOD's presentation of, and changes to, its statistics coulddecrease the credibility of the statistics and could even lead to a realdecline in competition.'' DOD's presentation of the facts is still verymuch in question. This puts a different spin on the formally released DOD figures that showcompetition has increased from 42.9 percent in 1984 to 57.2 percent in1986. There is the appearance of increased competition partly because thelaw now requires it and partly because DOD is presenting the figures ina misleading way. So yes competition for defense procurement ma<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>y<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> have increased since the passage of the 1984 <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ct requiring more competition. But not by as muchas is claimed by the DOD. There is still a very long way to go. Last yearthe General Accounting Office reported on the effects of the Competitionin Contracting Act. It confirmed the fact that what the law now calls competitionhas increased. It criticized, however, DOD's manipulation of the data andthe lack of compliance in some areas. To be specific, DOD excludes a large part of its procurements which arenot subject to competition. This shrinks the base and exaggerates the proportionof competitive awards. Other changes in the statistics suggest the currentfigures are not comparable with earlier figures. The improvement since1984 in Defense <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>p<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>rocurement has certainly been overstated and comparisonswith the years before 1984 may not now be possible. How does DOD classifya procu<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>re<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ment in which only one contractor submits a proposal?This Senator would say that contract was not competitive. But that's notthe way DOD clas<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ifies it. A contractor competing only with himselfbecause only he submitted a proposal is considered by the Pentagon to havewon a competitive bid. Some competition!GAO found cases where DOD rigged the solicitation by restricting it toa product made by only one manufacturer. Yet DOD considered the awardsto have been made competitively. In all fairness there is one indicator that defense contracting is morecompetitive than it used to be. The Defense contractors are complainingabout the policy. They don't like the fact that notices of DOD's intentto solicit proposals for a new contract are now published in the CommerceDaily<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>.<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> So what's new? Obviously to the extent that thereis any competition defense industry profits are reduced. Would anyone reallyexpect the Defense contractors to like that?Mr. President, I ask u<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>nan<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>imous consent that the article from the March 31New York Times by Richard Stevens<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>on <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>``Competition for Contracts Trims Costs for Pentagon''be printed in the <T4>Record </T4>at this point.

But the winner used to be able to count on receivinga monopoly contract to manufacture what it designed. Now, in the wake ofwidely publicized procurement scandals and Congressional pressure for atighter rein on contractors, that <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>as<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>surance is gone.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Last year, of the $49.4 billion spent on procuring goods and servicesby the Navy, 55.3 percent was awarded under competitive contracts, up from30.5 percent in the 1983 fiscal year. Of the Air Force's procurement spendingof $40.4 billion last year, 56.5 percent was competitively awarded, upfrom 32.4 percent in 1983.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Now, at a time when new military business is increasingly scarce,executives of most companies think they have no choice but to play thenew game.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">One such contractor is the Hug<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>he<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>s Aircraft Company, a subsidiary of the GM HughesElectronics Corporation, which <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ha<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>s lost shares of several missile programs in thelast few years to the Raytheon Corporation. Hughes is now turning aroundand suggesting to Congress that the building of Raytheon's Hawk and Patriotmissiles be opened to competition from a second source.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">``If our business gets second-sourced and we don't get other people'sbusiness, we're going to end up with less and less,'' said Donald H. White,president of Hughes. ``You can't do that just because you disagree withthe policy.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Similarly, executives at the Lockheed Corporation are rethinking theirpolicy of not pursuing ``second source'' business. ``We've been standingon the sidelines with a sneer,'' one Lockheed executive said. ``Now ourpeople are saying we should take a closer look.<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>''<CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>5</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213></ITAG>[S10MY8-24]{S5331}the shapes<ITAG tagnum="89">the shapes of competition</ITAG>[S10MY8-25]{S5331}<ITAG tagnum="21">In some cases the new push for competition has meant adding a secondproducer to compete with the original one.

This could mean that annualpurchases of some types of weapons will no longer be high enough to enablemore than one contractor to produce those weapons profitably. </ITAG>[S10MY8-30]{S5331}caution in<ITAG tagnum="89">caution in the government</ITAG>[S10MY8-31]{S5331}<ITAG tagnum="21">Some Government officials and other experts agree that there is causefor concern. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">``There have been cost savings from the increase in competition,''said Senator Jeff Bingaman, a Democrat from New Mexico who is chairmanof Defense industry and Technology subcommittee of the Senate Armed ServicesCommittee. ``At the same time, the concerns that some industry people raiseare valid. You can get to the point where you're emphasizing cost at theexpense of quality, and you can build in disincentives for a firm investingin research.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Industry executives say the cost savings exaggerated by the armedservices because even a monopoly producer's prices often fall as assemblyworkers and technicians become more experienced on a project.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Analysts caution that not every competitive production program willgenerate savings in the long run. On those projects where rival companiesmust invest large sums in tooling and machinery, low bids may be followedby higher ones down the road as competitors scramble to recoup their outlays,analysts say. </ITAG>[S10MY8-32]{S5331}the limits<ITAG tagnum="89">the limits on competition</ITAG>[S10MY8-33]{S5331}<ITAG tagnum="21">On other projects, the Pentagon acknowledges that it is unclear whetherits large investments to help new bidders get up to speed will pay offin the form of sufficiently low prices. ``The jury is still out on someof the larger programs,'' said Mrs. Spector, the pr<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>oc<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>urement official. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Military officials say they are aware of the limits to using dualsourcing. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Despite Congressional pressure that followed rumors of major problemswith production of the B-2 Stealth bomber, the Air Force decided last yearthat, because only 132 are to be built, establishing another productionsource was not financially feasible. Northrop is the sole producer. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Similarly, the Air Force concluded last year that no company couldmatch the efficiency of General Dynamics in building the 1,800 F-16 fighterjets it wants to acquire in the next 12-years. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Industry executives and analysts say the potential for the competitionpolicy to be harmful and unfair is highest when a second producer is addedafter the original contractor has invested heavily in developing a particularlycomplex or difficult new product. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Hughes Aircraft spent more than $250 million developing the AdvancedMedium-Range Air-to-Air missile on the assumption that it would recoupits investment in the production phase. But when Raytheon was given a shareof the production, analysts said, it became clear that Hughes might neverrecover its investment. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Cases like that are making companies wary of competing in the expensiveresearch and development phase of a program, which is where the technicalbreakthroughs usually come. ``We have seen an added reluctance on the partof managements to commit resources to risky Randamp;D, program<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> and then have someone come in and pick off halftheir production,'' said Jerry Cantwell, an analyst at Wertheim Schroderandamp; Company, a securities firm. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Independent research and development spending by companies has beenfalling in recent years according to Defense Department figures publishedin a recent study sponsored by several industry associations. Those expendituresdropped to $4.9 billion, or 4.4 percent of the total value of militarycontracts, in 1986, from $5.1 billion, or 5.8 percent of the contracts,in 1984. </ITAG>[S10MY8-34]{S5331}PROXMIREMr. PROXMIRE.

It wasan interesting opportunity to talk with the Communist leaders of thosecountries to get their impressions of what may be the impact on their societiesand also to talk with others, those who have been pushing for change fora good while in both the nations we visited.An article in the Christian Science Monitor of May 4 by John Hughes presentsan interesting discussion of the upheaval that is occurring in Poland today.I think the author captures the essence of the struggle there when he says:[S10MY8-38]{S5331}<ITAG tagnum="21">This jousting between workers and the ruling regime, however, is allpart of a larger picture in which Poles keep testing and nudging, pressingfor as much reform as can be permitted by a regime that must keep Moscowhappy.</ITAG>This, I think, describes the aspirations of those who live in these Communistregimes for more democracy and for more economic progress.We found in Poland a great deal of economic hardship and a great deal ofpressure for economic change.In Poland, since 1981 at least, when Solidarity emerged as a focal pointfor resistance to the status quo, there has been a lot of openness andspeak<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>i<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ng out against some of the policies of the Communistregime, not only by the church, but by alternative newspapers and amongrank and file citizens, a lot of pushing and nudging for change.In Czechoslovakia, the Government is much more repressive and much moreresistant to change of any kind, not tolerating in the least any expressionsof opposition through newspapers, open meetings, or demonstrations of displeasure.There is really quite a contrast between Poland and Czechoslovakia.I commend to the Senate the report of this delegation, which discussesthe group's findings and observations.I want to commend our Deputy Secretary of State, John Whitehead, for theinitiative he has led in trying to find out more about the opportunitieswe may have for interaction with these Eastern European and Central Europeancountries in trade, the discussion of arms control, and the ongoing mutualbalance of force negotiations. All of these concerns are elements of thelarger picture that John Hughes so clearly discusses in his recent article.Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the article be printedin the <T4>Record</T4> at this point.There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the<T4>Record,</T4> as follows:[S10MY8-39]{S5332}[From the <ITAG tagnum="71">[From the Christian Science Monitor,<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>   <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>May 4, 1988]</ITAG>[S10MY8-40]{S5332}Poland's U<ITAG tagnum="74">Poland's Upheaval</ITAG>[S10MY8-41]{S5332}(By John H<ITAG tagnum="71">(By John Hughes)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Is Poland to be the flash point for change in Eastern Europe?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">We have been witnessing the worst labor unrest there in years, withthousands of workers on strike.

He would face strong criticism from his conservativefoes inside the Soviet hierarchy.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">But a Soviet crackdown to maintain Poland in the communist fold wouldshatter the genial image Gorbachev has been projecting to the noncommunistworld.

But beyond the traditional desire of the Poles for freedom, thereis the whiff of glasnost, or openness, in the air. To Gorbachev, glasnostmeans the freedom to discuss more openly how to make communist societieswork better. To many Poles, it is license to carve out a better society,communist-style or not.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">It is this ongoing and larger confrontation that lies in back of thecurrent labor unrest.</ITAG>[S10MY8-42]{S5332}COCHRANMr. COCHRAN.

I visited with Abe Stolar in the Soviet Union. He has been trying to getout for 14 years now. He is given permission, but he cannot take his wholefamily with him. Obviously, he does not want to leave under those circumstances.I want improved relationships with the Soviet Union. You want improvedrelationships, Mr. President. But one of the ways the Soviet Union improvesrelationships is to permit people to emigrate under situations in whichAbe Stolar and his family find themselves.

Of course everyone<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>'s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> amendment is a major amendment when they are presentingit. But as far as taking the time of the Senate on this bill, to give themajority leader some idea, we have a SALT II amendment that we have debatedin the years past. That is always a time-consuming debate.We also have a possible amendment relating to the Persian Gulf and a troopcommitment in the Persian Gulf. That spills over to the war powers question.That could be a time-consuming debate.We will have inevitable amendments on the question of us<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> of military funding, perhaps military personnelin the battle against drugs. That is another amendment. That will requiresom<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>time; a series of amendments.We have, of course, the base closure amendment that we have before us now.I am told there are four or five different parts of that amendment. I willbe talking to Senator <T4>Dixon </T4>and others about that as we proceed. Those amendents willtake probably the rest of the morning. That will be time well spent becausethat is an important question.We have the nuclear testing amendment which we had debate<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>d<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> in this body before but it nevertheless usuallytakes a couple of hours to debate. We will require a rollcall vote on thatone.We have a possible amendment on nuclear carriers, and the question of howmany nuclear carriers we should h<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ve, whether we should indeed phase out certain carriersas we build new nuclear carriers, and replace some of the older carriers.We have chemical amendments that relate to the Bigeye chemical weapon.That, again, is not a new subject for this Senate but nevertheless it takesquite a bit of time.We have the possibility of a Davis-Bacon amendment which again is no strangerto this body. It requires a good bit of time. We will also, I am sure,have a rather vigorous debate on the strategic defen<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>e initiative concept and funding level.  Those represent about nine amendments that will take_my guess is some willtake 3 or 4 hours. I do not anticipate extended debate on any of them althoughwe know that is always a possibility. Some may take more than 2 hours.I guess we are talking about 20 or 25 hours of debate on those 10 amendments.Then we have another 15 or 20 amendments that we already know about. Thoseamendments will take anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour. Some of themwill be accepted, and some of them will require rollcall votes.  So I guess I could summarize my view about where we stand on this billby saying I think it is entirely possible, if we put in a good day today,if we have cooperation on both sides of the aisle_and I think we will_wecan spend a day, early evening tonight, not very late tonight, put Memberson notice that Wednesday night and Thursday <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>n<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ight may go into the evening and we may need to spenda good bit of time in the evening both of those nights, and I think itis conceivable we could finish this bill on Thursday night.  I have talked to Senator <T4>Warner </T4>about this. I think he shar<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>s this assessment. If we do not finish it Thursdaynight at a reasonab<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>l<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>e hour, I suggest we go over into Friday and it wouldbe my suggestion to the majority leader that we stay here as late Fridayas necessary to complete this bill.  The majority leader has already indicated that we have really a limitedamount of time between now and the time we adj<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>o<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>urn sin<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> die. We have two major conventions taking placethis summer, the Democratic Convention and also the Republican Convention.We have this bill as a prelude to the appropriations bill which is very,very important to the military. We have the whole INF debate which is goingto take a minimu<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>m<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> of weeks, not days. There are all sorts of ot<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>her<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> things we have stacked up.  So my point is that it is entirely possible for us to finish this billthis week_Thursday night or Friday night or sometime Friday_if we get Senatorsover, beginning now, to debate and to present their amendment<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>, if we can put i<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>n<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> a good day toda<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>y<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>, and so forth. If we do not, I would ask that westay in as late Friday night as necessary to finish this bill. Of course,if it is hopeless, it is hopeless, and we will have to face that fact whenwe get to it.  I think it is possible, and that is the best assessment at this m<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>om<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ent, having talked to Senator <T4>Warner.</T4>  [S10MY8-73]{S5335}BYRDMr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the ArmedServices Committee for this frank assessment of the amendments that aregoing to be called up on this bill and of the time that will be requiredto deal with these amendments.[S10MY8-74]{S5335}inf treaty<ITAG tagnum="89">inf treaty</ITAG>Let me add to that, to what the chairman has said, by stating that, asI have said before on several occasions, the Senate is not guided by acalendar deadline for a summit in dealing with the INF Treaty. Certainproblems have arisen, and I hope that those problems will be resolved thisweek.The Secretary of State and General Powell are going to Geneva tonight,to meet tomorrow with Soviet leaders, in an effort to clear up some ofthese inspection problems in connection with the INF Treaty. It is possiblethat those can be cleared up. They can be cleared up in hours, they canbe disposed of in days, or they can never be disposed of.I should think it would be in the interests of the Soviets to quit scratchingtheir heads and be candid and frank and up front and forthright with respectto the questions that are to be resolved. They, themselves, can expeditethe action on this treaty. If they want this treaty, they can expeditethe beginning of action in the Senate on this treaty. They are going tohave their opportunity now, tomorrow and the next day, with General Powelland Secretary Shultz.When those gentlem<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>en<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> come back, I think it would be well if the Senateawaits the assessment by the Intelligence Committee and, if necessary,the Armed Services Committee and the Foreign Relations Committee, as towhere we then stand in connection with these inspection problems that havearisen.If I am satisfied that those gaps have been closed, and if I am assuredby the appropriate committees that they have been closed or that they canbe closed during the debate on this floor, then it would be my inclinationto go forward with the treaty. From the beginning, I have been a supporterof it, but I am not a supporter of it if it is going to have multitudinousgaps, or even one gap, through which the Soviets can cheat.So what I am saying is that we will be on this DOD bill this week; butlet no one be under any illusions as to our staying on this bill, if Iam assured, through the committees that have jurisdiction, that we areindeed ready to go on that treaty. Once I get that assurance, that treatywill be taken up in the Senate. There is nobody who can keep this billon the floor once we move to that treaty, because that treaty will be takencare of in executive session, whereas the DOD authorization bill, or anyother legislation, is a matter for the legislative session. A motion togo into executive session to go to that treaty is not debatable.So I say what I am saying to make it perfectly clear that I am going todo everything I can, as the leader, to help the chairman and the rankingmember of this bill to get this bill through this week. But if there isanybody who has an idea that they can hold up the treaty simply by delayingthis bill, that by delaying action on this bill they will be holding upthe treaty, they should be debunked; their minds should be cleared of thatmistaken idea.[S10MY8-75]{S5335}NUNNMr. NUNN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? [S10MY8-76]{S5335}BYRDMr. BYRD. I yield. [S10MY8-77]{S5335}NUNNMr. NUNN. I am delighted that the majority leader has clarified that. Ihave not had anyone threaten or state that they were going to hold up thisbill. But sometimes, in parliamentary situations, there is a feeling thatif you hold up the pending legislation, you delay the legislation thatis coming after. I assured the majority leader, as he already has said, that the INF Treatyis the priority. We are delighted to have this bill up, and we would liketo finish it this week. But if we get everything worked out during thisweek, as the majority leader has outlined, on the INF problems, then Iwill certainly cooperate in every way to take this bill down and to bringup the INF Treaty. I agree with the majority leader's assessment of the importance of theSoviet negotiators being forthcoming at this time, not only to clarifythe problems we have before us_which I do not think are insurmountablebut are important_but also to display the spirit with which we are enteringinto the arms control agreement. The removal of 3 or 4 percent of the warheadsis not the significant part of this treaty. Frankly, it is only a marginalmilitary effect. <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>T<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>he most important part of this treaty is the coherenceof NATO and the fact that we have displayed that coherence and that tenacitywhich is awfully important in terms of deploying missiles and stickingwith a course of action on negotiations for the INF Treaty_that is oneimportant element. The other important element relates to on-site verification,not so much because of this treaty alone, but because of the necessityfor that kind of verification if we are going to make progress in otherforms of arms control. So we are going to learn a lot in the next 3 or 4 days about not only theINF Treaty but also about whether or not we indeed have a breakthroughin on-site verification; because, if on-site verification becomes a nightm<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>re, we will not have made progress and we will havetaken a step backward. So I urge the negotiators for the Soviet Union and the high-level policymakersin the Soviet Union to follow the old adage that when all else fails, readthe directions; and the directions are pretty clear in these three or fourmajor policy disputes that we have right now. At least three of them werenot <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>unanticipated<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> problems. They were problems that had been anticipated,that had been discussed, that had been dealt with, and that had been reducedto writing. They are part of the protocol verification attached to thistreaty. I do not know whether we have a case of sour grapes by one or two low-levelpeople in the Soviet bureaucracy who now are trying to create obstacles,since they may have lost their original position inside the Soviet burea<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>u<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>cracy before the treaty was agreed to. I do not knowwhether that is the case or whether this is a high-level policy kind ofdecision, whether someone is basically making it a policy question whenit has indeed already been dealt with. I do not understand why this could not be solved this week. I told themajority leader privately, before we left, that I thought these problemswere problems that could be solved while the Senate was gone last week,and I am surprised they were not solved.I hope that our own people will be very diligent in pursuing those becauseI think it is important that both sides move forward in a spirit of cooperativeeffort in terms of the all-important precedent we are setting on on-siteverification.I agree with the majority leader's decision to withhold the debate on thistreaty until such time as we get clarification. I am hopeful we will getclarification when Secretary Shultz, General Powell, and others returnfrom Geneva.I agree with the majority leader. This is important. We are strugglingwith the futures questions now. I plan to meet again with several Memberswho have been very involved in this in the Armed Services Committee, includingSenator <T4>Warner, </T4>and try to go over some of the suggested language, exactlywhat kind of weapons, what kind of weapons systems are covered, how wedefine ``weapons systems,'' how we define the difference between warheadsand future other types of possible weapons, and how we distinguish betweenthose things that are prohibited in the treaty and those things that arepermitted that are not weapons like surveillance, RPV. But we are workingon that problem today.I would say there are a lot of balls in the air on this in terms of theSenate. But I believe we all agree that the INF Treaty is the prioritywhen we resolve these problems.I was pleased yesterday that the administration acknowledged that theseare indeed problems. The President made a radio address on Saturday_I readthat address; I did not hear it_and after urging the Senate to go forwardwith ratification of the treaty never mentioned any of these problems.I was concerned whether the President had been completely briefed on thesematters, but I am told that he has.I was delighted yesterday that we did get expressions of concern from theadministration that these were indeed legitimate problems that had to besolved rather than simply urging the Senate to go forward independent ofwhether we had solved the problems or not.So I think there has been a change on the part of the administration relatingto these problems which I find to be healthy. I believe it is importantfor the Senate and the executive branch to move forward together in challengingmisunderstandings in the way the on-site verification will work and inchallenging and making sure we have clarification on the question likethe futures questions.These are not unimportant matters or incidental matters or details. Theygo to the very heart of the meaning of the treaty itself and the spiritin which it is going to be implemented.So that was a long way of saying I agree with the majority leader's position.[S10MY8-78]{S5336}BYRDMr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Georgia.I have resisted having the Senate pressured into premature action on thistreaty. I felt and still feel that this is a matter of such significancethat we ought to be sure where we are going before we head down the road.If there are going to be mistakes made, if there are going to be gaps inthe treaty, we ought to find out now rather than at a time after it hasbeen approved by the Senate and ratified through the exchange of instruments.Now, we find that there are problems and those problems have come to lightthrough the committee system, through the work of the committees in thisSenate. I hope that they can be rectified, and the Soviets have the key.This treaty can be expedited on this floor, at least we <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>c<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>an begin work on it, if the Soviets will take everystep that is necessary to clarify these questions and to close the gaps,and the administration has the responsibility here to stand firm becausewe do not want just a piece of paper, as the President has said, trustbut verify, and the problem ha<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> arisen in the verification procedures, the on-siteinspection, and so on.So, Mr. President, having said that, I also say that once these problemshave been resolved to the satisfaction of these committees and I have bipartisanguidance in the matter that clarifies this Senator's feelings and are indicativethat those matters have been cleared up, the Soviets are agreeing to whatour interpre<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ations are and the Soviets are going to be boundby the same commitments to which this country will be bound under the treatyand that those matters have been cleared, or they can be nailed down duringthe debate, then we will proceed on the treaty.Having been around for quite some time I try to put myself into the positionof somebody who might be opposed to this treaty. If I were opposed to thetreaty I would like to see action go on<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> on<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> the DOD bill for a couple 3 weeks if I thought thatwould hold up the treaty, but I am saying here that it will not hold upthe treaty. Once we feel that the green light is on on this treaty thenthis bill, if it is still before the Senate, will be set aside and we willgo to the treaty.That brings me to the final point, and that is that I hope that Senatorswho have amendments on this bill will come to the floor and call them up.As the chairman has outlined it, it is going to take about all week todispose of this bill if we use the hours most efficiently.I would urge Senators to be here early so that the Senate could get goingon this bill. I hope that we can finish it this week.I yield the floor now.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.[S10MY8-79]{S5336}WARNERMr. WARNER. Mr. President, first, throughout yesterday, Chairman <T4>Nunn,<CODE-213>5</CODE-213></T4><CODE-213>0</CODE-213> the majority leader, the minority leader [Mr. <T4>Dole</T4>], the chairman and ranking member of the Intelligence Committee<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>and I had certain communications with the ForeignRelations Committe<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> and met with former Senator Baker, now Chief ofStaff at the White House, Colin Powell, and others.I think that the majority leader has very correctly stated the sequenceof events and the outcome with respect to the postponement of the deliberationsof this body on the INF Treaty.I would simply add that also during the course of yesterday and again thismorning I had opportunities to meet with the Secretary General of NATO,Lord Carrington. We discussed the impact of these most recent developmentson the worldwide scene and primarily the NATO <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>countries. We all recall it was the tremendous cohesionand <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>solidarity among the NATO countries that indeed contributedsubstantially to the development of this treaty through the negotiationsunder the direction of President Reagan.We are conscious here in this Chamber of their important contribution.I think that we would want to le<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ve our allies, the NATO countries, with a sense ofconfidence in the judgments now being made with respect to the schedulingand it is done in a bipartisan manner and in the best of interest of tryingto go forward on the treaty at the earliest possible date in the most expeditiousmanner we know how.At the moment we are meeting in the Intelligence Committee on various aspectsof this treaty. Therefore, until the work of the committees is concluded,as the majority leader stated and the minority leader has stated and concurredin by the chief of staff of the White House, we will just have to waita while.But it would be my expectation that during the course of this week, particularlythe return of the National Security Advis<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>or<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> Thursday night, and the Secretary of State on Friday,we would be able to get a clear picture of the scheduling of this treaty.[S10MY8-80]{S5336}BYRDMr. BYRD. It will depend, as I said from the beginning, on whether or notthese matters have been clarified to the extent that we can be confidentthat this country is going to be bound by no more than the Soviet Unionwill be bound and that the Soviet Union will be <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>b<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ound by the same commitments to which our countryis bound. That will be the guiding light as far as I am concerned and Ithink it has proved to be a pretty wise course to take.[S10MY8-81]{S5336}recess fro<ITAG tagnum="89">recess from 12:45 p.m. until 2 p.m. today</ITAG>[S10MY8-82]{S5336}BYRDMr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate standin recess today from the hour of 12:45 until the hour of 2 o'clock p.m.to accommodate the two party conferences.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.The Senator from Nebraska.[S10MY8-83]{S5336}EXONMr. EXON. Mr. President, let me just take a moment to compliment the majorityleader; the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, the Senator from<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>G<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>eorgia; and the Senator from Virginia for the outstandingjob they have done on this whole matter of the ratification of this treaty.As the majority leader knows, I believe it was this Senator who stood backthere for 15 or 20 minutes a few months ago and said that I was anxiousto move the decision on this treaty ahead rapidly, that I was generallyimpressed with the job__[S10MY8-84]{S5336}BYRDMr. BYRD. Mr. President, I wonder if we might have order in the Senatewhile the Senator is speaking.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will suspend.Senators engaged in conversation will retire to the <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>C<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>loakroom. The Senate will be in order so the Senatormay make <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>h<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>is debate on the floor. The Senator from Nebraska,Senator, <T4>E<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>x<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>on, </T4>has the floor.The Senator from Nebraska.[S10MY8-85]{S5336}EXONMr. EXON. I thought it was important that we take this matter up as soonas possible. I think that, with all deliberate speed and consideration,the majority leader has been trying to move this particular bill through.As an early supporter of the thought behind this treaty_and I still feelthat way very strongly_I think that we are now down to a situation wherewe are asking the Soviets to put up or shut up with re<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>gard<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> to on<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ite inspections. I am very pleased to see the bipartisansupport for laying this matter aside until those important issues are resolved.I thank all for their participation in that.I would simply point out that sometimes we make less than thoughtful deliberationson all of these matters. We are giving a great deal of attention at thepresent time, Mr. President, to whether or not we can inspect the peripheralareas around the few places where we can indeed have onsite inspectionsin the Soviet Union.One of the shortcomings of this treaty from the very beginning, in my view,has been that we can only inspect in the Soviet Union and they in turncan only inspect here on particular sites, very specified, very definedsites. I have always had the concern that if there is something that eitherside wanted to do to keep from the others, they would go someplace elsewhere we would be specifically excluded from going to make on<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ite inspections. Some of that, of course, can bemaintained by surveillance or can be maintained by other means.Let us not oversell this conc<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>pt of onsite inspections because at best it is aminor step in the right direction for onsite inspections which has beenfundamental to verification of treaties with the Soviet Union for a long,long time.I would just like to make one other suggestion, if I might, Mr. President.We wasted most of yesterday on this very important bill. We had one vote,if I recall, on a relatively minor matter. I find the majority leader andthe leaders of this bill on the floor appealing as they always do on M<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>o<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ndays and Tuesdays of each week to ``please comeover and offer your amendments.'' I suspect that that must be one of themost frustrating jobs of all of the majority leader to have people comeforth with amendments, even though the Senator from Georgia has just outlineda series of amendments that are going to take a lot of time.I always ask myself: ``Why can't people come to the floor and offer theiramendments?<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>''<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> Sometimes the same people who will not offer theiramendments are the ones that ask at 9 and 10 and 11 o'clock at night, ``Whyare we here?'' We did not do much yesterday and we h<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ve not done anything today, and it is after 10:30this morning.I am just wondering if maybe we could ask, maybe right now, Mr. President,for some time agreements on some of the amendments and see if we couldget unanimous consent that on amendments that are offered debate wouldgo on for no more than an hour equally divided; if that will not sell,2 hours equally divided; if that will not sell, 3 hours equally divided.If we could do that, at least we could get some placing of responsibilityas to why it is we move at such a snail's pace. Once again I harken back and I salute the Senate for the d<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>el<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>iberate pace that it followed on the treaty ratificationproposition. That is a place where the deliberations and the time-consumingrules of the U.S. Senate were used, I think, very wisely. However, we are in a situation today where we have a whole lot of amendments.Many of them, in the opinion of this one Senator, are not going to be verywell received by Members of the U.S. Senate; in other words, I think manyof them will if offered for a rollcall vote and likely be voted down bya siz<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ble majority. It would seem to me that amendmentssuch as those, while every right of the individual Senator should be protected,should have some time agreements on them so we can move this bill ahead.I am very fearful of the situation that if we do not move faster than weare now, we are going to go over into the next week, which I know willonly complicate the difficulty in scheduling that the majority leader conventionallyhas. So I appeal to Senators to come to the floor to offer their amendmentsto this bill. I renew my suggestion that this is the time to ask for timeagreements on some of these amendments, for no other reason than we mightbe able to dislodge Senators from wherever they are, doing whatever theyare doing, which I am sure are important matters, but to move the billahead more speedily than it has thus far on the floor of the Senate.[S10MY8-86]{S5337}BYRDMr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. If that question were tobe asked right now, there would only be four Senators on the floor whowould hear it. So, obviously, we cannot get a time agreement at this moment.I would think there would be a propitious moment, however, when Senatorsare on the floor and we might inquire as to how many of them have amendmentsand as to whether or not they would agree on a time limit.I observe the distinguished Senator from Delaware. I believe he may havean amendment. There is a pending amendment before the Senate.One of the approaches that I have taken, in order to get the Senate inearly and get started on a bill reasonably early, was that of having theSergeant at Arms request the attendance of absent Senators. Now it hasbeen very interesting to note that in many instances there are certainSenators who come to the floor and they do not want to vote for that motion.In other words, if I were their constituents I would say: ``What's thematter? Don't you want to get those other Senators out of bed and get themup to Chamber and get to work?''I do not get the support of all Senators even in asking the Sergeant atArms to request the attendance of absent Senators. But one of the purposesof that motion that I make from time to time is to get Senators to the<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>f<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>loor so those who have amendments will begin to workon them and those who want to talk against amendments will be here to starttalking.Perhaps I better put in a quorum call now.[S10MY8-87]{S5337}DOLEMr. DOLE. Will the distinguished majority leader yield?[S10MY8-88]{S5337}BYRDMr. BYRD. Yes, I yield to the distinguished Republican leader.[S10MY8-89]{S5337}DOLEMr. DOLE. I yield to the distinguished Senator from Nebraska.[S10MY8-90]{S5337}EXONMr. EXON. If I might add just one other comment. Could we start the processby coming to an agreement, which I think probably could be established,that no amendment would be in order for consideration unless it is filedat the desk by some hour, say, noon tomorrow, something of that nature,so that we could begin to get some idea of how many amendments there possiblycould be? It would seem to me anybody who has a serious amendment wouldat least be able to file or offer the amendment at this time. If not, itwould not be in order for consideration during the time that would followwhen we are considering this measure.[S10MY8-91]{S5337}DOLEMr. DOLE addressed the Chair.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.[S10MY8-92]{S5337}DOLEMr. DOLE. Mr. President, I certainly want to help the distinguished majorityleader. I know the problem. I am making an effort on this side to get peopleover here with amendments, because as 8 or 9 o'clock in the evening rollsaround, these same people who are not here in the morning will be saying,``Why are we in so late?'' I understand what the problem is.At our policy luncheon at noon I will get a list of four or five that wecan rely on to expedite the process. This is a very important piece oflegislation. It should be disposed of this week. I <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>certainly <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>want to be helpful to the distinguished majorityleader and the managers who have been working on this legislation for weeksand weeks and weeks.[S10MY8-93]{S5337}F<ITAG tagnum="66">F</ITAG>[S10MY8-94]{S5337}THE INF TR<ITAG tagnum="81">THE INF TREATY</ITAG>[S10MY8-95]{S5337}DOLEMr. DOLE. Mr. President, I report to the Senate that we have been visitingwith the President this morning. The subject of the discussion was theINF Treaty. The President is in full accord with the bipartisan announcementyesterday afternoon, made by the majority leader, myself, and other Senators,that there are some problems that should be resolved and will be resolved.General Powell and Secretary Shultz will be leaving for Geneva later today.It is my hope that they can resolve the legitimate questions which wereraised by a number of Members in this body on both sides who are expertsin various areas that affect the INF agreement. The President is in fullaccord with the announcement of last evening. He still is very hopefulof course that these matters can be resolved very quickly and, as indicatedin the past, once they are, we will move ahead on consideration of thetreaty.But I wanted my colleagues to know that there is no disagreement. Theseare issues that must be resolved. The President understands that the Senatehas the cons<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>itutional responsibility of dealing with this treaty.He understands that there are at least three committees that spent hoursand hours and some days and days and weeks conducting hearings, lookingat the treaty.

So thatwas the discussion this morning with myself; Senator <T4>Stevens </T4>from Alaska; Senator <T4>Simpson, </T4>the assistant leader on this side; and Senator <T4>Lugar </T4>of the Foreign Relations Committee.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition? The Senator from <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>I<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>llinois, Senator <T4>Dixon. </T4>[S10MY8-98]{S5338}DIXONMr. DIXON. What is the order of business, Mr. President? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The order of business is the pending Dixon amendment.[S10MY8-99]{S5338}DIXONMr. DIXON. Mr. President, the issue before the Senate is the question ofthe provision in this bill regarding base closures, which I spoke uponat length yesterday. I said at that time, in an oversimplistic explanationof the provision in this bill, that what this bill says now is that theSecre<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ary of Defense, Secretary Carlucci, may appoint acommission. I am told, in effect, that he has actually done that; that there has beenplaced in the Federal Register the names of members that the Secretaryof Defense, Mr. Carlucci, would suggest should be members of this commission.Again, oversimplifying what the provisions of this bill state, that commissionin cooperation with the Secretary of Defense would look at domestic basesin the United States, not foreign bases, and make a recommendation of alist of bases that should be closed to the Secretary of Defense, by December31 of this year. But I believe the report is to be made back to the Secretary of Defenseby the end of this year, December 31. A provision of this act then provides, that the Secretary of Defense maythen close every one of those bases or none of them. He may not selectan intermediate number. That was disputed in the committee but it was resolvedin favor of the original language in this section of the bill. That hethen closes all the bases or he closes none. So obviously he will closeall of them. That is essentially what this bill provides. In the event I did not makeit clear yesterday, I want to make this point today because my friend fromMichigan, for whom I have the highest regard, just made this statementin a private conver<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ation between the chairman of the committee, thedistinguished Senator from Georgia; and the ranking member, the distingui<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>hed Senator from Virginia. I want to echo what hesaid. I am not against base closings. There should be some base closings in thecountry. Everybody would agree with that. I am against killing a gnat witha bat. And that is what this bill does. It kills a gnat with a bat. Weare taking away all congressional power, giving up our involvement in theprocess, ceding it to the Secretary of Defense who picks the people whoclose the domestic bases without any involvement of the Congress. Thatbothers me a lot. <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>M<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>r. President, I want to address something that wassaid by someone else yesterday, I cannot remember who. I did a C-SPAN talkshow last night for an hour after <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>being on <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>the floor. Many people who follow the Senate calledin and had questions.My colleagues have done this. They understand the process. Somebody calledin from Bethesda, MD, saying they never closed a base_you do not closebases the way it is now. I have a report from the Congressional Research Service of the Libraryof Congress that since 1969, 485 installations and activities have beenclosed in this country; 485. That is a fairly good number. Since this administrationcame to power, in 1980, they have never sent up an official request tothe Congress for a base closure. Just think of that. We are contemplatingthe most dramatic, gross, finite, undemocratic step one can contemplate,a step that has never been undertaken on any other subject matter in mylegislative experience going back to my election in the Illinois Housein January <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>1<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>950 on a subject where the record shows there hasbeen a good deal of success in the past.Mr. President, I did not come here to say that there is not some controversyinvolved in this. But every one of us are in public life; we understandcontroversy and the nature of it. I do not mind a little controversy.If the Secretary of Defense, acting on the initiative of the administration,sends us a list of bases to be closed and if they are carefully selected,not partisan instruments but designed to save the taxpayers money and toclose unneeded and unnecessary bases in this country on a selective basis,I would bet my reputation those bases will be closed_after a doggoned goodfight, I would concede. Because those Congress people and those Senatorsaffected are going to object to it.But in my view, there would be a result that would close a substantialnumber of bases. I would hope that we could resolve this problem. I thinkthis Sen<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>tor's reputation for being a Senator who wants toenter into honorable accommodation is well known. I am willing to discusschanges in this legislation, meaningful changes, that keep the legislativeprocess involved while achieving some base closings. I would like to saysome things that I think ought to take place.I think somehow the Congress has to be in the process. Maybe it is to bean expedited procedure and a vote by the Congress of disapproval. Thereare a variety of things that can be done in that connection. But the Congresssometime has to be involved, in my view. That is part of the democraticsystem we are involved in, in this great Nation of ours, and we ought notto give away the power of the Congress to be involved in the issue.I think there has to be some kind of regional balance. I am not sayingperfect regional balance, but I read the list the other day. Here is thelist. I will read it again. These are good people. I am not in any waydenigrating the reputation of any of these people.Abe Ribicof<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>f,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> of Connecticut. I do not know him personally. EverythingI have ever heard about him is that he was an outstanding Senator and Governorof Connecticut and a fine public man; Jack Edwards<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> of Alabama, the same, a fine man; Donald Craib<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> of California, now; Philip Cabot<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> of Boston; Martin Hoffman here in the District;General Poe, retired, of Alexandria, VA; General Starry of Fairfax, VA;Graham Claytor, I understand inside th<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> Beltway somewhere in the District of Columbia area;Russell Train of Washington. Mostly eastern representation. I have nothingagainst the East. A lot of nice people live out here in the East. I havea house on the Hill only a stone's throw away, and I like my neighbors,but I also have a home back in Belleville, IL. And 11.5 million citiz<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>en<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>s the<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>re<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> I represent would like to have input in this process.So I think the <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>C<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ommissio<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>n<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> has to have regional balance, Mr. President, sothat all parts of our great Nation are represented in the process. I thinkthere ought to be a finite number of commissioners, incidentally. Thisbill does not even call for the number the Secretary of Defense could select.He has given us nine here. Presumably he could add more. But I think thereought to be a finite number and there ought to be regional balance. I believealso, if we are looking at domestic base closures, we ought to look atforeign base closures.When I was on C<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>-<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>SPAN last night, everybody called in and said: ``Wait,maybe we could close a base here or there in this country, sure, but whatabout all of them all over the world?''People called in and said: ``Hey, we put those bases there, and we payto have them there.'' We give foreign countries hundreds of millions ofdollars to have them there, in addition to the cost of the base. And thePresident knows that is so. So that ought t<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>o<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> be a consideration in this whole process.The point I make is this one: I think that there are some people aroundhere of a like mind as this Senator, including my dis<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>inguished friend from Michigan, who is on the floor.I think it is a fair statement that my friend, the senior Senator fromAlaska, has a like view. My friend, the senior Senator from Maine, indicatedsome concerns about this. There are people of both political persuasions,all of whom have been here longer than this Senator, who I think wouldbe interested in working for a resolution to this problem.The chairman of the committee, the distinguished senior Senator from Georgia,and the ranking member, the distinguished senior Senator from Virginia,have indicated a willingness to discuss a resolution of the problem.I thank my colleague from Michigan who has so of<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>en, because of his insightful views, been helpfulin these matters. It appears he might have some comments about this. Iwonder if he would care to make some comments at this time because I thinkit would be useful to hear the different points of view about this. I believemy colleagues will yield the floor so my friend from Michigan can makesome comments.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yields the floor. The Chair recognizesthe Senator from Michigan [Mr. <T4>Levin</T4>].[S10MY8-100]{S5339}LEVINMr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first of all, let me commend my friend from Illinoison what he is trying to do here. He is making an extremely important point,and that is that the base closing protections that we have in the law arethere to make sure that when base closings are accomplished, and many ofthem have to be accomplished, that it is done so fairly; that it is notdone for political reasons, for retaliation, retribution or whatever. Ifand when base closings take place, and again, I am of the opinion thatsome bases and facilities must be closed, it should be done in a way thatpublic credibility is created and sustained. These are not easy thingsto do. The people in our communities heavily rely on these bases, not just forthe national security, but for the local economy. When bases are closed,there better be some credibility behind that decision. It better not lookpolitical. Our base closing laws, as a matter of fact, are the result of what appearedto be some political base closings. My recollection is that the originof the congressional restrictions on base closings, which we basicallyhave retained in the law over the years, is what happened in Massachusettsin the early 1970's. Massachusetts was the only State to vote Democraticin 1972 and what happened in 1974? President Nixon's Pentagon came up witha list of bases to be closed, and Massachusetts was disproportionatelyand heavily impacted by that list. That created some real problems of credibility and perception, and so therewere some protections written into the law. Have we overdone it? Maybe.Maybe we ought to have some greater executive power.But let me remind my colleagues <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>hat there was a rea<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>on for this protection. This country is based ona premise that we do not want all power in one branch of this Government.There was too much power for the executive branch to unilaterally closebases, and Congress did something about it. We have modified the law sincethen but we did something about it in the 1970's because of what appearedto be a hit list o<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>n<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> the part of the Nixon Pentagon against a State,the only State, which had voted against President Nixon in 1972. As I have indicated, Mr. President, we need to act, but we have to actin a balanced way. I do not think too many Members of this Senate would vote for a provisionwhich simply said to the Secretary of Defense: ``You go ahead and closewhatever bases you want. We are going to waive all the environmental protectionlaws. We are going to waive the protections that are put in law againstadverse Federal actions. You just go ahead and close whatever bases youwant unilaterally.'' [S10MY8-101]{S5339}DIXONMr. DIXON. Will my friend from Michigan yield?[S10MY8-102]{S5339}LEVINMr. LEVIN. I will be happy to yield.[S10MY8-103]{S5339}DIXONMr. DIXON. That is what this bill does.[S10MY8-104]{S5339}LEVINMr. LEVIN. That is exactly my next line.[S10MY8-105]{S5339}DIXONMr. DIXON. I am sorry to interrupt.[S10MY8-106]{S5339}LEVINMr. LEVIN. No, I am happy to have the Senator say it because he says itbetter than I can. I do not mean to interrupt. I yield to the Senator further,but that is precisely the point. That is what we are doing in this bill.[S10MY8-107]{S5339}DIXONMr. DIXON. Exactly right.[S10MY8-108]{S5339}LEVINMr. LEVIN. Because this <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>C<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ommission is not a commission that is independentof the Pentagon; it is not a commission that has its own staff. There isno provision for staff in this bill. This is a total delegation to theDepartment of Defense with but one little protection, and that is thatthe Secretary of Defense, if by chance he does not like his own commission'srecommendation, which has been staffed by the people of the Secretary ofDefense, cannot modify it. He has to take it or leave it.That is not much of a protection when the members of the <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>C<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ommission have been selected by the Secretary ofDefense, it is staffed by the Secretary of Defense, and there is no independentstaff provided for in this bill. So, in effect, what we have done is giventhe Secretary of Defense the unilateral authority to close bases. It istoo big a grant of power.As my friend from Illinois has pointed out with his usual eloquence andpungency, what Congress is doing here is handing over exclusively to theSecretary of Defense the right to close whatever base<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> his commission, using his staff, has determinedhe wants to do.This is an excessive delegation of power. It is not in keeping with ourcelebration of the Constitution, which calls for divided power<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>.<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>It<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> says there should be balance to the exercise ofpower.So one of the things that I would<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> add<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> to my friend's list of items that we ought to tryto work on in a compromise provision is that the Commission should havethe right to have its top staff selected by that Commission. They shouldnot be members of the DOD staff. The only way we are going to h<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ve a semblance of confidence and credibility in therecommendations of this Commission is if in fact that Commission has someindependence of the Pentagon. If it is simply an arm of the Secretary ofDefense, we might as well not kid ourselves by appointing a Commission.We might as well simply tell the Secretary of Defense: Decide what youwant to do and do it.So if we want a bipartisan <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>c<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ommi<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ssion<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> with an implication of independence, let us havea bipartisan <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>c<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ommission with some possibility of independence.Let it have some of its top staffers appointed by that Commissio<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>n<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>. How in the name of Heaven do we really expect theCommission to look at all 3,800 facilities, about 500 of which are major,between now and December of this year? We are not creating the Commission,by the way. We are relying on a <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>c<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ommission which has been created by the Secretaryof Defense. We are simply incorporating his <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>c<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ommission, already chartered by him, in our bill.<CODE-213>5</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>But should we really kid anybody that that Commission is able between nowand December to look at every single military installation inside the UnitedStates and make a fair and objective analysis as to which ones should bekept open and which ones should be closed? Every member of the Commissio<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>n<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> which the Secretary of Defense has already selected,<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>I<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> believe are occupied with other things<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> and yet we have a provision in subsection 3(B) ofthis bill on page 162 which says:[S10MY8-109]{S5339}<ITAG tagnum="21">The Commission must certify that it has identified the military installationsto be closed or realigned after reviewing all military installations insideof the United States.</ITAG>``All military installations inside the United States.'' Our quick analysisis that there <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>are<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> about 3,800 such installations and perhaps 500 aremajor installa<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ti<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ons. Let us not kid ourselves as to what this languagedoes. This language is a dele<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>g<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ation, a total dele<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>g<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ation to the Secretary of Defense through an armof the Secretary of Defense, using the staff of the Secretary of Defense,totally dependent upon the Pentagon, of the power to unilater<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>lly close bases inside this country without the protectionthat has been put into law to make sure that such power is not <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>bused.  That is what this language does. It does it with a good motive, the motivebeing that we ought to close some bases; that there are some we cannotjustify. I happen to agree with my good friend, Senator <T4>Nunn, </T4>and my good friend, Senator <T4>Warner, </T4>in their determination that we try to make it more feasibleto close some bases that should be closed. I happen to agree with that.But I am not in agreement with a total delegation of the power to closebases to the Secretary of Defense, as much as I like the Secretary of Defenseand think he is a good Secretary of Defense, an honorable Secretary ofDefense. I am not willing to cede that power to any Secretary of Defense,even one that I have as much confidence in as I do Secretary Carlucci. So some of the things that we should do to make this provision more credibleare the things which the Senator from Illinois has defined. There shouldbe additional members of the Commission so that it can be more balancedgeographically. I would think that this Commission and the Secretary ofDefense ought to solicit recommendations from the National Governors Association.When you close a base, you have an economic impact, not just a securityimpact. Those economic impacts shoul<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>d<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> be assessed and assessed fairly. At least thereshould be input from people who are directly affected. We should make surethat there is some voice heard, not dominate necessarily, that the meritsof its argument dominate or not, but we ought to have at least some voicef<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>rom<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> people who represent localities.  I hope that if we add members to this Commission, the Secretary of Defensewould solicit recommendations not just<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> from<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> the Congress, which I think would be very useful,but also solicit some recommendations from the National Governors Association. I would suggest something else that we add to the list that my friend from<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>I<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>llinois has set forth for discussion and possiblecompromise, and that is that Congress be given the right to veto up ordown the entire list. Just as the Secretary of Defense is given the rightto veto the list of his own Commission, I would think that we ought tohave a similar right. We should not have the right necessarily to amendthat list. That is not what I am suggesting. What I am suggesting, however,is that since the Secretary of Defense can veto without amendment the recommendationsof his own Commission, we should have a similar right with expedited procedures.It would be imp<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>or<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>tant that if we are going to in fact have the practicalright to exercise a veto, if it were approprite, the usual expedited procedurebe provided so that we could get to it without being delayed by filibusteror provision of some House rule. Mr. President, what it comes down to is that we should act, that the chairmanand ranking minority member of the Armed Services Committee and other me<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>mbers<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> of the committee have approved a provision whichis intended to do something we<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>all ought to support, which is to make it possibleto close some bases that need to be closed, but what we have to do is workon language to make sure that when we close bases, that decision has somecredibility so that people whose lives are directly impacted by these baseclosings in fact feel that they had some voice somewhere along the linethat could be heard. Maybe that voice will not be followed, and that alwaysis a good possibility in a democracy, but at least let us have an opportunityfor the voice of people impacted by base closings to be heard. And so some of the changes we ought to make I believe are as follows: Thechanges that my friend from Illinois has identified. There should be broaderregional representation. There should be some congressional involvement. I believe that, in additionto the added members to this Commission, the Secretary of Defense shouldbe urged to solicit recommendations for one or two members of the Commissioncoming from the National Governors Association list of recommendations.I believe there should be a veto possible by the Congress with expeditedprocedures, and it would be an up or down veto without the possibilityperhaps of amending the list. I believe we should provide for some staffso that this Commission, if it is truly to take an independent look atthese bases and these facilities, will at least have the opportunity tohave its staff lead that effort. Otherwise, it is purely an arm of theDepartment of Defense. Without these kinds of changes, we might as well acknowledge what it reallyis: an adjunct of the Secretary of Defense which is provided solely forthe purpose of giving the appearance of some bipartisanship or independencebut which in fact has very little of either. We can do these things. We can provide this kind of balance to avoid theunilateral exercise of power of the Secretary of Defense. The chairmanof the committee, Senator <T4>Nunn</T4>, and Senator <T4>Warner</T4>, have already indicated a willin<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>gn<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ess to participate in<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>o<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>me discussion to<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>make some changes in this language so that we cancome up with a product in which we would have greater confidence. I hopethat th<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>o<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>se discussions would continue. They are very importantbecause I think most of us are on the same side of this issue. Most ofus are willing, provided it is done fairly and credibly and with localinput, with opportunity for voices to be heard on the part of the peopleto be impacted by these c<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>losing<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>s_with those kinds of caveats, we are willing tosee some changes in base closing law so that in fact some base closingscould take place. That would protect national security interests and helpto create at least in the long<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>run some savings and <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>lso provide some element of fairness that we sh<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>o<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>uld guarantee to people in a democracy. Mr. President, I commend my friend from Illinois for what he has done tobring this to our attention, for his insistence that we bring out theseissues in a way which is fair to all people in our States. He again hasshown the kind of leadership that we all are so accustomed to and cherish.I yield the floor. (Mr. FOWLER assumed the chair.)[S10MY8-110]{S5340}DIXONMr. DIXON addressed the Chair.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.[S10MY8-111]{S5340}DIXONMr. DIXON. Mr. President, in his usual clear and concise manner, my warmfriend, the distinguished Senator from Michigan, upon whom we rely so frequentlyin the Armed Services Committee, has demonstrated what ought to be theconcern of every Member about the provisions of this bill.Mr. President, you remember when he said in the beginning of his remarksno Senator here would agree to giving the Secretary of Defense absolutepower to close bases all over the country without any input from the Congress;you remember when he said that. This Senator said but that is what thisbill does. He said the Senator from Illinois is quite right.I hope a lot of Senators or their staffs who are concerned about this subjectmatter are paying attention to what I am going to do now because, believeit or not, I am going to read from the bill. There is an enlightenment,Mr. President, in reading from the bill. Here is the bill. Here is page161, section 923, ``Closure and Realignment of Military Installations,''and I read from the text:[S10MY8-112]{S5340}<ITAG tagnum="21">In general, the Secretary of Defense shall, one, close all militaryinstallations recommended for closure by the commission on base realignmentand closure in the report transmitted to the Secretary_that is the Secretaryof Defense_<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>p<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ursuant to the charter establishing such a commission<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>.<CODE-213>0</CODE-213></ITAG>That is a direct quote.Now, I go to page 170 of t<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>he<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> bill, line 8, section 3:[S10MY8-113]{S5341}<ITAG tagnum="21">The terms ``commission on base realignment and closure'' and ``commission''mean the commission established by the Secretary of Defense in the chartersigned by the Secretary on May 3, 1988.</ITAG>This is May 10. A week ago on May 3, 1988, in the <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>R<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>egister<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> the Secretary of Defense put these names. So page161 says the Secretary of Defense may close all military installationsrecommended by the commission on base realignment, page 170 says he appointsa commission, and on May 3 he has done it. So this commission he selected,hand<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>picked, chose as his people, now has the authorityif we pass this bill to close these bases? By when? By December 31, 1988,see page 162, lines 9 and 10. By December 31 of this year.What bases? ``A statement certifying that the commission has identifiedthe military installations to be closed or realigned after reviewing allmilitary installations''_listen to this_``inside the United States.''And then, of course, elsewhere in the bill on page 170, the United Statesis defined as the 50 States, the District of Columbia, Commonwealths ofPuerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands, and American Samoa, but certainlyno other bases in the world.I stated yesterday, Mr. President, how much we are spending on bases inthe world at large. It is $35 billion this year, and $37 billion next year.We are not looking at them. We are looking at bases in this country. Andthe Secretary has the authority to close these bases under this bill justas my friend from Michigan suggested he had that authority.This bill, Mr. President_is representative of the greatest gift of powerby <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>the <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Congress to an administrative agency in the historyof this democratic institution; I would have to say that we need to do something to correct that. <ITAG tagnum="58">0<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Mr. President, may I say at this point in time thatif there are Senators who have amendments who woul<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>d<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> like to offer them to this bill, this amendmentcould be set aside. We are going to spend some time trying to resolve thesedifferences. This first amendment<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> frankly<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> is only one in a series that delineate all of ourconcerns with this section of the bill. But if there are other amendmentsthat any Senators have that they would like to bring over here at thispoint in time, either amendments that can be accepted, if they are noncontroversialones, or other amendments that will require rollcalls, may I say in theabsence of the two managers who are at an Intelligence Committee meetingI am prepared to say we are willing to consider other amendments at thispoint in time. </ITAG>I do not see other Senators on the floor at this time prepared to addressthose other amendments. But I would hope that they would come forward.Mr. President, another point I wanted to make is this: There have neverbeen any hearings at all on this question. I guess that is what you hearmost in this body when you are debating controversial things. People saywe have not had adequate committee hearings. On this issue we have hadno committee hearings, no hearings whatsoever in support of this processrecommended by the Secretary of Defense. In the markup on this bill whichwas handled in the usual fair and constructive manner by the chairman andthe ranking member, we brought this up last because everybody knew it wouldbe somewhat controversial. But there were no oversight hearings or anyinput at any time by any people around the country who have concerns aboutthis process. That again is a matter of some concern to this Senator. I want to read a statement by a colleague of ours who is a very seniorMember here and hig<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>h<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ly respected in connection with this whole questionsome years ago. The Senator from Michigan alluded to the dispute about this in the Nixonera. President Nixon had a base closing effort that was considered in thecontext of that time and that era, a highly politicized attempt to closebases. A number of people <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>were<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> concerned and made speeches at that time, such asSenator <T4>Claiborne Pell, </T4>the distinguished chairman of the Foreign RelationsCommittee, and Senator John Pastore made a statement about it at the time.But here is one I want to read from Senator <T4>Edward Kennedy, </T4>in a statement before the subcommittee in whichhe attacked the Defense Department for failure to on a timely basis submitfull complete data describing and justifying the Defense Department baseclosure and realignment program. Senator <T4>Kennedy</T4>'s statement in part, reads: [S10MY8-114]{S5341}<ITAG tagnum="21">First, I believe that there exists a clear and compelling Congressionalresponsibility, under Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution, to playan equal role with the Executive Department in determining major deploymentand support policies. This responsibility has been underlined in two statutoryprovisions. </ITAG>And he names them.  The interesting thing about this, Mr. President, is that base closureshave taken place as I indicated previously in large numbers right up until1980. The fact is that this legislation at the end of the Reagan administration,in May of the last year, is an initiative to give absolute power to theSecretary of Defense and the Department of Defense when no effort has beenmade through the legislative process in the Congress to close bases sincethis administration came to power in 1980. Here is a statement by the Secretary of Defense, prior to Secretary Carlucci,made in Marc<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>h<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>1<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>985, and I guess March 1985 is the last time we visitedthis questi<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>o<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>n. That is when there was a kind of hit list floatingaround here. I think there were 21 bases on it. It was never an officiallist. There was never an official request. Here is a list at that timeof base realignment candidates: New Cumberland Army Depot, PA, General Materiel and Petroleum Activity(materiel management); Philadelphia Support Activity, PA (materiel management);Fort Wingate Depot Activity, NM (ammo supply); Army Material Mechanic ResearchCenter, Watertown, ME (Randamp;D); Letterkenny Army Depot, PA; FitzsimonsArmy Medical Center, CO (health care); Fort Ruger, HI (<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>dmin<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>istration<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> support); Fort Devens, MA; Cameron Station, VA (admin<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>istration<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> facility); Jefferson Proving Grounds, IN (ammo testing).I can understand why the two Senators from Pennsylvania, who are at a funeraltoday for the mayor of Pittsburgh, want to be back before we vote thisafternoon. I think that is about the fifth Pennsylvania inst<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>allation<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> I have indicated.

This decision was made because closing installations involves largecosts, and given the need to cut the budget deficit, the Department feltit had higher priorities for the required funds.

As part of the effort to regain their competitive edge, manybusinesses have invested heavily during the past few years in new and complexmachinery. This investment is clearly important for the maintenance andreinvigoration of our defense industrial base. However, it has become increasinglyapparent that businesses in particular, and the <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>N<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ation in general are not receiving the full valueof this investment because too much of this equipment is in need of repairand is not actually in use. To put it briefly, this Nation is sufferingfrom a shortage of individuals who are trained to repair these very complexmachines.In recognition of this, the Congress last year authorized from the fundsappropriated pursuant to section 201 of the DOD authorization bill forfiscal year 1989 not more than $31 million for both fiscal year 1988 andfiscal year 1989 for the Center for Advanced Technologies. This centerwo<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>u<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ld seek to assure a defense industrial base by trainingmultiskilled machine technicians capable of building, installing, integrating,maintaining, diagnosing, and modifying technologically advanced equipmentand systems.No funds were appr<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>o<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>priated last year for fiscal year 1988 or fiscalyear 1989.

Mr. President, returning to the amendment before us, the amendmentbefore us, of course, would provide for congressional input on a bipartisanbasis, by providing that the chairman and ranking member of the authorizingsubcommittee in the Senate and the chairman and ranking member of the AppropriationSubcommittee in the Senate that are jurisdictional on the issue, the samein the House, be members of this Commission. It would be the first stepin some repair work on this provision that encompasses pages 161 through171, and it would be entirely bipartisan. There would be two Republicansand two Democrats from each House then involved on the Commission who havea degree of expertise in this issue and an understanding of the processand the concerns of Congress.Now, let me just point out another concern I have. Here is a letter fromthe Secretary of Defense saying that in parallel with the Commission'swork he is initiating a review of our overseas bases to determine if efficienciescan be realized through closures or realignments in our overseas base structure.``This review will be completed in the fall, enabling me to report theresults of this review to the Commission before it completes its work andmakes its final report.''My argument with respect to that would be why limit the jurisdiction ofthis Commission to the United States?I can assure the President and the Members of the Senate that there isa great deal of concern in the country about wastefulness in bases allaround the world, a proliferation of bases all over the world, substantialmoneys spent in addition to those bases all over the world.I believe if you polled the citizens of this country about their concerns,one of their highest priority would be those foreign bases.Here we have a bill designed to contemplate domestic bases in the UnitedStates to the exclusion of what I think most Americans would consider tobe a matter of higher priority, foreign bases, and certainly I think theywould think that at least of equal priority ought to be concern for foreignbases and that that question ought to be incorporated into this whol<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> Commission jurisdiction and be subject to reviewjust like domestic bases.I would like to put again the cost of overseas bases in the <T4>Record.</T4> This is from the Deputy Secretary of Defense to the distinguishedchairman of the Committee on Appropriations, one of our great Senatorsin this body, Senator <T4>John Stennis,</T4> the distinguished Senator from Mississippi, andthe letter is dated April 25, 1988, from the Deputy Secretary of Defense,Mr. William H. Taft IV, to the Honorable <T4>John C. Stennis,</T4> <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>c<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>hairman, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate,Washington, DC<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>.<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> 20510, April 25, 1988.The cost of U.S. bases overseas: Fiscal year 1987, $34.580 billion; fiscalyear 1988, $35.525 billion; fiscal year 1989, $37.080 billion.That is a lot of money, Senator Dirksen, a distinguished Senator from myState, often said aro<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>u<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>nd here ``a billion here, a billion there and prettysoon you are talking about real money''; and you are talking about a lotof money in those bases overseas.<CODE-213>5</CODE-213><T4><CODE-213>0</CODE-213></T4>So, I would think that if we can craft a compromise, we ought to be concernedabout having one that would look at foreign as well as domestic bases andagain regional balance so that all parts of the country are represented,a finite number of members on the Commission, perhaps subject not necessarilyto the approval of the Senate, but I think perhaps the Senate ought tohave some input into some members of that Commission. That is one of thethings I would hope we could work out, that on that Commission not onlythe Secretary of Defense but the Congress would be involved in composition,as I say, a finite number, whatever that <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>number<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> would be with regional representation<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> and all of the things that the Senator from Michiganas well as this Senator talked about previously. I am told, Mr. President, that the distinguished Senator from Washington,Senator <T4>Brock Adams</T4>, will be over here with an amendment within the next5 to 10 minutes. I understand that that amendment has been cleared on bothsides. The point I want to make again is the door is open. We are doing businessand I hope other Senators will come over. The Senator from Washington is coming over and we will shortly set asideonce again this amendment to deal with the amendment of the Senator fromWashington. Mr. President, I yield the floor in view of the presence on the floor ifmy distinguished friend and such a valuable member of the committee andmy <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>S<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ubcommittee on Readiness, the distinguished Senatorfrom Arizona. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator form Arizona [Mr. <T4>McCain</T4>] is recognized. [S10MY8-138]{S5343}McCAINMr. <T4>McC<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>AIN<CODE-213>0</CODE-213></T4>. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the pendingamendment by the distinguished Senator from Illinois, Senator <T4>Dixon</T4>. I would like to, first of all, express the enormous appreciationthat I have for the many kindnesses he has extended to me as a member ofhis subcommittee. I stand with great respect and awe of the dedicationand outstanding work that he has displayed not only as a subcommittee chairmanbut as one of the most effective members of the Armed Services Committee.As with all respected colleagues from time to time we find ourselves indisagreement, and on this amendment I respectfully disagree with my friendand colleague. I think it is important to point out that the information that I have isthe last time a major military installation in this country was closedwas sometime in the early seventies and I believe that that was the BostonNaval Shipyard. A lot of things have happened in the intervening years. A lot of missionsand roles have changed, and technology has made a difference. We have phasedin and out weapons systems. We have experienced reductions in some partof our military forces and we have expanded in others. We have respondedto the shifting challenges and national security requirements that ourNation faces. Mr. President, I know of no knowledgeable American who believes that thereare defense bases and installations in this Nation that cannot be closed.I would hesitate to cite specific bases at this time because then we wouldquickly degenerate into a discussion as to the merits or demerits of particularinstallations.   At the same time, I think it does a great disservice to the taxpayers ofAmerica to make a case that the status quo must remain forever and no installationin this country can be closed. It also harms our image here in the Congressas to the depth of our commitment to saving the taxpayers money and reducingthe waste and inefficiency in defense spending.The biggest problem<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>in obtaining support f<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>o<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>r the increased defense spending<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> that we need in some areas, is the perception ofthe American people that so many of their tax dollars is being fraudulentlywasted and abused. I believe the American people are correct in this perceptionand that my distinguished friend from Illinois is in agreement with meas to the importance of this issue.I do not pretend to argue that a few base closings will change this preceptiondramatically. I do, however, say to you that if we are to show the courageof our convictions and our commitment to the American people, if we areto show we are going to spend their tax dollars wisely, then the closingsof extraneous and unnecessary military facilities is in order.Mr. President, we all want to maintain the military facilities in our States<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>.<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> The very fact that there has not been a single majormilitary installation closed in this country in more than 10 years demonstratesthis fact and indicates that the system is in a state of grid <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>lock.<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> If we continue to operate under the same rules ofthe game_economic impact statements, environmental impact statements, employmentimpact statements and all of the myriad of hoops that the Department ofDefense has to jump through to achieve the closing of a single facility_wewill never close a major base in this country.The present reliance on congressional approval has failed for the last10 years. What in the world can make us believe that we will succeed duringthe next 10 years if we stick to present rules of the game? That is whyI am support<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ing<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> the proposal that we create a blue ribbon panelwhich is objective in nature, and which will make these decisions for us.<CODE-213>5</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>5</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>I think that my friend from Illinois does raise an important question.Why should the Congress give some outside body this kind of authority andresponsibility? I think the answer is simple. We must do it because theCongress and the Department of Defense have not show<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>n<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> the courage to take those measures which in my view_andI think the view of the overwhelming majority of the American people_weneed to impose these efficiencies.I think the most important aspect of this issue is not whether we are goingto close a few bases or not<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> although they need to be closed. We need to senda message to the American people that we are serious about saving theirtax dollars, and I do not see a way we can do this unless we agree to whatis presently contained in the Senate Armed Services Committee bill beforeus. I understand it is also contained in the House bill.Mr. President, Oliver Cromwell once had the courage to close down a usel<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ss Parliament. He said at that time: ``They havesat here too long for the good they do here. It is time for them to goand return here no more.''Mr<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>. <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>President, it is time that our useless bases wentand return here no more. It is time, no matter whose State these basesare in, that we carry out our obligation to the American taxpayers. Itis time to impose maximum efficiencies across the board. It is time tosupport a bill that will give us an objective, unbiased, and supportabledecisionmaking process which will provide the efficiencies which the Americantaxpayers want and deserve.I want to again thank my colleague from Illinois for his honest commitmentand his deep concern abou<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> this issue. I know he is deeply concerned aboutthe impact of ba<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>e closings upon working men and women who have workedtheir entire lives in a certain State and certain area. I know he is alsounderstandabl<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>y<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> concerned about<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>the prospect of Draconian measur<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>s taking place, and bases being closed which cannever be replaced under normal circumstances. At the same time, I believe that i<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>f<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> this bil<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>l<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> is <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>nacted as presently written, we will have appointeda group of Americans who are eminently qualified to make these decisions,and I believe it is time we moved forward in addressing this very vitalissue.Mr<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>.<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> President, I yi<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ld the floor.The PRESIDING OFFICER.

It was also clear to me, as it has beenfor years, that the economy of the Tri-Cities, which surround the HanfordReservation, had become excessively dependent on the continued operationof the defense facilities located there. Recognizing the inevitable fateof the N-reactor, I sought to minimize the impact that closure would haveby requesting that the Defense Department's Office of Economic Adjustment_asmall b<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ut<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> effective organization designed to minimize theimpact of changes in defense spending on communities_get involved.

We were told back then that such a request was ``premature'' sinceno decision about the N-reactor had been made. Obviously, I disagreed.You shouldn't have to wait for a disaster to happen before you begin toplan for it. I renewed the request in January and again in February. Finally,I was told that DOD and DOE had agreed that it was a good idea. ``Betterlate than never,'' I thought.</ITAG>Since OEA became involved_and they are involved and being helpful_somehave suggested that it would be wise to clarify their right to offer assistanceto communities effected by changes in DOD facilities and the Hanford facilitybelongs to DOE. This is, in my mind, a minor problem since Hanford is designedto support a clear DOD mission and since both the Secretary of Defenseand the Secretary of Energy now support OEA involvement.Still, in an effort to clarify the issue, this amendment simply recognizesOEA's right to be involved at Hanford and authorizes DOE support for OEA'seffort there.I appreciate the cooperation of the chairman and his staff throughout theprocess of dealing with this issue. Again, I think the amendment is acceptableto the managers of the bill and I yield the floor.[S10MY8-148]{S5344}hanford de<ITAG tagnum="89">hanford deserves office of economic adjustment assistance</ITAG>[S10MY8-149]{S5344}EVANSMr. EVANS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague from theState of Washington, Senator <T4>Adams, </T4>in proposing this amendment. It will provide authorityto the Defense Department's Office of Economic Adjustment [OEA] to assistthe citizens of the communities surrounding the Hanford Nuclear Reservationto adjust to changed economic circumstances resulting from the decisionby the Department of Energy to close the N-reactor.For more than 20 years the Office of Economic Adjustment has provided assistanceto communities faced with the prospect of a military installation closure.The OEA serves a coordinating function by helping distressed communitiesidentify various sources of economic assistance and development aid thatwill help them convert what otherwise might be a severe economic jolt intoa positive shot in the arm.This amendment is necessary because current law authorizes OEA assistanceonly when an installation owned and operated by the Department of Defenseis shutdown or significantly realigned. The rationale for the law is thatcommunities which have sprung up to support military installations or whichhave come to depend on a military installation should not have to bearthe full brunt of a decision to terminate or greatly curtail military activityat the installation.Although it is not technically a military reservation, the Hanford complexproduces nuclear materials vital to maintaining our national security.Under longstanding policy, the Department of Energy_not the Departmentof Defense_operates all our defense nuclear production facilities. Accordingly,the rationale for the law which authorizes OEA support for closed DOD facilitieswould also support OEA assistance to communities affected by closure ofa DOE defense facility.Mr. President, much work needs to be done to help the Tri-Cities and othercommunities affected by the closure of the N-reactor. The goal is to saveas many jobs as possible through a combination of increased activity inother programs at the Hanford <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>R<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>eservation and creation of new employment opportunitiesthroughout the surrounding communities. OEA can help us reach that goal.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there any further debate on the amendment?

The Senator from Delaware.[S10MY8-154]{S5345}base conso<ITAG tagnum="89">base consolidation</ITAG>[S10MY8-155]{S5345}ROTHMr. ROTH. Mr. President, over the last several years, I have sought toplay a role in drawing the attention of the Senate and of the <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>p<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ublic to some of the <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>more<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> outrageous spending practices of the Departmentof Defense. My efforts, and those of my colleagues, have unearthed allenwrenches priced at almost $10,000, coffeepots for $7,600, and in one particularhilarious example, toilet seat covers for $640. At one stage, I was evenable to <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>decorate<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> an entire Christmas tree with expensive examplesof the carelessness of the Pentagon and the cupidity of several of ourmajor defense contractors.Some members of the Pentagon, confronted with these criticisms, decidedthat a good offense constituted the best defense. They sought to belittlethese efforts as demeaning and fundamentally unimportant. Well, Mr. Pre<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ident, I do not think that these efforts were, inany sense, minor or demeaning. They uncovered serious abuses of the taxpayers'money and I, for one, am proud of the role I played in holding the Pentagon'sfeet to the fire and demanding reform.However, let us face facts, if we are going to attack waste and abuse bythe Pentagon, we cannot turn a blind eye to waste that emanates here, inthis Chamber. We cannot assert that it is wrong for the Department of Defenseto waste taxpayers' money but it is fine for elected politicans to playfast and lose with the taxpayers' dollars.And let us face facts, this is exactly what we have been doing with militarybases. This Government has been maintaining a number of military facilitieswhich the <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Armed<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> Forces simpl<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>y<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> do not require and which the Department of Defensewishes to close. Let me repeat that for the benefit of my colleagues. Theseare savings which the Department of Defense wishes to make. That agencyof the Federal Government which so many of us have condemned as spendthriftwishes to make savings. The question before us now is only whether theCongress will stand in the way of such savings.How much money will be saved by allowing the Department of Defense to closeor consolidate its basing facilities? Of course, <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>no<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> one can answer that question with absolute certainty,because none of us know exactly how many bases should, or could, be closed.However, the Grace Commission said that a conservative estimate of potentialsavings amounted to at least $2 billion per year. Please note that thesesavings are not one-time savings, but annual savings and that the Commissionpointed out that, according to DOD and OMB analyses, annual savings couldbe much greater.Mr. President, we are not talking about a few savings here and a few savingsthere that may add up to some real money at the end of the day. We aretalking about real money up front, a minimum of $2 billion per year. Howcan we, in all conscience, pass by the opportunity to save $2 billion ayear in useless spending?I might point out that there are some who estimate that it would go ashigh as $5 billion.What is the mechanism by which such savings will be made? The mechanismis extremely important because the Congress should not, under any circumstances,risk allowing partisan politics to drift into the base consolidation issue.We do not want to run the risk of allowing a Republican administrationto target only bases in democratically held States and constituencies orvice versa. Nor do we wish to allow a Republican or Democratic administrationto play out base closing over a long period of time for political advantage.I believe that the mechanism which has been established after long consultationsbetween myself, Representative <T4>Armey, </T4>Senator <T4>Nunn, </T4>Senator <T4>Warner, </T4>Representative <T4>Aspin, </T4>and Secretary Carlucci truly solves this problem. I sincerelybelieve that this represents an honest, workable, bipartisan solution tothe base consolidation question.The Secretary of Defense already has appointed a nine-member Commissionon Base Consolidation headed by former Senator Ribicoff and former CongressmanJack Edwards. I have in my possession lists of other Commission membersif any <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>M<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ember wishes to see them.The legislation which we are considering here today empowers the Secretaryof Defense to act upon the recommendations of the Commission and lays downthe manner in which he may do so.First, and most important, the legislation provides that, if any consolidationsof closures are to take place, the Secretary of Defense must, within 15days of receipt of the Commission's report, himself report to the Congressthat he intends to accept all of the Commission's recommendations. I stress all, Mr. President, because the Secretary may not pick or chooseamong the Commission's recommendations. There is no danger of a Secretaryplaying politics here. He must accept the Commission's recommendationsas a whole or not at all.In addition, if the Secretary decides that closures are to be implemented,he may not drag them out for political purposes. Closures must be initiatedno later than September 10, 1991, and all must be completed no later thanSeptember 30, 1995. In other words, we are not giving carte blanche tothe Secretary of Defense. Rather, we are opening a window for a finiteperiod of time in order that the Secretary may carry out a specific taskwhich is vital to the security and the budgetary health of this Nation.When the task is completed, the window will be closed.The work will proceed promptly and, in my opinion, efficiently. The C<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>o<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>mmission must report its findings to the Secretaryno late<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>r<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> than December 31, 1988, and, as I mentioned earlier,the Secretary then has 15 days within which to decide whether or not toaccept all of its recommendations.I do not believe that this strict timetable i<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> unrealistic. The Department of Defense already hasthe necessary data on the financial position of its various bases and theroles they play, or do not play, in the preservation of U.S. national security.In short, I believe that the Commission can meet this deadline and turnin a top quality analysis.The formulators of this initiative are fully aware that some local communitiescan be negatively impacted by the closure of military facilities. Consequently,this legislation allows the Secretary of Defense <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>to<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> make economic adjustment assistance available toimpacted communities.I suspect that some of my colleagues are particu<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>l<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>arly concerned about the local impact of a base closing.I would commend to their attention an editorial in the Wall Street Journalof M<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ay<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> 4, 1988. The editorial points out the example ofthe closure of Kincheloe Air Force Base in Michigan in 1977. When the closureof the base went ahead, local residents feared the loss of the 650 civilianjobs which the base provided. Today, the former base i<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> the site <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>of <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>an air/industrial park and provides three times morejobs than did the former Air Force <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>b<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ase.I would also draw my colleagues attention to the 1981 report of the President'sEconomic Adjustment Committee on completed military base economic adjustmentprojects between 1961 and 1981. The <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Economic<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> Adjustment Committee assisted local communitiesto adjust to the economic impact of base closings and, in my opinion, hasbeen remarkably successful. Former military bases have been successfullyconverted for productive civilian uses such as airports, schools, hospitals,recreational areas<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> and industr<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>i<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>al parks.Of the 94 military base economic adjustment projects, the committee madethe following interesting findings. 87,703 former DOD or contractor jobslost through closure were replaced by more than 123,000 civilian jobs.<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>109,262<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> of these are new jobs; over 14,515 jobs were relocatedfrom the impacted local communities to improved sites on the former bases.Eight 4-year colleges, 28 postsecondary vocational technical institutesor community colleges<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> and 11 high school vo-tech programs have been establishedat former bases. 46,000 college and postsecondary students, over 29,000secondary vo-tech<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> and over 8,000 trainees are now receiving educationand training at 50 former defense bases.<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Sixty-eight<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> of the defense bases closed between 1961 and 1981are now the sites of industrial parks or plants.The committee concludes it<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> findings by informing us:[S10MY8-156]{S5346}<ITAG tagnum="21">The transition period, often 2-3 years, in securing new civilian usescan be difficult for many communities. Yet, the experience of communitiesaffected by earlier base realignments clearly indicates that communitiescan successfully adjust to such dislocation.</ITAG>The adjustment experience is aptly summarized in an April 27, 1979, ChicagoTribune editorial:[S10MY8-157]{S5346}<ITAG tagnum="21">If cities are not resistant to the utmost the loss of the local militarypayroll, they need to hear the message that more diversified, stable, andeconomically valuable civilian payrolls not only may but do follow thedeparture of the military payroll.</ITAG>When, and if, the Secretary decides to act upon the recommendations ofthe Commission and a particular piece of property is determined to be availablefor sale, the <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Secretary<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> of Defense shall first inform other Federal instrumentalitiesof the availability of the property and, if offers are received, the propertyshall be sold to these instrumentalities at fair market value, if all thenecessary funding will be available within a reasonable period of time.If no fair market value offers are received, the Secretary may convey DODproperty to Federal agencies at less than fair market value if DOD can,nonetheless, prove that this course of action will produce savings. Inaddition, property may be conveyed to State or local governments at lessthan market value if the property in question is to be used for airport,education, or health purposes in accordance with a State or local reuseplan.Mr. President, surely we all recognize that we are going to have to dosomething about the expense of U.S. military bases.

Today, the base is knownas the Chippewa County Air/Industrial Park, and it provides more than threetimes the jobs formerly provided by Kincheloe. The apprehensions of theChippewa County residents and their congressmen proved unfounded.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Kincheloe was one of the last major military bases to be closed inthe U.S. For all the wailing in Congress about the defense budget, repeatedattempts to close expensive, redundant bases have failed. Defense expertsestimate that at least 10% of the nation's 900 major military bases couldbe shut. Congress won't allow it. Indeed the law that effectively preventsany such closures now is the handiwork of one of those Washington monumentswho frequently has the word ``respected'' inserted in front of his name_SenatorWilliam Cohen of Maine.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A 1977 law sponsored by Senator Cohen to thwart the closing of hisstate's Loring Air Force Base requires prior ``environmental'' and economicimpact studies. As veterans of the Environmental Protection Act know, thesestudies are basically a trampoline for extended litigation. So the Pentagondecided to let the Congressmen and their moribund pet bases alone.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">It now appears, however, that all the stars in Washington's astrologicalsky currently are aligned in a way that makes closing the bases a possibility.Texas Congressman Dick Armey and Delaware Senator William Roth have madelegislative proposals to close the most unnecessary bases. ``We no longerneed to guard the Pony Express routes to the Wild West,'' Senator Rothsays. ``We no longer need to maintain moated forts to guard against assaultby British sailing ships.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">One key to the Armey and Roth measures is that they allow an outsideforce to impose a discipline and responsibility of purpose on Congressthat individual members have found impossible to assume themselves. Ittakes the decision of what bases to close out the hands of Congress orthe Executive and places it with a bipartisan nine-member commission tobe appointed by Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci. The commission will lookat bases around the country and make recommendations of which 15 to 25bases should be closed between 1991 and 1995. The Secretary of Defensecan either approve the closings or reject them, but he cannot pick andchoose bases from the list. This is meant to avoid charges of partisanship.For its part, Congress would waive the current onerous requirements forbase closings, but would reserve the right to rescind a particular closingwith a majority vote.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">If all this happens, it will save between $2 billion and $5 billionannually. The Armey-Roth device is yet one more example of officials inWashington offloading onto a ``commission'' the responsibilities they arepresumably elected to exericse themselves.

But to give Congress any realcontrol over the mechanism under consideration would, in my jud<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>gm<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ent, be unconstitutional.As my colleagues will recall, Congress also wanted greater control overthe execution of our Federal election laws, a very sensitive matter, indeed.But in Buckley versus Valeo the Supreme Court held unconstitutional theCongressional effort to place Members on a commission with a duty to carryout laws. The Court held that this violated the appointments clause_articleII, S2, clause 2_of the Constitution which states how officers of the UnitedStates are to be appointed and excludes Congress from participating inthat process.In Buckley versus Valeo, Congress tried to place Members on the FederalElection Commission to make sure it did the ``right'' thing. Here, theamendment would place congressional Members on the Base Closing Commissionfor the same reason. To me, the two situations are constitutionally indistinguishable.The actions of the Base Closing Commission have legal effect, binding theUnited States. Their actions will allow certain statutory requirementsto be waived. Therefore, their actions are not merely advisory. Since theiractions have binding effect, the actors_the members_must be appointed inconformity with the appointments clause. Thus Congress may not place Memberson the Commission, and for that reason the amendment must be rejected.I yield the floor.[S10MY8-168]{S5347}F<ITAG tagnum="66">F</ITAG>[S10MY8-169]{S5347}TRADE BILL<ITAG tagnum="81">TRADE BILL CONFERENCE REPORT CORRECTIONS</ITAG>[S10MY8-170]{S5347}THURMONDMr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.[S10MY8-171]{S5347}BYRDMr. BYRD addressed the Chair.The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The conference report on H.R.3 had certain provisions in it which I think can correctly be consideredto be discriminatory toward Alaska and also, which at least on the surfaceof those provisions, appear to be unconstitutional. These provisions haveto do with shipments of oil and refining of oil in and by the State ofAlaska.The House <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ha<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>s taken action to correct the enrollment of the conferencereport on the trade bill, and those corrections would remove these offendingprovisions from the conference report.The President, when he has in<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>di<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>cated that he is going to veto the trade bill, hascited the provisions that pertain to Alaska as being one of the problemsthat he has with the trade bill, and so the House has attempted to meetthe President's objections in this respect by eliminating through thisconcurrent resolution these offending provisions. The concurrent resolution<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ha<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>s come over to the Senate, and I will shortly askuna<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>n<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>imous consent that the Senate proceed to the considerationof the concurrent resolution. I do this hoping that the Senate will bein a position to take the same ac<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ti<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>on as the House has taken to remove these offendingprovisions from the trade bill, so that when it reaches the President'sdesk, hopefully soon, and undoubtedly it will be soon, these provisionswould not be a part of the bill and to that extent we w<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>o<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>uld have removed that objection which the Presidenthas voiced. There was considerable discussion of these provisions at the time the conferencereport was before the Senate.I stated at that time that I sympathized with the Senators from Alaskaw<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>h<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>o were very opposed to these provisions, and I alsostated at that time tha<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> I agreed with them that the provisions were discriminatorytoward Alaska and, at least on the surface, would appear to be unconstitutional.The distinguished Republican leader and I have discussed this matter. Heis on the floor, and I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, that the Senateproceed to the immediate consideration of House Concurrent Resolution 293,making corrections in the enrollment of the conference report on the tradebill H.R. 3.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?[S10MY8-173]{S5348}DOLEMr. DOLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and as I have indicatedto the distinguished majority leader, I will be constrained to o<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>bj<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ect because I have a number of requests to do so.But as a matter of making a record, in the event there is no objection,and the concurrent resolution is then before the Senate, would it thenbe fully amendable?The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Both the motion to proceed and the resolution willbe fully debatable.[S10MY8-176]{S5348}DOLEMr. DOLE. Mr. President, under the reservation, I know there are a numberof provisions that have been called to my attention, one dealing with ethanol,importing ethanol, which has an adverse impact on our dom<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>es<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>tic industry and agriculture in particular in Stateslike Illinois, Iowa, and others, and will be opening up another loopholeof <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>th<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>e CBOI.There are many of my colleagues who would like to strike that provisionfrom the trade bill.There are other provisions dealing with creation of new ag<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>en<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>cies, studies, a list of seven or eight that havebeen called to my attention. As I understand, they would all have thatopportunity if there is no objection. If there is objection, is it correctthat the res<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ol<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ution would then go to the Banking Committee?The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. If enrolled, the resolutionwould go to the Banking Committee.[S10MY8-177]{S5348}DOLEMr. DOLE. I think I know the answer. But to make the record, is there anyrequirement that the Banking Committee take action on the resolution?The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no requirement for the Banking Committeeto take action.[S10MY8-178]{S5348}DOLEMr. DOLE. If no action is taken, what happens then to the conference reporton the trade bill? Can that be sent to the President or do we have to waituntil action is taken on the concurrent resolution?The PRESIDING OFFICER. The trade bill can be sent to the President andit is not dependent on action on the concurrent resolution.[S10MY8-179]{S5348}DOLEMr. DOLE. In the concurrent resolution itself, are there any correctionsto the conference report, technical corrections, other than the eliminationof the so-called Alaska provisions? Are there other corrections in theresolution?The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the only correction that the Chair is awareof.[S10MY8-180]{S5348}DOLEMr. DOLE. T<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>he<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> question I guess would be whether or not that wasa technical correction, but there are no other apparently technical correctionsin the conference report. Is it correct then to assume that the BankingCommittee would never take action, the conference report would go to thePresident, he has indicated he will veto the conference report, then itcomes back to the Congress, and we would then act on the veto?In other words, I guess what I am sugge<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>st<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ing is on<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ce<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> an objection is made, and the concurrent resolutiongoes to the committee, that could be the end. It probably would be theend.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.[S10MY8-181]{S5348}DOLEMr. DOLE. The majority leader may have further comme<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>nt<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>s. I would interpose an objection at this time.The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. <T4>Pell</T4>). Objection is heard.[S10MY8-182]{S5348}BYRDMr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Republican leader. Ithink that he has performed a service in the course of the parliamentaryinquiries, laying into the<T4> Record</T4> the various ramifications of an objection to the request.The correction that would be made would be a substantive correction. Itreally does not conform to the definition of a technical correction. Thatis the reason the matter is not privileged and would go to the BankingCommittee.As the distinguished Republican leader has also made clear for the<T4> Record,</T4> this resolution, if it were called up before the Senate,would be subject to amendments, and that could involve quite a bit of timeas the Senate proceeds to work its way through various and sundry amendmentsthat would be offered on this resolution.The purpose of making the request and in seeking to get the resolutionbefore the Senate, of course, is to then, hopefully, get some kind of agreementthat would allow the offending provisions to be dealt with without theSenate's having to deal with other amendments.If the House were to send over the enrolled conference report or bill tomorrow,then it wo<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>u<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ld be a matter for the Vice President or the Presidentpro tempore or the Acting President pro tempore to sign, whereupon themeasure would then go back to the originating House, the other body, whichwould then send the measure down to the President.It is anticipated that that measure will be going down to the Presidentwithin the next day or so, during this week, whereupon at midnight of theday it reaches the White House, the 10 days under the Constitution, excludingSundays, will begin to run and end with midnight of the 10th day.I think what is obvious here is that if this resolution were called upat the moment and we could not get unanimous consent to limit amendmentsto it, it would be around for several days, and we would have the wholetrade debate or at least a good bit of it right here on the floor all overagain.The point I am trying to make here is that the President should not vetothis bill. He ought to sign this bill. There is no question but that hehas the right and the prerogative, the authority, and the power to vetoit. There are those who say that if the President vetoes this bill, itcould make a quick turnaround and the offending provisions to the President,to wit plant closings, could simply be eliminated and the bill could bequickly stripped down and sent back to the President.It is obvious that while the House may be able to give the bill a quickturnaround, in the Senate where the rules are different, we can expectSenators to call up the same amendments they called up before. Our timeis growing short. There are 78 day<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> of session left in this session.<CODE-213>5</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><ITAG tagnum="80">We have to dispose of all the other measures that are i<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>n<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>cumbent upon us befor<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>1</CODE-213> the adjournment date which I hope will be no laterthan October 8. </ITAG>So here is an effort to <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>re<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>move the offending provisions.

I close by saying again that I hope that the President will not veto thisbill and that those Senators who really want to see trade legislation enactedwill consider very carefully their vote when the time comes to vote onthe override of a veto. I hope the President will still see the light andnot veto this trade bill. But if that happens, what has transpired heretoday should underscore the difficulties that will arise in any effortto strip away certain provisions from the trade bill and send a new tradebill to the White House.Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Republican leader for his objection.He was constrained to object for the reasons he has stated, because thereare Senators on his side who would want to offer amendments to this res<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>o<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>lution if it were called up.

Mr. President, I will take 1 minute.I certainly have agreement with nearly everything the distinguished majorityleader has said. But I do know that the Senator from Iowa [Mr. <T4>Grassley</T4>], for example, if there were no objection, would be herewith an ethanol amendment. He has already made an inquiry.I know of others who would be here with amendments. Some would be herewith an amendment on plant closing<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>, to strike that provision. Some would be here withamendments with respect to transferring authority of the U.S. Trade Representative.I think the majority leader correctly underscores that if there were noobjection, we would have a full-scale trade debate here, probably for days.That may portend what will happen if there is a veto. I am not suggestingthat would happen. It seems to me that the issue is clearly drawn. Theconference report, according to the majority leader, now will go to thePresident, within 2 or 3 days. The President will take whatever actionhe should take within 10 days. Then Congress and the administration willbe faced with a larger question: Should we make an effort to have anothertrade bill this year?I believe there is a genuine interest in passing trade legislation on bothsides of the aisle and in the White House, and I believe that we have takenappropriate action by objecting to this request.I thank the distinguished majority leader.[S10MY8-184]{S5349}BYRDMr. BYRD.

At thetime, I was a member of the Armed Services Committee, as I am today. Iwas also a member of the Democratic Party which I am not today. The chairmanof the House Armed Services Committee was a fellow South Carolina<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>n<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> named L. Mendel Rivers.

We have had up the question of baseclosures in the Armed Service<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> Committee in the Senate for many years. And Congressmenhave been reluctant to pass such a measure unless the Members of Congressare on the Commission that acts on the matter. But in my opinion, it wouldbe unconstitutional to have Congressmen who are supposed to make the lawunder the Constitution on the Commission which is to execute the law, andI feel it would be a mistake to have them on there.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Now, if we do not pass this type bill where the Secretaryof Defense has the right to accept all of these recommendations or none,what kind of bill <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>c<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>an we pass? When will we ever get a type of legislationthat would get results?<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Now the Secretary of Defense has appointed a Commissionof very able people to make recommendations, people who are fair, reasonable,just, and in my opinion, unbiased.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>He has appointed former Senator Abe Ribicoff, whosat in this Senate for years and for whom we all have great respect.

On the other hand, we do have manybases that can be dispensed with.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>I believe it was pointed out here this morning byone of the speakers that one report says we could save $2 billion a yearif we closed unnecessary bases.

I strongly support this provision, and would like tocommend the Committee for its leadership on this matter.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Substantial financial savings could be realized if the Departmentof Defense could close or realign certain marginal military bases. However,there are substantial political and legal barriers making it virtuallyimpossible for us to do so. After consulting with Congressional leadership,and with the leadership of the Armed Services Committees, I establisheda Bipartisan Commission on Base Closures and Realignments. This Commissionis chaired by former Senator Abe Ribicoff (D-CT) and former CongressmanJack Edwards (R-AL), and it consists of seven other distinguished Americans.This Commission will report its recommendations to me by December 31, 1988.Since I view this as an issue of great importance, and because of the politicalsensitivities involved, I have reluctantly agreed to give up my own discretionregarding the Commission's recommendations beyond adopting or rejectingtheir entire package.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In parallel with the Commission's work, I am initiating a review ofour overseas bases to determine if efficiencies can be realized throughclosures or realignments in our overseas base structure.

Continueinvestment in marginal military bases diverts limited resources from-othervital projects. While I recognize the political sensitivities involved,I strongly urge the Senate to support the Commission's action.</ITAG>That is signed by Frank Carlucci.Mr. President, I just want to say that everybody, I think, recognize<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> that steps should be taken to close some of thesebases, some of these forts, or some of these camps or stations. But differentpeople have different ideas: some feel they might retain a base in a certainState if we follow a certain course.But here is a procedure, here is a plan that outsiders come in, able people,people who are familiar with defense. You have got on this committee peoplewho understand defense and you have got other prominent people on here,former Members of Congress, former Senators and House Members and others.They can approach this from a viewpoint that I believe no Members of Congresscan hardly do, because most of us feel we have a duty to our States totry to help our States will we can. Whereas this Commission will view thisin a different light and can approach it in a way that will be best forour Nation.I have seen many efforts to close these bases, as I stated. But they havebeen fruitless. This is a plan that we feel can get results. This is aplan that is fair and reasonable.I would urge the Members of the Senate to pass this provision in the SenateArmed Services authorization bill as we have brought it out of committee.I do not think it is wise to adopt the amendment of the able Senator fromIllinois; again, I say, for whom I have great respect. But I am convincedthat we ought to adopt this plan that has been recommended here by theSecretary of Defense. The membership of the committee has gotten able,prominent people to serve.

This year's markup proceeded more smoothly thanany other in which I have been involved in my 6 years on the committee.The Senator from Georgia and the Senator from Virginia can be justly proudof the result that has come from the deliberations of the committee.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Mr. President, I would like to concentrate my remarkstoday on the actions taken by the committee in the areas within the jurisdictionof the Defense Industry and Technology Subcommittee, which I chair andon which Senator <T4><CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Gr<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>amm </T4>serves very ably as ranking member. Thoseactions were focused primarily in four areas.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Strengthening our defense technology base; strengtheningour defense industrial base; dealing with the complexities of defense tradeand cooperation with our allies; and improving our defense acquisitionsystem.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>In essence, my subcommittee has been chartered bythe chairman of the full committee, Senator <T4>Nunn</T4>, to take a long-term view of our defense needs and to ensurethat our policies in these areas are compatible with one another and contributeto our overall national security strategy. Of course, a key element ofthat strategy is to rely on our technological and industrial capacity toproduce qualitatively superior weaponry to offset the quantitative advantagesour potential adversaries continue to have.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>The subcommittee continued efforts begun last yearto develop policies for sustaining and strengthening the Nation's defenseindustrial and technological bases.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Building on last year's hearings, the subcommitteethis <ITAG tagnum="80">year examined trad<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>eo<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ffs in defining policies for our technological andindustrial bases. We were especially interested in policy decisions affectingthe defense acquisition system that strengthen quality, encourage innovationand ris<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>k t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>aking, provide a framework for working with <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>our <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>allies, where possible, and speed the insertion ofadvanced technology into deployed weapons systems_including those of ourallies.</ITAG>Last year, we took several steps to more closely couple our defense industrialand technology base programs. We continue to believe the linkage betweenthe industrial base and our technological strength must be understood andsupported. Throughout the subcommittee's hearings, witnesses stressed theneed to establish policies that recognize the U.S. defense industrial baseas a national asset.Our hearings and our review of the budget request revealed a continuingerosion in our defense technology base as a result of funding shortfallsin recent years. In addition, testimony provided evidence that the independentresearch and development [IRandamp;D] programs of industry have sufferedfrom congressionally imposed caps on IRandamp;D and bid and proposal costs_andthe problem for IRandamp;D has been made worse by growing bid and proposalcosts in an increasingly competitive environment. To address the fundingproblem, the subcommittee has proposed modest increases in funding forcertain technology base program.This funding included an addition of $130.5 million to the Defense AdvancedResearch Projects Agency for research in such areas as concurrent design,high temperature superconductivity, gallium arsenide integrated circuittechnology, materials, and so<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ft<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ware development. We also added $55 million to theadministration's $45 million request for Sematech. As will be seen, manyof these programs focus on manufacturing technology in critical areas.We feel that DARPA is uniquely suited to tying our defense technology baseand manufacturing technology programs together in a coherent fashion.In addition, I should also note that we increased funding for universityresearch programs by $50 million to a total of $145 million. We think thisprogram has produced a wealth of innovative research and has helped torecouple our universities to our defense needs.Finally, the subcommittee continued previous efforts to correct an imbalancein the defense research program through<ITAG tagnum="80">the balanced technology initiative. This program is designed to produceleap-frog conventional technologies that can be <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>r<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>apidly fielded. The subcommittee recommended an authorizationof $100 million above the budget request for the balanced technology initiative.This authorization is to provide for new programs in fiscal year 1989,and will provide <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>total authorization for BTI of $338 million in fiscalyear 1989.</ITAG>With respect to the defense industrial base, witnesses before the subcommitteestressed that erosion of capability in our manufacturing sector is widespreadand amply demonstrated by trade statistics in manufacturing and high technologyproducts. Even in the defense area, where the U.S. defense Randamp;D investmentis considerably greater than the combined investment of our NATO and Japaneseallies, the trends are adverse. The hearings lead to the conclusion that foreign governments, includingour allies, pu<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>r<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>sue protectionist defense industrial base and defensetrade policies that result in an inefficient use of alliance defense resources.These governments use their monopsony power and the U.S. commitment toalliance defense to extract offset, technology transfer, and counter-tradearrangements from individual U.S. firms seeking to do business with them.The hearings also pointed to a clear trend toward internationalizationof the Western defense industry. The subcommittee concluded that the United States is ill-prepared to dealwith these problems, that our defense industrial base and defense tradepolicies appear unfocused, and that the Defense Department needs to definerealistic industrial base goals in the context of our national securitystrategy and likely military scenarios. The Manufacturing Technology [Mantech] Program is an area of very highpayoff. Yet, with the eception of the Air Force, the services do not funda robust Mantech Program and the Office of the Secretary of Defense hasnot exercised a strong leadership role vis-a-vis the services in this regard.As the committee noted last year<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>:<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>[S10MY8-195]{S5351}<ITAG tagnum="21">Additional funding and centralized oversight are needed within theOffice of the Secretary of Defense to develop a defense industrial strategythat coherently integrates defense industry and the technology base withinthe context of our international economic and defense policies.</ITAG>This statement remains valid.<CODE-213>5</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>In terms of funding, the subcommittee sought to stress the linkage betweenresearch and manufacturing technology by clearly identifying as manufacturingtechnology $106 million of the $130.5 million for DARPA I previously discussed.In addition to funding, the subcommittee has included several policy-relatedprovisions that will affect the industrial base. One of these provisionsdirects the Defense Department to establish a policy on offsets, and toenter into bilateral and multilateral negotiations with the goal of eventuallyeliminating such arrangements. Another provision is included that requirescertification by the department that a memorandum of understanding is inthe security interests of the United States when that memorandum of understandinginvolves offsets.We are also recommending a provision that requires the department to analyze,in a limited number of cases, the capability of the U.S. defense industrialbase to support designated acquisition programs. And we have included languagespecifically intended to focus attention on the industrial base. This languagewill establish a Defense Production Innovation Center in the Defense Department;provide for increased reliance on commercial manufacturing processes; andprovide authorization for assistance in exporting defense-related products.There is also a provision that will ensure that the Department of Defenseroutinely consults with the Department of Commerce on the negotiation ofMOU's with our allies on defense trade, cooperation on defense research,and production of defense equipment. The Secretary of Defense is directedto work with the Secretary of Commerce on implementation of these MOU'sand to report on the effect of each MOU on our industrial base.As our committee's report notes:[S10MY8-196]{S5351}<ITAG tagnum="21">This (previous) lack of interagency consultation within the U.S. Governmentcan lead to the perception, if not the reality, that U.S. economic interests,and in particular, the effects on the U.S. defense industrial base, arenot given great enough weight in these negotiations.</ITAG>I should note that the committee is paying particular attention to thenegotiation of the FSX/F-16 MOU with Japan and we have included directionsin our report to the effect that the U.S. Government should ensure a meaningfulworkshare for U.S. industry on co-development and co-production of the<ITAG tagnum="80">FSX airframe and technology flowback to the United States before anydetailed F-16 technical data receives an export license.</ITAG>The committee has also expressed concern more broadly in the report aboutwasteful duplication of defense Randamp;D among the United States and itsallies. We are particularly concerned in the area of fighter aircraft whereno less than six aircraft are currently entering development_Agile Falcon,F-16, Hornet 2000_F-18, ATF, European Fighter Aircraft, French Rafale,and Japanese FSX. If all six are carried through to production, the resultis likely to be inefficient production rates for most, if not all, of themin the late 1990's. Each of these programs may make sense in terms of eachindividual nation's defense industrial policies, but they are terriblywasteful of alliance resources. We end up doing duplicative Randamp;D andproducing inefficien<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>tl<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>y, while the Soviets spend less and produce moreaircraft. To break this cycle the committee has continued its strong supportfor NATO cooperative Randamp;D programs, usually termed Nunn programs inhonor of o<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>u<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>r chairman, and we have urged both the United Statesand our allies to show greater willingness to share emerging technologyin these cooperative programs under appropriate security arrangements.The subcommittee's major effort this year, however, was focused on acquisitionpolicies and management. In the subcommittee's hearings, we heard repeatedreferences to the hostile relationship between Government and industry.Witnesses from both Government and industry agreed that this was a significantproblem that needed to be addressed.In an effort to promote a constructive dialog between Government and industry,last year Senator <T4>Gramm </T4>and I established an ``<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>d hoc defense industry advisory group'' to identifyproblems and recommend solutions. The advisory group identified a numberof issues and submitted a report early this year, which was circulatedwidely to provide the subcommittee with a broad range of views. Senator<T4>Gramm, </T4>Senator <T4>Dixon, </T4>Senator <T4>Wirth </T4>and I then introduced a legislative package, S. 2254, theDefense Industry and Technology Act, on March 31 and this was reviewedin depth during the subcommittee's oversight hearings.Based upon the advisory group's report, the numerous comments submittedon the report from both the public and private sectors, and the testimonyreceived during the subcommittee's oversight hearings, several generalthemes emerged.First, people are the key to the effectiveness of the acquisition process,and we must give priority at<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ention to enhancing the quality of the procurementworkforce. Second, the acquisition process is beset by cumbersome and contradictorypolicies that act as a disincentive to innovation and produce delay infielding new weapons systems. Third, to achieve significant sa<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>vi<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ngs in defense expenditures, DOD must focus its attentionon costs, which is the major component of contract prices, rather thanon profit. Fourth, Government and industry must work together to fostera sense of trust and confidence in an environment that establishes clearlines of respons<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>i<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>bility and firm procedures for accountability. Fifth,acquisition changes often have be<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>n justified in terms of addressing isolated elementsof procurement policy without regard to the system-wide impact of suchchanges. Finally, the acquisition system is suffering from regulatory overloadas a result of the demanding task of implementing numerous legislativeand internal changes in recen<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>years.Although we believe the system must be allowed to fully digest recent changesbefore undertaking major system-wide inovations at this time, we are recommendinga number of modific<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>tions to address these issues without placing anundue burden on either government or industry. These provisions are includedin the bill reported last week.They cover a variety of areas, which I will briefly enumerate. I have broughtalong a copy of the draft report language on these provisions and willbe happy to leave that with you.The acquisition provisions include:First, a requ<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>i<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>rement for the Secretary of De<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>fen<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>se to develop an integrated financing pol<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ic<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>y;Second, limitations on fixed price development contracts;Third, a process for regulatory simplification and streamlining of oversightactivities;Fourth, allowability of foreign selling costs to the extent provided inadvance agreements;Fifth, a 40-hour work week standard for bid and evaluation purposes onprofessional and technical service contracts; andSixth, incentives for innovation exclusively at private expense.Senator <T4>Gramm</T4> and I believe that the advisory group process has workedwell. We are indebted to John Rittenhouse of General Electric/RCA who chairedthe group and to the other members of the group. We hope that we have setin place a process that will continue to help heal an acquisition systemthat is clearly not working very well at present.Mr. President, these then are th<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>issues with which we have been attempting to deal.In general, I am pleased with the results of the committee's deliberations.We have transferred resources from other defense programs to better meetour technology base and industrial base needs. We have begun to come togrips with defining rational defense industrial base and defense tradepolicies. We have made what I hope will be regarded as a constructive contributionto reforming our acqu<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>i<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>sition system with greater emphasis on quality, innovation,and timeliness in the process.Mr. President, before concluding I want to take this opportunity to thankthe other members of the subcommittee for their hard work and constructivecontributions on these issues. Senator <T4>Gramm </T4>has made major contributions to the acquisition portionsof the bill and strongly supports the need to strengthen our technologybase. On industrial base and defense trade issues, Senator <T4>Dixon </T4>has ably focused attention on the lack of coherence in ourpolicies and the need for change. This is an area that the subcommitteewill spend a great deal more time on in the coming year. Senator <T4>Wirth</T4> has taken an active role in all aspects of the subcommittee'swork. He is a strong advocate for our defense technology base and for adefense acquisition system that focuses more on quality, timeliness, andinnovation than it does at present.Mr. President, as we<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>all know, good staff work is the underpinning ofall good legislation. Senator <T4>Gramm </T4>and I are deeply indebted to several members of the ArmedServices Committee staff who have worked tirelessly to put meat on thebones of our legislative agenda. Kent Bankus, Andy Effron, Jon Etherton,John Wildfong, Rick Finn, and Judy Freedman have worked together constructivelyto provide suggestions and to frame issues for the members. I have alsorelied a great deal on Ed McGaffigan of my personal staff to help sortout the options for action. Without these dedicated professionals, we wouldnot have made the progress we have made in this legislation toward sounderpublic policy in these vital areas.Mr. President, let me conclude by once again commending the chairman andranking member of the Armed Services Committee for their leadership onthis bill. I want to thank them for all their supp<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>o<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>rt as the committee dealt with the complex issueswithin my subcommittee's jurisdiction. I would urge all my colleagues tosupport the bill.

Mr. President, we are now engaged in a negotiation on the baseclosure amendments that have been proposed. While it may appear the Senateis not conducting business at the moment, I suggest that we may very wellbe saving literally hours of time because we have at least three or four,possibl<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>y<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> five or six, of these amendments that are goingto be presented. Each one is going to require an hour or two of debate.If we can work out this overall package and overall approach, we probablywill save 4, 5, or 6 hours.In the meantime, we are prepared to take other amendments. This base closurepackage may take a few more minutes, an hour, or may take 2 hours. We areprepared to debate amendments. All Members should be aware we need to getamendments on the floor. We have a long list of amendments to be takenup, and I hope that the staff who are listening to the Senate deliberationswill inform the Senators, and the <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>S<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>enators who are listening will determine if theycan come over and present amendments on this bill.We know of at least 30 amendments. We know we are trying to get throughthis bill this week. We know there are at least 10 major amendments. Weare talking to Members about scheduling those amendments this afternoon,tomorrow, and Thursday. We have an outside chance of finishing this billon Thursday evening, if we are able to get Members to come over in an expeditiousfas<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>h<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ion and present their amendments.But I request that any Member who has an amendment now be prepared to bringit over and let us know about it.

The Senator from South Dakota.[S10MY8-230]{S5354}PRESSLERMr. PRESSLER. Let me say that I hope my good friend sees fit to put myamendment in order because I think it is very important that the Commissionhave the authority to consider military bases worldwide. My amendment merelystrikes ``inside the United States.'' It also would strike the sectionwhich provides for the conduct of a study of overseas installations.My feelings are very strong that the Commission should have the authorityto deal with the closure of bases on a worldwide basis. I have just returnedin a delegation headed by Senator <T4>Dole,</T4> visiting some of our bases in various countries. It is entirelypossible that one of those countries will ask us to leave or somethingwill happen, so that we will decide to relocate a base in the United States.There are two or three countries where that is being threatened and thereis one country where it is happening.I am not necessarily advocating this, but I do think we have to look atthis base closure issue on a worldwide basis. Also, I think we need toconsider whether or not some of the bases overseas should not be relocatedin our own country to stimulate our own economy.What this bill does, as drafted, is to limit the Commission that is consideringbase closure <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>in<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> the United States. It says that,[S10MY8-231]{S5354}<ITAG tagnum="21">A statement certifying that the Commission has identified the militaryinstallations to be closed or realigned after reviewing all military installationsinside the United States, including all military installations under constructionand all military installations planned for construction.</ITAG>Then it <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>g<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>oes on to deal with the bases overseas by saying,[S10MY8-232]{S5354}<ITAG tagnum="21">The Secretary shall conduct a study of actions planned with respectto military installations of the United States outside the United Stateswhich may affect the recommendations of the Commission, and shall no laterthan September 15, 1988, transmit a report of the findings and conclusionsof such study to the Commission and to the appropriate committees of Congress.</ITAG>In other words, this is merely another study, and I think one thing thatwe have in Washington is a plethora of studies. But the good thing aboutthe Commission is that, as I understand it, it has the power to mandatethe closure of certain facilities that are considered inefficient or consideredunnecessary.As I mentioned I have just come back from discussions in Greece, Turkey,and Portugal, three of the countries that have U<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>nited <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>S<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>tates<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> bases. I predict that there is a very good chance_Ihope it does not happen_that we may be asked or we may decide to lessenour presence in some countries overseas.Indeed, I do not know what will happen in the Philippines, for example.I hope<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>our bases are there for a long time because we needthem. But let us just envisage a situation where the Philippine Governmentat some future time were to ask us to leave; we would have to leave. Whatwould we do? We would try to relocate elsewhere. It may be that we wouldhave to relocate in the United States. It may be that we just closed abase in the United States and we would have to relocate one here from abroad.The point I am making here is that this legislation says we are not reallyserious<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ly<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> considering closing any bases overseas. We are limitingthe Commission's authority to inside the United States.My amendment merely strikes ``inside the United States.'' Then the Commissioncould take a worldwide approach.[S10MY8-233]{S5354}WARNERMr. WARNER. Madam President, could I ask a question? The effect of youramendment would be to put on a parallel status, overseas installationswith domestic installations, as provided in law, with respect to the dutiesof the Commission; is that correct?[S10MY8-234]{S5354}PRESSLERMr. PRESSLER. Let me say that I very much appreciate the interest of theranking member because he is so knowledgeable in these areas. The effectof my amendment would be to strike ``inside the United States.''Therefore, the law would read:[S10MY8-235]{S5354}<ITAG tagnum="21">A statement certifying that the Commission has identified the militaryinstallations to be closed or realigned after reviewing all military installationsincluding all military installations under construction and all militaryinstallations planned for construction.</ITAG>Thus, the Commission would take a worldwide view.[S10MY8-236]{S5354}WARNERMr. WARNER. I think for the benefit of the Senators and staff members listeningto the debate, essentially what your amendment would do is put on a parallelstatus overseas installations with domestic installations.[S10MY8-237]{S5354}PRESSLERMr. PRESSLER. I do not know if parallel<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>is the right word. They would be within the sameauthority.[S10MY8-238]{S5354}WARNERMr. WARNER. The Commission could act on overseas installations in the samemanner it could on domestic.[S10MY8-239]{S5354}PRESSLERMr. PRESSLER. That is correct.[S10MY8-240]{S5354}WARNERMr. WARNER. As they conduct their work, they would have a coequal responsibilityto look inside America and outside America.[S10MY8-241]{S5354}PRESSLERMr. PRESSLER. That is my general intention, yes.[S10MY8-242]{S5354}WARNERMr. WARNER. I thank the Senator.[S10MY8-243]{S5354}PRESSLERMr. PRESSLER. Let me state the reason for that. According to my thinkingat least, and based on the discussions we had with leaders in these countries,it was emphasized to us that we are there as the guests of those countries.Indeed, some installations even <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>have <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>a commander from the country. There is political turbulence in some of the countries where we have bases.We also probably have differing needs. There are many Americans who feelthat 30 years or more after the end of World War II, we are still spending$30 billion a year at least in Europe. The point is, should we not considerfor efficiency closing some of these bases? I am not in any way advocating th<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ey<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> be closed. I am merely saying that it seems verystrange to me that this commission is limited to inside the United States.It would seem an efficient way would be to look at the worldwide militarysituation.Madam President, a number of years ago I served overseas in our Army asa sec<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>o<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>nd lieutenant. I must admit that being a second lieutenantdoes not give one the type of vision as serving as a general officer, butit has been my observation that we need to closely relate what we do overseasand what we do at h<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>o<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>me. I think part of the reason my amendment is objected to is there is anotheramendment being prepared which will say that we are going to do a parallelstudy. This is merely another study. This commission, as I understand it,has the force of law. It r<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ally digs into the real issue. What this commissionrecommends counts. I do not think we should settle for a parallel study. The bill, as I readit, now calls for a study of the actions planned with respect to militaryinstallations of the United States outside the United States. That willmerely be a study, and it will be by different people. So I feel strongly that the Senate should have an opportunity to vote upor down on this amendment. May I say from a personal point of view thatI ha<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>d<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> hoped to offer this amendment and get a vote onit. I think it deserves a vote. I hope a vote is delayed on this or ruledout by virtue of a procedural move because I am offering this in a verysincere fashion. I have been urged to come to the floor to offer amendments. My amendmentis ready for a vote, and I would like to see it brought up in a positionthat could be voted upon.  [S10MY8-244]{S5355}WARNERMr. WARNER addressed the Chair.  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.  [S10MY8-245]{S5355}WARNERMr. WARNER. I hope that this matter can be addressed, and I know it willbe addressed by the Senate in due course, For the benefit of the Senatorfrom South Dakota and others who may be listening, the distinguished Senatorfrom Illinois, the chariman, myself, and severa<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>l<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> others have been working diligently on a proposedmodification to the Dixon amendment, perhaps in the nature of a substituteamendment.  That substitute plans to deal with certain elements of the amendment beingoffered by the distinguished Senator from So<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>u<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>th Dakota. It is my belief that until such time as_wewill refer to it as the package_the compromise package is properly fashionedand crafted, neither my good friend from Illinois nor anyone e<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>l<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>se can agree to it, and that is understandable. Therefore, I am in a respectful way objecting to the Senator's amendmentbein<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>g<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> brought up as business of the Senate until suchtime as the package is perfected and the Senator from Illinois can addressthat package, toge<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>her with the chairman, myself, and others, so thatthe Senate, as a whole, has an understanding or an alternative that webelieve is a better alte<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>r<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>native than that contained in the proposed amendmentof the Senator from South Dakota.  I have further comments, but I see my friend form Illinois wants to saya few words. If not, I would like to continue.  [S10MY8-246]{S5355}DIXONMr. DIXON. I do not mean to interrupt my friend from Virginia.  [S10MY8-247]{S5355}WARNERMr. WARNER. Go ahead.  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illionis.  [S10MY8-248]{S5355}DIXONMr. DIXON. Madam President, I think what the Senator from Virginia is say<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ing<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> is qui<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>e relevant to the whole question of how we proceedin this matter. As all of my colleagues know, I have been objecting forthe last couple of days to the provisions of this bill on pages 161 through171 on a variety of provisions in the base closing section of the Departmentof Defense authorization bill.  One of the things I have been stressing is the fact we are only talki<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>n<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>g here about bases in the United States and not aboutforeign bases. But as my friend from Virginia has pointed out since earlyyesterday afternoon the chairman of the committee and the ranking memberof the committee, the distingui<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>hed Senator from Georgia and the distinguished Senatorfrom Virginia, have been accommodating this Senator and the Senator fromMichigan, the Senator from Alaska, the Senator from Maine, the Senatorfrom Pennsylvania, and others who differed with them, in trying to reacha compromise.  We have, in fact, achieved, may I say to my good friend, the distinguishedSenator from South Dakota who is discussing an amendment, a compromisethat we think it at least a reasonable accommodation of the different pointsof view.This first effort is not complete as written now, but we are presentlyin the process of rewriting that agreement in a form that can be offeredto this Senator's pending amendment that would reflect an accommodationof the different points of view.I am going to be very honest with you. I agree with the Senator from SouthDakota. If it was up to me, I would treat fo<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>r<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>eign bases exactly like domestic base<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> in this particular bill. But the other side hassome points as well.My distinguished friend from Virginia has suggested the truth of the matteris the Secretary of Defense really has the authority now to close any foreignbase. He does not have the problems with the Environmental Protection Actand other things that we have in connection with closing domestic bases,and so there are some arguments on both sides.Madam President, my experience in the legislative arena over a period ofyears has been that accommodations are something less than the whole. Itis not the whole loaf; it is a part of a loaf. I have here an accommodationthat is part of a loaf. It is not everything I want, but it is at leasta very substantial improvement over pages 161 through 171 of the bill asthey now<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>tand.So my difficulty with my dear friend, with whom I fully agree on the issue,is that if I go that nice long step with my friend from South Dakota, andwhether we win or lose, we then are on a course where I have a lot moreamendments, my friend from Pennsylvania has some amendments in mind, myfriend from Michigan has amendments in mind. I have an idea we are goingto be on amendments for a long time, and nobody knows what the end resultwill be.But we know for sure what the result is now with this accommodation. Thatis why I say to my friend from South Dak<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>o<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ta, whose position in this matter I fully agree with,that I would l like to have us consider the amendment that will shor<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ly be completed and will be brought to the floorand offered as an amendment to the bill. Once it is adopted, the Senatorstill has a right to try to further refine that with his own amendmenton the question of foreign bases.<CODE-213>5</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Frankly, I have said publicly during our discussions in the cloakroom,I will vote with him although I am candid to say I will not be an activeparticipant in the debate.But I do not think this: I think you can go right down the line with themembers who are composing the commission. I have problems with that. Butwe have an accommodation. The question of the foreign bases: problems butan accommodation. The question of geographical representation: problemsbut accommodation.All through this section of the bil<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>l,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> we have made some agreements that are at least acompromise of the disparative views of various members who were in thecommittee and fought this from the beginning and here on the floor.That is the dichotomy I face. On the one hand, I support what the Senatoris saying, and I think the Senator is right. On the other hand, I wantto get a bill some day, I want to get something here.[S10MY8-249]{S5355}PRESSLERMr. PRESSLER. Will my colleague yield? I very much appreciate the remarksof my colleague. I frequently find myself voting for his amendments. Iexpressed earlier today support for one of his amendments.Let me ask my good friend this. He speaks so eloquently, and others inthe group who are reaching this compromise are the leaders in this Senate.All I am asking for is perhaps an agreement to debate my amendment for10 minutes and get a rollcall vote on it. No doubt, from the eloquencethat the Senator has shown in arguing against my amendment, it will bedefeated. But I would like to offer it and get a vote on it. I was urgedto bring my amendment to the floor this afternoon because we had a window.I spoke to the ranking member. He said now is the time to go. I am readyto go. I am ready to vote right now. I am sure, because of the eloquentargument the Senator has just made, it will be defeated, but I would likea vote on it. Could I get that?[S10MY8-250]{S5355}DIXONMr. DIXON. May I say to my dear friend, first he is kind to suggest thatfrom time to time this Member is eloquent, but beyond that I would notbe inclined to oppose his amendment because I agree with it.But the point I make to my friend is the Senator's point of view was eloquentlyI think expressed by others in the conference discussions where we foughtthis through and got this compromise. This bill is far better now for thosediscussions with respect to foreign bases than it would have been priorto the discussion that took place. We are saying in here that the commissioncan deal with foreign bases. I would argue, as a man who has concerns here,that if they come back with a list of 12 domestic bases to be closed andthis commission has not put one foreign base on it or made any recommendationsabout any foreign base, there will be a tremendous hue and cry on thisfloor to not close 14 or 12, whatever it is, domestic bases with no attentionto foreign bases.So I think some points have been made. Our problem now is if we turn tothe Senator's amendment first, we have the difficulty that if it is adopted,the whole accommodation is going to go down the chute. On the other hand,if it is not adopted and is overwhelmingly defeated, it puts those of uswho advocate the same point of view as the distinguished Senator from SouthDakota in a very difficult position when we go to conference.[S10MY8-251]{S5356}PRESSLERMr. PRESSLER. My friend makes strong arguments for the Senate not votingon very many issues. There are many different sides to this. But my amendmentis fairly straightforward. I think a lot of Senators would like a chanceto vote on it. Now, it is true that there are many members of the ArmedServices Committee and others who have been discussing it, and I have beendiscussing it with others. Some of us who are not on the committee arevery interested in this bill also and want to be supportive and have beensupportive of my friend from Illinois and others.I would like to see a vote on this. If we do not vote, we will go intoa quorum call and there will be calls for Senators to bring their amendmentsto the floor. I am ready to vote. I would ask my friends to remove theirprocedural objections and let us go to a vote.[S10MY8-252]{S5356}DIXONMr. DIXON. May I say to my friend that I am presently looking at the amendmentthat may represent the amendment that we are able to agree upon. It willtake me a moment to look at it. If the distinguised Senator from SouthDakota would accommodate me and permit me to look at this amendment forthe time being, we will get back to this issue.[S10MY8-253]{S5356}PRESSLERMr. PRESSLER. If my friend will yield, I say to<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> the<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> ranking member, I would even be willing to havethe amendment laid down now, have the amendment offered as a second-degreeamendment, vote on this one first and the first one next.[S10MY8-254]{S5356}WARNERMr. WARNER. Madam President, this is a proposition which I am now goingto convey to the chairman of the committee, ou<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> of respect, of course, to him. I would have to sayat this time I do not have the flexibility to offer that, and even if Iwere to withdraw my objection to the Senator's laying aside the pendingamendment, I know in the Chamber there are others who would interpose anobjection, so do not, please, view this Senator as being the sole obstruction.[S10MY8-255]{S5356}PRESSLERMr. PRESSLER. My good friend from Virginia said if you have amendments,bring them to <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>he floor and offer them.[S10MY8-256]{S5356}WARNERMr. WARNER. There is no question about that. The leadership of the Senate,together with the managers of the bill, asked our Members to come over,but I wonder if I may speak for a few minutes to the proposed amendment.As my colleague and friend from Illinois stated in our conference overhere, I acquainted the Members of the Senate with the existing situationwith respect to overseas bases. There is a very sharp contrast betweenthe authority of the Secretary of Defense with respect to an overseas baseand a domestic base. An overseas base can be closed by the President, theSecretary of Defense acting on behalf of the President, subject to anytreaty obligations, subject to a memorandum of understanding with anothercountry, or subject to what we call <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>o<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>perating force agreement<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> which we have. They are basically the three thingsthat control overseas installations.    Now, you have to assume that we have had a succession of Secretaries ofDefense. I have been privileged to serve under three and worked with anotherthree since I have been privileged to be in the Senate, men of both parties,men of good intentions, that they would be closing overseas facilitiesif those facilities were not in the interest of our national defense andoperating in a cost-effective and militarily effective way. So I do notwant Members of the Senate to believe that all of a sudden if we throwinto consideration on a_I continue to use the term parallel basis_overseasbases with domestic bases, suddenly there is a big grab bag of things overseasfrom which to make choices for closing. They simply do n<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ot<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> exist, but the authority is in the <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>S<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ecretary of Defense right now to close those installations.The problem is domestic. A closure in the United States under the currentlaw is surrounded by a number of obstacles and Members of the Congr<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ss can use those obstacles quite effectively to deterand literally block the Secretary of Defense from closing domestic installations.That is the reason for this bill. It is to give a one-time shot to a future<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>S<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ecretary of Defense to close a lot of bases and installationsin the United States which are acknowledged not to be in the military interestsof this country, either cost-effective or otherwise. So there is a sharpcontrast between overseas and domestic.  You are not going to fund a grab bag of things overseas, but as we wroteinto the bill and we now have in the compromise we are going to put someresponsibility on the Secretary to make certain that the <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>C<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ommission has full knowledge of all the overseasinstallations such as they consider the closures domestically th<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ey<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> can have in mind what is overseas and how the overseasinstallat<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>io<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ns do or do not impact on a domestic base.  [S10MY8-257]{S5356}PRESSLERMr. PRESSLER. My friend argues very eloquently and is very knowledgeablein this area, and I would agree with everything he has said. Why wouldhe fear letting a <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>C<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ommission make the same decisions regarding overseasbases? Surely they could consider the same things the Senator has outlined.They could consider the value of a base in Washington State as comparedto a base<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>in Germany or Portugal. They could consider the wholebase situation worldwide. Why is my friend hesitant to have the <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>C<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ommission have the same authority? He merely wantsto study the ones overseas. Everything he said is true. The <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>C<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ommission could consider everything he said. The<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>C<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ommission could do everything he said. I think thisamendment would pass the Senate overwhelmingly if we could get it up toa vote, and I think it is only fair that we bring it up to a vote becauseI have not heard an argument against it. I agree with everything the <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>S<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>enator has said. The <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>C<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ommission should consider whether closing overseasbases is mo<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>r<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>e complicated or less complicated. The <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>C<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ommission should consider all of the bases. <CODE-213>5</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>[S10MY8-258]{S5356}WARNERMr. WARNER. Let me respond to my distinguished friend and colleague. Theproposed amendment which we are soon to bring forth to the Senate wouldgive the Commission, first, an affirmative duty to examine the recommendationsof the Secretary of Defense with respect to the overseas structure.They would have to look at it in the context of their work on the domesticbases. Then they have to option of recommending to the Secretary such closuresor changes in the overseas installations as they deem appropriate. So itcomes back, they are charged with the domestic scene and believe me, thequantum of work involved in analyzing the domestic scene is so large thatwe cannot put on them, as the Senator's amendment would, the affirmativeduty to give an equal amount of time to the overseas situation. They simplycould not get it done in the <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>pe<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>riod.[S10MY8-259]{S5356}PRESSLERMr. PRESSLER. Why does not my friend make that argument against my amendmentand let me have a vote on it? We have the time to make the argument againstit. Give me a vote on my amendment.[S10MY8-260]{S5356}WARNERMr. WARNER. I want the opportunity for the Senate as a whole, before addressingthe Senator's amendment, to have the chance to study the substitute, andstudy the substitute in the context of other aspects of this base closingpackage.The Senator<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>'s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> amendment, quite frankly, has a lot of appeal. Itwill sell very well back home because our constituents have difficultyin understanding it. I do not say this in any pejoratic sense, but theyhave difficulty in understanding why we should close a base in, say, Crossroads,USA, and leave open the base in Germany, the Philippines, or Japan, becausethe base in Crossroads, USA is an integral part of the local economy, butnot the base in Japan or the Philippines.[S10MY8-261]{S5356}PRESSLERMr. PRESSLER. But my amendment would not require it. It merely says theCommission would consider equally all bases worldwide <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>at<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> the same time.[S10MY8-262]{S5356}WARNERMr. WARNER. I understand the Senator's amendment quite clearly, and whatit does. But my point is that we have to focus on the necessity to concentratethis Commission's efforts on the domestic scene. They will not have theadequate staff to do all the overseas survey. It would require practicallya doubling of the staff.I am not so <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>su<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>re that the Members who have thus far indicated awillingness to serve on this Commission and, as a matter of fact, I havereason to believe they would not want the added responsibility to takethe extensive travel as would be required to do a proper evaluation ofthe overseas structure. Therefore, it the Senator's amendment were to pass,it may well bring down the whole base closure package.That is why I want the Se<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>na<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>te to have the opportunity to study this compromisein the context of all the provisions of this package of compromises, andhopefully their judgment will be that it is reasonable to have this Commissionfocus on the domestic scene.[S10MY8-263]{S5357}PRESSLERMr. PRESSLER. I understand my colleagues to say that the<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>y<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> will object procedurally to a vote on my amendment.[S10MY8-264]{S5357}WARNERMr. WARNER. I am not objecting, but I understand there are persons in theChamber who will object. As a courtesy to my classmate and friend in theSe<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>na<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>te, I will not personally object because there areothers who are prepared to do so.[S10MY8-265]{S5357}PRESSLERMr. PRESSLER. But the Senator has objected?[S10MY8-266]{S5357}WARNERMr. WARNER. I am perfectly willing to withdraw that objection momentarily,if that will help. But I assure the Senator objections will come from otherquarters of this Chamber.[S10MY8-267]{S5357}PRESSLER<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Mr. <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>PRESSLER. Madam President, I guess there is not muchpoint in taking up the time of the Senate, although I understand the Senatewanted amendments this afternoon. I have other amendments, but I will notoffer them because they will probably be objected to.But I do feel strongly that we should proceed. I feel strongly we shouldhave a vote on this amendment. I found in talking to certain other Senatorsthat they are very interested in a clean vote on this. I think what isbeing attempted here is to have a study, another study instead of lettingthe Commission really consider things worldwide.If this Commission is going to close bases in the United States, we aregoing to be hard pressed to explain to our constituents why some overseasbases were not considered for closing because there was a study of that.Why can we not put them on the same basi<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s?<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> That is what my amendment would do.I am not saying we should close the ones overseas; I am not saying we shouldclose any domestically. I am merely saying if we are going to empower theCo<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>mm<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ission to have the authority to close a base in Virginiaor Georgia or Washington we should empower that same Commission to closeone in Germany or the Philippines or Portugal or Greece or Turkey. Andwithout advocating that they be closed, I think there are inefficienciesin some of those bases. I think there are Americans who believe the timehas come for us to consider our worldwide commitment and to consider makingchanges in it.I also feel strongly that this Senate needs to take a clean vote on this,and it should not be objected to procedurally. We are told there is a compromise.Indeed, it is a good-sounding compromise, but the Commission still hasthe same powers. It can merely do a study. It does not get any power.What I am talking about is giving it some power. I am very saddened thatwhen this amendment comes up it is objected to procedurally and we cannot get a vote on it. If it is a bad amendment, it would be defeated.Here we have a group on the Armed Services Committee not allowing the restof the Members of the Senate to have a vote on this issue. And I thinkmany of us want such a vote.I do not serve on the Armed Services Committee. I do not have a chanceto offer amendments in committee. This is an amendment I am offering onthe floor.Indeed, I have not even a single cosponsor for this amendment. How canmy distinguished colleagues, some of the most distinguished Members ofthe Senate, object to having a vote on this three-word, four-word amendment?So I am p<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>er<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>plexed at this. But it appears there is very littleI can do about it.[S10MY8-268]{S5357}DIXONMr. DIXON addressed the Chair.The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. <T4>Shelby</T4>). The Senator from Illinois.[S10MY8-269]{S5357}DIXONMr. DIXON. Mr. President, I want to discuss the compromise that we havebeen referring to in the course of this debate so that the Senators willknow what has been accomplished. The original bill in pages 161 through171 simply provided that the Secretary of Defense could appoint a Commissionto be picked by the Secretary of Defense to study this whole question ofbase closing.In the course of the compromi<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>se <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>agreement, the advocates of this position have agreedto add additional language that says that there will be six additionalmembers of the Commission who will be appointed after consultation withthe chairman and ranking minority members of the appropriate committeesof Congress, and the Military Construction Subcommittees thereof, and (B)national associations of State and local officials since obviously baseclosings affect State and local officials.<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>It <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>further provides that members shall be chosen onthe basis of knowledge and experience in matters relating to Federal property,national security affairs, or economic planning, and that they shall reflecta reasonable geographical balance.Senators will remember that I complained about the fact that basicallythe nine members of the Commission, the names before us, were folks mostlyfrom the Washington, DC area or here on the east coast.Another important aspect of the compromise is that instead of using theSecretary of Defense staff and folks who are part of that system for thisstudy, this compromise provides that the Secretary of Defense shall providethe Commission with a nonpartisan, independent staff, and the staff shallconsist of Governme<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>nt<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> employees and consultants who have not been employedby the Department of Defense during the calendar year 1988.Further, we provide in respect to the question of base closings and thequestion of domestic and foreign bases, we add on page 162 of the billat line 20 this language:[S10MY8-270]{S5357}<ITAG tagnum="21">And that no installation identified to be closed or realigned is ofa higher priority to the

and very important, we add an entire sectionto the bill, consisting of five pages, entitled ``Congressional DisapprovalProcedures,'' which

Mr. President, I would like to add my stamp of approval to thisproposed compromise, one that has been worked out in a bipartisan spiritof attempting to move ahead with the legislation.As I said earlier, the amendment of my distinguished friend and colleaguefrom Illinois was unconstitutional, in my judgment, in the sense that itdid mix up the executive and legislative functions in such a way that Idoubt that the courts would uphold it. I do think that the proposed revisionis a major step forward.I ask the distinguished Senator from Illinois if he would agree with methat an additional six members would be appointed to the Commission bythe Pre<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ident, after consulting with the chairman and theranking member of the Armed Services Committee and, I believe, the Subcommitteeon Construction. Is that correct?[S10MY8-274]{S5358}DIXONMr. DIXON. That is substantially correct. The additional members wouldbe added by the Secretary of Defense, who, I presume, would file anotheramended charter in the Federal Register. I think that is the way it wouldbe done from a practical standpoint.[S10MY8-275]{S5358}ROTHMr. ROTH. Second, there would be the opportunity for Congress to vote aresolution of disapproval on an expedited basis.[S10MY8-276]{S5358}DIXONMr. DIXON. The Senator is correct.May I say that this Senator wanted to do it on the basis of approval byCongress, but I was not able to exact that kind of exception, but I amaccepting this as the best compromise I could get.The Senator is correct: It would be a vote of disapproval in both Houses.[S10MY8-277]{S5358}ROTHMr. ROTH. Will the distinguished Senator from Illinois advise me what theexpedited period of time would be?[S10MY8-278]{S5358}DIXONMr. DIXON. I will be delighted to do that. The expedited period of timeis set forth in the agreement. Within 45 session days, that would takeplace.[S10MY8-279]{S5358}ROTHMr. ROTH. Within 45 days?[S10MY8-280]{S5358}DIXONMr. DIXON. Within 45 session days of the receipt of the report by the Secretary,and the Secretary is to receive the report by December 31. So, presumably,by the middle of February, approximately, of next year, the expedited procedurewould take place.[S10MY8-281]{S5358}ROTHMr. ROTH. So, in effect, it assures prompt action and does not unnecessarilydelay the entire proceedings.Finally, will the distinguished Senator from Illinois clarify what wouldbe done with respect to foreign bases? As I understand it, a study wouldbe made.[S10MY8-282]{S5358}DIXONMr. DIXON. Yes. What would be done is this: By September 15, 1988, theSecretary of Defense would provide to that Commission, which would be inexistence immediately upon the enactment of the Defense Department authorizationbill, all information pertaining to base closures or other considerations,base realignments, in any foreign countries which would be considered bythe Commission. The accommodation that we have arri<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ve<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>d at in this amendment also says that the Commission,itself, voluntarily, on its own initiative, may look into these questionsand may require more information from the Secretary of Defense. So thatthis Commission, of course, may act on its own initiative with respectto recommendations it might make.The distinction is that this Commission cannot include a foreign base inthe list it has the authority to file by December 31 that would mandatea closing unless disapproved by Congress. It would be a s<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ep<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>arate act of the Commission. But I would argue_andwe discussed this in the Cloakroom_that at least if you had that information,one who took exception to a domestic base closing could say, ``Why didn'tthey do it with respect to the foreign base that the Commission did mentionin its report?''[S10MY8-283]{S5358}ROTHMr. ROTH. Is it not also true that there are not the same political problems?[S10MY8-284]{S5358}DIXONMr. DIXON. It is probably true that there are not the same political problems.I basically agree with the Senator from South Dakota. I would like to havethe foreign bases in the Commis<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>si<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>on report just like domestic bases. But I say tothe Senator from Delaware that I have been in the legislative process alittle while, and an accommodation of honor is one in which each side givesa little.[S10MY8-285]{S5358}ROTHMr. ROTH. I say to the distinguished Senator, as one of the original cosponsorsof the proposed Commission, that <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>I f<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ind that I could support the proposed resolutionof the Dixon amendment. I think it moves us along the legislative roadand would provide a means of resolving the dispute. I congratulate himfor his willingness to make a compromise in this area. I will be happyto support the proposal.[S10MY8-286]{S5358}DIXONMr. DIXON. It would be a great honor to have the Senator from Delawareas a cosponsor.The distinguished Senator from Alaska [Mr. <T4>Stevens</T4>], who feels strongly about foreign base closings, hasjust sent word to me that he also wants to be a cosponsor, which I thinkis indicative of the fact that there are a lot of people with strong viewshere who are willing to accept this accommodation as the best we can do.I want to be careful to mention the name of my distinguished friend fromMichigan, Mr. <T4>Levin, </T4>who played a part in this yesterday and today.If you get an agreement and an accommodation between people of honor withdifferent points of view, everybody gives a little.This is not all I want, but it is a good deal less than my friends fromGeorgia and Virginia_who are the chairman and ranking member_wanted togive.(At this point Mr. <T4>Bingaman </T4>assumed the chair.)[S10MY8-287]{S5358}ROTHMr. ROTH. I want to make the record very clear that I agree with the distinguishedchairman and ranking member of the committee. It goes much further thanI would have preferred, but I do think it is a reasonable compromise.I would be happy to have my name added as a cosponsor.Mr. President, earlier in this debate I recounted why the pending amendmentis unconstitutional under the Buckley versus Valeo decision of the SupremeCourt. I noted the Buckley case because I find a close analogy betweenthe pending amendment and the unconstitutional provision in that case.But Buckley is not the only example that could be called to the attentionof my colleagues.Under the separation of powers doctrine, the Congress writes the laws andthe President carries them out. While Congress may, by law, direct theexecutive branch how to carry out a law, it may not carry out the law itself.In Buckley, Congress tried to carry out a law by appointing the peoplewho carried it out. When that was ruled unconstitutional, Congress triedanother approach. It statutorily assigned duties to executive officersappointed in conformity with the appointments clause, thereby complyingwith Buckley, but tried to keep its arm on the arm of the executive officialthrough the legislative veto. In INS versus Chadha the Supreme Court struckthat down.Undaunted in our efforts to influence the execution of laws, Congress nextsought to influence the action of an officer appointed by the Presidentin conformity with the appointments clause over whom Congress would exerciseno veto authority in this way: while complying with Buckley and Chadha,Congress would retain the power to remove such officer by joint resolution.Now this influence was far more tenuous than the use of legislative appointeescondemned in Buckley or the veto condemned in Chadha. Nevertheless, inBowsher versus Synar, the Supreme Court struck down that effort as well.The lesson is clear. Under the separation of powers doctrine Congress cannottake part in the execution of our laws. The pending amendment violatesthat doctrine. It would place eight Members of Congress on the Commissionto determine which bases should be closed. The Commission's action is notadvisory but has legal consequences. Therefore, under Buckley, Chadha,and Bowsher, congressional appointees cannot serve on the Commission.The amendment must be rejected as unconstitutional.<CODE-213>5</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213>[S10MY8-288]<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>{S5359}<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>DIXON<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Mr. DIXON.

I believe the suggestions made by the Senatorfrom Illinois and things we have been working on for several hours noware reasonable. I think they probably improve the overall approach. I havesome reluctance on a few of them, but I think overall we are striking aproper balance here. So I do plan to support this compromise that we haveworked out. <CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>I would like to ask, and I do not have the finaldraft, but this is a preliminary draft, it is my understanding that thewords have not been changed. If this is the final draft I will direct thesame questions to that draft. But the preliminary draft says the Secretaryof Defense shall provide the Commission with a nonpartisan independentstaff. The staff shall consist of Government employees and consultantswho have not been employed by the Department of Defense during calendaryear 1988. <CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>I do not believe it is our intent to limit the staffto Government employees and consultants. <CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Could I pose that question to the Senator? <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>[S10MY8-292]<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>{S5359}<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>DIXON<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Mr. DIXON. It was not our intention to limit it inthat way, no, I think not.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>[S10MY8-293]<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>{S5359}<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>NUNN<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Mr. NUNN. I believe that the intent really was thatonce the staff was employed, they would indeed become either Governmentemployees or consultants for the duration of this. But I am not sure thatwe intended to have that limit. If there was a staff person that they wantedto hire that was independent and nonpartisan, that was not a Governmentemployee and would not be a consultant, I would want that person to beable to be hired.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>[S10MY8-294]<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>{S5359}<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>DIXON<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Mr. DIXON. Yes, I agree with that and I think perhapsthat correction should be made and can be made as the amendment is broughtin momentarily.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>[S10MY8-295]<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>{S5359}<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>NUNN<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Mr. NUNN. Is it the intent of the Senator from Illinoisthat there would be no one that is now employed by the Department of Defenseon that staff? Is that the intent?<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>[S10MY8-296]<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>{S5359}<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>DIXON<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Mr. DIXON. That is the intent. This language actuallywas the language suggested by the distinguished Senator from Michigan,who felt that it would be important to have staff members doing this jobwho were not agen<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>s of the Secretary of Defense and had no obligationto the Secretary of Defense in connection with their work. That languageresults from his initiative and perhaps it would be valuable, though Ido not see him here.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>[S10MY8-297]<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>{S5359}<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>NUNN<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Mr. NUNN. I think these words need massaging a littlebit. We use the word ``nonpartisan'' all the time. I am not sure what nonpartisanmeans in the sense of hiring somebody. Does that mean they never have beena Republican or Democrat? I do not know what it means. I think we needto massage these words a little bit.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>[S10MY8-298]<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>{S5359}<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>DIXON<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Mr. DIXON. I would agree with the Senator.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>[S10MY8-299]<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>{S5359}<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>NUNN<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Mr. NUNN. We certainly want an objective and independentstaff and the intent is not to have employees of the Department of Defense,although I would not have suggested that. I think we have people in theDepartment of Defense who could perform this task. If that is part of thecompromise, then I think we ought to find <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> way of describing those without describing themas Government employees and consultants.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>[S10MY8-300]<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>{S5359}<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>McCAIN<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Mr. <T4>McCAIN. </T4>Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question alongthose lines?<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>[S10MY8-301]<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>{S5359}<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>DIXON<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Mr. DIXON.

No, I do not think that is the intentat all, just that nobody who has been employed by the Department of Defenseduring the calendar year 1988 would be a member. And I agree wholeheartedlywith the Senator from Georgia. I do not know what nonpartisan means. Theyhave nonpartisan elections in some cities in Illinois that are more bitterthan the Republican and Democratic confrontations I have observed. I donot know what nonpartisan means. We probably do need a better word there,may I say quite candidly, but I was not involved in that initiative andI think perhaps we could suggest that that be improved.[S10MY8-304]{S5359}NUNNMr. NUNN. Frankly, if the Secretary of Defense wants to get a package through,he would indeed be rather foolish to put someone on the Commission whohad been, for instance, the chairman of the Demo<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>c<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ratic Party in the State of Illinois or chairmanof the Republican Party in the State of Arizona, or something of that nature.I am not sure we need to spell it out. I think we get down to common senseon that. I do not think we want to disqualify someone who had a party affiliationof some sort. [S10MY8-305]{S5359}DIXONMr. DIXON. I fully agree with that, may I say to the distinguished chairman.Perhaps we can clean that up a little bit. [S10MY8-306]{S5359}NUNNMr. NUNN. I thank the Senator. [S10MY8-307]{S5359}DIXONMr. DIXON. I agree entirely with what the distinguished manager is saying.May I respond to the concerns of the Senator from Arizona? [S10MY8-308]{S5359}McCAINMr. McCAIN. I also would like to follow up on what our distinguished chairmansaid. There are people who have served in previous administrations, bothRepublican and Democratic, that I think would be eminently qualified toserve on this commission, and I would hesitate to support language whichwould basically rule out all of those individuals. [S10MY8-309]{S5359}DIXONMr. DIXON. May I respond quickly by interrupting the Senator? [S10MY8-310]{S5359}McCAINMr. McCAIN. Yes. [S10MY8-311]{S5359}DIXONMr. DIXON. What we are talking about here is staff. As to the Commissionitself, the language of the accommodation suggests the Commission willbe the nine-member <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>C<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ommission already represented in the charter. Isthe Senator familiar with the charter? [S10MY8-312]{S5359}McCAINMr. McCAIN. Yes, I am familiar with it. [S10MY8-313]{S5360}DIXONMr. DIXON. While we all have these names floating around<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> I do not guess that those nine names are exactlyofficial, but there are nine people on the <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>C<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ommission. We enlarged that for an additional sixpeople on the Commission, and then give to the chairman of the jurisdictionalcommittees, of course, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee hereand the chairman of the jurisdictional subcommittees and representativesof the State and local officials organizations an opportunity to be consultedwith respect to those additio<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>nal<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> six. They could presumably be partisans. For instance,on that list<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> the original commission list<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> I think you have Ribicoff and Edwards. They werecertainly in their time partisan, I would say good partisans. [S10MY8-314]{S5360}McCAINMr. McCAIN. If the Senator will yield, my point is that in regard to membersof the staff there are people who have served honorably in other administrations,whether they be Republican or Democrat, and I would not be supportive ofsuch a move that would exclude them if at some point in their career theyhad been somehow politically involved. [S10MY8-315]{S5360}DIXONMr. DIXON. I do not have any problem with that observation. [S10MY8-316]{S5360}McCAINMr. <T4>McCAIN. </T4>I would hope that that language would be changed in orderto reflect that. As the chairman pointed out, it would be foolishness toput a member on that staff who was somehow closely identified on a partisanbasis.[S10MY8-317]{S5360}DIXONMr. DIXON. Sure.[S10MY8-318]{S5360}McCAINMr. <T4>McCAIN. </T4>Such an appointment would dest<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>roy<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> a lot of the credibility of the <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>C<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ommission. At the same time, I would not want tosee excluded someone who has a reputation for having expertise. After all,the staff of this <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>C<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ommission needs to have to have an enormous amountof knowledge and expertise. That may require us to draw upon someone whohas served in previous administration in the Department of Defense.[S10MY8-319]{S5360}NUNNMr. NUNN. Will the Senator yield on that point, because that is anotherpoint I wanted to make?[S10MY8-320]{S5360}McCAINMr. <T4>McCAIN. </T4>I yield.[S10MY8-321]{S5360}NUNNMr. NUNN. I agree that the top staff people_I do not know whether therebe two or three staff people here or five or six or whatever_I would agreethere is a case to be made for them to be independent to the e<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>xt<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ent of not being under the Secretary of Defense.Also knowing the bases as we all do, and the Senator from Illinois knowsthem very well, and the Senator from Arizona does_we deal<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> with them_there has to be a tremendous amount ofinformation given to whatever staff is hired. Independent and objectiveas they may be, they have to have information flow. There is really onlyone place the information flow can come from, and that is the Departmentof Defense.I would hope that we could identify the top staff people as not being partof the Department of Defense, but not preclude them assigning some otherpeople who are not part of the Department of Defense, either staff or consultation,because that is where the information has to come from.What I thought we were basically tentatively agreeing to is that the topstaff people would be outside the Department, but there would be able tobe some staffing. If they had to develop all this information independently,we would be talking about a 15- or 20-year project. I know nobody intendsthat. So we have to have the information flow come from the Departmentof Defense.[S10MY8-322]{S5360}McCAINMr. <T4>McCAIN. </T4>If the Senator will further yield, I understand we areto receive information in the Congress by December 31. That is a very shortperiod of time. To ask people who have no knowledge or expertise on thisissue to make those kinds of recommendations would be not only unlikelybut impossible.We need to work on that.[S10MY8-323]{S5360}NUNNMr. NUNN. I would suggest perhaps we can converse with the Senator fromMichigan on that. But I think it is going to be necessary to go over thatlanguage rather carefully.I do not believe it is his intent to prevent the flow of information comingfrom the Department of Defense to this <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>C<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ommission. I would hope they would be objective enoughand independent enough to question it, to go back and demand additionalinformation or clarifications or to challenge it where they feel it wasin question<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>.<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> But nevertheless, tha<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> information flow has to come from the Department.[S10MY8-324]{S5360}McCAINMr. <T4>McCAIN<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>.<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> </T4>If the Senator from Illinois would yield, Irequest a moment to make two more comments <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>to <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>him on this compromise, which I did not help formulate.I have no hard feelings about that lack of participation. I understandthat time constraints and the issues at hand lend themselves to requiringa compromise which has been agreed to by the majority on both sides ofthe aisle. I would not stand in its way.I would like to point out two concerns. One, regards the compromise's wor<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>d<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ing concerning a vote of disapproval. I understandthat given a 51-Member vote of disapproval, if the President vetoed thatdisa<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>p<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>proval, it would come back and require 67 votes,at least of this body. [S10MY8-325]{S5360}DIXONMr. DIXON. May I say candidly I did not want this. This is part of an agreementI yielded on and I am not happy with it. But I would rather have congressionalinput of some kind than no congressional input at all, so I have acceptedwhat I consider to be a compromise. It is not a very good one in that area,may I say. [S10MY8-326]{S5360}McCAINMr. M<T4>cCAIN. </T4>I understand. My concern is I can envision, as I thinkthe Senator from Illinois can, enormous pressures being generated on thoseSenators from States that are experiencing a base closing. We work in thisbody on the basis of friendship and close relationships and I think itcould place others in a very difficult position. I see some dangers in the road ahead by doing this. But I am not standingto oppose it. I am voicing my deep concern about it. The second issue I would like to mention to my distinguished friend fromIllinois, is this whole issue of overseas bases. To some degree, I viewit as a straw man in that the problems that lie ahead, as far as I viewthe situation throughout the world, if the loss of overseas bases for foreignpolitical reasons rather than close them for domestic political reasons.We see what is happening in the negotiations over the bases in Greece.We see the forced removal of an F-16 wing from Spain. In the opinion ofmost experts, if there was a referendum in the Philippines today, of thekind presently being planned by the Philippine Government, that would callfor a removal of our bases in the Philippines.  I think we are mixing apples and oranges here because the reasons we havenot been able to close domestic bases in the United States are largelydomestic, political reasons. In contrast, our problems overseas are thelack of, or in<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ufficiency of, bases. This shortfall is generatedby an entirely different set of factors. I think that including the overseasbase issue in this compromise will confuse the issue and divert the commissionto some extent from its basic purpose which is to examine bases withinthe United States.     I think the issue of overseas bases needs to be addressed. But I wouldsuggest it should be best addressed in a separate context.  I again would like to congratulate my friend form Illinois on shaping whatI would accept as a reasonable compromise. I know he has worked long andhard on this issue.  [S10MY8-327]{S5360}DIXONMr. DIXON. May I first say to the Senator from Arizona, who I hold in thehighest personal regard, from whom I have a very true, warm affection,that I would have been delighted to have had him as one of the participantsin these discussions that took place.  Nobody w<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>s excluded, may I observe. Anybody that came alongwas welcome to join. I made a particular effort to call__  [S10MY8-328]{S5360}McCAINMr. <T4>McCAIN.</T4> I say to my friend I did not mean to intimate that thatwas in any way the case.  [S10MY8-329]{S5360}DIXONMr. DIXON. I received it in that fashion and I thank the Senator.  You just demonstrate once again what generated my response to my dear friendfrom South Dakota who very strongly feels we ought to address <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>overseas<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> bases here. I agree with him. You disagree withme.  Your position was expressed very strongly by the ranking member, the distinguishedSenator from Virginia and the chairman, the distinguished Senator fromGeorgia.  Everybody was in the mix; everybody was presenting their point of viewin the cloakroom. We achieved an accommodation of honor that I feel compelledto stand by, now, because I participated in the whole game. But that isnot to say that others would not disagree with this and I guess, you know,we could be here a pretty long time.  That is already pretty clear, talking about base closure, because we arestill on my first amendment, a<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>n<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>d I have got about 10 or 12 of them here, all ofwhich I think have some value. <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>B<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ut we probably will lay this to rest shortly whenthis compromise amendment is adopted. But the Senator from <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>S<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>outh Dakota has a right to offer his amendment. There are some of us who will vote for it. I will not say anything, butI have an idea th<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>t this agreement will probably prevail. And thenwe will go to the conference and see what the White House thinks and therewill be more refinements and modifications and ultimately I think we willget a result that most people will think is a result that has been honedby the legislative process.  What more could you ask for than that. We live in a great system whereeverything is discussed publicly, nothing behind closed doors, and everybodyknows that is happening. I have the amendment here. There is one part ofit, due to what you have said and the distinguished chairman of the committeehas said, that may need refinement. I would be inclined then, Mr. President,at this time, to send an amendment to the desk which says ``Strike allafter paragraph 2 on line 3 and add the following.''  I offer that as an amendment in the second degree, subject to my friendfrom Michigan having a look at it.

I yield the floor.[S10MY8-349]{S5363}COHENMr. COHEN addressed the Chair.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.[S10MY8-350]{S5363}COHENMr. COHEN. Mr. President, I regret I have not been able to be on the floorduring the day. Senator <T4>Boren, <CODE-213>5</CODE-213></T4><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>and I, and others have been tied up in the IntelligenceCommittee on matters pertaining to the INF Treaty.I did want to come to the floor to make a few comments, and to commendthe efforts of my colleague from Illinois. It seems that he has been wagingalmost a one-man battle on the floor to try and inject a congressionalrole into a process that I think is proceeding along in a very shortsightedfashion.I would like to take a few moments to discuss the history behind the adoptionof an amendment I helped pass when I was a Member of the House of Representativesback in 1976. It is no secret that I had a base, Loring Air Force Base,a SAC base in Maine. Senator Muskie was then a Member of this Chamber.We received a notice one day. The Air Force requested a meeting with us.We sat down with them. An Air Force official said:[S10MY8-351]{S5363}<ITAG tagnum="21">I am telling you in advance that Loring Air Force Base may be on apreliminary hit list, as such, for closure.</ITAG>We said:[S10MY8-352]{S5363}<ITAG tagnum="21">Thank you for the advance notice, but can you tell us what the criteriaare for the recommendations that this base be shut down?</ITAG>The answer was:[S10MY8-353]{S5363}<ITAG tagnum="21">We can't tell you what the criteria are at this point, we can onlyadvise you that your base may be subjected to closure.</ITAG>Loring Air Force Base happened to be a major base in my State. We neededmore information and were unable to get it until such time as the Air Forceactually decided to designate Loring for reduction, about <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>n 80 percent reduction_a significant reduction.We decided at that point that Congress had at least an obligation to findout what the Department of Defense rationale really was. When we finallydetermined what the criteria were, one, of course, was national securityinterest, and no one can question that. But we asked what the rationalewas: ``Well, this particular base was close enough to the coastline thata Soviet submarine with a flat trajectory on an SLBM could take out Loringin very short notice.''``That is a fair comment, a fair observation. We certainly don't want tojeopardize the national security interest, but where are you going to movethe bombers to?''Well, the Air Force was going to move them to a base, we found, out later,that was even closer to a potential Soviet submarine attack. That rationaledid not hold up.We asked them for an environmental statement of what the impact was uponthe community. The Air Force had the base located in the wrong part ofthe State. They had no idea where the base was.Each criteria that was listed was found, upon analysis, to be faulty. Wesaid: ``Something is wrong here.'' Our people in Maine were fully preparedto accept the closure of that base or a substantial reduction of that baseif they could satisfy us that a reason was offered that would hold up underanalysis. The people of Maine were prepared to accept that. We had alreadybegun to make alternative plans for the base.But we said: ``Wait, we are going to find out what the reason is.''It turned out the reason was more political than anything else. So we resistedthat particular recommendation.We did pass legislation, which I do not apologize for.[S10MY8-354]{S5364}DIXONMr. DIXON. May I say I do not apologize for it either. I think it is goodlegislation.[S10MY8-355]{S5364}COHENMr. COHEN. The Department of Defense comes to the Congress to request thefunds to open bases. Why do we not just create a commission? Why botherto come before the Congress to request the funds to open up a new base,to build the infrastructure, to make the substantial improvements thatare necessary in runways and base facilities and schools and everythingthat goes with it? You build up a small town into a major operation byvirtue of that base and then overnight you shut it down without any consultation,without really a justification that will withstand analysis, and say thatis just too bad, that is the military's decision.If that is the case, they do not need Congress to open the base. Yet theproposal in this bill takes us out of the process altogether, saying justgive it to a commission.Once again, when it comes to a tough decision, we abdicate our responsibility.If we do not like the legislation that is currently in effect, change it.If we do not like the criteria because DOD says it is too onerous, it istoo burdensome, change the criteria.But the answer, it seems to me, is not just to cut Congress out, is notto eliminate us altogether so that we have no voice, no veto, no participatoryrole in deciding whether or not a base that we helped to fund, is now beingshut down with fairly serious consequences, not only to the national securityinterest, but to the local economic interest as well.It seems to me we have a voice and we have to play a role. What we aredoing here is typical of what we do everytime we have a tough decisionto make, be it on Social Security or any other issue. We say, ``Let's createa commission, let's just abdicate o<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ur<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> responsibility and go to a commission.'' Far betterthat we come to the floor and say that each base that we recommend, wecan justify its closure. It is not political; it is in the national securityinterest; yes, there are costs involved and here they are and we are askingfor your support.That is the way it ought <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>to<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> be done, but Congress is taking the cowardly wayout in my judgment by simply shifting this off to a commission, and myfriend from Illinois is trying his best to involve Congress back in theprocess. But we have all of these permutations we are trying to achievein order to really duck the issue, and the fac<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> is we are the ones who create these bases, and weare the ones who ought <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>to<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> have a voice at least, some role in deciding whetherwe shut them down, under what circumstances, and with how much notice.<ITAG tagnum="80">The original legislation requires 60-day notice. Why? To give Membersof Congress an opportunity to make their case as to why the base oughtto stay open, if they can. We just passed major legislation giving 60 daysnotice for plant closings with the private sector shutting down operations.Congress went on record overwhelmingly in favor of that. And yet here weare<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> when it comes to shutting down a base<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> for which Congress bears the resp<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>o<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>nsibility of funding, we are saying, ``Don't cometo us; we can't afford to bear that kind of responsibility.'' </ITAG>So I think what has t<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ken place in the bill itself is a mistake. I commendmy colleague from Illinois for trying <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>at<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> least to make the kinds of modifications<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>which would give Congress some role as far as oversight,some participatory role, some check to make sure that it is not based uponpolitical factors in the sense one base is favored over another dependingon who is on a particular committee, or one regi<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>o<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>n over another. Base it upon national security interests.Also take into account at least some of the economic factors: The Air Forcesaid we will save millions of dollars in shutting a base down. The factsare quite the other way. So I think that the Senator from Illinois has done a commendable job, butwe are trying to patch up what essentially is a cowardly way out for thecongress and that is that we will not measure up to the responsibilityof whether we keep a base<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>open or shut it down. We are taking ourselves outof the process. I think it is a mistake. We have done it on other toughissues. I think we are paid to make those tough decisions and we oughtnot be delegating them to commissions that are not elected and unaccountableto us. Again I commend the Senator. I join in the effort. I commend Senator <T4>Levin. </T4>But I think it is a mistake to have done what we have done,and I hope the House will look very carefully before they agree to acceptthe Senate version.[S10MY8-356]{S5364}DIXONMr. DIXON addressed the Chair.The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. <T4>Simon</T4>). The Senator from Illinois.[S10MY8-357]{S5364}DIXONMr. DIXON. Mr. President, may I simply say that I endorse every word ofthe distinguished Senator from Maine. Were it up to this Senator, pages161 through 171 would not be in the Department of Defense authorizationbill. We fought that fight in committee and those 10 pages are in the bill.We fought this fight on the floor for a couple of days. We have achievedthe best accommodation we could under the circumstances. Even the congressionalinput ultimately I would have the other way around, with approval, notdisapproval, not the problems you are going to have with a veto and thatsort of thing.It is not all I wanted. At the same time, we have to resolve this thing,and I think it is clear that there is probably a majority here that wantsa strong, useful provision in the bill. I think this is the best we cando.I say to my friend from Maine, his valuable suggestions yesterday havebeen very helpful to this Senator. Some of the suggestions he gave me justbefore we entered into this whole subject matter yesterday were most usefulto me, and I thank the Senator from Maine. We have employed his adviceat every juncture in our discussions with the advocates of the other positionon this issue, and I thank him for his help and that of the Senator fromMichigan and others.So far as I am concerned, Mr. President, this constitutes the best we cando with the problem that I think everyone recognizes is a national problem.I think there ought to be more congressional input than there is. I thinkthere ought to be more congressional influence on the <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>C<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ommission than there is. I think there ought to bemore concern about the foreign bases than there is in this compromise,but in the end it is a compromise, the best we could do, and I recommendit as being adequate for this purpose in the Senate. M<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ay<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> I say to my fri<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>nd from Maine, I hope that in the conference moremodifications that make good sense can take place<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>.<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> I thank my friend from Maine.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.[S10MY8-358]{S5365}McCAINMr. <T4>McCAIN. <CODE-213>5</CODE-213></T4><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Mr. President, I think my friend from Maine was entirelyaccurate in his remarks. The Congress has probably abdicated its responsibilitiesand the Congress is responsible for the funding of these bases. However,I would like to point out to my friend, for whom I have the utmost respect,that it is very clear that we are at a condition of gridlock as far asbase closings are concerned. My information is that the last major militaryfacility in this country to be closed was in the early 1970's. A greatdeal has changed in the intervening years, and there have clearly <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>been<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> changes in mission, roles, requirements; technology.These have driven us to need different installations and different basingrequirements. All of <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>the<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> changes however, have not led to the closure ofany major military installation in this country. Whether we in this bodyhappen to like it or not, there is a perception around the <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>country<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> that the Congress cannot act to reduce the wasteand inefficiency and the excess expenditure of taxpayers' dollars whichresults from <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>having<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> redundant or excess military installations in thiscountry.My colleague is right that <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>in<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> saying that by setting up a commission, and allowingthat commission to do the work Congress should be doing, we are abdicatingour responsibilities. At the same time, I think history indicates thatwe are <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>incapable<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> of acting in any other way because of the enormouspolitical repercussions which result in each of our States as a resultof a move to close a base or a military installation.I would also like to point out to my friend that we have set up other commissionsand they have provided us with useful information<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>.<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> For example, the Commission on Social Security.This Commission was set up rec<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ntly and is going to report on the overall economysometime this fall.[S10MY8-359]{S5365}COHENMr. COHEN. Will the Senator yield?[S10MY8-360]{S5365}McCAINMr. <T4>McCAIN. </T4>Yes.[S10MY8-361]{S5365}COHENMr. COHEN. We also set up the Packard Commission a year or so ago, butthere was no suggestion made that the Packard Commission recommendationswould be implemented without review of the Congress. <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>T<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>here is something where we said, ``No, no, wait amoment. Procurement, that is something we take a special interest in.''We were not about to delegate that responsibility to the Packard Commission,notwithstanding the integrity of the members, the high respect that theyenjoyed, and the expertise they brought to the job. It seems to me thatwe did precisely the right thing. We took the benefit of their recommendations.We acted upon some and we rejected others. It seems to me that is the role of a commission, not to delegate to anunelected body the decisionmaking authority without review and withoutrecourse by Members of this institution. [S10MY8-362]{S5365}McCAINMr. <T4>McCAIN. </T4>I think the Senator is correct in that statement, butI would like to point out that the results of the Packard Commission, atleast in the minds of many of us, have been limited in the benefits wehave received. The so-called Kissinger Commission on the CBI was perhapsthe most talked-about and least followed Commission. Unfortunately, weseem to have a history of appointing commissions, expending the valuabletime of some of our most distinguished Americans, receiving their recommendations,and doing very little about them. [S10MY8-363]{S5365}COHENMr. COHEN. If the Senator will yield further, I would be prepared to acceptthe Senate Armed Services Committee language if the Senator from Arizonawould agree that we make the Scowcroft Commission recommendations to Congressbinding upon the Congress so that we could go forward, for example, withthe Midgetman missile as well as the recommendations on the MX.There is a case where we have distinguished gentlemen appointed by thePresident making recommendations to the Congress and I would be happy todelegate to them that decision, if the Senator from Arizona would joinme in saying he would be fully in support of those recommendations. [S10MY8-364]{S5365}McCAINMr. <T4>McCAIN. </T4>I certainly would not be adverse to giving serious considerationto such a move although, as my colleague fully appreciates, it would belargely academic. There would be 2 of us as opposed to 98, and we wouldhave <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ome difficulty in c<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>o<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>nvincing the other 98. [S10MY8-365]{S5365}COHENMr. COHEN. The only point I am making is here you had a commission makea recommendation, and Congress justifiably reserved the judgment as towhether we go forward with MX, Midgetman, or a combination of the two.I think we create commissions for the purposes of advice. They serve anadvisory function. That should be the desire here, but we should not abdicateour responsibility just as we have not done so with other commissions.I do not believe <ITAG tagnum="80">we should do so here. </ITAG>That is the only point I wish to make as a rhetorical suggestion. I knowthe Senator is not in the position to commit other Members to that position.But nonetheless, I think we have a role. The Senator from Illinois has done his best to inject the Congress backinto that deliberative process. I salute him for that. [S10MY8-366]{S5365}McCAINMr. <T4>McCAIN. </T4>I again appreciate the comments of my friend from Maine.He makes an extremely valid point in that we have abdicated our responsibility.Perhaps we should evaluate the way that this entire body does business.I would like to repeat and emphasize that it is thanks to the efforts ofthe Senator from Illinois that at least we have Congress playing a constructiverole. Admittedly, it is somewhat in the form of a two-House legislativeveto, as opposed to an affirmative action, in the case decisions and recommendationsmade by the commission. I would also like to remind my friend from Maine that there is that p<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>er<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ception, and I think there is an accurate one inthe country, that the Congress cannot act to close a single military installationbecause of the political impact on the elected representatives in bothbodies. History indicates there is some accuracy in th<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>at<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> perception. If my information is correct, the lasttime a major installation was closed was some 15 years ago, or more. Ifwe accept the fact that there are installations which should be streamlinedor made more efficient, and that some should even be closed, this billis a way of attacking an issue that is for more important than just thefact that there are bases which are not necessary to maintain this Nation'snational security requirements. If we cannot act, I greatly fear that thesupport for whatever level of defense spending the Congress decides onwill be eroded. The American people <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>need <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>to perceive that their tax dollars are not beinginefficiently and wastefully expended on military installations that arenot necessary for nation defense. I share the disapproval of my friend from Illinois, and to some degreehis disgust, that we are in a situation that we cannot act in an affirmativefashion, and that we abdicate our responsibilities. At the same time I would suggest that we have another pressing problem,and that is to convince most of the taxpayers of this country their taxdollars are being most wisely and efficiently spent. [S10MY8-367]{S5365}COHENMr. COHEN. Would the Senator yield for one final point? The times, of course,change. There may be requirements to either realign or indeed close certainbases. But I would call my colleague's attention to the fact that he, asdid I, on<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ce<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> served in the House of Representatives. A reportwas filed by the House Armed Services Committee some years ago in the mid-1970'sindicating as a policy matter that we needed to maintain, perhaps evenexpand, o<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ur <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>military presence in the country, and a greater dispersalwas taking place as more bases were being concentrated in fewer areas tothe point where many regions of the country were being totally excludedfrom any presence of our military personnel, men and women. And that thepresence of those men and women in our armed services was serving a verypositive impact, not only for our national security but for the commitmentof this country to a strong national defense. There was a policy decision to maintain a greater dispersal of those facilities.I think frankly there was great merit to it, that they are sometimes shortsightedfor very marginal savings to start shutting bases do<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>wn<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>, and thereby depriving an opportunity for peopleto see exactly the kind of services that are being rendered. So there was a policy recommendation coming from our colleague. I believe<T4>Jack Kemp </T4>was very instrumental in helping write that report.So it is not a situation where Congress has been resisting base closures.There were also policy factors involved and perhaps reasons for keepingthem open as part of the national security debate itself. I do not want to disagree with my friend from Arizona, but I would saythere are times when cases can be made for the closure of a base. Certainlywhen you are talking about a major installation, the way the law was originallywritten there had to be at l<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ea<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>st 1,000 civilian personnel who were proposed tobe eliminated or a 50-percent reduction. You are talking about a majorinstallation. There ought to be so<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>me<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> notice given, some rationale given, some opportunityfor Congress men and women and Sena<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>to<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>rs to<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> ma<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ke their case for its continuation. If they cannot,it should be closed. But it seems to me that is the process we ought tofollow, not what we are doing here by creating unelected commissions tomake those decisions for us. I think this is the best we can do under thecircumstances. So I will support certainly my colleagues from Illinois and Michigan. [S10MY8-368]{S5366}McCAINMr. <T4>McCAIN. </T4>I agree with my friend from Maine in that there is a compellingcase for dispersal throughout the country of our military installations.It is a terrible mistake, from a strategic as well as a moral standpoint,to concentrate our military bases in one section of the country. Indeed,that happens to be to a large degree the case today. I think that it couldplace us in some strategic peril over time.I would also like to point out that there has been no more fierce or dedicatedprotector of the military installations in his State in my view than mycolleague from the State of Maine.Those of us who come from the Sun Belt have many other ways of improvingour economies. Unfortunately, that does not happen to be true in the Stateof Maine, and my colleague from Maine is clearly aware and appreciativeof the enormous economic dislocation and difficulties that would prevailin his State in the event of a closure of a very large and important militaryinstallation.I happen to know that since 1979, when Senator <T4>Cohen </T4>came to this body, he has made it one of his highest prioritiesto keep that base open. I am sure the people of Maine are v<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>er<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>y grateful and appreciat<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>iv<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>e. He has made a compelling case not only of theeconomic difficulties that would result from base closures, but of thestrategic importance of the major military installation, in Maine, LoringAir Force <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Ba<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>se.[S10MY8-369]{S5366}COHENMr. COHEN. If I may offer one comment, let me thank the Senator for hiscomments, but point <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>out <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>that were it only the economic factors involved Iwould not be before this Chamber speaking on behalf of that particularfacility. It was the strategic location, the implications for reinforcementand NATO, that the whole rationale was offered for the base in the firstplace. The primary factor has to be the consideration of national securityinterests. The economic factors were secondary, <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>in <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>my opinion, and no less important in terms of theimpact. But I could not stand before this Chamber and urge my colleaguesto keep it open solely as a job creation facility.So it was really the strategic location, coupled with the economic factors,that would be involved in shutting it down for very marginal, if any, economicsavings, and I think to the detriment of our ability to reinforce our Europeanallies at a time of crisis that really has been the persuasive factor thathas maintained Loring where it is today.[S10MY8-370]{S5366}McCAINMr. <T4>McCAIN. </T4>As I was saying, I believe my friend from Maine has madethe case for the strategic importance of Loring Air Force Base. It is indeedcrucial <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>to<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> our ability to resupply our NA<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>TO<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> allies in the event of war in Western Europe. Hehas based his primary concerns on that issue.I was trying to point out that he also has concern for the working menand women of his State, who would find it very difficult to find employmentin other areas.

Mr. President, I commend the distinguished Senator from Illinoisand the Senators from Michigan, Arizona, Virginia, and other Senators whohave been working on this for a number of hours. I think it is a very importantstep in the right direction. As the Senator from Maine point out, nationalsecurity has to be primary.I can recall in 1965, when I was a young House Member, they closed SchillingAir Force Base in Salina, KS. I called each of my Senators to see who wasgoing to make the announcement. I could not find one Senator, and the otherSenator said, ``I only announce openings.'' [Laughter.]So I was a junior House Member, and I got to announce the closing of SchillingAir Force Base in Kansas. As it turned out, we had economic development,and it turned out well from the standpoint of the community.I understand the importance of making the right decision, and that hasbeen the purpose of this amendment. I certainly commend those who havebeen involved.I hope we can close some bases. Obviously, there are some that should havebeen closed 10, 15, or 20 years ago, in addition to Schilling Air ForceBase, and later the Air Force base in Topeka, KS. We do not have many left.I support the amendment, and I congratulate the sponsor of the amendment.[S10MY8-382]<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>{S5367}<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>DIXONMr. DIXON.

Mr. President, this year under the v<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ry able leadership of our chairman, Senator<T4> Nunn,</T4> the Armed Services Committee worked in a bipartisan spiritof cooperation to develop a defense authorization bill that:Begins to get control of runaway defense spending;Seriously addresses the imbalance between strategic and conventional priorities;Makes a start at correcting deficiencies in our conventional deterr<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>nt; andProvides a number of initiatives to strengthen the defense industrial base,improve acquisition practices and address defense trade policies that resultin the inefficient use of common defense resources.During the course of our hearings and deliberations on this bill the committee,and particularly Senator<T4> Levin</T4>'s Subcommittee on Conventional Forces and Alliance Defense,focused considerable attention on the subject of the conventional balancebetween NATO and the Warsaw Pact forces arrayed against each other in Europe.<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>The committee recommends that additional funds be authorized over and abovethe President's request for a number of armor and antiarmor programs thatwill begin to restore the ability of our forces to better deter and defendagainst a conventional attack on Europe.<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>We have made a good beginning at addressing the conventional balance inEurope and correcting imbalances that detract from our ability to deterwar and defend against attack in that most vital region of the world, andI congratulate my colleagues on the committee, the members of the committeestaff, and the personal staff members who have worked with us to preparethis bill for the Senate's consideration.But I would be remiss if I did not remind the Senate that providing forthe common defense involves more than raising and supporting armies orproviding and maintaining a Navy. The pursuit of negotiated and verifiablearms control agreements, though a function of the executive branch, isalso a concern of the Congress, especially of the Senate which must giveits advice in and consent to that process.While the committee's actions to improve conventional defense capabilitiesare important_and necessary at this time_I think the committee has giveninsufficient attention to a number of possible actions that could enhanceconventional stability and increase the warning time for any Warsaw Pactattack that would be<ITAG tagnum="80">so necessary to enable NAT<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>O<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>'s member governments to make the political decisionsto mobilize reserves and reinforce the forward deployed forces of NATO.</ITAG>The actions to which I refer can be categorized as conventional arms controland stabilizing measures_with the latter term encompassing both confidence-buildingmeasures [CBM<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>'<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>s], of the sort agreed to at the Stockholm Conferencein 1986 which was part of the Conference on Confidence-<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>and Security-Building Measures an<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>d <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Disarmament in Europe [CDE], and force constraints.The committee's formal report to the Foreign Relations Committee on theINF Treaty recognized the promise of such measure<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>, identifying them collectively as components ofthe second track of the roadmap to NATO stren<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>g<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>th in the report's section on ``NATO in the Post-INFEnvironment.'' The committee gave further indication of its appreciationfor the potential of conventional arms control and stabilizing measureswhen it adopted my amendment to this bill, cosponsored by Senators <T4>Nunn </T4>and <T4>Levin, </T4>expressing the sense of the Congress that an expansionof confidence-building measures should enjoy a high priority in the administration'splans to proceed with conventional arms control initiatives in Europe.Nevertheless, much more can be done in this area.To date, what attention the United States and NATO arms control negotiatorshave devoted to stabilizing measures has focused on confidence-buildingmeasures of the Stockholm Agreement genre.That <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>greement permits each side to observe and inspectmilitary operations of the othe<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>r <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>side. These inspections and observations are viewedwith great promise in Europe.Two new rounds of Western bloc-Eastern bloc talks are anticipated to beginlater this year: a follow-on to the CDE talks and the resulting StockholmAgreement; and a new series of talks, the Conventional Stability Talks[CST].Enhanced CMB<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>'<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>s will be discussed at the follow-on to the Stockholmmeeting. Force constraints as well as force reductionis can be consideredin the framework of the CST.Since becoming a member of the Arm<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>d Service<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> Committee last year, I have devoted a great dealof attention to this subject and have concluded that expanding the currentregimen of CBM<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>'<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>s to include force constraints and limitations wille<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>n<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>h<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>anc<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>e our conventional defense system in Europe, providesome early success in the new discussions, and build the infrastructurefor a verification regime for future conventional disarmament.Taking such steps_which some have labled ``operational <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ar<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ms control''_will be stabilizing, beneficial to thesecurity of the Western alliance and its members, and more easily achievablethan <ITAG tagnum="80">actual reductions in weapons systems or forces_traditional arms control_or``structural'' arms control.</ITAG>IN the area of Stockholm-type CBM<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>'<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>s, we should consider a number of new initiativesat both the CDE and CST negotiations. For example:We should seek an increase in the number of demand inspections permittedannually;We should attempt to expand the scope of activities subject to inspectionand observation. All military operations, including movements of aviationunits and naval maneuvers, should be brought under the provisions of theStockholm Agreement in ways that enhance mutual security;Building on the intrusive inspection regime of the INF Treaty, we shouldattempt to estab<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>l<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ish on-site monitoring facilities at the entrancesto major rail yards, ammunition and fuel storage depots, and internationaltransshipment points.A different kind of CBM we should pursue immediately is the exchange ofNATO and Warsaw Pact officers for the purposes of discussing strategy anddoctrine and breaking down barriers to better understanding between thecompeting alliances. Both sides contribute to the continuing suspicionand distrust:Throughout the post-war period the Soviet Union has maintained forces inEastern Europe, and in the Western portions of the Soviet Union, deployed,equipped, and trained in a manner to facilitate offensive operations.Despite recent encouraging rhetoric from Soviet officials, the Soviet Union'sforces remain guided by an offensive doctrine and appear to be implementingthat doctrine.United States and other NATO forces are also forward deployed and offensive-capable,and the Warsaw Pact claims it believes NATO has offensive intentions andobjectives.Recent changes in U.S. doctrine_such as shifting from active defense toAirLand Battle_and the adoption of the <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>f<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ollow-<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>on<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>f<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>orces <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ttac<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>k<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> [FOFA] doctrine by NATO apparently are a matterof considerable concern to the Soviets and their allies.NATO and Warsaw Pact officers I met in Europe, including General Galvin,the SACEUR; General Otis, USAREUR Commander; and General Dachowski, FirstDeputy Chief of Staff of the Polish Army, told me that they would welcomeexchanges and the opportunity to discuss concerns about each other's doctrine.As we become more familiar with the other side's doctrine, we can use theseexchanges to help us discriminate between routine and premobilization ormobilization activities. ultimately, we can use the exchange of informationon strategy and doctrine to reduce border tension.The first steps toward instituting such exchanges between senior NATO andWarsaw Pact officers already has occured. Secretary of Defense Carlucciand Soviet Defense Minister Yazov's recent meeting will be followed byan exchange of visits between Admiral Crowe and his Soviet counterpartMarshal Akhromeyev. We should seek to expand on these meetings and makethem routine.All of these measures could reduce tension and the possibility for misunderstandingand misinterpretation of the other side's activities while simultaneouslyincreasing warning time and certainty in case of Pact mobilization. Exchangesbetween NATO and Warsaw Pact officers and an expanded regimen of CBM<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>'<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>s need not wait for tangible reductions or<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>redeployment of conventional forces.Finally, given the prospect that the new conventional stability talks willtake several years to produce any actual force reductions, we should attemptto negotiate force constraints and limitations which, along with enhancedCBM<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>'<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>s, could serve as stepping stones toward actual reductionsin Warsaw Pact and NATO conventional forces.Such measures would be aimed at complicating preparations for short-warningattacks, making unreinforced offensive operations less feasible, and installinga variety of cooperative inspection procedures that could help monitorcompliance with any eventual arms <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>reduction<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> accord.Such measures would give both sides the opportunity to demonstrate in tangibleways that their intentions and objectives are truly defensive.Such force constraints are still in the early stages of conceptual developmentin the West. In the past, we have seen constraints largely as measuresto accompany and augment arms reduction accords. We do not yet know whichones most effectively would reduce the options for attack while preservingthe legitimate capabilities for defense.A number of ideas appear worth exploring. For example:<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>W<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>e could consider setting limitations on the sizeof maneuver units, making it more difficult in exercises to prepare thesorts of formations necessary for attack;We could also seek constraints on the time that maneuver units spend outof garrison, a measure that <CODE-213>5</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><ITAG tagnum="80">would build confidence in stated intentions as well as inhibit attackpotential; </ITAG>Another useful measure to consider would be establishing limits on thenumber and size of maneuver units that could be moved into specified geographicareas from other regions; We should look into the possibility of negotiating restrictions on thelocation of fuel and ammunition depots, ensuring that such facilities arenot located near the East-West dividing line. These and other measures, might require asymmetrical limitations to takeinto account the much greater geographic depth of the Eastern side. Moving closer to actual arms reductions, we should explore schemes fortaking certain equipment out of units and storing it in depots monitoredby the other side. Logical candidates for storage include tanks, self-propelled artillery,and bridging equipment. The engines could be removed from the tanks andstored separately, requiring additional time to bring the units back intoservice and increasing the visibility of any a<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>gg<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ressive intentions. Storing equipment, taking into account the need to equalize imbalancesin current deployments of such systems, would not require destruction ofthose systems. But storage arrangements could complicate any preparationsto attack the other side with short warning. Such measures, if negotiated, could help establish patterns of East-Westsecurity cooperation that would improve the prospects for actual reductions.Perhaps more importantly, by limiting the potential of the Warsaw Pactto mount an attack on short-warning, such measures would permit the NATOcountries to concentrate resources on defending against other scenarios.The early negotiation, implementation, and use of confidence building measuresand of force constraints and limitations could help stab<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>il<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ize the military situation in Europe, reduce therisk of war_conventional or nuclear_between NATO and the Warsaw Pact, facilitateprogress toward arms reduction agreements, and build the foundation forthe verification regime<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>n<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> such accords would require. Confidence building measures can play a crucial role in furthering progressin United States-Soviet relations in the arena of strategic arms, as wellas in the European/conventional arena.Already there have been discussions between President Reagan and SovietGeneral Secretary Gorbachev concerning inspections of each other's lasertechnology developments_in the hope that such confidence building stepscan ease the concerns of both sides sufficiently to permit us to achievea substantial reduction in strategic nuclear weapons. I understand thatthe summit-level discussions have been followed up with staff-level discussions.This appears to offer considerable promise for sidestepping some of theproblems that the President's strategic defense initiative_SDI_have posedfor the progress in the start talks that so many hope will be successfulin the very near future. It is yet another example of how confidence-buildingmeasures and force constraints can play central roles not only in reducingtensions and facilitating more relaxed relations between the United Statesand the Soviet Union in and of themselves, while assuring that our nationalsecurity is fully protected_but also in smoothing the way toward true armsreductions which is the ultimate objective of our arms control efforts.As we consider the committee's recommendations on authorizations for theDepartment of Defense for fiscal year 1989 we should be mindful that nationalsecurity involves more than forces and weapons. The INF Treaty, which wewill consider shortly, is the first step in a new directioon to enhancenational security. The active pursuit of responsible arms control combinedwith a balanced national defense establishment in support of a clear setof national security priorities is the surest guarantor of our continuedpeace and prosperity.Mr. President, I yield the floor.[S10MY8-386]{S5368}DIXONMr. DIXON.

The Senator from South Dakota, Senator <T4>Pressler,</T4> I believe would like to have an amendment on the samesubject relating to base closing. I believe that will require a rollcallvote. We have been trying to line up business all day and we have beenspinning our wheels to some<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>extent, except this will be one of the most importantareas we will be discussing. I hope with the Pressler amendment we willbe completed with this one.Tomorrow morning I would like to have what I will call the bigger amendmentsup so we can make progress on this bill. The Senator from Louisiana, Senator<T4>Johnston</T4>, has agreed to bring up his SDI amendment at approximately10:30 in the morning. That <ITAG tagnum="80">could be our first order of business. Then we have Mr. </ITAG><T4>Bumpers</T4> who is willing to bring up the amendment on SALT whichwe are all familiar with, I think, and then we follow that, the Johnstonamendment, with the Bumpers amendment. It is my understanding that Senator <T4>Kennedy</T4> will be prepared to bring up two amendments, includingan amendment on the test ban, which is another one of the big ones, andthat those two can come up t<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>om<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>orrow also. So that is four amendments that are in the big 10, as I would say.[S10MY8-401]{S5369}HEINZMr. HEINZ. Will the <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>Senator<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> yield? [S10MY8-402]{S5369}NUNNMr. NUNN. Yes. [S10MY8-403]{S5369}HEINZMr. HEINZ. Sometime tomorrow afternoon, I will be prepared to bring upan <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>amendment<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> having to do with the elimination of the domesticpreference by DOD that was stricken in the committee. [S10MY8-404]{S5369}NUNNMr. NUNN. Does the <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>Senator<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> want to go further in eliminating the preference,or does the <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>Senator<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> want to go in the other direction? [S10MY8-405]{S5369}HEINZMr. HEINZ. I think the <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>Senator<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> understands many of us__[S10MY8-406]{S5369}NUNNMr. NUNN. I understand. I have been heard on that subject myself. I believethe <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>Senator<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> from California has an <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>amendment<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> that relates to base housing. [S10MY8-407]{S5369}WILSONMr. WILSON. That is correct. Since the <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>Senator<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> is talking about tomorrow, <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>Senator<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213><T4>D'Amato</T4> and I and others will be offering an <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>amendment<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>, and we have no idea how much time it will take,that relates to the military powers for the interdiction of drugs on thesouthern border of the United States. [S10MY8-408]{S5369}NUNNMr. NUNN. That is also, I would say, one of the big <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>amendment<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>s, I would like to take that one up. I would liketo proceed in this order, but if you could be ready on that one perhapstomorrow afternoon. [S10MY8-409]{S5369}WILSONMr. WILSON. That will be fine. [S10MY8-410]{S5369}NUNNMr. NUNN. We can certainly take that up tomorrow, I hope. I say to themajority leader, we have a very full day tomorrow. We have a number ofimportant <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>amendment<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>s. That makes 5 of the big 10 <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>amendment<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>s. That is one of them here. That is six of them,if we can have that agenda, we can dispose of by tomorrow, and perhapsmany others. I would like to have the SDI <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>amendment<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> laid down tonight as the first order tomorrow morning.[S10MY8-411]{S5369}BYRDMr. BYRD. Mr. President, as I understand the distinguished chairman, Mr.<T4>Weicker</T4> will shortly call up an <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>amendment<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> which will not require a rollcall, unless he, theofferor__[S10MY8-412]{S5369}WEICKERMr. WEICKER. No rollcall. [S10MY8-413]{S5369}BYRDMr. BYRD. It has been indicated there will be no rollcall vote on that.Then Mr. <T4>Pressler</T4> has an amendment which the chairman would hope to disposeof today and which would require a rollcall vote. Is Mr. <T4>Pressler</T4> prepared to call it up?[S10MY8-414]{S5369}DOLEMr. DOLE. Will the majority leader yield? We are in the process of cont<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>cting Senator <T4>Pressler.</T4> I think he is attending a reception. We are sendinga messenger to see if he will come and present his amendment.[S10MY8-415]{S5369}WARNERMr. WARNER. I might advise the leadership, he has told me he does wanta rollcall vote.[S10MY8-416]{S5369}BYRDMr. BYRD. And he will call it up after Mr. <T4>Weicker</T4>'s amendment.[S10MY8-417]{S5369}DOLEMr. DOLE. There is no time limit. It could take an hour or 2 hours.[S10MY8-418]{S5369}WARNERMr. WARNER. Mr. President, my estimate is the Pressler amendment can takeless than half an hour.[S10MY8-419]{S5369}BYRDMr. BYRD. There will be one more rollcall vote today. I wonder if we canget agreements that the following amendments will be locked in? May I askthe distinguished Republican leader and manager on that side, would itbe possible to lock in the amendments which have been enumerated by Mr.<T4>Nunn</T4> in the following order: Mr. <T4>Johnston,</T4> beginning at 10 o'clock, to be followed by the amendmentby Mr. <T4><CODE-213>5</CODE-213>B<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>umpers,</T4> to be followed by two amendments byMr. <T4>Kennedy,</T4> to be followed by the amendments by Mr. <T4>Heinz</T4> and Mr. <T4>Wilson.</T4>[S10MY8-420]{S5370}NUNNMr. NUNN. Mr. <T4>Heinz</T4> and then Mr. <T4>Wilson.</T4>[S10MY8-421]{S5370}BYRDMr. BYRD. Mr. <T4>Heinz</T4> and then Mr. <T4>Wilson</T4> without any time limitations.[S10MY8-422]{S5370}DOLEMr. DOLE. Without any other limitations, like second-degree amendments;just the order is all we are talking about?[S10MY8-423]{S5370}BYRDMr. BYRD. In other words, there could be amendments in the second-degreeoffered to them but no time limitations. At least we would have a sequencein which amendments would be called up, and that sequence has been rathercarefully worked out today by the manager and ranking manager.This would mean that on tomorrow, we could begin at 10 o'clock and havean orderly procedure whereby these amendments would be called up and theSenators who are offering the amendments would be put on notice they wouldbe expected to be on the floor offering their amendments.[S10MY8-424]{S5370}STEVENSMr. STEVENS. Will the distinguished leader yield on that point?[S10MY8-425]{S5370}BYRDMr. BYRD. Yes.[S10MY8-426]{S5370}STEVENSMr. STEVENS. I do not have any objection to the order. I would like toknow if we can have an indication of what are the subject matters of theseamendments because individual Senators have several different amendments,and I would like to know what the order is, if we can have that. Maybewe can know more information about whether we should be here.[S10MY8-427]{S5370}BYRDMr. BYRD. I will ask Mr. <CODE-213>5</CODE-213><T4><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Nunn <CODE-213>5</CODE-213></T4><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>to respond.[S10MY8-428]{S5370}NUNNMr. NUNN. I think the Senator from Alaska is certain<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ly<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> entitled to that information. My understanding isSenator <T4>Johnston</T4> will have an amendment on SDI that will transfer certainfunds from SDI to the NASA Program. I am not sure of the amount. I believeit is $700 million.Mr. <CODE-213>5</CODE-213><T4><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>B<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>umpers<CODE-213>0</CODE-213></T4> will have the SALT II amendment compliancewhich we debated in this body several times. I think that one is prettymuch the same amendment we talked about last year. Senator <T4>Kennedy</T4> will have an amendment on the test ban, which is alsoan amendment we have discussed in the past and voted on in the past. Ibelieve Senator <T4>Kennedy</T4> has also indicated he will have an amendment which hasbeen discussed in the past and I believ<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>vot<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ed<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> on in the past relating to combat troops in CentralAmerica. I am not sure of the exact nature of that one.Does Senator <T4>Kennedy</T4> want to describe that amendment?[S10MY8-429]{S5370}KENNEDYMr. KENNEDY. I have two amendments. One is an amendment which we have consideredbefore about American combat troops in Central America requiring actionby the Congress. We have visited that issue a number of times, so I thinkwe can dispose of it in a relatively short period of time.The other deals with threshold limits on nuclear testing. We have debatedthis issue previously. It would be somewhat different from the testingamendment debated in the House of Representatives. It would basically followthe testing limitation bill that we introduced last year, incorporatingsome new material contained in a forthcoming OTA report<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>.<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>I will be glad to ensure that both amendments will be filed tonight sothe Members will be able to examine them. We have visited both those amendmentson other occasions. But, I think those matters ought to be debated hereon the floor. At an appropriate time, I will be glad to enter into a timeagreement on both of those measures.Then I indicated to the leader that on Thursday morning I will proposean amendment requiring that retirement of older aircraft carriers be phasedso as to maintain our current level of 14 carriers, until 1997, ratherthan expanding the force to 15 carriers in 1990.[S10MY8-430]{S5370}NUNNMr. NUNN. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts. If I can further add,it is my understanding the Heinz amendment relates to a ``buy American''provision which had been in the law formerly, which has been stricken andsubstituted in our bill.He is attempting to amend the bill, attempting to add back the ``buy American''provision. It is my understanding Senator <T4>Wilson's</T4> amendment relates to drugs, and he will be joined byMr. <T4>D'Amato,</T4> relating to military involvement in fighting drugs.We are not asking for time limits on any of these amendments tonight. Weare not asking for blocking of second-degree amendments tonight. We aretrying to get some order. Once we see the amendments and people are familiarwith them, tomorrow we might shoot for some time agreement, but it wouldbe helpful and will expedite the activity on this floor if we can get thissequence.[S10MY8-431]{S5370}DIXONMr. DIXON. Will the manager yield for one question, please, Mr. President?Would it be an accurate statement of this manager that anybody who hasan amendment that can be agreed to we would continue to deal with fromtime to time through the day?[S10MY8-432]{S5370}NUNNMr. NUNN. That is right.[S10MY8-433]{S5370}DIXONMr. DIXON. To make that clear, the shop is open for business for thoseamendments we can take.[S10MY8-434]{S5370}STEVENSMr. STEVENS. Mr. President, that was going to be my next question, whetherthis scheduling of amendments was to preclude amendments that could beagreed to.[S10MY8-435]{S5370}NUNNMr. NUNN. We would try to work those amendments in during the day so whenwe have any lull in the other activity, we will keep Senators informedand Senators will let us know_Senator <T4>Warner <CODE-213>5</CODE-213></T4><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>and myself_which amendments they have and make surethey are cleared with staff.We will get in touch with Senators and let them know there is an opening,and they can come over and present them.I hope we will be able to handle these amendments and 8 or 10 others, ormore, tomorrow.[S10MY8-436]{S5370}STEVENSMr. STEVENS. Mr. President, one more item if I may. I think that the Senateshould know that the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee members have beendiscussing some amendments, and I know that Senator <T4>Stennis </T4>has some concerns. I have expressed some concerns. Wewould like to put Senators on notice that we may have some amendments thatwe will offer. We are not going to bring them up now and I see no reasonto list them in order at this time.[S10MY8-437]{S5370}NUNNMr. NUNN. I thank the Senator from Alaska. We will be glad to discuss themwith the Senator from Alaska.[S10MY8-438]{S5370}QUAYLEMr. QUAYLE. Will the Senator yield?[S10MY8-439]{S5370}WILSONMr. WILSON. Will the Senator yield?[S10MY8-440]{S5370}BYRDMr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have the floor. Does the Senator wish me toyield?[S10MY8-441]{S5370}WILSONMr. WILSON. Yes, I would appreciate that.Actually, I wanted the majority leader to yield to ask this question. AsI understand the order that is being proposed for tomorrow, it is the wishof the chairman and the majority leader to deal with some of the largeramendments. The amendment that the chairman described, having to do withschool construction, is one that I would therefore like to deal with tonight.Now, if that is not going to be accepted, then I will probably want a rollcallvote.[S10MY8-442]{S5370}NUNNMr. NUNN. I say to the Senator from California that that one will requiresome debate. I have not seen it, but I believe the committee will be opposingthat amendment. I had indicated that the Pressler amendment, if it comesup, would probably be the last rollcall of the evening, but I am preparedto stay if Senators want to stay and if the majority leader would liketo stay this evening.[S10MY8-443]{S5370}WILSONMr. WILSON. While I have no desire to keep anybody, it does not sound likethere is any room in tomorrow's schedule for that kind of rollcall vote.[S10MY8-444]{S5370}NUNNMr. NUNN. If we keep this agenda going tonight and tomorrow, we probablywill have a full agenda for tomorrow. I do not know whether the Senatorfrom South Dakota is going to present that amendment. If not, we couldperhaps use the time to discuss this amendment. But we had been waitinghere for a couple hours during this deliberation, and I would feel thatalthough there is no order on this, he would be entitled to be recognizedon his amendment just as a matter of taking it in sequence based on thediscussion we have already had on base closure, but I leave that up tothe leadership.[S10MY8-445]{S5371}BYRDMr. BYRD. Mr. President, my request has only to do with tomorrow. Couldwe have the request put?The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. <T4>Levin</T4>). Is there objection?[S10MY8-446]{S5371}DOLEMr. DOLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.[S10MY8-447]{S5371}DOLEMr. DOLE. As I understand, there will be at least four amendments sequencedtomorrow?[S10MY8-448]{S5371}BYRDMr. BYRD. Four or five or six, perhaps.[S10MY8-449]{S5371}NUNNMr. NUNN. I did not understand the question.[S10MY8-450]{S5371}DOLEMr. DOLE. If the Senat<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>or<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> will list the names of the amendments, I think weunderstand what they are.[S10MY8-451]{S5371}NUNNMr. NUNN. We have a Johnston amendment on SDI, a Bumpers amendment on SALT,a Kennedy amendment on Central America combat troops, a Kennedy amendmenton test ban, a Heinz amendment on buy American, and a Wilson amendmenton drugs. I believe that is six.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?[S10MY8-452]{S5371}QUAYLEMr. QUAYLE. Reserving the right to object__The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.[S10MY8-453]{S5371}QUAYLEMr. QUAYLE. What is the request?[S10MY8-454]{S5371}DOLEMr. DOLE. Just to bring them up in that order, no limit on debate. So wecan get something done.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection?[S10MY8-455]{S5371}NUNNMr. NUNN. Just a schedule, no time agreement.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Hearing none, it is so ordered.[S10MY8-456]{S5371}BYRDMr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank all Senators. [S10MY8-457]{S5371}DOLEMr. DOLE. I am advised the distinguished Senator from South Dakota maynot want to b<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ri<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ng up his amendment. Maybe we could bring up theamendment of the Senator from California. [S10MY8-458]{S5371}NUNNMr. NUNN. Let me suggest that we finish the Dixon amendment, which wasamended in the second degree. We have to complete the amendment as thepending business. Then the W<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ei<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>cker amendment has been waiting and we can handlethat one in about 5 minutes, and then get the amendment of the Senatorfrom California. [S10MY8-459]{S5371}BYRDMr. BYRD. May I ask, if there will be a rollcall vote yet today, that wouldbe on the Wilson amendment? [S10MY8-460]{S5371}NUNNMr. NUNN. It would be my view of it there would be a rollcall vote on it,but I have not looked at the amendment and we would have to reserve thatjudgment. But my guess is there will be. [S10MY8-461]{S5371}STEVENSMr. STEVENS. Will the leader yield on this point before he gives up thefloor? Do we have some idea how long the Wilson amendment is going to take?[S10MY8-462]{S5371}WILSONMr. WILSON. From my standpoint, it will take a very brief period of time.I would say, if you wanted to, we could set a time limit of 30 minu<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>te<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>s, and probably not use that. [S10MY8-463]{S5371}NUNNMr. NUNN. The problem is the committee has not seen the amendment so thereis no way we can enter into a time agreement. [S10MY8-464]{S5371}WILSONMr. WILSON. Copies have been furnished some time ago.[S10MY8-465]{S5371}NUNNMr. NUNN. We have not gotten a copy. We need a copy, if we can get one.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now occurs on the amendment of theSenator from Illinois, as modified, as amended. The amendment (No. 2005), as modified and as amended, was agreed to. [S10MY8-466]{S5371}DIXONMr. DIXON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the amendmentwas agreed to. [S10MY8-467]{S5371}SIMONMr. SIMON. I move to lay that motion on the table.

Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment related to airtravel expenses of defense contractor personnel.My amendment is very simple and straightforward.It consists of two provisions:First, it calls on the General Services Administration [GSA] to enter intonegotiations with the airlines for the purpose of achieving agreementsthat would make contractor personnel traveling in connection with defensecontracts eligible for the same discount airfares available to Governmentpersonnel traveling on official business.Second, once those agreements are negotiated, each Department of Defense[DOD] contract would contain a clause that would require contractor airtravel at prevailing Government discount rates.The amendment does not mandate the use of discount air fares by DOD contractors_unlessthe airlines agree to give them access to discount fares as a result ofnegotiations. The amendment will put pressure on DOD and GS<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>A<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> to seek negotiated agreements that cover DOD contractors.If the negotiations fail, then the contractors would not be required touse discount air far<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>s. But there is no reason why those negotiationsshould fail.As the Government's largest travel customer, DOD should have some leveragewith both the GSA and the airline industry.The genesis for my amendment is a recommendation made by the inspectorgeneral [IG] of the Department of Defense. It is contained in a DOD IGreport entitled<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>``Audit of Contractors' Use of Government TransportationRequests'' issued on May 12, 1987.The inspector general's audit was made in response to an allegation bya travel agency that DOD was losing $500 million annually by not requiringcontractors to use discount air fares available to Government personnel.To determine the validity of the allegation, the IG audit<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>d trips billed to the Government in 1985 by majordefense contractors.The DOD IG report found that defense contractors were not taking advantageof available discount air fares but determined that the alleged loss of$500 million per year was som<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>what overstated. The IG estimated that air travelcosts incurred by the major contractors could have been reduced by $135.1million through the use of discount air fares. The IG further concludedthat the admin<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>i<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>strative costs of implementing such a policy wouldbe minimal.In late 1987, the airlines withdrew agreements that permitted DOD contractorsworking on Government cost-reimbursable contracts to use discount air faresavailable to Government personnel. They did so for two reasons: First,concern over the volume of such travel, and second, concern about potentialabuse by contractor personnel.The DOD IG believes that the airlines' concerns are unfounded.The DOD IG contends that the volume of travel by contractor personnel isminuscule in relation to total airline passenger revenues. For calendaryear 1985, the 90 major defense contractors accounted for about 1.3 milliontrips costing $362 million in air fares_or less than 1 percent of totalairline revenues. Furthermore, existing statutory law contains ample penaltiesfor those who might attempt to abuse the system.The DOD IG believes that the airlines' concerns can and should be laidto rest and in December 1987 urged the Secretary of Defense to work withGSA to restore Government discount air fares for contractors.I have complete confidence in the integrity of the IG's office. If theDOD IG says the savings are there, the savings exist. I am sure of that.Now, there could be some disagreement as to the exact savings involved.Even if it is $100 million instead of $135 million, we are still talkingabout a considerable chunk of money. We cannot in good conscience ignorethe IG's recommendations. We have a responsibility to act on them, particularlyin view of impending cuts in defense and Secretary Carlucci's plan to carve$300 billion from the 5-year defense program.We must find ways to economize_to cut costs, and that is exactly what thisamendment wou<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>l<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>d do_so that the money saved could be used to buysomething the military really needs.Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the inspector general's reportand related documents be printed in the <T4>Record.</T4>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the<T4>Record, </T4>as follows:<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><ITAG tagnum="51"><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Inspector General, <CODE-213>1</CODE-213></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52"><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Department of Defense, <CODE-213>1</CODE-213></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="53"><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>A<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>rlington<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>, VA, March 2, 1988. <CODE-213>1</CODE-213></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="54"/><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Mr. <CODE-213>1</CODE-213><T4><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Charles Murphy, <CODE-213>1</CODE-213></T4><ITAG tagnum="55"><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Senate Rayburn Office Building, Washington, DC.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213> </ITAG>[S10MY8-480]<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>{S5372}<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Dear Mr. Murphy<CODE-213>1</CODE-213></T4><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>: This is in reply to your January 28, 1988 noteregarding potential cost savings from contractor's use of Government discountairfares.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>In July 1980, the General Services Administrationestablished the Federal Contract Airline Program to reduce the cost ofFederal Government employee travel in the United States.

The report described how DoDcould save $135 million of the estimated $362 million in annual air travelcosts that 90 major defense contractors incur in support of DoD contracts.Specifically, the report included recommendations for (1) expanding theuse of Government discount air fares under cost-reimbursable contracts(savings potential of $26.1 million), (2) arranging for the use of Governmentdisc<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>o<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>unt air fares for travel that would be a direct chargeunder fixed-price contracts along with all DoD related travel that willbe charged as indirect cost regardless of contract type (savings potentialof $61.6 million), and (3) expanding the routes subject to discount faresby considering the travel of the 90 major defense contractors in supportof Government business (savings potential of $47.4 million).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Your office agreed with the first recommendation, but expressed varyingdegrees of disagreement with the latter two recommendations. We had initiatedthe audit resolution process to resolve these disagreements. However, beforethe process could be completed, the major airlines withdrew the agreementsthat allowed contractors any use of Government discount air fares. Sincethe action precluded implementation of the recommendations, we closed thereport.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Discussions with the Director of Travel and Transportation Managementat the General Services Administration disclosed that the air carrierswithdrew their agreements because of two major concerns. One concern wasthe l<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ck of information on the number of trips that wouldbe covered by discount air fares. Another concern was the absence of controlsto prevent contractors from misusing discount air fares. To our knowledge,the General Services Administration has not taken or planned any actionsto resolve these concerns and regain agreements for contractor use of discountair fares.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">We believe there is good potential for resolving the airlines' concerns.Our report identified the amounts of contractor travel subject to the Governmentdiscount air fares. To illustrate, for calendar year 1985 the 90 majordefense contractors accounted for about 1.3 million trips involving $362million in air fares. These fares represent less than 1 percent of theairlines' total revenues. Updated contractor travel volume in the necessarydetail can be developed. To avoid contractor abuses of the discount fares,several avenues are available. One approach would be to apply Public Law98-473 (as amended), Section 641 of Title 18, United States Code whichprovides for up to a $10,000 fine or ten years of imprisonment, or both,for misuse of anything of value to the Government.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Although we are not pursuing resolution of the audit report, we arestill concerned that DoD may be missing a savings opportunity. As the Government'slargest travel customer, DoD sh<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>o<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>uld have some leverage with both the General ServicesAdministration and the airline industry.

The objective of the audit was to determine the validity ofthe allegation by determining the extent that General Services Administrationnegotiated contract air fares were available to DoD contractors for travelin support of their Government cost contractors and quantifying the potentialsavings. We also evaluated the potential for expanding contractors' useof the discount air fares to other types of Government contractors. Toaccomplish these objectives, we evaluated air travel incurred by 90 majorDefense contractors with collocated Service and Defense Logistics Agencyplant representative offices. In 1985, these contractors spent $466.5 millionfor air travel on commercial airlines, including $362 million in supportof Government contracts.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">We concluded that the allegation was valid in that Defense contractorswere not using the discount air fares when traveling in support of Governmentcost-reimbursable contracts. However, the alleged losses of $500 millionper year appeared to be overstated. Overall, we concluded that, in 1985,DoD could have reduced the $362 million incurred by the 90 Defense contractorsfor air travel in support of Government contracts by an estimated $135.1million if (1) available discount air fares were used on all travel chargedas direct costs on cost-reimbursable contracts ($26.1 million); (2) discountfares were allowed and used for travel charged as direct costs on Governmentfixed-price contracts and as indirect costs on all types of Governmentcontracts ($61.6 million); and (3) discount fares were established forall routes traveled by these contractors in support of Government business($47.4 million).

The General Services Administration, in coordination with Federalagencies, identified city pairs that were frequently traveled by Governmentemployees and requested the commercial airlines to propose discount airfares for Government travel over those routes. The airlines' proposalswere evaluated by the General Services Administration based on elapsedflight time, fares and frequency of service. The General Services Administrationawarded contracts to airlines that offered the most economical fares andfrequent service for the city pairs. Normally, one airline was awardeda sp<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>cific city pair. However, if one airline's flightschedule did not sufficiently cover the Government's estimated travel requirementsfor a particular city pair, contracts were established with more than oneairline for the same route. By July 1981, the Federal Contract AirlineProgram included 18 commercial airlines that offered discount air faresto Government employees traveling between 160 city pairs. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The airline contracts provided discount air fares for Federal Governmentand other designated employees traveling on official business and alsoincluded provisions for contractors to use the fares when their tra<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>v<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>el was charged as direct costs on Government cost-reimbursa<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>b<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>le contracts. These contractors were authorized toobtain the discount fares for such official Government <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ravel, and the airlines could, but were not requiredto, furnish the discount fares. In October 1982, the General Services Administrationissued Bulletin A-22 that encouraged contractor use of the fares and informedall Federal departments and agencies that contractors could use contractair fares at the airlines' discretion. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In October 1984, a significant change occurred in the contract termsgoverning Government contractors' use of discount air fares.

The discountfares, however, were used only on 4,700 trips, costing about $611,000.Based on the difference between the fares that the contractors paid andthe discount air fares that existed at the time of the trips, we projectedthat DoD could have saved an estimated $26.1 million, or about 24 percentof the $107.4 million it reimbursed to the 90 contractors for air travelcosts charged as direct costs on cost-reimbursable Government contracts(Appendix D).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Reasons for Not Using Discount Air F<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>res._</T3>The primary reason Defense contractorswere not using the discount air fares was because they were not requiredto use the fares.

First, there was no Defense-wide policy requiring contractors'use and, secondly, there were no Defense-wide procedures explaining howcontractors could request and pay for the fares. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Defense components unilaterally had developed procedures; however,implementation of the procedures was either delayed or administrativelyrestrictive.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Army._</T3>In a June 1985 message, the Army directed its transportationand contracting personnel to immediately implement contractor use of airfares (Appendix <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>E<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>).

On the o<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>her hand, one of the Tank Automotive Command's contractingofficials familiar with the Army guidance, pointed out that the Army'simplementing procedures limited contractors' use of the fares to travelarranged through Government activities.

In effect, this local policy severely restricted contractoruse of the discount fares to those nearby contractors willing to use theGovernment travel office.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Navy.</T3>_In February 1986, the Office of the Assistant Secretaryof the Navy (Shipbuilding and Logistics) issued a memorandum to all Navysystems commands that encouraged the use of Government contract air faresby contractors (Appendix F). In part, the memorandum provided that:  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">``In view of the potential significant savings which would accrueto the Navy, Contracting Officers should advise all cost reimbursable contractors(including contractors performing under fixed price incentive contracts)of the city-pair air fare program and encourage such contractors and theircost reimbursable subcontractors to take advantage of the lower air fareswhenever possible.

Procurement officials had not received detailed implementingguidance and did not know which procedures to follow to initiate the fareprogram. Additionally, the officials stated that they were awaiting DefenseAcquisition Regulatory Council approval of a standard contract clause forfare usage, and to avert inconsistent practices, they had deferred draftingNavy instructions pending clause approval.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Notwithstanding the Navy's guarded approach to initiating contractoruse of discount fares, the one example of contractor use from our samplewas arranged by a Navy program office for all travel that one contractorcharged directly to six Navy contracts.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Air Force._</T3>Of the Defense components, Air Force actions resultedin the most use of discount air fares by contractors. From November 1984to December 1985, Air Force Systems Command arranged for five contractorsto use the fares. Currently, the Air Force plans to direct five of itsplant representative offices to initiate their respective contractors'use of the discount fares. To arrange for contractors' use of the fares,Air Force Systems Command directed its contract administration officialsto work jointly with each contractor in developing procedures that specifiedthe extent contractors were required to use the fares and actions requiredfor contractors to obtain and pay for the fares. Also, the Air Force SystemsCommand required contractors to report the extent that discount air fareswere used and the savings resulting from such use. The reports providedAir Force Systems Command with good indicators of the extent of contractorsdiscount fare use.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Defense Logistics Agency._</T3>In May 1985, the Defense Logistics Agencyforwarded the General Services Administration's Federal Property ManagementRegulation Bulletin A-87, ``Use of Government Contract Air Fares By Cost-ReimbursableContractors,'' to its Defense Contr<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>act<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> Administration Services Regions for their use inadministering contracts with contractor travel requirements (Appendix G).During our audit, we found that one contractor under the cognizance ofthe Defense Contract Administration Services Region, Los Angeles, California,had participated in the discount fare program since February 1984. Forthe 9-month period ended September 1985, savings of $288,200 resulted fromthe contractor's use of discount air fares.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Based on results of this effort, officials at the Region recommendedthat the General Services Administration airline contracted travel ratesbe required, whenever possible, for all contractors traveling in supportof their Defense contracts. On December 16, 1985, the Defense LogisticsAgency proposed to the Director, Defense Acquisition Regulatory Council,that Paragraph 31.205-46(d) of the Defense Federal Acquisition RegulationSupplement be amended by incorporating the following rule:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">``The difference in cost between first-class air accommodations andless-than-first-class air accommodations is unallowable except when less-than-first-classaccommodations are not reasonably available to meet necessary mission requirements(such as when less-than-first-class accommodations would require circuitousrouting, require travel during unreasonable hours, excessively prolongtravel, result in increased cost that would offset transportation savings,or would offer accommodations not reasonably adequate for the physicalor medical needs of the traveler).

The memorandumencouraged the components to take advantage of the contract rates and providedsuggested procedures for using the fares. Those procedures, however, didnot answer all questions that contractor and plant representative officepersonnel had on the use of discount fares. As an indicator, we visitedone contractor and plant representative office after the memorandum wasissued and we were asked questions very similar to questions from othersources before the memorandum was issued.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Actions Needed to Achieve Contractors' Use of Discount Air Fares.</T3>_Theindividual actions taken by Defense managers were positive steps in thatthey recognized the potential for savings through use of reduced air faresby Defense contractors. However, these actions had not achieved the significantsavings that are available because they did not provide adequate guidanceto implement the discount fare program.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">If DoD is to realize the optimum cost benefits available from contractors'use of discount air fares, certain DoD-wide actions are required. First,DoD needs to establish a policy that requires maximum use of discount airfares by contractors for travel charged as direct costs on Government costcontracts. Second, coordinated, Department-wide procedures must be developedto effect and maintain contractors' use of the fares. The procedures shouldprovide specific instructions on how to establish, operate, and maintaincontractors' use of the fares and must be flexible enough to be incorporatedinto each contractor's</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">existing travel system. For example, for those existing programs reviewedduring the audit, we noted at least four different methods of issuing GovernmentTransportation Requests to contractors. The methods ranged from a plantrepresentative office issuing a Government Transportation Request for eachrequested trip to a Defense transportation officer providing a contractorwith a monthly Government Transportation Request number for all travelof that period. There also were different methods used to pay for airlinetickets. One contractor was billed and paid for discount air fares in thesame manner as it did other airline billings. At another contractor site,the plant representative office funded each Government Transportation Requestand the airlines billed a nearby Government transportation office for payment.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Technical assistance may also be required to implement the fare program.During our discussions with contracting officers and administrative contractingofficers, we were asked many questions about how to arrange for the contractorsto use and pay for the fares. Also, questions were presented about whethercontractors' use actually would be cost beneficial to DoD.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">DoD has gained enough experience through the limited use of discountair fares by contractors to develop a system to inform responsible officialsin the Services and Defense agencies on methods to implement and monitorthe fare program. Those officials could then ensure that the informationwas presented in a proper and timely manner to officials in subordinateorganizations as well as to contractor personnel. In summary, officialsthat will be directly responsible for effecting contractors' use must beinformed of the actions that have to be taken to use the fares and thecost benefits of doing so.</ITAG>[S10MY8-496]{S5376}Recommenda<ITAG tagnum="71">Recommendations for Corrective Action</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">We recommend that the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Productionand Logistics:</ITAG>[S10MY8-497]{S5376}1.<ITAG tagnum="21">1.

Of the $362 million, $91.4 million was spent ontrips charged as direct costs on Government fixed-price contracts, and$163.2 million was spent on trips taken in sole support of all Governmentcontracts or programs but charged as indirect costs. The remaining $107.4million was charged as direct costs on cost-reimbursable contracts (AppendixB).

However, these trips were not eligible for the reducedfares because the discount air fare program was limited to air travel chargeableto cost-reimbursable contracts.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Reasons for Limited Contractor Eligibility._</T3>No single factor wasresponsible for limiting contractors' use of the discount air fares totrips charged directly to Government cost-reimbursable contracts. Rather,a confluence of historical factors and restrictive interpretations of enablingregulations led to the exclusion of all contractor travel from the fareprogram other than that which could be charged as direct costs on cost-reimbursablecontracts.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Airline Industry 1980._</T3>In part, the limitation on contractor participationin the fare program reflected the environment of the airline industry atthe time of the initial Government contract with the airlines in 1980.The airline industry was regulated, all air fares were fixed and airlineswere not allowed to deviate from rates prescribed by tariff regulations.Additionally, there was no benefit to the airlines in offering discountfares since both the routes and fares were protected by the regulation.In this regulated environment, the Government negotiated with the airlines.The objective of the airline contract was to provide Government employeeswith discount fares. Although contractors were included as limited participantsin the initial discount air service program, no action was taken to draftan agreement for more comprehensive Government <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>contractor <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>eligibility.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Federal Acquisition Regulation._</T3>The primary factor that limitedcontractor eligibility for fare usage was Section 51.101 of the FederalAcquisition Regulation, which identified eligible users of Government sourcesof supplies and services. Contractors' use of the fares on trips in supportof cost-reimbursable contracts was the criterion for eligibility. However,an additional qualifier for use of Government sources was presented. Accordingto the regulation, contractors performing under ``other types of negotiatedcontracts . . . of a Government cost-reimbursement nature'' are consideredeligible to use Government supply sources. The purpose of enabling contractorsto use Federal supply sources was to achieve Government cost savings throughdecreased contractor expense. The provisions in the Federal AcquisitionRegulation, expanding contractor eligibility to use Federal supply sources,therefore, recognized that some contractor expenses, incurred under otherthan cost-type contracts, were reimbursable Government expenses. However,Defense acquisition officials had not provided an official interpretationof Part 51 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation to clarify what typesof contract effort, other than cost-type contracts, were authorized useof the Federal supply sources.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Government Cost Savings.</T3>_Finally, additional rationale for notinitiating wider fare application was the belief that the Government achievedcost savings only when travel was charged as direct costs on cost-reimbursablecontracts. The General Services Administration had interpreted contractors'eligibility for the fares as applicable only to that travel which was insupport of Government cost-reimbursable contracts. Their restricted interpretationdid not recognize the existence of indirect travel costs, which are allocatedto both cost as well as fixed-price contracts. It also did not addresstravel costs charged as direct costs on negotiated fixed-price contracts.For indirect trave<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>l<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> expense and negotiated fixed-price contract travel,the Government could achieve cost savings through contractors' use of theFederal discount fare program. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Action Needed to Qualify Fixed-Price and Indirect Travel Costs forthe Government Fares.</T3>_The greatest potenti<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>al<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> savings from contractors' use of the Federal ContractAirline Program could be achieved through applying discount rates to tripscharged as direct costs on fixed-price contracts and as indirect costson all types of Government contracts. Whereas 23 percent of the contractortravel sampled in our audit was charged as direct co<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ts on cost-type contracts, 20 percent was chargedas direct costs on Government fixed-price contracts and 35 percent wascharged as indirect costs on all types of Government contracts (AppendixB). To obtain savings from all contractor Government-related travel, procurementofficials must clarify regulations enabling contractors to use the faresand establish criteria for fare eligibility.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Travel Charged as Direct Costs on Fixed-Price Contracts._</T3>We reviewedthe methods used by Government contracting officers to negotiate travelexpenses under fixed-price contracts. One contracting site used a forwardpricing rate agreement in which air travel expenses had been negotiatedat full coach fares. At other activities, air travel expenses were negotiatedbased on simila<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>r<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> fares or historical costs. For these contractors,the Government accepted in the negotiated price of fixed-price contracts,air travel costs that were higher than those available through the Governmentdiscount air fare program. In negotiating fixed-price contracts, the Governmenthas the opportunity to achieve cost savings through contractors' use ofthe discount air fare program. Government fare rates rather than historicalor coach fares could be used in negotiating travel expenses. For example,one contractor sampled during our audit had a forward pricing rate agreementin which the 1985 negotiated rate for travel <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>b<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>etween Los Angeles, CA, and Washington, DC was $920.In 1985, the Federal discount fare for the city-pair was $340. Had theFederal fare been available to the contractor, the Government could havenegotiated about a $580 reduction in contract price for each proposed transcontinentaltrip. <CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>To achieve savings for travel charged as direct costson Government fixed-price contracts, regulations must be revised and clarified.In particular, Part 51 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation must clearlyidentify contract effort under negotiated fixed-price contracts as a candidatefor Federal supply source use. Also, the General Services Administration'scontract with airlines needs revision. For negotiated fixed-price contracteffort to qualify for the discount fares, the airline agreement shouldstate that all contractor travel in sole support of Government businessis eligible for discount fare usage.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Under current guidance, there is an option for contractingo<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ff<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>icers to achieve cost savings for travel chargedas direct costs on fixed-price contracts. By establishing cost-reimbur<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>sa<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ble provisions for travel expenses in fixed-pricecontracts, contractors would be eligible for the discount fares. At onecontractor site, we found that fixed-price contract has been modified toinclude a provision for contractor participation in the Federal discountair fare program. Direct travel costs were segregated under a separatecost-reimbursable provision in the fixed-price contract.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">03Travel Charged as Indirect Costs to All Types of Government Contracts.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>_Similarly, for indirect travel expenses, the Governmentwould benefit from discount fare usage. Indirect expenses, like cost-reimbursablecontract charges, are based on actual expenses. Further, for trips chargedas indirect costs, contractors could determine readily which of the tripswere in sole support of Government contracts or programs. Any decreasein travel costs associated with use of the Government's discount air fareswould result in Government cost savings. From our sample of contractorair travel expenses, we found that about 35 percent of all contractor travelwas charged as indirect costs on all types of Government contracts (AppendixB).<CODE-213>1</CODE-213></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Government savings from use of the discount faresfor travel charged as indirect costs however, were dependent on the contractor'smix of Government-commercial business. Since travel expenses charged asindirect costs were allocated to all contracts, the Government would benefitmost when fare use is provided to contractors performing predominantlyGovernment work. Because of the cost-sharing involved in indirect expenseallocation, there was the potential for inequity in granting discount faresfor indirect travel to contr<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ac<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>tors with low volume Government business. The amountof Government cost savings was dependent on the distribution factors forallocating indirect expenses to Government and commercial contracts.

On the other hand, the ASD(Pandamp;L)questioned whether air carriers would favor widespread contractor use ofthe General Services Administration's discount air fares and provide thesame discount air fares if contractors' use was expanded. The ASD(Pandamp;L)felt that business travel is the ``bread and butter'' of the air carrierindustry and widespread application of discounts to a large segment ofits prime business market may not be palatable.

We believe there is potential for expandingthe program beyond cost-reimbursa<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>b<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>le contracts. For example, the total amount of contractors'air fares addressed in this audit as solely in support of Government contractswas $362.0 million. This represented only 1 percent of the $36.9 billionin scheduled air carriers' 1984 passenger revenue. This low percentageof business travel does not appear to represent the air carriers' ``breadand butter'' market. Also, 3 of the 15 sample contractors had been successfulin negotiating discount air fares directly with air carriers for selectedroutes. While the discounts were not as large as those received by theGeneral Services Administration, their presence indicated that air carrierswere open to discounts. W<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> recognize that expansion of the Government discountprogram is in the hands of the air carriers. However, if we do not ask,we will never realize the potentially available savings.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Notwithstanding the concerns of the Assistant Secretary of Defensefor Production and Logistic<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> and the Director of Transportation, Energy and TroopSupport in the Office of the Army Deputy Chief of Staff for Logistics,the action taken by the Defense Acquisition Regulatory Council partiallysatisfies the intent of our recommendation. On August 26, 1986, the DefenseAcquisition Regulatory Council proposed to the Federal Acquisition RegulationSecretariat policies and procedures on contractor use of Government discountair passenger transportation rates. The proposed policy stated that: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(a) If it is in the Government's interest, the contracting officershall authorize eligible contractors to use the same Government discountair </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">passenger transportation rates available to Federal Employees travelingat Govenrment expense.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) Government contractors are eligible to use these rates (if theair carrier has agreed to the arrangement) in performance of a cost-reimbursementcontract or a contract with a cost-reimbursement line item for Government-authorizedtravel, or in other contracts as agreed to by specific air carriers.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(c) Contracting officers shall structure contracts with eligible contractorsso as to allow contractors to use Government air passenger transportationrates to the maximum extent practicable in accordance with contractualprovisions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Th<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>is<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> proposed revision to the Federal Acquisition Regulationpartially satisfies the recommendation since it requires contracting officersto authorize contractors to use discount air fares on trips charged directlyto cost and other types of contracts when agreed to by specific air carriers.However, the revision does not specifically address contractors' use ofdiscount air fares on trips which are in sole support of Government contractsand charged as indirect costs. As such, we ask that the Assistant Secretaryof Defense for Production and Logistics to address how contractors willuse discount air fares on trips which are in sole support of Governmentcontracts and charged as indirect costs.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">With regard to the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Production andLogistics and Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Shipbuilding and Logistics)comments on the wording of Recommendation 1., we revised the wording sothat the recommendation now concludes with the words ``when air carriershave extended such fares to DoD contractors.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Recommendation 2._</T3>We believe the Assistant Secretary of Defensefor Production and Logistics should reconsider his nonconcurrence withthis recommendation for two reasons. First, it is not possible for theAssistant Secretary to carry out the actions that <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>h<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>e agreed to take on Recommendation 3. without firstdetermining the extent that DoD plans to increase contractors' use of discountair fares. According to the Military Traffic Management Command, beforethe General Services Administration can solicit additional fares for contractors'use, DoD must provide the General Services Administration with the volumeof contractor traffic expected over each route or city pair for which adiscount air fare will be solicited. Such volume, as it relates to contractortravel charged directly to cost and fixed-price contracts, is establishedbased on direct charges. However, to determine the volume pertinent totravel charged to indirect cost accounts, DoD must decide which contractorswill be </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">permitted to use discount air fares on government travel charged toin<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>dir<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ect cost accounts. We believe the level of governmentbusiness in each contractor's organization should weigh heavily in thedecision because that level determines the extent that the government willrealize the savings resulting from the contractors' use of the discountair fares.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The other reason that we believe the Assistant Secretary w<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ou<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ld reconsider his nonconcurrence is that we do notforesee any major difficulty in establishing the recommended crit<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>eria. <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Sales data were readily available on the amount ofGov<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>er<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>nment and commercial business at each of our 15 samplecontractors. The major effort required to establish the recommended crit<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>eria <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>would be to gather the sales data and decide whichGovernment/commercial sales ratios would be acceptable in the discountair fares program. Moreover, our audit found that it was not difficultto determine the purpose and applicability of air fare costs charged toindirect cost accounts. Further, we believe that any competitive advantage,afforded a major Defense contractor because of the discount air fares program,would be negligible. Basically, a lar<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ge<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> percentage of major Defense contractors' sales areto the Government, and air fare costs charged to an indirect cost accountare only a small fraction of total sales. If it was evident that use ofthe discount air fares would result in a sig<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ni<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ficant competitive advantage, contracting officerscould specify limitations on such use.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">We ask that the Assistant Secretary reconsider his nonconcurrencewith Recommendation 2.

The main source used to gather and consolidate potentialroutes for solicitation purposes was routes shown on Government TransportationRequests used by Government employees for air travel. Since contractorshad made only limited use of Government Transportation Requests, the routestraveled by contractors' employees were not considered.

The</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">proposed FAR coverage also allows the contracting officer to inserta similar clause in other contracts involving air travel by contractoremployees when advantageous to the Government.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In regards to your recommendation that FAR Part 51 be revised to ``authorize''contractors to use GSA discount air fares, it is important to note thatthe FAR cannot ``authorize'' contractor eligibility, rather it is the aircarrier's willingness to extend the GSA discount air fares to DoD contractors.The newly approved FAR coverage does not restrict the types of contractsfor which contractors use of the GSA discount air fare is allowed.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">According to the GSA Director for Travel and Transportation ManagementDivision, Federal Supply Service, airlines are not required to extend togovernment contractors the government discount air fare program. Only 16out of the 27 airlines participating in the government discount air fareprogram have agreed to extend this privilege to government contractorsin FY 1987. In fact, two major airlines (Delta and Eastern) which allowedthis extension in FY 1986, have withdrawn the privilege in 1987 becauseof perceived contractor abuses, that is, contractors traveling under thegovernment discount program for other than government business. The GSADirector further noted that in FY 1986 government contract<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>or<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>s were authorized discounts on 700 (68.0%) of the1030 city pairs routes available to government travelers. In FY 1987, however,only 350 (24.1%) routes were available for contractors in spite of an increasein the number of routes available to government travelers from 1030 to1450. This drastic drop appears to result from air carriers concerns aboutperceived abuses by contractors and the issue of control.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The fact of the matter is that business travel is the ``bread andbutter'' of the air carrier industry. The evidence seems to indicate thatthe air carriers do not find widespread application of GSA discounts toa large segment of their prime business market palatable. If we push toohard to expand application of our discounts to a larger and larger populationof contractors travel, we are likely to see more airlines dropping outof the GAS system or we may see a rise in the rates for air travel by Governmentemployees. A discount to all is a discount to none.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Recommendation B. 2._</T3>Upon completion of Recommendation 1, requestthat the General Services Administration negotiate discount air fares forall contractor air travel solely in support of government contracts.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>ASD(Aandamp;L) Response._Concur._</T3>In conjunction with recommendationC2 the Military Traffic Management Command will request GSA to negotiatewith participating airlines to expand the terms of the discount air farecontracts to inclu<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>de<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> contractors air trav<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>el<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> in support of government contracts.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Recommendation B. 3.</T3>_Pending revision of Part 51 of the FederalAcquisition Regulation, require contracting officers to negotiate air travelexpenses in fixed-price contracts under a separate cost-reimbursable provisionin which contractors are enabled to use government discount fares and arerequired to contain air travel expenses to cost equivalent to or less thanthe government fares, whenever practical.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>ASD(Aandamp;L) Response._Concur</T3>._The proposed USD(A) memorandumto the Military Departments and Defense agencies will recommend that contractingofficers give consideration to negotiating air travel requirements in fixed-pricecontracts under a separate cost-reimbursable provision, where such a practiceis determined to be in the best interest of the government.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Recommendation B. 4<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>.<CODE-213>0</CODE-213></T3>_Establish criteria, based on level of governmentbusiness, for contractor use of the government discount air fares for travecharged as indirect costs to all types of government contracts.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>ASD(Aandamp;L) Response._Nonconcur</T3>._We do not believe that establishingthe detailed procedures that would be required, along with the burdensomeadministrative requirements to properly administer this recommendation,would be economically feasible.

Our prototype was Aerospace Corporation, Los Angeles,CA. The first 30-day cost avoidance was $192,329. Since that time, we haveexpanded the program to include seven other defense contractors. We haveachieved cost-avoidance of over $8.6 million through September 30, 1986.In addition, we have identified other defense contractor locations andare currently in the <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>taffing process to bring these on line. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Air Force <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>h<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>as reviewed the subject report and concurs with allthe findings and recommendations except<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> recommendation<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> A.3 in which you have recommended that contractingofficers negotiate air travel expenses in fixed-price contracts under aseparate cost-reimburs<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ble provision until the Federal Acquisition Regulation(FAR) is changed allowing contractors to use GSA discount fares on alltypes of contracts. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As you are aware, cost-reimburs<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ble contracts are the least desirable contract type,not only from a standpoint of increased Government risk, but also becauseof the large administrative burden associated with cost-reimburs<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ble contracts. Inclusion of a cost-reimburs<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ble provision in a fixed price contract essentiallytransforms the contract into a cost-reimburs<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ble type contract for administrative purposes andcomplicates the contracting process. In addition, there would be littleincentive for a contractor to control their travel expenses under a cost-reimbursablearrangement, and programs would be vulnerable to cost growth in those caseswhere a contractor's actual travel costs exceeded the cost estimate.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Overall, we believe the disadvantages of including a cost-reimburs<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ble provision in all fixed price contracts outweighthe advantages, and therefore do not agree with this specific recommendation.There may be circumstances when it is appropriate to include a cost-reimbursableprovision for travel expenses in a fixed price contract, but normally thiswould be an exception. Since the required change to the FAR to allow theuse of GSA discount fares on all types of contracts is relatively minor,we suggest that the change be given top priority in the Defense AcquisitionRegulation council to allow speedy implementation. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">With regards to Recommendation C.1, Air Force Systems Command willbe tasked to identify the most frequently traveled air routes used by theirmajor contractors, and in turn, furnish this information to the Commander,Military Traffic Management Command.

Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of myself and<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>S<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>enators <T4>Hatch, Pell, Pressler, Moynihan, Daschle, Stevens, </T4>and <T4>Murko<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>w<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ski.</T4>This amendment would correct a Defense Department policy which is seriouslyflawed, a policy which puts the Department of Defense in a somewhat schizophrenicposition_schizophrenic because, on the one hand, the department has acknowledgedthat it is not meeting a real need, and, on the other hand, apparentlycontinues to refuse to do so.At present, when a military family moves onto a base and then their childrenare required to attend a local school district, there is clearly an impactupon the local school district. Many in this Chamber are familiar withwhat has been termed impact aid. The fact is that impact aid has not metthe needs of many school districts as they seek to accommodate the additionalstudent load generated by families which have a military connection. Asa result, there is a growing backlog of communities in which schools areseeking assistance. They are compelled to confront the problem, and yettheir financial ability does not limit them to do so properly. We haveliterally had the situation where certain children of military personnelhave actually been found undergoing their schooling in cardboard shacks.At present, when military family housing contracts are awarded, DOD doesnot assist school districts in offsetting costs associated with educatingthe re<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ultant influx of federally connected children. Yet,the affected school districts are required to provide educational facilitiesand services to these children.This amendment seeks to address simply the subject of construction of shelter_shelterneeded so that the children of military personnel, like any other children,can literally have a decent roof over their heads in what we call a school.Otherwise, clearly, their learning would be impaired, as it would be withany other child.Because the Department of Defense has not been contributing to these costs,the result has been overcrowded classrooms, literally educational facilitiesmade of cardboard in certain communities.Mr. President, I am sure that the majority of my colleagues would agreethat this is neither an acceptable situation nor one that we, as civilizedpeople, can tolerate. How do we address that problem? We sought to addressit with impact aid; and, as I have stated, the result is a growing backlogof communities waiting on a list, hoping that they will one day be ableto participate in the very limited amount of funds available for schoolconstruction.As a result of this situation, a joint study was requested of the Departmentof Defense and the Department of Education, as a first step toward developinga solution to t<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>h<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>is problem. Last November, the final draft of thisstudy, this joint DOD-Department of Education study, known as the DoleReport_it having been requested by the senior Senator from Kansas_was finallyreleased.The report recognized the responsibility of the Department of Defense toassist in the education of military dependents. Mark this, Mr. President,because this is the Department of Defense together with the Departmentof Education speaking. This is a quotation from their rep<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>or<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>t: [S10MY8-651]{S5389}<ITAG tagnum="21">The Department of Defense and the Education Department recognize theneed to address the school facility requirements identified in the study.Failure to correct these deficiencies may deprive military dependent schoolchildrenof suitable educational facilities equivalent to those provided in thecivilian community and may have a detrimental effect on the Departmentof Defense mission and will only lead to greater costs in the future. </ITAG>Mr. President, that was indeed prophetic. It is right on the mark. Unhappily,it is having a detrimental effect on the DOD mission, and quite understandably.Military personnel who are parents, whose children are inadequately house<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>d<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> as they are attempting to learn, are not learningas well as they ought to. We all spend a great deal of time every year, and quite properly, on thedefense authorization bill. We do so because we are concerned that theNation's security, and therefore the credibility of its foreign policy,be what it should be. We will spend some $300 billion_or at least authorizethat much_in round figures, in this authorization bill. Is it asking toomuch that we take from a portion of that, that budget which is allocatedfor military construction, a tiny fraction, and use that to at least keeppace with the needs, so that we do not have this growing backlog that hasresulted from the inadequacy of the impact aid program? The answer, obviously,is, ``No.''  We surely are in no position to say we cannot afford to do that. Let me make clear, Mr. President, what is at stake. Military dependentsdeserve high quality education. They deserve the same education and thesame educational environment as children of civilians in the same communitiesin which their mili<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ary parents serve and indeed their parents do andshould demand. But actions speak a good deal louder than words and the funding mechanismin the Dole report as a revenue source to address this educational facilityshortage is simply inadequate, and the report makes that quite clear. The funding mechanism chosen was the school construction program underthe Department of Education, and it does not take a genius to discoverthat there is a waiting list of 120 schools for school construction funding.Well, at a rate of three to four funding approvals annually, we have addressedthe construction needs of all schools presently on the list by the year2028, which is a bit academic for some of the children who we would hopeto provide with that roof over their heads. Mr. President, today we can take action to ensure that there will be no121 or 122 or 123 schools added to the Education Department's waiting list.We can offer that hope and in fact we can make that hope a reality. <CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>It is unfortunate, to say the least, that the backlogexists and it needs to be addressed.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>What we are attempting with this amendment is tosee that the backlog does not increase, that instead by taking new action,by taking a fraction, a very small fraction, nine ten-thousandths to beexact, we are in a position to use the military budget for military constructionto go forward and keep pace with school construction needs that are occasionedby the student load generated by military families on bases in America'scommunities.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Essentially, the amendment before us would just requirethat the Secretary of Defense make a payment to those school districtsthat are impacted by the acquisition of family housing projects on or afterOctober 1, 1988. Payments to school districts would be determined by multiplyingthe total amount of square footages of these on-base housing units by arate of $1.50, $1.50 per square foot. That is pretty modest. It is similarto what a number of civilian school districts are charging developers inmy home State of California in order to keep pace with growing studentloads and the new school construction needs that are generated.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Additionally the schools would be required to meetbasic eligibility requirements for funding and the moneys received underthe amendment could be used for only construction of school facilities.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Acquisition of family housing would include the construction,the leasing, addition, extension, expansion, alteration, or relocationof family housing.

Mr. President, I would like to express my strong supportfor Senator <T4>Wilson's </T4>amendment to the Department of Defense reauthorizationbill.Under this amendment, all new military housing projects would be assesseda construction fee of $1.50 per square foot. The money generated from thisfee would be used to assist school districts which experience an increasein student enrollment as a result of a military construction project. Thisamendment would address a serious problem facing many school districtswhich educate military dependents.The Federal ownership of property reduces local tax revenue for schoolpurposes and Federal activities cause an influx of persons into these communities,resulting in an increased number of children to be educated. Such problemsexist at Ellsworth Air Force Base which is located near Rapid City, SD.Since the arrival of the B-1B bomber at Ellsworth, the number of authorizedpersonnel has increased by more than 600. Over the past 4 years, DouglasSchool System has experienced a 21-percent increase in student enrollment.Currently, approximately 770 students are located in makeshift classroomssuch as a supply room and a remote renovated missile site. An additional500 military personnel are expected at Ellsworth upon completion of thestrategic training center [STC] and the strategic warfare center [SWC]in the next few years. This school system's already is bursting at theseams and currently is being forced to use abandoned Nike missile sitesfor classrooms. Additional students will add to this system<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>'s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> urgent need for adequate teaching facilities.Under normal procedure, Douglas School District could apply for schoolconstruction funds under Public Law 81-815. However, the School ConstructionProgram is authorized to receive only $25 million in fiscal year 1989.Currently, the Department of Education has over 120 applicants awaitingfunds for school construction. Considering the enormous cost of buildingnew schools, very few applicants receive school construction funds in anygiven year. Thus, it could be years before Douglas School System wouldreach the top of this long waiting list. In the meantime, this districtmust continue using makeshift classrooms, such as the abandoned Nike missilesites, and look for alternative classrooms.I always have maintained that the education of our youth must be a topgovernment priority. Funding for education is a wise investment in ourfuture. It affects our productivity, our economic competitiveness, andour national security. Unfortunately, due to Federal activity, many childrenare forced to study in inadequate teaching facilities_whether in a closetconverted into a classroom, or in a building that is so rundown it shouldbe condemned. It believe it is extremely unfair to penalize these federallyimpacted school districts. The time has come for the Federal Governmentto fulfill its obligation to pay its property taxes.I am committed to working hard to ensure that every federally connectedchild is educated in a proper teaching facility. School districts facenumerous problems in educating federally connected children. This amendmentis the first step in guaranteeing that all children in impacted schooldistricts are educated in adequate teaching facilities.I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this important amendment and urge itsadoption.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213>[S10MY8-653]<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>{S5390}<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>WILSON<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Mr. WILSON.

There is about $5 millioninvolved here that would come out of the Department of Defense money foreducational purposes. But that is not the significant concern here.The problem with the Senator's amendment is that that amendment favorsschool districts which will have construction, as the bill says, ``afterOctober 1, 1988.''

And all these old districts, 105 of them in everyState of the 50 States of the Union and all of these Indian school districtsaround America in all the States that have Indian school districts, arewaiting for their money and we are going to start a new program for thenew folks on the block and put them ahead of the line of all these peoplewho have waited for 10 years.That is why I think the amendment should not be adopted and, with the highestpersonal regard for the Senator whom I retain as a friend of the fineststanding, I must reluctantly say that we are prepared to file a motionto table, and I will make that motion as soon as the Senator has concludedhis remarks.[S10MY8-658]{S5392}WILSONMr. WILSON. Will the Senator yield?[S10MY8-659]{S5392}DIXONMr. DIXON. Yes.[S10MY8-660]{S5392}WILSONMr. WILSON. Is the Senator aware, as he rattled off that list of Statesrepresenting the schools on that list, that those schools are representedby an association called the National Association of Federally ImpactedSchools?[S10MY8-661]{S5392}DIXONMr. DIXON. I am sorry. I apologize to my dear friend from California.[S10MY8-662]{S5392}WILSONMr. WILSON. The question was, is my friend from Illinois aware, as he rattledoff that list of schools in those different States, that they were representedby the National Association of Federally Impacted Schools?[S10MY8-663]{S5392}DIXONMr. DIXON. Well, I do not know whether they are represented in such a fashionor not. I only know they are school districts. <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>I<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> have the l<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>is<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>t here. I could tell you the number of the schooldistricts and everything, and the amount of money they are<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>waiting for.[S10MY8-664]{S5392}WILSONMr. WILSON. Well, that will be my next question. After telling you thatthey are represented by that National Association of Federally ImpactedSchools__[S10MY8-665]{S5392}DIXONMr. DIXON. I will take your word for it.[S10MY8-666]{S5392}WILSONMr. WILSON. Well, take my word for this as well. The director of the NationalAssociation of Federally Impacted Schools, speaking for the associationand its member schools, has endorsed this legislation. And the reason isvery simple. it is because he recognizes full well there is no need orreason to penalize anyone else because the existing program under the Departmentof Education, which DOD thinks so much of, is grossly inadequate.What they are saying is that while we work to develop solutions to theadmitted pr<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>o<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>blems of the backlog, it makes no sense to allowthe backlog to grow worse, to let that list grow longer. That is why theNational Association of Federally Impacted Schools is in favor of thislegislation.[S10MY8-667]{S5392}DIXONMr. DIXON. My friend is putting his schools at the front of that list.I do not have any objection to my friend putting his schools at the bottomof the list.The only problem I have is my friend put his schools ahead of 105 schoolsthat have been waiting for years, and 75 of the schools have been waitingfor decades.[S10MY8-668]{S5392}WILSONMr. WILSON. May I remind my friend there are more California schools onit than for any other State which is on that backlog list.[S10MY8-669]{S5392}DIXONMr. DIXON. I bet my friend will be able to explain it.[S10MY8-670]{S5392}WILSONMr. WILSON. Let me ask my friend this question: Can you tell me how manyof the schools on that list would be beneficiaries of this program? Inother words, they are in the situation of having an existing problem, butalso in the situation that they are adding new housing, new military families,and, therefore, would be immediate recipients of at least some assistanceunder the proposal? Can my friend tell me?[S10MY8-671]{S5392}DIXONMr. DIXON. Well, I can only tell my friend this: That this is the listof schools that are waiting. There are quite a few California schools onthe list, and my friend, the distinguished Senator from California, knowsthere are more people in California.[S10MY8-672]{S5392}WILSONMr. WILSON. I tell my friend from Illinois, the point I was making is ifanyone should be protecting a backlog school, it is I, because there aremore California schools on that list. But we are not going to do anythingfor them by taking no action. And I will not even ask my friend this question.It is a rhetorical question. I do not wish to be unfair to him. I willsimply state the point.Rather than asking you what would your motion to table do for those peopleon that list, that backlog list, I will simply tell my friend: It willdo nothing. We will continue to do nothing. The Department of Defense,having admitted in the Dole report that it has a responsibility, will continueto, with the other head, say: However, we are going to let the Departmentof Education do it. And the Department of Education will continue to beunable to do it, to meet that need.So, what I would have to say to my friend is that what he is proposingis that there be no solution to this problem. He is bemoaning a backlog.He is saying that there are schools on a list that will not be taken careof by this proposal.Well, I will only tell him that that list is going to rapidly grow to alength that will be an even greater national disgrace and we will havedone nothing about it.What we ought to do is both pass this amendment, which will allow us tostop the list where it is now, and keep pace with the need, and also bysome separate proposal, address that backlog.But I will tell the Senator from Illinois that that list is so old_andit is growing longer_so that the people who were first on it cannot benefitnow from so-called impact aid. They are not there any longer. They havegone.Mr. President, I will just say there is no reason to adopt a course ofaction that is no course of action. Rather, we should adopt this amendment.What we are being counseled to do is nothing. In the interest of fairness.The people who are the members of the National Association of FederallyImpacted Schools, the people who are on that list rattled off by my friendfrom Illinois, support this amendment because they recognize that tablingit will not in any way benefit them. It will simply aggravate their badsituation.Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. <T4>Exon</T4>). Is there a sufficient second? There is a sufficient second.The yeas and nays were ordered.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.[S10MY8-673]{S5392}STEVENSMr. STEVENS. I have discussed this matter with both the Senator from Californiaand the manager of the bill. A $5 million bill ought not to even requirea rollcall vote as far as this circumstance is concerned. Every one ofthese children has been moved because of orders that the Federal Departmentof Defense has given to the parent involved. It is not the same thing.I represent some of the areas that have Indian schools on that backloglist that has been mentioned. These children are moved because their parents,at least one of them, has an order from the Department of Defense to moveinto an area where the schools are inadequate. At a cost of $5 million_Ilooked into it_I am told this primarily is temporary facilities, leasingof facilities to provide schools now for the kids that are moved becausetheir parents get orders under the Department of Defense.I will tell you very frankly this is what causes the add-on problems weget on the Department of Defense appropriations bill. Because if it isnot au<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>horized, we will take care of it anyway. It oughtto be authorized. This is the kind of thing that comes up every year andwe have to face an appropriations process because the appropriators areunwilling to listen to this kind of a problem and not solve it.This is a chance for the authorization committee to solve it and I intendto support the Senator from California.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.[S10MY8-674]{S5393}GRAMMMr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I will try to be brief. After listening to thisdiscussion, I can see why there was such an outpouring of support to makeclosing bases easy. It must be a terrible tragedy to be a community inAmerica and have a military base in your midst. All those costs that areimposed on you. I can see why, when we try to set up a commission to shutdown military bases, that have not been used since the War of 1812, thatthere was such a great outpouring_because these communities are literallybeing robbed by having to provide public service<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>.Well, you all know that that is an insane concept. We all fight to thedeath around here to get military bases and to keep them when we do getthem. And we do that because they are absolute gold mines, especially forthose of us who are in States where people believe in a strong defenseand are proud to provide for that common defense.Now, Mr. President, let me define the issue very clearly here. The issuehere is simply this: Do we want to start a new concept, a user fee on militaryhousing, to pay for public schools? That is the issue.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>First of all, we have a great dearth of militaryhousing. I do not know of a military base in America where we do not havea problem with either the quality or the quantity of our military housing.Should we be coming in and taking on a new burden to pay for the localschools at the expense of military housing? I say no.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Second, we have impact aid to compensate the localcommunity for the cost of providing educational services that the distinguishedSenator from California talks about. Well, when you have a military base,people go out and buy clothes, they buy food, they buy services. But somehowthat is not supposed to convert into the local tax base? Well, Mr. President,I reject that. It does convert into the local tax base.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>What we are being asked to do here is for the Federaltaxpayer to come in and pick up another cost and another service for anothercommunity that is already a big beneficiary of the Federal taxpayers' outlay.This is another verse in an old song that started back at the beginningof the Republic when people at the frontier said: Bring those soldier boysout here. Build that fort. Defend us from the Indians. We would love tohave them out here and we will treat them real good when we get them here.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>And then the soldier boys in blue came out, builtthe fort and then the community immediately spent the rest of their existencetrying to cheat them; trying to rip them off; trying to get more moneyout of the Federal taxpayers.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Mr. President, I am deeply concerned about education.I am deeply concerned about schools. But this proposal is like going out,buying a hamburger_and we are doing that_with impact aid. Then suddenlyyou come back and say: Now, the hamburger is 75 cents. But now you knowthe meat, that is another 30 cents. You want pickles on that? That is another10 cents. We are paying for the same thing twice.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>If we want to eliminate aid and go to a school constructionprogram, maybe we ought to do it. But we ought not to add on another programthat is going to cut the quality of military housing, and not help militarypersonnel.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>We ought to ask these communities to provide theschools, and if they are not willing to provide the schools, maybe we oughtto move some of these bases to places where they will provide the schools.I assert, Mr. President, that all we have to do is mention that once andwe will have school houses built as great temples to learning all overour country.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>So I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment.This amendment has no merit and does not deserve to be accepted. I understandthere will be a motion to table. I hope my colleagues will vote for thatmotion.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Basically what weare being asked to do, I understand, with this amendment, is to leap overeverybody on the waiting list and to put certain schools up front.We promised people we would vote around 7 o'clock. I would say if thisamendment is tabled, that this will be the last vote this evening, andwe will start back tomorrow morning on SDI.

On April 14, the enormously populargeneral, returning to Washington following a 14-year absence, addresseda joint meeting of Congress.In this super-heated atmosphere, the Senate Committees on Armed Servicesand Foreign Relations announced hearings into the events that led to MacArthur'souster. Under the leadership of Armed Services Chairman Richard Russell,the majority of both committees established ground rules that barred thepublic as well as other Senators from these sessions. In response, theSenate's Republican leadership urged open sessions.<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>By<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> the time the hearings began on the morning of May3, the committees had agreed to allow the 70 Senators who did not belongto either panel to attend as observers. In this status, those Senatorswere not permitted to participate in the questioning of either MacArthuror the many witnesses who followed him. However, they were allowed to submittheir questions to any committee member. That member could then decidewhether to pose the question. Although the press was barred, the jointcommittee released copies of the hearing transcript, page by page, duringthe sessions to waiting reporters outside the caucus room. This came immediatelyafter review by a Defense Department censor.The hearings lasted for 7 weeks with a witness list that included the Secretariesof State and Defense, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize one of the Nation'sforemost col<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>l<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>eges of business administration, Bryant College.Located in my own State of Rhode Island, Bryant this year celebrates its125th anniversary of providing quality business education. Bryant College makes its home in Smithfield. Its enrollment consists of3,000 undergraduate day students, 2,000 undergraduate evening students,and 1,400 graduate school students. In all, more than 6,000 of some ofour Nation's brightest students flock to Bryant's strikingly contemporarycampus. There they receive the academic preparation needed to become thebusiness leaders of tomorrow. Bryant also helps established business people by empowering them with theskills necessary to cope with an everchanging global economy. The collegeis a leading center for executive education and a major resource for theNew England business community. Its center for management development providesseminars and workshops on diverse management topics to 6,000 business executivesannually. The Rhode Island Small Business Development Center [SBDC], administeredand partially funded by Bryant through a partnership with the Federal SmallBusiness Administration, offers free consulting and seminars to more than1,000 small business operators each year. Bryant was the first private college in the Nation to establish an SBDCin its State. Bryant recognized the importance of small business, whichtoday accounts for 97 percent of all new businesses and annually createsover 80 percent of all net new jobs. The Rhode Island SBDC was one of thefirst nine certified in the United States. One can only fully appreciate Bryant's 125 years of providing excellencein education by looking back at its distinguished past. In 1863, as theCivil War raged, the Providence, RI, franchise of the Bryant andamp; StrattonNational Commercial College was founded. This institution pioneered educationin the United States and the Providence was an instant success. Veteransreturning from the Civil War used their mustering-out pay to study bookkeeping,commercial calculation, correspondence, and practical business disciplines.In 1866, the college moved to larger downtown headquarters. At about thesame time, the Bryant and Stratton chain pulled apart and the college becameautonomous. Later, it was sold to William W. Warner who changed the school'sname to Warner's Polytechnic <ITAG tagnum="80">Business College. One of Warner's faculty members purchased the collegefrom him in 1878 and resumed use of the Bryant and Stratton name.</ITAG>The college continued to prosper and in 1915 merged with the R.I. CommercialSchool. In 1935 the school moved to Providence's fashionable East Sideand was renamed Bryant College. After World War II Bryant again experiencedanother postwar boom as its reputation spread beyond Rhode Island. By thelate 1960's, Bryant had outgrown its Providence campus. The remedy forBryant's growing pains was provided by Tupperware executive Earl S. Tupper.Impressed with the school's long time ``campus-to-careers'' educationalapproach, Tupper donated his 220-acre estate on Memory Ridge in Smithfieldto the college.Today the school is engaged in an ambitious strategic planning processto enhance its academic programs and quality of student life. It is trulyan educational innovator. Strategic planning at Bryant was initiated byPresident William T. O'Hara, a former counsel to the U.S. House of Representatives<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>P<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ostsecondary <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>E<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ducation <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>S<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ubcommittee. Included among O'Hara's publicationsare ``The Student/The College/The Law'' and ``John F. Kennedy on Education.''Strategic planning called for bold new initiatives including developmentof further partnerships with the business community, creation of an internationalstudies component, expansion of internship opportunities, specific trainingin leadership, and an instructional development center for faculty. Butthe school has not stopped there. Bryant has continued to expand, addingnew residence halls and a new student union, and converting the old studentcenter into a computer technology center.The Labor Department recently released a report showing that in the year2000 most jobs will require at least a college degree. This report alsoconcludes that most persons will make three or four career changes in theirlifetime. Against this background, institutions like Bryant College thatprovide quality education needed for such an economy are presented withan immense opportunity to thrive as educational leaders in the 21st century.On its 125th anniversary, I join with all Rhode Islanders in congratulatingBryant College and in sending my best wishes to its administrators, faculty,staff, students, and alumni for great success in the years ahead.[S10MY8-710]{S5395}F<ITAG tagnum="66">F</ITAG>[S10MY8-711]{S5395}MILITARY S<ITAG tagnum="81">MILITARY SECURITY IN EUROPE</ITAG>[S10MY8-712]{S5395}WIRTHMr. WIRTH. Mr. President, in laying out his views on the INF Treaty andthe prospects for future conventional arms control efforts with the Soviets,Ambassador Jonathan Dean declares that the Warsaw Pact's quantitative advantagein major weapons and troop divisions does not necessarily translate intosuperiority in actual combat. According to Dean, the postwar era has seenthe Soviets squander important political assets in Western Europe as EasternEuropean armed forces have continued to be of questionable strategic valuegiven their uncertain loyalties. Moreover, NATO air forces are widely regardedas qualitatively superior and better trained than their Warsaw Pact counterparts.NATO's defense expenditures have exceeded those of the Warsaw Pact andconvey the fact that NATO has made useful improvements in its forces. Forits part, the Soviet Union lacks the combat-ready divisions needed to successfullylaunch the minimum preparation attack NATO most fears, and, perhaps moresignificantly, the second echelon of Soviet troops in the western U.S.S.R.capable of reinforcing such an attack within 2 weeks are not nearly asnumerous as is commonly thought.Following is a summary of Ambassador Dean's recent article in Foreign Affairs,and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the <T4>Record.</T4>There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in the<T4>Record, </T4>as follows:[S10MY8-713]{S5395}Summary<ITAG tagnum="74">Summary</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Given the clear numerical superiority of the Warsaw Pact over NATOin most classes of major conventional armaments, including heavy tanks,self-propelled artillery, attack helicopters and interceptor aircraft,the question is this: Would elimination of American INF weapons increasethe possibility of a sudden Soviet attack or a more effective Soviet politicalintimidation of Western Europe? These possibilities clearly exist. Butthey require a closer look. The real question is whether the Warsaw Pact'ssuperiority in numbers of weapons and troop divisions converts to superiorityin actual combat.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Whatever the chances were, in NATO's formative period in the early1950s, of a Soviet attack on Western Europe, the passage of time has deprivedthe Soviet Union of some important potential assets. Moscow can no longercount on the willing assistance of West European communist parties. Strongand loyal in the 1950<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> these parties are now much weakened_and, as in thecase of the Italian Communist Party, disaffected from Moscow. And uncertainloyalties of the armed forces of the Eastern European states have convertedthem from a meager advantage into a probable hindrance in most potentialsituations of East-West conflict.   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The West's main concern remains the possibility of surprise attackby Soviet forces_or, more precisely, of attack with minimum preparation.Yet Soviet capacity for such an attack may not be as great as feared. NATO'sexpenditures on defense have exceeded those of the Warsaw Pact for morethan two decades. While not all these funds have been spent in an optimalway, they have not been wasted, and NATO has made many useful improvementsin its forces. In the region from the Atlantic to the Urals, active-dutypersonnel of NATO ground and air forces are just as numerous as those ofthe Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact. Exercise after exercise has demonstratedthat the Warsaw Pact<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>air forces are incapable of gaining control of NATOairspace against qualitatively superior NATO air forces; this would beessential for successful attack.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The contingency which continues to cause the greatest concern to NATOleaders is that the Soviets, in the hope of securing their objectives beforethe United <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>S<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>tates could become fully involved in conventionalbattle or decide to use nuclear weapons, would launch a minimum-preparationattack against NATO's central front in Germany. The Soviet Union has increasedthe firepower and mobility of its gro<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>u<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>nd forces in the l<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>st two decades. But at least half of the Pact's numericalsuperiority in units and major armaments is in reserve divisions whichtake a month of more to ready for combat. There are too few combat-readySoviet divisions to permit the U.S.S.R. to launch, with any confidence,the feared minimum-preparation attack.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Only 30 combat-ready <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>S<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>oviet divisions in Eastern Europe are positionedfor such an attack; probably a third of these would have other essentialmissions during the initial phases of a minimum-preparation attack againstNATO's vital central front. Even if augmented by over half of the EastGerman, Polish and Czechoslovak first-category forces (of uncertain qualityand loyalty), the resulting force of some thirty-odd divisions would beno larger in divisional manpower than the U.S., U.K. and Western Germanground forces <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>i<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>n the area.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Soviet second echelon in the western U.S.S.R. capable of reinforcinga minimum-preparation attack <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>w<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ithin the first two weeks is also surprisingly small_fewerthan ten ground force divisions. Soviet tanks in active-duty forces incentral Europe number only about 8,000, not many more than those of active-dutyNATO forces, which would moreover have the advantage of defensive positions.The recent landing of a small West German private plan<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> in Red <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>S<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>quare, flying unscathed through dense Soviet airdefenses, once again r<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ises well-documented doubts about the quality ofSoviet forces, less well trained and led than those of the <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>W<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>est German Bundeswehr and of U.S. and U.K. forcesin Europe. The chances of success of a sudden attack would be slight. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Other contingencies, such as that of a slow, full mobilization ofEast and <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>W<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>est, are possible. But the outcome of these is alsouncertain, in part because the dimensions of the resulting conflict, includingthe participation of ten or more additional U.S. divisions, would ensurethat the engagement would be worldwide in scope and make it all the morelikely that it would escalate to nuclear war.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the National ParkService Review Board Act. This legislation elevates the Park Service missionand gives the Park Service the autonomy and independence necessary to protectAmerica's national heritage.This Nation's vast land and variety of natural resources have been criticalfactors in our history and have shaped our development. The Old World wasa place of kings and castles and beggars. The New World has been a placeof abundance. In their crowded cities, the Europeans dreamed of a landof great riches and eternal youth. They sought the Fountain of Youth. Theysought El Dorado. And they found these places, here, in America.Our lands are themselves a clear window to the past. Geologists talk of``deep time.'' When you go from the Grand Canyon to Zion and Bryce CanyonNational Parks, you proceed up the stairsteps of hundreds of millions ofyears_recorded in the layers of earth as if some ancient force wanted usto know its story and to remind us how, against that backdrop, the eveningnews, the musings of pundits, and even our lives seem but the tiniest fractionof a second. Indeed, all of human history is represented on the canyonwall as just one narrow slice of rock.A few years ago, I visited Mesa Verde and Chaco Canyon and discovered themystery of the Anazazi culture. Standing in the kiva of Casa Bonito lateone spring afternoon, I tried to imagine the full impact of the ancientapartment houses and magnificent roads that lay before me. I could hearthe noise and shouts. I could smell the smoke. I could see the people.I could sense the panic and abandonment that relentless drought would bring.The land is our teacher. It teaches us the value of things that can't bebought or sold, traded or exchanged. What's the dollar value of the desert?What price tag would you put on the endless grasses of the Everglades?In an earlier time, we might have said: zero. Nothing. They're worthless.Today, we look at the lonely beauty of the desert or the cypress swampand say: it's priceless.Our national parks are unique. They grew from an enlightened vision whichacknowledged the land's importance to all of us. We've set aside vast amountsof land, from<ITAG tagnum="80">seashores to mountain tops. We celebrate particular places interwovenwith our history: the battlefield at Gettysburg, the Statue of Liberty,Ford's Theater. And we entrust these lands, these pieces of heritage, tothe National Park Service to protect and foster.</ITAG>This job is a critical one. Every year, the concrete creeps closer. Thesubdivisions move nearer. Pesticides and biocides pollute the waters. Today,there's even a man-made haze over the Grand Canyon. As Roderick <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>N<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ash reminds us, ``wild land will remain wild onlyas the result of human choice. The blank spaces are being filled in. Today,not in 1890, could be the <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>real <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>closing of the American frontier.''When the national parks were created, they were created for us, for ourchildren and for our children's children. Each generation has used theparks, and each generation has used them in different ways. In the earlydays of the parks, Americans who couldn't afford a fancy tour could getthere in the family's model-T. Today, thanks to Gore-Tex, and freeze-driedfoods, many people leave their cars to hike along trails and streambeds.We don't know how our children will use the parks. But we do know thatneither we nor they will ever be able to create more wilderness. If whatis available today is lost through lack of resolve or mismanagement, itwill be lost forever.The battle to keep a standard of excellence in our parks is difficult andcomplex. More and more, the issues which shape parks grow from local toregional to national. In this procession, the decisions that are made becomeincreasingly political. This is, of course, neither unexpected nor necessarilyunwise. The successful resolution of conflicting interests almost alwaysdemands compromise. However, to weave politics and compromise into themission of the Park Service is a perilous step and a threat to this landheritage.Mr. President, the Park Service is the steward of our park lands. Theirrole should be an uncompromising one and their goal should be of simpleexcellence. Too much is at stake. If politics or compromise is to be partof the policy calculus, it should enter the equation in the full lightof day. And we should never expect or hope that the National Park Serviceadopts an agenda which is less than complete or flawed by external pressure.This legislation emphasizes a politically independent National Park Service.The bill creates a three-person Review Board. The members which will beappointed by the <ITAG tagnum="80">President to staggered 4-year terms. The Park Service Director wouldbe appointed by the President and serve for a term of 5 years. The Directorcould be renominated but could serve only two consecutive terms. </ITAG>The Review Board would report annually to the President and Congress onthe management and budget of the Park Service. The Board is to addressthe resource needs of the Park Service and make recommendations that bestserve the mission of the Park Service and the American public. During my years at the Energy Committee, I've taken a long look at thePark Service. I've also had a personal involvement in a number of parkissues, national as well as those linked specifically to New Jersey's parks.Too often, field recommendations have been reversed by higher Departmentofficials in accordance with national park policies that seem at odds withthe preservation of this fantastic resource heritage. For example, thisadministrator refuses to provide significant funding for land acquisition,historic preservation or basic construction projects within national parkunits. This policy is defended as fiscally responsible. Yet, the effectof these policies and this ``responsibility'' guarantee that precious resourceswill be lost forever. In New Jersey, historical records and artifacts havebeen destroyed or damaged du<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> to inadequate preservation. The price of acquiringland inholdings has skyrocketed. And millions of visitors to Sandy Hookbeaches must rely on bathroom facilities installed as temporary facilitiesyears ago that are a disgrace. The Review Board will not necessarily lead to more money for preservation,land acquisition, or even Sandy Hook's bathrooms. Yet, if we are to makethe proper decisions, the Congress needs a clear, untarnished statementof the Park Service's mission and needs. Such a statement is not availabletoday, and would be developed by the Park Service Review Board. This bill's purpose is very simple: to create a safeguard against heavy-handedpolitical meddling or compromise which threatens the fabric of the ParkSystem. Obviously, this bill does not remove the Park Service from thedirection of the President. The President nominates all of the membersof the Board and the Director. Also, this bill is not just an indictmentof the current administration's practices. Rather, the bill deals withissues that would be inevitably raised, regardless of the political persuasionof the occupant of the White House. Mr. President, this bill is not complicated. There's no hidden agenda.The legislation seeks to maintain the <ITAG tagnum="80">standard of excellence that has characterized the National Park Systemover its long history. The President needs to maintain a dedicated coreof Park Service employees. The Congress needs clear information and guidance.The Park Service needs consistent direction and purpose. A Park Servicemuzzled by political whim is of no use to the American public. This billis a necessary first step in response to a complex problem, and I urgemy colleagues' support.</ITAG>I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in full inthe <T4>Congressional Record</T4>.There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the <T4>Record</T4>, as follows:[S10MY8-766]{S5398}S. 2360<ITAG tagnum="74">S. <CODE-213>5</CODE-213></ITAG><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>2360<ITAG tagnum="20"/><T3> Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the UnitedStates of America in Congress assembled,</T3>[S10MY8-767]{S5398}SECTION1.<ITAG tagnum="72">SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to preserve personalprivacy with respect to the rental, purchase, or delivery of video tapesor similar audio visual materials and the use of library materials or services;to the Committee on the Judiciary.[S10MY8-769]{S5398}video and <ITAG tagnum="89">video and library privacy protection act</ITAG>[S10MY8-770]{S5398}LEAHYMr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Video and Lib<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ra<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ry Privacy Protection Act of 1988. This measure willensure that the choice of books we read and the movies we view will beprotected against unlawful disclosure. It is a timely response to the needto protect private activities in an era of increasing information collectionand dissemination.During the nomination hearing of Judge Robert Bork, a reporter obtaineda list of the video tapes Judge Bork and his family had rented at a localvideo store, and then published an article in <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Th<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>e City Pape<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>r.<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> I joined with members of the Judiciary Committeeand others in denouncing this unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.I said at the time this story broke and I repeat today that it is no one'sbusi<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ne<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ss what video tapes Judge Bork or anyone else choosesto view. Few Americans will undergo the scrutiny given a Supreme Courtnominee, but Judge Bork and all of us are entitled to a reasonable expectationof privacy.I have worked with Senator <T4>Simon</T4>, Senator <T4>Grassley,</T4> and Senator <T4>Simpson</T4> to draft a comprehensive bill that would prohibit thistype of disclosure and I believe it will be an important piece of our statutoryprotection of the right to privacy.Commentators and courts have struggled with the meaning of a ``right toprivacy.'' Some have said that it is the right of autonomy or personhood.Others have described it as the freedom from outside intrusion. JusticeBrandeis said simply that it is the ``right to be let alone.''In practical terms, our right to privacy protects the choice of moviesthat we watch with our family in our own homes. And it protects the selectionof books that we choose to read. These activities are at the core of anydefinition of personhood. They reveal our likes and dislikes, our interestsand our whims. They say a great deal about our dreams and ambitions, <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>our<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> fears and our hopes. They reflect our individuality,and they describe us as people.Who would have imagined that the video tapes that one watches at home orthe books that one reads in the evening might become matters of publicrecord? Not even George Orwell anticipated this.When people rent video tapes they might reasonably expect that their nameswill be exchanged with other video dealers as video purchasers. They mighteven expect to receive special notices about adventure films, educationalfilms, or exercise tapes, if they have joined specialized film groups.What they do not expect, and what the law should not allow, is that a detailed<ITAG tagnum="80">list of their previous rentals_the titles of the films, the datesthey were rented_will be disclosed to other, without their consent.</ITAG>Mr. President, we know that <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>he transfer and compilation of this computerizedinformation has become easier as the costs for data storage have diminished,and the sophistication of information collection has increased. We knowalso that statutory safegruards for privacy protection confront powerfulinstitutional and economic pressure. For example, the growth of computermatching between Federal agencies undercut the protections embodied inthe Privacy Act of 1974. But we in the Congress will have to confront theseissues more and more in the years ahead.David Burnham, a New York Times reporter who followed computer issues forseveral years, described this problem of transactional data in his book,The Rise of the Computer State. Our information society is generating anenormous record of personal activity. Every stop at an ATM machine, everycar rental transaction, and, now it seems, every purchase at a grocerystore places us in space and time. It provides a history of our comingsand goings. People can find out where you were, what you were doing, andpossibly who you were with. Who is to say that someday this informationcould not be compiled and elaborate dossiers on individual activi<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>y prepared?Alexander Solzhenitsy<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>n<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>, a Vermont resident, described this danger in themost vivid terms. He wrote:[S10MY8-771]{S5399}<ITAG tagnum="21">As every man goes through life he fills in a number of forms for therecord, each containing a number of questions . . . There are thus hundredsof little threads radiating from every man, millions of threads in all.If these threads were suddenly to become visible, the whole sky would looklike a spider's web, and if they materialized like rubber bands, busesand trams and even people would lose the ability to move and the wind wouldbe unable to carry torn<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>-<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>up newspapers or autumn leaves along the streetsof the city.</ITAG>The subtlety of this problem was only barely envisioned by Justice Brande<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>i<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>s when he warned us of the dangers to privacy thatnew technologies bring. In that famous dissent in the Olmstead decision,Judge Brandeis warned that:[S10MY8-772]{S5399}<ITAG tagnum="21">Subtler and more far reaching means of invading privacy have becomeavailable to the Government . . . the progress of science in fur<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>n<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ishing the Government with the means of espionageis not likely to stop with wiretapping.

Justice Brand<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>eis<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> once defined the right of privacy as, simply, ``theright to be let alone.'' And Justice Anthony Kennedy, during his nominationhearings, noted: [S10MY8-778]{S5400}<ITAG tagnum="21">We are very much in a state of evolution and debate.<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>* * * We are still in a rudimentary state of thelaw so far as the right of privacy is concerned. </ITAG>The right of privacy is not, however, a generalized undefined right; itis a specific right, one which individuals should understand.

Toward the end, I am, along with <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>S<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>enators <T4>Leahy </T4>and <T4>Simon</T4>, pleased to introduce legislation intended to prevent andredress certain intrusions into personal privacy. The Video and LibraryPrivacy <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>P<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>rotection Act of 1988 recognizes that individualsshould be protected in their personal use of <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>v<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ideotapes and library books. This bill will givespecific meaning to the right of privacy, as it affects individuals intheir daily lives.

Likewise, a librarywould be prevented from revealing the identity of its patrons and the booksthey borrow or services they use.

We do not want to preempt the Statesfrom acting in this area. In fact, the State legislatures are particularlywell suited to respond to technological changes and trends in society.Thus, under our bill, citizens in States with similar legislation willmerely have an alternative in the Federal <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>r<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>emedy.Likewise, we share a concern about imposing penalties upon those who arein the business of renting or selling videofilms and who own libraries.However, privacy, as defined in this bi<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>l<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>l, requires protection.

I know that many of my colleagues are concerned with the notice of personalprivacy and what it means for Americans. Passage of this legislation willhelp define and as a result, enhance individual privacy. [S10MY8-779]{S5401}SIMONMr. SIMON. Mr. President, today I join with my colleagues Senator <T4>Leahy, </T4>Senator <T4>Grassley, </T4>and Senator <T4>Simpson </T4>in introducing legislation to protect one of the mosttreasured liberties of all, the right to privacy. There is no denying thatthe computer age has revolutionized our world. Over the past 20 years wehave seen remarkable changes in the way each one of us goes about our lives.Our children learn through computers. We bank by machine. We watch moviesin our living rooms. These technological innovations are exciting and asa nation we should be proud of the accomplishments we have made.Yet as we continue to move ahead, we must protect time honored values thatare so central to this society, particularly our right to privacy. Theadvent of the computer means not only that we can be more efficient tha<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>n<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> ever before, but that we have the ability to bemore intrusive than ever before. Every day Americans are forced to provideto businesses and others personal information without having any controlover where that information goes. Computer records are kept on where wetravel, what we eat, what we buy, what we watch, and what we read. Theserecords are a window into our loves, likes, and dislikes. As Justice Brandeispredicted over 40 years ago in his famous dissent in the Olmstead wiretapcase:[S10MY8-780]{S5401}<ITAG tagnum="21">Time works changes, brings into existence new conditions and purposes* * * Subtler and more far reaching means of invading privacy have becomeavailable * * * Ways may some day be developed by which the Government,without removing papers from secret drawers, can reproduce them in courtand by which it will be enabled to expose to a jury the most intimate occurrencesof the home.</ITAG>This point was brought home to me during the course of the confirmationhearings on Judge Bork when I learned that a reporter had received froma local video store a list of the movies that Judge Bork and his familyhad rented. Who would guess that the choice of movies one watches in theprivacy of the home would not be confidential?The legislation being introduced today takes an important step in ensuringthat individuals will maintain control over their personal informationwhen renting or purchasing a movie or when borrowing a library book. Thebill specifically provides for a Federal cause of action in the event alist which identifies the books we read or the movies we watch is released.Since there are certain circumstances in which it may be necessary forthis information to be divulged, the bill provides for some limited exceptionsto the prohibition, including an exemption to cover legitimate law enforcementactivities.No doubt in the days and years ahead we will continue to make much progressin developing new technologies. While I am fully supportive of innovationand growth, I remain committed to protecting those principles which areso central to America.

Mr. President, I today am introducing legislationintended to strengthen conservation and management of lobsters in the UnitedStates.Maine and the rest of New England is famous for lobsters. In 1987, totalU.S. landings of lobsters weighed 45 million pounds, and were valued at$133 million. Maine, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island led the region's fishingindustry in lobster landings, followed by Connecticut and New Hampshire.What few people realize is the careful balance of scientific and technicalconsiderations which are necessary to preserve lobsters as a vital andabundant ocean resource. New England lobsters_also known as American lobsters_areof a distinct species, homarus americanus, found in waters of the northwestAtlantic, from Labrador to Cape Hatteras. Stocks are concentrated in theGulf of Maine, and waters off southern New England.Conservation and management of the lobster fishery occurs under a combinationof Federal and State law. State laws regulate in-shore catches up to 3miles from the coast. Under the Magnuson Act, Federal regulations applyto catches from 3 to 200 miles off-shore. However, Federal regulationsrequire that anyone holding a State lobster permit which is endorsed forlobstering in Federal waters must observe the more restrictive_that is,Federal_requirements for all lobsters caught.Federal regulations for the American Lobster Fishery are contained in theCode of Federal Regulations (50 CFR 649). One of the most important conservationmeasures in the management plan is a minimum legal size for a harvestedlobster's body shell length. The current minimum size is 3\7/32\ inches,but is scheduled to increase to 3\1/4\ inches in 1989; 3\9/32\ inches in1990; and 3\5/16\ inches in 1991.The Federal regulation follows minimum size increases mandated by changesin State laws during 1987 in Maine, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island. Thesechanges represent a critical effort to strengthen and enhance the conservationof American lobster stocks.New Hamsphire and Connecticut are expected to move also to match theseincreases in their State laws. However, only a small number of lobsterfishermen are not already subject to the Federal minimum size requirements.In New Hampshire, for example, which accounts for less than 3 percent ofNew England lobster land<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>in<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>gs, 76 percent of all lobsters are landed by fishermenwith federally endorsed permits.An appropriate balance exists between Federal and State laws for fisheriesconservation and management. Within the United States, the lobster managementplan is working. However, the Federal plan is threatened by imports ofAmerican lobsters which are below its minimum size.Approximately 50 percent of American lobsters sold in the United Statesare imported. In 1987, total U.S. landings of American lobsters weighed45 million pounds, and were valued at $133 million. Total imports were3<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>9<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> million pounds, valued at $178 million. Of theseimports, 10 percent are estimated to be below the Federal minimum size.As the minimum size increases, the number of imports estimated below theminimum size will increase to approximately 30 percent.In the U.S. market, where domestic and imported lobsters are intermingledin the stream of commerce, it is virtually impossible to enforce compliancewith the Federal minimum size_particularly in places outside of New England,such as Chicago or Los Angeles. There also is an open risk of a ``blackmarket'' developing in subminimum lobsters of U.S. origin.The New England lobster industry also sees itself as forced to comply withminimum size requirements which do not apply to imports. It does not makesense, from the point of view of basic fairness. Let any foreign nationobserve whatever minimum size it wants within its own waters. But withinthe United States, such a nation should respect our law and our minimumlobster size.The legislation which I am introducing today would accomplish this conservationpurpose. It would prohibit importation of lobsters which do not complywith the Federal minimum size.With respect to two other provisions of the Federal lobster managementplan, the legislation also would prohibit imports of ``berried'' or scrubbed''lobsters, which are respectively, egg-bearing lobsters, or lobsters withvisible evidence of eggs having been forcibly removed. The legislationalso would apply to both whole lobsters or lobster parts. However, themost urgent concerns for enforcement definitely are whole lobsters andthe minimum size requirement.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>This legislation is urgently necessary if the legitimacyof the Federal lobster management is to be maintained.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Unless imported lobsters sold in the United Statesare held to the same conservation standards as our own fishermen, New Englandindustry leaders fear that sentiment will grow soon to repeal the Federaland State minimum lobster sizes. This would reverse the steady progressin enhancing conservation in recent years. It also would jeopardize thelong-term future of the resource.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>I emphasize that the purpose of this legislationis conservation. It does not prohibit imports of lobsters, but rather,only those lobsters which do not meet our conservation and management standards.New England lobster dealers depend on imports to meet market demand, andI would not support any real restriction on the flow of such trade.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>There even have been recent suggestions that Canadianlobstermen_who are the<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>source of imported lobster for the United States_mayseek a Canadian minimum size to match the United States standard.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>I do not know whether such reports are correct. Suchaction would be encouraging news, and might obviate the immediate needfor legislation. However, it is impossible to assess that prospect at thistime.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>For now, urgent action is needed.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>And I intend to take all necessary action to enhancelobster conservation and management under U.S. law, and to require adherenceby imports to our Federal minimum lobster size.andCx.1; </ITAG>[S10MY8-783]{S5402}CHAFEE<ITAG tagnum="10">andCx.1; Mr. CHAF<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>E<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>E. Mr. President, I rise today in strong supportof legislation which is designed to promote the conservation of one ofthe finest delicacies in the American diet: the lobster.The United States has already taken steps to protect this resource by establishinga minimum conservation size of lobster<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> which can be taken as part of a U.S. Fisheries ManagementPlan for North America. However, while we have taken strong steps to protect young lobsters inthe reproductive stage, we are still allowing the importation of lobstersbelow the minimum size. This importation creates a strong incentive forthe creation of a ``black market'' for under-size<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>d<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> lobsters, caught in U.S. waters but marketed asimported lobsters. Importing lobsters below the minimum standard size cr<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ates a sense of unfairness. The New England Lobsterindustry is required to adhere to a standard which does not apply to imports.This has created a sentiment among U.S. lobstermen to simply do away withthe minimum size requirement altogether, an action which would have seriouslong term consequences for the industry. Mr. President, the legislation which Senator <T4>Mitchell, </T4>Senator <T4>Cohen, </T4>myself and others are introducing today will prevent theimportation of lobsters into the United States that do not meet the minimumsize requirements of the U.S. fisheries management and conservation system.The purpose of this legislation is not to unduly restrict trade, but toprovide a strong incentive for preserving a $300 million industry. RhodeIsland alone harvests over 5 million pounds of lobster per year, worthclose to $17 million. Over 800 lobstermen are employed in my State, andtheir<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>livelihood depends on the continued regenerationof a healthy lobster population. This can only occur if we take adequatesteps to prevent the taking of lobsters below the minimum size, and encouragethis sound ma<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>na<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>g<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ment practice along the North American coast.I urge my colleagues to join with us in supporting this legislation.andCx.1;</ITAG>[S10MY8-784]{S5402}COHEN<ITAG tagnum="10">andCx.1;<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> Mr. COHEN. <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleaguefrom Maine, Senator <T4>Mitchell, </T4>and other New England Senators, in sponsoring legislationto enhance the ongoing Federal effort to protect the North Atlantic lobster(homerus americanus).In 1986, the New England lobster industry and the Department of Commercetook a giant step toward the conservation of this lobster species by approvinga Lobster Fishery Management Plan <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>[<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>FMP<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>]<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> which included a gradual increase in the minimumsize of lobsters caught in North Atlantic waters. The purpose of this regulationis to allow mature lobsters to reproduce, thus leading to an increase inthe lobster population.Approval of this important conservation measure followed years of discussionand controversy over the need and effectiveness of such a measure. It wasa difficult step for the lobster industry to take, because it meant thatmany under-sized lobsters previously caught and sent to market had to betossed back in the water. However, it was a step the lobstermen were willingto take because they recognized that the depletion of the lobster specieswould result in the elimination of their livelihood. Allowing lobstersto reach maturity is a vital element in the protection of this importantspecies.I want all of my colleagues to think long and hard of what life would belike without lobster. A truly enjoyable experience_the lobster dinner_<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>w<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ould become a thing of the past, and the world wouldbe a darker place because of it.While New England fishermen have found no diffic<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>u<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>lty with the new minimum size regulations, a problemhas arisen because Canada does not have similar minimum size regulationseven though Canadian lobsters account for roughly 50 percent of the U.S.market. As long as Canada continues to catch and market undersize<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>lobsters in the United States, the effectivenessof U.S. conservation measures is reduced, and the lobster population inthe North Atlantic will continue to decline.The legislation we are proposing today would prohibit the importation ofNorth Atlantic lobsters that do not meet the U.S. standard for minimumsize. I hope that this measure will be approved by the Senate, so thatlobstermen along the east coast will not see their attempts at conservationcircumvented. I fear that if we do not implement this import prohibition,the New England industry will give up and repeal its own conservation measures.What will follow is the decline of a species very important to Maine lobstermenand to the Nation as a whole.I urge the Senate to expedite passage of this bill.andCx.1;<ITAG tagnum="63"/><ITAG tagnum="18">By Mr.<T4> DeConcini</T4> (for himself, Mr.<T4> Pell, </T4>Mr.<T4> Moynihan, </T4>Mr.<T4> Stevens, </T4>Mr.<T4> Hatfield, </T4>Mr.<T4> Conrad, </T4>Mr.<T4> Grassley, </T4>Mr.<T4> Mitchell, </T4>Mr.<T4> McCain, </T4>Mr.<T4> Cochran, </T4>Mr.<T4> Sarbanes, </T4>Mr.<T4> Burdick, </T4>Mr.<T4> Gramm, </T4>Mr.<T4> Durenberger, </T4>Mr.<T4> Melcher, </T4>Mr.<T4> Matsunaga, </T4>Mr.<T4> Reid, </T4>Mr.<T4> Stennis, </T4>Mr.<T4> Dodd, </T4>Mr.<T4> Chiles, </T4>Mr.<T4> Packwood, </T4>Mr.<T4> Lugar, </T4>Mr.<T4> Inouye, </T4>Mr.<T4> Simon, </T4>Mr.<T4> Hatch, </T4>Mr.<T4> Pro<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>x<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>mire,</T4> and Mr.<T4> W<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>irth<CODE-213>0</CODE-213></T4>):</ITAG>S.J.

This resolution calls upon the President to issue a proclamationencouraging parents, educators, librarians, government officials, corporations,and associations to observe the year with programs and activities to sparka reading habit in our young people. I think we can all agree that developingour children and young adults into readers today is the best way to ensurea literate and informed society tomorrow.One of the themes for the year will be ``Give Us Books, Give Us Wings''from Paul Hazard's ``Books, Children, and Men.'' Like the Year of the Readercampaign in 1987, the 1989 campaign will focus on the positive and upbeataspects of reading, rather than the negatives of the neglect of reading.Too often our children are conditioned to believe that reading is work.We need to remind them that books open doors to new worlds which can providehours of personal enjoyment. After all, to master the skill of readingis a joy, not a chore.Promotion of the Year of the Young Reader has already begun. Organizationsand corporations that have agreed to participate in this important campaigninclude the American Library Association, the Association of Booksellersfor Children, CBS Television, the Children's Book Council, the InternationalReading Association, NBC Television, Pizza Hut, and Reading is Fundamental,Inc. In addition, the 15 State centers for the book, each affiliated withthe Library of Congress, will sponsor activities and programs to stimulatea love of books and reading among our Nation's youth.Mr. President, I have heard it said many times on this floor that our childrenare our future.

Mr. President, I am very pleased to join in introducing aresolution to designate 1989 as the ``Year of the Young Reader.'' It haslong been my view that young people are our Nation's greatest resource,and as we confront a world that is increasingly complex, both technologicallyand economically, it becomes even mor<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> important to do all we can to encourage and stimulatea love of reading and an appreciation of the importance of books and lite<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>r<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ature in our youth of today. Books and reading arecritical elements in providing useful nourishment for growing minds. Instillingin our children a joy of reading and an understanding of its importanceis one of the finest gifts we can offer. It is also the best way to ensurethe continuation of an informed and literate populace which is criticalto <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>democratic society.The introduction of this resolution seems especially appropriate as wecome to the conclusion of the 31st annual observation of ``National LibraryWeek,'' which as you know was celebrated April 17-23. Libraries have alwaysbeen an integral part of all that our country embodies; freedom of information,a<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>n<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> educated citizenry, and an open and enlightenedsociety_and of course libraries provide a unique and vital service in ourcommunities by making available a multitude of resources and programs toevery citizen in the community. But libraries are not merely passive repositoriesof materials. They are engines of learning, and are at the very centerof efforts to develop our Nation's <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>y<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>oung people into enthusiastic and thoughtful readers.I am

promotional strategies.Such activities might include programs and special events to highlightespecially important authors and books, educate parents on the varietyand characteristics of good

I have joined with the Floridacitrus industry and other members of the Florida congressional delegationin submitting for review a draft 301, unfair foreign trade practices, petitionto Clayton Yeutter, U.S. Trade Representative.I am very pleased with Ambassador Yeutter's actions so far, but he needsour support to fight these illegal quotas. I am told that Japan's AgricultureMinister Takashi Sato has received a petition signed by 25 million Japanesepeople against removing the quotas on beef and citrus.Mr. President, this resolution calls on the President and the United StatesTrade Representative to pursue complaints against Japan's obstructive citrusand beef import practices, seeking a favorable decision on behalf of theUnited States that Japan is in violation of the General Agreement on Tariffsand Trade.Assuming that the GATT panel does determine that the Japanese quotas areillegal, the President is encouraged to obtain a recommendation from theGATT contracting parties that Japan eliminate or otherwise bring into conformitywith the GATT provisions its citrus and beef import practices.I hope that an agreement acceptable to U.S. beef and citrus producers canbe negotiated to make the 301 petition null and void.

This agreement known as the Montreal protocol is a monumental achievementof worldwide cooperation to protect the <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>E<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>arth's atmosphere. Yet the protocol has not goneinto force.The Montreal protocol to date has only been ratified by the United Statesand Mexico. Eleven countries representing two-thirds of the world's productionmust ratify the protocol for it to take effect. The protocol must be enactedthis year if CFC production will be frozen on January 1, 1989.When the protocol was negotiated, we were told by the scientific communitythat by acting quickly long-term damage to the Earth's protective ozoneshield could be avoided. The adequacy of the protocol is now being questioned.Last month, the ozone trends report representing the views of over 100scientists concluded that the Antarctic ozone hole had become a permanenttear in the Earth's atmosphere and that significant depletion was occur<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>r<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ing in the Northern <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>H<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>emisphere during the winter months.Time is running out. Action is needed to begin addressing this problem.At the economic summit of the seven economic nations of the world lastyear, a commitment was made to take effective action to address the problem.As of today, the protocol has not gone into force. Yet, serious questionsare being raised as to the adequacy of this agreement.The seven nations who will participate in the upcoming summit in June areresponsible for over two-thirds of the world's production and use of ozone-depletingsubstances.These nations must immediately ratify the protocol, agree to review thescientific basis of the protocol and begin to immediately cease nonessentialuses of these substances.andCx.1;</ITAG>[S10MY8-823]{S5406}F<ITAG tagnum="66">F</ITAG>[S10MY8-824]{S5406}SENATE RES<ITAG tagnum="81">SENATE RESOLUTION 427_DIRECTING REPRESENTATION BY THE SENATE LEGALCOUNSEL</ITAG>[S10MY8-825]{S5406}BYRDMr. BYRD (for himself and Mr. <T4>Dole</T4>) submitted the following resolution; which was consideredand agreed to: [S10MY8-826]{S5406}S.

Taylor_named after the 12th President of the UnitedStates, Zachary Taylor_became a city on May 13, 1968. The history of Tayloris one of continued economic expansion. From WWII to 1970 the populationof Taylor Township grew from 5,000 to 70,200. Due to the population boom,there was an increased need for municiple services that a township couldnot provide, such as police and fire departments. Taylor has now provento be self sufficient on all of these fronts.Taylor has been a vital asset to this country. Before the 1960's Taylorwas primarily a farming and d<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ai<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ry community, producing much of the State's agriculture.Many of the residents also worked on the construction of many of the hugeships that sailed the Great Lakes. One of those ships, the U.S.S. <T3>Columbia, </T3>had been designated as an historical site and can befound on Boblo Island, located on the Detroit River.In the last 20 years, the growth in Taylor has been primarily commercialand residential with many of its residents working for the auto industry.Throughout the ups and downs of the auto industry, Taylor has managed tostand tall and steady as an independent city. Today Taylor is strongerthan ever. After visiting recently with some of the residents, I have realizedthat their com<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>m<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>unity spirit is alive and well. I feel it fittingto pay tribute to Taylor and wish them a festive week of celebration duringtheir 20th anniversary.andCx.1;</ITAG>[S10MY8-882]{S5410}F<ITAG tagnum="66">F</ITAG>[S10MY8-883]{S5410}THE PUBLIC<ITAG tagnum="81">THE PUBLIC PRINTER</ITAG>[S10MY8-884]{S5410}HATFIELD<ITAG tagnum="10">andCx.1; Mr. HATFIELD.

I also congratulatethe Public Printer for his achievements in making a Government agency runmore efficiently and for creating the environment for a new cooperativerelationship between labor and management at the GPO.Mr. President, I ask that the article to which I have referred be printedin the <T4>Record </T4>at this point.The article follows:</ITAG>[S10MY8-885]{S5410}[From Gove<ITAG tagnum="71">[From Government Executive, April 1988]</ITAG>[S10MY8-886]{S5410}PublicPri<ITAG tagnum="74">Public Printer Turns His Agency Around</ITAG>[S10MY8-887]{S5410}(ByAlan P<ITAG tagnum="71">(By Alan Paller)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">He may not be charged with securing the nation's defense, providingeconomic security for the elderly or improving the health of the Americanpopulace, but from a management perspective, the public printer has oneof the tougher jobs in Washington.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Confronting muscular unions and demanding, perpetually unsatisfiedcustomers, he controls the largest job printing shop in the world.

Customer comments about GPO servicewere unprintable. GPO employees were characterized as shirkers, as peoplewho simply did not care about quality, accuracy or timeliness.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Today, much of that has changed. Workers at all levels of GPO aregoing out of their way to serve. In what must be considered one of themost impressive turnarounds in government service, GPO's reputation forservice is at its highest level in a decade. Though there is still muchto be done, GPO provides a case study from which other government leadersmay learn.</ITAG>[S10MY8-888]{S5411}an unlikel<ITAG tagnum="89">an unlikely new leader</ITAG>[S10MY8-889]{S5411}<ITAG tagnum="21">The revolutionary who brought about this change was an unlikely candidateto turn around an organization employing about 5,100 people. He was a small-busine<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>sman from Savannah, Ga., running a family-owned printingcompany with 50 employees. Few would have expected GPO's predominantlyb<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>l<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ack work force, which is represented by 17 of thetoughest labor unions in government, to rally to this Southerner's goals.But rally they did.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">When Ralph E. Kennickell, Jr. was confirmed by the <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>S<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>enate as the public printer in December 1984, atage 39, he was the youngest person ever to hold the position.

Cash balances havegone up 150 percent. Employment has dropped by about 300 workers, withoutreductions in <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>o<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>utput. Waste is down.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Harder to see, but perhaps more important, is the change in mood aroundGPO. Employees seem excited about their work and their organization.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Kennickell took a four-pronged approach to turning GPO around. Hisfirst task was to tear up the four-page GPO mission statement and replaceit with one sentence. ``GPO,'' Kennickell wrote, ``will be a demand-driven,service oriented agency.'' In that one sentence, he told his customersthat their needs came first, and he told his people that service to GPO'scustomers was his and their top priority. To make certain GPO employeesknew their mission, he put it on a 40-foot banner mounted in the GPO cafeteria.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Complaints among GPO client agencies often had centered on communication.With a view to improving service through better communication, Kennickellput GPO account representatives on the road, visiting clients to show themhow they could reduce their printing costs by, for example, ordering standard-sizepublications. The account reps also help their clients fill out GPO paperwork and choose the paper and ink that will produce the best-looking productwithin the agency's budget.</ITAG>[S10MY8-890]{S5411}investing <ITAG tagnum="89">investing in people</ITAG>[S10MY8-891]{S5411}<ITAG tagnum="21">Kennickell's second step was an investment in the rank-and-file workers.He met with career leaders of the agency and asked for their ideas on improvingservice. Then he implemented those ideas.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">He also met with more than 4,000 of GPO's employees to press the fleshand to let them know who he was. Many of those employees had never beforeseen a Public Printer, except in a photograph. In those meetings, he spokeof fairness and equal opportunity.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">And he did more than just talk about equal op<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>p<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ortunity. He tripled the training budget, expandedthe upward mobility program, and rewrote the incentive program so thatmanagers could give instant bonuses for outstanding performance.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The upward mobility program focuses on employees below GS 9, althoughcomprehensive career guidance services are provided for all grades. Formalprograms have been set up to enable clerical employees to advance to technicalpositions and on to the professional ranks, and semi-skilled workers toadvance to journeym<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>n in the crafts. As often as they can, agency managersfill vacancies by promoting from within, waiving requirements for gatheringoutside applicants for the slots.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As part of the upward mobility effort, headquarters and field employeescan get assistance in filling out SF-171 forms, attend career planningseminars and receive periodic publications on steps to enhance their competitivenessfor higher level positions.

The new system offers datathat's much more timely and comprehensive than that provided by the oldsystem. It provides instant, easily understandable analysis of leave-timeused, inventory turnover and cash balance control. Spoilage of printedproducts was not tracked by computer in the old system, but is now, allowingquicker action to deal with spoilage problems.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>The EIS is not for <CODE-213>1</CODE-213>Kennickell<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>'s use alone. Instead, it is used to show managersthroughout GPO the data that the public printer considers necessary toeffectively manage the organization. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">To establish the EIS, Kennickell set up a team of information systemspeople and told them the key business problems he wanted monitored: responsivenessto customer needs, cash and revenue improvements, performance and severalothers. He asked them to ask his managers how they wanted to see the datarelating to each business goal. All he demanded was that the data be accurateand the graphics be interesting and easy for anyone to read and understand.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">When the team had the first version of the system together, they askedKennickell where he wanted his terminal. He said he didn't want the firstterminal; instead, the terminals were to go on supervisors' desks, wherethe data could do the most good.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">``I am not afraid of data, and I don't want my people to be,'' saysKennickell. ``Information is cheap. I just had to get the right informationto the right people and I knew they could do a better job.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The impact was immediate. One supervisor came to Kennickell to saythat he had always known there was a problem in his area, but it wasn'tuntil he saw the charts that he recognized that it could be fixed. ``Weknew that there was a press-downtime problem, and with EIS we could trackit,'' says Jim Hickey, superintendent of the GPO press division. ``We showedour supervisors the system, and they could see where the problems were.That improved productivity.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">After a few weeks, during which his managers got comfortable withthe system, Kennickell got his own terminal and immediately started makingchanges. He made certain that every performance chart also showed standards,so his people could see how well they were doing. He also added ``high-interestcharts'' to monitor short-term problems.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Today he uses the system to monitor costs and performance and to showvisitors graphic summaries of the results of his management program.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Kennickell's management program is not a magic wand that has erasedall problems. Some of GPO's customers still complain of contracting officersat GPO who contract-out printing to commercial companies that produce shoddywork. They are particularly frustrated by GPO's habit of allowing the sameoffice that made the contract decide whether a customer's claim of shoddywork is valid.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">But overall, GPO's clients laud the agency for a turnaround in customerservice.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Government's job is providing services and Kennickell has drawn aroad map to improved service that other agencies may wish to follow.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(<T3>Alan Paller is president of AUI Data Graphics in Washington.

Mr. President, on April 20, the Senate consideredand passed S. 1009, a bill to accept the findings and implement the recommendationsof the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians.It was, Mr. President, a difficult decision for me to vote against thebill. The internment and relocation of the Japanese Americans on the westcoast during World War II was a grievous error but it was an error madein good faith by American leaders who were engaged in <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>world war. The U.S. Government should make an officialapology to those who suffered this indignity and breach of their constitutionalrights. It is a very sad chapter in our history. I was therefore pleasedthat S. 1009 included such an apology.Although I believe the United States owes these citizens and resident aliensa formal apology, I regretfully came to the conclusion that, taken in itsentirety, S. 1009 was not wise. I was troubled by the condemnation in thebill of our war-time leaders and the compensation aspects of the bill.Many of these Americans fought with great valor and distinction in theEuropean theater later in the war, including our colleagues Senators <T4>Inouye</T4> and <T4>Matsunaga.</T4> As everyone in this Chamber knows, both served withhonor and were decorated for heroism in combat. Senator <T4>Inouye</T4> lost his arm in combat. All of us who enjoy freedom todaymust be thankful for their service and valor. I proudly salute them andall other Japanese Americans who served this country with such great distinction.It is clear that if we knew then what we know now, we would not have internedthese Americans. But it is also important to understand the setting inwhich this decision was made. One must remember that the Government ofJapan launched an unprovoked, surprise attack on Pearl Harbor on December7, 1941, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of American servicemen.The decision <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>to<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> intern these Americans of Japanese ancestry wasbased on an Executive order issued by President Roosevelt in February 1942.The Congress enacted legislation authorizing enforcement of that orderand the Supreme Court sustained the internment of the Japanese Americans.Thus, all three branches of Government approved and authorized this action.As I understand it, the decisions of the President and the military officerswho carried it out were based on military intelligence information whichsuggested that the Government of Japan had organized networks among ethnicJapanese in this country <ITAG tagnum="80">for the purpose of espionage and sabotage. I also understand thatthe FBI took a contrary view; namely, that they had no information supportingthat conclusion.</ITAG>We now know that the military intelligence was wrong, but in those earlydays of World War II, I believe that our national leaders made the decisionsthat they thought best for our country. We now know that the decision tointern the Japanese Americans on the west coast was wrong. An apology isclearly needed. But I am troubled by the tone of the language in S. 1009.It is one thing to conclude that the decision was wrong, but it is quiteanother thing to condemn those who made it. I, for one, do not wish toassociate myself with a condemnation of President Roosevelt, General Marshalland the others who led us to victory in that terrible war.With respect to the compensation question, I agree that more than an apologyis needed. But S. 1009 goes too far.Congress has previously approved several measures to compensate these individualsfor their losses. For example:The 1948 Japanese-American Claims Act which established a procedure foraffected individuals to file a claim for the loss of real and personalproperty. Over $37 million was paid in settlement of 26,578 claims.An amendment to the Social Security Act in 1972 which provided that thosepersons who were over 18 when they were in the relocation camps are deemedto have earned and contributed to the Social Security system for work performedin the camps.An amendment to the Federal civil service retirement provisions in 1978,to allow civil service retirement credit for the time spent in detentionafter the age of 18.S. 1009 <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>go<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>es much further. It provides for the payment of a$20,000 tax free payment to each individual who was interned. No one knowsthe total cost, but the bill authorized $1.3 billion for this program.The bill, in section 206, also established the ``Civil Liberties PublicEducation Fund Board of Directors'' which will be responsible for disbursingup to $100 million to sponsor public education about the relocation andinternment of the Japanese America<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ns<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>, to fund comparable studies of similar civil libertiesabuses, and for the general welfare of the ethnic Japanese community ofthe United States.Those are worthy goals, Mr. President, but there are other ethnic groupsin this country who have been the victims of Government misconduct in thepast. In particular American Indians and American blacks have cause forcomplaint against past actions of our Government. Is it fair to do thisfor Japanese Americans and not do the same for other Americans?Mr. President, money cannot restore the loss of liberty and the indignationsuffered by the loyal Ameri<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ca<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ns who were interned during the war. And money cannotbring to life the Americans who died during the war. There is much we canlearn from history, but we must also be honest about history and recognizethat those who made and enforced these decisions in the early days of WorldWar II thought they were doing what was right.Finally, Mr. President, I am troubled by the great cost of this programwhen there are so many other pressing demands on our budget.

Mr. President, on April 20, 1988, residents ofBarton, Jasper, Newton, and McDonald counties participated in a nationwideballoon launch sponsored by the national RSVP Association honoring thesignificant contributions of our Nation's senior volunteers.The Retired Senior Volunteer Program seeks opportunities for people age60 and over to better their communities through creative use of their energyand expertise. Beginning locally in 1981 with 31 volunteers, there arecurrently over 300 senior volunteers throughout the four counties. Thevolunteers are involved in projects ranging from carpentry work to helpingothers with tax forms to friendly visitation and ombudsman services. Inaddition to serving in over 50 public and nonprofit settings, RSVP volunteersincrease community knowledge about senior citizens through their skit troupe,``The Street Players.'' They are also the key to the success of such annualevents as the Over 60 Olympics and the Missouri Silver Haired Legislature.Last year volunteers contributed approximately 40,000 hours of communityservice. Their efforts represent a significant contribution to their communities'quality of life and should be a model of community involvement for allAmericans.andCx.1;</ITAG>[S10MY8-907]{S5413}F<ITAG tagnum="66">F</ITAG>[S10MY8-908]{S5413}KESSLER IN<ITAG tagnum="81">KESSLER INSTITUTE FOR REHABILITATION</ITAG>[S10MY8-909]{S5413}BRADLEY<ITAG tagnum="10">andCx.1; Mr. BRADLEY.

Mr. President, as a devoted proponent of smallbusiness in America, it is with pride that I rise today in recognitionof the achievements of N. Don Edwards, the ``Small Business Person of theYear'' from Connecticut. Here is an entrepreneur who epitomizes all thevirtues of small business. He began his specialty advertising businessin 1962 in the basement of his family's home with money from a second mortgageagainst that home and as much as he could borrow elsewhere. Twenty-fiveyears later, his firm employs 20 and generates total sales of just under$5 million.A tireless advocate of small business, Mr. Edwards was selected as oneof three small business advocates to testify before the Senate Committeeon Small Business in support of a permanent White House Conference on SmallBusiness. He was also a conference delegate to both the first and secondWhite House Conferences on Small Business and has been a recipient of numerousawards, including the ``Small Business Person of the Year Award'' in 1984presented by the Southwestern Area Connecticut Commerce and Industry Associationand the ``Jaycee's Outstanding Young Man of the Year Award'' for DistinguishedCommunity Service in 1967. Mr. Edwards is a valued member of my Small BusinesAdvisory Committee, as well as a member of the State of Connecticut SmallBusiness Development Center Advisory Board. And this is only the tip ofthe iceberg. The list of Mr. Edward's contributions to strengthen the roleof small business in the State of Connecticut and in the Nation is farlonger than I can cite here. Let me just give you a clue as to his reputationin Connecticut: he is referred to as ``Mr. Motivation.''While the N. Donald Edwards Co. is now a well established enterprise inStamford, CT, providing specialty promotional items, motivational marketingservices, incentives, awards and corporate recognition products, the pathto his current success was not devoid of struggle. The son of an Italianimmigrant, Mr. Edward's childhood surroundings were humble. In a factory-ownedapartment without running water_the plumbing consisted of a hand-pump wellin the backyard_Mr. Edwards learned a valuable lesson from his father:If you give more than is expected, you will be successful. The N. DonaldEdwards Co. slogan today echoes those fine sentiments: ``With More ServiceThan Seems Necessary.''Perhaps it was also Mr. Edward's father who inspired him to state recently,and I quote:</ITAG>[S10MY8-913]{S5413}<ITAG tagnum="21">The whole theme_today in America_is entrepreneurship * * * I thinkthe change has come about because people want to grow to their full potential.There's a burning desire to be the captain of their own ship, to controltheir own destiny and to be able to direct their business from stem tostern, from tears to cheers of creating and managing a business.</ITAG>It is those sentiments_magnified by Mr. Edward's ceaseless devotion tothe rightness of small business in America_that I salute today. I extendmy warmest congratulations to Mr. Edwards on his selection as ``Connecticut'sSmall Business Person of the Year'' and look forward to hearing about hisfuture contributions and success.andCx.1;[S10MY8-914]{S5414}F<ITAG tagnum="66">F</ITAG>[S10MY8-915]{S5414}TRIBUTE TO<ITAG tagnum="81">TRIBUTE TO BOB BALHORN</ITAG>[S10MY8-916]{S5414}PRYOR<ITAG tagnum="10">andCx.1; Mr. PRYOR.

Mr. President, I rise today for a most solemn andsomber purpose. On behalf of the Fraternal Order of Police, I would liketo take this opportunity to pay tribute to the 143 law enforcement officialswho lost their lives last year while diligently performing their duties.Almost half of these deaths were the result of felonious assault; the restwere caused by tragic accidents and mishaps. Although the cause of deathmay have varied from officer to officer, the quality of conscientious servicethey rendered did not. For these dedicated men and women, and for the officerswho gave their lives in year<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>past, we express our deepest thanks for their greatcorage and willingness to go to such lengths to protect our citizens andcommunities.  The finest public servants and the most outstanding citizens make up ourcountry's policy forces. They are the individuals who man the thin<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>blue line that protects law-abiding citizens frominjury and loss of property and life. I can o<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>n<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ly hope that the recognition we give here today willhelp their family and friends relaize that these officers did not die invain.  Since 1969, FOP National Chaplain <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>V<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>irgil D.

Known as the ``Rollcall ofHeroes,'' it is an acknowledgement of their sacrifice and a small way forus to give support to their families and loved ones who must carry on withtheir own lives, notwithstanding their and our tragic loss.  Mr. President, I ask that the remarks of Chaplain Penn be placed in the<T4>Record, </T4>along with the list of slain officers, the ``Rollcallof Heroes.''

Mr. President, the Senate recently passed legislationdesignating May 8-14 as ``Just Say No Week'' in an effort to increase thepublic's awareness of the problems related to drug abuse.As a former chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Alcoholism and DrugAbuse, I am alarmed by the growing incidence of drug abuse and drug relatedcrimes in Michigan and in the United States, and believe we must commitour Nation to an all out war on drugs. In stopping drug abuse, our Nationfaces one of its greatest single challenges in our history.Drug abuse is eroding the very foundations of our society that have madeus a great nation. Drugs rob our children of their opportunity to achievetheir potential. Drugs steal from our Nation the contributions of individualswhose lives are cut short through their drug dependency. Drugs threatenour economic stability and our ability to compete in international markets.Drugs promote crime and encourage disregard for the law by well-intentionedcitizens who are frustrated and desperate to stop the flow of drugs intotheir neighborhoods.How well we meet this challenge in the next few months and in the comingyears will have a lasting effect on our Nation well into the next century.We must wage war against drugs, and we must act now.Statistics on drug abuse show the epidemic size of the problem. Expertstell us that nearly 10 percent of all Americans or 26 million people useillegal drugs. A recent study entitled ``Controlling Drug Abuse: A StatusReport'' by the General Accounting Office (GAO) reports that the numberof cocaine related emergencies reported by hospitals jumped by 167 percentbetween 1983 and 1986 and that the number of cocaine-related deaths roseby 124 percent during the same period.It is estimated that during 1987 alone Americans spent some $140 billionto purchase 178 tons of cocaine, 12 tons of heroin, and over 60,000 tonsof marijuana. The use of illegal drugs further costs our Nation about $60billion a year in lost employment, for prison and other criminal justiceexpenses, and for drug treatment programs.In 1986 the Congress passed and the President signed into law the $1.7billion Anti-Drug Abuse Act designed to aid drug education and rehabilitationprograms and Federal, State, and local law enforcement efforts to combatdrugs. As a cosponsor of this legislation in the Senate, I believe it gaveus a good start in addressing the problems of drug abuse. But the mostrecent data suggest that much more needs to be done.To its credit, the administration, largely through the efforts of Mrs.Reagan, has conducted the energetic ``Just Say No'' to drugs campaign,and I commend Mrs. Reagan for her efforts in this area. But if we are tofight an effective and meaningful battle against drugs, I believe we needto say yes to a range of action steps that actually cuts down on drug supplyand drug use.We need stronger programs that educate our children about the horrors ofdrug addiction. We need more drug rehabilitation programs that help peoplerid themselves of their drug dependency. We need new initiatives that giveFederal, State, and local law enforcement the tools they need to get toughwith the drug pushers on the street and drug suppliers wher<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ver they are.We can and must win the war against drugs, but to be successful, we musthave the commitment of every man, woman, and child in the United States.If our Federal Government will mount a new and much stronger effort tofight the drug war, I believe our citizens will come forward to do everythingthey can to help us meet this national challenge.andCx.1;</ITAG>[S10MY8-928]{S5416}F<ITAG tagnum="66">F</ITAG>[S10MY8-929]{S5416}SPRING COM<ITAG tagnum="81">SPRING COMMENCEMENT AT SOUTH CAROLINA STATE COLLEGE</ITAG>[S10MY8-930]{S5416}HOLLINGS<ITAG tagnum="10">andCx.1; Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I had the pleasure of joiningthe students and faculty of South Carolina State College for their springcommencement this past Saturday in Orangeburg. There were two highlightsto the occasion, which I would like to share with my colleagues in theSenate.First, I was pleased to make the acquaintance of Lt. Gen. Henry Doctor,Jr., Inspector General of the U.S. Army, who was presented with an honorarydegree. Since entering the Army as a second lieutenant after graduatingfrom South Carolina State in 1954_where he earned an ROTC commission_GeneralDoctor has distinguished himself both in combat and in a succession ofpeacetime leadership roles. His many decorations and badges include theDistinguished Service Medal, Legion of Merit, and Bronze Star. GeneralDoctor is an American of exceptional character and achievement, and itwas an honor to meet him.Incidentally, Mr. President, I would point out that South Carolina StateCollege has an extraordinary record of turning out talented military officers.Its alumni include a brigadier general, a lieutenant general, and a majorgeneral currently on active duty, as well as a brigadier general retired.The fact is, no other ROTC program in the United States has produced moreblack officers than the program at South Carolina State. ROTC enrollmentat the college currently stands at 683 cadets. And, since the ROTC battalionwas established at South Carolina State in 1947, 1,584 students have receivedcommissions in the U.S. Armed Forces. The entire State of South Carolinatakes pride in this record of service.Mr. President, the second highlight of Saturday's festivities was the commencementaddress delivered by Dr. Harv<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>y B. Gantt. Of course, Harvey Gantt is well<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>-<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>known in the Carolinas as the first black graduateof Clemson University and former mayor of Charlotte, NC. I have valuedhis friendship for a quarter century. His remarks on Saturday_an appealto the graduates to involve themselves in politics and public service_werecharacteristic in their passion and eloquence.Mr. President, I ask that the full text of Dr. Gant<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>'s remarks be printed in the <T4>Record </T4>at this point.The remarks follow:</ITAG>[S10MY8-931]{S5416}Commenceme<ITAG tagnum="74">Commencement Remarks_Harvey </ITAG>B. <T4>Gantt, South Carolina State College, Orangeburg, </T4>SC<ITAG tagnum="21">To the distinguished dais members, Chairman of the Board of Trustees,President Smith, faculty, parents, friends, and members of the 1988 graduatingclass, I am privileged that you honor me by asking me to speak to you onsuch a significant occasion as this day. As a boy growing up in Charleston,South Carolina, the name State College was a revered institution, spokenof with great pride. And rightly so, for indeed much of the leadershipcadre for black South Carolinians came from this institution. Our doctorsand teachers, our lawyers and preachers, our business leaders and engineers_forthe most part came from State. We followed her athletic teams, marchedto the beat of her bands, and sampled the many cultural programs that offeredenlightenment. It has been, and still is, a beloved institution that contributesmuch to the well-being and quality of life of this state and nation_notwithstandingthe fact that her initial reason for existence stems from the legacy ofSouth Carolina's history of segregation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">You young men and women today then join a long line of special citizens,and I want to congratulate you on your significant achievement, and wouldsincerely hope that your new status as State graduates will be meaningfuland generate pride for you, the alumni you will join, and the people youwill serve in the years ahead.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">I hope before the day is over that sometime between the celebrationand the tears of leaving this place, you will find that special person_beit your parents, a relative, a spouse, or friend_that helped you when thegoing got tough, when you wanted to give up_that gave you encouragementto hang in there to the end. Say thank you, for it is a good reminder thatnone of us reach levels of achievement without the help and encouragementof others. You owe that moment to yourself and to those who cared so much.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">If you can assume that I will be relatively brief in my remarks, youwill all be conferred your degrees in about fifteen to twenty minutes.You will then become certified members of what I call the ``educated gentry.''Of great concern to me is how you will use this education to respond tothe world that will beckon to you. For many of you, you are a first inyour family with a college degree. The critical questions for all of youis how you wear this new mantle of distinction.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Sad to say that too many people don't wear it very well. Some seea college degree as a meal ticket_and while that is clearly a practicalconcern, the degree represents much more than that.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Others see the degree as a first step to getting more degrees; andwhile more formal education is good, there is a greater value than justbeing a scholar for life. And then there are some who view the degree asa distinct dividing line_that defines an elite class that separates youfrom the masses of those less learned . . . and in my opinion, those folkare the saddest and most </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">misguided, for they totally miss the real significance and potentialof what an educated gentry can mean for our society.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">I see you all differently. I see before me a cadre of men and womenwho are ready to do battle, in a world that desparately needs your help.I see men and women who have just been taught over four years or more thebasic rudiments of how to think, to solve problems, to inquire and searchfor truth. I see a vital force ready to bring fresh new ideas to old problems,to offer fresh perspectives and creativity on issues of eliminating injusticesand equity. I see an educated gentry that could challenge tired old concepts,and relieve tired warriors weary from years of long struggle. So my expectationsfor you are considerably higher than what you may be holding out for yourselves.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In 1988, we li<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>v<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>e in the best of times and the worst of times. Thereis an excitement in the air, largely generated by the fact that the windsof change in our national government is about to occur. For black Americans,many of us are excited and buoyed by the challenge being made by a greatSouth Carolinian_Jesse Jackson_as he makes a serious run for the Presidency.We see clear signs that many of us are making it successfully into themiddle class as evi<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>d<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>enced by advances in our personal wealth, o<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>u<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>r movement up the political ladder, and our steadyquest for first class citizenship. Without question, you graduates andall of us stand on the shoulders of many who have sacrificed and gone beforeus_and we reap<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> the<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> harvest from the seeds that our forebears plantedover the last 400 years.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">But these are also the worst of times. There is a fire that is beginningto burn out of control in communities across America_whether they be ruralhamlets and villages of the South or large urban centers of the North andMidwest. That fire manifests itself in a terrible human toll of peoplewho are increasingly becoming mired in a condition of hopelessness. Thisis the second America. Their numbers are still comparatively small_butthey are growing in numbers. Their race is disproportionately black. Theircharacteristics are all too familiar. Children who go to school but neverlearn to read. Homeless and ill housed families. Prisons loaded with youngblack males who have turned to crime as a way of life. Teenage babi<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>es<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> giving birth to babies. Single parent householdstrapped by a system that consigns them to a life of poverty. The rampantuse of drugs being sold to young and old. AIDS killing off people at analarming rate. I could go on_but you know what I'm talking about.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Without question, the folks who reside in this second America havenot appreciably benefited from the progress we've made over all these years.And their lack of progress threatens the well-being of all Americans, nomatter your race, or whether you're a Republican, Democrat, Liberal, orConservative.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">And while it might be easy to point fingers of blame_none of us areblameless for allowing this second America to burn out of control. Racismand discrimination are still very much alive_and may in fact be much moreovert because of the quality of leadership we have had in recent years.But I must <CODE-213>5</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>5</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">hasten to add, that the educated gentry_our own leadership has sometimeslacked the vision and the courage to stem this tide of human destruction_andthat is why I see you graduates as fresh troops that can help join thebattle to address the environment we face today. Oh, you will not solvethese problems that have been identified simply because you have had fouryears of College. You will not become overnight great civil rights leaders,great politicians, great businessmen, etc.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">But as an energetic new army of the educated gentry_what W.E.B. Duboiscalled the talented tenth_you can join the battle to help save our communityif you have your priorities in order and if you realize your potentialto bring change.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">There are only three things that I want to share with you that I thinkare important:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">First, wherever you go_be it town, city, village or hamlet, don'tever forget the history of your people and the struggle we have been engagedin for 400 years in America. That legacy of determination and commitmentto make it against great odds ought not be an excuse for bitterness noran albatross around your neck. It ought to be a source of pride that youforebears were strong enough mentally, physically, and spiritually to per<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>evere to a better day. Our history ought to be acall to arms, a r<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>llying cry to deal with the current politic<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> of this day and time. You have a moral responsibilityand obligation to pass it on to those who don't know who we are. Too manypeople today walk around aimless and misguided, and without pride becausethey don't know who they are<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>_<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>or where they came from.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">It does not matter that none of you experienced the degradation ofdrinking from a ``c<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>olo<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>red'' water fountain. It does not matter that younever were forced to sit at the back of the bus. It really isn't importantthat you never felt the humiliation of eating a lunch standing up, or sittingin the crow's nest of a movie theater. The fact is that your forebearspaid a high price to make sure you didn't . . . and it is incumbent uponyou to deal today with current problems to make sure that we never sufferthose indignities ever again.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">So don't become so <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>namored with you<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>r<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> new status and ignore the essential issues. First,you should all be registered voters. That ought to be a requirement forgraduation! Second, don't let me hear that you are so busy moving intothe black bourgeousie that you don't have time to support civil rightsorganizations. That's an obligation you can't ignore. And don't becomeso self-centered in you<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>r<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> quest for material wealth that you grow conservativeand fail to support those politicians who are genuinely concerned withimproving the education, training, and social well-being of those who arethe least among us. If you do, you dishonor the soldiers of the movementwho fought to preserve your right to vote.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The point is that if we appreciate who we are, we will fight on thebattleground of the political world today, to preserve and enhance thework of our forebears.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The second priority I want to share has to do with being good stewardsof your money. Achieving a measure of political strength without havingeconomic strength is like having a nice car with no gas. You can't go anywhere_orat least not very far. As a people we need stronger economic institutionsin the black community. That has been talked about for generations_andat one time during the segregation era, we had relatively stronger blackbusinesses and institutions. But to reverse a troubling trend, today, wemust reverse our attitudes toward our brethern who aspire to be producersand businessmen in our society. We must alter our thinking with regardto supporting black institutions that will improve the social well-beingof our citizens_particularly those in need of help. In short, we must loveand trust us more. That must come from nurturing a habit to spend moremoney with our own.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">We make more money now than we ever have before in our history_andyet we spend less than 10% in our own communities. Our charitable contributionsto church, social and civic organizations, educational institutions, etc.are disproportionately low compared to other groups in our society. Weuse the excuse that we are poorer_but that does not always hold water.For we consume goods and services disproportionately higher than many othersin our nation for clothes, cars, homes, etc.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">But if we spend our dollars at home_look at how much good we coulddo in helping the poor, or helping a boy's club, or starting a home forunwed teenage mothers. Look at how much more we could demand of wealthyblack businesses in supporting worthwhile causes that need financial resourcesin our community.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">There is a challenge here for you graduates. First, I hope that someof you will become producers and businessmen and women and lend new statusto that profession. But since most of you are likely to be consumers, Ichallenge you to measure your first year's expenditures in a new way andsee where you are placing your spending priorities. Check the amount ofdollars you will have given to worthwhile charitable black institutionsand organizations. Check the amount of dollars you will have spent withblack businesses. If you are not increasing that amount proportionatelyin the years ahead, then you are contributing to the economic paralysisof black America. And friends_we can't afford that, for in remaining meremidgets in the economic arena, we perpetuate a slave mentality of dependency.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Finally, let me suggest to you that it is important that you go hometo the ghetto communities across America. I want to challenge you to acceptthe responsibility and obligation of being role models. It is sad but truethat those who need to see us most often in the black community never getmuch of a chance anymore. It is ironic, but in the desegregated world oftoday, it is so easy for the educated middle class black to become physicallyso removed from the masses of black people . . . that eventually they canalso easily remove themselves mentally and spiritually. As a matter offact, black middle class America may well be losing its ability to commandthe respect and leadership it needs to have among those who are at thebottom of the economic ladder.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">There used to be a time that we lived together_doctor with sanitationworkers, teachers with janitors, preachers with domestic worker. Today,many youngsters never see those middle class role models. In their placesare those who would exploit the plight of the poor_drug pushers, pimps,con men, etc.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Young people, go home. You will find that you must make a consciouseffort to do so. Oh, I know you won't give up your nice condo, or house,in some nice neighborhood. I don't expect you to_but I do expect that youwill not become so busy and so sophisticated that you can't attend andparticipate actively in that Baptist or Methodist Church you grew up in.I do expect that you will give up some time from the golf course, or cardparty, to work with a group of young<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ters needing encouragement and motivation. I do expectthat you will miss a fraternity or sorority meeting to spend some timeworking with senior citizens who can benefit from your youth and enthusiasm.And I believe I ought to expect that you could provide some leadershipin working to increase voter registration and participation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">I am an optimist, and I expect great things from you. Your generationhas the potential for leading us to greater heights than we've ever known.But it will require your joining forces with those already doing battleand to make that education you've received these years here at State reallycount for something.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 1511,the Family Security Act, introduced by my colleague, the senior Senatorfrom New York [Mr. <T4>Moynihan</T4>]. This bill was recently reported out of the FinanceCommittee and is awaiting action on the Senate floor. S. 1511 reforms ourcurrent welfare system through the enforcement of child support and expandedopportunities in education and training.S. 1511 is designed to restructure public assistance programs in orderto promote fundamental American values_a strong sense of family and individualself-worth. This legislation strengthens the child support enforcementsystem. By increasing penalties for abandoning children, this legislationcreates an incentive to keep families intact. In addition, S. 1511 promotes training and employment for individuals whoare unable to find work. Specifically, the legislation encourages statesto provide work, training, and education activities to help welfare recipientsto move off of welfare assistance to employment. The main targets of thisprogram will be those who have been, or are likely to remain, on welfarefor an extended period of time, and, custodial parents under the age of24 who have little or no work experience or who have not completed highschool. This legislation is expected to cost about $2.85 billion over the next5 years. However, these costs are to be offset by measures included withinthis bill to make it budget neutral. It is my belief that this bill couldeventually save money as increased numbers of individuals are releasedfrom the burden of welfare and start contributing to society. Generational dependency upon welfare must be broken. I am hopeful thatS. 1511 will break this cycle. I commend my fellow New Yorker on his billand his long-time dedication to the desire for welfare reform. I am pleasedto lend my support to this legislation, and I look forward to working withmy colleague to overcome our serious welfare problems.andCx.1;</ITAG>[S10MY8-935]{S5418}F<ITAG tagnum="66">F</ITAG>[S10MY8-936]{S5418}A TRIBUTE <ITAG tagnum="81">A TRIBUTE TO MICHIGAN LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS KILLED IN THE LINEOF DUTY</ITAG>[S10MY8-937]{S5418}RIEGLE<ITAG tagnum="10">andCx.1; Mr. RIEGLE.

At that time, it was operatedin a rented facility on a part-time basis, with one employee. Today, HuntTractor employs more than 50 individuals, with locations in Louisvilleand Clarkson, KY. Its growth has been impressive, with sales increasingby more than 100 percent over the last 10 years.Mr. Hunt has also demonstrated strong leadership for the business communityand a commitment to the economic growth of <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>the <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Louisville area. His dedication has clearly transcendedhis interest in the development of his own business. Roy Hunt has servedas a delegate to the White House Conference on Small Business, as chairmanof the Center for Small Business in the Louisville Chamber of Commerce,and currently serves as chairman of the Kentucky Small Business AdvisoryCouncil. He has been actively involved in the reform of the worker's compensationsystem that has recently taken place in Kentucky, and has advocated theinterests of small business entrepreneurs in many contexts, legislativeand otherwise.Mr. President, Roy Hunt's leadership, dedication, integrity, and innovationhave made him a role model for small business persons across my State.In being named ``Kentucky Small Business Person of the Year,'' I believehe now can be recognized as a fine example for aspiring entrepreneurs nationwide.Although it has been said many times, it is still quite true that smallbusiness is the backbone of our economy. And with the efforts of individualslike Roy H. Hunt, this will continue to be the case in my <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>S<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>tate for some time into the future.As we continue Small Business Week, I rise to recognize and congratulateRoy Hunt and the other ``State Small Business Persons of the Year'' fortheir distinguished achievements.andCx.1;</ITAG>[S10MY8-941]{S5418}F<ITAG tagnum="66">F</ITAG>[S10MY8-942]{S5418}CONGREGATI<ITAG tagnum="81">CONGREGATION AHAVAS ACHIM BREAKS NEW GROUND</ITAG>[S10MY8-943]{S5418}LAUTENBERG<ITAG tagnum="10">andCx.1; Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate the congregationof Ahavas Achim which broke ground on April 24, 1988 for their new synagoguein Highland Park, NJ.The congregation has been in existence for almost 100 years. In 1889 agroup of recently arrived immigrants, as charter members, established AhavasAchim_Beloved Brothers. From 1889 to 1990, members met in private homesor rented stores. A building they bought from the Salvation Army finallybecame their house of worship. Over time the building was rennovated andmodernized, and in 1961 a beautiful new sanctuary was rededicated.Ahavas Achim thrived as an institution dedicated to Jewish life, whichincluded the founding of a Sisterhood, an active Hebrew School, and a leadingarea day school, Rabbi Pesach Raymon Yeshiva. But in 1980, on Yom Kippur,a tragic fire destroyed the sanctuary. An adjacent vestry room has servedthis purpose since.But the congregation did not despair its loss. Ground was broken recentlyfor a new synagogue. Its new location will be Highland Park, NJ.Mr. President, I am pleased to honor the efforts of Congregation AhavasAchim and its spiritual leader, Rabbi Ronald L. Schwarzberg. I extend mywarmest wishes for a bright future in their new house of worship and continuedsuccess as a dynamic force in the community as they approach their centennialanniversary in 1989.andCx.1;</ITAG>[S10MY8-944]{S5418}F<ITAG tagnum="66">F</ITAG>[S10MY8-945]{S5418}ROMANIAN A<ITAG tagnum="81">ROMANIAN AMERICANS</ITAG>[S10MY8-946]{S5418}SIMON<ITAG tagnum="10">andCx.1; Mr. SIMON.

Although the greatest numberof Romanians settled in the industrial heartland of America, their contributionshave been felt nationwide. The proud descendants of the first Romanianimmigrants to this country continue to assert their ethnic identity throughRomanian newspapers and cultural festivals.Unfortunately, as an independent state, Romania has had little opportunityto assert its self-determination. At the close of World War II, the SovietUnion occupied Romania. Since then, communism has stifled and continuesto limit Romania's economic and political freedom.Mr. President, I have proudly sponsored legislation including ``PolishAmerican Heritage Month,'' Baltic Freedom Day,'' and other resolutionsthat commemorate our country's ethnic celebrations. America is enrichedby people from all walks of life and all nationalities. Let us acknowledgethis diversity for what it is: a continual source of strength and greatness.I commend Romanian Americans and congratulate them on their anniversaryof independence.andCx.1;</ITAG>[S10MY8-947]{S5419}F<ITAG tagnum="66">F</ITAG>[S10MY8-948]{S5419}JOHN O.
