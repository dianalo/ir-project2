In other primaries Tuesday, Georgia voters picked a youngDemocratic attorney to take on Republican Rep. Newt Gingrich, afive-term congressman who has led efforts to force an investigationof House Speaker Jim Wright.   Colorado had primaries in six congressional districts, but onlyone pitched battle. State Rep. David Bath defeated former Secretaryof State Mary Estill Buchanan, who lost to Gary Hart in the 1980Senate race, in a race scarcely noticed by voters.   Elsewhere, Ralph David Abernathy III, son of the civil rightsleader, decisively won the Democratic nomination for a state Houseseat in Atlanta. Abernathy will meet Republican John E. Thompson inthe fall.   Jones, 47, had been rated the Democratic favorite against Rep.Pat Swindell in Georgia's 4th District race, both as a result ofhis 1986 campaign effort and his role as the mechanic ``Cooter'' on``The Dukes of Hazzard'' television show.   ``They laughed at us when we got in the ring two years ago.They're taking us seriously now,'' Jones told cheering supportersat his headquarters Tuesday night.   His opponents sought to counter that advantage by portrayingJones as too liberal, attacking Jones after he told a college groupin May he would be willing to consider legalizing drugs.   He acknowledged making the statement, but insisted that he alsotold the group he would consider that as an option only after amassive effort to eradicate drugs.   With all 220 precincts reporting unofficial totals, Jones had32,637 votes, or 62 percent; lawyer Nick Moraitakis, 10,832, or 21percent; and theater executive John Stembler, 8,814, or 17 percent.   Jones said Stembler's attempt to ``trash'' him played intoSwindall's hands. On the other hand, he praised Moraitakis fortaking a ``high road.''   In southern Illinois, Democrat Jerry Costello won a specialelection to fill the final 4{ months of the late Rep. Mel Price'sterm, but Republicans say the race was close enough to merit theircontinued attention in November.   ``We're extremely encouraged by all this,'' said Kenny Klinge,chairman of the National Republican Campaign Committee, despite thenarrow defeat of GOP candidate Robert Gaffner, a collegeadministrator.   So was Costello, who expressed confidence about winning a fulltwo-year term in November.   ``We're going to take the Republicans and the RepublicanNational Congressional Committee in the November election, too,''he told supporters. ``We're going to grab them by the nose and kickthem in the feet and make them like it.''   Costello, chairman of the St. Clair County Board and one of themost powerful Democratic Party leaders in the region, won the racewith 33,247 votes, or 51.5 percent, to Gaffner's 31,279, or 48.5percent, according to unofficial returns.   Price, a Democrat, died in April after nearly 44 years inCongress.   In Georgia's 6th District race to oppose Gingrich, unofficialreturns from 211 of 218 precincts showed David Worley, a30-year-old attorney, with 32,134 votes or 56 percent tobusinessman Clyde Owens' 25,411, or 44 percent. Worley had thebacking of Georgia House Speaker Tom Murphy.   Worley focused more on Gingrich than on his Democratic rivalduring the primary campaign, saying at one point that Gingrich'sfive terms in Congress represented ``10 years of double-talking,double-dealing and deceit.''   Gingrich accused Worley of running a ``remarkably negative andinaccurate campaign'' and said he would debate the challenger inevery county of the district.   In all, eight of Georgia's 10 congressmen won renominationwithout opposition in the primary election. Both of those opposedwere victorious.</TEXT></DOC>
