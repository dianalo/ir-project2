But many economists believe that joy ride may be over, although smart shoppers should still be able to find mortgages at reasonable rates.    In the past two months, rates on fixed-rate mortgages have jumped roughly three-quarters of a percentage point, while the short-term rates that determine many adjustable-rate mortgages have increased slightly more than a half point.    Growing inflationary pressures and the persistent budget and trade deficits lead many economists to believe rates will continue to rise. Many think 30-year fixed-rate loans could hit the mid-11% range by year end, up from roughly 10.5% currently. And mortgage lenders say they may have to increase rates on many ARMs by nearly two percentage points, the maximum increase allowed for most adjustable loans.    Nevertheless, options abound for home buyers who rely on ARMs tied to volatile securities such as Treasury bills and certificates of deposit, as well as individuals seeking a new mortgage or a refinancing of an old one. Because lenders are aggressively seeking new loans, it isn't difficult to find, or convert into, a more stable ARM or a fixed-rate loan at reasonable cost.    Of course, economists could be wrong about the interest-rate trend. And any recession that would normally follow high interest rates would eventually produce lower rates. But in the current interest-rate climate, some lenders say ARMs tied to volatile indexes are too risky when compared to alternatives.    One such alternative is an ARM tied to an index of lenders' weighted average cost of funds, either nationally or by Federal Home Loan Bank districts. In California, the most popular ARM is one with a monthly interest rate that floats 200 to 275 basis points above the cost of funds in the 11th Federal Home Loan Bank district, which includes California. A basis point is equal to 0.01 percentage point. Currently, such ARMs average as low as 7.2%, after discounting, to a market rate of 9.4%.    This kind of index is much less volatile than the most popular ARM nationally, which carries a 225 to 275 basis point spread above short-term Treasuries. In the huge rate increase of 1980-1981, the rate on one-year Treasury notes jumped to a high of 16.71%, but the 11th district index hit a high of only 12.67%.    &quot;The highs for the cost-of-funds index aren't as high as the Treasury index, and the lows aren't quite as low,&quot; says David L. Todd, director of corporate planning for Great Western Financial Corp., Beverly Hills, Calif. The reason: The cost-of-funds index reflects a large amount of stable, low-cost savings and demand deposits. Indeed, in the past three months, this index has actually declined as deposits have surged after the October stock-market crash; the Treasury index rose almost a full percentage point in the same period.    Moreover, ARMs based on the 11th District cost-of-funds index carry an annual cap of 7.5% on payment increases, while many Treasury-based ARMs carry an annual interest-rate cap of two percentage points. Thus, a borrower who took out a 9% Treasury-based ARM for $100,000 could face an 11% rate in one year, representing a 22% increase in monthly payments.    Another alternative is simply converting to a fixed-rate loan, eliminating interest-rate risk altogether.    Consumers can now buy ARMs with a convertibility feature. Homeowners with such loans can elect to switch to a fixed rate, usually after the mortgage's first year, and before its fifth but at a cost. These mortgages typically carry higher interest rates of from one-half to three-quarters of a percentage point, plus an average lenders' fee of $250 and one-half to one percent of the loan balance.    Even for homeowners who are stuck with a volatile ARM without a convertibility feature, it is still relatively inexpensive to convert to either a cost-of-funds ARM or a fixed loan. Most lenders will demand a fee equal to 2% of the balance of the loan, but bargains are available as thrifts and banks try to invest the $89 billion of new deposits that have poured into their vaults since the October crash.    For instance, Home Savings of America, the nation's largest thrift and a unit of H.F. Ahmanson andamp; Co., Los Angeles, currently offers a cost-of-funds ARM at 9.4%, plus a one-time fee of half a percentage point on the loan's balance outstanding and $250. Goldome Realty Credit Corp., a unit of Buffalo, N.Y.-based Goldome bank, will refinance ARMs into fixed-rate loans for no points, for current customers.    Mortgage borrowers should compare the cost of conversion to their assessment of the risk from rising rates. For example, a Treasury-indexed, $100,000 ARM at 9.5% would face an increase of $150 a month, or $1,800 a year, if the rate jumped to 11.5%. That borrower could convert to, say, a 9.4% cost-of-funds ARM or a 30-year fixed loan at 10.5% for fees and escrow costs of about $2,250, assuming a loan-origination charge of one-half percentage point.    This $2,250 amount would be recouped in 30 months under the 10.5% fixed-rate mortgage, compared with the ARM at 11.5%. As for the 9.4% cost-of-funds ARM, it would be more than $1,000 cheaper over a one-year period compared with the 11.5% Treasury-based ARM.    For financially sophisticated owners of expensive homes, one risky but potentially effective way to protect against fluctuations in ARM rates is to hedge, using interest-rate futures contracts. For instance, an 8%, one-year, Treasury-based ARM on a $500,000 mortgage requires monthly payments of $3,669. Should the rate increase to 9%, payments would increase to $4,017 a month, an annual increase of $4,176.    To hedge against the rise, a homeowner could sell two $1 million Treasury bill contracts for delivery in one year, through any large securities broker. As Treasury rates rise, the value of the contracts increase. A one-percentage point rise in Treasury rates would result in $5,000 of gains on the two contracts, covering the $4,176 payment increase on the 9% ARM.    But lenders and brokers warn that the practice is a high-risk venture that requires steely nerves. Interest rates seldom rise or fall in a straight line. A one-percentage point decline, even for a day or two, results in a $5,000 loss on the two contracts that must be deposited immediately with the broker. But if short-term rates are still down toward the end of the one-year contract, the futures losses will be offset by lower mortgage payments.    &quot;I'm not sure I would recommend it for Joe Homeowner,&quot; says a spokesman for the Chicago Board of Trade, which handles most interest-rate futures trading. &quot;It might be too costly and require too much maintenance.&quot;    ---                       Burden of ARMs         How the home-loan market breaks down         between adjustable and fixed-rate mortgages                        Adjustable-             Fixed-Rate    Year                Rate Loans              Loans    1983                   28%                     72%    1984                   52%                     48%    1985                   41%                     59%    1986                   25%                     75%    1987                   36%                     64%    April 1988             48%                     52%    Source: Mortgage Bankers Association</TEXT></DOC>
