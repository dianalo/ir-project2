About 1,000 employees, a quarter of the workforce, decided they'd had enough and walked off the job.   Emotions were running high, and the list of complaints waslong. More than 100 workers in the past 10 years hadcontracted job-related illnesses. The factory wasn'tsupplying enough shoes for those working on the oily factoryfloor, and each worker was allotted only two uniforms a year.More immediately, the government was going to raise foodprices in April and had frozen salaries.</LP><TEXT>   Railway Ministry officials, fearful that a prolongedstrike at the country's only producer of spare railway partswould throw the nation into chaos, offered concessions: a 50%pay increase and a further 40% in a few months, subsidizedlunches and three additional vacation days.   In six days, the strike was over. By the following week,even the strike committee had disbanded. The short-livedstrike is typical of the Soviet labor movement today. For thefirst time in the history of the communist state, thousandsof workers are now taking to the picket lines -- and thenabandoning longer-range demands in exchange for economicconcessions doled out by the government.   &quot;There was just no hope of changing anything,&quot; saysVladimir Ozhogov, a turner at the Lublino factory who helpedorganize the strike. Of his fellow workers, he says, &quot;Theyjust lost confidence.&quot;   If ever there was a time to organize a labor movement inthe Soviet Union, this is it. Coal miners showed the power ofa strike with their two-month walkout this spring. Glasnosthas permitted a certain freedom of expression. Democraticpoliticians, such as Russian President Boris Yeltsin, haveadvocated workers' rights. Some intellectuals are trying toorganize a Polish Solidarity-type movement that could spurdemocratic reform. The American AFL-CIO has recently steppedup its aid, offering trips to Washington for labor leaders,providing computer links and promising to expose anyharassment from the KGB as human rights violations.   &quot;The whole future of our reforms depends on whetherthere's a real union between the workers and the democrats,&quot;says Leonid Gordon, a labor expert at the Academy ofSciences. He hopes workers will gain enough strength tobecome &quot;like the atomic bomb of social conflicts.&quot;   But a Soviet version of Solidarity seems a remotepossibility. Polish workers saw a clear enemy in theCommunist Party, but many Soviet workers still depend on theparty to look after their welfare. Despite glasnost, there isan air of political uncertainty that scares many workers.Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev has banned strikes, and inMay he decreed that strike leaders would be subject tocriminal prosecution.   &quot;I'm sure there will never been anything like Solidarityhere,&quot; says Ilya Shablinsky, a lawyer who has been active inthe independent movement. Adrian Karatnycky, a representativeof the AFL-CIO's international office, is more optimistic.Today's strikes are merely the first wave, he says. Soon, hesays, workers will become a true, independent politicalforce.   Labor dissatisfaction undeniably is growing. Unemploymentis increasing as shortages of raw materials close downhundreds of factories. The government estimates two millionpeople have already lost their jobs. Economists say 10million to 40 million more could be displaced under atransition to a market economy.   Unhappiness with the Communist Party and the Kremlin arealso growing. With the average monthly salary at about 230rubles, ($8.50 at the tourist exchange rate) many workers areapproaching a poverty-level existence. Prices for bread havetripled. Meat has doubled.   Labor organizers like Mr. Shablinsky are primarilyanti-communist and pro-free market. Workers, he says, mustbecome an independent force and learn to see how they werebeing lied to by the party. One of the first things hepointed out to the Lublino workers last year was that whilemanagement was saying it would modernize the shops andimprove working conditions, the existing contract said thework was supposed to have been done in 1989.   Adds Yuri Antropov, a factory worker from Yaraslavl,&quot;Communist ideology stands in the way of making money becauseprogress is possible only when a person thinks of his ownprofits.&quot;   The gigantic Lublino steel works, in a run-downneighborhood in east Moscow, exemplifies the communist ideal.Its 4,000 workers live in factory-supplied housing, theirchildren attend factory schools and in the summers theyvacation at the factory's subsidized Black Sea resort.   The factory also exemplifies communist shortcomings. For20 years, the Moscow City Council has been trying to closedown Lublino's outdated molding shops because they spewhazardous dust and gas into the air. The shops have beencited by the city as the leading cause of illness at theplant, where job-related diseases have doubled to 14 workersa year for the past five years. But the Railway Ministry,which controls the factory, has prohibited a shutdown becauseLublino is the sole producer of railroad spare parts.   Before January, there had never been a strike there. &quot;Weweren't ready for it,&quot; says Boris Belovodsky, 54 years old,the factory manager, who has spent his entire career there.But a small group of workers in the plant, including Mr.Ozhogov, had been planning the strike for several months.Each week, they met with Mr. Shablinsky and drafted theirdemands. In addition to the pay increases and better workingconditions, they wanted the factory to be transferred fromthe jurisdiction of the Railway Ministry to the moreeconomically progressive Russian republic. They also wantedto be included in the republic's proposed privatization plan.   The moment the strike began, the workers' representativessplit over whether a strike was the best way to handle theirproblems. Victor Baltsez, the factory's official trade unionrepresentative, told the workers that they were breaking thelaw and would end up with a lawsuit if they continued. &quot;In anormal economy, you can have strikes to deal with problems,&quot;he says. &quot;But in ours, it only leads to more problems.&quot;   Factory manager Belovodsky personally went to bat over thepay increases. A former molder himself, he says hesympathized with the workers on this issue, and the strikehelped him make his case to the Railway Ministry. Theministry agreed to raise the average salary of 300 rubles amonth to 440 rubles a month effective March 1. On May 1, itwent up to 500 rubles a month.   Shortly after the Lublino walkout, the workers committeefell apart. The government filed suit claiming the strikeviolated the government's ban. So Mr. Ozhogov says he and theother organizers now spend all their time going to court. Thefactory won't pay them for the days they are away from theirjobs.   Now, says Mr. Ozhogov, &quot;We are trying to figure out how topay our legal expenses.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
