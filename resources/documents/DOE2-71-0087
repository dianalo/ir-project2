Theseresults indicate that the pancreatic cancer is resistant to irradiation,which could be explained by the existence of hypoxic cells consistingof 35 % of the tumor. ii) The dose of intraoperative irradiation (10- 40 Gy) seemed to be insufficient to bring long-term anti-tumor effectand long-term survival since that dose resulted in only temporary regressionof the tumor. iii) The hypoxic cell sensitizer (RK28), which is knownto specifically enhance the sensitivity of hypoxic cells to irradiation,lowered TCD/sub 50/ of the pancreatic cancer to 53.8 +- 1.57 Gy. Therefore,RK-28 was effective in the treatment of the experimental pancreatic cancer(the enhancement ratio : 1.37). When combined with 30 or 40 Gy of irradiation,which is applicable to intraoperative irradiation, RK-28 induced a longerperiod of tumor suppression and a higher tumor regression ratio thanirradiation alone. These results indicate that RK-28 significantly increasesthe effect of intraoperative irradiation and this combination therapycould possibly induce remarkable effect on tumor regression and long-termsurvival.</TEXT></DOC>
