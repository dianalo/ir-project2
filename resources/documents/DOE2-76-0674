<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-76-0674 </DOCNO><TEXT>An improved ultrasensitive digital dosimetric system has been developedfor the spatial mapping of small radiation fields using a CaF/sub 2/:Dyphosphor. A 1 mm thick, 25 mm diameter optically flat crystal is exposedto radiation and its subsequent thermoluminescence image is viewed byan intensified charge injection device (ICID) camera directly coupledby a tapered fibre-optic extender to the heated crystal. Video outputsare then digitised by a computerised real-time frame-grabbing systemhaving image processing and analysis capability. Spatial resolution measurementsof the system have indicated a resolution limit of 83 +- 4 {mu}m (1{sigma})corresponding to 6 +- 0.3 line pairs/mm measured at the 4% level of themodulation transfer function (MTF). This result is consistent with themeasurements of the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the line spreadfunction (LSF) obtained by the slit method. The system is capable ofmapping small radiation fields and the edges of larger fields using absorbeddoses as low as 0.2 mGy with good precision and wide dynamic range. Somemeasurements are presented for this purpose.</TEXT></DOC>
