Basic theory about the optical fiber technologywas studied and the developed techniques for nuclear facilities werereviewed. Since the radiations change the characteristics of the opticalfiber, the effects of {gamma}-ray irradiation on single mode and multimodeoptical fiber were examined. The image transmission system through opticalfiber bundle was designed, constructed, and tested. Its software systemwas also updated. It can be used for remote internal inspection in adverseenvironment.</TEXT></DOC>
