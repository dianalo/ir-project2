A meeting to put the finishing touches on a tentative agreementwas postponed repeatedly. Prince Saud al-Faisal, the Saudi foreignminister, met with George Saddeh, a Christian member of theparliamentary committee who stormed out of a meeting Thursday night.   Edmond Rizk, a Lebanese deputy, said the two agreed ``on aunified formula on the issues that caused the postponement.'' Hewould not give details, but said the Syrian role in Lebanon was notdiscussed.   Conference sources said they expected a full meeting Saturday ofthe 63 legislators, who must approve any agreement reached by the17-member negotiating committee.   Saddeh, who leads the right-wing Phalange Party, accused Moslemson Thursday of making ``crippling demands.'' He did not specify thedemands, but sent a note to the press center saying ``they affectintrinsic issues'' and ``cannot be accepted under anycircumstances.''   According to the sources, Syrian-backed Moslem legislatorsinsisted on greater political concessions by the Christians, whomade their own demands about Syrian withdrawal.   Syria has 40,000 soldiers in Lebanon under an Arab Leaguepeacekeeping mandate issued in 1976, one year after the outbreak ofa sectarian civil war that has cost more than 150,000 lives.   Gen. Michel Aoun, the Christian army commander, has declared a``war of liberation'' to drive the Syrians out.   Artillery battles between Aoun's forces and a Moslem allianceled by the Syrians, which began March 8, killed more than 900people and wounded nearly 3,000 before an Arab League cease-firetook effect Sept. 22 and the legislators met in Taif to seek asolution.   Lebanese sources said Saadeh walked out Thursday night as Sunniand Shiite Moslem lawmakers argued over the powers of theparliament speaker, traditionally a Shiite. They said deputies heldside consultations Friday in an effort to head off furtherdisagreement.   On Thursday, conference sources said the committee had reachedpreliminary agreement on a ``national reconciliation charter'' andwould meet Friday to complete the document.   Aoun declared in Beirut a few hours later that the deliberationswere irrelevant and he would continue his war on the Syrians.   ``We cannot rebuild our country under the shadow of an occupyingforce,'' he declared.   As-Safir, a leftist Beirut newspaper, said Aoun's remarksamounted to a ``public and direct threat'' to Christian legislatorsin Taif against making major political concessions withoutguarantees of a swift Syrian withdrawal.   Sources gave no details of the tentative accord, which must beapproved by all 63 legislators attending the Taif meeting. Beirutradio stations close to the factions said it included a ``limitedand phased'' Syrian withdrawal and political reforms that reducethe president's power.   Under an unwritten covenant observed since independence fromFrance in 1943, the president is Christian the prime minister aSunni Moslem and the parliament speaker a Shiite.   The Arab League peace plan, on which the cease-fire is based,envisages gradual abolition of sectarianism and Syrian withdrawalto eastern Lebanon within two years while law and order is restoredand militias disbanded.   Christians demand complete Syrian withdrawal within two monthsand Moslems want an equal share of political power, which theChristians say they won't allow without guarantees about thepullout.   Lebanon's Christians were the majority in 1943 and havedominated the government, parliament, judiciary and army. Moslemsmake up 55 percent of the 4 million people and demand more power.</TEXT></DOC>
