Republican GeorgeBush's camp said he hasn't decided what to cut to finance his $600million educational incentive plan.   Jackson, talking with leaders of black organizations inWashington, said today the ``most critical'' policy item for himnow is moving the Democrats to his budget priorities, which includeincreasing taxes on the wealthy and freezing defense spending topay for a variety of social programs.   He told reporters he has no intention of joining the formerDemocratic candidates who endorsed Dukakis after the Massachusettsgovernor won enough delegates to clinch the nomination at nextmonth's convention. ``They lost and surrendered. I did not. We'renot in the same category,'' he said.   Meanwhile, Dukakis campaign chairman Paul Brountas scouted inWashington for potential Dukakis running mates.   Campaign and congressional aides said Brountas would spend thenext few days consulting party leaders and others, including twosenators often mentioned as potential vice presidential candidates_ John Glenn of Ohio and Bill Bradley of New Jersey.   Bush, confronted with yet another poll giving Dukakis adouble-digit lead, gave no clues Tuesday when he was asked whetherretiring White House chief of staff Howard Baker might have a placeon his ticket.   ``No talk about a vice president,'' Bush said. ``It's tooearly.''   Baker said in an interview that ``you don't turn down requests''to be on the national ticket. But he said of running for vicepresident, ``I do not want to do that, I do not expect to do that,and I think it's extremely unlikely I would be asked to do that.''   He said he had told Bush he was quitting but did not raise theissue of whether he might be available as a running mate.Laughingly, Baker added, ``More important, he's never discussedthat with me.''   Bush's new campaign press secretary, Sheila Tate, was askedtoday on CBS-TV about the ``gender gap,'' a reference to polls thatshow the vice president with far more support among men than women.   ``That seems to be a traditional Republican polling problemwhich often disappears when you get close to an election,'' shesaid. ``As the voters, male and female, focus after theconventions, that gender gap as we call it will go away.''   Dukakis on Tuesday continued his campaign on the drug issue,meeting aboard an idled Coast Guard cutter in South Bedford, Mass.,with members of a local drug task force.   The vessel was idled because of a 55 percent cut in the CoastGuard budget agreed upon by Congress and President Reagan. Dukakissaid the administration must bear most of the blame.   ``Of course Congress shares the responsibility,'' he said. ``Butthe leadership has to come from the White House.''   Dukakis said that he would restore the Coast Guard funding ifelected, calling the agency the ``first line of defense'' againstdrugs.   Dukakis had meetings planned today with New York law enforcementofficials and with new state police recruits. He also planned tomeet with his anti-crime council and announce the latest additionsto the state's violent fugitives list.   Bush on Tuesday laid a cornerstone of his plan to be ``theeducation president,'' proposing a $500 million recognition programwith $100,000 awards for schools that improve the performance ofdisadvantaged students.   Bush also called for awarding states $1 million each for``experimentation and innovation'' in areas such as merit pay forteachers and year-round schools.   ``Our program for the future must be built around a strategy ofinvesting in our children,'' Bush said.   Charles W. Greenleaf Jr., Bush's domestic affairs adviser, saidthe new proposals outlined on Tuesday are ``by no means all'' ofBush's educational plans. Additional ones will be detailed thissummer, he said.   Greenleaf said that the total $600 million pricetag would haveto be offset by savings in other areas under Bush's ``flexiblefreeze'' proposal to hold overall federal spending to the rate ofinflation, but no decisions have been made on where those cutswould be made.   Bush has maintained an upbeat stance in the face of pollssuggesting he trails Dukakis.   The latest of those, conducted by Gallup for the Boston Globe,radio station WEEI and television station WCVB in Boston, found 52percent support for Dukakis and 38 percent for Bush. Results of thepoll, conducted June 10-12 among 1,005 registered voters, had amargin of error of four percentage points.   ``I don't believe in polls at this time. I really don't,'' Bushtold reporters Tuesday.   The presidential primary season came to its official end Tuesdayin North Dakota. For all practical purposes, it had ended a weekearlier with races in California, New Jersey, New Mexico andMontana.   Because of the late date, no Democrats bothered to file. On theRepublican side, Bush was opposed by Mary Jane Rachner, a retiredteacher who says the spirits of her late mother and grandmothertold her to run.   With 16 GOP delegates at stake, Bush, who long ago wrapped upthe GOP nomination, was piling up 88 percent of the vote.</TEXT></DOC>
