The big brewery said the Federal Alcohol Administration Act is unconstitutional because it denies the public its right to know the content of beer. And, Coors said, the law is discriminatory because makers of wine and distilled spirits are required to disclose alcoholic content by volume of their beverages when the alcohol exceeds 14% of the volume. Also, vintners may disclose the alcoholic content of low-alcohol wines.    Coors said beer drinkers are concerned about how much alcohol is in beer, and it cited recent surveys that indicated that consumers want to know more about what is in beer. It asked the court to allow all brewers the right to display alcoholic content by volume in beer. </TEXT></DOC>
