Wall Street is startingto agree.   Despite several rounds of cost-cutting since the 1987stock market crash, pay levels at U.S. brokerage firms hit arecord last year, $82,714 for the average employee, nearlydouble the level of a decade ago. &quot;Much more needs to bedone&quot; in rolling back compensation levels on Wall Street,urges the Securities Industry Association, the industry'smain trade group.</LP><TEXT>   In its annual review of Wall Street -- this one called&quot;From Riches to Rags&quot; -- the securities association noteswhat it says is an alarming trend. Since 1980, pretax profitsin the securities industry have plummeted from $16,182 anemployee to $8,093 last year. However, compensation (salariesplus bonuses) continues to soar.   Because it doesn't cost Wall Street much to physicallyproduce its products and services, compensation costs are theindustry's biggest expense aside from interest costs.   During raging bull markets, Wall Street typically payslittle heed to costs. But now the industry is forced to.While revenues for the 355 brokerage firms that are membersof the New York Stock Exchange rose 15% last year to $60billion, rising expenses hammered pretax profits, which fell26% to $1.8 billion, the third-lowest profit of the 1980s.(Only profits in 1984 and 1987 were lower.) Pretax profitmargins have slipped from double digits in the early 1980s to3.1% last year.   Why is Wall Street still paying itself so much? Tradition,complains the securities association's research chief,Jeffrey Schaefer.   Although the securities industry has slashed 45,000employees from its work force since the 1987 crash, a cutbackof nearly 20%, &quot;the bulk of departmental trimming began withstaff overcapacity, and the first to go were part-timers,temps, etc., but rarely the higher-paid department heads orstaff,&quot; Mr. Schaefer says. The result: &quot;Per-employeecompensation continues to rise even as profits plummet.&quot;   Overall compensation costs slipped last year at thebiggest brokerage firms because of all the layoffs. But therising pay-per-employee figures mean that Wall Street isstuck in a big-pay mode that will cause continual problems,says the securities association.   Samuel Liss, brokerage industry analyst at SalomonBrothers Inc., questions the relevance of &quot;per-employee&quot;statistics. But he agrees that Wall Street has relied toomuch on trimming staff, rather than taking a hard look at howit pays survivors.   &quot;Historically,&quot; says Mr. Liss, &quot;the business has too oftendefined expense control as being totally dependent on headcount, rather than a reset of compensation schemes.&quot;   Some big brokerage firms -- including industry giantsMerrill Lynch andamp; Co. and American Express Co.'s ShearsonLehman Hutton Inc. -- are making fresh attempts at linkingemployee pay with the firm's performance, much as was doneduring Wall Street's old private-partnership days. However,in general, even incentive pay in the industry is too oftentied to how much revenue is generated, rather than actualprofit, says the securities association.   This revenue focus &quot;will just perpetuate the industry'strend of growing revenues and declining profits,&quot; theassociation's report says.   The association says that Wall Street pay schemes are&quot;often irrational.&quot; For example, systems and secretarialpersonnel working for a capital-markets division may get paidmore than similar workers in the operations division, &quot;eventhough they basically perform the same function.&quot; Also, thesecurities industry tends to pay such workers more than theircounterparts in other industries.   As for high-priced investment banking and broker talent,Wall Street is in a bind. Firms find themselves forced toante up big bucks, even during bad years, to keep topproducers from jumping to competitors -- or as Mr. Liss putsit, to &quot;the liquid secondary market for disgruntledproducers.&quot;   Other observations in the securities association report:                                                                                                          PRIVATE PLACEMENTS: For the first time, the amount ofmoney raised through private-placement stock issues in 1989matched that raised in the public markets. The overallprivate placement market, including both stocks and bonds,accounted for 40% of total funds raised, twice 1980'spercentage.                                                                                                          IN-HOUSE TRADING: Trading gains for securities firms' ownaccounts soared 9.2% to $12.3 billion in the year, accountingfor one-fifth to one-quarter of industry revenue.                                                                                                          MONEY MANAGEMENT FEES: One focus of the securitiesindustry has been an unqualified success. Fees from moneymanagement activities soared 18% to $2.2 billion in 1989.                                                                                                          REGIONAL BROKERAGE FIRMS: Brokerage firms based outsideNew York enjoyed a resurgence in the past year, but not asgreat as some have believed. Profits slipped after peaking inthe second quarter, and profitability &quot;wasn't evenly enjoyedby all regional firms.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
