The plan, which the Office of Thrift Supervision claimedcould reduce taxpayer costs in the final phase of thesavings-and-loan cleanup, has been criticized on CapitolHill, particularly because equity of the owners of weakinstitutions would be partly protected.</LP><TEXT>   Moreover, some lawmakers, including House BankingCommittee Chairman Henry Gonzalez, (D., Texas), claim theplan is illegal. Rep. Gonzalez contends the law limits theuse of bailout funds only to the protection of depositors infailed thrifts -- not their owners.   Mr. Bowsher, testifying before the Senate BankingCommittee, didn't specifically address the merits of such aplan, but contended that it isn't banned by statute. In arecent letter to Bush administration officials, he said the1989 bailout law &quot;does not contain any language concerningthe purposes for which the {bailout} funds may be used.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
