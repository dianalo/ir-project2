Labor Secretary Lynn Martin told a news conference thather department would move ahead with a new, butlong-simmering, plan to push employers to remove cultural andother barriers to promotions for female and minorityexecutives.</RE><TEXT>   It appears likely that the effort will produce furthergovernment steps to remove or change barriers such ascorporate policies that reward white male managers forrecruiting other employees, who typically are also whitemales, without requiring special attempts to find women orminority candidates. It could also affect companies'mentoring practices in which executives mentor onlylower-level white men. Mrs. Martin didn't concentrate onregulatory enforcement as the main weapon, but she noted thedepartment would use a &quot;500-pound hammer,&quot; if necessary.   Mrs. Martin said her department would encourage voluntarymanagement efforts to remove the barriers, issue publicpraise for companies that do a good job of advancing femaleand minority executives, and conduct continued compliancereviews to ensure that federal contractors actively recruitand promote qualified women and minority workers and don'tdiscriminate against them.   The announcement culminated such reviews of nine largecompanies, which the department declined to name, although ithas signed affirmative-action agreements with some of themunder which the employers pledge to end practices that hamperadvancement of women or minorities.   The Labor Department plan was welcomed by the EqualEmployment Advisory Council, a large-employer group basedhere, for identifying specific management practices and theireffects, while offering a reasonable way to try to help solvethem.   For her part, Dee Soder, president of Endymion Co., a NewYork executive-advisory firm that counsels women managers andcorporate chief executives on how to lift the ceilings,called the plan &quot;an important initiative. Otherwise, peopleare less likely to take what they perceive as a risk&quot; inseeking to remove the glass ceiling.   Department officials stress that the plan fits well intothe Bush administration's stand on civil rights, whichopposes setting of formal quotas for hiring or promotion butemphasizes a person's qualifications instead. &quot;This is amirror reverse of quotas,&quot; Mrs. Martin said -- ensuring thattalented people move up the management ladder.   Various surveys have highlighted the relatively slightsuccess women have had in advancing into high managementjobs, and the even smaller success achieved by minorities. ALabor Department glass-ceiling report issued yesterday showedthat among 94 large employers analyzed by the department,women were 37% of 147,000 employees and minorities were 16%.   But only 17% of women and 6% of minorities held anymanagement job, and only 7% of women and 3% of minoritieswere at the executive level-assistant vice president orhigher. Minorities have plateaued at lower levels than women,the report said.   The attack on the glass ceiling was begun more than a yearago by then Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole but stalled asMrs. Martin pondered how and whether to carry out thedepartment's first regulatory venture into the executivesuite.   Mrs. Martin said she relied heavily on the compliancereviews to educate department officials on the complexitiesof how managers are promoted and what gets in the way. Mostof the nine reviewed companies have identified themselves inclosed meetings of the Equal Employment Advisory Council.Four of those who have been mentioned are PepsiCo Inc., TexasInstruments Inc., RJR Nabisco Inc. and Sterling Drug Inc., asubsidiary of Eastman Kodak Co.   None of the nine companies were cited for discriminationat the upper work-force levels but some &quot;did not live up tothe good faith efforts to meet all affirmative-actionrequirements&quot; under an executive order covering federalcontractors, the department report said.   Sterling Drug said that the company received a letter fromthe Labor Department in March 1990 saying it had found nodeficiencies or violations during its review. Similarly,Ronnie Miller Hasday, PepsiCo's vice president, corporatepersonnel, said: &quot;At the conclusion of the review we got aclean bill of health&quot; for glass ceiling issues. She addedthat department officials were &quot;very complimentary on some ofthe initiatives we have undertaken,&quot; including minorityinternship programs and expanded recruiting efforts.   Tamira Griffin, Texas Instruments' manager of equalopportunity employment, said the company &quot;has been aware ofthe glass ceiling and we want to dismantle it.&quot; She addedthat since several top managers have taken diversitytraining, &quot;we found that the managers were very receptive andwe plan to expand that program even more.&quot;   Officials of RJR Nabisco weren't available for comment.   The department report said it was almost never considereda corporate responsibility to monitor for equal opportunityfor women and minority managers moving up the ladder tosenior levels. It also listed such faults as poor recordkeeping, inadequately monitored executive appraisal andcompensation systems, and failure to offer career-enhancingassignments to women and minorities.   More companies are trying to find and correct impedimentsto the advancement of minority and women managers, thedepartment said, especially when chief executives getpersonally involved in the reshaping effort. Separately,Catalyst, a New York group that specializes inwomen-in-business issues, finds that the most criticalbarrier is &quot;management's aversion to taking risks with womenin line responsibility.&quot;   Catalyst names some employers that it says have come upwith commendable programs that help spur promotions for womenexecutives. These include American Airlines, AmericanTelephone andamp; Telegraph Co., Colgate-Palmolive Co., ConnecticutMutual Life Insurance Co., Du Pont Co., the Federal NationalMortgage Association, Honeywell Inc. and John Hancock MutualLife Insurance Co.   For its part, McDonnell Douglas Co. finished a study of 20companies outside the aerospace industry last fall, to seewhat works best in shattering the glass ceiling. Thoughofficials believe the company's own program surpasses theefforts of its aerospace competitors, top management hasaccepted the study's recommendations for doing better, saysDaryl Smith, manager of human resources planning. Theseinvolve having senior executives lead a program that willinclude mentoring efforts requiring each top manager to workwith two women or minority underlings, and putting highexecutives through managing-diversity training later thismonth.</TEXT></DOC>
