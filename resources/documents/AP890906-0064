LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A TWA airliner with 151 passengers dived toavoid colliding with a military plane at 37,000 feet, slightlyinjuring five people, authorities said.   Across the state, an Air Midwest commuter plane carrying sevenpassengers and two crewmen made a successful belly landing Tuesdaynight at Kansas City International Airport, officials said. Theplane skidded 1,000 feet but no one was injured.   TWA Flight 818, a Boeing 767 bound non-stop for Paris, took itsevasive action south of Lake Michigan Tuesday as it approachedDetroit, airline spokesman Don Morrison said.   Morrison said a Chicago air traffic controller's instructions putthe TWA jetliner on a collision course.   But a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration disputedMorrison's claim.   ``We have no knowledge of air traffic controllers beinginvolved,'' FAA spokesman Mort Edelstein said.   The FAA said it will review voice tapes and radar recordings todetermine circumstances surrounding Tuesday's incident.   A flight attendant and four passengers were hurt. Late Tuesday,all but one of the injured had been released from hospitals, wherethey were treated for bruises and minor cuts.   Flight 818 had been gone about 45 minutes following its afternoontakeoff from Lambert St. Louis International when its pilot cameinto contact with Chicago air controllers, Morrison said.   The pilot was given a vector change, a direction change, by theair traffic control system, Morrison said. ``He made that changeuntil (situated) at 37,000 feet, which was his assigned altitude,''Morrison said.   ``As he made the turn, he noted immediately in front of him anairplane _ a foreign aircraft. He immediately dropped altitude toavoid the aircraft. He avoided the aircraft, went underneath it,''Morrison said.   Edelstein said the incident involved the TWA plane and a militaryaircraft and was not being classified immediately as a nearcollision. The type of military plane was not immediately identified.   ``The last we knew, the planes were eight miles part,'' Edelsteinsaid. ``Why he took evasive action we won't know until we talk withthe pilot.''   Morrison said most of Flight 818's passengers were boarded otherflights to Paris.   In Kansas City, the landing gear of the Air Midwest commuterfailed to extend and lock in place properly, authorities said. Thetwin-engine turbo-prop Fairchild Metro skidded 1,000 feet on therunway before coming to a stop.   Authorities said foam was used on the runway to prevent fire incase of a fuel leak.</TEXT></DOC>
