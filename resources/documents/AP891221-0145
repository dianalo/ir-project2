The nation's military leaders were looking at Thursday's Day 2of ``Operation Just Cause'' as crucial in the battle for control ofthe Central American nation, said one high-level military official.   The fear is that unless Manuel Antonio Noriega's supporters arecaptured and disarmed, they could continue to threaten Panamaniancitizens and the lives of the 35,000 Americans living in thecountry, or at the very least offer a serious disruption to anyreturn to normalcy at the canal and elsewhere, officials said.   ``This is a key day because it will determine whether thePanamanian Defense Forces and the dignity battalions areconsolidating, or whether they remain as pockets of resistance thatcan be cut out and neutralized,'' said the highly placed officer,who spoke on condition he not be identified by name.   Asked how long he believed the strike force of thousands of U.S.troops will remain in the country, the official said, ``I don'tthink anybody here knows.''   Remarking that the forces were going house-to-house in theirefforts to clean out the remaining Noriega loyalists in Panama City_ and could be forced to search the countryside in search of thedeposed general _ the official said, ``It's not just a mop-upoperation anymore.''   Asked if U.S. military units might well be facing a protractedguerrilla battle in urban and country areas in their search forNoriega, the official answered, ``Yes. It very well may be.''   President Bush, asked at a session with reporters whether hebelieved the intervention would become a guerrilla operation, said,``I don't think so,'' adding that Noriega has been stripped of hiscommunications capabilities and the support of military forces thatwould allow him to mount an opposition in the countryside.   ``He hasn't been in a jungle in a long time. And it's toughliving, and he's been living high off the hog, off the Panamanianpeople. And so we don't expect'' a kind of mountain guerrillaorganization to arise reminiscent of that led by Cuba's FidelCastro in the 1950s, Bush said.   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, in a separate session withreporters, said that while major resistance from the Panamanianmilitary had ended, he could not ``rule out any possibility'' ofsuch things as terrorist attacks.   ``It's still a situation in which there is ongoing conflict andfirefights,'' said Cheney said, acknowledging the possibility ofindividual terrorist strikes and the taking of U.S. hostages.   ``Clearly, we haven't resolved all the potential situationswhere there may be Americans being held,'' Cheney said. ``We areaggressively working every one of those cases,'' he said incomments to a group of news service and newspaper reporters.   At a public briefing on Thursday, Pentagon spokesman PeteWilliams struck a positive note, saying that ``the organizedresistance ... has ceased at this point'' and that the ``objectiveof the day'' was to support the establishment of a democraticgovernment under the newly sworn and U.S.-supported president,Guillermo Endara.   Williams did acknowledge, however, that there was ``someconflict continuing'' with some members of the Noriega's ``dignitybattalions'' _ the his armed supporters in civil garb _ that remainin Panama City.   At the briefing, Army Gen. Tom Kelly, the joint staff's directorof operations, advised reporters that there was no time estimateavailable for when the increased U.S. forces might withdraw.   ``We don't have a time line,'' Kelly said. ``They will be thereuntil the job is done.''   Rear Adm. Ted Sheafer, who also briefed reporters, said U.S.military officials still think Noriega is inside Panamanian borders.   ``We believe he is in the country,'' Sheafer said.   On Capitol Hill, Sen. Robert Kasten, R-Wis., expressed concernover a long-term engagement.   ``If there is a beginning, middle and end to American militaryinvolvement it is far better than having this thing dragging outover weeks and months,'' Kasten said.   Another senior Pentagon official, who also spoke privately, saidhe was confident that the specialized U.S. military units onNoriega's trail will ultimately be successful.   ``It may take some time,'' he said, ``But they'll get him.''   ``Noriega is noisy, blustery, and has such a big ego that it isnearly impossible for him to travel incognito,'' the official said.   The official said that the U.S. intervention force will be ableto sustain itself easily over the long term, if a lengthy presenceis necessary, because of the well-organized U.S. base of operationsthat has been in place for decades in Panama.</TEXT></DOC>
