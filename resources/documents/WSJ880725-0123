But poring over information is a big step from making a bid, and an even bigger step from making an aggressive bid. In such auctions, many oil companies enter data rooms simply to obtain confidential information on a competitor that they wouldn't otherwise have access to, according to consultants who have walked company representatives through data rooms in the past for just that purpose.    In addition, sellers haven't been getting the extremely high prices that were paid for properties earlier this year. Just last week, Enron Corp. said it pulled its exploration and production unit off the block because it couldn't get a satisfactory bid.    The Tenneco sale, expected to reap $5 billion to $7 billion, may have hurt Enron's auction by flooding a market in which there already were a large number of properties for sale.    Enron tried to sell its unit in one big piece, but Tenneco devised a different strategy. It confirmed that it has broken up its properties into eight geographic packages: the Gulf of Mexico; onshore along the Gulf Coast; mid-continent North America, including the Hugoton area; the Rocky Mountain region, which includes the gas-rich San Juan Basin in New Mexico; the Pacific Coast; the North Sea; Colombia; and a potpourri of other international holdings.    &quot;As long as they're going to sell it piecemeal, there's going to be a lot of value added,&quot; said Kerry Thornhill-Cummings, vice president of the investment banking firm Strevig andamp; Associates Inc., Houston. &quot;People will pay a premium to be in a certain area, especially if they're already there.&quot;    The Shell Oil Co. unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group and Chevron Corp., for example, could be interested in adding to their California properties. Occidental Petroleum Corp. may be interested in expanding in Colombia. Pennzoil Co., Shell, Amoco Corp., Exxon Corp., Mobil Corp., Chevron, the Conoco Inc. unit of Du Pont Co., Elf Aquitaine Petroleum and a number of others would like to add to their Gulf of Mexico holdings. Most major companies hold properties in the same domestic onshore areas as Tenneco.    Tenneco scattered its data rooms across the country, and put them near the properties themselves, in such cities as Lafayette, La., Bakersfield, Calif., Houston and Denver.    The number of companies that could buy all eight packages is extremely limited, because of the price and disparity of the assets. Rumors, nonetheless, have been rampant. Several weeks ago, word spread through Tenneco's downtown headquarters that Exxon was going to buy all the properties, plus Tenneco's pipeline unit. But Tenneco maintains that its pipeline business isn't for sale. And an industry source said &quot;anybody who's involved&quot; has agreed not to make such a preemptive strike.    Tenneco initially hoped to sell the properties by the end of the year, but now says that data rooms are scheduled to close the last week of August, with bids due around the end of the third quarter.    Expectations that industry giants will be the dominant bidders have scared off some potential buyers. One aggressive property acquirer, Freeport-McMoRan Inc., won't bother wasting the roughly $20 million it would cost to evaluate the data and make a bid. &quot;We can't compete with companies those sizes,&quot; Chairman James R. Moffett said.    Even some bigger companies caution that they are leery of paying too big a premium. &quot;We're going to be bidders,&quot; said a top official of a major oil company. &quot;But if the winning bids are as high as they were in some deals earlier this year, then we're not going to be winning bidders.&quot;    The Gulf of Mexico package is the prize of the auction. Last year, that area accounted for a quarter of the company's oil production and two-thirds of its gas output. It also has a lot of undeveloped potential. The Gulf is &quot;the place where the company has carved out a really first-rate role,&quot; an industry official said.    It isn't clear if a bidder would be interested in Tenneco's personnel or just its properties. The company's record as an inexpensive oil finder and developer is excellent, and Tenneco has continued to be active since the auction was announced in late May. The head of Tenneco's oil company unit, Joe B. Foster, previously said he planned to resign from Tenneco once the auction was completed. It is believed that Mr. Foster is trying to put together an investor group to make a bid, but he declined to comment.    Tenneco will also open data rooms today for its &quot;downstream&quot; operations, which have been broken up into packages, including a modern refinery and roughly 450 service stations. Some industry officials say the stations are a less attractive package because they are spread across so many states. </TEXT></DOC>
