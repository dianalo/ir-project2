 Instead, the computerrevolution has proved to be a bonanza for paper and filecabinetmanufacturers.andM;In hindsights, it's easy to understand why the computer has been a netgenerator of paper.andP;  Paper is a marvelous way to present information: It'scheap, easy to carry and requires no special equipment.andP;  In small amounts,storing paper is a simple and relatively painless process.andM;For large paper-intensive businesses such as the insurance industry, however,paper documents have long been viewed as a plague.andP;  Document-processingsystems costing hundreds of thousands of dollars have been eagerly purchasedby these businesses to electronically scan documents into files that can bestored on a disk.andM;While less paper-intensive types of companies are also recognizing the needto replace paper filing systems with crossindexed, electronically-storedimages of original documents, these firms are seeking less expensive systemsto accomplish this task.andM;With the growing power of desktop PCs, the availability of relativelyinexpensive scanners and the growing prevalence of LANs with laser printersattached, PC LAN-based document-storage systems are springing up across thelandscape.andM;While visions of offices and corporations operating entirely without papermay be enticing, the more prosaic reality appears to be document-processingsystems being used as a simple filing systems--in short, to turn a roomful offile cabinets into a handful of laser disks.andM;In this review, PC Week looks at three software products that let buyersintegrate scanners, laser disks, laser printers and LANs into adocument-storage and retrieval system for PCs that run DOS and Windows.andO;These three products--Courtland Group Inc.'s Alexsys EZ/LAN, DeerfieldSystems' Docu Vision and ImageTech Inc.'s Marvin--let users capture, file andretrieve source-document images and electronic data on DOS PCs withoutrequiring that users or installers become programmers.andM;These programs represent just one of the approaches in this burgeoningcategory of PC-based document-storage and retrieval systems.andP;  Unlike thethree programs in this review, some products are closely tied to a singlemanufacturer's hardware.andP;  Other products require a specialized Unix or OS/2server, or are designed for applications developers rather than for theaverage user.andM;Document processing on the PC is still a new industry, and many of thesecompanies have been and currently are engaged in extensive upgrades of theirsoftware.andM;Courtland chose to submit it more basic Alexsys EZ/LAN product for reviewinstead of its more sophisticated offering, Alexsys, because the company isfinishing work on two new versions of Alexsys that will represent incrementalexpansions of the features currently offered in the Alexsys EZ/LAN, companyofficials said.andM;Deerfield Systems just finished adding many new features to Docu Vision.andM;Marvin will be available as a Windows 3.0 release this month, according toofficials from ImageTech Inc.andM;PC Week tested these three products by installing them on a Compaq Deskpro386/20 with a VGA monitor adapter and 6M bytes of RAM.andP;  The products weretested with a Fujitsu 3093 ImageScanner using Kofax Image Products Inc.'sKF-8204 Document Processor Board (see story, Page 97).andM;Any of these three packages can provide the glue that ties together amultiuser document-filing system on a LAN using image scanners, opticaldrives and laser printers.andM;DocuVision has the most sophisticated applications-development features ofthe three, allowing a complex data-management system to be built around thefiled images, with some extra effort on the part of the user.andM;Alexsys EZ/LAN allows for quick installation of a document-filing system atthe lowest initial price, and it provides an upgrade path to a more powerfulsystem at a later date.andM;Marvin benefits from being a Windows application with a very good databasecapability and applications-development tools.andP;  The upcoming Windows 3.0version of Marvin should particularly inspire a lot of interest.andM;System IntegrationandM;Is Not a ProjectandM;For Faint of HeartandM;PC document-storage systems are fraught with potential pitfalls for theintegrator or installer.andM;There is no standard interface specification for image scanners, and theworld of laser printers is only slightly more rational due to Hewlett-PackardCo.'s dominance.andM;The scanned black-and-white image of an 8 1/2-by-11-inch sheet of paperbecomes a megabyte of data at 300 dots per inc, but most of that image isblank space, which lends itself well to compression.andM;Typically, a 1M-byte image of a page of text can be compressed down to 25K to50K bytes.andP;  This file must then be decompressed for viewing on the screen orfor printing.andM;The chore of compression and decompression is CPU cycle-intensive and canreally bog down a PC.andP;  To be printed, a file must be decompressed and sent tothe printer as quickly as possible.andP;  Relying on a Pc's CPU for decompression,then waiting for a 1M-byte graphics file to go to a laser printer fortransformation into a printed page, is a painfully slow process that needs tobe accelerated to make these graphics systems usable.andM;Interface to Scanners, PrintersandM;Each of the reviewed software products must have its own interface toscanners and printers.andP;  One common denominator for all the products is theKofax Image Products Inc.'s KF-8204 Document Processor Board, which can beused to provide hardware compression and control the interface to at least 18scanners.andM;For laser-printer, control, Kofax and LaserMaster Corp.'s graphics-interfaceboards can be used to speed up printing on many laser printers.andP;  Theseproducts require the installation of one board in the Pc and another in thelaser printer's video I/O slot.andP;  This slot is available on many laserprinters, such as engine-equipped printers from Hewlett-Packard, Canon U.S.A.andO;Inc. and Ricoh Corp.andP;  The video I/O slot allows the card to share the printerengine with the existing printer controller.andM;All of the tested products work with Kofax 820X cards.andP;  Kofax will soonrelease a new version, the 9100 and 9200 series cards, which will provideimage rotation, scale-to-print and other functions.andM;Until recently, each of these vendors had to develop special drivers foroptical disks, but now most of them recommend that buyers use third-partysoftware such as Corel Systems Corp.'s optical-disk interface software.andM;Care must be taken to get the right scanners, interface cards, optical disks(and possibly optical-disk jukeboxes), laser printers, fax cards, a LAN,cables and software together and working at one time.andM;In fact, paying a VAR or integrator who has survived a few priorinstallations of these products may be a wise investment for all but the mostbattlescarred veterans.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
