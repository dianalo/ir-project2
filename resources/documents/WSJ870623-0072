Continental added that the move, which follows similar announcements by a growing number of banking concerns, will result in a second-quarter loss of about $470 million and a 1987 loss of about $300 million.    The reserve is now equal to about 29% of Continental's loans to troubled debtor countries -- a higher ratio than the 25% Citicorp took when it started the recent series of reserves increases, but lower than some others, including the 30% First Chicago Corp. took last week.    William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which bailed out Continental and took on most of its worst loans, said he was pleased with Continental's decision. &quot;It's the right thing to do,&quot; he said, adding that the FDIC didn't press Continental to make the move.    With the addition to reserves, Continental's total reserves for loan losses will be $970 million, or 5% of total loans. The company already had $460 million set aside for troubled foreign borrowers.    Like other banks, Continental said it hopes to convert much of its Latin American loan portfolio into equity investments in those countries. &quot;I don't know what the timing will be,&quot; a spokesman said.    The company's primary capital, which includes stockholders' equity, some forms of debt and the loan-loss reserve, will remain at about 7.6% of assets.    Separately, the company said it will restate earnings for the years 1983 through 1986 because of a review by management of a 1983 real-estate transaction. A spokesman said the transaction, which resulted in a $12 million after-tax gain, shouldn't have been recorded as a completed sale. As a result, net income will be reduced about $12 million for 1983, $10 million for 1984 and $1 million for 1985 and 1986. </TEXT></DOC>
