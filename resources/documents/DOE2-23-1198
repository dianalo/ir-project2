<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-23-1198 </DOCNO><TEXT>Measurements of an apparent magnetic-field-dependent absorption (imaginarypart of the a.c. magnetic susceptibility) in superconducting Y1Ba{sub2}Cu{sub 3}O{sub 7} ceramics and crystals are reported. The absorption,which is observed over a wide range of frequencies but only when thematerial is below the superconducting transition temperature, is characterizedby a narrow (about 30 Gauss FWHM at 6 MHz) peak and a wide (greater than10 kG) feature, both of which are maximum at zero magnetic field. Theabsorption strength varies approximately as one over the square rootof the frequency. The unusual magnetic-field-dependent peaks in the magneticsusceptibility are inherent in single grains and therefore do not originatefrom intergrain Josephson currents or multigrain (i.e., percolative)loops. The susceptibility peaks must be due to bulk behavior, interactionsat grain surfaces, intragrain current loops, or intragrain Josephsonjunctions. 9 references.</TEXT></DOC>
