You'll findinsulated pipe wrap at most hardware, home center and many discount stores.Good quality, thick wall, closed cell foam insulation tubes are available fromsome large hardware stores and most plumbing supply companies.; (hbox);    Ifyou'll be attending the California Home Show this weekend at the San JoseConvention Center or the Orchard Supply Hardware How-To Fair Feb. 1-3, thereare a few things you might want to take along with you.;    First, measure anyrooms that you are interested in redecorating or remodeling and jot down thedimensions on a rough layout of the room (noting door and window placement).Don't forget to measure door openings and the sizes of any large pieces offurniture that you know you'll keep. If you're thinking about organizing acloset or garage, you'll need to measure those areas as well.;    If you'reinterested in repainting, siding, a new roof, or gutters, you'll need to knowthe measurements on the perimeter of the house. If you're interested infencing or landscaping, measure your yard and sketch an exterior layout.;   Take with you swatches of fabrics, wallpaper or carpeting, as well as anypaint chips you have for easy reference in color matching. Also, carry ameasuring tape, pencil and pad.;    Don't be hurried into a purchase. Look,ask questions, make notes, collect business cards, and even make appointmentsfor contractors or suppliers to visit your home.;    Remember that any workcosting more than $300 requires a contractor's license.

What's a &quot;dedicated electrical circuit?&quot;; A It's a circuitthat goes directly from the main electrical service panel to one and only onereceptacle. So that nothing else is plugged into the outlet, a singlereceptacle is used instead of a common double outlet.; Q I've been told thatit's not a good idea to paint during the winter, supposedly because of theincreased moisture in the air. Is it OK to apply latex wall paint at this timeof year?; A If moisture content kept people from painting there are areas ofthe East Coast and South that would never get painted. Humidity will affectdrying time but not the quality or finish of the paint. Paint away.; Q When Ipush against one section of the sheetrock in my bathroom, it gives. It feelsas if it's moving a 1/4 inch or so. It isn't cracked or damaged, but should Ido anything about the movement.; A Yes. Stop pushing on it. Wall studs areoften put in place while the wood has a fairly high moisture content. As thestuds dry they shrink and can even twist and warp. I'm guessing that this iswhat's happened in your situation. Screwing or nailing the sheetrock to a studcould put enough stress on it to crack it. I'd leave well enough alone.; QThere are so many different fluorescent light tubes available that I'mconfused over what's the best one to use above a workbench. I'm not at theworkbench more than a few hours a week, but I'd still like the best light.; AAccording to Les Brooks of General Electric's lighting division in Cleveland,&quot;any inexpensive cool white&quot; tube will probably work well for you.
