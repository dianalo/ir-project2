U.S. Customs Service surveillance planes watched the drop off thenorthern coast of Cuba late Friday night, the same day Cubaannounced four military officers were sentenced to death for drugtrafficking.   ``This shows the pattern is still continuing,'' said PatrickO'Brien, U.S. Customs special agent-in-charge for South Florida.``The crackdown in Cuba has done little to stop the flow of drugs.''   Customs followed the suspected drug plane over Cuban waters andwatched it drop 18 bales to a waiting speedboat, O'Brien said.   ``Two MiG fighters came on to the scene and protected the Cubanairspace,'' O'Brien said. ``We had to get out of there, but beforewe left we got a good look at the plane and the boat below.''   Saturday morning, an abandoned 37-foot speedboat with bales ofcocaine floating nearby were found in Biscayne Bay, 20 miles southof Miami. The 1,584 pounds of cocaine was valued at about $10million, O'Brien said.   O'Brien said the seizure is significant because it follows aCuban crackdown on drugs that has reached the highest levels of thecommunist island nation's government.   Cuban radio announced Friday that former Maj. Gen. Arnaldo Ochoaand three other military officers were sentenced to death for aconspiracy to smuggle cocaine from Colombia's Medellin Cartelthrough Cuban to the United States.   Saturday's seizure followed one of the nation's largest cocainefinds aboard a Panamanian freighter intercepted off Key West. Thefreighter, bound for the Dominican Republic and boarded by Customsagents Thursday, had 3,359 pounds of cocaine, officials said.</TEXT></DOC>
