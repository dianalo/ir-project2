Angrist (WSJ Special) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> CMD SCR MIN PCS </IN><TEXT>   Futures traders need all the help they can get, and they pay through the nose for it.    About 90% of all individual commodity speculators lose money, numerous studies have shown. Brokerage houses shamelessly confess that the average lifetime of an individual futures account is less than a year. Individual speculators quickly learn that there is no easy money in the futures markets.    That is why most traders seek help with their trading. They subscribe to newsletters and to hot lines that provide nightly advice by phone. And they buy lots of trading systems, which are mathematical, usually computerized routines that are applied to prices to indicate when traders should buy or sell futures contracts.    Nobody knows for sure how big the trading-system business is, but John Hill, publisher of a newsletter that provides independent evaluation of systems, estimates sales at several million dollars annually. Many systems sell for $3,000 apiece. (Numerous stock trading systems also are for sale.)    &quot;Everybody is always looking for the Holy Grail -- but, of course, there isn't one,&quot; says Terry Apple, a vice president at Cale Futures, a McLean, Va., commodity money manager. He says it is common for investors to work with a system they have bought for a couple of weeks, maybe even trade it a while and take a few losses. &quot;Then, boom, they put it up and purchase the next sure-fire trading system,&quot; he says.    Ann Nagy, a broker with Merrill Lynch in Cleveland who describes herself as a system junkie, says, &quot;I have bought a lot of systems and mostly they are unimpressive.&quot; Three years ago, she bought a system for $2,000, put it on her computer and ran it all night. &quot;It produced reams of printouts, and the results were spectacular,&quot; she says. &quot;But in the real market where prices were not trending (neither rising nor falling on a consistent basis), the losses were humongous.&quot;    The sellers of futures-trading systems invariably cite impressive track records, but investors are advised to be skeptical. As John Murphy, a trading consultant and author of a respected text on technical trading, puts it: &quot;If I had developed a truly successful trading system, why would I sell it? Instead, I would sell my house and trade (with the system) for myself.&quot;    It is easy to develop a computerized system that performs like a whiz using price data from last month or last year. &quot;The system designer has used so much past information that a successful outcome (for the past) is a foregone conclusion,&quot; says Jack Schwager, director of futures research at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. But fitting a system to trading that already occurred doesn't necessarily translate into a successful system for trading yet to come, he says.    System designers are quick to point out that all they have to work with is past price data. But Mr. Schwager says the past data used in developing the systems shouldn't be the same data used for testing.    Mr. Apple at Cale Futures has been using three systems to trade with real money and says systems can be a big help. &quot;I have used ProfitTaker for three and a half years, and it has done very well,&quot; he says. &quot;It is up 60% since the beginning of the year.&quot;    But finding a good system and sticking with it isn't easy. Bo Thunman, in fact, started a newsletter, Club 3000 News, in 1982 for people who had spent at least $3,000 on a trading system and were disappointed with it. Subscribers, now numbering 930, use the newsletter to exchange ideas on trading systems or any subject related to futures.    Mr. Thunman's advice to traders looking for a system: &quot;Buy the best they can find. Then study it for weeks or months, seeing how it performs in all types of markets. And then, and only then, go into the market and trade it.&quot;    Learning how systems perform can be expensive if done in the market. That is why many traders turn to Mr. Hill's newsletter, Futures Truth. Each month, he runs performance tests on more than 50 different systems. He shows results for periods in which systems could have been fitted to past data and also results for the most recent 12 months.    The accompanying table summarizes Mr. Hill's tests of some of the best- and worst-performing systems. The net profit or loss for the 12 months ended Sept. 30 is after subtracting discount brokerage commissions and allowing for not getting the best prices in buying and selling.    The maximum drawdown is the largest amount of a trader's capital the trading system lost during the course of the year. Specifically, it is the difference between the highest and lowest balances in a trading account devoted solely to executing the trading system's signals. The higher the drawdown, the less effective the system.    The percentage of profitable trades is shown, but space didn't allow including the total number of trades. Those figures ranged widely, from fewer than than a dozen to 96.    The last column shows the return on the trading capital put into the trading system. The capital consists of two elements. The first is the margin, or good-faith money, required to trade one contract; for the test, this was assumed to be $3,000, except for the Sandamp;P contract, which was assumed to be $18,000. The second is the maximum drawdown.    Looking ahead to futures markets this week:   Copper   Copper traders, disillusioned by the lackluster correction last week after a prolonged run-up, became aggressive buyers Friday. Futures prices soared to life-of-contract highs.    The November delivery rose 9.95 cents to $1.4445 a pound; at one point, it traded as high as $1.448. The very active December contract advanced 7.05 cents to $1.397, after trading as high as $1.398.    Strong demand, low global inventories and continued production problems outside the U.S. continue to influence the market. Copper users are getting ready to buy metal for their needs in the first half of 1989, an analyst said.    Fred Demler, metals economist for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., New York, noted that copper rallies in 1974, 1980 and 1987 were followed by sharp corrections. &quot;This market hasn't done so, and instead shows signs of moving even higher,&quot; he said. &quot;Considering all the factors, it looks like copper prices are going to get stronger before they soften.&quot;    Reports of Japanese buying of copper contributed to Friday's rally, analysts said.    Illustrating the production problems, Mr. Demler said that Peruvian production through August was down 17%; Chilean output was off 1%; and combined production in Zambia and Zaire is off more than 15%. At the same time, he said, global demand in the form of deliveries has risen 2%, and producer stocks outside the U.S. at the end of August fell 25,000 metric tons from July to 219,700 metric tons.    Precious Metals   Precious metals prices rose sharply Friday, responding to Middle East tensions for the first time in recent memory. Reports circulated that Syria was massing troops along the northern Lebanese border.    December gold rose $4.80 an ounce to $414.90. December silver advanced 8.7 cents an ounce to $6.335. January platinum was up $11.70 at $543.80.    Analysts said prices began rising strongly early in the session, seemingly without any new developments. The buying pressure encountered little selling, helping prices rise fast. Then the Syrian report became known, and prices advanced to their highs of the day, but fell a bit by the close.    Bernard Savaiko, senior metals analyst for PaineWebber Inc., New York, said that the market had made most of its move before the Syrian report became known, and that the boost in prices might have been a delayed reaction to the weeklong softness in the U.S. dollar.    &quot;Gold ignored the dollar through the week, for the most part, and apparently made up for it&quot; on Friday, he said.    Analysts said reports circulated that the Soviet Union had denied it had increased its sales of gold, as had been rumored during the week. Reports that Japan and Taiwan had been attracted by current levels to buy more gold was also a supporting factor, analysts said.    ---           How Selected Trading Systems Performed   This performance information is abridged from test results for the 12 months ended Sept. 30. Some systems are capable of trading more than one commodity, and might trade some well while producing nothing but losses for others.
