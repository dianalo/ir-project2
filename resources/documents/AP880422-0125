Curfews remained in effect today in 22 refugee camps and citiesin the occupied territories, affecting some 400,000 Palestinianresidents.   The army also barred Arab residents of the territories fromentering Israel for a third straight day to try to curb violence onthe Moslem Sabbath.

In Lebanon, Israeli warplanes raided Palestinian guerrilla basessouth of Beirut today, Lebanese police and the Israeli armyreported.   The police said the main targets of the attack were guerrillabases near the town of Barja in the Kharroub region, 15 miles southof the Lebanese capital.   Police said they had no immediate reports of casualties.   The army said its planes returned safely to base.   At least 48 people have been killed and 63 wounded in the fiveprevious Israeli raids since Jan. 3.   The army also said today that Israeli troops and Israeli-alliedmilitiamen killed six guerrillas in two clashes in southern LebanonWednesday. One militiaman was killed.   About 200 Palestinian youths emerged from noon prayers at the AlOmari mosque in Gaza City, throwing rocks at Israeli troops, Arabwitnesses said.   ``Youths gather, gather because Abu Jihad sacrificed hisblood,'' they chanted.   The Palestinians were protesting the killing of PLO militarycommander Khalil al-Wazir, known as Abu Jihad, who was gunned downat his home in Tunis, Tunisia, Saturday last week.   A Tunisian government report blames Israel for killing Wazir,who grew up in Gaza. Israeli sources also have confirmed Israelcarried out the assassination.   Troops hurled tear gas canisters and fired live ammunition intothe air to disperse the crowd.   In the nearby Jabaliya refugee camp in Gaza, troops opened fireon rock-throwing Arab protesters outside a mosque after noonprayers, Arab witnesses said.   Hospital officials said 10 Palestinians were wounded, includinga 9-year-old boy struck in the left hip and right arm.   The army said it was checking the report.   On the Temple Mount about 10,000 Palestinians attended servicesat the Al Aqsa and Dome of the Rock mosques, where the prayerleader urged the crowd to persist in protests against the Israelis.   After services, hundreds of worshipers carrying black banners ofmourning and outlawed Palestinian flags hurled rocks at a policestation outside the mosques. Israel radio and witnesses said thepolice fired rubber bullets, hitting six Arabs and five officerswere injured.   ``With our spirit and our blood, we will avenge Abu Jihad,''shouted some of the protesters.   The clash on Temple Mount, known in Arabic as Harim es-Sharif,or Noble Enclosure, was the most serious since Jan. 15 when riotpolice fired tear gas on the compound. In that incident, 80 to 100Palestinians were treated for the effects of tear gas, and onepolice officer was knifed.   According to PLO orders contained in an underground leaflet,today and Sunday were set aside as days of prayer for Abu Jihad,and Saturday is to be a ``Day of Rage.''   The leaflets bearing Wazir's picture ordered Palestinians tostep up attacks with ``stones, petrol bombs, metal balls andslingshots'' to avenge the PLO leader's death.   Since the Dec. 8 start of the anti-occupation protests, 169Palestinians and two Israelis have been killed. Today's death wasnot included in the toll.</TEXT></DOC>
