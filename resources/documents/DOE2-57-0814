Thediverted flux is expected to emerge predominantly on the inside of thetorus when a vertical magnetic field which shifts the magnetic surfacestowards the inside is applied, and vice versa. The prediction has beenverified using probe arrays located in the divertor regions. In additionto the redistribution of diverted particle flux, the distance a fieldline travels from the separatrix until it reaches the wall has been predictedto increase for each of the magnetically altered cases. The formationof magnetic island chains beyond the separatrix has been found to beresponsible for the increase. (author). Letter-to-the-editor. 10 refs,7 figs, 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
