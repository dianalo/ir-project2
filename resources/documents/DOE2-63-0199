This review extends earlieraudit work at a second Department contractor, Rockwell International,Rocky Flats Plant, Engineering Prototype Group, on which we issued areport dated July 12, 1988. That audit focused on the Prototype Group'sproviding Livermore with illustrations, models, engineering prototypes,and other articles (mementos, plaques, etc.) during October 1977 throughSeptember 1985. Issues arose during that audit which required a separatereview at SAN and Livermore, to determine specifically: the proprietyof, and SAN oversight of, procurement practices followed by Livermore;the basis for the Livermore orders; the adequacy of reimbursement tothe Department for silver used in medallions; and the cost ceilings formemorabilia contained in the Department's contract with the Universityof California, which operates Livermore for the Department. Limitingthe audit scope to the orders Livermore placed with Rockwell's PrototypeGroup, we reviewed Department and Livermore procedures for acquiringmemorabilia. In addition to interviewing SAN and Livermore Legal Counsel,Special Material Office personnel, and Research and Development Programrepresentatives, we examined SMO requisitions, accounts payable listingsand related payments, and selected research and development correspondences.</TEXT></DOC>
