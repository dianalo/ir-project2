Meeting in Saudi Arabia, the five Persian Gulf members ofOPEC said in a statement that the recent erosion of oilprices necessitated a &quot;strict, practical and immediatecommitment by all OPEC members to the production ceiling setout in the November 1989 accord, which is to be maintaineduntil prices rise to an acceptable level.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Some oil analysts promptly labeled the statement a&quot;blueprint&quot; for the midyear OPEC conference beginning July 25in Geneva. The statement also affected oil and stock markets.Oil prices rose again, and prices of oil company sharesincreased in trading on U.S. markets.   The November agreement called for a production ceiling of22.1 million barrels a day. But largely because ofoverproduction by Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, actualoutput is running at least a million barrels a day more thanthat. This has contributed to a world oil glut and helpeddepress petroleum prices by one-third.   Ministers from Kuwait and the United Arab Emiratesparticipated in the meeting along with their counterpartsfrom Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Qatar. Without being morespecific, the joint statement suggested Kuwait and the UnitedArab Emirates would cooperate with OPEC output curbs.   Although oil analysts credited some other factors besidesthe Saudi meeting, prices of North Sea crudes reacted to thenews, rising 15 cents to 30 cents a barrel in European spotmarkets. In heavy U.S. futures trading, crude oil for Augustdelivery closed higher for the third straight day, rising 53cents a barrel to settle at $17.47. For the second day in arow, several U.S. refiners increased field postings for WestTexas Intermediate crude by 50 cents a barrel.   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Unocal Corp.was particulary active among oil issues, rising $1.50 to$27.75 on a volume of 1.6 million shares. Other advancingissues included Exxon Corp., Chevron Corp., Texaco Inc.,Mobil Corp. and Amoco Corp. Among oil field-servicesconcerns, Baker Hughes Inc., Schlumberger Ltd., HalliburtonCo. and Rowan Cos. all posted gains.   The meeting of the five ministers followed a pattern. ThePersian Gulf group, holding most of the world's spareoil-producing capacity, usually gets together just before anOPEC conference. But oil economists saw this meeting as beingparticularly significant, with President Saddam Hussein ofIraq and King Fahd of Saudi Arabia clearly taking a strongerhand in OPEC affairs.   &quot;In my mind, the real OPEC meeting just concluded,&quot; saidBryan Jacoboski, senior oil analyst at PaineWebber Inc.   Whatever influence the group of five may have on the eightother OPEC members, industry officials saw nothingcontroversial in the proposals. &quot;This is a very positivedevelopment,&quot; said a senior OPEC delegate from a countryoutside the Persian Gulf.   Most of OPEC's 13 members, except for Kuwait and theUnited Arab Emirates, have kept higher petroleum pricesrather than expanded production as their top priority allalong. That is because many are already producing atcapacity, and the price declines this year have cut deeplyinto their revenues. Yesterday, for example, Iraq officiallyendorsed a proposal by Iran to cooperate with its formerenemy in pressing for an oil price of $25 a barrel.   &quot;For the first time now, all of them are singing the samesong,&quot; said Antonio M. Szabo, president of the managementscience division of Bonner andamp; Moore Consultants.   It wasn't immediately clear how the other Persian Gulfcountries would handle the situation with the United ArabEmirates, which refuses to accept its OPEC quota of 1.1million barrels a day. But there were hints that others couldreduce their quotas slightly to give more leeway to theUnited Arab Emirates or raise the ceiling, if necessary.   Oil analysts speculated that if the ceiling were raised by400,000 barrels a day, to 22.5 million, the United ArabEmirates would have a quota of 1.5 million barrels a day andparity with Kuwait. The analysts suggested that in return theUnited Arab Emirates would trim its actual output from twomillion barrels a day to 1.8 million. Kuwait also wouldreduce its production from the current 1.7 million. Thatwould mean total OPEC output could drop below 23 million.   The statement from the ministers wasn't specific on thismatter, but it did say that the &quot;forthcoming ministerialmeeting should not increase the current OPEC ceiling unless afigure can be agreed that involves all 13 members, includingthe United Arab Emirates.&quot; Also, the statement said, &quot;a studywas undertaken to guarantee the UAE's return to the agreementand {to ensure} that it abides by what it is allocated. It ishoped that this issue will be resolved during the next fewdays.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
