 the Romans established the office of the censor, a magistratewho not only registered the citizens of Rome and their property for taxationbut also regulated their morals.andP;  The term censorship in English goes back tothe regulatory function of the censor's office.andM;Today the U.S.andP;  Congress takes the census of the nation, taxes its citizensand, through the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, regulates the ethicalbehavior of federal government employees.andM;Judging by recent events that have made writing about ethics a cottageindustry in Washington, the ethics act has not accomplished its purpose andis badly in need of reform.andM;President Bush, shortly after taking office, established a Commission onFederal Ethics Law Reform and instructed it to develop &quot;an unambiguous code-- a code of conduct -- to ensure that those who serve the public trust avoidany actual or apparent conflict between their personal or public interests.&quot;andM;By prohibiting apparent conflicts of interest as well as actual conflicts,Bush created a dilemma for the members of the commission as they tried todevelop an unambiguous code of conduct.andM;Dealing with this issue required that they answer two key questions: How isthe public's interest served by banning apparent conflicts of interest that,by definition, are not real conflicts of interest, and does the prohibitionof apparent conflicts of interest truly contribute to a less ambiguous codeof conduct?andM;The commission chose not to resolve the dilemma.andP;  To understand why it shouldhave, let's look at a pair of examples.andM;The first is the case of a relatively junior staff person involved inanalyzing telecommunications policy matters.andP;  His mother had given one shareof ATandamp;T Co. stock to each of his two young children.andP;  He was deemed by theagency ethics officer to have a conflict of interest.andP;  His children were todivest themselves of the stock or he was to find another position.andM;The second case is better known; it is that of James Baker, now secretary ofState.andP;  While secretary of the Treasury, he owned shares in a bank that was amajor holder of Third World debt.andP;  An associate explained that Baker probablydid so for &quot;sentimental reasons.&quot;andP;  His grandfather had started a bank thathad merged with the bank whose shares he now held, and he wanted to pass theholdings on to his children.andM;In both cases there was an apparent conflict of interest; in only one wasthere clearly an actual conflict of interest.andP;  Incidentally, by one account,Baker's continued involvement in policy matters affecting banks &quot;was in linewith precedents within Treasury&quot; and was sanctioned by senior ethicsofficials.andM;Differing JudgmentsandM;There also are many individual cases involving apparent conflicts of interestin which one ethics officer came down on one side of the fence and a secondcame down on the other.andM;The president's commission recognized at least one such class of situationswhen it recommended that the Office of Government Ethics be authorized towaive reporting the underlying assets of widely diversified mutual andpension funds where the application of the apparent-conflict-of-in-terestrule made no practical sense.andM;The commission, however, chose not to resolve the general issue even afterJudge Griffin Bell, a member of the commission, called a &quot;political act&quot; theexecutive order issued by President Johnson originally prohibiting theappearance of conflicts of interest.andP;  Presumably, Johnson intended to doCongress one better.andM;That, and giving agency ethics officers a cop-out from deciding whether areal conflict of interest exists, seems to be the only purposes served bybanning apparent conflicts.andP;  On the other hand, there are at least three goodreasons for eliminating this rule.andM;First, as these examples illustrate, it is ineffective.andP;  Prohibiting theappearance of conflicts of interests only creates the illusion of tightethical standards.andP;  According to Griffin Bell, &quot;we ought to just eliminateit.andP;  You're either in a conflict or you're not in a conflict.&quot;andM;The real test ought to be: Are you in a position where you can either make orinfluence decisions that can change measurably the value of a financialholding that you have?andM;The argument has been raised often in defense of an individual that it was&quot;apparent&quot; that he had no conflict of interest because he had made decisionsthat adversely affected his holdings.andP;  That statement proves only that he didindeed have an actual conflict of interest.andM;Second, the rule is inefficient.andP;  It chews up lots of resources that could beused more effectively to achieve the same end through other means.andP;  It wouldbe refreshing to see public interest groups that are appalled at governmentwaste concern themselves with the wastefulness of practices such as this onethat they support.andM;Much of what is decried as bureaucratic behavior originates withwell-intentioned advocacy.andM;Third, it is dysfunctional -- a fancy word for saying it does things youdon't want it to do.andP;  Richard Cohen, in a column in the Washington Post,called this phenomenon &quot;the vice of virtue.&quot;andP;  He wrote, &quot;We seek the virtuousperson for government, but our standards are so rigid we will wind up withsomething else entirely: the hypocrite.&quot;andM;Senior government officials have no choice but to carry out the executiveorder implementing the Ethics in Government Act, irrespective of itsfailings.andP;  However, that is not enough.andP;  As responsible government managersthey must go beyond its requirements.andM;Senior government officials must focus on their organizations'decision-making processes in ferreting out real conflicts of interest.andP;  Theymust recognize that financial interests are not the only source of conflictsof interest and may not even be the most important.andM;Friendships, dislikes and biases, whether in policy-making and procurement orin hiring and promotion practices, all can lead to decisions that are not inthe public interest.andM;Senior government officials especially must not reward seemingly meritoriousachievements without considering the means used to accomplish them.andP;  To do sonot only condones but also encourages unethical behavior.andP;  This applies notonly to the employees who report to them but also to the vendors who marketto them.andM;Ethics in government is not ensured through the &quot;censorship&quot; function,however praiseworthy its objectives may be.andP;  The senior government official,as an individual, has to adopt a meaningful ethical code and share it withhis organization if the public interest is to be served.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
