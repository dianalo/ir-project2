A Lilco-state deal that kills the utility's Shoreham nuclear power plant in exchange for rate increases and other financial incentives hasn't yet been hammered out. But it has been agreed that the New York Power Authority, a state agency, will effectively assume responsibility for meeting Long Island's future electricity needs.    Sources close to the negotiations say the agency will implement Lilco's plans for providing close to 2,000 megawatts of additional power for rapidly expanding Long Island over the next few years. Under the agreement, Lilco likely won't build any generating facilities of its own until after the year 2000.    Specifically, the power authority, which already operates a number of nuclear and hydropower plants in New York state, would build gas-turbine units providing about 250 megawatts to meet the island's critical immediate need for power. It also would build a cable under Long Island Sound that would provide as much as another 600 megawatts of power by 1991. And the agency apparently would be responsible for lining up about 1,000 megawatts of other capacity, much of which is expected to come from a wealth of new cogeneration and other independent-power projects.    Indeed, one state official, who asked not to be identified, predicted that Long Island will become a &quot;hot bed of cogeneration activity.&quot; He further predicted that the Lilco-state deal will &quot;usher in a new era&quot; for independent-power production. He explained that while many utilities are now relying on independent producers for some of their new generating needs, this would be the first time a utility relied exclusively on outside sources.    Cogeneration is the simultaneous production of electricity and steam heat from a single fuel source, such as natural gas or garbage. A utility's own industrial customers often find that they can both satisfy their own power needs and make money by selling any excess electricity to the local power company, which is legally obligated to buy that excess.    One independent power producer, Long Lake Energy Corp., New York, already has announced its intention of buying from Lilco turbine generators and selling the 238 megawatts of power they produce back to the Hicksville, N.Y., utility. Lilco wasn't able to persuade any community to agree to be the site of its generators, but Long Lake said it will fare better.    The state and Lilco may also end up sitting side-by-side in Lilco's executive suite. Wall Street sources said the prospective deal calls for at least one member of another state agency, the Long Island Power Authority, to sit on Lilco's board.    The Long Island agency, which was created by the state legislature specifically to weigh a public takeover of Lilco, has proposed paying $12 a share for all Lilco common as part of a takeover bid valued at $9.8 billion. Lilco hasn't yet responded to that offer.    These same sources said the Lilco seat would be offered to the Long Island agency as an inducement to get the authority to back the Lilco-state deal. While the state already controls three of the Long Island agency's nine directors, several others are die-hard public-power advocates whose support for the deal should be difficult to obtain.    Separately, Lilco opponents said yesterday that they will meet with New York Gov. Mario Cuomo's negotiators this morning. At the meeting, they will question the optimistic forecast of a dividend resumption by 1989 and other aspects of the Lilco-state deal. </TEXT></DOC>
