A book and a movie are being considered, a civil suit against thecriminal justice system that set Dotson's torturous odyssey inmotion is possible, and college is another option on his suddenlyexpanding horizon, his lawyer says.   But Thomas Breen, the attorney, says the most important matter athand is to return the 32-year-old Dotson to sound emotional footing.   ``Let's be honest,'' Breen said. ``He wasn't the most sympatheticcharacter in the world, but it would have been impossible for almostanyone to toe the line he had to walk _ especially someone with adrinking problem.   ``On the other hand, anybody who doesn't have compassion orsympathy for a kid that was jailed for part of his life for a crimethat never occurred, well, that person has a bigger problem than myclient.''   Dotson's problems began in 1977 when Cathleen Crowell Webb, thena high school student, claimed she had been sexually assaulted andidentified Dotson as her attacker. She said in 1985, after she hadmoved to New Hampshire, that she was never attacked, and had wronglyaccused Dotson.   But by then he had been convicted of the rape and sent to toughstate prisons where he ended up serving six years. Based on Mrs.Webb's recantation, he was granted clemency by Gov. James R.Thompson _ allowing him to leave prison in May 1985. But the rapeconviction stayed on his record.   Finally, last Monday, he was cleared when Cook County CircuitJudge Thomas Fitzgerald vacated the 1979 rape conviction andprosecutors said they would not seek a new trial. Fitzgerald saidrecent DNA tests of evidence from the rape case would be admissibleif a new trial were held. Defense lawyers said the DNA``fingerprinting'' tests _ which did not exist a decade ago _indicated Dotson could not have been responsible for the semen foundin Mrs. Webb's panties.   Prosecutors suggested that a lack of corroborating evidence andMrs. Webb's testimony would be greater obstacles to a second rapeconviction than the new DNA test.   Mrs. Webb's recantation is still ``shrouded in mystery'' and heractions since coming forward in 1985 ``have had a negative impact onher future reliability as a witness,'' said Assistant Cook CountyState's Attorney Gayle Shines.   Dotson walked out of Fitzgerald's courtroom last week lookingtanned, more fit and confident than he had in recent years.   ``It's over,'' Dotson told a crowd of reporters. ``As they say,this is the first day of the rest of my life. ... As far as I'mconcerned, my name has been cleared.''   He said he harbored no animosity against Mrs. Webb. ``I forgaveher a long time ago,'' he said.   The role of Mrs. Webb, now of Harrisville, N.H., is puzzling.   Mrs. Webb said she concocted the tale of rape because she fearedshe had become pregnant by a teen-age boyfriend. A born-againBaptist and the mother of three children, she said ``obedience toGod'' prompted her to come forward and recant her accusations.   She encountered ridicule in many quarters, failed to convince ajudge or Thompson of Dotson's innocence, and gained little butnotoriety for all the time and money expended.   Yet, she was heartened by last week's developments.   ``I wanted to see Gary's name cleared,'' she said during atelevision interview at her New Hampshire home. ``That's done, but Iwon't feel right until his life is restored to where it was before Ipointed the finger at him.''   Dotson's initial trial and appeal lasted two years, draining hisfamily's meager resources.   The four years since his 1985 release found him battling analcohol problem, arrested a half-dozen times for traffic violationsand another time following a domestic disturbance. He was put backbehind bars several times. He got married, became a father andalmost as quickly separated from his wife.   Celebrity was a millstone, bringing taunts from strangers intaverns and on the street. But he was unwilling to give up thestruggle to clear his name.   Dotson was granted a temporary pass to attend last Monday'shearing from the drug and alcohol-abuse center where he had beenserving a year-long sentence for a parole violation. He plans tospend at least another month there _ on a voluntary basis.   Dotson, of suburban County Club Hills, is hoping to build on thebitter years. He said schooling was his most immediate concern,followed perhaps by a career in counseling.   ``I've been through enough to relate to a lot of problems,'' hesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
