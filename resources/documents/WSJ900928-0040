They believe Mitterrand's U.N. proposal is only the firstof many calls for negotiations with Saddam Hussein --possibly trading withdrawal from Kuwait for access to aKuwaiti island in the Gulf, greater control of a rich borderoil field, and forgiveness of Iraq's $10 billion debt toKuwait.</LP><TEXT>   Iraq probably could have had such an accord withoutinvading and bringing world opprobrium down on itself. Butthe U.S. remains adamantly opposed to granting even symbolicconcessions, saying it could accept Iraq-Kuwait talks onthese issues only after an unconditional withdrawal.   Meanwhile, officials privately worry that Kuwait's exiledemir might cut a secret deal with Iraq, offering concessionshimself in return for restoration of his government.                                                                                                          POLITICAL PRESSURES keep building on Bush as energy pricesrise. While officials hope the decision to tap the strategicreserve will damp psychological pressures pushing prices up,lawmakers criticize the White House refusal to takeadditional measures. Democratic Sen. Lieberman calls forprohibiting companies from charging &quot;excessive prices&quot; duringemergencies. GOP Sen. Packwood urges readoption of thewindfall-profits tax.   Administration officials fear an abnormally cold winter ora major refinery accident could send prices -- and politicalpressure -- spiraling anew. Even as Bush jawbones oilcompanies to keep prices down, Energy Department officialscomplain there's nothing they can do to prevent the firmsfrom exporting gasoline and heating oil to Europe, whereprices are higher.                                                                                                          WHOSE RECESSION? Officials seek a scapegoat in Greenspan.   Bush aides continue to mute their criticism of the Fedchairman in public, fearing that too much recession talk willalarm consumers and further weaken the economy. But they stepup behind-the-scenes criticism of the Fed's reluctance tolower interest rates in the face of worsening indicators.   Many business economists share that view. Nearly 60% in arecent survey say the Fed is being too stingy; normally, 60%to 70% of the economists endorse whatever policy the Fed isfollowing. But Greenspan defenders warn the Fed can't offsetthe damage that higher oil prices are doing.   Despite its impatience with the Fed, the administration isnowhere near choosing a replacement for Vice Chairman ManuelJohnson, who quit almost four months ago.                                                                                                          OFFICIALS DISMISS private suggestions from Syrian dictatorAssad that an Iraqi coup is possible soon; they say SaddamHussein's network of informers and habit of killing ratherthan exiling foes make a successful plot unlikely. But theadministration, as well as Turkey's Ozal, say a coup mightoccur if war breaks out.
