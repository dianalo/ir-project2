Background</ITAG>The Social Security Amendments of 1972 (Pub. L. 92-603) extended Medicarecoverage to individuals with end stage renal disease (ESRD) who requiredialysis or transplantation. Section 1881 of the Social Security Act (theAct) provides for Medicare payment for kidney transplantation. One of themajor components of kidney transplantation is the retrieval of organs throughan organ procurement organization (OPO). An OPO, whether independent orhospital-based, is defined in Medicare regulations (42 CFR 485.302 as publishedon March 1, 1988, 53 FR 6526) as an organization that performs or coordinatesthe performance of retrieving, preserving, and transporting organs andmaintains a system to locate prospective recipients for available organs.Since the inception of the ESRD program, OPOs have procured kidneys fromdonors. Once kidneys are retrieved, the OPO searches for and identifiesacceptable recipients and coordinates transporting these kidneys to otherOPOs, transplant centers or foreign countries. The OPO places kidneys witha transplant organization based on the best possible match of tissue type,blood type, etc., as well as consideration for cold ischemic time (theamount of time a kidney has been outside the body and packed on ice), transportationdistance, etc.The Medicare program pays separately for kidney acquisition services andkidney transplantations. The OPO bills each of the organizations that receivekidneys a standard acquisition charge for each kidney. The standard acquisitioncharge reflects the cost of removing, preserving, and transporting a kidney,etc. While a hospital-based OPO develops its own charge, an independentOPO's charge is developed by its Medicare fiscal intermediary based onthe OPO's costs of operating. These standard acquisition charges becomethe interim payment for each OPO. The OPO submits its cost of operatingon a cost report at the end of its fiscal year. The cost report detailsboth the costs of procuring kidneys and the amounts received from the shipmentof kidneys to other OPOs, transplant centers, military hospitals, VeteransAdministration (VA) hospitals, and foreign countries. The net differencebetween the total cost and the total amount received represents the amountdue to or from the intermediary.The Medicare program has always paid the total costs of OPOs because weassumed that all kidneys procured were for Medicare beneficiaries. However,we now realize that this assumption is incorrect and that technology hasallowed a significant number of kidneys to be shipped overseas. Since theMedicare program has been paying the cost of procuring kidneys shippedoverseas or transplanted into patients other than Medicare beneficiaries,we believe that some action needs to be taken. It is now necessary to amendthe regulations in order to effectuate the statutory principles embodiedin section 1861(v)(1)(A) of the Act. Section 1861(v)(1)(A) of the Act requiresthat the cost of services be borne by the appropriate payer. Accordingly,the cost associated with the kidneys not used by Medicare beneficiariesmust be borne by the responsible individual or third party payer. Medicareis precluded from paying any costs associated with kidneys not used byMedicare beneficiaries.On March 2, 1988, we published a proposed rule (53 FR 6672) that wouldexclude the costs associated with kidneys sent to foreign countries ortransplanted in patients other than Medicare beneficiaries from Medicarepayments made to OPOs.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Provisions of the Proposed Rule</ITAG>The preamble to the March 2, 1988 proposed rule (53 FR 6673) includes anexplanation of current kidney transplantation practices and the proposedregulation provisions and rationale. The final regulation provisions thatappear in section IV of this preamble restate the proposed regulation provisions,with the few exceptions noted in that section.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Analysis of and Responses to Public Comments</ITAG>We received 10 timely comments in response to the March 2, 1988 proposedrule. Comments were submitted by OPOs, a nurses' association, and two grouphealth insurance organizations. The major comments and our responses follow.<T3>Comment: </T3>Some commenters suggested that we require that all organsbe procured through the national Organ Procurement and TransplantationNetwork (OPTN) before sending them to a foreign country. They also believethat kidneys should not be sent to a foreign country unless all costs arepaid by the foreign transplant center.<T3>Response: </T3>All Medicare-certified OPOs are required to query theOPTN system for a suitable recipient in the United States if the procuredorgans cannot be used locally. We agree that this is a necessary requirementto ensure that there is not a suitable recipient in this country. However,it is not the responsibility of the OPTN to arrange or coordinate the exportationor importation of organs, and OPSs are free to make these arrangementsdirectly. As for payment, it is the responsibility of the OPO, not theOPTN, to assure that the foreign transplant center pays the costs of theorgan.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter stated that Canada should not be characterizedas a foreign country because of its willingness to share organs.<T3>Response: </T3>We cannot accept this suggestion. Section 1862(a)(4)of the Act and Medicare regulations at 42 CFR 405.313 preclude reimbursementby the Medicare program for services performed outside the United States.Therefore, any organs sent to recipients in Canada will be treated as organssent to a foreign country. Of course, nothing in this requirement needimpede organ transfers between the two countries provided that proper costaccounting and billing procedures are followed.<T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters expressed concerns that implementingthese regulations would result in an unrecoverable financial loss to nonprofitOPOs or an increase in the discard rate.<T3>Response: </T3>The Medicare program has always tried to ensure thatit pays only for the services furnished to its beneficiaries. Servicesfurnished to other than Medicare beneficiaries should be paid by thosepatients or their third-party payers. We are not prohibiting an OPO fromsending organs to a foreign country; we are simply not reimbursing thesecosts under the Medicare program. Section 1861(v)(1)(A) of the Act requiresthe Medicare program to pay only for the services furnished to Medicarebeneficiaries.While it is true that OPOs are at risk for any financial loss that mayoccur, we believe that there has been ample time for OPOs to set up memorandaof understanding or lines of credit with selected foreign transplant programsto ensure payment for these organs.<T3>Comment: </T3>We received a comment that criticized excluding fromMedicare payment the cost of kidneys ``when all attempts to utilize theorgans in Medicare beneficiaries have failed''. The commenter believesthat kidneys will be wasted.<T3>Response: </T3>We agree that some of these kidneys may be wasted ifnot used in this country or sent to a foreign transplant center. Costsfor kidneys that are wasted and not used either in this country or in aforeign country will be included in the OPOs' cost reports and paid byMedicare based on the ratio of Medicare kidneys to total kidneys. However,we believe that when a kidney is shipped to a foreign country and usedin that country, the Medicare program should not be responsible for thecost of that kidney. Accordingly, if a kidney is sent to a foreign country,Medicare will not longer subsidize the cost of procuring that kidney.<T3>Comment: </T3>In an effort to encourage the use of kidneys in thiscountry rather than sending them to foreign countries, a commenter suggestedthat we increase the length of stay limits under the diagnosis relatedgroup (DRG). The commenter believes that this suggestion may encouragephysicians to use kidneys that have been preserved longer than 40 hours.<T3>Response: </T3>First, we believe it is necessary to point out Medicaredoes not have any length of stay limits for transplanation or for any otherDRG. Secondly, Medicare has two methods that will allow a facility to receiveadditional reimbursement for atypical cases. Additional DRG payments areavailable to hospitals when the length of stay for a transplant exceedsa specific number of days, or when the cost of services exceeds prescribedthresholds (See andSection;andSection; 412.82 and 412.84.). Accordingly, thereis no payment barrier to the use of kidneys that have been preserved inexcess of 40 hours and we see no reason to increase the DRG payment forthese kidneys.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter explained a long-standing reciprocal organacquisition arrangement its OPO has with a U.S. military hospital in itsarea. The military renal transplant program (MRTP) is a recipient of kidneysfor transplant from the OPO. The OPO and MRTP developed a Memorandum ofUnderstanding due to the fact that military hospitals have no system thatallows them to charge civilian OPOs for organ recovery costs. MRTP getsfirst choice on kidneys recovered from military hospitals, although only44 of the 124 organs procured in the past 5 years were retained by theMRTP. Eighty organs were used by Medicare certified transplant centers.For kidneys retained by the MRTP, there are no charges by either the OPOor the military hospital for their respective organ recovery costs. Underthis long-standing arrangement, the commenter believes its OPO would beadversely affected by the proposed regulation and increased costs to theOPO and the Medicare program would result.<T3>Response: </T3>As a result of this long-standing arrangement that isbeneficial to the Medicare program, we find it necessary to revise theproposed regulation so that equitable reimbursement to the OPO is maintained.Any special arrangement such as the one mentioned above that was in effectbefore March 3, 1988 (the publication date of the proposed rule) will beaccepted. For these cases, the kidneys procured by an OPO at a militaryrenal transplant hospital and retained for transplant at the hospital willbe deemed as Medicare kidneys for cost reporting statistical purposes.While we know of no other special arrangements, if any similar arrangementsexisted before March 3, 1988, the OPO must submit a request to the fiscalintermediary for review and approval of these arrangements. Absent a specialarrangement that existed before March 3, 1988, all kidneys sent to a non-Medicareinstitution are to be treated as non-Medicare kidneys.<T3>Comment:</T3> A commenter stated that included in its hospital-basedtransplant program costs are a significant amount of pre-transplant costsand living related donor costs that would be partially excluded if a kidneywas shipped to a foreign country or transplanted into a patient other thana Medicare beneficiary. The commenter suggested that these costs be removedbefore any computation that would eliminate the cost of kidneys sent toforeign countries or transplanted into patients other than Medicare beneficiaries.<T3>Response:</T3> With respect to pre-transplant costs, we believe thatthe costs of laboratory tests for waiting list candidates are legitimatecosts that should be included with the non-Medicare kidney cost allocation.Living related costs are normal hospital procurement costs that shouldbe included in the overall cost. The amount of non-Medicare costs thatwill be removed will be a proportionate share of an average of the totalcosts incurred by the transplant center. In fact, living related acquisitioncosts are not significantly different from cadaveric acquisition costs.Based on these considerations, we do not see the need for the more sophisticatedrecordkeeping system that this change will require.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter questioned the proper handling of patientswho are in their first 12 months of ESRD coverage and who are partiallyor totally covered by group health insurance. The commenter questionedif these secondary payer situations would be considered Medicare transplantsor non-Medicare.<T3>Response:</T3> We plan to treat secondary payer issues in exactly thesame manner as we do all other hospital services. Specifically, if a beneficiaryhas primary insurance coverage and payment by the primary payer satisfiesthe liability of the Medicare program, the transplant will be considereda non-Medicare transplant for cost reporting purposes. If the primary payerdoes not satisfy all of the Medicare program's liability, the transplantwill be considered a Medicare transplant for cost reporting purposes. Thisis consistent with Medicare billing and cost reporting instructions.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter stated that it is possible for an OPO tosell an organ to a foreign transplant center in excess of its cost. Thecommenter believes that this situation conflicts with section 301 of theNational Organ Transplant Act (Pub. L. 98-507), which prohibits the saleof human organs in excess of the cost to acquire them.<T3>Response:</T3> We are also concerned with the sale of human organsfor a profit. Even though this regulation is silent on the issue, we expectall intermediaries that discover what appears to be a profit-making arrangement,for not only kidneys but any human organs, to notify the Office of theInspector General.<T3>Comment:</T3> Several commenters mentioned that it is impossible foran OPO to know whether or not the recipient at the transplant center isa Medicare beneficiary.<T3>Response:</T3> As stated in the proposed rule (53 FR 6674) any kidneysent to a Medicare-certified transplant center from an OPO will be assumedto be used for Medicare beneficiaries. Once the kidney is received by thetransplant center, actual transplant experience will dictate the cost reporttreatment of these organs. In addition, as mentioned above, kidneys sentto U.S. military transplant hospitals will be treated as Medicare kidneyson the OPO's Medicare cost report.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Provisions of this Final Rule</ITAG>The regulation provisions of this final rule, for the most part, restatethe regulation provisions of the proposed rule. The final rule differsfrom the proposed rule in that we_andbullet; Replaced the term ``organ procurement agency (OPA)'' with ``organprocurement organization (OPO)'' to conform the language to final regulationsthat were published on March 1, 1988 (53 FR 6526) for OPOs and organ procurementprotocols;andbullet; Replaced the use of the term ``harvest'' with ``procure'' in responseto comments we received; andandbullet; Revised the examples we used in discussing the regulation provisionsin response to concerns raised by commenters about military hospitals andthe number of nonviable kidneys.For the reasons explained in the proposed rule, we are adding a new regulationsection (42 CFR 413.179) that applies to all OPOs and any Medicare-certifiedtransplant centers that claim kidney acquisition costs on worksheet D-6of the Hospital Cost Report (HCFA-2552). (42 CFR Part 413 was establishedon September 30, 1986, at 51 FR 34790.) We will require that kidneys sentto foreign transplant centers or transplanted in patients other than Medicarebeneficiaries be excluded from Medicare payments to OPOs. OPOs that sendkidneys to foreign countries must ensure that they receive the full amountfrom the foreign transplant centers for procurement and transportationof the kidneys. We will require OPOs to separate costs associated withkidneys that are sent to foreign countries or transplanted in patientsother than Medicare beneficiaries from Medicare allowable costs prior tofinal settlement by the Medicare fiscal intermediary. The fiscal intermediarywill compute the ratio of the number of kidneys used for Medicare beneficiariesto the total number of kidneys used and adjust the costs for kidneys sentto foreign countries or transplanted in patients other than Medicare beneficiaries.For this purpose, kidneys furnished to other OPOs or Medicare-certifiedtransplant centers in the United States will be assumed to be used fortransplants in Medicare beneficiaries. As explained earlier in our responseto a comment, we will treat kidneys sent to U.S. military institutionsin the same manner as kidneys sent to any other Medicare-certified transplantcenters from an OPO. Accordingly, any kidney sent to a Medicare-certifiedtransplant center or to one of the two U.S military transplant centersby a certified OPO will be deemed to be a Medicare kidney for reimbursementpurposes on the OPO's cost report. However, any costs associated with kidneytransplants for patients other than Medicare beneficiaries that are performedin transplant centers will be excluded from total costs of the transplantcenters, thereby excluding them from Medicare reimbursement. (The Medicareprogram will continue to pay for its proportionate share of costs incurredin procuring kidneys that were not transplanted.)We issued contractor operating instructions to the Provider ReimbursementManual (HCFA Pub. 15-2, Part II, Chapter 21) in January 1987 that requireall OPOs to maintain a log detailing placement efforts effective February4, 1987. (In the proposed rule, we inadvertently referred to January 1988instructions.) This is intended to document the efforts that OPOs are makingto place kidneys in Medicare beneficiaries before shipping kidneys overseas.We have detailed below two examples using identical data that show themethod of reimbursing OPOs for kidney acquisition costs under the currentand revised methodologies.<ITAG tagnum="15">Total Kidneys_130 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Total Usable Kidneys_120 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Total Nonviable Kidneys_10 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Total Foreign Kidneys_20 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Total Military Kidneys_10 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Total VA Kidneys_10 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Total Cost_$1,200,000 \1\</ITAG><NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Included in the $1,200,000 total cost are costs associatedwith nonviable (unusable) kidneys.

OPOs may recoupcosts of kidneys from patients other than Medcicare beneficiaries or foreigncountries that receive the kidneys.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Regulatory Impact Statement</ITAG>Executive Order 12291 (E.O. 12291) requires us to prepare and publish aregulatory impact analysis for any final regulations that are likely tomeet criteria for a ``major rule.'' A major rule is one that results in:(1) An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more;(2) A major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, State, or local government agencies, or any geographic regions;or(3) Significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.In addition, consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C.601-612), we prepare and publish a regulatory flexibility analysis forfinal regulations unless the Secretary certifies that the regulations willnot have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.For purposes of the RFA, we consider OPOs to be small entities.Currently, there are 72 OPOs, 50 of which are independent (that is, nothospital-based). We expect that the revised system will result in reducedpayments to some OPOs, since the Medicare program will no longer subsidizethe costs of kidneys that are sent to foreign countries or transplantedin patients other than Medicare beneficiaries. It will result in some programsavings, estimated to be approxiamtely $1 million for the first full yearof implementation of this regulation. While we expect that some OPOs willexperience reductions in Medicare revenues, these reductions will not besubstantial unless an OPO provides a disproportionately large number ofkidneys to foreign countries. This rule will have an adverse effect ontotal revenue only if an OPO is unable to obtain payment for the costsassociated with kidneys transplanted into patients other than Medicarebeneficiaries or sent to foreign countries. We do not believe this is likely;rather, we believe that OPOs will be able to recover their costs not reimbursedby Medicare from patients other than Medicare beneficiaries and foreigntransplant centers.As discussed above, one potential consequence of this change will be anincrease in the number of kidneys available for Medicare beneficiarieswho need transplants. To the extent that this potential is realized, therewill be resulting reductions in Medicare expenditures since patients canbe transferred from more costly dialysis to less costly transplantation.These savings will be contingent on matching kidneys with appropriate recipientswithin a time period considered acceptable. To some extent this may dependon whether U.S. surgeons accept kidneys with a longer cold ischemic timefor transplantation. Thus, the savings are not estimable.We have determined that this regulation does not meet the criteria of E.O.12291 and does not require a regulatory impact analysis. Also, we havedetermined, and the Secretary certifies, that this final rule will nothave a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.Therefore, a regulatory flexibility analysis has not been prepared.In addition, section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to preparea regulatory impact analysis for any final rule that may have a significantimpact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals.This analysis must conform to the provisions of section 604 of the RFA.For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural hospitalas a hospital with fewer than 50 beds located outside a metropolitan statisticalarea. We have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that this finalrule will not have a significant economic impact on the operations of asubstantial number of small rural hospitals.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Information Collection Requirements</ITAG>This rule contains no information collection requirements, therefore, itdoes not come under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980(44 U.S.C. 3501).<ITAG tagnum="84">VI.
