Now, after the suppression of the pro-democracy movement, it maybe impossible.   The result could be a continuing and damaging brain drain for anation whose leaders have been trying to bring it fully up to modernstandards.   Since the June 3-4 military crackdown in Beijing, the major hostcountries for Chinese students have announced that Chinese mayextend their stays.   The United States, home to half of the 80,000 Chinese studyingabroad, says they can stay at least another year. Canadian PrimeMinister Brian Mulroney told the nation's 4,000 Chinese studentsthey can stay until the situation in their country stabilizes.   Britain is extending visas for its 3,500 Chinese students, as areNew Zealand, West Germany, Japan and France. Australia says nearlyall of the 10,000 students there have inquired about prolongingtheir stay.   ``I would say that all of them will stay if possible,'' said TianKun, a former University of Maryland student who returned to Chinaafter obtaining U.S. citizenship.   Before June, most gave up their motherland because of economicreasons. Chinese scientists or engineers who could command highsalaries in the United States had little incentive to return toChina for jobs that pay less than 200 yuan ($54) a month.   The newspaper Economic Information recently acknowledged manystay away because of a lack of suitable jobs in China and a rigidseniority system that stifles their talents. Many also fear theynever will be permitted to go abroad again, it said.   Many fear the more threatening prospect of being drawn into thevortex of political repression. Thousands of Chinese abroad marchedin demonstrations or expressed sympathy for the democratic goals ofthe students in Tiananmen Square. Many face certain repercussions _from political indoctrination to jail _ if they return.   ``If China becomes a democratic country, I will go back,'' saidQian Songnian, a physicist at Dartmouth College. ``But in thissituation, certainly not.''   The Chinese government, which began sending students abroad adecade ago under senior leader Deng Xiaoping's open-door policy, hasgenerally shrugged off the brain-drain problem.   The government says about 90 percent of the 35,000 state-fundedstudents aboard will come home. Many have little choice. The UnitedStates and other countries have ensured that students do notoverstay their visas, and students usually are forced to leave theirfamilies behind in China.   The government has far less control over private students _usually younger and more independent _ who receive scholarships orfinancial support from overseas relatives.   ``Many private students will try to transfer to Canadian schoolsafter their American visas expire,'' Miss Tian said. ``They willthink of everything they can'' to avoid coming back.   China so far has shown no signs of stopping its foreign studiesprograms, partly because the children of senior leaders are amongthe beneficiaries. Senior leader Deng and Communist Party GeneralSecretary Zhao Ziyang are two of the many officials whose childrenhave studied abroad.   China, however, has tried to tighten controls by limitingscholarships to older, postgraduate students with greater job andfamily ties at home. Last year, universities sent only 600 studentsabroad, while 4,000 went from research centers and institutes.Almost all are in engineering, science and other applied fields.   ``It is the students' unshirkable duty and responsibility to comeback on schedule to serve the country when they have finished theirstudies,'' educator Huang Xinbai said last year.   But for the hundreds of young people whose visions of a freerChina were shattered by the tanks rolling into Tiananmen Square,thoughts are mainly of escape.   ``I'm just trying to leave the country,'' said one BeijingUniversity student. ``For more than 2,000 years, Chinese have put upwith governments like this. It will take a long time to change.''</TEXT></DOC>
