In that recession-battered city, where unemployment hasjumped by 60,000 people over the past year, Brigham andWomen's Hospital is looking to hire 300 workers -- fromnurses and X-ray technicians to cooks and administrators.</LP><TEXT>   In today's sick economy, the health-care industry ishealthier than ever.   In fact, health care is about the only industry in theU.S. that's flourishing. Since August, the economy has lost828,000 jobs, the Labor Department says. But during thattime, health-care employers have added 241,000 positions,according to the department.   While many workers in other industries face pay freezes orminimal raises, salaries of health-care workers last yearrose 6%, the highest of any occupation and nearly equal tothe 6.1% inflation rate, government figures show. At Brighamand Women's, salaries rose an average of 8% last year.   The vitality of health care is attracting growing numbersof people from other professions. Jeanes Health System, asmall Quaker hospital in Philadelphia, had 80 applicants foran assistant public relations director job paying a bit morethan $30,000. Some had more than 15 years of experience. Oneof the three finalists came from the ailing real-estateindustry.   &quot;Now we're even seeing people willing to take a stepbackward in job and salary to work in health care becausethey see it as a stable industry,&quot; says Ken Trestor, directorof planning and marketing at the University of MichiganMedical Center, where the full-time work force has grown byabout 600 people in the past year.   Health care so far is unscarred by the recession partlybecause people can't put off getting sick the way they canpostpone buying a new car. Also, since most Americans havesome form of health insurance, they don't shop around as theywould if they were picking up the tab themselves.   Technology and scientific advances also guaranteeexpansion. Many hospitals feel they need the latest equipmentto maintain their reputations, attract doctors and providethe best treatment. A new machine or procedure often meansadding staff. Brigham and Women's hospital recently begandoing lung transplants; that required bringing on new doctorsand expert staff.   Changes in demographics and methods of treatment are alsobringing growth. The Medical Center Hospital of Vermont, thestate's largest health-care institution, wants to build afacility to serve the region's growing elderly populationand, following recent medical trends, provide more outpatienttreatment.   Some analysts argue that the recession itself might boostthe health-care industry. Recently laid-off workers and thosewho fear they could lose their jobs often rush to takeadvantage of their health benefits while they still havethem.   One area of health care that's clearly drawing morebusiness in these stressful economic times is counselingservices. Human Affairs International Inc., which providesemployee-assistance programs to businesses world-wide,reports increases of 2% to 3% in the use of its services atcompanies that are downsizing. &quot;We see mostly what we callanxiety disorders, mood disorders,&quot; says Donald McKean, thecompany's national director of sales.   But no industry is immune from recession, and somehospitals and doctors already are being squeezed bygovernment cutbacks in medical spending. If the slumppersists, health care may fall ill, too, says Mark Pauly, ahealth economist at the University of Pennsylvania's WhartonSchool, &quot;as people lose their health insurance and perhaps asfirms finally get serious about controlling their health-carecosts.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
