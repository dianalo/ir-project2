Most social programs showed at least modest gains in Reagan'selection-year budget for fiscal 1989, as the president abandonedperennial proposals for cuts that Congress has largely ignored inprevious years.   The most striking increase was the $1.3 billion request forresearch and education on the deadly AIDS virus, up by $349million, or 38 percent, from the current level. Reagan said,``Addressing the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome epidemic isthe highest public health priority of the administration.''   The government also estimated that its cost of paying welfareand Medicaid benefits for AIDS victims will soar in the year aheadto $736 million from $461 million. That makes the total federalcosts more than $2 billion.   One year after he sought to cut nearly $5 billion from theDepartment of Education's budget, Reagan asked Congress to raiseits spending by $1.5 billion, or nearly 8 percent, to $20.3 billion.   The biggest education gain would be in the Pell Grant programfor needy college students, which would climb by $590 million toalmost $5 billion. Reagan would raise the maximum grant to $2,300,a $100 increase, and award 247,000 more grants. The program nowhelps 3.15 million college and trade school students.   Disadvantaged children in elementary schools would be helped bytwo budget increases: a $238 million increase to $4.6 billion forthe Chapter 1 remedial education program, and a $43 million boostto $115 million in aid for magnet schools. Reagan wants to make themagnet school aid available more freely, and not just for schooldesegregation.   Carrying through on an initiative announced in the State of theUnion address, Reagan said he will propose legislation to allowlow- and middle-income families to earn interest tax-free onsavings bonds for college.   The Department of Health and Human Services' budget would growby 5.8 percent, from $375.1 billion to $396.8 billion, includingSocial Security and Medicare.   Social Security's old age and disability programs alone areexpected to grow by $14 billion, or 6.4 percent, to $233.8 billion.``The administration proposes no changes in Social Securitybenefits,'' Reagan said. Thirty-eight million people receivebenefits, and the average retired worker and spouses will draw$10,500 in 1988, an increase of nearly $3,700 over the 1981 level.   Medicaid grants, which help states provide health insurance for25 million poor people, will cost the federal government $32.7billion in 1989, up 7 percent from $30.7 billion currently. Underthe recent budget agreement with Congress, Reagan proposed noMedicaid cuts for 1989.   Medicare spending, for 33 million elderly or disabled workers,is projected to rise to $84 billion from $78.9 billion, and Reaganproposed $1.2 billion in cuts to meet the deficit-reduction targetsthat Congress and the administration agreed to in December.   The budget proposes to limit Medicare payments for durablemedical equipment, reduce payments for radiology and anesthesiologyservices, ``close a loophole in payments for home dialysistreatment for end-stage renal disease,'' intensify screening ofphysician claims by program contractors, and make permanent arequirement that Medicare Part B monthly premiums _ now $24.80 _cover 25 percent of the program costs.   The budget proposes phasing out the low-income energy blockgrant over four years, starting with a $300 million cut to $1.2billion for 1989.   It would also reduce the community services block grant by $57million to $349 million, and eliminate funds for the $93 millionWork Incentive Program for welfare families.</TEXT></DOC>
