RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   People who do not own property may not beexcluded for that reason from membership on a public body empoweredto recommend a reorganization of local government, a unanimousSupreme Court ruled today.   The court declared unconstitutional the composition of the St.Louis City-St. Louis County Board of Freeholders.   Justice Harry A. Blackmun, writing for the court, said aland-ownership requirement for appointment to such a public agencyviolates the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection under lawfor all people.   ``The mere fact that the board of freeholders considers land-useissues cannot suffice to sustain a land-ownership requirement inthis case,'' he said.   The St. Louis freeholder board was created to write a proposedcharter for reorganizing the city and county government structure.The board also was empowered to recommend new taxes to finance thecity and county governments.   Any proposals by the board would be submitted to the voters in areferendum.   Board members were appointed by the mayor of St. Louis, thecounty executive and the governor of Missouri.   State Representative Robert J. Quinn, a St. Louis County residentwho does not own property, said his rights were violated by a stateconstitutional requirement limiting membership on the freeholderboard to property owners.   Quinn, in a suit on behalf of himself and all others in the cityand county who do not own property, said the exclusion violated theU.S. Constitution's guarantee of freedom from unlawfuldiscrimination.   But the Missouri Supreme Court ruled last year that theconstitutional protection does not apply because the freeholderboard does not have ``general governmental powers.''   Blackmun said today that even though the freeholder board has alimited role, that does not mean its composition can violateconstitutional protections against ``invidious discrimination.''   The case is Quinn vs. Millsap, 88-1048.</TEXT></DOC>
