Justo Ricardo Somarriba, along with his wife and three children,had faced the prospect of having to take the money back toNicaragua if the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service backeda State Department finding that his political asylum claim wasfrivolous.   But today INS district director Perry Rivkind said he personallyhad reviewed the case and granted the asylum.   ``This has nothing to do with the jackpot,'' Rivkind said. ``Hewas a teacher in the government education department, and heresisted propagandizing on behalf of the Sandinista Marxistgovernment.''   That could subject him to political persecution if he returnedto his homeland, Rivkind said.   Even if he hadn't been granted asylum, state lottery officialssaid he still would have gotten his half of last week's $10.6million Lotto jackpot.   ``Anybody who wins keeps the money,'' said Ed George, a lotteryspokesman in Tallahassee. In California, an illegal Mexicanimmigrant was deported _ with his money _ after winning the lotteryin that state.   Somarriba received the first of 20 annual checks for about$264,000 at a ceremony Monday in Tallahassee.   Somarriba, 30, from Masaya, Nicaragua, a rural town about 90miles south of Managua, entered the country by crossing the RioGrande near Brownsville, Texas, on March 22, 1987, said RichardSmith, Rivkind's deputy.   He filed his application for asylum on May 6, 1987.   ``We notified the State Department that his application wasconsidered frivolous on December 14, 1987. They approved and sentit back to us on January 19, 1988. Since then it has been hung upin paperwork,'' Smith said.   Employees in the asylum unit are about 40,000 applicationsbehind, he said.   Applications deemed frivolous are rarely approved on appeal,Smith added.   Somarriba lives in Miami with his wife, Maria Elena, and threechildren, ages 9, 7 and 3.</TEXT></DOC>
