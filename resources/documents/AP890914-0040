The guerrillas made the proposal Wednesday in their first talkswith the government in two years.   Both sides said they hoped to reach an agreement today on a planfor negotiating an end to nearly a decade of civil war that hasclaimed 70,000 lives.   ``The problem is if we're just going to talk or if we're going totalk about negotiating,'' rebel commander Joaquin Villalobos saidWednesday night.   He said the Salvadoran people are tired of fighting: ``We areconscious the war has to end.''   The U.S.-backed Salvadoran government did not present a peaceplan, but the five-man delegation arrived with a proposal fornegotiating procedures that called for two days of talks every twomonths.   Rebels leaders called that unacceptable and said they wanted afaster-paced negotiating plan.   There were also differences on whether there would be a mediatoror observers and who might play that role.   Despite the differences, both sides said the first day had beenfruitful and that an accord on a negotiating plan was possible.   ``We feel satisfied,'' Justice Minister Oscar Alfredo Santamariatold reporters.   He refused to comment on the rebel peace plan. ``It is a proposalthat needs analyzing,'' he said.   The meeting is the first between the rebels and the electedRepublican Nationalist Alliance government of President AlfredoCristiani, who took office June 1.   Santamaria said the fact that Cristiani had agreed to thesepreliminary talks with the rebel Farabundo Marti National LiberationFront was proof it is serious about peace.   ``We are here to put an end to the war,'' he said.   The rebels' peace proposal calls for a cease-fire by Nov. 15 inexchange for broad including appointing a new Supreme Court andjustice minister and moving up legislative and municipal electionsnow scheduled for 1991.   The guerrillas also said a truce was conditional on reforms inthe military, expanded land reform and the prosecution of deathsquad members.   The founder of Cristiani's party, Roberto D'Aubuisson, has longbeen accused of playing a key role in rightist death squads thathave murdered thousands of leftists, suspected leftists and othergovernment opponents.   If its conditions were met, the rebel group said, it would movetoward becoming a political party.   Under the final stage of their proposal, the guerrillas call forconstitutional and electoral reforms and agreement by the UnitedStates to replace military aid to the Salvadoran government witheconomic aid.   El Salvador is the largest recipient of U.S. aid in thehemisphere.   The rebel plan contains many proposals made and rejected before,but the wording was much milder this time and the rebels havedropped a longstanding insistence on merging their army with thegoverment armed forces.   Their offer to change from a guerrilla force to a political partyis also new. The rebels have boycotted regular elections since 1982,saying the balloting offered only a veneer of democracy.   The government has said it will not negotiate a reduction in themilitary and that if the rebels want reform they should pursue itthrough the political process.   Rebel and government called a temporary cease-fire for thetwo-day peace talks. Negotiations in 1984 and 1987 failed.</TEXT></DOC>
