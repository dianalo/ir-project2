Constitution: In the reactorcore of a nuclear reactor pressure vessel, oxygen in the coolants causesnuclear reaction due to neutron emitted from fuel assemblies to form/sup 16/N as the nitrogen isotope. The thus formed isotope nitrogen isa nuclide that emits high energy {gamma}-ray of about 6 MeV and the partiallytransferred together with main steams to the turbine directly. Further,high energy {gamma}-ray has strong permeability, scatters in the airand reaches the boundary of the sight. In view of the above neutron controllayers such as made of ZrH/sub 2/ for suppressing the generation of nitrogenisotope are disposed at least to the inner surface or the outer surfacein the channel box. As a result, high speed neutrons are deceleratedand controlled by the control layers to attain the purpose of reducingthe dose rate at the inside and the outside of the turbine buildings.(Kamimura, M.).</TEXT></DOC>
