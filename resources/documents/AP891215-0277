Sherwin rejected alast-minute offer that would have cleared him of criminal charges.   Only hours after the government offered the deal Wednesday, afederal jury convicted Sherwin and GAF on all eight counts of stockmanipulation, securities fraud and other charges in an alleged 1986scheme to boost Union Carbide Corp.'s stock price.   Under the deal, GAF would have pleaded guilty to all counts andSherwin would have been released of all charges in the deal,according to lawyers involved in the case. The company reportedlyhad approved the deal.   But as part of the deal, Sherwin would have had to sign astatement saying he was acting on behalf of the company in theunlawful activities alleged by the government.   Lawyers for Sherwin and GAF plan to appeal the verdict.   The GAF verdict, which was viewed as a major victory for thegovernment, came after two mistrials earlier this year.   Lead GAF attorney Arthur Liman in a statement said WATS linetelephone records from the Jefferies andamp; Co. brokerage, whichallegedly conducted the manipulation for GAF, refuted testimonythat calls were made to Sherwin to discuss the October 1986 scheme.   ``(Sherwin) is a man of principle who sat through three trialsthat were tainted by brazen perjury that was finally exposed by theWATS records,'' Liman said in a statement. ``We were under noillusions as to the likely verdict. It was visible on the jurors'faces.   ``But the government insisted on a corporate allocution whichwould have stripped Jim Sherwin of all self respect and condonedthe perjury. This he could not let the corporation do and he has noregrets about the decision he made to allow the jury deliberationsto proceed to verdict.''   Assistant U.S. Attorney Carl H. Loewenson Jr. declined tocomment on the perjury allegation.   The government based its case on testimony by admitted felon andformer stockbroker Boyd L. Jefferies, who testified that he agreedto bid up the price of Union Carbide at Sherwin's request. GAF wasseeking to sell 5 million shares of Union Carbide after a failedtakeover bid.   Jefferies also said Sherwin promised to reimburse the brokeragefor any losses. Evidence included an allegedly phony invoice for$40,000 investment banking advisory services that represented atrading loss.   Jefferies andamp; Co. chief trader James Melton and trading assistantMaureen O'Connor testified about the alleged phone calls.   Melton claimed he called Sherwin at the end of three consecutivetrading days to discuss the upward manipulation of Carbide stock.The WATS line records indicated no such calls were made. O'Connorsaid she overheard the calls.   Records for regular phone lines also did not indicate that thecalls were made.   Also, Jefferies' testimony was contradicted during the secondtrial and Liman in his closing arguments said Jefferies' testimonywas ``filled with inconsistencies and contradictions.''   Sherwin faces up to 40 years in prison and up to $2 million infines, but his sentence is expected to be far less than themaximum. GAF could be fined up to $4 million.</TEXT></DOC>
