In Seoul, the dollar fell a record 2.2 South Korean won against the government-managed currency to a new low of 819 won, the Bank of Korea said. The won-dollar rate has been a sore point between Washington and Seoul, with the Reagan administration pressuring South Korea to let its currency appreciate to help ease the U.S. trade deficit with that country.    The South Korean central bank said the won has risen 4.92% this year, compared with a 3.2% increase in all of 1986. South Korea has indicated it won't agree to more than a 10% appreciation this year. The U.S. reportedly wants a sharper rise.    A higher won tends to make South Korean products more expensive and less competitive abroad. Last year, the U.S. had a $7.3 billion trade deficit with South Korea.    The dollar traded lower all day against major European currencies and the Japanese yen. But it got a slight lift from comments by White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker about this week's seven-nation summit.    &quot;I think there will be important news coming out of this summit,&quot; the chief of staff said. The remark contrasted with other comments by administration officials indicating that the meeting will yield little more than a reaffirmation of a commitment to keep exchange rates stable.    Earlier yesterday, the dollar weakened after U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker said he didn't expect any new initiative concerning the dollar to come from the talks involving leaders of the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada.    President Reagan removed some of the punitive tariffs yesterday that he had placed on certain Japanese imports in April, and traders said this eased some negative sentiment toward the dollar. The action, which had been expected, reduces the risk of a U.S.-Japanese trade war, Shigeru Tokunaga, vice president and foreign exchange manager at Fuji Bank Ltd.'s New York branch, said. &quot;It's good news for Japan and the U.S.,&quot; he said.    The dollar, however, was unable to climb out of negative territory for the day. In late New York trading, the U.S. currency stood at 143.60 Japanese yen, higher than its intraday low of 142.49 but still down 0.3% from 143.98 Friday. The dollar also fell 0.7% to 1.8050 West German marks from 1.8179. A holiday in most major continental European markets further slowed trading.    In early trading today in Tokyo, the dollar was quoted at 142.75 yen.    Traders generally have low expectations for the seven-nation Venice meeting.    &quot;I don't think too many people . . . expect anything to take the dollar a whole lot higher,&quot; Michael J. Duffy, vice president and chief trader at European American Bank in New York, said.    However, he said, traders are keeping a low profile in the foreign exchange market while the summit continues.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell $4.30 an ounce to $449.50 in moderate trading. Estimated volume was three million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $452.25 an ounce in early trading today in Hong Kong.    ---                    LATE NEW YORK TRADING                     Monday, June 8, 1987    Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
