Separately, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission -- while giving a passing grade to the Merc's enforcement procedures in a periodic review -- said the exchange needs to pursue rogue traders more diligently and speed its investigations.    A Merc disciplinary committee alleged that Bryan and Denise Bigelow helped another Merc member skirt his employer's ban on trading stock-index futures for the member's own account from April 1985 to July 1986. They also helped divert profits that belonged to the employer to the other Merc member during the period, the committee alleged.    The Bigelows agreed to the disciplinary action without admitting or denying the allegations. They also paid an undisclosed amount to the employer affected as restitution. The exchange didn't fine the traders.    Robert Vanasco, the Bigelows' lawyer, said &quot;none of the alleged trades involved public customers.&quot; He wouldn't elaborate on the allegations and said Mr. and Mrs. Bigelow declined to comment.    Futures industry attorneys and officials familiar with the case said the unidentified member aided by the Bigelows is Jeffrey Donnelly, whom the Merc expelled and fined $100,000 earlier this year, alleging abusive trades.    Mr. Donnelly, as previously reported, is a subject of a federal grand jury probe into the allegations of trading abuses, industry attorneys and officials said. They said it wasn't clear if Mr. and Mrs. Bigelow, or any other stock-index futures traders, were also subjects of the federal inquiry.    Mr. Donnelly couldn't be reached for comment.    The CFTC, the federal regulator overseeing futures exchanges, reviewed the Merc's disciplinary activities from July 1 through Dec. 31, 1986. The commission extended the study through April 1, 1987, specifically to examine disciplinary actions tied to the exchange's Standard andamp; Poor's 500 stock-index futures pit, which has been the subject of widespread allegations of trading abuses.    Among the Merc's shortcomings highlighted in the report, the CFTC said, was the exchange's failure to take action against a non-member for alleged abuses in stock-index futures trading, even though the Merc had authority to do so. The commission also cited an instance when the exchange didn't discipline a member who admitted trading currency futures after the close of trading.    The CFTC said the Merc should hire more disciplinary staff members to keep abreast of its rapidly growing markets, particularly the Sandamp;P 500 pit. It also gave the exchange until Sept. 1 to submit a written plan for speeding its investigations of suspected trading infractions.    A Merc spokesman said the problems cited in the &quot;generally very positive report&quot; from the CFTC &quot;are being addressed or already have been addressed.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
