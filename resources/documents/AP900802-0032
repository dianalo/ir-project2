Izvestia celebrated the occassion by publishing a photograph ofGlavlit's approval stamp on its front page.   That minor act of rebellion marked a watershed day in thegradual freeing of speech since Mikhail S. Gorbachev came to powerin 1985.   ``The press and other mass media are free'' and ``censorship ofthe mass media is forbidden,'' says the new law passed by theSupreme Soviet legislature in June after months of debate.   Editors said in their news pages that the new legal guaranteeswon't stop attempts at interference overnight. The new law does notabolish Glavlit, which stands for the Main Administration forSafeguarding State Secrets in the Press. Glavlit will still havethe power to censor articles construed as calling for the violentoverthrow of the government, promoting racial or religiousintolerance, or publishing propaganda for war, violence or cruelty.   In addition, the shortage of newsprint and its increasing costscould be a major barrier for independent publications.   The most daring editors have been pushing the limits ofGorbachev's policy of glasnost, or openness, since he came to power.   Tass, the official government news agency, already has acompetitor in Interfax, a news service set up by Radio Moscow lastyear to earn hard currency. Sent to subscribers by facsimilemachine, Interfax quickly earned a place on the pages of worldnewspapers with scoops like Gorbachev's plan to ask the CommunistParty to give up its monopoly on power.   The government's Novosti press agency chose Wednesday toannounce that it is being transformed from a propaganda-publishinginstitution to an ``information agency,'' albeit one dedicated toreporting on Gorbachev's reform policy, called perestroika.   ``It is felt that Tass and the daily newspapers must advise onthe events of the day, so we are obligated to integrate morefacts'' into our work, said Novosti chairman Albert Vlasov inIzvestia on Wednesday.   Just two weeks ago, Gorbachev issued a decree loosening controlson the state television monopoly. Until then, only groups approvedby a state committee had access to Soviet television, and as aresult the Communist party received large segments of air time.   The decree said no one party or group should monopolize air time.   Some of the most dramatic changes are in the works at the feistyweekly Moscow News, which is planning to go independent of Novosti,selling stock, ads and subscriptions.   Seven years ago, it was a multilingual propaganda sheet, knownfor articles that claimed 12 million people were starving in theUnited States. Now its weekly thrust into forbidden territory hasmade it one of the most popular newspapers in the country.   But its faithful readers must crowd around the copies posted onthe newspaper's wall in downtown Moscow because it has been barredfrom selling subscriptions for its Russian-language edition insidethe Soviet Union.   Editor Yegor Yakovlev announced in this week's edition that thenewspaper will ignore the restrictions and start a subscriptiondrive in hopes of earning enough to pay for the additional,extremely scarce newsprint.   Tass reported Wednesday that market reforms are bringing anabrupt jump in the price of newsprint and printing services. Itpredicted that the retail price of most publications will doubleand that many of them will die off.   To establish a new publication or news organization, the new lawsays Soviets need only provide their name, address, frequency ofpublication, circulation figures and source of financing.   Journalists' new rights include the right to attend meetings andbe present at the scene of disasters, the right to refuse toprepare reports that go against a journalist's convictions, and theright to hold interviews with officials. They now can withdrawtheir byline if the contents of a story are distorted by editing.</TEXT></DOC>
