Gottschalk Jr. (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> HENG </CO><IN> ERN </IN><DATELINE> LA JOLLA, Calif.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Henley Group Inc., citing investment losses and higher interest expense, posted a fourth-quarter net loss of $197 million.    In the year-earlier period, the manufacturing, engineering and financial services concern reported a net loss of $354 million. Revenue rose 4.6% to $863 million from $825 million.    For 1987, Henley narrowed its net loss to $278 million, compared with a net loss of $426 million in 1986. For the year, revenue rose 11% to $3.51 billion from $3.17 million.    The fourth-quarter and full-year losses reflected investment losses totaling $112 million for the fourth quarter and $102 million for the year, the company said. Higher interest expense from additional borrowings for the acquisition of 15.1 million shares of Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp., common stock buy-backs and other investments also affected earnings, the company said.    Henley is involved in a contest to acquire Santa Fe Southern Pacific.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Henley's stock closed at $25, up 87.5 cents.    The amortization of good will, which originated with predecessor companies' purchase of many businesses that became Henley units, also contributed to the losses, a company spokesman said. Good will is the excess of a company's purchase price over its real asset value, and it is charged to earnings over a number of years. Henley became a public company in May, 1986. </TEXT></DOC>
