But exercising those options isoften costly and, for many executives, can mean embarrassingpublic disclosure of their stock trades.   In January, most public companies and many Wall Streetfirms will set annual compensation and allocate stock grantsor other perks, says Joseph P. Kane, a first vice presidentat Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. At some companies, &quot;there's alot of talk of no bonuses,&quot; and executives may get stockoptions instead, he says.</LP><TEXT>   Stock options give executives the right to buy companystock during a specified period of time at a stipulatedexercise price. That price is normally at or below thestock's fair-market value at the time the option is granted.   Options are a good deal if the company does well, and themarket price of its stock rises. Moreover, because of achange in Securities and Exchange Commission regulations thattook effect last May, officers, directors and other&quot;insiders&quot; can exercise options and sell the shares morequickly and easily than they could earlier.   But options become all but useless if the stock is belowthe exercise price, putting the options &quot;under water.&quot; So,for many executives, a gift of company options is atheoretical windfall at best.   Consider International Business Machines Corp.'s chairman,John F. Akers. Under options granted him since 1983, Mr.Akers can purchase about 430,000 shares of IBM stock atprices ranging from $96.69 to $159.50 a share, according tofilings with the SEC. Unfortunately for Mr. Akers, the stockof the giant computer hasn't been doing very well lately; itclosed closed yesterday at $85.50, down $1.375, in New YorkStock Exchange late trading.   Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee Iacocca is in the same boat.His options to purchase over 1.8 million shares of stock areexercisable at $12.42 to $33.50 a share, according to thecompany. The stock closed at $10.50, down 25 cents, on theBig Board.   For executives, directors and major shareholders who meetthe legal definition of an &quot;insider,&quot; exercising stockoptions, and selling the stock, is done in the public eye.Insiders, loosely defined as those in a policy-making role ata company, are required to file all their stock transactionswith the SEC.   This trading by corporate insiders shouldn't be confusedwith the &quot;insider trading&quot; committed in the recent WallStreet scandals, which involved abuse of confidential ormisappropriated information. Most insider trading isperfectly legal, so long as reporting requirements are met.But investors study the insider filings for a clue to acompany's business outlook and the direction of its stock; alarge sale by an official, or several insiders selling atonce, can be interpreted as a sign of a lack of faith in thecompany.   What executive perks are stock options replacing?Companies are phasing out stock appreciation rights (SARs),which were often given in tandem with options, and grants ofrestricted stock. With SARs, no initial investment by theemployee is required. The employee realizes the appreciationin the value of specified number of shares without having topurchase or hold the shares.   Similarly, in a restricted stock grant, shares of stockare granted to executive without cost or at a bargain price,subject to the restriction that they are not sold or disposedof for a specified period of time.   Companies are increasingly trying &quot;to wean executives offthe use of stock appreciation rights&quot; because SARs &quot;arecharged as a compensation expense on the company's incomestatement,&quot; says Paula Todd, principal at benefits consultingfirm Towers Perrin. Outright stock grants, on the other hand,are losing ground as shareholder groups oppose what lookslike expensive giveaways to management.   In a survey of 70 large industrial and financial companiesby Hewitt Associates, a Lincolnshire, Ill., employee-benefitsconsulting firm, 40% of the companies currently offered stockappreciation rights to officers and directors. But only fourof those companies said they will continue to grant SARs toexecutives.   American Brands Inc., Old Greenwich, Conn., didn't offerSARs to key executives this year for the first time inseveral years, says a company spokesman. In light of the newSEC regulations, he says, SARs were &quot;less attractive.&quot;   The SEC rules take away much of the market risk forexecutives in exercising options. The rules eliminate amandatory six-month holding period between the exercise ofoptions and the sale of the resulting stock. The regulationsstill require a six-month wait, but the clock now startsrunning when the options are granted.   To make stock options more accessible and attractivecompensation for executives, American Brands, like severalother companies, has set up a cashless-exercise program.Through these programs, firms essentially lend executives themoney needed to exercise company-granted options, thenimmediately sell all or most of the shares. Transaction feesand taxes are subtracted from the proceeds, and theexecutives receive the remainder. Major brokerage firms alsohave plans available to individual executives under which thefirms lend money to exercise company-granted options and thenhandle the sale of the resulting shares.   But, while these programs are gaining ground, they canalso be controversial. Some shareholder groups complain thatcashless exercises work against the best interests ofcompanies and their stockholders by discouraging long-termstock ownership by executives.</TEXT></DOC>
