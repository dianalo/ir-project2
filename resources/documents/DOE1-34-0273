Five tasks were defined to accomplishthe project objective: (1) Characterization of Biomass, (2) Biomass HandlingCharacteristics, (3) Bench-Scale Experiments, (4) Process Research Unit(PRU) Tests, and (5) Data Review for Process Scale-Up and Economic Assessment.The results obtained from the first three tasks were used to design andconstruct a 12-in. diameter fluidized bed gasifier PRU. Experiments havebeen conducted in the PRU at pressure up to 345 psig and through putsup to 925 lb/h (moisture-free basis). These experiments have evaluatedthe effects of temperature, pressure, wood, steam feed rates, moisture,bed height, and feedstock type on gasifier performance and gas yieldand quality. A three-day continuous test was also completed to evaluatelong-term effects on gasifier performance.</TEXT></DOC>
