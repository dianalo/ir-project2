(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Drawn by adventure and hopes of bigprofits, Florida's 238 newly licensed alligator hunters are gettingready to begin the state's first legal gator hunt in 26 years.   More than 5,000 novice and skilled hunters alike scrambled toapply for the permits after game officials announced the hunt,designed to trim an alligator population that was once threatenedby poachers but is now an estimated at 1 million.   Wide-eyed amateurs will be stalking freshwater swamps, lakes andstreams with hopes of cashing in on their catch, which can bring asmuch as $1,000 for a 10-foot gator's skin and meat.   But some experts are wondering if the permit holders really knowwhat they're in for.   ``You got to laugh when you hear these people say they're goingto make money off this hunt,'' said 37-year-old Dale Dunaway, whooperates one of Florida's few alligator processing plants.   ``They don't figure in the time, expenses _ and don't forget thedanger,'' Dunaway said Tuesday. ``I'd like to see some people'sfaces the first time a gator takes a bite at their airboat.   For 30 days beginning at sunset Thursday, the randomly selectedpermit holders will be allowed to hunt in designated areas wherethe gator population is extraordinarily high.   Waterfront residents all over Florida called for a hunt againstthe carnivorous reptiles after a 10{-foot bull gator killed4-year-old Erin Glover in the Gulf Coast community of Englewood inJune.   But game officials have placed tight restrictions on the hunt.Permit holders will be working at night, when flashlights make thereptiles' eyes glow eerily red. And they are not allowed to useguns, relying on clubs, traps and hooks attached to poles.   The harvest is limited to up to 3,435 gators, with each hunterlimited to 15 gators each.   ``We expect to be up non-stop from Thursday until about Monday,either skinning or hunting,'' Dunaway said at his 2-year-oldprocessing operation in this remote southwest Florida town. ``We'regonna be looking at a lot of dead gators.''   Skinning an average alligator is a full day's work, Dunawayreckons.   First he plunges his hunting knife through the gator's thickhide at the tip of its tail. Then, it's a slow and difficult cut tothe snout.   ``You got to look at it as an hour a foot to properly skin andgut a gator,'' said Dunaway. ``There's no way around it. It's hardwork, you bet.''   Some of the experienced hunters will be permitted to use theequipment at the gator house, a cement frame enclosed by screenwire and decorated by deer antlers.   But the novice trappers will have to sit and watch their catchbe pried apart.   Alligators are cut up the back to preserve the valuable hidecovering the belly and underarms, said Dunaway. The hide, whichsells for about $42 a foot to foreign manufacturers, is submergedin a brine solution for about a week.   The excess flesh is then scraped off and the skin is sun dried.   ``And we bury the innards as far away as possible,'' saidDunaway. ``They got a powerful smell and if you ever cut open thestomach you better start running.''   The meat, which Dunaway says makes a nice addition to spaghettisauce, must be frozen within hours after the alligator is killed.One 12-foot gator bought to the plant in 1986 yielded 230 pounds ofmeat.   ``You're fixing to eat gator for a long time with a catch likethat,'' said Dunaway's 24-year-old brother, Grant.   Yet the gator business is just a hobby for the Dunaways andtheir uncle William Busby, 36. All will take vacation time fromtheir jobs to process the gators.   They say the best they can do charging a $30 fee and $2 a poundis break even.   ``We just like it out here with the gators,'' said Grant.</TEXT></DOC>
