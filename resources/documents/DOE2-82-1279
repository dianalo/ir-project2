<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-82-1279 </DOCNO><TEXT>Details are given on different analytical methods assessing the energydemand of refrigerators and heating systems. An account of the basicrequirements, strong and weak points of each of the methods presentedis followed by a comparative evaluation of the analytical results expectedfor buildings and systems. The criteria used to evaluate the methodsinclude the conditions assumed, the practicability of analyses, the datarequired, the accuracy of cooling and heating load calculations, theaccuracy of system performance data, the sensitivity to kWh pricing structures,the profits experienced users can derive, and standard building/systemapplications. Among the methods presented are incremental hourly analyses,simplified hourly analyses, BIN methods and simplified BIN methods. Thereport will be continued. (HWJ).</TEXT></DOC>
