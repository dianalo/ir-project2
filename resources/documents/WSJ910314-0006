Aspreviously reported, life insurers face an $8 billion taxincrease over the next five years under that tax package, acost they have said they plan to pass on to theirpolicyholders through lower dividends.   Robert Hill, executive vice president, said the companywill cut its dividends to roughly 16 million policyholdersfrom $2.42 last year to $2.35 billion, including dividends togroup life insurance policyholders. Before the tax increasethe insurer had planned to pay policyholders dividends 8%higher than last year, Mr. Hill said.   Dividends to holders of individual life insurance willtotal $1.78 billion this year, he said, compared with $1.817billion last year. Holders of term life insurance willprobably be hit hardest, he said, while holders of some typesof policies, such as whole life, may see increases in theirdividends, he said.   Prudential made a similar cut of around $35 million in itsdividend in 1989, he said.   The company also said its surplus, a rough approximationof earnings for a mutual life insurer, rose 13%, from $4.8billion to $5.4 billion.
