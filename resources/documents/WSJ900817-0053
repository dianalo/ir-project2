The petition, which involves Exxon's income taxes for theyears 1980 through 1982, was filed yesterday in the U.S. TaxCourt in Washington. Exxon expects the litigation to go totrial sometime next year. The company also said that althoughit expects to prevail in court, it has put aside reservesthat it called &quot;adequate&quot; to cover any potential liabilities.</LP><TEXT>   The major issue, Exxon officials say, involves the pricingof crude bought from Saudi Arabia from 1980 through 1982. Theoil giant is already in court over a $500 million tax claimalso involving Saudi purchases dating back to 1979. Thepetition filed yesterday consolidates the two actions.   Exxon said that $1.5 billion of the $6.5 billion beingsought by the government for those years reflects the disputeover the pricing of Saudi oil. Counting the 1979 claim, thatbrings the total claims relating to that issue to $2 billion.   The company said it is resisting another $5 billion invarious other IRS claims for the 1980-82 period, includingattempts to disallow such items as standard depreciation andforeign tax credits. Exxon said it has supplied theappropriate documents to support such credits anddepreciation, but said the federal agency is contending ithasn't had adequate time to complete its review. The auditstarted 2 1/2 years ago.   IRS officials declined to comment on the case, saying theyhadn't seen the petition.   Between 1979 and 1981, oil prices soared to as high as $40a barrel on the spot market as a result of the chaosfollowing the Iranian revolution. The Saudis, partly at therequest of the U.S. government, increased their output andsold oil at prices below market. Official Saudi sellingprices in the period never broke $34 a barrel.   The Internal Revenue Service alleges that during thoseyears, several oil companies made enormous profits buyingsuch relatively low-priced oil from Saudi Arabia and turningit into products sold at market prices. The chiefbeneficiaries were the U.S. shareholders of theSaudi-American consortium called Arabian American Oil Co. --Exxon, Texaco Inc., Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. The abilityof those companies to buy cheap Saudi crude was referred toas the &quot;Aramco Advantage&quot; by the industry.   Exxon, and presumably the others, resold the bulk of theSaudi oil to U.S. and foreign affiliates at the officialSaudi price, industry sources say. The kingdom wouldn't allowthe companies to reap windfall profits by reselling the oilat higher market prices. The companies refined the crude andsold the resulting products at market prices in the U.S. aswell as overseas.   The four U.S. companies were in a position to profitgreatly from the arrangement through the sale of the refinedproducts because the crude was costing them less than theircompetitors. But Exxon's general tax counsel, William D.O'Brien, yesterday contested such allegations, saying thatthe savings were passed on to consumers. He also said thatappropriate taxes regarding those sales were paid to bothU.S. and foreign governments.   Exxon Chairman Lawrence G. Rawl in a statement yesterdaycalled IRS claims for back taxes &quot;totally unwarranted.&quot; Hemaintained that Saudi Arabia would have refused to sell thecrude to the oil majors if they had violated its directiveprohibiting them from reselling the oil at the higher marketprices. And consumers in the end would have ended up payingeven higher prices than they did, he said.   But the IRS has refused to budge. So, Texaco, as well asExxon, is currently preparing to go to trial to fight similarclaims by the agency. The IRS claims that Texaco owes about$1.8 billion in back taxes and interest to the federalgovernment for the years 1979 through 1981. Neither Mobil norChevron are involved in litigation with the agency at thistime.</TEXT></DOC>
