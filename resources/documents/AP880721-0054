But her letter to TexasTreasurer Ann Richards got a personal response on nationaltelevision.   ``I felt kind of embarrassed a little bit,'' said Ms. Alexander,who watched the Monday night keynote speech while wrapping up aTupperware party at her home in Lorena, Texas.   In her speech, Ms. Richards quoted at length from Ms.Alexander's letter to her about the difficulties faced by averagefamilies. The letter was written on a lunch break after Ms.Alexander heard that families would be the key note in the keynotespeech.   ``For a number of years, I've wondered if people like us are theforgotten,'' she wrote. ``We're not the poor and we're not therich. We're not the very young or the aged. We're the averageAmerican family.''   The Alexanders earn about $50,000 a year and have difficultymaking ends meet for themselves and their three children, she said.She is an administrator at a mental retardation treatment facility.Her husband Joe is a telephone installer.   Ms. Alexander, 39, said she was inspired last year after hearingMs. Richards speak at a meeting of mental retardation professionals.   ``It was like sitting ay my coffee table talking with somebodyover a cup of coffee, like she was speaking right to me. She was sodynamic, yet so warm. I knew right then I had found a new hero,''Ms. Alexander said Wednesday in a telephone interview.   She gave Ms. Richards permission to quote from the letter, butonly if her name would not be used.   ``When the word Lorena came on, everybody was surprised ... Myknees were weak. Here was my hero talking straight at me,'' shesaid.   ``It's been a long time since I had a hero,'' she added, callingJohn and Robert Kennedy her last heroes.   ``I was shocked that she used so much of the letter,'' Ms.Alexander said. ``I hope it makes people aware of what's happeningin middle-class America.''   Among the things happening to middle-class America is thatfamilies are too busy to play active roles in politics, she said.This year, for the first time since she has been eligible, Ms.Alexander did not vote in the Texas presidential primary.   ``The day just went by and I didn't get it done,'' she saidapologetically.</TEXT></DOC>
