Background </ITAG>Pursuant to Public Law (P.L.) 97-415, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission(the Commission) is publishing this regular biweekly notice. P.L. 97-415revised section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act),to require the Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued, orproposed to be issued, under a new provision of section 189 of the Act.This provision grants the Commission the authority to issue and make immediatelyeffective any amendment to an operating license upon a determination bythe Commission that such amendment involves no significant hazards consideration,notwithstanding the pendency before the Commission of a request for a hearingfrom any person. This biweekly notice includes all notices of amendments issued, or proposedto be issued from November 6, 1989 through November 16, 1989. The lastbiweekly notice was published on November 15, 1989 (54 FR 47598). <ITAG tagnum="84">NOTICE OF CONSIDERATION OF ISSUANCE OF AMENDMENT TO FACILITY OPERATINGLICENSE AND PROPOSED NO SIGNIFICANT HAZARDS CONSIDERATION DETERMINATIONAND OPPORTUNITY FOR HEARING </ITAG>The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following amendmentrequests involve no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission'sregulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facilityin accordance with the proposed amendments would not (1) involve a significantincrease in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated;or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reductionin a margin of safety. The basis for this proposed determination for eachamendment request is shown below. The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination.Any comments received within 30 days after the date of publication of thisnotice will be considered in making any final determination. The Commissionwill not normally make a final determination unless it receives a requestfor a hearing. Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Regulatory PublicationsBranch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Officeof Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,and should cite the publication date and page number of this <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice. Written comments may also be deliveredto Room P-223, Phillips Building, 7920 Norfolk Avenue, Bethesda, Marylandfrom 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Copies of written comments received may beexamined at the NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street,NW., Washington, DC. The filing of requests for hearing and petitions forleave to intervene is discussed below. By December 29, 1989, the licensee may file a request for a hearing withrespect to issuance of the amendment to the subject facility operatinglicense and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceedingand who wishes to participate as a party in the proceeding must file awritten petition for leave to intervene. Requests for a hearing and petitionsfor leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's``Rules of Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714 whichis available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building,2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555 and at the Local Public DocumentRoom for the particular facility involved. If a request for a hearing orpetition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commissionor an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission orby the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will ruleon the request and/or petition and the Secretary or the designated AtomicSafety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriateorder. As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall setforth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceeding,and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding.The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention shouldbe permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) thenature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to theproceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial,or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of anyorder which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest.The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subjectmatter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Anyperson who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has beenadmitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave ofthe Board up to fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfythe specificity requirements described above. Not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file a supplement to thepetition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions whichare sought to be litigated in the matter. Each contention must consistof a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the basesof the contention and a concise statement of the alleged facts or expertopinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intendsto rely in proving the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must alsoprovide references to those specific sources and documents of which thepetitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establishthose facts or expert opinion. Petitioner must provide sufficient informationto show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a materialissue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within thescope of the amendments under consideration. The contention must be onewhich, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitionerwho fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirementswith respect to at least one contention will not be permitted to participateas a party. Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subjectto any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene, and have theopportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, includingthe opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determinationon the issue of no significant hazards consideration. The final determinationwill serve to decide when the hearing is held. If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significanthazards consideration, the Commission may issue the amendment and makeit immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Anyhearing held would take place after issuance of the amendment. If the final determination is that the amendment involves a significanthazards consideration, any hearing held would take place before the issuanceof any amendment. Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expirationof the 30-day notice period. However, should circumstances change duringthe notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result,for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission mayissue the license amendment before the expiration of the 30-day noticeperiod, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involvesno significant hazards consideration. The final determination will considerall public and State comments received before action is taken. Should theCommission take this action, it will publish a notice of issuance and providefor opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects thatthe need to take this action will occur very infrequently. A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filedwith the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Service Branch, or may bedelivered to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building,2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC, by the above date. Where petitionsare filed during the last ten (10) days of the notice period, it is requestedthat the petitioner promptly so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephonecall to Western Union at 1-(800) 325-6000 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700).The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number3737 and the following message addressed to (<T3>Project Director</T3>): petitioner's name and telephone number; datepetition was mailed; plant name; and publication date and page number ofthis <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice. A copy of the petition should also besent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee. Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions,supplemental petitions and/or requests for hearing will not be entertainedabsent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or thepresiding Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, that the petition and/or requestshould be granted based upon a balancing of factors specified in 10 CFR2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d). For further details with respect to this action, see the application foramendment which is available for public inspection at the Commission'sPublic Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,DC, and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved.<ITAG tagnum="84">Commonwealth Edison Company, Docket Nos. 50-237 and 50-249, DresdenNuclear Power Station, Units 2 and 3, Grundy County, Illinois </ITAG><T3>Date of application for amendments: </T3>October 30, 1989 <T3>Description of amendments request: </T3>Currently, the Dresden NuclearPower Station (DNPS), Units 2 and 3, Technical Specifications (TS) do includecycle-specific and fuel bundle type specific power distribution operatinglimits. Typically, in the past, changes to these limits would be submittedfor NRC approval prior to each refueling outage to reflect upcoming cycle-specificcharacteristics. Since these limits were determined using a methodologypreviously approved by the NRC, license amendments were an unnecessaryburden on the utility and NRC resources. In order to facilitate the eliminationof these unnecessary amendments, the NRC issued Generic Letter 88-16, ``Removalof Cycle-Specific Parameter Limits from Technical Specifications.'' ThisGeneric Letter provides guidance in removing the cycle-specific and fuelbundle-specific operating limits from the TS and recording them in a CoreOperating Limits Report (COLR). Commonwealth Edison Company (CECo) proposeda TS amendment for DNPS in accordance with Generic Letter 88-16 and thepreviously approved lead Boiling Water Reactor (BWR) Plant (Brunswick).CECo's proposed TS amendment removes the following cycle-specific and fuelbundle type specific operating limits: Average Planar Linear Heat GenerationRate, Minimum Critical Power Ratio, Linear Heat Generation Rate, and RodBlock Monitor Upscale Setpoints. In place of these limits, the applicableTS sections will reference the COLR. The COLR is an unit specific documentcontaining the power distribution operating limits that apply for a specificcycle. COLRs for future operating cycles will be submitted to the NRC for informationprior to startup following each refueling outage as required by GenericLetter 88-16. The implementation and revision of the COLRs will be controlledby DNPS Administrative Procedures. It should be noted that COLR revisionswill receive the same level of detailed review and required approvals bythe CECo Nuclear Fuel Services (NFS) Department, and On-Site and Off-SiteReview Committees as Technical Specification changes do. In addition, theDefinitions Section of the Technical Specifications shall have an entryentitled, ``Core Operating Limits Report,'' and there will be a new administrativereporting requirement added to the existing reporting requirements in Section6.6.A of the Technical Specifications. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission provided standards for determining whether a no significanthazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(C). A proposed amendmentto an operating license involves no significant hazards consideration ifoperation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment wouldnot: (1) involve a significant increase in the probability of consequencesof an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of anew or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated;or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. CECo reviewed the proposed changes to the TS and determined that the requestedamendment does not involve a significant hazards consideration. More specifically,operation of DNPS in accordance with the proposed amendment: <ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Does not involve a significant increase in the probability orconsequences, of any accident previously evaluated because plant protectivefunctions and modes of operation are not altered. This amendment removescycle-specific and fuel bundle type specific power distribution limitsfrom the Technical Specifications and places them in a separate, controlleddocument (i.e., COLR). These changes are essentially administrative innature, as the parameters in the COLR are the same as those currently specifiedin the Technical Specifications. NRC approved methods will still be usedto analyze reloads of NRC approved fuel types for determining the resultsreported in the COLR. The surveillance requirements for these operatinglimits remain unchanged. Furthermore, functional requirements of safety-relatedequipment remain uneffected. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Does not create the possibility of a new or different kind ofaccident from any accident previously evaluated because as stated aboveno safety-related equipment, safety function, plant protective feature,or mode of operation will be altered as a result of this amendment. Theproposed changes do not create any new type of accident. The proposed amendmentis in accordance with the guidance provided in Generic Letter 88-16 forlicensees requesting removal of the values of cycle-specific parametersfrom the TS. These operating limits will be developed in accordance withNRC-approved methodology, and the incorporation of these limits to theCOLR ensure they will be properly controlled. Furthermore, the TS requirementfor submitting the COLR to the Commission will allow the staff to continueto trend the value of these limits without the need for prior staff approvaland without introduction of an unreviewed safety question. The currentspectrum of analyzed reactor transients and accidents remains unchanged.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.No plant functions are changed by this amendment. The change only removescycle-specific and fuel bundle type specific power distribution limitsfrom the Technical Specifications and incorporates these limits in theCOLR. The plant will still continue to be operated within the boundariesestablished by these same power distribution limits as calculated usingNRC approved methods. </ITAG>The Commission conducted a preliminary review of CECo's proposed amendmentand analysis of no significant hazards. Currently, the Commission concurswith CECo's determination, and proposes that the aforementioned amendmentdoes not constitute a significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Morris Public Library, 604Liberty Street, Morris, Illinois 60450. <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Michael L.

Craig <ITAG tagnum="84">Consumers Power Company, Docket No. 50-255, Palisades Plant, Van BurenCounty, Michigan </ITAG><T3>Date of amendment request: </T3>September 2, 1988 <T3>Description of amendment request: </T3>The proposed amendment wouldrevise the provisions in the Technical Specifications to incorporate operabilityand surveillance requirements for core exit thermocouples (CET). A newspecification and several applicable footnotes would be added to Table3.17.4 establishing minimum CET operability requirements, permissible bypassconditions, and compensatory actions to be taken in the event of CET inoperability.A new item would also be added to Table 4.1.3 specifying periodic surveillancerequirements for the CET. In addition, the licensee proposes to reviseBasis paragraph 3.17 to reflect the above described changes. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendmentinvolves no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulationsin 10 CFR 50.92, this means that the operation of the facility in accordancewith the proposed amendment would not: (1) Involve a significant increasein the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated;or (2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany accident previously evaluated; or (3) Involve a significant reductionin a margin of safety. The Commission has evaluated the proposed changes against the above standardsas required by 10 CFR 50.91(a) and has concluded that: The changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability orconsequences of an accident previously evaluated (10 CFR 50.92(c)(1)) becausethe proposed changes merely add operability and surveillance requirementsfor the upgraded core exit thermocouples (CETs) where none had existedpreviously. The upgraded CETs are environmentally qualified thermocoupleswith increased indicating range and improve the operators' ability to monitorcore temperatures following an accident. The changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind ofaccident from any accident previously evaluated (10 CFR 50.92(c)(2)) becausethey do not affect the manner by which the facility is operated. The proposedchanges merely add operability and surveillance requirements for the upgradedcore exit thermocouples (CETs) where none had existed previously. The changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety(10 CFR 50.92(c)(3)) because the proposed changes do not affect the mannerby which the facility is operated or involve equipment or features whichaffect the operational characteristics of the facility. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Van Zoeren Library, HopeCollege, Holland, Michigan 49423. <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Judd L.

The amendment would specify the time limits during whichthe diesel generator fuel oil can be allowed out of specifications (3.8.1.1.a,b and d). New requirements would be imposed requiring periodic removalof water from the diesel fuel tank, sampling of new fuel oil in accordancewith industry test standard documents, and periodic testing of stored fueloil. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists in accordance with 10 CFR 50.92(c). A proposedamendment to an operating license for a facility involves no significanthazard consideration if operation of the facility in accordance with theproposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in theprobability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated, (2) createthe possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accidentpreviously evaluated, or (3) involve a significant reduction in a marginof safety. The new diesel oil specifications comply with current guidance documentsand do not reduce the level of diesel generator operability. The new requirementscannot function as initiating events of any previously analyzed accidents.Furthermore, we determined that despite the proposed changes to the TechnicalSpecifications, the original design requirement of the system will continueto be met, and safety-related systems which require power supply from thediesel generators will be capable of performing their original design functions.Hence the probability and consequences of previously analyzed accidentswill not be increased. There is no hardware, software or operational procedurechanges as a result of the proposed amendment, and hence no new failuremodes are introduced. Finally, there is no change in any analytical assumptionor acceptance criteria. We therefore propose to determine that the requested amendment involvesno significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>B. F.

The purpose of the above specifications would be to preclude reactivitytransients when isolated RCS loops are to be restarted. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists in accordance with 10 CFR 50.92(c). A proposedamendment to an operating license for a facility involves no significanthazards consideration if operation of the facility in accordance with theproposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in theprobability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated, (2) createthe possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accidentpreviously evaluated, or (3) involve a significant reduction in a marginof safety. The above changes affect requirements that are not initiators of previouslyanalyzed accidents, and not contributors to consequences of previouslyanalyzed accidents; the answer to the first criterion is thus negative.The above requirements all seek to assure, through administrative controls,that minimum shutdown margins are available to prevent accidents from occurring;all accidents attributed to loss of shutdown margin have been previouslyanalyzed and the new requirements cannot result in new accidents. Hencethe answer to criterion (2) is also negative. Finally, there will be nochanges to safety analysis assumptions and acceptance criteria, and hencethe answer to the third criterion is also negative. The staff therefore proposes to determine that the requested amendmentinvolves no significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>B. F.

The pumps in these systemsare not safety-graded, and thus have no need to follow the monthly Class1, 2 and 3 test schedule. (2) Specification 4.7.8.1.b, regarding testing frequency of the SupplementalLeak Collection and Release System (SLCRS) would be clarified by replacing``and'' with ``or'' so that the conditions that would require testing canbe more easily met. The current test frequency is non-conservative comparedto the proposed frequency. (3) Specifications 3.7.9.1 and 4.7.9.1.1 on sealed sources would be revisedto comply with the requirements of the Standard Technical Specifications.(4) Basis section 3/4.9.1 and 3/4.9.13 regarding the Unit 1 fuel buildingventilation system would be revised to correct an error. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists in accordance with 10 CFR 50.92(c). A proposedamendment to an operating license for a facility involves no significanthazards consideration if operation of the facility in accordance with theproposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in theprobability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated, (2) createthe possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accidentpreviously evaluated, or (3) involve a significant reduction in a marginof safety. Change (1) affects the test frequency of a non-safety system which hasno part in any accident scenarios. Change (2) would increase the test frequencyof the SLCRS, a safety system, and hence improves its assurance of operability.The SLCRS mitigates consequences of accidents; the increased test frequencyin no way decreases this function. Change (3) is not associated with anypreviously analyzed accidents, and change (4) is not part of the TechnicalSpecifications. Hence all four changes would not involve any increase inconsequences or probability of previously analyzed accidents. No hardware or operational changes are involved. Hence the changes cannotcreate the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from anypreviously evaluated. Finally, there is no proposed change in analyticalassumptions or acceptance criteria. Hence there is no reduction of anysafety margin. The staff therefore proposes to determine that the requested amendmentsinvolve no significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>B. F.

Thus, when a new core is installed, the valuesof these parameters must be changed. Such parameters are referred to as``cycle-dependent.'' Generic Letter 88-16 provided guidance on relocatingsuch parameters. This amendment would remove ``cycle-dependent'' limitsfrom the Technical Specifications (TS) and relocate them to a Core OperatingLimits Report. This report would document the specific values of parametersresulting from the licensee's calculations, including any mid-cycle revisionsto such parameters. The TS would also be revised to define and requiresuch a report. This amendment request is consistent with the guidance providedby Generic Letter 88-16. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided criteria for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists (10 CFR 50.92(c)). A proposed amendment toan operating license for a facility involves no significant hazards considerationsif operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendmentwould not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of anew or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated;or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The licensee analyzed the amendment request in light of the above threecriteria. In regard to the first criterion, the licensee determined thatthe proposed amendment would not involve a significant increase in theprobability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated becausethe requirements to operate the Crystal River Unit 3 (CR-3) plant withinthe cycle-specific core operating limits would remain in the TS. The amendmentwould merely relocate the cycle-specific limits from the TS to a Core OperatingLimits Report. Regarding the second criterion, the licensee determined that the proposedamendment would not create the possibility of a new or different kind ofaccident from any accident previously analyzed. The cycle-specific variablesand limits would continue to be calculated using approved methodologies,and the requirements to operate within these approved limits would remainin the TS. Thus, no new limit or mode of plant operation has been introduced.In regard to the third criterion, the licensee determined that the proposedamendment would not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.As stated before, both the requirement to calculate cycle-specific variablesusing approved methodologies and the requirement to have a TS ensuringthat the approved limits are followed would remain. Furthermore, the appropriatecorrective actions to be taken, should approved operating limits be violated,remain unchanged. In addition, an application for a similar amendment to the TS of Duke PowerCompany's Oconee Nuclear Station Units 1, 2, and 3 was previously approvedby the staff on January 26, 1989. The staff has conducted a preliminary evaluation of the licensee's proposedamendment and agrees that it meets the above three criteria. Furthermore,the staff believes that the proposed amendment is consistent with the guidanceprovided by Generic Letter 88-16 and with policies already establishedby the Commission. Therefore, the staff proposes to determine that theproposed amendment involves no significant hazards considerations. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Crystal River Public Library,668 N.W.

Berkow <ITAG tagnum="84">GPU Nuclear Corporation, Docket No. 50-320, Three Mile Island NuclearStation, Unit No. 2, (TMI-2), Dauphin County, Pennsylvania </ITAG><T3>Date of amendment request: </T3>December 27, 1988 <T3>Description of amendment request: </T3>The proposed amendment wouldrevise TMI-2 Operating License No. DPR-73 by modifying the Appendix A TechnicalSpecifications Section 6-3, ``Unit Staff Qualifications''. The proposedchange would resolve a potential disparity between qualifications of unitstaff personnel, required by the Appendix A Technical Specifications andthe plant conditions after defueling. Section 6.3, Unit Staff Qualifications, states that Unit Staff personnelmust comply with ANSI-N18.1 1971. ANSI-N18.1 1971 states that certain positionsof the plant staff either hold or be capable of acquiring an operator'slicense. Additionally, the ANSI standard requires that the Plant Managerposition requires either an individual or designated alternate have a SeniorReactor Operating (SRO) license or have the background required to sitfor the examination. Once defueling of TMI-2 is completed and the licensee has demonstratedthat the possibility of an inadequate criticality is precluded then thelicensee can, as allowed by the current Technical Specifications, transitionto Mode 2. In Mode 2 there will no longer be a requirement to have licensedoperators at TMI-2. The licensee has proposed adding to Section 6.3.1 the statement that duringModes 2 and 3, the requirements of ANSI-N18.1 of 1971 pertaining to unitstaff operator license qualifications not apply. The licensee asserts thatsince there will no longer be a requirement for senior reactor operatorsafter they enter Mode 2, unit staff personnel or an alternate should notbe required to have an SRO license, or be required to have the backgroundto sit for the examination. The licensee has stated that during Modes 2 and 3, GPU Nuclear will continueto apply the educational and experience requirements of ANSI-N18.1 of 1971to the TMI-2 staff with the exception of unit staff licensed operator requirementsunless specifically exempted in the Technical Specifications. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists in 10 CFR 50.92(c). A proposed amendment toan operating license for a facility in accordance with the proposed amendmentwould not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated, (2) create the possibility of a newor different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated, or(3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. TMI-2 is currently in a post-accident, cold shutdown, long-term cleanupmode. The licensee is presently engaged in the final stages of defuelingthe damaged reactor, decontaminating the facility and readying the plantfor long-term storage. As of the end of September 1989, approximately 94percent of the fuel contained in the reactor vessel has been removed. Defuelingthe facility has progressed to the regions below the location of the originalcore volume. The licensee plans to remove greater than 99% of the fuelfrom the facility. Once the licensee can demonstrate that defueling iscompleted and there is no possibility of a recriticality then the licenseecan, under provisions of Amendment 30, enter Mode 2. One of the provisionsof Mode 2 allows the licensee to no longer man the control room with licensedoperators. The staff has determined in previous license amendments, thatthe potential accidents analyzed for TMI-2 in the current cleanup-modeare bounded in scope and severity by the range of accidents originallyanalyzed in the facility FSAR. The change proposed by the licensee is achange to the Appendix A Technical Specifications. The change proposedby the licensee would resolve a potential disparity between required qualificationsof unit staff personnel required by the Appendix A Technical Specificationsand the plant conditions after entering Mode 2. The proposed change does not significantly increase the probability orconsequences of an accident previously evaluated because no changes areproposed to current safety systems or setpoints. The proposed change doesnot create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany accident previously evaluated because no new modes of operation ornew equipment are being introduced. The proposed change removes the requirementto comply with ANSI-N18.1 1971, after the plant enters Mode 2, and as suchdoes not affect the potential or severity of an accident at TMI-2. Theproposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin ofsafety, because the facility would be defueled and the possibility of acriticality would be precluded. Based on the above considerations, the staff proposes to determine thatthe proposed change does not involve a significant hazards consideration.<T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Government Publications Section,State Library of Pennsylvania, Walnut Street and Commonwealth Avenue, Box1601, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania 17105. <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Ernest L.

Theproposed change would revise the definition of Core Alteration to excludethe normal movement of LPRMs or the undervessel replacement of SRMs, IRMs,LPRMs, TIPs, or special moveable detectors from being considered a corealteration. The proposed change to Section 3.9.5 is only to remain consistentwith the proposed revised definition. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The staff has evaluated this proposed amendment and determined thatit involves no significant hazards consideration. According to 10 CFR 50.92(c),a proposed amendment to an operating license involves no significant hazardsconsideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the amendmentwould not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of anew or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated;or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated because the ClintonPower Station reactor (BWR/6) design is such that the movement of incoreinstrumentation, including withdrawal or insertion for the purpose of replacement,does not constitute an operation that significantly affects core reactivity.In addition, such movement does not physically change the core configuration,or potentially degrade the condition of the reactor vessel with respectto its capability for containing reactor coolant. The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or differentkind of accident from any accident previously evaluated since the additionof LPRM movement or the removal of the moveable incore instruments is notsignificantly different than the movement of incore instruments that iscurrently allowed by the Technical Specifications. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a marginof safety as the change involves no alteration to plant design and affectsno setpoints or margins assumed in any accident analysis. For the reasons stated above, the staff believes this proposed amendmentinvolves no significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Vespasian Warner Public Library,120 West Johnson Street, Clinton, Illinois 61727 <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Sheldon Zabel, Esq., Schiff, Hardin andWaite, 7200 Sears Tower, 233 Wacker Drive, Chicago, Illinois 60606 <T3>NRC Project Director: </T3>John W.

Cook Nuclear Plant, Units Nos. 1 and 2, Berrien County, Michigan </ITAG><T3>Date of amendments request: </T3>February 6, 1989 and supplementedon November 10, 1989 <T3>Description of amendments request: </T3>The licensee proposes to modifyfire protection technical specifications (TS) for Unit 1 and Unit 2 assummarized herein. The first change (change category (A)) would delete the requirement tomake a special report to the NRC if the required fire detection systems,fire suppression systems, or fire rated assemblies are not restored tooperable status within the specified time. In addition, a statement isadded to the Bases which states that compensatory actions should not berelied on for an extended period of time and that action to restore therequired fire protection equipment to operable status will be taken withina reasonable amount of time. Change Category B involves modifying the action statement associated with(1) fire detection instrumentation, (2) spray and/or sprinkler systems,(3) low pressure CO<T2>2</T2> systems, (4) holon systems, (5) fire hose stations and (6) firerated assemblies, to provide alternatives for complying with the actionstatement other than establishing a fire watch (e.g., reliance on sprinklersystems when detection instrumentation is inoperable and vice versa). Editorial changes (referred to collectively as change C) are proposed toclarify the TS requirements and improve their wording. Change D incorporates requirements currently not included in the TS ormakes existing requirements more restrictive. Change E allows 50% of the detectors on a single circuit to be inoperablebefore declaring the detection circuit inoperable rather than the 25% allowedby current TS. The 50% value is consistent with standard TS. Change Category F deletes the detection systems associated with the charcoalfilter units 1-HV-CFT 1 and 2. These detection systems are not taken creditfor in any Appendix R boundary evaluations or exemption requests. The filterunits are not included elsewhere on the TS. Change Category G modifies surveillance requirement 4.7.9.2.b.2 by deletingthe inspection of piping supervised by air. Change Category H revises Table 3.7-6 to convert several low pressure carbondioxide systems from automatic to manual operation. Change Category I allows the use of a liquid level meter to confirm thefull capacity of the halon storage tank. Change Category J modifies an existing surveillance requirement for firesuppression system flow testing. Instead of referencing the NFPA Fire ProtectionHandbook, which verifies the flow rate through the system but does notrequire confirmation of flow through all segments of the system; the surveillancerequirement would require the verification of flow in individual segments.Change Category K would allow the fire pump diesel engine inspection tobe performed during plant operation. Only one of the four fire pumps (sharedbetween the two units) would be rendered inoperable during the inspectionperiod. Change Category L modifies the surveillance requirement to require inspectionof an additional 10% of each type of seal when changes on appearance orabnormal degradation are found in the initial sample only if there is anindication of a plant-wide trend. Change Category M proposes to allow an air flow test as an alternativeto the CO<T2>2</T2> puff test. Change Category N adds a footnote to Table 3.7-6 stating that the controlroom cable vault CO<T2>2</T2> system is only required to be operable when the control roomcable vault halon system is inoperable. Change Category O deletes the requirement that the fire pump diesel testbe performed on recirculation flow. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>In their submittal the licensee addressed why the amendment wouldinvolve no significant hazards consideration. Per 10 CFR 50.92, a proposedamendment will involve no significant hazards consideration if the amendmentdoes not: <ITAG tagnum="21">(1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously analyzed. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accidentfrom an accident previously analyzed or evaluated, or </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. </ITAG>The licensee's basis and the staff's conclusions regarding the no significanthazards consideration determination for each of the proposed changes areparaphrased and summarized below. <T3>Change A</T3> Deletion of the special reporting requirements (Change Category A) willnot affect the actions taken or the time required to restore the inoperableequipment to operable status. In addition, the proposed change will notresult in a change in plant configuration or operation and will not placethe plant in an unanalyzed condition. Thus, the staff concurs with thelicensee's determination that the criteria of 10 CFR 50.92 is satisfied.<T3>Change B</T3> The alternatives provided in the modified action statements proposed inChange Category B will provide adequate fire protection and assurance thata condition will not be created which will prevent safe shutdown duringa fire scenario. In addition, the proposed changes will not result in achange in plant configuration and will maintain adequate fire protectionfor the affected areas. Thus, the staff concurs with the licensee's determinationthat the criteria of 10 CFR 50.92 is satisfied. <T3>Change C</T3> Change C is purely editorial in nature and will not reduce the requirementsor commitments contained in the existing TS. The staff concurs with thelicensee's determination that the criteria of 10 CFR 50.92 is satisfied.<T3>Change D</T3> Change D makes the TS more restrictive. The licensee has determined thatthe proposed changes will not significantly increase the probability orconsequences of an accident previously evaluated, create the possibilityof a new or different kind of accident, or significantly reduce a marginof safety. The staff concurs with the licensee's determination that thecriteria of 10 CFR 50.92 is satisfied. <T3>Change E</T3> Change E does not significantly increase the probability of an accidentpreviously analyzed and is consistent with standard TS. In addition, theproposed changes will not result in a change in plant configuration andwill maintain adequate fire protection for the affected areas. Thus, thestaff concurs with the licensee's determination that the criteria of 10CFR 50.92 is satisfied. <T3>Change F</T3> The detection systems being deleted in Change F are not taken credit forin the Appendix R boundary evaluations or exemption requests and thereare no TS requiring operability of the filter units protected by thesesystems. In addition, the proposed changes will not result in a changein plant configuration and will maintain adequate fire protection for theplant. The staff concurs with the licensee's determination that the criteriaof 10 CFR 50.92 is satisfied. <T3>Change G</T3> The licensee states that inspection of piping supervised by air is unnecessaryand provides no benefit; therefore, Change G, which would eliminate thisinspection requirement, does not result in an increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously analyzed. In addition, the proposedchange will not result in a change in plant configuration or operationand will not place the plant in an unanalyzed condition. The staff concurswith the licensee's determination that the criteria of 10 CFR 50.92 issatisfied. <T3>Change H</T3> The subject systems described in Change H are not required by AppendixR to be automatic and their conversion to manual will have no impact onthe original analyses. The staff concurs with the licensee's determinationthat the criteria of 10 CFR 50.92 is satisfied. <T3>Change I</T3> The method of measuring the fill capacity of the halon storage tank, proposedin change I, has been found acceptable by the National Fire ProtectionAssociation and is essentially equivalent to measuring the full chargerate. The proposed change will not result in a change in plant configurationor operation and will not place the plant in an unanalyzed condition. Thestaff concurs with the licensee's determination that the criteria of 10CFR 50.92 is satisfied. <T3>Change J</T3> Change J will enhance the ability to meet the intent of the existing TSrequirements. The proposed change will not result in a change in plantconfiguration or operation. The staff concurs with the licensee's determinationthat the criteria of 10 CFR 50.92 is satisfied. <T3>Change K</T3> Change K is deemed acceptable by the licensee on the basis that adequatefire protection can be maintained by the remaining operable fire pumpswhile one of the diesel driven pumps is inoperable for testing. The staffconcurs with the licensee's determination that the criteria of 10 CFR 50.92is satisfied. <T3>Change L</T3> The licensee's basis for Change L acceptability is that testing additionalseals when the discovered degradation has apparently been caused by circumstancesrestricted to one particular seal provides no apparent benefit. The licenseeplans to continue testing additional seals when the degradation appearsto have been caused by circumstances which would produce similar problemsin other seals. The staff concurs with the licensee's determination thatthe criteria of 10 CFR 50.92 is satisfied. <T3>Change M</T3> According to the licensee, the airflow test proposed by Change M is a safermethod of testing the carbon dioxide nozzles and is equivalent to the existingTS test from the standpoint of meeting the intent of the TS requirement.Furthermore, the proposed change will not result in a change in plant configurationor operation and will not place the plant in an unanalyzed condition. Thestaff concurs with the licensee's determination that the criteria of 10CFR 50.92 is satisfied. <T3>Change N</T3> The licensee supports that the primary suppression system (halon system)and the detection system provide adequate fire protection for the controlroom vault area. The carbon dioxide system is intended as a backup to thehalon system and need only be required operable when the halon system isinoperable. The staff concurs with the licensee's determination that thecriteria of 10 CFR 50.92 is satisfied. <T3>Change O</T3> The licensee states that the proposed change eliminates an unnecessaryrestriction. The flow path used in conducting the subject test has no impacton the test results and the intent of the surveillance test can, therefore,be met without requiring that a particular flow path be used. The staffconcurs with the licensee's determination that the criteria of 10 CFR 50.92is satisfied. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Maude Preston Palenske MemorialLibrary, 500 Market Street, St. Joseph, Michigan 49085. <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Gerald Charnoff, Esq., Shaw, Pittman, Pottsand Trowbridge, 2300 N Street, NW., Washington, DC 20037. <T3>NRC Project Director: </T3>John O.

There are three specific changes proposed as follows: (a) TS 3.7.A.6 add Low-Low Set (LLS) Technical Specifications (TS) equivalentto the Standard Technical Specifications and delete LLS TS on Table 3.2.B(page 7). (b) Revise the setpoint tolerance on the Low-Low Set Safety/Relief (S/RV)Valve pressure switches from 2710 psig to 2720 psig. (c) Table 3.2.B (pages 1 and 2), revise typographical errors in instrumentI.D. numbers. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>In accordance with the requirements of 10 CFR 50.92, the licenseehas submitted the following no significant hazards determination: <ITAG tagnum="21">1.

The first proposed change would delete the LLS setpoints on Table3.2.b (page 7) and add LLS Technical Specifications equivalent to the StandardTechnical Specifications in Sections 3.7.A.6 and 4.7.A.6. The current LLSTechnical Specifications contain the correct setpoints, but there are noaction statements which are directly applicable to the Low-Low Set functionof the S/RVs. The setpoints will remain the same and the setpoint tolerancewill change as proposed in Change b. below. Also, Action Statements equivalentto the Standard Technical Specifications will be added. The surveillancesare currently conducted, and the testing requirements will remain, in Specification4.2.B and Table 4.2.B. However, the title of Table 4.2.B will be correctedto reflect both ADS and LLS testing requirements. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This change has no effect on the probability or consequences of anyaccident, since the change is primarily editorial in that it relocatesthe LLS specifications from Section 3.2 to Section 3.7.A.6 and 4.7.A.6.In addition, this change adds specific LLS Action Statements, equivalentto those approved by the NRC in the Standard Technical Specifications,where previously no specific requirements existed. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. The second proposed change is to revise the setpoint toleranceon the pressure switches (NBI-PS-51A-D) controlling the Low-Low Set (LLS)relief function of the safety/relief valves in the Cooper Nuclear StationTechnical Specifications. The current setpoint tolerance on NBI-PS-51 A,B, C and D is 2710 psig. The District proposes to change this toleranceto 2720 psig. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The safety function of the Low-Low Set (LLS) Relief Logic is to reducethe number of (and increase the time between) subsequent safety/reliefvalve (S/RV) actuations, following the initial pressure peak during anoperational transient or accident, to reduce the thrust loads on the torusand S/RV discharge piping. The LLS modification was necessary to restorethe safety margin for the structural integrity of the torus and S/RV dischargepiping. By reducing the number of subsequent S/RV actuations, and increasingthe minimum time between actuations, the loads are reduced to within thedesign margin. The LLS relief function of the S/RVs accomplishes its safetyfunction by lowering the opening and closing setpoints of the two non-ADSS/RVs with the lowest setpoints and increasing the range between the openingand closing setpoints of the two valves. This function is armed once anyS/RV opens and the high reactor pressure scram setpoint (1045 psig) isexceeded. The increased blowdown range allows the release of more energyfrom the vessel per each blowdown and allows time for the water leg inthe S/RV discharge piping to clear. This increases the time for reactorpressure to increase back to the LLS setpoint, reducing, or in some caseseliminating subsequent actuations. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The analytical limits on the setpoints for the Cooper Nuclear StationLow-Low Set S/RV function were established in NEDE-22197 (Reference 1).The opening setpoint is required to be less than or equal to 1050 psig,the closing setpoint is required to be greater than or equal to 825 psigand the blowdown range is required to be greater than or equal to 90 psig(modified from 100 psig stated in NEDE-22197 by a letter from General Electricdated April 20, 1983, Reference 2). The 1050 psig upper limit is set toensure that the LLS S/RVs do control subsequent blowdowns. This means thatthe opening setpoint must be below the lowest normal S/RV setpoints (108027 11 psig) by enough margin that the LSS valves will be the ones thatopen on subsequent actuations, even accounting for maximum drift of thesetpoint instruments on both valves. The closing setpoint limit is greaterthan or equal to 825 psig, to ensure that the LLS S/RVs close before theMain Steam Isolation Valve (MSIV) trip occurs on low pressure (referenceCNS Technical Specification 2.1.A.6). The purpose of the lower limit isto ensure that LLS does not inadvertently cause an MSIV isolation. Theanalytical limit on the blowdown range must be set such that there willbe at least 5 seconds between subsequent S/RV actuations, to allow thewater leg in the S/RV discharge piping to clear. In NEDE-22197 (Reference1), the calculated time between subsequent S/RV actuations for Cooper NuclearStation, assuming a 100 psig blowdown range, was approximately 34 seconds,assuming failure of the LLS S/RV with the lowest opening setpoint (worstsingle failure). General Electric also concluded that the actual blowdownrange at CNS of 90 psig would result in approximately 30 seconds minimumtime between S/RV actuations (reference GE letters dated April 20, 1983,and April 4, 1989, References 2 and 3). Thus, the 90 psig blowdown installedat CNS provides significant margin over the minimum of a 5 second waterleg clearing time. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The actual opening setpoints for the CNS LLS S/RVs are 1025 psig and1015 psig. It can be seen that, if the highest set LLS valve drifts +20psig (1025 + 20 = 1045 psig) and the lowest set normal S/RV drifts downby the Technical Specification allowed tolerance of -11 psig (1080 - 11= 1169 psig), the LLS valve will control subsequent S/RV actuations, withsignificant margin, and the LLS S/RV will perform its intended safety function.Also, the actual closing setpoint for both LLS valves is 875 psig. If eithervalve were to drift -20 (875 - 20 = 855 psig), the main steamline isolationvalve low pressure trip instrument could drift up by +20 psig (825 + 20= 845 psig) and the LLS valve closure would still occur before MSIV isolationon low pressure. The opening and closing setpoints 1025 psig and 875 psigand 1015 psig 875 psig are also set such that a minimum of 90 psig blowdownis assured assuming a 20 psig drift of both instruments in the worst casedirections (1025 - 20 = 1005 psig; 1015 - 20 = 995 psig, and 875 + 20 =895 psig). Thus, provided neither valve exceeds the maximum opening setpoint,or drifts below the minimum closing setpoint, and provided the openingand closing setpoints are at least 90 psig apart, LLS will fulfill itssafety function. As has been shown, the setpoints for the CNS LLS S/RVswere established to accommodate a setpoint tolerance of 2720 psig. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This change is also consistent with the Standard Technical Specifications.Therefore, with the limits specified in this proposed change, the LLS functionof the S/RVs will perform its safety function and will not increase theprobability or consequences of any accident. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. The third proposed change revises typographical errors in TechnicalSpecification Table 3.2.B (pages 1 and 2). During the 1988 refueling outage,the two dual element pressure switches, NBI-PS-52A and C were replacedwith four single element switches, NBI-PS-52 A1, A2, C1 and C2. The A1and C1 contacts provide a closing signal to the Reactor Recirculation dischargevalves between 185 and 235 psig and the A2 and C2 contacts provide a pressurepermissive to the Core Spray and Low Pressure Coolant Injection (LPCI)injection valves at less than or equal to 450 psig. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Technical Specification Change No. 50 was submitted to the NRC toreflect the change in Instrument I.D. numbers on Table 3.2.B and was approvedas License Amendment No. 121. However, typographical errors were introducedinto Table 3.2.B in Change No. 50 that are being corrected in this proposedChange. In particular, NBI-PS-52 A1, A2, C1 and C2 will be changed to NBI-PS-52A2 and C2 on page 53 and 54 of the CNS Technical Specifications and NBI-PS-52A and C on page 54 is changed to NBI-PS-52 A1 and C1. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Since this proposed change only corrects typographical errors in InstrumentI.D. Numbers, it does not increase the probability or consequences of anyaccident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. Does the proposed License Amendment create the possibility fora new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Evaluation</T3> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. The first proposed change deletes the LLS setpoints in Table 3.2.Band adds LLS specifications, equivalent to the Standard Technical Specifications(STS), in Sections 3.7.A.6 and 4.7.A.6. This change provides action statementswhich identify specific actions to be taken upon loss of one or both LLSS/RV valves. The current CNS Technical Specifications do not contain anyspecific action statements directly applicable to the LLS S/RV logic. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">There are no changes to the LLS S/RV setpoints or the hardware associatedwith the LLS logic. This change does incorporate the change in setpointtolerance which is described, evaluated and justified in b. below. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Since this change moves the LLS Technical Specification from TS 3.2.Bto 3.7.A.6/4.7.A.6, adds STS Action Statements and incorporates the changesin setpoint tolerance justified in b. below, this change cannot createany new or different kind of accident. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. The second proposed change, from a 2710 psig tolerance to 2720psig tolerance on the LLS S/RV opening and closing setpoints, cannot createany new or different kind of accident. The Low-Low Set Relief Functionof the S/RVs is designed to mitigate thrust loads on the torus and S/RVdischarge piping due to subsequent S/RV actuations. The thrust loads occurwhen there is not enough time between the subsequent S/RV actuations toallow the water leg to clear. The water leg is caused by water being drawnup into the S/RV discharge piping and condensation of steam remaining inthe discharge piping following a blowdown. The design requirement for theLLS function of the S/RVs at Cooper Nuclear Station is that there mustbe at least 5 seconds between subsequent S/RV actuations. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The LLS S/RV setpoints were established to accommodate a toleranceof at least 2720 psig. It has been shown by analysis (Reference 1, 2 and3) that the LLS S/RVs will perform their safety function with the setpointsdrifted to the maximum analytical limits in any of the three possible instrumentdrift scenarios. The three scenarios being the opening setpoint driftshigh, the closing setpoint drifts low or the opening and closing setpointon one valve drift too close together. The maximum analytical opening setpointis 1050 psig, the minimum analytical closing setpoints is 825 psig andthe minimum analytical blowdown range is 90 psig. With a 20 psig driftof each opening and closing setpoint in the most disadvantageous directions,the analytical limits are not exceeded. Therefore, revising the setpointtolerance from 2710 psig to 2720 psig will not exceed the allowed analyticallimits for the system, and therefore, ensures the safety function of LLS.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The LLS S/RV function has been analyzed on both a generic and a CNSplant specific basis (NEDE-22223 and NEDE-22197, respectively). Also, theNRC has accepted the LLS design both generically and for CNS (April 26,1983, Letter D. B. Vassallo to H. C. Pfefferlen and License Amendment No.83 with LLS Safety Evaluation Report, respectively). It has, therefore,been previously shown that the LLS S/RV function will mitigate thrust loadson the torus and S/RV discharge piping, without creating any new kind ofaccident. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Therefore, the only function of the LLS logic is to mitigate the consequencesof previously analyzed accidents and transients. The CNS LLS design hasbeen previously accepted to fulfill the required mitigation function. Ithas been shown that, with the S/RV setpoints drifted by 2720 psig, theanalytical limits are not exceeded and the LLS logic provides the intendedsafety function. Therefore, this change cannot create any new or differentkind of accident. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. Change number three is a purely editorial change which correctstypographical errors in the Instrument I.D. numbers of the reactor lowpressure switches in Table 3.2.B. The plant configuration is as describedin License Amendment No. 121; this change only corrects typographical errorsin the Technical Specification table. Since this change does not involveany hardware changes, no new or different kind of accident can be created.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. Does the proposed License Amendment involve a significant reductionin a margin of safety? </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Evaluation</T3> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. The first proposed change adds LLS specific specifications to theCNS Technical Specifications. This change includes adding specific ActionStatements and maintaining the current opening and closing setpoints. Theproposed revision to the setpoint tolerance described in b. below is alsoincorporated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This proposed change adds specifications which are equivalent to theStandard Technical Specifications. This change has no effect on the marginof safety, since it does not affect the setpoints of the LLS S/RVs, theblowdown range or the surveillance testing performed. The only changesare the format and location within the CNS Technical Specifications (TS)and adding specific Action Statements, which clarify the CNS TS. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This change, therefore, does not reduce the margin of safety. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. The change from a 2710 psig tolerance on each setpoint to 2720psig tolerance does propose to relax a requirement which could affect theability of the LLS logic to perform its safety function. However, the current2710 psig tolerance is very conservative. The setpoints were establishedto accommodate at least a 2720 psig tolerance. With the opening and closingsetpoints drifted to the analytical limits (which exceed a 20 psig drifts),the calculated time between subsequent S/RV actuations (assuming the worstcase single failure of one of the two LLS S/RVs) is approximately 30 seconds.The calculated time required for the water leg to clear is 5 seconds. Thus,with a 2720 psig tolerance, the margin provided for the LLS logic to performits safety function is clearly adequate and is conservative. Note thatthe opening setpoints of 1025 and 1015 psig on the high and low valve,respectively, provide a minimum tolerance of 25 psig on the high valveto the analytical maximum opening setpoints of 1050 psig. Also, the closingsetpoint of 875 psig provides a 50 psig tolerance to the analytical lowerlimit of 825 psig. Also, the opening and closing setpoints are set farenough apart such that both setpoints can drift together by 25 psig eachand the required 90 psig blowdown range is maintained. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The relaxation of the tolerance on the setpoints, therefore, doesnot actually affect the margin of safety of the LLS logic, unless the toleranceis increased beyond the analytical limits. Therefore, the increase in thetolerance to 2720 psig does not reduce the margin of safety. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Standard Technical Specifications provide an opening setpointwith a 20 psig allowable tolerance for both LLS S/RVs. The proposed 2720psig tolerance at CNS meets this same requirement. In addition to the factthat this proposed change has no impact on safety margin, it meets thepractical consideration of setting a reasonable and achievable setpointtolerance. The pressure switches that control the LLS S/RVs must be effectiveover the entire design pressure range of the reactor coolant pressure boundary(0 - 1528 psig). Since a good pressure switch would be expected to havean accuracy of 271% of the upper range limit, it is clear that a toleranceof 2710 psig is not practically achievable. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Based on the above, the relaxation of the setpoint tolerance for theLLS S/RV setpoints is not considered to reduce the margin of safety. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. The proposed change to correct typographical errors in Table 3.2.Bclearly does not reduce any margin of safety. This change only correctsthe Instrument I.D. numbers and does not affect any hardware, operationor testing of any plant equipment. </ITAG>Based on the previous discussion, the licensee concluded that the proposedamendment request does not involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated; nor create the possibilityof a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated;nor involve a significant reduction in the required margin of safety. TheNRC staff has reviewed the licensee's no significant hazards considerationsdetermination and agrees with the licensee's analysis. The staff has, therefore,made a proposed determination that the licensee's request does not involvea significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Auburn Public Library, 11815th Street, Auburn, Nebraska 68305. <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Mr. G.D.

At the present time, the instrumentation associatedwith the Reactor Trip System (RTS) and the Engineered Safety Features ActuationSystem (ESFAS) is response time tested under TS 4.3.1.2 and 4.3.2.2, respectively.One design feature that is common to the RTS and the ESFAS is the two trainsof input relays which are actuated by sensors inside containment and subsequentlyactuate the RTS and ESFAS. The licensee has proposed a change to TS 4.3.1.2and 4.3.2.2 to explicitly include testing of the input relays as part ofthe RTS and ESFAS response time testing programs. The licensee has reviewed the proposed changes in accordance with the standardsfor ``significant hazards considerations'' in 10 CFR 50.92 with regardto their October 17, 1989 application. The licensee concluded, and thestaff agrees, that the changes do not involve a significant hazards considerationin that these changes would not: <ITAG tagnum="21">1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously analyzed. The changes provide assurance thatthe RTS and ESFAS will operate as assumed in the design basis analysis.Incorporation of both input breaker trains to channel response time testingrequirements is consistent with current plant practices. For these reasonsthe change does not increase the probability or consequences of any event.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromthat previously analyzed.

The changesdo not impact any of the protective boundaries, nor are the consequencesof any event increased. There is no negative impact on any of the safetysystems. Therefore, there is no reduction in the margin of safety. </ITAG>Test intervals for the ESFAS are specified in TS Table 4.3-2. At the presenttime, LOOP testing associated with ESFAS instrumentation is addressed twicein TS Table 4.3-2 and is, in fact, the same requirement. Item 6.e is theLOOP actuation surveillance for the Auxiliary Feedwater (AFW) System whileItem 8 is the LOOP actuation surveillance for all ESFAS instrumentationdevices (including AFW). The licensee has proposed that Item 6.e of TSTable 4.3-2 be eliminated by referring to Item 8. In addition, the licenseehas proposed the following clarifying note for the monthly LOOP test requiredby Item 8 of TS Table 4.3-2: <ITAG tagnum="21">On a monthly basis an undervoltage condition will be initiated atthe sensing device to verify the operability of the trip actuating deviceand verify that the associated logic and alarm relays operate. </ITAG>The licensee has also reviewed the standards for ``significant hazardsconsiderations'' contained in 10 CFR 50.92 with regard to their October19, 1989 application. The licensee concluded, and the staff agrees, thatthe proposed changes do not involve significant hazards considerationsin that these changes would not: <ITAG tagnum="21">1. Involve a significant increase in the probability of occurrenceor consequences of an accident previously analyzed. The change clarifiesthe test interval for the instrument channel and relay portion of the LOOPlogic scheme and does not affect the present method of LOOP testing. Previouslyanalyzed accidents are not affected. Without the proposed change, it ispossible that some alternative interpretation of the test could have resultedin a temporary loss of undervoltage protection for the emergency bus. Theproposed change eliminates the possibility of such an occurrence due tosurveillance testing of the LOOP logic. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany previously analyzed.

In addition, certain requirementswould be deleted from AC7.1.1 and added to AC7.1.2 and AC7.4. Generic Letters86-10, dated April 24, 1986, and 88-12, dated August 2, 1988, from theNRC provided guidance to licensees to request removal of the fire protectionTechnical Specifications. The licensee's proposed amendment is in responseto these Generic Letters. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The staff has evaluated this proposed amendment and determined thatit involves no significant hazards considerations. According to 10 CFR50.92(c), a proposed amendment to an operating license involves no significanthazards considerations if operation of the facility in accordance withthe proposed amendment would not: 1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences ofan accident previously evaluated; or 2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from anyaccident previously evaluated; or 3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposedrevision to the License Condition is in accordance with the guidance providedin Generic Letter 86-10 for licensees requesting removal of fire protectionTechnical Specifications. The incorporation of the NRC-approved Fire ProtectionProgram, and the former TS requirements by reference to the proceduresimplementing these requirements, into the Final Safety Analysis Report(FSAR) and the use of the standard License Condition, on fire protection,will ensure that the Fire Protection Program, including the systems, theadministrative and technical controls, the organization, and the otherplant features associated with fire protection will be on a consistentstatus with other plant features described in the FSAR. Also, the provisionsof 10 CFR 50.59 would then apply directly for changes the licensee desiresto make in the Fire Protection Program. In this context, the determinationof the involvement of an unreviewed safety question defined in 50.59(a)(2)would be made based on the ``accident...previously evaluated'' being thepostulated fire in the fire hazards analysis for the fire area affectedby the change. Hence, the proposed License Condition establishes an adequatebasis for defining the scope of changes to the Fire Protection Programwhich can be made without prior Commission approval, i.e., without introductionof an unreviewed safety question. The revised License Condition or theremoval of the existing TS requirements on fire protection does not createthe possibility of a new or different kind of accident from those previouslyevaluated. They also do not involve a significant reduction in the marginof safety since the License Condition does not alter the requirement thatan evaluation be performed for the identification of an unreviewed safetyquestion for each proposed change to the Fire Protection Program. Consequently,the proposed License Condition or the removal of the fire protection requirementsdo not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated. The proposed modification of the Administrative Control Section 7 of theTechnical Specifications includes the addition of Fire Protection Programimplementation to the requirements for procedures and programs, that requireswritten procedures be established, implemented, and maintained coveringthis program. This section of the Technical Specifications is also modifiedto include the review of the Fire Protection Program and implementing proceduresand the submittal of recommended changes to the Plant Operations ReviewCommittee (PORC). In this manner, the Fire Protection Program will be addressedby administrative control requirements that are consistent with other programsaddressed by License Conditions. These changes are administrative in natureand do not impact the operation of the facility in a manner that involvessignificant hazards considerations. The proposed amendment includes the removal of fire protection TechnicalSpecifications in four areas: (1) fire detection systems, (2) fire suppressionsystems, (3) fire barriers, and (4) fire brigade staffing requirements.While it is recognized that a comprehensive Fire Protection Program isessential to plant safety, many details of this program that are currentlyaddressed in Technical Specifications can be modified without affectingnuclear safety. With the removal of these requirements from the TechnicalSpecifications, they have been incorporated into the Fire Protection Programimplementing procedures. Hence, with the additions to the existing administrativecontrol requirements that are applicable to the Fire Protection Programand the revised License Condition, there are suitable administrative controlsto ensure that licensee initiated changes to these requirements, that havebeen removed from the Technical Specifications, will receive careful reviewby competent individuals. Again, these changes are administrative in natureand do not impact the operation of the facility in a manner that involvessignificant hazards considerations. Based on the preceding assessment, the staff believes this proposed amendmentinvolves no significant hazards considerations. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Greeley Public Library, CityComplex Building, Greeley, Colorado <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>J.

Hannon <ITAG tagnum="84">Wisconsin Electric Power Company, Docket Nos. 50-266 and 50-301, PointBeach Nuclear Plant, Unit Nos. 1 and 2, Town of Two Creeks, Manitowoc County,Wisconsin </ITAG><T3>Date of amendments request: </T3>September 7, 1989 <T3>Description of amendments request: </T3>The proposed amendments wouldrevise the Technical Specifications (TSs) to allow reduction of the frequencyof turbine valve testing. An evaluation performed by Westinghouse ElectricCorporation for the Westinghouse Owners Group Turbine Valve Test Frequency(TVTF) evaluation subgroup (WCAP-11525) provides justification for theproposed change. The second proposed revision will update the meteorologicaldata requirements by removing the requirement of recording joint frequencydistributions, specifying recording methods, and making some minor administrativechanges. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards (10 CFR 50.92(c)) for determiningwhether a significant hazards consideration exists. A proposed amendmentto an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazardsconsideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposedamendment would not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create thepossibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previouslyevaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.The licensee has evaluated the proposed changes against the above standardsas required by 10 CFR 50.91(a) and has concluded that the proposed changesinvolve no significant hazards consideration. The Commission has reviewedthe licensee's evaluation and agrees with it for the following reasons:(1) The Commission has established acceptance criteria for the probabilityof turbine missile ejection event. The evaluation in WCAP-11525 for thePoint Beach Nuclear Power Plants shows that the probability of a missileejection event for turbine valve test intervals of up to one year is significantlyless than the established acceptance criteria. The small change in theprobability of generating a turbine missile as a result of longer turbinevalve testing intervals does not represent a significant increase in theprobability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. (2) The proposed amendments do not change the configuration or type ofequipment associated with overspeed protection for the turbine. Decreasingthe frequency of turbine valve testing does not result in a significantchange in failure rate or change failure modes for the turbine valves.Therefore, the proposed amendments do not create the possibility of a newor different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. (3) As noted in (1) above, this change to the Point Beach TSs will notresult in a significant reduction in the margin of safety for turbine missileejection. The probability of turbine missile ejection remains within theestablished acceptance criteria. (4) Regarding the proposed changes to the Point Beach TSs concerning meteorologicaldata recordkeeping requirements, these changes are administrative in natureand do not involve or impact any accidents or safety margins. The Commission has provided guidance concerning the application of thestandards for determining whether a significant hazard exists by providingexamples (51 FR 7751) of amendments that are considered not likely to involvea significant hazards consideration. The proposed administrative changes(Item 4) in these amendments are similar to the example of a purely administrativechange to the TSs. On this basis, the Commission proposes to determinethat the proposed changes to the TSs do not involve a significant hazardsconsideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Joseph P.
