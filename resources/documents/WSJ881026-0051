The move makes good Tenneco's pledge to give shareholders some of the $7.3 billion in pretax proceeds that the company is currently collecting from the piecemeal sale of its oil and gas subsidiary. But it wasn't clear whether the terms of the share repurchase would satisfy Wall Street, which has been clamoring for further restructuring moves by the huge conglomerate.    In a so-called Dutch auction, Tenneco said it would repurchase 18 million shares of its common outstanding at between $50 and $55 a share. A Dutch auction gives the seller the right to name a price, usually within a range established by the buyer. In this case, Tenneco said it would review the prices at which shares were tendered and set a single purchase price at whatever level is necessary to buy all 18 million shares.    Tenneco issued a perfunctory announcement about its plans for a buy-back late yesterday, but details of the offer -- such as the price range -- weren't made available to analysts or shareholders. The press was sent a more-detailed release on the condition that publication be held until today.    &quot;It is a positive development,&quot; said Laura Sloate, a money manager at Sloate, Weisman andamp; Murray, New York, after the company made its bare-bones announcement yesterday.    But Ms. Sloate, who has been one of the company's loudest critics, added that Tenneco should offer to repurchase 20% of its stock, in a range of $53 and $57 a share. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Tenneco's shares closed at $49.875, up 50 cents.    One analyst, also commenting without the benefit of the company's offering terms, said a share repurchase would help Tenneco cultivate sorely needed credibility. Even the $7.3 billion in gross proceeds from the historic oil-and-gas auction -- a sum that exceeded Wall Street estimates -- didn't give Tenneco's stock price much of a boost, said David Fleischer, analyst at Prudential Bache Securities.    &quot;There has been a fear that they would throw that money down down a rat hole somewhere,&quot; he said. But, he said of Tenneco management, &quot;even a leopard can change spots.&quot;    Analysts late yesterday reiterated the widely held belief that W. Michael Blumenthal, chairman of Unisys Corp., is the outside Tenneco director pushing most aggressively for such restructuring moves. Mr. Blumenthal, who joined the company's board in 1985, has declined to comment on his involvement with the company.    In the announcement prepared for release this morning, James L. Ketelsen, Tenneco's chairman and chief executive, said, Tenneco's board &quot;believes that Tenneco's common stock represents an attractive investment for the company and its shareholders at current market prices.&quot;    The tender offer is set to expire at midnight Nov. 28. The dealer managers are Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., First Boston Corp., and Wasserstein, Perella andamp; Co.    Without its crown jewel of oil and gas properties, Tenneco's two biggest sectors will be the natural gas-pipeline that started the 45-year-old company and the Case IH unit that spawned many of Tenneco's current troubles. The profitable pipeline serves 26 states and contributes 23% of the revenues to the new Tenneco, while the farm equipment manufacturing unit contributes 31% of the revenue -- but has heaped on huge losses in recent years.    Other units include its Newport News Shipbuilding andamp; Dry Dock Co., whose main customer is the Navy; an automotive unit based in Lincolnshire, Ill.; a packaging company in Evanston, Ill.; and a specialty chemicals manufacturer and marketer based in London.    The hodge-podge has many analysts calling for further sales of divisions. Ms. Sloate said all units, except for the pipeline and the Case unit, should be sold. &quot;That is how to bring value to the shareholders of this unwieldy, unfocused conglomerate,&quot; Ms. Sloate asserted. </TEXT></DOC>
