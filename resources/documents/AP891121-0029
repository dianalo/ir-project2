Thornburgh said Monday that the plan will take time andsignificant amounts of money to put in place, with states and thefederal government needing to upgrade and computerize criminalrecords so they could be checked by gun dealers.   ``While a comprehensive, accurate system for identifying felonsat the point-of-sale simply cannot be accomplished in the nearterm, we must recognize it as a worthwhile goal to be accomplishedover time,'' Thornburgh said.   Under the attorney general's proposal, licensed firearms dealerswould use a touch-tone telephone to check computer records to findif each prospective gun purchaser had a felony conviction.   Thornburgh said he was ordering the FBI to expand itscomputerized data base of felons prohibited from buying guns. Atpresent, only 40 percent to 60 percent of FBI conviction recordsare computerized.   The bureau was also ordered to draft standards for reportingcriminal records for state and local police agencies.   Thornburgh said the department's Bureau of Justice Assistancewill set aside $9 million for each of the next three years to helpstates comply with new reporting standards.   Under legislation enacted last year, the attorney general wasrequired to report to Congress on what steps could be taken toprevent felons from purchasing guns.   Thornburgh rejected a more expensive option submitted to him bya task force that would have set up a system to instantly check thefingerprints of purchasers in gun stores to determine if they hadcriminal records.   The task force estimated it would cost up to $27 billion toautomate fingerprint records and install scanning equipment in gunstores.   The attorney general said records will have to be improvedbefore a new system can work.   ``No one list of felons exists. In addition, many of thecriminal history records maintained by law enforcement are eitherout of date or incomplete, or both,'' Thornburgh said. ``Finally,current records often contain arrest information without a notationof the final disposition.''   The task force estimated it would cost between $36 million and$46 million to set up a telephone system for checking computerizedrecords. The system would cost $53 million to $70 million tooperate each year.   The task force said a $7 to $9 fee charged to each prospectivegun buyer would cover much of the costs.</TEXT></DOC>
