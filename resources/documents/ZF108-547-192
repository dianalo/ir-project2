 The PC Forum traditionally has been a place notwhere formal things happen but where people meet each other or run into eachother, do deals, form alliances and hear about other people's products.andP;  Manyof us are bemoaning the lack of openness about what you're doing and theadvent of commercialism and so forth and so on.andM;In bringing the Soviet visitors here I'm trying to start that process again.andO;I hope many of you win meet them and maybe neat things will happen.andP;  I'veoften joked I would gladly waive the Forum attendance fee if I could just geta percentage of an the deals done here - I'll make that offer again.andM;It makes me slightly uncomfortable to say, &quot;Okay, here arc the Soviets.&quot; Ihope some of you win come back next year not as  the Soviets,&quot; but asindividuals.andP;  This panel's purpose is to hear two minutes from each of you sothat we can get some sense of you as individuals.andM;At the Soviet roundtable yesterday we had, maybe 30 or 40 Americans, eightSoviets and a couple of emigres and so forth.andP;  In general the question fromthe Americans was how to do business in the Soviet Union.andM;Now imagine there was a conference in the Soviet Union, attended by JimCannavino, Mike Quinlan, Larry Tesler, Jean-Louis Gassee, Marc Canter and KenWasch, and someone asked any one of them, &quot;What is American policy?&quot; There isno single policy; there's no single way to do things; there are lots ofdifferent kinds of organizations.andP;  There are government organizations; thereare co-ops; there are things in-between.andP;  Doing business is as varied in theSoviet Union.andM;With that, we'll just run down the table.andM;Starting with Levon Amdilyan, a minute or two: Why you're here; what you hopeto accomplish.andP;  in your case, you may mention your conference in June.andM;Levon Amdilyan, International Computer Club: Thank you very much.andP;  I'd liketo take one more minute to make some comments.andP;  Every time I come to the US Iexperience a feeling of Disneyland, of wonderland.andM;My first impression came when I traveled from San Francisco to San Jose in aCalifornia train.andP;  From the left side I saw one company; from the other,another company.andP;  Some I never imagined I ever would see.andM;The second experience came when I actually was allowed to visit some of them.andO;I remember very much my experience at Borland and Oracle Corporation and thenat DEC.andM;The third experience came when I met the people who work in these companies.andO;So I have this wonderland, Disneyland feeling when I can see, even touch,even feel Bin  Gates, Steve Jobs and Rod Canion, I can't name them all -every person here.andM;I'm representing the International Computer Club.andP;  it's an internationalpublic organization established in Moscow in 1988.andP;  Our main idea is to helpforeign companies to enter the USSR, and at the same time make it easier forSoviet specialists to communicate with foreign companies.andM;In June in Moscow we will hold our first International Computer Forum.andP;  Wewant to bring into the USSR - not what we had before, mainly  [foreign]traders selling only computers - but the companies making the computers andsoftware, to provide them the opportunity to see what's happening in theUSSR.andM;Dyson: Thank you.andP;  June 14-17, in Moscow.andP;  Registration forms are available.andM;Viktor Prachenko, Academy of sciences, USSR: I'll speak for Mr. Mizin, headof the Institute of Informatic Problems for the Academy of Sciences of theUSSR - IPLAN, for short - and for me, head of the institute's MIS department.andO;Our institute was founded in 1984 by the late Mr. Naumov, a great enthusiastof pcs in the Soviet Union.andM;I am here for the third time; Mr. Mizin is here for the first time.andP;  Theinstitute cooperates with many American organizations and acceptsrepresentatives of different American companies - IBM, Microsoft and someothers.andP;  We also cooperate very closely with Software Products Internationalfrom San Diego; in November at COMDEX 90 we announced a new Soviet-Americanjoint venture.andP;  This is the first pure software joint-venture company whichis oriented to developing, producing and distributing office-automationsoftware in the Soviet Union.andM;Vateri Mirantsev, JV Dialogue: I represent the Soviet-American joint ventureJV Dialogue, which was established in December 1987 in Moscow by six Sovietmembers and one American.andM;Our members are Moscow State University, the Academy Center of Economics andMathematics Institute, the Academy Computer Center and so on.andP;  Our Americanmember is Management Partnerships International in Chicago.andM;We have about 35 affiliates in different parts of our country, in Leningrad,Minsk, Tallinn and so on.andP;  My interest here is to find people who want tosell software and hardware in the Soviet Union, as well as people to sell ourproducts in the US and maybe in other countries.andM;Arkady Borkovsky, ParaGraf: I'm Arkady Borkovsky.andP;  In Moscow I used to workfor the Computer Center of the Academy of Sciences.andP;  Now I'm affiliated withParaGraf, a Soviet-American joint venture which has half of the bestprogrammers in Moscow working with it.andP;  I'm known most for writing the firstRussian word-processor, and I'm one of the first to start getting money formy software.andP;  (In Russia programming used to be a rather academic activity.)andM;My real interest, however, is in the natural language-oriented software.andP;  Thepresentations this morning show that while icons, GUI and virtual reality aregreat for interfaces, we still need something to describe the semantics andbehavior of the things we are building interfaces to.andP;  The natural languageis used by humans to pass knowledge to each other and to future generations;the principles upon which natural language is based are the same principleswe need to use when describing databases, drawings and other things.andM;Alexei Pajitnov, JV Dialogue: I am Alexei Pajitnov.andP;  I am a free-lance gameproducer.andP;  People know me as the inventor of the game Tetris.andP;  I am here on abusiness and publicity trip, with the kind support of JV Dialogue.andP;  I have anew game with me and I'll try to publish it here.andP;  Thank you.andM;Dyson: Thank you.andM;Mikhail Krasnov, Inforcom: I'm Mikhail Krasnov.andP;  I represent the non-statecompany Inforcom, a company started 15 months ago.andP;  The main sphere of itsactivities is consulting and assistance, both to Soviet organizations lookingfor international markets and foreign partners and to foreign companies -especially Americans - that want to develop business with the Soviet Union.andM;Our company already established three joint ventures, and assisted inorganizing seven joint ventures.andP;  I'm here for the final arrangements fororganizing a joint venture with an American computer company for wholesaledistribution of hardware and software in the USSR.andM;Alexandr Barilov, Leningrad Institute: My name is Alexandr Barilov.andP;  I am asenior scientist at the Leningrad Institute for Informatics for the Academyof Sciences.andP;  I've worked for nine years as a software developer.andP;  My firstpc was an Apple II in 1981.andM;One of my special interests is multilingual software.andP;  I translated FrameworkII, a well-known integrated-software package, into Russian, and also I wrotea program which makes Framework bilingual at the same time.andP;  Thank you.andM;Dyson: Thank you all very much.andM;if you have any questions, please come to the Soviet roundtable at 4:30because it's now time for lunch.andM;[Applause]</TEXT></DOC>
