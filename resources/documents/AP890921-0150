In a 3-0 ruling, the midlevel Court of Appeals said it did notapprove of Steiger's conduct but feared it could have ``a chillingeffect'' on politics if the hardball tactics that Steiger used wereconsidered a crime.   Steiger was convicted April 7, 1988, after prosecutors said hehad tried to ``extort'' a vote from state parole board member RonJohnson. He was accused of threatening Johnson with the loss of anoutside job unless Johnson voted Gov. Evan Mecham's way in anadministrative matter.   Just three days before Steiger was convicted, Mecham, afirst-term Republican, was removed from office by the state Senate.Senate members concluded Mecham misused money in a state protocolfund and obstructed justice by trying to thwart an investigation ofallegations that one of his aides had threatened another aide. Theallegations were unrelated to the Steiger case.   Steiger, who served five terms in Congress before resigning in anultimately unsuccessful bid for the Senate in 1976, said AttorneyGeneral Bob Corbin had singled him out unfairly when he brought theextortion charge.   ``Everybody has forgotten that I was very critical of the sizeand the ineffeciencies that the attorney general's office hadcreated,'' he said. ``It's the most expensive attorney general'soffice in the United States and we have the second highest rate ofcrime in the United States. It's crazy.''   ``He was after me not because of Mecham,'' Steiger added. ``Hewas after me because I was a threat to the department.''   Corbin was away from his office and unavailable for commentimmediately. Aides said they had not decided whether to appeal tothe state Supreme Court, but they criticized the appeals court'sdecision.   ``It's bad public policy to say that an independent official canbe threatened with financial harm,'' said Steve Twist, Corbin'schief deputy.   Steiger, 60, was the only Mecham administration offical convictedof any administration-related crime. Thursday's reversal was issuedonly hours before the state Supreme Court was to start hearingarguments on whether Mecham's impeachment and ouster should beoverturned.   Writing for a three-judge panel, Judge John Claborne said thetheft-by-extortion statute was ``unconstitutionally vague'' becauseit doesn't spell out clearly enough what is to be considered illegaland because it permits ``arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.''   ``Certainly we do not condone in any way Steiger's conduct,''Claborne added.   The court said an executive assistant to a governor mustsometimes issue strong orders to carry out the governor's policy,even by suggesting that underlings could lose their jobs if theydidn't comply.   Many of the changes that Steiger was trying to make at the boardhave been made since then under the administration of Gov. RoseMofford, who was elevated from her elected post as secretary ofstate after Mecham's impeachment.   Steiger was fined and placed on probation after his MaricopaCounty Superior Court conviction and ordered by Judge RonaldReinstein to perform public service work for the State Bar ofArizona. He completed the public service work even before the appealwas decided.</TEXT></DOC>
