These small, dual-purpose,difficult to detect weapons present some formidable challenges for verificationin any scheme that attempts to limit rather than eliminate them. Conventionallyarmed SLCMs offer to the navies of both superpowers important offensiveand defensive capabilities. Nuclear armed, long-range, land-attack SLCMs,on the other hand, seem to pose destabilizing threats and otherwise havequestionable value, despite strong US support for extensive deploymentof them. If these weapons are not constrained, their deployment couldcircumvent gains which might be made in agreements directly reducingof strategic nuclear weapons. This paper reviews the technology and planneddeployments of SLCMs, the verification schemes which have been discussedand are being investigated to try to deal with the problem, and examinesthe proposed need for and possible uses of SLCMs. It presents an overviewof the problem technically, militarily, and politically.</TEXT></DOC>
