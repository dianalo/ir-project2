Edwards Deming.andO;SPC is a method of determining whether a process is operating correctly.andM;By far the most interesting aspect of this paper is the elegant andconsistent way in which Navistar has integrated a solution to the technicalproblems of establishing and reliably meeting service-level objectives, withthe need for managing and reporting on actual performance.andP;  Using standardMVS monitoring facilities, the data center has determined the criteria or SPCcontrol limits within which performance can be considered under control.andO;Using another TQM method, called cause-and-effect diagrams, they thendetermine and correct the underlying causes of each observed occurrence ofout-of-control performance.andM;Finally, Navistar has tied the results of both monitoring and thecause-and-effect studies into what are perhaps the first truly meaningfulmanagement reports on operations effectiveness.andP;  Considering the typicalefforts and reports found in most installations, the Navistar work mustcertainly be considered a triumph for TQM methods.andM;A second CMG '90 presentation &quot;Quality Improvement Process for InformationSystems,&quot; by Morris Polston of Miles Inc., Elkhart, Ind., discussed how aquality improvement program can benefit an information system organization.andM;Actually, many other papers and presentations at CMG '90 included examples ofapplying TQM methods to improving processes within IS operations.andP;  However,due to the apparent unfamiliarity of the authors with TQM, they did notexplicitly use the terminology of TQM.andP;  Nonetheless, to one knowledgeable inTQM, these papers further reinforce the belief that TQM can contribute muchvalue to the IS operations and capacity management functions.andM;TQM has matured well beyond its original emphasis on SPC and manufacturing,although this is still at the heart of the discipline.andM;Among the other important contributions TQM has to offer, perhaps the mostsalient is its understanding of the relation of the design process to processcost, responsiveness and reliability.andP;  IS is now at the threshold of a majorshift to using integrated computer-aided software engineering (Case) forapplications design and development.andP;  Certainly, the possible contributionsof TQM to Case, especially to enterprise modeling, should be vigorouslyexplored.andM;The terminology differences and the difference in focus of TQM often make itdifficult for an IS professional to see how TQM relates to his or herresponsibilities.andP;  The sheer quantity of books and articles on differentaspects of &quot;pure&quot; TQM makes it even more difficult to know where to begin.andO;(The sidebar, &quot;TQM Sources,&quot; is an admittedly biased list of sources thereader may wish to explore.)andM;However, the effort can be quite rewarding professionally and to yourcompany, for the IS and TQM disciplines share identical goals and their meansof attaining them are deeply similar and/or compatible.andP;  Developing thesynergy possible between these disciplines promises to be an exciting careerpath.andP;  Post-and-beam MIS may be a possibility.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
