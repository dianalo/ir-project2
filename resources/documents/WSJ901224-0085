Do we trust in God? Do you? Should we pay moreattention to this motto we all carry with us?   It seems to be inscribed in the minds and hearts of manyof our business and political leaders. Total self-reliance isnot how things actually work. For example, Secretary of StateJames Baker acknowledges that in the diplomatic power gamethere is always a higher power. At the annual National PrayerBreakfast in Washington, D.C., in February, he was quoted assaying: &quot;Inner security and true real fulfillment comes byfaith. It doesn't come by wielding power in a town wherepower is king.&quot; He candidly stated that his wife had helpedhim cope with a personal problem by teaching him to pray andhelping him to realize his true position in life. &quot;I reallyneeded to stop trying to play God and turn the matter over toHim.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Walter Hoving, the head of Tiffany's from 1955 to 1980,died last year at age 91. He built sales during his tenurefrom $7 million to $100 million. Convinced that his entirecareer was guided by God, he had Tiffany's produce smallsilver-plate pins (later expanded to include sterling silver,Vermeil and gold) with the message &quot;Try God&quot; spelled out.   Was Mr. Hoving merely an eccentric business success? IsJames Baker just a little unusual? It seems not. The ranks ofAmerican industry and government are studded with the namesof successful leaders who are not afraid to state their firmbelief in God and then, of greater importance, to actaccording to that belief.   Peter Grace, formerly of W. R. Grace Inc., has never beenshy about his association with the Catholic Church and itsworks in the New York archdiocese. Perhaps in hisenvironmentally sensitive business, he needed all the help hecould get.   Tom Phillips, of Raytheon, famous for its air defensesystems and now making great strides in air-traffic control,started a prayer-breakfast group in the mid-1980s that stillmeets today. Forty or so business leaders gather to discussethical or spiritual topics or hear an inspirational talk atthis little-publicized forum. Ken Olsen, of Digital EquipmentCorp., is reported to be a regular attendee. Now that IBM hasits sights locked on DEC's once-invulnerable market niche,Mr. Olsen has a great deal for which to pray.   At the worker level, in many companies there are smallscripture-study gatherings that meet at lunchtime. WangLaboratories has such a group, and who can say whether thathad something to do with its modest comeback in profitabilityafter its recent reorganization?   Of course, most people would prefer to keep theirreligious beliefs separate from their careers. But it'simpossible to compartmentalize one's life completely. OurConstitution separates church and state, and it would be wisenot to designate a company religion. It is, however,difficult for many of us to deny the impact of the workingsof God in the world -- and that includes the business world.Worship on the weekend and business-as-usual the rest of theweek isn't how things work.   Can you deny the existence of God and his workings in theworld and succeed in at least a secular monetary sense? Yes.Free will allows the world to operate in its own mysteriousway. In fact, some might argue that the bottom linenecessitates an occasional departure from strict applicationof God's rules -- an approach to which Edwin Land, thefounder of Polaroid, had a ready response. At oneshareholders' meeting in 1977, he responded to desperatereports of a product reversal by saying, &quot;The bottom line isin heaven.&quot;   Indeed, the role of providence in decisions and outcomesshould not be overlooked. We are all told how importanttiming is in business, yet no one has any idea how to be atthe right place at the right time. Some will say luck is abig factor (always combined with hard work). If so, perhapsthe business schools should teach a two-semester course inluck. (First semester, good luck; second semester, bad luck.)It would go well with a companion set of courses on timing.(First semester, too soon; second semester, too late.)   It is difficult to attribute specifics in businessdirectly to God. It is equally difficult to deny hisinvolvement. (You can, of course, if you choose to])   It is human nature to turn to God in difficult orimpossible times (referred to as &quot;fox-hole religion&quot; inwartime). If, as the saying goes, &quot;God is my co-pilot,&quot; whynot let him take over? Many do. It is a higher form of humannature to turn to God in good times.   Why do so many well-known and successful executives feelthat God is a dominant force in their lives and in theirbusinesses? The ethics of everyday operations and how peopleshould be treated are issues that are not covered very wellin business schools or in most management books. On the otherhand, students of management study the traits of successfulleaders. We might do well to study the practices ofexecutives who rely on God.   Mr. Hoving's little pins carry a powerful message: &quot;TryGod.&quot; Why not? In this holy season, it would be wise toreflect on this message. Prayer as a management techniqueshould not be discounted.   ---   Mr. Falvey is a writer and speaker living in Londonderry,N.H.</TEXT></DOC>
