A Vortec spokesman said the company hadn't yet seen the SEC filing and therefore couldn't comment. Hinderliter officials didn't return calls seeking comment.    Vortec's board in October rejected a merger offer made by Hinderliter, a Tulsa, Okla.-based manufacturer and heat-treating concern. Vortec makes home healthcare equipment.    In the SEC filing, Hinderliter said its Vortec stake consists of 21,000 common shares purchased Oct. 20 to Nov. 23 for $2.75 to $3.375 each.    Vortec shares closed yesterday in over-the-counter trading at $2.25, down 25 cents.    The filing said an accord under which Hinderliter held an option to acquire 15.8% of Vortec's stock was canceled Tuesday. </TEXT></DOC>
