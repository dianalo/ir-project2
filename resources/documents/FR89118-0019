L. 96-330) established the Veterans AdministrationHealth Professional Scholarship Program to assist in providing an adequatesupply of trained physicians and nurses for the VA and for the Nation and,if needed by the VA, other specified health-care professionals. The VeteransBenefits and Services Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100-322) amended the ScholarshipProgram by permitting scholarship awards to students in additional healthdisciplines, by changing length of service obligation incurred by scholarshipparticipants, and by changing priority for selecting participants. Theproposed regulations implement provisions of Pub. L. 100-322.The proposed regulations for the Veterans Administration Health ProfessionalScholarship Program have been designated as nonmajor under the criteriaof Executive Order 12291, Federal Regulation. The regulations will notresult in (1) an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more;(2) a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, State or local government agencies or geographic regions; or (3)significant adverse effects on competition, employment investment, productivity,innovation, or the ability of United States-based enterprises to competewith foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.The Administrator hereby certifies that these proposed regulations, ifpromulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities as they are defined in the Regulatory FlexibilityAct, 5 U.S.C. 601-612. These proposed regulations will be directed to individualswho apply and are selected for VA Health Professional Scholarship Programawards. They will, therefore, have no significant direct impact on smallentities.<ITAG tagnum="21">The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Number for this programis 64.023.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 38 CFR Part 17</ITAG>Health professions, Scholarships and fellowships.<ITAG tagnum="21">Approved: December 19, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Thomas K.
