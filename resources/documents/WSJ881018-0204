Scottish andamp; Newcastle swiftly rejected the cash bid, which values the Edinburgh brewer at #1.6 billion, as &quot;totally unwelcome and unacceptable.&quot; The company, a venerable brewer of British brown ale, said it intends to &quot;strongly&quot; resist the bid. Elders already owns 9.65% of Scottish andamp; Newcastle.    The 400 pence-a-share bid is a bold move by Elders to boost sales of its popular Fosters lager throughout Europe and further its global ambitions. Since arriving in Britain seven years ago, Fosters has become a popular brand in the fiercely competitive lager market. With Scottish andamp; Newcastle, Elders would acquire much-needed capacity to brew more Fosters for distribution throughout Europe as the European Community moves toward a unified market in 1992.    Elders's move comes as other big brewers are scrambling to turn their nationally known flagship beers into global brands. Fellow Australian, Bond Corp., last year bought U.S. brewer, G. Heileman Brewing Co., and recently built up an 11.08% stake in British brewer Allied Lyons PLC. U.S. brewers Anheuser-Busch Cos. and the Miller brewing unit of Philip Morris Inc. sell their beers under license in Britain and elsewhere.    But Elders's bid for Scottish andamp; Newcastle could incur the wrath of government regulators who are conducting an investigation of monopoly pressures in Britain's brewing industry. More than half of Britain's 80,000 pubs have ties to a brewer and are obligated to sell its brands. Analysts expect the government to investigate Elders's bid because it could give the company a 20% share of Britain's beer market. Market leader, Bass PLC, has a 22% share.    Scottish andamp; Newcastle's shares soared 60 pence to 411 pence apiece after the bid was announced yesterday morning. The price surge helped boost the overall London market. But Scottish andamp; Newcastle shares later fell back to trade at 405 pence apiece, up 54 pence. Analysts said fears that the government would block Elders's bid helped depress the stock.    Elders Chairman John Elliott dismissed suggestions that the bid would run afoul of the government's current monopoly probe. That study, which is expected to be completed next February, could result in legislation limiting brewers' ownership of pubs. Mr. Elliott said at a news conference here that Courage, Elders's British brewing unit, and Scottish andamp; Newcastle would have to abide by the government's decision &quot;whether separate or together.&quot;    As for Elders's potential share of Britain's beer market, Mr. Elliott said a takeover would create &quot;more competition because we'll be a more formidable competitor to Bass.&quot;    The Thatcher government's record in studying takeover bids this year has been mixed. Last August, the government decided to investigate a #1.7 billion bid for British food group, Ranks Hovis McDougall PLC, by Australian baker, Goodman Fielder Wattie Ltd. But earlier this year, officials cleared Nestle S.A.'s #1.76 billion bid for British confectioner Rowntree PLC despite a political firestorm about foreign ownership of an old-line British firm located in the depressed North. In an apparent effort to undercut that sort of criticism, Mr. Elliott said yesterday that Elders wouldn't cut jobs or reduce operations at Scottish andamp; Newcastle.    He said Elders is running short of brewing capacity in Britain and wants Scottish andamp; Newcastle's breweries to be &quot;the basis of our expansion in Europe.&quot; The acquisition would &quot;position us even more strongly going into 1992,&quot; Mr. Elliott said.    Analysts agreed the acquisition would strengthen Elders considerably. &quot;They will be a very big force to be reckoned with,&quot; said Ron Littleboy, an analyst at Nomura Research Institute. He added that the bid could significantly increase pressure on Elders's global competitors. Mr. Elliott could &quot;force Bond to make a bid for Allied-Lyons very quickly,&quot; Mr. Littleboy said.    Mr. Elliott said that Elders discussed a possible takeover with Scottish andamp; Newcastle last July. A Scottish andamp; Newcastle spokesman said the company decided a merger &quot;wasn't in the interest of shareholders&quot; and broke off the talks.    Elders is financing its bid with a new #1 billion line of credit from a consortium of banks. The remaining #450 million would come from existing credit lines.    In the year ended June 30, Elders's pretax profit rose 73% to Australian $1.06 billion ($860 million). Sales climbed 45% to A$15.35 billion. Scottish andamp; Newcastle pretax profit for the year ended May 1 rose 25% to #113.1 million. Sales rose 10% to #911.5 million. </TEXT></DOC>
