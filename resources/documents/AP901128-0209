McDonald's, in the midst of a sales slowdown in the UnitedStates, said Tuesday that Needham would handle various promotionsand ads for young adults, teens and pre-teens.   About one-sixth of the Burnett account was re-assigned toNeedham, a New York-based Omnicom Group agency, McDonald's said.Industry experts said that could mean as much as $55 million in newad billings for Needham.   McDonald's national ad account, estimated at $300 million, hasmost recently been handled entirely by Burnett.   The Oak Brook-based McDonald's said it was making the movebecause of ``the growth of our business over the years as well asthe increasing demands and workload.''   ``It's a matter of work load,'' said Chuck Rubner, a spokesmanfor McDonald's. ``The account has really grown over the last 10years.''   Burnett has created McDonald's ``Good Times, Great Taste'' and``Food, Folks andamp; Fun'' campaigns.   Burnett chairman Hall Adams said the loss was an ``occupationalhazard'' but added, ``We don't like losing any assignment.''   Some industry analysts have criticized the Burnett ``Food, Folksandamp; Fun'' campaign as lacking the punch of earlier campaigns, such asthe ``You Deserve a Break Today'' campaign devised by Needhamnearly 20 years ago.   Since losing the national account in 1981, Needham had served asa local agency for McDonald's in several U.S. cities.</TEXT></DOC>
