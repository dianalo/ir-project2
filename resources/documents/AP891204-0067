RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court today left intact a rulingthat limits the power of states and their citizens to blockshipments of hazardous waste from other states.   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by Alabamaofficials who failed to prevent shipments of hazardous waste froman abandoned Texas chemical refinery to Alabama.   Alabama officials said they were denied a fair opportunity tooppose the shipments.   The plans for removing the waste to Alabama were approved by theU.S. Environmental Protection Agency under the so-called Superfundlaw of 1980, aimed at helping clean up toxic waste.   The EPA included an abandoned Geneva Industries Inc.petrochemical plant in Houston among priority sites to be cleanedup. The site is contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)and other toxic chemicals.   EPA officials in 1986, in cooperation with Texas officials,approved removal of the waste to another location.   Texas officials signed a contract with Chemical Waste ManagementInc. (CWM) to have 47,000 tons of the waste shipped to thecompany's treatment facility in Emelle, Ala.   Alabama officials, led by Gov. Guy Hunt, said they unlawfullywere denied a chance to participate in the process that led to theselection of the Emelle facility.   A federal judge temporarily blocked the shipment of the waste.But the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overruled the judge inApril and permitted the waste to be deposited at the Alabama site.   The appeals court noted that the Emelle facility is licensed byAlabama and the federal government to handle such toxic wastes.   The appeals court added that federal laws controlling disposalof toxic substances ``ensure that CWM's toxic waste storage andtreatment facility poses the least possible risk to human healthand safety.''   The appeals court also rejected arguments that the Constitutionand federal laws guarantee Alabama citizens and officials theopportunity to express opposition to such shipments before theytake place.   The Bush administration supported the appeals court ruling.   Justice Department lawyers noted that the Superfund law wasamended in 1986 to bar challenges to clean-up decisions until afterthe clean-up is completed.   The law ``does not preclude'' challenges such as the one made bythe Alabama officials, the government said. It only delays them``until after remedial action has been taken and thus (the law) isclearly constitutional.''   The case is Alabama vs. Enviromental Protection Agency, 89-378.</TEXT></DOC>
