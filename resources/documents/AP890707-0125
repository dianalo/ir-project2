Stephen E. Higgins, director of the Treasury Department's Bureauof Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, said the government had studied 50styles of semiautomatic weapons imported in the country and haddecided to ban all but seven of them permanently.   The bureau has been studying the use of the suspended weapons todetermine if they fit the requirement that they be used for sportingpurposes.   The Gun Control Act of 1968 bans the importation of weapons thatare not used for legitimate sporting purposes.   ``The study was undertaken because of the dramatic increase inthe number of these weapons being imported and police reports oftheir use in violent crime,'' Higgins said.   As a result of the study, 43 of the weapons were classifiedofficially as semiautomatic assault rifles and as such were barredfrom further importation.   Higgins said in April that the weapons under study were``basically paramilitary in appearance, they are large-capacitymagazines.''   Of the seven models exempted from the import ban, six are .22rimfire caliber rifles and the other a gun called the Valmet Hunter,which had been considered an AK-47 type of weapon during thesuspension. The seven models may be imported again, Higgins said.   The ban will affect about 750,000 weapons that importers wantedto bring into the country, he said. The suspension had covered newimport permits as well as those weapons for which permits alreadyhad been granted and which were en route to this country.   Higgins estimated that the Customs Service has seized about20,000 of the weapons and that those will not be allowed into thecountry unless purchased by law enforcement agencies. Asked at anews conference whether the government will pay damages toimporters, he said, ``That's something the court would decide.''   Three importers already have brought suit against the governmentover the suspension. Although a federal court has upheld thegovernment in one of the cases, Higgins said ATF would acceptcomments on the permanent ban from any importers for 30 days. Thefinal regulations would be issued ``very quickly'' after that, hesaid.   The bureau, which has the power to control imports, does notregulate domestic manufacture of weapons, so similar weapons made inthe United States would not be affected by the action. Several billspending in Congress would control or eliminate many of the U.S.-madeassault-style weapons.   ATF has estimated that domestic makes account for three-quartersof the 3 million semiautomatic rifles now owned by Americans. ColtIndustries Inc suspended sales of its AR-15, the most popular of thedomestic assault-style semiautomatic rifles, in March.   President Bush, a hunter and a lifetime member of the NationalRifle Association which opposes limits on weapons, came into officeopposing any bans on the assault-style weapons.   A public outcry over the availability of the weapons wastriggered in January, when a man opened fire with an AK-47 and otherweapons on a schoolyard in Stockton, Calif., killing five children.The man, Patrick Purdy, later killed himself.   Semiautomatic versions of assault weapons such as the AK-47 andthe Uzi carbine have become popular with drug gangs, and their usein illegal activities has skyrocketed in the past year, according tolaw enforcement officials. The Uzi carbine has been imported sincethe late 1970s.   A study by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution found that anassault-style gun is 20 times more likely to be used in crime than aconventional firearm.   Sarah Brady, chairwoman of Handgun Control Inc., today praisedthe ATF's action, saying it ``confirms what was long known: thatthese imported assault weapons do not serve a legitimate sportingpurpose.   ``I commend President Bush for his leadership in working towardreducing assault weapon violence by stopping the import of theseweapons of war,'' said Mrs. Brady, whose husband, former White Housepress secretary Jim Brady, was severely wounded in the 1981assassination attempt on President Reagan. ``... It is no moreacceptable to have citizens being gunned down by killing machineswearing a ``Made in the USA'' label than by those made abroad.''   The NRA declined to comment on the action until it was formallyannounced, but John M. Snyder, spokesman for the Citizens Committeefor the Right to Keep and Bear Arms, denounced it in advance.   ``I think that it shows that the undependability of government,because originally, the ATF had certified that these rifles could beimported because they are suitable for sporting purposes,'' Snydersaid. ``I think it also tends to further undermine whatevercredibility President Bush has left with the firearms-owningcommunity in the United States.''   The NRA has opposed limits on the rights of law-abiding citizensto own the weapons, saying the solution to any problem is to lock upcriminals. NRA members noted that Purdy had been convicted ofnumerous offenses but spent relatively little time in custody andwas able to evade regulations in order to buy the guns he used inhis murderous attack on the school yard.   The NRA has argued that the inner workings of the weapons inquestion are identical to those of weapons that have been around fordecades, and that limits on them could adversely affect those whoown semiautomatic hunting rifles.   The study to determine how the imported weapons were being usedbegan in March when Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, who overseesthe ATF, imposed a suspension on imports of five categories of theweapons, including the semiautomatic version of the AK-47 and Uzicarbines.   Brady took the action at the urging of William J. Bennett, thedirector of national drug control policy, who had been told by Bushto determine what should be done about the weapons.   Bush widened the suspension on imports a month later to includetwo dozen additional styles of guns.   At the same time, he called for a limit on magazine size to 15shots. Legislation introduced by Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio,called for a magazine limit of 20 shots.   The weapons on the original suspension list come primarily fromChina, Israel, West Germany and Belgium. Others are made in Austria,Australia, Italy and Switzerland, among other countries.</TEXT></DOC>
