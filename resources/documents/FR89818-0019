Title II, part Bof Pub. L. 100-297 revises the Adult Education Act (the Act), which continuesto be set forth in 20 U.S.C. 1201 <T3>et seq. </T3>The revised Act continues Federal assistance for adulteducation through fiscal year 1993.The primary effect of the Act is the continuance of the Adult EducationState-administered Basic Grant Program. Under the revised Act States arenow required to develop a systematic approach for meeting the needs ofpopulations eligible for adult education programs. States must also expandthe delivery of adult education services to reach typically underservedgroups and involve a variety of public and private agencies and organizationsthat serve educationally disadvantaged adults in the development and implementationof the State's programs. The Act heightens the focus of programs on ``educationally disadvantagedadults''_defined by the Act generally as adults who demonstrate basic skillsat or below the fifth grade level or have been placed in the lowest orbeginning level of an adult education program. Special emphasis is alsogiven to such adult populations as the incarcerated, individuals of limitedEnglish proficiency, adults with handicaps, adult immigrants, the chronicallyunemployed, homeless adults, the institutionalized, and minorities. TheAct also encourages long-range coordinated planning, and increases requirementsrelated to coordination with other programs and public and community involvement.Beginning with the grant from the fiscal year 1990 appropriation, Statesmust pay an increasing share of the cost of programs.In addition to the basic State grant program, the Act authorizes severalnew categorical programs_some to be administered at the national level,others to be administered by the States.At the national level, the Act authorizes a variety of national discretionaryprograms. These programs are intended to enhance the overall quality ofthe Nation's adult education system, draw upon community support, and focuson the educational needs of adults in special populations. The programsinclude the_(1) National Workplace Literacy Program;(2) National English Literacy Demonstration Programs for Adults of LimitedEnglish Proficiency;(3) Adult Migrant Farmworker and Immigrant Education Program;(4) National Adult Literacy Volunteer Training Program; and (5) State Program Analysis Assistance and Policy Studies Program.The Act also authorizes two new State-administered programs_the State-administeredWorkplace Literacy Program and the State-administered English LiteracyProgram. These programs are intended to improve the literacy skills ofadult workers and of individuals of limited English proficiency, respectively.Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act Title VI, part A, subpart 1 of Public Law 100-297 and title VII, subtitleA, section 701 of Public Law 100-628 amend section 702 of the McKinneyAct, which authorizes the Adult Education for the Homeless Program. Theamendments to section 702_ (1) Provide that State applications include ``an estimate of the numberof homeless adults expected to be served and the number of homeless adultswithin each of the school districts within the State to be served''; (2) Remove the State grant allocation formula; (3) Provide authority for a discretionary program; (4) Permit a State to implement the program either directly or throughcontracts or subgrants; and (5) Expand the definition of ``State'' to include the Virgin Islands, Guam,American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. Analysis of Comments and Changes On April 12, 1989, the Secretary published a notice of proposed rulemaking(NPRM) for State-administered Adult Education Programs and Secretary'sDiscretionary Programs of Adult Education in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (54 FR 14740). In response to the Secretary'sinvitation in the NPRM, 30 parties submitted comments on the proposed regulations.An analysis of the comments and of the changes in the regulations sincepublication of the NPRM is published as an appendix to these final regulations.Substantive issues are discussed under the section of the regulations towhich they pertain. Technical and other minor changes_and certain suggestedchanges the Secretary is not legally authorized to make under the applicablestatutory authority_are not addressed. Executive Order 12291 These regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order12291. They are not classified as major because they do not meet the criteriafor major regulations established in the order. Intergovernmental Review Programs covered by 34 CFR parts 426, 432, 433, 434, 435, 436, 437, 438,and 441 are subject to the requirements of Executive Order 12372 and theregulations in 34 CFR part 79. The objective of the Executive Order isto foster an intergovernmental partnership and a strengthened federalismby relying on processes developed by State and local governments for coordinationand review of proposed Federal financial assistance. In accordance with the order, this document is intended to provide earlynotification of the Department's specific plans and actions for these programs.Assessment of Educational Impact In the notice of proposed rulemaking the Secretary requested comments onwhether the proposed regulations in this document would require transmissionof information that is being gathered by or is available from any otheragency or authority of the United States. Based on the response to the proposed rules and on its own review, theDepartment has determined that the regulations in this document do notrequire transmission of information that is being gathered by or is availablefrom any other agency or authority of the United States. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects </ITAG>34 CFR Part 425 Administrative practice and procedure, Adult education, Grant programs.34 CFR Part 426Administrative practice and procedure, Adult education, Bilingual education,Business and industry, Colleges and universities, Day care, Education,Education of disadvantaged, Education of handicapped, Foreign persons,Grant programs, Labor unions, Libraries, Manpower training programs, Migrantlabor, Minority groups, Prisoners, Public health, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements, Secondary education, Transportation, Vocational education,Volunteers. 34 CFR Parts 432 and 433 Adult education, Business and industry, Colleges and universities, Daycare, Education, Grant programs, Labor unions, Manpower training programs,Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Schools, Transportation. 34 CFR Parts 434 and 435 Adult education, Bilingual education, Education, Grant programs, Reportingand recordkeeping requirements. 34 CFR Part 436 Adult education, bilingual education, Education, Foreign persons, Grantprograms, Migrant labor, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. 34 CFR Part 437 Adult education, Elderly, Education, Grant programs, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements, Volunteers. 34 CFR Parts 438 and 441 Adult education, Education, Grant programs, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements.<ITAG tagnum="20">(Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Numbers: 84.002 Adult EducationState-administered Basic Grant Program; 84.192 Adult Education for theHomeless Program; 84.198 National Workplace Literacy Program; and 84.223State-administered English Literacy Program.

Specific comments arearranged in order of the sections of the final regulations to which theypertain.<ITAG tagnum="81">Part 425_Adult Education_General Provisions</ITAG>Definitions (Section425.4)<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter expressed concern about the definitionsof adult basic education, adult secondary education, and adults with limitedEnglish proficiency (LEP). The commenter interpreted these definitionsas requiring States to group students by ``categorical definitions basedon a grade level kind of achievement or implied ability level.'' The commenteralso thought that the regulations precluded programs from serving LEP studentsif those students had attained sixth grade basic literacy. The commentersuggested that the regulations add at least an ``instructional definition''relating to ``functional literacy as situational achievement.'' The commenterstated that adding ``instructional definitions'' would ``reduce confusionbetween instructional type and program category'' and could ``provide insightinto what curriculum or pedagogy can be considered, what can be taughtand how it can be taught.''<T3>Discussion:</T3> The regulations allow, but do not require, Statesto use grade level measures for distinguishing between adult basic andadult secondary education. Nothing in the regulations requires States touse a specific type of instruction for either adult basic or secondaryeducation, and the Secretary believes it would be appropriate to do this.The commenter apparently misunderstood the regulations' treatment of LEPstudents. States have flexibility to address any particular needs thesestudents may have at both the adult basic and secondary levels.<T3>Changes:</T3> None.Definition of Expansion (Section 425.4)<T3>Comment:</T3> A commenter suggested that expansion should not be definedonly as increasing the number of agencies_other than LEAs_used to provideadult education and support services in order to increase the number ofadults served. The commenter sees this definition in conflict with thelegislative purpose to improve educational opportunities. The commenterstated that in some instances better services could be provided by reducingthe number of deliverers of services but increasing the breadth and scopeof services available to more participants. The commenter, therefore, recommendedthat expansion be redefined to include an increase in agencies, sites,available services, or number of students served.<T3>Discussion:</T3> The definition of expansion implements section 342(c)(3) and (4) of the Act. These provisions specifically require that agenciesother than LEAs be used to expand the delivery of services. The Secretarybelieves that this expansion should include an increased number of agenciesother than LEAs, in order to increase the number of adults served. TheSecretary agrees that programs should be improved in other ways; however,these improvements should not be used in lieu of the type of expansioncontemplated by the regulatory definition.<T3>Changes:</T3> None.Definition of State Administrative Costs (Section 425.4)<T3>Comments:</T3> Several commenters raised questions concerning the definitionof State administrative costs. Concerns centered on the exclusion of ancillaryactivities, such as evaluation, teacher training, dissemination, technicalassistance, and curriculum development, from the definition. Some commentersinterpreted the regulations as prohibiting the use of funds for these activities.One commenter supported the definition since it excludes ancillary servicesfrom the statutory cap on State administrative costs.<T3>Discussion:</T3> The Secretary agrees with the commenters that thesedesignated activities are vital to an effective adult education program.The exclusion of these activities from the definition is generally carriedover from previous regulations. Their continued exclusion helps clarifythat these activities are allowable costs that are not included in thestatutory cap on State administrative costs that becomes effective July1, 1991. The Secretary has decided to exclude the enumerated activitiesfrom the definition, and has decided to modify the definition to describethese activities as ``additional'' rather than ``ancillary.''<T3>Change:</T3> The definition now refers to additional allowable activitiesthat a State may conduct in addition to its administrative responsibilities.<ITAG tagnum="81">Part 426_Adult Education State-Administered Basic Grant Program</ITAG>AdministrativeStaff (Section 426.3(b)(5))<T3>Comments:</T3> Several commenters, while supporting the need for theassignment of qualified personnel to administer the program, pointed outthat the regulations do not define ``qualified'' and do not provide forFederal enforcement of personnel qualifications.<T3>Discussion:</T3> The purpose of this provision is to emphasize thefactors a State must consider in assigning personnel to carry out its responsibilitiesunder the Act. The Secretary sees no need to prescribe the exact type ofeducation and experience that make a State's personnel ``qualified'' tocarry out these responsibilities.<T3>Changes:</T3> None.Tuition and Fees (Section 426.10(b)(7))<T3>Comments:</T3> Several commenters took exception to the requirementthat State applications include an assurance that prohibits charges orrequired purchases for participants in adult basic education programs.These commenters thought the tuition and fees could be used as additionalrevenue for matching, purchasing additional materials, or program expansion.Several other commenters endorsed the prohibition against charging adultbasic education students, since fees could be construed as barriers toparticipation. Other commenters recommended a sliding-scale fee structure,a waiver for the indigent, or a voluntary fee. One commenter agreed withthe prohibition on charges for instructional services, but recommendedthat participants be allowed to purchase textbooks. Another commenter favoreda charge for books and a modest fee for General Education Development (GED)studies.<T3>Discussion:</T3> Historically, the Secretary has supported a prohibitionon charges for adult basic education services, or requiring participantsto purchase books or other materials. This policy furthers the broad statutorypurpose to reach educationally disadvantaged adults. It has been reflectedin past program regulations and is continued in andSection; 426.10(b)(7).Nothing in the legislative history of Public Law 100-297 indicates thatCongress disapproved of this policy. Moreover, the Secretary believes thattuition and fees would actually undermine the statute's requirements regardingefforts to reach underserved adults and to attract and assist their meaningfulparticipation in adult education. Undereducated adults are precisely thosepersons least likely to have adequate financial resources available foreducational expenses.Even if the Secretary were to modify the prohibition, States and localrecipients still could not apply tuition and fees collected from studentstoward meeting matching, cost sharing, or maintenance of effort requirementsof a program. See 34 CFR 76.534.With regard to the purchase of books or materials, there is nothing inthe referenced program assurance to prevent an adult basic education participantfrom purchasing books or other materials should the participant desireto do so. The prohibition does not allow these purchases to be required.The Secretary wishes to point out that this prohibition applies only toadult basic education programs, services, and activities. Therefore, Statesare permitted to assess necessary and reasonable charges for adult secondaryeducation programs, services, and activities, such as services that prepareparticipants for high school equivalency diplomas or GED examinations.<T3>Changes:</T3> None.Public Comment on State Plans (Section 426.11(b))<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter expressed concern that adequate noticemay not be given for public meetings on the State plan. The commenter favoredpublic notification at least three weeks in advance through invitationsand the news media.<T3>Discussion:</T3> Section 342(a)(2) of the statute requires an SEA toconduct public hearings so that all segments of the public will have anopportunity to present their views and recommendations regarding the Stateplan. Section 342(a)(2) also requires that these hearings be preceded byappropriate and sufficient notice. The regulatory language in andSection;326.11(b) is based on the statute. While the Secretary is very supportiveof ensuring that appropriate and sufficient notice is given to the public,the Secretary does not believe it is necessary to be more prescriptivein this requirement, since States should be allowed to structure publicparticipation according to local needs and circumstances.<T3>Change:</T3> None.State Plan (Section 426.12)<T3>Comment:</T3> A commenter saw andSection; 426.12 as creating redundanciesin the required content of a State plan. Particular attention was directedto the descriptions required on expanding the delivery system, outreach,and providing for the needs of limited English proficient adults. The commentersuggested that these areas be consolidated and included in andSection; 426.12(a)(2)(ii)(A).Likewise, the commenter suggested that the use of volunteers not be addressedseparately but be included as a part of the andSection; 426.12(a)(13).<T3>Discussion:</T3> The regulations follow the general format establishedby the Act for the components of the State plan. Neither the statute northe regulations require redundant information. The Secretary does not requirethe States to submit their plans in a particular format. However each planmust satisfy the requirements of the statute and regulations.<T3>Changes:</T3> None.Program Goals (Section 426.12(a)(2))<T3>Comments:</T3> Some commenters requested clarification of the meaningof ``expected outcomes'' as they relate to programs, services, and activitiesthat must be described in a State plan. One commenter asked who decideswhich outcomes are important.<T3>Discussion:</T3> Neither the statute nor the regulations make any attemptto prescribe specific outcomes. The SEA has the responsibility to identify,determine the importance of, and define the expected outcomes to be derivedfrom programs, services, and activities under its State plan. In doingso, it should design and administer a statewide program that best meetsthe adult education needs of all segments of the adult population, especiallyadults who are educationally disadvantaged. Contributing to the State'sdecisions are the public and private sectors through their involvementin the development of the State plan. A State advisory council, if establishedor designated, also makes a contribution.<T3>Changes:</T3> None.Addressing Needs of Special Populations (Section 426.12(a)(9))<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter opposed the requirement that the Stateplan describe how the particular educational needs of designated specialpopulations in the State will be addressed. The commenter suggested thatthe provision was unnecessary and would generate needless paperwork. Thecommenter suggested that a better provision would simply require Statesto include a needs assessment of these special populations with an indicationof whether the assessment suggests a programmatic emphasis on one populationor another. The commenter suggested that a good needs assessment will identifythose particular populations that merit a greater claim on resources.<T3>Discussion:</T3> Section 426.12(a)(9) implements a requirement in section342(c)(7) of the statute. In addition, both the statute and regulationsrequire a thorough needs assessment of the spectrum of adults eligiblefor services as part of the formulation of a State plan. The Secretaryagrees with the commenter that a needs assessment will help a State indirecting its Federal, State, and local resources to those populationsmost in need of educational services.<T3>Changes:</T3> None.Review of State Plan (Section 426.13 (b) and (c))<T3>Comments: </T3>One commenter suggested that States submit the Stateplan only to the State Single Point of Contact rather than to the entitiesin andSection; 426.13(b) and (c).<T3>Discussion:</T3> Section 342(a)(3)(A) of the Act requires that an SEAprovide specific State entities having responsibility for vocational education,the Job Training Partnership programs, and postsecondary education an opportunityto review and comment on the State plan. That section further requiresthat the State plan contain the comments of those entities as well as theState's responses to the comments. Section 342(a)(3)(B) of the Act setsforth similar provisions regarding the State advisory council, if a councilhas been established. The regulations in andSection; 426.13(b) and (c) implementthe statutory language. States must also follow any applicable State proceduresrespecting the State Single Point of Contact. See andSection; 425.3(a)(5),which references the Department's regulations on intergovernmental review.<T3>Changes:</T3> None.Approval of State Plan Amendments (Section 426.23)<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter suggested that the Secretary be alloweda shorter response time for the approval of State plan amendments. Thecommenter suggested a maximum of 30 days be allowed since programs mayhave to change quickly.<T3>Discussion:</T3> Section 426.23 follows section 351(b) of the statute,which allows the Secretary a maximum of 60 days to take action on a Stateplan amendment. While it would be inappropriate to change this statutoryprovision, the Secretary anticipates that most amendments will be actedon in less than 60 days. The Secretary will respond to any proposed amendmentas quickly as possible.<T3>Changes:</T3> None.Multi-Year Grants or Contracts (Section 426.31 (a) and (b))<T3>Comment:</T3> A commenter suggested that annual awards are often redundantfor established, long-term providers. The commenter further suggested thatthe regulations should give SEAs discretion to award multi-year grantsof contracts.<T3>Discussion:</T3> These regulations permit multi-year grants or contractsas well as annual awards. Note that States must nevertheless ensure thatthey generally give preference to local eligible recipients that have ademonstrated capacity to recruit and serve educationally disadvantagedadults. See andSection; 426.31(a). Note also that these regulations strengthena State's responsibilities to review and evaluate projects_however longtheir duration_in order to ensure their effectiveness. See andSection;andSection;426.22 and 426.46.<T3>Changes:</T3> None.Approval of Local Applications (Section 426.31(c)(1))<T3>Comments: </T3>Several commenters suggested that the language of andSection;426.31(c)(1) should define more clearly the scope of one of the descriptionsrequired of a local applicant. One commenter recommended that the languagebe changed to read ``a description of current programs, activities, andservices receiving assistance from Federal, State, and local sources thatsupport the purposes of the State plan in the geographical area proposedto be served by the applicant.'' Another commenter suggested that the provisionbe changed to ``a description of current programs, activities, and servicesreceiving assistance from Federal, State, and local adult education sourcesin the geographic area proposed to be served.''<T3>Discussion: </T3>The Secretary agrees that the language needs clarification.The Secretary believes the provision is best clarified by requiring a localapplicant to provide ``a description of current programs, activities, andservices receiving assistance from Federal, State, and local sources thatprovide adult education in the geographic area proposed to be served bythe applicant.''<T3>Changes: </T3>The language of andSection; 426.31(c)(1) has been clarified.Coordination of Programs (Section 426.31(c)(3))<T3>Comment: </T3>Section 426.31(c)(3) requires that a local applicationcontain assurances that the adult education programs, services, or activitiesthat the applicant proposes to provide are coordinated with and not duplicativeof programs, services, or activities made available to adults under otherFederal, State, and local programs. One commenter suggested that this assurancecover only unnecessary duplication.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The language of section 322(a)(3) of the statute clearlystates that Federally assisted adult education must not be ``duplicative''of other programs. This indicates that no duplication is considered necessary.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.Corrections Education and Education for Other Institutionalized Individuals(Section 426.32(a)(1)(iv))<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested adding ``high school equivalency,external diploma, and GED Testing'' to the term ``secondary school creditprograms'' in andSection; 426.32(a)(1)(iv). The commenter suggested thatthis would more adequately describe the universe of programs in secondaryeducation for adults that may be provided in programs for corrections educationand education for other institutionalized individuals.<T3>Discussion: </T3>Section 326(a)(1) of the Act lists the types of educationalservices that may be a part of academic programs for corrections educationand education for other institutionalized individuals. ``Secondary schoolcredit programs'' is included in this list. The Secretary agrees that thisterm includes high school equivalency, external diploma, or General EducationDevelopment (GED). The Secretary also believes that it is unnecessary tospecify this in regulations.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.Supportive Services for Criminal Offenders (Section 426.32(a)(6))<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter recommended that andSection; 426.32(a)(6)include a list of the authorized support services for criminal offendersor that a definition of supportive services be provided.<T3>Discussion: </T3>Section 326(a)(6) of the statute authorizes supportiveservices for criminal offenders in corrections education programs. Thestatute also provides for special emphasis on coordination of educationalservices with agencies furnishing services to criminal offenders aftertheir release. Because the needs for these services may vary, the Secretarybelieves that there is no need, at this time, to provide a comprehensivedefinition of authorized support services. In general, these services shouldassist criminal offenders in the transition from education in their institutionsto education in the community.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.Special Experimental Demonstration Projects and Teacher Training Projects(Section 426.33(b)(2))<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter recommended eliminating the descriptionsand assurances required in local applications for special experimentaldemonstration projects and teacher training projects under section 353of the statute. The commenter also called for the elimination from theregulations of the application requirement to indicate the project's continuationupon the completion of Federal assistance under the statute. The commentersuggested that the SEA be given sole responsibility for determining criteriafor approval and components of applications for these projects.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The descriptions and assurances delineated in andSection;426.31(c) and referenced in andSection; 426.33(b)(2)(i) implement section322(a)(3) of the statute. These descriptions and assurances apply to alllocal applications to be approved by the SEA, including applications undersection 353 of the Act. The requirements relating to plans for continuationare created by section 353(b) of the Act.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.State Administrative Costs (Section 426.40(a))<T3>Comments: </T3>Several commenters proposed that the five percent capon State administrative costs be raised.<T3>Discussion: </T3>Section 331(c) of the Act places a limitation on Stateadministrative costs. Beginning with grants awarded on July 1, 1991, anSEA may use no more than five percent of its grant or $50,000, whicheveris greater, to pay the costs of its administration of the State's program.For grants awarded prior to that date, an SEA may determine what percentof its grant is necessary and reasonable for State administrative costs.These provisions are implemented in andSection; 426.40(a) of the regulations.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.Local Administrative Costs (Section 426.40(b))<T3>Comments: </T3>Several commenters addressed local administrative costlimits. One commenter endorsed energetic vigilance and scrutiny of requeststo negotiate for greater administrative costs. Another saw the provisionthat permits negotiation for a higher percentage as an area for potentialabuse, asked if there are guidelines on negotiating administrative costs,and suggested that the five percent limit be non-negotiable. Conversely,other commenters expressed the view that the five percent cap, althoughnegotiable, is too low and seems almost punitive. Still another commenterindicated that good programs require strong, full-time administrative leadership,and that an SEA should have the flexibility to permit up to 20 percentfor local administrative costs if justified by a local provider of service.Another commenter suggested that the five percent cap all but excludescommunity and volunteer organizations with low fiscal bases, and thereforeproposed a higher limit of ten percent.<T3>Discussion: </T3>Section 323 of the Act clearly imposes a five percentlimitation on local administrative costs but also provides for an SEA tonegotiate a higher rate. Congress principal purpose was to restrict localadministrative costs in order to ensure that a maximum amount of fundsbe used for direct services. However, Congress also recognized that insome cases five percent would provide an insufficient amount of local administrativecosts. Therefore, the statute provides for the SEA to negotiate with thelocal recipients in order to determine an adequate level of funds to beused for non-instructional purposes.The Secretary does not believe that detailed, prescriptive guidance onwhat constitutes a need for a higher administrative cost rate is warrantedat this time. The Act does not impose such a requirement and the Secretarybelieves that within the framework of the law and congressional intent,States should have the flexibility to develop their own guidelines.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.Maintenance of Effort (Section 426.42)<T3>Comments: </T3>Several commenters addressed the maintenance of effortprovisions. Two commenters questioned the omission of any provision toallow a minimal percentage variation. Other commenters expressed the concernthat only State funds, or only those funds under the direct authority ofthe SEA, should be considered for maintenance of effort purposes. One commenterviewed the maintenance of effort requirement as a factor contributing toinaccuracies in reports of the actual non-Federal level of effort and inhibitingthe expansion of programs to community-based and volunteer organizationsthat do not have the fiscal base of public institutions.<T3>Discussion: </T3>Section 361(b) of the statute states that ``No paymentmay be made to any State from its allotment for any fiscal year unless. . .'' the maintenance of effort requirement is met. Section 426.42 implementsthis statutory provision. As described in andSection; 426.43, the statutedoes make provision for a one-year waiver of the maintenance of effortrequirement. A waiver may be granted only in the case of certain exceptionalor uncontrollable circumstances.With regard to the expenditures to be considered in determining a State'scompliance with the maintenance of effort requirement, the statute requiresbroadly that a State maintain expenditures ``for adult education from non-Federalsources.'' The Secretary believes that this phrase should be interpretedto include certain expenditures in addition to those made from State funds.All of the expenditures that the Secretary considers in determining compliancerelate to adult education programs, services, and activities that receiveassistance from, or are directly conducted by, the SEA or another Stateagency. A more restrictive definition would not accurately measure theState's non-Federal level of effort for adult education.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.Program Reviews and Evaluations (Section 426.46(b))<T3>Comments: </T3>Several comments were received on the proposed provisionin andSection; 426.46(b) that would require an SEA to include standardizedtest data in its review of the effectiveness of adult education programs,services, and activities. One commenter recommended that the provisionconcerning standardized test data either be deleted or made optional. Anothercommenter asked whether States must obtain standardized test data for everystudent. Some commenters interpreted the regulations as precluding whatthey regarded as better or more effective assessment methods, and suggestedthat there are many other criteria to use in determining program effectivenessother than standardized test analyses. Commenters agreed that measuresof accountability are needed, but suggested they be brief and non-threateningto learners. The commenters stated that students should be assessed interms of skill strengths and weaknesses rather than by grade level norms.Commenters also raised questions about benchmarks to determine programeffectiveness, criteria or guidelines to be used in the selection of assessmentinstruments for special populations in adult education, and standards forpersonnel who administer assessments in the field. Other commenters suggestedthat the Department identify a variety of standardized tests or specifywhich assessment instruments are appropriate for the various populationsof adults.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The requirements in andSection; 426.46(b) for reviewingprograms build on section 352 of the statute. Section 352 specificallyrequires use of standardized test data to determine the effectiveness ofprograms.A test is standardized if it is based on a systematic sampling of behavior,has data on reliability and validity, is administered and scored accordingto specific instructions, and is widely used. A standardized test may benorm-referenced or criterion-based. The tests may, but need not, relateto readability levels, grade level equivalencies, or competency-based measurements.The Secretary believes that it is inappropriate for the Department to selector approve the selection of specific standardized tests to be administeredin adult education programs. SEAs must determine which standardized testsare appropriate. The Secretary wishes to underscore that States are requiredto gather and analyze data in addition to standardized test data in orderto determine whether programs are effective. States have flexibility todetermine which criteria measure effectiveness within the framework setforth for reviews and evaluations in andSection; 426.46. Sections 426.12(a)(15)and 426.22 highlight a State's responsibilities to improve programs throughreviews and evaluations. The Secretary does not believe that a State needhave standardized test data for every student. However, the State musthave sufficient standardized test data to determine the extent to whichits programs and grant recipients meet the goals of the State plan andhave improved their capacity to achieve the purposes of the Act. See andSection;426.46(b). Note that the Secretary may require certain data_other thanstandardized test data_for all students in a particular project (see, forexample, andSection; 426.46(c)(3)(iv)), or for all students in the State(see, for example, andSection; 426.10(b)(10) and pertinent provisions inandSection; 426.46).<T3>Changes: </T3>None.Program Reviews and Evaluations (Section 426.46(c))<T3>Comments: </T3>Several commenters suggested eliminating the requirementto consider the ``effect of the program on the subsequent work experienceof participants, completers, and graduates'' as a factor in evaluatingprograms. The commenters suggested that it is not feasible to collect thesedata on a systematic basis without excessive expenditures and that therequirements would place an undue burden on the States.<T3>Discussion: </T3>Section 426.46(c)(3) builds on the requirements insection 352(2) of the statute. The Secretary sees these data relating toemployment and employability of participants as valuable measures of achievementsthrough the program. Economic achievements, along with educational andsocietal achievements, have been sought since the inception of the federallyassisted effort on behalf of undereducated adults.A State may choose to use a portion of its Federal allotment or State matchingfunds to obtain the required evaluation. Expenditures for this activityare not considered State administrative costs.<T3>Changes</T3>: None.Reporting (Section 426.46(d))<T3>Comment</T3>: A commenter, while not opposing data acquisition andreporting requirements, suggested that allowing amendments to reports anda longer time period for compiling complete data would improve the systemand strengthen the accuracy of the data. The commenter also suggested thatreporting requirements contained in these regulations be expanded to includeadditional programs providing education to adults, such as those administeredand funded through the Departments of Health and Human Services, Labor,and Defense. This was proposed as a means to provide a more complete andaccurate understanding of adult education in the Nation.<T3>Discussion</T3>: Historically, States have been required to submitreports within 90 days of the close of each program year. This requirementis carried over into andSection; 426.46(b). Also see 34 CFR 80.40 and 80.41.A State may receive an extension of the due date based on a justified requestto the Department. A State may also amend its reports if determined necessary.The Secretary does not have authority to set reporting requirements forprograms funded and administered through other agencies of the FederalGovernment. <T3>Changes</T3>: None.State Advisory Councils (Sections 426.50, 426.51, and 426.52) <T3>Comments</T3>: Several commenters expressed concerns about the appointmentand operation of State advisory councils. While supporting a council asan important element of the program, one commenter suggested either eliminatingor making less restrictive the regulatory requirements relating to representation,responsibilities, the Governor's authority with respect to the level offunding, and use of State administrative funds to defray expenses of councils.<T3>Discussion</T3>: The regulatory language relating to council representation,responsibilities, and the Governor's authority to determine funding levelsfollows the framework of the statute. In accompanying legislative history,Congress also indicated its intention that Federal funds used to supporta council be considered part of State administrative costs. (See Item 17of the Conference Report, House Report No. 100-567, 100th Cong. 2d Sess.p. 383.) Historically, a similar requirement has been included in previousprogram regulations. The Secretary recognizes that a State may wish to use non-Federal fundsto establish an advisory body that is not subject to the provisions insection 332 of the statute and these regulations. Nothing in the statuteor regulations forbids this. However, the non-Federal funds used to supportthe advisory body must not be used to help meet the State's cost-sharingrequirements under the State plan. Of course if a council is supportedat least in part with Federal funds, it must meet the statutory and regulatoryrequirements.<T3>Changes</T3>: Section 426.53 has been added to clarify that the requirementsof the statute and regulations apply only to councils supported with Federalfunds. This new section permits a State to establish an advisory body thatis not subject to the statutory and regulatory requirements if the advisorybody is wholly supported with non-Federal funds. This new section alsoexplains that the non-Federal funds may not be used for cost-sharing.<ITAG tagnum="81">Part 432_National Workplace Literacy Program </ITAG>Definitions ofWorkplace Literacy and Technology (Section 432.5) <T3>Comment</T3>: One commenter suggested that the regulations define termssuch as ``workplace literacy'' and ``technology.'' The commenter was particularlyinterested in establishing the scope of authorized activities related totechnologies such as computers. <T3>Discussion</T3>: Section 371(a)(3) of the statute broadly defines thetypes of activities that may be funded under this program. Section 432.3reiterates this definition. The Secretary believes it is unnecessary toelaborate on the definition at this time. It would also be unwise to giveabstract guidance on whether computers can be used in particular workplaceliteracy projects. As a general matter, nothing in the statute or regulationsprecludes use of computers as a means of providing instruction if thisis necessary and reasonable under the circumstances of a project. <T3>Changes</T3>: None.Selection Criteria_Program Factors (Section 432.22(a)(1)) <T3>Comment</T3>: One commenter requested that limits be placed or examplesbe given of types of activities authorized under andSection; 432.22(a)(1).<T3>Discussion</T3>: Section 432.22(a)(1) is part of a selection criterionand does not attempt to define the scope of authorized activities underthis program. The types of activities that are authorized under this programare listed in andSection; 432.3. <T3>Changes</T3>: None.Selection Criteria_Quality of Training (Section 432.22(c)) <T3>Comment</T3>: One commenter recommended that andSection; 432.22(c) includethe additional language: ``provide training resulting in demonstrated masteryof competencies needed in the workplace and in adult life.'' The commentersuggested that workplace literacy programs will be most effective if theyteach skills related to current and emerging job requirements and to ``broaderadult needs.''<T3>Discussion</T3>: The commenter's concern regarding the relationshipof the instruction to the requirements of the workplace is addressed inandSection; 432.22(a). That section criterion references, among other things``a strong relationship between skills taught and the literacy requirementsof actual jobs, especially the increased skill requirements of the changingworkplace.'' The commenter's reference to ``broader adult needs'' missesthe focus of this program, which is specifically on workplace literacy.It would be inappropriate to encourage or fund projects including servicesnot directly related to workplace literacy. <T3>Changes</T3>: None.Selection Criteria_Quality of Training (Section 432.22(c)(2)) <T3>Comment</T3>: One commenter was concerned about the selection criterionin andSection; 432.22(c)(2). The commenter suggested that individualizededucational plans (IEP) are not usually required for English-as-a-secondlanguage (ESL) students. Further, the commenter proposed that a distinctionbe made between requirements for ESL, basic skills remediation, and GEDtraining. <T3>Discussion</T3>: Section 432.22(c)(2) is the selection criterion theSecretary uses to evaluate the quality of training to be provided in proposedprojects. Nothing in this criterion requires an applicant to use IEPs.However, the Secretary believes that IEPs provide benefits in all typesof workplace literacy programs, including those that provide work-relatedESL training. Consequently, the quality of an applicant's proposed trainingis regarded more favorably to the extent it uses IEPs. This increases thelikelihood that the application will be selected for funding.  <T3>Changes</T3>: None.Selection Criteria_Evaluation Plan (Section 432.22(f)) <T3>Comment</T3>: One commenter questioned whether the evaluation plansdescribed in andSection; 432.22(f) should include the effect of the programon the participants' job advancement and job performance in the unionizedindustries. The commenter felt job advancement may be based solely on factorslike seniority, and that improvements in performance may have little relationshipto the program provided. The commenter also felt that such informationwas especially difficult to obtain in unionized industries, and that theregulations inappropriately called for the establishment of a control group.<T3>Discussion</T3>: The Secretary believes that an evaluation plan shouldbe reviewed on a number of factors. These include the extent to which theplan will evaluate the effects of the program on the job advancement andthe job performance of the participants. These effects are relevant forany industry, regardless of whether it is unionized. Section 432.22(f)neither requires nor precludes the establishment of a control group. <T3>Changes</T3>: None.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter interpreted andSection; 432.22(f) as requiringquantifiable data on program effectiveness for the evaluation plan. Thecommenter suggested that the recordkeeping needed to provide the informationwould require excessive paperwork. <T3>Discussion: </T3>The Secretary believes that a project should producequantifiable data to the extent possible. The Secretary also believes thatit is reasonable to regard an evaluation plan more favorably to the extentthat it will produce data that are quantifiable. However, nothing in andSection;432.22(f) requires excessive paperwork. <T3>Changes: </T3>None.Rural Areas (Section 432.23)<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested that rural areas should be specificiallymentioned in andSection; 432.23, which authorizes the Secretary to considerwhether funding a particular applicant would improve the geographical distributionof projects funded under this program. <T3>Discussion: </T3>The language regarding ``geographical distribution''may include consideration of rural areas, as well as other factors.<T3>Changes: </T3>None. Adults With Limited English Proficiency (Section 432.31)<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter asked whether andSection; 432.31 permitsinstruction of participants exclusively in their native language so thatthey can progress in literacy in that language before being introducedto English. <T3>Discussion: </T3>The purpose of the National Workplace Literacy Programis to teach literacy skills specificially needed in the workplace. Projectsserving adults with limited English proficiency or no English proficiencymay teach these skills, to the extent necessary, in the adults' nativelanguage, or exclusively in English. Note that this program does not permitthe teaching of general literacy skills that are not directly related tothe workplace either in the native language or in English. <T3>Changes: </T3>Section 432.21 has been clarified. Parallel classificationshave also been made in andSection; 432.52, which deals with the State-administeredWorkplace Literacy Program. Union Participation (Part 432)<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested that workers, through their unions,actively participate in all stages of program planning and operation. Thecommenter recommended that detailed guidance requiring union participationin funded activities be included in the final rule. The commenter requestedthat grant applicants be required to consult with appropriate labor organizationsand include the written concurrence of these organizations in their applicationsfor funding. The commenter also recommended that the extent of worker andunion participation in program planning, implementation and evaluationbe included in the selection criteria for funding. <T3>Discussion: </T3>Section 371(a)(1) of the Act permits, but does notrequire, a labor organization to be a partner in an application under thisprogram. This provision is reflected in andSection; 432.2 (a) and (b). Asindicated in andSection; 432.2(c), a labor organization, like any partner,must participate in a joint application for funding and sign a partnershipagreement. The Secretary does not believe that partnerships that do notinclude a labor organization should be required to consult with a labororganization and obtain its written concurrence before filing an application.Nevertheless, the Secretary encourages all partnerships to involve workersand, as appropriate, labor organizations in identifying how a project canbest meet needs for workplace literacy. Note that andSection; 432.22(c)(2)encourages use of individualized educational plans developed jointly byinstructors and adult learners. No changes in selection criteria are needed.This is because these criteria are used to evaluate both those applicationsthat include labor organizations as partners and those that do not. <T3>Changes: </T3>None. <ITAG tagnum="81">Part 433_State-Administered Workplace Literacy Program</ITAG>Reallotmentof Funds for State-Administered Workplace Literacy (Section 433.21)<T3>Comment: </T3>Three commenters requested that funds from the State-administeredWorkplace Literacy Program that remain unobligated at the end of each fiscalyear be carried over rather than be reallocated to other States. Two ofthese commenters suggested that a ``grace period'' of six to twelve monthsbe instituted for funds from the first year of program implementation.<T3>Discussion: </T3>Section 371(b)(7)(C) of the Act requires the Secretary,at the end of each fiscal year, to reallocate that portion of any State'sallotment that exceeds ten percent of that allotment and remains unobligated.Section 433.21 derives from this provision. The statute does not allowfor a ``grace period'' to phase in its requirements. <T3>Changes: </T3>None. State Administrative Costs (Section 433.31)<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter requested that andSection; 433.31(b) be revisedto permit States to use funds to pay the costs of providing State administrationof the grant and of awarding subgrants or contracts to eligible partnerships.<T3>Discussion: </T3>Section 433.31 follows the framework of section 371(b)of the Act. Nothing in the Act authorizes the use of Federal funds fora State's basic responsibilities in administering the workplace literacyprogram. However, the regulations do allow State educational agencies toclaim_for projects in which they participate fully as partners_one hundredpercent of their administrative costs in establishing projects and 70 percentof the costs of these projects during their operational period. <T3>Changes: </T3>None. Funding Procedure (Part 433)<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter requested that funds for the State-administeredWorkplace Literacy Program be distributed under the funding formula forthe State-administered Basic Grant program, rather than on the basis ofcompetitive applications. <T3>Discussion: </T3>As explained in andSection; 433.20, the Secretary determinesthe amount of each State's allotment according to a formula in section371(b)(7)(B) of the Act. After a State receives its allotment, it thenawards funds to eligible partnerships. See subpart D of part 433. <T3>Changes: </T3>None. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter requested that the requirement to distributeappropriations of $50 million or more on a formula basis to State educationalagencies be removed and these appropriations continue to be awarded directlyto partnerships on a competitive basis. The commenter indicated that Statesand Territories have various organizations that function as the State educationalagency and suggested that this form of administration was cumbersome andunnecessary. <T3>Discussion: </T3>Section 371(b) of the Act establishes the State-administeredWorkplace Literacy Program for appropriations of $50 million or more. Theseappropriations are to be distributed on a formula basis to State educationalagencies having State plans for adult education approved by the Secretary.States then make subawards to partnerships comparable to those funded directlyby the National Workplace Literacy Program. Both programs fund the typesof activities set forth in section 371(a)(3) of the Act. <T3>Changes: </T3>None.<ITAG tagnum="81">Part 434_State-Administered English Literacy Program</ITAG>State AdministrativeCosts (Section 434.31(a))<T3>Comments: </T3>One commenter urged that the five percent limitationon State administrative costs, technical assistance, and training be eliminatedor increased to at least 20 percent. The commenter indicated that the increaseis needed to meet the demand for training instructors in existing and newEnglish-as-a-Second-Language programs. Other commenters recommended thatthe five percent limitation be deleted or amended to exclude technicalassistance and training. <T3>Discussion: </T3>Section 372(f)(5) of the statute limits State administration,technical assistance, and training costs to five percent. The regulationsreflect this statutory requirement.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.Set-Side for Community-Based Organizations (Sections 434.10 and 434.31(b))<T3>Comments: </T3>Several commenters were concerned that some States wouldnot be able to comply with the requirement in andSection; 434.31(b) thatStates allocate at least 50 percent of the remainder of their grants toprograms operated by community-based organizations (CBOs) with demonstratedcapability to administer English proficiency programs. The commenters suggestedthat some States have few or no CBOs with demonstrated capability to administerEnglish proficiency programs, and that some States are prohibited by Statelaw from awarding Federal funds to public or private agencies, organizations,or institutions other than local educational agencies (LEAs). Two commenterswanted the regulations to permit States to use the set-aside for CBOs tomake awards to other local eligible recipients, if the State could notcomply with andSection; 434.31(b). One commenter asked whether a State wouldlose its eligibility for a grant under the State-administered English LiteracyProgram, if the State could not award funds to CBOs.<T3>Discussion: </T3>Section 434.31(b) reflects a requirement in section372(b) of the Act. Congress believed that CBOs are the proper parties tooperate programs funded with at least half of the funds available underthe State-administered English Literacy program in each State. The Secretaryrecognizes that some States may be prohibited by State law from awardingFederal funds to entities other than local educational agencies (LEAs).In these cases, the State must describe the legal basis for the prohibition.The State must also propose an alternative plan under which funds awardedto LEAs can be used in programs also operated by CBOs. The Secretary willreview each situation on a case-by-case basis. Each State bears the burdenof showing how CBOs can fully participate in establishing and operatingprograms in cases where CBOs cannot legally be direct recipients of funds.With respect to other States, the Secretary observes that the Act definesthe term ``CBO'' quite broadly. States should be able to identify a sufficientnumber of CBOs that can demonstrate their capacity to administer Englishproficiency programs. Since this is the case, it is unnecessary to speculateon whether a State would lose its grant if it contained no CBOs.<T3>Changes: </T3>Section 434.10 has been modified to require a State toconfirm the legal basis for any prohibition on making awards to entitiesother than LEAs and to propose an acceptable alternative plan that enablesCBOs to participate fully in establishing and operating programs with the50 percent set-aside for CBOs.<ITAG tagnum="81">Part 437_National Adult Literacy Volunteer Training Program</ITAG>SelectionCriteria_Project Objectives and Evaluations (Section 437.21 (b)(2) and(d)(3))<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter objected to selection criteria that consider,among other things, the extent to which a project's objectives are ``measurable''and its outcomes for participants ``will be measured.'' The commenter suggestedthat this language may encourage an undue restriction of project objectives.The commenter recommended that the regulations speak of ``observation''or ``authentication.''<T3>Discussion: </T3>The selection criteria in question are intended toencourage projects that have quantifiable results. The references to measurementappropriately convey this meaning.<T3>Changes:</T3> None.<ITAG tagnum="81">Part 441_Adult Education for the Homeless Program</ITAG><T3>Funding Procedure (Section 441.3)</T3><T3>Changes: </T3>One commenter requested that funds for the Adult Educationfor the Homeless Program be distributed according to the formula for theState-administered Basic Grant Program rather than on competitive applications.<T3>Discussion: </T3>Section 702 of the McKinney Homeless Assistance Acthas been amended to authorize that funds for the Adult Education for theHomeless Program be distributed on a competitive basis rather than on aformula basis.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.Definition of Basic Skills Remediation (Section 441.5)<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested that the definition of ``basicskills remediation'' in andSection; 441.5 appears to be inconsistent withthe selection criterion in andSection; 441.21(a)(1).<T3>Discussion: </T3>The Secretary does not consider the two provisionsto be inconsistent. Programs must be designed to meet the literacy andbasic skills needs of any group of homeless adults to be served, includingsubstance abusers and the chronically mentally ill.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.Counts of Homeless Adults (Section 441.21(b)(1))<T3>Comments: </T3>Several commenters interpreted the application requirementfor counts of homeless adults by school district to mean general countsof homeless adults in every school district in the applicant State. Onecommenter pointed out that these counts are not available in most areas.Another commenter suggested that the requirement is burdensome becauseof the large number of school districts to be included in the count andthe mobility of the homeless. Still another commenter suggested that thecounts would be more readily available by State, county, or other politicalsubdivision.<T3>Discussion: </T3>Section 702 of the McKinney Act requires that eachapplication include estimates of the number of homeless adults expectedto be served and the number of homeless adults expected to be served withineach of the participating school districts of the State. A general countof homeless adults by school district is not required.<T3>Changes: </T3>To clarify the intent of this provision, the word ``participating''has been added to andSection; 441.21(b)(1)(i).<T3>Allowable Costs</T3><T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter requested that costs be allowed in thegrants for training staff of public and private agencies in techniquesand strategies for teaching homeless adults.<T3>Discussion: </T3>Under the cost principles in the Education DepartmentGeneral Administrative Regulations (EDGAR), costs for this type of stafftraining may be charged to the grant if these costs are necessary and reasonableand the training is related to the purposes of the grant. These provisionsneed not be repeated in the program regulations.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.<ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-19316 Filed 8-17-89; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4000-01-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
