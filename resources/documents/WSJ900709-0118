Michael Dukakis, as expected,signed into law an interstate banking bill that allows banksoutside New England to buy or open banks in the state.   The law will take effect in 60 days. A bank, however, canchoose to opt out of the interstate banking provisions untilJuly 1, 1992, if two-thirds of its directors vote to do so.</LP><TEXT>   Until now, only other New England-based banks have beenable to enter the Massachusetts market.   Gov. Dukakis said, &quot;By opening up Massachusetts toout-of-state banks, we will help stabilize our bankingindustry, as well as increase the amount of capital availablewhich can potentially help the credit crunch in this state.&quot;   Analysts, however, don't expect out-of-state banks todescend on Massachusetts any time soon. Many of the state'sbanks are suffering from slumps in the local real-estatemarket and economy, and therefore aren't consideredattractive takeover candidates.</TEXT></DOC>
