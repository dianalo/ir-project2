Westcoast, a gas transmission and oil and gas production concern, said the transaction is subject to several conditions, including approval by its board.    AGIP Canada, a unit of AGIP S.p.A. of Italy, had proven and probable reserves of 4.2 million barrels of crude oil and natural gas liquids as of Dec. 31, as well as 22.7 billion cubic feet of natural gas reserves and 176,000 net exploratory acres. The company's oil production is currently 1,100 barrels daily.    Westcoast said its two oil and gas operations -- wholly owned Westcoast Petroleum Ltd. and 53%-owned Canadian Roxy Petroleum Ltd. -- are active in a number of areas where AGIP Canada has interests. Westcoast added that it will obtain certain tax advantages from the acquisition.    As previously reported, Westcoast last month paid about 83 million dollars for its stake in Canadian Roxy. John Anderson, Westcoast president, said he now expects &quot;a pause in our petroleum acquisition activities and renewed emphasis on our exploration and development activities.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
