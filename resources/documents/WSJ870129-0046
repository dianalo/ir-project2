The Rochester, N.Y., concern entered the $300 million-a-year U.S. 8-mm video market in 1984 largely as a show of its technological strength and to establish itself in the electronics marketplace. However, continuing strength of the VHS video format and the introduction of VHS-C, a popular compact system backed by such major companies as General Electric Co.'s RCA Corp. unit and Zenith Electronics Corp., have slowed the momentum of 8-mm.    Kodak denied that it planned to discontinue the line, but some industry analysts indicated the move was likely.    Separately, the photographic concern said it expects to take larger-than-expected charges for the fourth quarter and for all of 1986 to reflect a previously announced 10% reduction in its work force. Kodak said 1986 net income would be reduced by $1 a share, about 20 cents more than previously indicated. In addition, the company is expected to have 75 cents to 80 cents a share in charges for the year related to a reversal of investment tax credits, withdrawal from South Africa and debt refinancing.    A Kodak spokesman contended yesterday that the company hasn't any plans to discontinue its 8-mm video camera, which is manufactured by a Japanese company. Stock analysts and industry observers, however, expect the eventual exit and Kodak officials previously have hinted at such a move. When asked recently about the future of 8-mm, J. Phillip Samper, Kodak's vice chairman and executive officer in charge of photographic products, said that 8-mm &quot;is coming slowly&quot; and that VHS manufacturers were reluctant to pursue the 8-mm format.    &quot;We're interested in 8-mm but we're also interested in making money,&quot; Mr. Samper said in an interview. Kodak declined to disclose its 8-mm sales, but analysts believe they are about $30 million annually.    Kodak recently has played down consumer electronics, preferring instead to focus on non-consumer applications of electronics, analysts and others note. The company's Consumer Electronics Division, formed in 1985, was renamed last fall and consumer electronic products -- mainly the 8-mm and tapes -- were folded into the general consumer products division. The former head of the consumer electronics division was reassigned as assistant general manager of Latin American operations.    &quot;I think it was an experiment of theirs,&quot; said Eugene Glazer of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. &quot;I think they figured out what it was about and didn't like it.&quot; David Lachenbruch, editorial director of Television Digest, a trade newsletter, said that Kodak hasn't introduced a new 8-mm model since September 1985 &quot;in an industry where you obsolete your own products every month.&quot; He also noted that Kodak hasn't advertised 8-mm much in a year.    A Kodak withdrawal from the business isn't expected to trigger other departures. &quot;A number of companies have dropped out of 8-mm but others have entered the market in the past year,&quot; said Mr. Lachenbruch.    Charles Ryan, of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, said he expects Kodak may switch to new VHS systems using microchips to improve pictures rather than abandon consumer electronics altogether.    In explaining its larger-than-expected 1986 charges, Kodak said that more employees left in the last quarter than anticipated and more of them were higher-salaried. Ranks of the top 100 senior management people and corporate officers were reduced by 26% and of middle managers by about 15%, Kodak said.    Analysts estimate the company earned in 1986 about $372 million, or $1.65 a share, after charges of about $406 million, or $1.80 a share. In 1985, Kodak earned $332 million, or $1.46 a share, including a $563 million pre-tax charge mostly related to its write-off of the instant-camera business. Sales were $10.6 billion.    For the 1986 fourth quarter, analysts estimate earnings of $80 million, or 35 cents to 40 cents a share, after charges of about $129 million, or 55 cents to 60 cents in the quarter. In the 1985 fourth quarter, Kodak posted a $194 million net loss, including a pre-tax charge of $494 million related to its exit from the instant-photography business.    Kodak shares closed yesterday at $77, up 75 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. </TEXT></DOC>
