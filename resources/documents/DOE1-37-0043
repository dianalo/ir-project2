It conducted feasibility study in1984, fundamental experiments in 1985, and combustion verification testsin 1986 and 1987. The combustion verification tests were as follows:piping transport tests for determining pressure loss characteristics,restartability of the pump, and performance of long-time continuous transportthrough piping, long-term storage tests, combustion tests, environmentalconservation tests, and equipment durability tests. The results of thetests are as follows: (1) manufacturability and combustibility are contradictingin many types of coal; (2) CWM can be handled as liquid like heavy oil;(3) CWM is better than pulverized coal and is comparable to heavy oilin view of boiler operation; (4) CWM is better than puverized coal inenvironmental conservation; (5) CWM does not raise problems on equipmentdurability when used for 2,600 hours continuously.
