RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Senate Judiciary Committee, openinghearings on measures to ban desecration of the flag, was urgedTuesday to shun partisan politics and ``punish'' flag burners byignoring them.   ``Every politician in the Congress should recognize that to beignored is the ultimate punishment society can inflict,'' saidformer Sen. Charles McC. Mathias, a Maryland Republican.   Robert H. Bork, returning to the committee that led the way inblocking his confirmation to the Supreme Court, testified in favorof amending the Constitution to prohibit flag desecration.   Bork's schedule did not allow time for committee members toquestion him. But he told reporters outside the hearing room, ``Ihave no particular emotional response'' to returning to thecommittee that questioned him for five days in 1987 before votingagainst his nomination by then-President Ronald Reagan.   The full Senate agreed, voting against him, 58-42.   Bork agreed there was an irony in his appearance since the manconfirmed for the seat Bork had been up for _ Anthony M. Kennedy _voted with the majority in the Supreme Court's 5-4 ruling that flagburning is protected free speech. Bork has said if he were on thecourt he would have voted to uphold a Texas law against flagdesecration.   Asked whether he believed the judiciary committee is capable ofhandling the issue properly, Bork said, ``You may record that Igrinned broadly.''   Mathias, recalling a Longfellow poem, said the ``ship of statesailing majestically through history'' should treat flag burnerswith the same indifference as ``slugs and snails and slimycreatures whose submarine activities do not cause the great ship todeviate a degree from its course.''   The committee is considering proposals to amend the Constitutionor enact legislation to reverse a Supreme Court ruling June 21 thatsaid burning or desecrating the flag as a form of political protestis a constitutional right.   Similar proposals are being weighed in the House. ADemocratic-sponsored bill could be voted on next month in the Houseafter Congress returns from a recess due to begin Friday.   Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph R. Biden, D-Del.,said he plans to hold four hearings on anti-flag burning proposals.   Biden is sponsoring legislation to make to it a crime todesecrate the American flag, an alternative to a proposedconstitutional amendment backed by the Bush administration and manyRepublicans.   Opponents of both proposals said Tuesday that Congress andPresident Bush are overreacting.   ``We are caught up in a crass competition about who loves theflag more,'' said Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio. ``We want to usethe flag against our opponent in the next election and we want tobe sure it is not used against us.''   But Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., sponsor of a proposedconstitutional amendment, said, ``An overwhelming majority ofAmericans are looking to the Congress to ... restore the propercivil respect for our American flag.''   He noted that after the high court ruling, the Senate voted 97-3to express disapproval with the justices' decision. That actioncarried no legal weight.   Metzenbaum and Sens. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and GordonHumphrey, R-N.H., were the three who opposed the resolutioncondemning the court ruling.   All three are Judiciary Committee members who urged theircolleagues Tuesday to withdraw plans to reverse the court'sdecision.   Humphrey produced a pair of bedroom slippers with an Americanflag design. ``That seems to me to be desecration,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
