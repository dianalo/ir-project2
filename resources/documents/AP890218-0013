Mohammad Nabi Mohammadi was nominated as president and Ahmad Shahas prime minister, according to a statement in English by councilspokesman Rab Rasool Sayyaf. In earlier impromptu remarks toreporters, he had said the two men had been approved for thepositions. However, his written statement said their formal approvalby the council was in fact expected Sunday.   Mohammadi, who leads the moderate guerrilla faction known asHarakat-i-Inqilab-i-Islami, was earlier named president of thecouncil itself.   His group was one of the largest guerrilla factions at the startof the civil war, but it has since dwindled for lack oforganization. It has never received the amount of external supportfrom the United States, Pakistan and other countries that thepowerful, hard-line groups do.   Shah, a U.S.-educated engineer, is a top political officer in thehard-line Ittehad-i-Islami guerrilla group. His group is the weakestof four fundamentalist, Pakistani-based guerrilla factions.   He was designated in early 1988 as prime minister of a guerrillagovernment that never became functional.   The nearly 400 council delegates cheered ``Allah-o-Akbar'' (Godis Great) when the nominations were announced, indicating Sunday'svote will be a formality.   The Consultative Council, or shura, started its meetings inIslamabad on Feb. 10 to form what its leaders say will be the futuregovernment of Afghanistan.   The Moslem guerrilla forces and many Western diplomats say theMarxist government of President Najib, based in Kabul, will soonfall now that Soviet troops have withdrawn from Afghanistan. Najibsays his troops can hold on without the Soviet soldiers.   The council spokesman said Mohammadi will serve, by virtue ofbeing president, as head of the presidium. That ruling body willconsist of a leader of each of the seven factions in thePakistani-based guerrilla alliance.   The president will be appointed for eight months, the spokesmansaid at a news briefing today.   The prime minister and president will jointly present a list ofproposed Cabinet ministers to the council Sunday, the final day ofthe council session, Sayyaf said.   He added that an elected council will be formed within sixmonths, but he gave no details of those elections. He said the newcouncil will in turn name a president and ratify the interim Cabinet.   The council had been bogged down over differences onpower-sharing between the seven groups in the Pakistani-basedresistance. Iranian-based guerrilla groups are boycotting thesession, demanding 100 seats in the council.   The guerrillas fought a nine-year war against the Soviets andAfghan troops.</TEXT></DOC>
