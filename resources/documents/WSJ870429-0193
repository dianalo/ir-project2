Neither the results of the EPA staff report nor our review can be construed as providing &quot;ammunition&quot; for &quot;opponents&quot; of acid-rain controls. We have asserted only that current quantitative estimates of impacts of acidic deposition exhibit wide uncertainties, which reflect the preliminary nature of the research effort.    The report was an interim effort to summarize current progress within the EPA Aquatic Effects Research Program to assess the impacts of acidic deposition on aquatic systems. These studies are not sufficiently advanced to produce rigorous quantitative estimates of aquatic effects, and thus are not suitable currently for judgments one way or the other.    Geoffrey G.
