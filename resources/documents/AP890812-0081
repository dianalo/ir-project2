But as the three-week Edinburgh Festival of music, theater anddance opens, organizers are asking what the future holds for the43-year-old chronically underfunded event.   A policy committee has been set up for the first time to discusswider issues than what shows to put on, including the festival'sdirection in the next 10 years, said Frank Dunlop, festivaldirector for the last seven years.   ``It seems to me that unless it can be creatively expanded andlook at itself afresh, it will become moribund,'' he said in aninterview, adding, ``I don't think I'm becoming moribund, althoughsome might think I am.''   Dunlop is a short, stocky, gray-bearded Englishman, the son of aPolish-Latvian shoemaker's daughter and a Scottish engineer.   He was associate director of the National Theater under LaurenceOlivier, founded the Young Vic youth theater and worked in New Yorkas a successful director.   He searches constantly for unexpected delights for the festival,including in other years a hilarious Canadian comedy about oldmovies and a Japanese ``Macbeth'' performed in white body stockings.   This year has much that is Spanish _ Spanish opera, puppets,ballet, theater and the National Orchestra of Spain.   Dunlop said he hadn't had time to read one prominent Londonnewspaper article suggesting he is ready to quit because he wasdispirited about the future of the festival.   Money is a continual problem. The Edinburgh Festival has alwaysbeen underfunded and the city fathers never built the opera housethat was pledged after World War II.   ``I spend more time appealing for money than anything else,''says Dunlop. ``The festival is costing $4.8 million this year, andwe should be spending $6.4 million.''   Festival visitors will spend at least $64 million in the nextthree weeks, but the city _ especially its businesses _ isnotoriously parsimonious, he said.   Local authorities and the government this year will providearound $2 million in subsidies and commercial sponsors give another$800,000. The rest comes from the box office, advertising revenueand sales.   In the last month, Dunlop was stunned when the festival founditself $16,000 short of the money needed to set up an exhibitionabout tartan history and fashion, sponsored by a U.S. trust fund.   ``Not a single Scottish sponsor was interested, but we finallyscraped it together,'' he said.   Still, he said, ``We know that Edinburgh wants the festivaldespite the hunger of Glasgow and London to kidnap it and thesniping from down south that Edinburgh doesn't deserve it.''   Dunlop said in the past five years the festival has become moreinternational, with companies from Eastern Europe, Japan and SouthKorea participating. This year the festival also includes theHouston Ballet and Martha Clarke dance company from the UnitedStates.   ``We now must try to get the South and Central Americans here.It must become a festival of innovation if it is to makeprogress,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
