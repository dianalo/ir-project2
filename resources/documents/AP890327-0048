The Operation Rescue protesters spent Easter behind bars,sometimes singing hymns, refusing to take the legal steps thatwould have allowed them to leave jail because they wanted todramatize their cause.   The group's jailed leader, Randall Terry, spent part of the daycalling journalists to complain that they failed to show picturesof aborted fetuses that might show the public what abortion reallyentails.   He opened the New York-based group's Holy Week protests Thursdayby appearing at a news conference with a small, white coffin thatcontained what he said was an aborted 19-week-old fetus. Afteropening the coffin lid he left, challenging the media to televisethe remains.   ``The media is the greatest perpetrator of this holocaustbecause they're hiding the truth from the public,'' Terry saidSunday. ``It's not a matter of taste. The majority of the mediaelite are pro-death and reduce this to a war of words, and it's awar of bodies, dead bodies.''   The protesters are the latest of more than 21,000 to be arrestednationally since 1987, mostly for blocking clinics where abortionsare performed.   As part of their effort to focus attention on the SupremeCourt's reconsideration of its 1973 decision legalizing abortion,252 men and at least 50 women stayed in jail Sunday by refusing toprovide their names to police or to sign misdemeanor trespassingcitations.   Terry, a former car salesman, and three others could face moreserious charges: They remained jailed today for investigation offelony conspiracy to encourage others to commit a crime.   ``This felony charge is a joke,'' he said. ``How can you have afelony conspiracy to commit a misdemeanor trespass? That'sludicrous.''   He alleged Los Angeles police used excessive force when theyarrested 750 protesters during a six-hour standoff outside a clinicSaturday. More than 1,000 anti-abortion activists were arrestedduring three days of protests in Cypress, Long Beach and LosAngeles.   Officers' treatment of protesters, he charged, ``was completelyuncalled for and unprofessional. You don't twist people's arms tothe point were they're screaming in pain and sticking two fingersup their nose.''   One demonstrator's arm and wrist were broken in a scuffle withpolice Saturday, Operation Rescue said. Los Angeles police Cmdr.William Booth said Sunday that the group was exaggerating theincidents.   Police Chief Daryl Gates said officers used a ``pain compliancehold'' in the arrests. And he said he would ask the city attorneyto sue Operation Rescue for the $60,000 to $100,000 thedemonstration cost the city.</TEXT></DOC>
