Government records show that miners were ordered to retrieveinstruments from tunnels filled with radioactive dust andcontaminated debris soon after nuclear blasts at the Nevada TestSite, The New York Times reported.   According to the minutes of a Sept. 23, 1952, meeting of theAtomic Energy Commission, predecessor of the Department of Energy,``The commissioners expressed concern that workers might be exposedto radiation hazards for too long a time.''   Two weeks later, the commissioners were told that the programfor determining how much radiation hundreds of workers were exposedto was not reliable, the Times said.   By the following May, some commissioners were calling forreduction of worker exposures by lowering the government's annualsafety limit, which was 12 rems, or radiation doses.   Dr. John C. Bugher, the AEC's chief health officer at the time,advised against lowering the limit, saying it ``would make itimpossible to conduct operations at the test site without majorchanges.''   Today the annual safety limit is 5 rems.   The government documents were made available to the newspaper byLas Vegas lawyers Alan R. Johns and Larry C. Johns, who allege in alawsuit against the government that radiation from bomb testscaused the cancer deaths of 200 Nevada Test Site employees andcancer illness in 18 others.   In the 1950s, workers cleaned up rubble at detonation siteswithout respirators to protect their lungs, the Times said.   On Nov. 24, 1961, 108 miners were pulled from two tunnels afterthey absorbed doses exceeding safety limits. The miners wereoffered as much beer as they could drink for a week to flush thecontaminants from their bodies, the Times said.   On June 6, 1963, 13 miners who had been clearing rubble from atunnel on the night shift were found to be contaminated byradioactive iodine produced by a test in the tunnel the day before.Miners on the next shift were ordered to continue work in thetunnel despite the contamination, the Times said.</TEXT></DOC>
