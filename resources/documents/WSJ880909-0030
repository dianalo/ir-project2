However, Chronar said success of the project depends on the availability of financing on favorable terms. It added that whether certain investors provide financing may depend on the continuing availability of tax benefits related to renewable energy sources.    Chronar, a Princeton, N.J., maker of solar panels, expects construction of the 50-megawatt plant to begin in late 1989 and to be completed in 1992. The plant, to be located in the Lancaster-Palmdale area of California, would sell electricity to Southern California Edison Co, a unit of SCEcorp.    Chronar said the partners plan to sell the power station to investors. Profits or losses from the project would be shared equally between Chronar and SeaWest, a closely held San Diego company that has developed projects involving wind turbine generators. </TEXT></DOC>
