Judge Jay C. Walman of Philadelphia on Monday denied amotion to dismiss the case against Ortho PharmaceuticalCorp., a subsidiary of Johnson andamp; Johnson of New Brunswick,N.J., and Dr. Albert M. Kligman, the inventor of Retin-A. Dr.Kligman developed Retin-A while working as a researcher andprofessor at the University of Pennsylvania School ofMedicine.</LP><TEXT>   The plaintiff in the case, University Patents Inc., is alicensing agent for the University of Pennsylvania.University Patents filed the suit in 1989, claiming that allinventions developed by the school's faculty or researchersbelong to the school.   In the suit, University Patents, Westport, Conn., isdemanding profits from the sales of Retin-A and a right tolicense the drug, which is often used to slow the developmentof wrinkles. The plaintiff contends that Dr. Kligman wasbound by a legal theory of implied contracts and argues thatas an employee he was bound by rules set forth in theuniversity's written policies and handbooks governingresearch done under its auspices.   In their pretrial court motions, the defendants said thereis no evidence Dr. Kligman, now retired, was required toassign his Retin-A rights to the university becauseemployment policies and handbooks generally are not bindingunder Pennsylvania law. They also said that patent courtsusually do not recognize implied contracts.   Judge Walman, however, ruled that there was enoughevidence of an implied contract to warrant a trial.   &quot;This is a close case, particularly in view of the mannerin which the University conveyed its Patent Policy and itslax enforcement thereof,&quot; the judge said in his opinion.   Arthur M. Lieberman, an attorney for University Patents,said his client stands to gain a considerable piece of theestimated &quot;$1 billion to $3 billion&quot; potential market forRetin-A. Mr. Lieberman also said the case could have a broadimpact because almost all universities have patent policiessimilar to the University of Pennsylvania's policy.   Rich Salem, a spokesman for Ortho, said the company isconfident it will prevail in court.   ---   FUGITIVE MARC RICH is ordered to pay $6.3 million indamages to two traders.   In a suit that has been pending since Mr. Rich fled theU.S. in 1983, U.S. District Judge Thomas P. Griesa ofManhattan awarded Action S.A., a Paris-based grain trader,and Deltamar Establishment, of Lichtenstein, compensatorydamages plus interest and $500,000 in punitive damages.   The companies had accused Mr. Rich of a fraudulent schemein connection with a 1981 grain shipment from India to Italy.In 1988 Judge Griesa granted the plaintiffs' request for adefault judgment against Mr. Rich. Since then attorneys forboth sides have been battling over damages.   &quot;My clients are gratified that they were finallyvindicated and that Mr. Rich was not able to escape judgmentsimply by running away,&quot; said Daniel Beller, of the New Yorklaw firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton andamp; Garrison, whichrepresents the European firms.   Mr. Rich's lawyer, Richard Hoffman of the Washington lawfirm Williams andamp; Connolly declined to comment. And Mr. Richcould not be reached for comment. The commodities trader haslived in Zug, Switzerland, since he was indicted for taxevasion.   Mr. Beller said his clients' Swiss lawyers will be giventhe responsibility of collecting the damages from Mr. Rich.However, it is unclear whether the plaintiffs will evercollect any money.   ---   REINSURER ORDERED to pay asbestos damages despite latenotice on claims.   A federal judge in Manhattan ruled that under New Yorkstate law, reinsurers -- who essentially insure otherinsurance policies -- have less protection than directinsurers.   Attorneys for the reinsurer, Unigard Security InsuranceCo., had argued that the company should be treated just as adirect insurer in interpreting a policy. Under New York statelaw, for instance, a direct insurer doesn't have to providecoverage if it doesn't receive timely notice of a claim.   Unigard, a Seattle-based unit of John Hancock Mutual LifeInsurance Co., maintained that because the direct insurerdidn't give it timely notice of asbestos personal-injuryclaims, Unigard didn't have to pay. The direct insurer wasNorth River Insurance Co., a subsidiary of Crum andamp; ForsterInc. of Basking Ridge, N.J. Unigard is no longer in thereinsurance business.   Judge Robert Sweet ruled, however, that the timeliness ofnotice is less important to reinsurers. He said the purposeof the timely notice law was to protect direct insurers, whoneed to investigate claims immediately for fraud. But, JudgeSweet said, &quot;Reinsurers simply don't face the type ofirreparable harm which threatens direct insurers in case ofuntimely notice of a claim.&quot;   Judge Sweet also said that Unigard never showed that itwas damaged by the untimely notice.   The judge also rejected Unigard's claim that it didn'thave to pay some damages that weren't specifically covered bythe reinsurance contract.   ---   RECORD FINE in deceptive-advertising case upheld.   The appellate division of the New York State Supreme Courtupheld a $206,600 award to New York City's Department ofConsumer Affairs in the agency's suit against Manhattanlawyer Leo Raychuk. It was the largest fine the agency hasever levied against an individual and the first suit theagency has brought against a lawyer for deceptiveadvertising.   The suit, filed in 1988, alleged Mr. Raychuk ran more than400 ads making deceptive claims, including that he couldroutinely obtain divorces in 10 days. Mr. Raychuk couldn't bereached.   &quot;This tells all lawyers that they are free to advertisebut only if they comply with the same laws about truthfuladvertising as all other providers of services,&quot; said MarkGreen, the city's consumer affairs commissioner.   Mr. Raychuk had argued that only the judicial branch isallowed to regulate lawyers. But the appellate court ruledthat attorney advertising falls within the department'sjurisdiction.   Since 1987, 48 other lawyers have been cited by thedepartment for deceptive ads. All of them have settled.   ---   AUTOGRAPH FORGERIES law is proposed.   New York State Attorney General Robert Abrams is seekingthe law to stop a rising tide of forgeries in the estimated$1.5 billion-a-year industry of autographed sportsmemorabilia.   The proposed law, which would be the first of its kind inthe nation, would require dealers to provide certificates ofauthenticity to buyers of autographed baseballs, baseballcards and other memorabilia, Mr. Abrams said at a newsconference. The certificate would identify the sold item andlist the place and date that the sports personality signedit. Dealers who violate the law would be liable for payingcustomers triple damages.   According to some dealers, about 40% of autographed sportsmemorabilia sold to customers is fraudulent, Mr. Abrams said.He provided no dollar estimate of the fraud. Some autographsare fetching hundreds of thousands of dollars. In MarchSotheby's Holdings Inc., the auction house, sold $4.6 millionof memorabilia, including a Mickey Mantle baseball card for$49,500.   Separately the National, a sports newspaper, yesterdayreported that the Federal Bureau of Investigation isconducting a sting operation involving the sale of fraudulentsports memorabilia. According to the newspaper, FBI agentshave solicited baseball greats Ted Williams, Joe DiMaggio andMr. Mantle to help identify forged signatures.</TEXT></DOC>
