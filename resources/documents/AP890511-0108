The Bush aide, Donald Gregg, the president's nominee to beambassador to South Korea, will face questions about theIran-Contra affair at a confirmation hearing Friday before theSenate Foreign Relations Committee.   North, who was convicted of three of 12 charges last week,testified during his trial that he spoke to Gregg in 1985 about theefforts of a retired CIA agent named Felix Rodriguez working in ElSalvador to assist an air re-supply operation to the Contras.   Did National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane ``know about Mr.Rodriguez's mission?'' prosecutor John Keker asked North.   ``Yes, I believe he did,'' North testified. ``In fact, I believethat once I had talked to Mr. Gregg about it, I talked to Mr.McFarlane about it, about the fact that he would be able to assistin that country.''   Gregg testified in a sworn deposition to the congressionalIran-Contra committees in 1987 that he did not know until an August1986 meeting with Rodriguez that North was helping facilitate themovement of weapons and other lethal aid to the Contras.   In his courtroom testimony, North did not say precisely when hetold Gregg about Rodriguez's mission, but North was responding toprosecutors' questions about a Sept. 20, 1985, letter he wrote toRodriguez.   The ``Dear Felix'' letter says Rodriguez should approach twohigh Salvadoran military officers asking for space at Ilopango airbase to service planes being used to supply the Contra rebels.   At the time, McFarlane and North were preparing false responsesto congressional inquiries by denying that the National SecurityCouncil staff was assisting the Contras. One of the responses saidthat North did not use his influence to facilitate movement ofsupplies to the Contas.   Keker asked North whether he showed McFarlane a copy of theletter to Rodriguez at the time.   ``I don't recall ... but as I indicated a moment ago I was putin touch with Mr. Rodriguez by Mr. Gregg of the vice president'sstaff. I mean, he is the person who introduced me to the man,''North said from the witness stand.   Gregg, a former CIA official, was then-Vice President Bush'snational security adviser during the Reagan administration.   He and Rodriguez had been friends since working together inVietnam.   Gregg said Rodriguez never mentioned his work with the Contraresupply operation until Aug. 8, 1986. Even then, Gregg said hedidn't pass along to Bush Rodriguez's complaints about the way theoperation was being run.   When North's Contra-supply network began to unravel after aplane was shot down over Nicaragua on Oct. 5, 1986, Gregg toldreporters he had never talked with Rodriguez about the rebels. Helater corrected his statement, saying he had forgotten about theAugust meeting.   Gregg also can expect questioning from the Senate panel about asecret plan approved by President Reagan to slip more than $110million in extra aid to Honduras in exchange for supporting theContras.   Bush said last week that his 1985 trip to Honduras was not partof any such ``quid pro quo'' scheme. Documents released at theNorth trial state that Bush discussed extra aid to Honduras, but donot allege that Bush tied the aid to Contra support.   The president said the U.S. government had no quid pro quoarrangement with Honduras ``as far as I know.''   However, a 42-page government-approved admission introduced atthe trial says that in mid-January 1986, the State Departmentprepared a memo for Gregg in advance of a meeting between Bush andthe Honduran president.   ``One purpose of the meeting was to encourage continued Honduransupport for the resistance (the Contras),'' said the document.``The memorandum alerted Gregg that (Honduran President Jose)Azcona would insist on receiving clear economic and social benefitsfrom its cooperation with the United States.''</TEXT></DOC>
