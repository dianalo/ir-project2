With his inauguration about three weeks away, Bush had retreatedfor three days to a 10,000-acre ranch 70 miles from Corpus Christifor an annual stint of quail hunting.   Bush, a keen outdoorsman, teamed up today with a friend, RayScott, for some fishing on Scott's private lake at Pintlala, Ala.Scott is founder of Bass Anglers Sportsman Society and headed Bush's1980 presidential campaign in Alabama.   Before leaving from Chase Naval Air Station, Bush was taking afew minutes for a nostalgic gesture that recalled his days as afighter pilot in World War II.   Bush was to sign his wife's name, Barbara, across the fuselage ofa restored TBM Avenger, a torpedo bomber of the sort he flew in thePacific.   Bush, who named his planes after his then-fiancee, BarbaraPierce, narrowly escaped death when he was shot down on a bombingmission Sept. 2, 1944.   Leo Nadeau of San Diego, Calif., Bush's regular tail gunner onbombing missions, was joining Bush at the fuselage signing ceremony.Mrs. Bush did not accompany her husband to Texas, remaining insteadin Washington to pack for the move to the White House.   The TBM Avenger, one of about 20 of that type left in the world,was restored by Bob Schneider, a Braniff pilot from Hawkins, Texas.Schneider estimated the project, which he did for a hobby, costabout $20,000.   In Pintlala, Bush scheduled about six hours on Scott's privatelake about 15 miles from Montgomery. Scott, a conservationist andlong-time Bush supporter, said the vice president called him toarrange the outing.   ``We just want to get in some fishing,'' he said.   To give him more time for fishing, Bush ordered his departuretime moved up by about two hours today.   Bush didn't have much luck on a post-election fishing trip toFlorida, and he found quail hunting harder than in previous yearsbecause of the dry conditions, Stephen Hart, spokesman for thepresident-elect, said.   ``They have been successful on the hunt, but not as successful asin past years,'' he said.   Bush didn't volunteer how many birds he had bagged, he said.   But Bush was ``very relaxed, very upbeat,'' after the hunting,Hart added.   While Bush was isolated at the Lazy F Ranch, owned by his friend,Houston millionaire Will Farish, his transition office announcedthat he had selected Robert M. Gates, the No. 2 official at the CIA,to be the new deputy director of the National Security Council.   Bush, in a statement, called Gates, an expert on Soviet affairs,``admirably suited for this key position.''   Gates, a Kansas native and a career CIA employee, will report toBrent Scowcroft, who Bush has designated as his national securityadviser. Neither job requires Senate confirmation.   To replace Gates, Bush chose Richard J. Kerr, the CIA's currentdeputy director for intelligence whose background is in East Asianaffairs. The Kerr appointment is subject to confirmation by theSenate.   Bush, while in Texas, was notified in advance about a Britishannouncement that investigators determined a bomb had caused thecrash of a Pan American World Airways plane last week, but he had nocomment on it, Hart said.   Joining Bush on his vacation were Farish and his wife, Sarah,James Baker III, the designated secretary of state, and his wife,Susan, and the president-elect's brother, Jonathan Bush of New York.   Bush has said that when he returns to the nation's capital, hewill concentrate on policy and legislative issues as well as thebudget. He still has one Cabinet job, energy secretary, to fill, andhe is looking for a drug czar, a Cabinet-level job.   Bush has not said when another announcement will be forthcoming,but aides indicated it could be as early as Friday.</TEXT></DOC>
