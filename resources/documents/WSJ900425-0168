RJR, taken private last year in a $25 billion leveragedbuy-out by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., reported briskgrowth in cigarette revenue, mostly because of priceincreases and cuts in overhead costs. Most importantly, RJR'sdebt coverage -- its cash flow as a percentage of totalinterest obligations -- reached 1.14 in the quarter, up from1.04 three months earlier.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;That's pretty good for a first-year LBO of that size,&quot;said Sam DeRosa-Farag, a bond analyst with First Boston Corp.&quot;That's the beauty&quot; of taking a tobacco company privatethrough an LBO: &quot;They're cash cows.&quot;   RJR revenue jumped 9.5% to $3.2 billion from $2.93billion. The growth was paced by a 15% increase in tobaccorevenue, to $1.86 billion from $1.62 billion. Revenue fromfood grew 3% to $1.34 billion from $1.31 billion, whichincludes several units that have been divested in the pastyear.   Louis V. Gerstner Jr., RJR's chairman and chief executiveofficer, said the New York company's results benefited fromRJR's decision last year to end the practice called tradeloading, whereby the company built up huge excess inventoriesamong its cigarette distributors. In past years, RJR's heavyfourth-quarter trade loads had the effect of artificiallydepressing first-quarter tobacco shipments by swampingdistributors shelves, thus making shipments in this year'sfirst quarter seem unusually strong by comparison.   &quot;Nevertheless,&quot; said Mr. Gerstner, &quot;these results alsoreflect strong fundamentals, and there is a growing sense ofmomentum in the company.&quot;   That momentum may have been reflected lately in thesteadily rising price of RJR's publicly traded bonds. RJR'stwo most widely held debentures, the 13.71% pay-in-kind debtdue 2009 and the pay-in-kind debt due 2007, have ralliedseveral points in the past month, on the strength ofanalysts' high expectations for the company's operations andpersistent rumors that RJR may soon buy the bonds back, oroffer some other type of exchange for the debt.   Covenants require RJR to reset the bonds' interest ratesby a year from now so they trade at par, a requirement thatmany analysts agree would be prohibitively expensive atcurrent prices.   Yesterday, the 13.71% pay-in-kind debentures due 2009 rose5/8, or $6.25 for a bond with $1,000 face amount, to close at81 5/8, on the New York Stock Exchange, while RJR'spay-in-kind debentures due 2007 rose 3/4 to 68 1/8.   &quot;They've still got a long way to go,&quot; said Alan Snyder ofSan Francisco-based Snyder Capital Management, aninvestment-management firm that holds some RJR bonds. Thebond prices &quot;are still about 30% or so from where they've gotto be to reset&quot; interest rates.   Karl von der Heyden, RJR's chief financial officer,wouldn't comment on what RJR may do to address the resetrequirement, except to say, &quot;We're always looking at all theoptions.&quot;   RJR said operating profit in the first quarter jumped 50%to $602 million from $402 million. The company's operatingprofit from tobacco rose 40% to $637 million from $453million. Operating profit from food rose 18% to $141 millionfrom $119 million.   Much of RJR's first-quarter growth in operating profitcame from slashing costs, analysts and RJR executives said.In the past year, for example, the company has cut itsheadquarters work force by more than half, said Mr. von derHeyden, to fewer than 300 employees from more than 650. Inthe first quarter, the cost of maintaining the head officefell to $24 million from $46 million a year earlier.   Meanwhile, Mr. von der Heyden said RJR's expenditures onadvertising and marketing rose more than 10% in the period tomore than $700 million. He added, however, that U.S.consumption of RJR cigarettes fell 3% in the quarter,continuing a worrisome trend for the No. 2 U.S. cigarettemaker.</TEXT></DOC>
