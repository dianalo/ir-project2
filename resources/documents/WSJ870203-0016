In a leveraged buyout, a company is taken private in a transaction financed largely with debt. Ultimately, the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or by the sale of its assets.    The purchase of Pizza Inn has been delayed several times by the acquiring company's troubles in lining up funds. Pizza Inn Acquiring Corp., a company formed by F.J. Spillman, chairman of the restaurant chain, said it is continuing to pursue alternative financing sources, but that it &quot;cannot predict when such financing can be arranged.&quot;    The company didn't elaborate on why the talks with the venture-capital firm, which wasn't identified, fell through.    The investor group said Lloyds Bank PLC, London, has extended its commitment to provide $18 million in financing for the transaction through Feb. 28. </TEXT></DOC>
