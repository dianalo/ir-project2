Boone Pickens Jr.'s hostileadvances, will be converted from a Texas master limitedpartnership to a Delaware corporation, known as UnocalExploration Corp.   Unocal said it was making the switch, in part, because ofrecent tax law revisions. Unocal Chairman Richard Stegemeieralso cited &quot;the improving climate for investments in domesticoil and gas exploration and development.&quot; Unocal and itsUnion Oil Co. of California subsidiary hold about 95% of theoutstanding units of Union Exploration Partners.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;A corporation is now generally a more efficient vehiclefor capital accumulation and reinvestment than a publiclytraded partnership,&quot; Mr. Stegemeier said. Earlier this year,Unocal announced a 22% boost in its annual budgeted spendingfor exploration and capital projects.   Union Oil, which acts as managing general partner of UnionExploration Partners, projected in a Securities and ExchangeCommission filing that the change would be effective Aug. 1.It is expected that each outstanding Union ExplorationPartners unit will be converted into a new common share ofUnocal Exploration, which will be traded on the New York andPacific stock exchanges.   Before that, on July 25, a special cash distribution willbe made to Union Exploration Partners unitholders of recordJuly 11. The pay-out will be equal to about 100% of thepartnership's estimated distributable cash for the fourmonths ended July 31. A Unocal spokesman said the companycouldn't speculate on the amount.   Unocal said Unocal Exploration's board intends to declarequarterly common share cash dividends. It said the firstdividend is likely to be 10 cents a share, payable Nov. 15 toshareholders of record Nov. 1.   In addition, Union Exploration Partners unit-holders willbe entitled to an extra cash distribution of up to $3 perunit if, during pre-defined time periods, the average closingprice of Unocal Explorations's common stock falls below$18.20 a share.   Eugene Nowak, oil analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds in NewYork, said the move should give Unocal &quot;more flexibility.&quot; Hesaid Unocal Exploration could become an acquisition vehiclefor Unocal, which has shed much of its debt in recent years.   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, UnionExploration Partners units closed at $16, down $2.25, asinvestors faced the prospect of immediate reduced pay-outs.They have been pocketing from the partnership more than 43cents a unit quarterly for the past year.   Unocal closed on the Big Board yesterday at $28.75, down25 cents.   As of the end of last year, Union Exploration Partnerscontrolled about 29% of Unocal's total U.S. proved reservesof crude oil and about 59% of its U.S. proved reserves ofnatural gas.</TEXT></DOC>
