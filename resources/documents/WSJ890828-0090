The award, which provides for delivery of the tanks in the 1990s, is the second part of a procurement program that began with a $500-million award to the aerospace and defense contractor in June 1988. Under prior awards, 52 external tanks have been manufactured.    The huge tanks, which aren't reusable, carry liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen oxidizer used to propel the orbiter during liftoff and ascent. The tanks will be produced by the company's Manned Space Systems unit at NASA's Michoud assembly plant near New Orleans. </TEXT></DOC>
