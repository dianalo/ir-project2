As previously reported, the bill, initiated by the conservative-minded government of Premier William Vander Zalm, would limit certain union powers and establish an Industrial Relations Council that can end strikes and lockouts and impose settlements without the consent of management or labor.    The bill must still be officially proclaimed before it becomes law. A government spokeswoman indicated that proclamation could take place in July.    The 250,000-member British Columbia Federation of Labor, which earlier this month organized a one-day general strike against the bill, said it plans to boycott the new council. Cliff Andstein, a spokesman for the labor group, said further strike action isn't planned, but he added that the federation will support unions facing &quot;compulsive or coercive action&quot; as a result of the bill. A ban on overtime work and a campaign of working strictly to the letter of collective bargaining agreements will continue, he said. </TEXT></DOC>
