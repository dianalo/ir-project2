Gen. Richard Secord and close aides as the Iran-Contra affair became public last fall.    The exact date of the incident remains in dispute, but two of Gen. Secord's employees, Shirley Napier and Joan Corbin, initially testified that the papers were shredded in early December after the Justice Department began an inquiry into the controversy. Ms. Napier subsequently revised her account to say the shredding occurred in November, and her affidavit indicates it could have occurred the same day that Attorney General Edwin Meese was directed to begin a preliminary inquiry into the brewing scandal.    President Reagan ordered the investigation Nov. 21, and prior testimony has established that within hours of that decision, National Security Council staff members began altering and destroying White House papers related to the Iran-Contra operation. The documents shredded at Gen. Secord's office included telexes and papers related to his involvement in the operation. The general has said the incident occurred before even the preliminary inquiry began and, that no papers were destroyed to obstruct the federal investigation.    Testifying under grants of immunity, Ms. Napier and Ms. Corbin were cross-examined by House and Senate investigators in April. The transcripts released yesterday include information that has since been covered by other witnesses in public testimony. Still, the depositions are revealing in terms of Gen. Secord's relations with figures in and out of the Reagan administration.    Noel Koch, who resigned a year ago as the Pentagon's deputy assistant secretary for international security affairs, appears to have had regular meetings with Gen. Secord, and David Walker, a British special operations veteran known to both men, was also in contact with the general's office.    Another figure, former Central Intelligence Agency agent Glenn Robinette, is identified in the testimony as a security consultant to Gen. Secord's company in suburban Virginia. Ms. Napier recalled five or six checks being paid to Mr. Robinette for security consulting; the checks described generally totaled between $5,000 and $6,000. But she also testified to a $2,000 payment this year that corresponds to the cost of an automatic gate, which was paid for by Mr. Robinette and installed in 1986 on the Virginia property of former White House aide Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North.    Mr. Robinette is expected to testify next week under a grant of immunity voted by House and Senate committees investigating the Iran-Contra affair. Investigators are pursuing evidence that the former CIA officer was paid to provide services benefiting Col. North. Gen. Secord's company, Stanford Technology Trading Group, was largely dependent during this period on funds generated by the Iran-Contra operation. A major question is whether these monies were being surreptitiously used to benefit Col. North, who was overseeing the covert arms sales.    Ms. Napier, who has had a longer association with Gen. Secord than Ms. Corbin, often served as a courier between Col. North and the private network. In August 1986, she picked up $16,000 in cash in Miami and delivered it to the White House for Col. North.    During a trip with Gen. Secord to London in March 1986, she testified that he met with Mr. Walker, whose private security firm, KMS Ltd., has ties to the Thatcher government. KMS provided personnel for the covert airlift of arms to the Contras.    The depth of Mr. Walker's involvement with Col. North remains unclear, but he also was known to Mr. Koch. As former deputy assistant secretary for defense, Mr. Koch had worked with Col. North and Gen. Secord, and was instrumental in the awarding of Pentagon work to a firm controlled by another Secord associate, retired Air Force Lt. Col. Richard Gadd. Col. Gadd was part of the arms network.    After retiring from the military in 1983, Gen. Secord served for a period on a special operations advisory panel used by Mr. Koch when he was at the Pentagon. According to intelligence sources, companies linked to Gen. Secord performed clandestine operations on behalf of the government. The new testimony indicates that Gen. Secord and Mr. Koch maintained contacts well after the general's involvement in the advisory group ended. (Pentagon officials said Gen. Secord stopped attending meetings in late 1985.) Ms. Corbin recalled &quot;fairly&quot; frequent phone calls between the men and &quot;at least a half dozen&quot; occasions when Mr. Koch came to the general's Virginia offices.    Efforts to reach Mr. Koch yesterday were unsuccessful, but he is among the witnesses the committees may call when the hearings resume next week. </TEXT></DOC>
