 Oceanographic chemists were hard pressed to come up withgood, readily-obtainable reference data.andP;  Until August 1988, they would havehad to wait several weeks to get the data (stored in a variety of formats)from the National Archives in Washington D.C.andP;  Now, thanks to the efforts ofthe National Oceanic andamp; Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), chemists can accesstheir own copy of the Alaskan Marine Contaminants Database with their officePC and a CD-ROM player.andM;The Alaskan Marine Contaminants Database (AMCD) development project is led byNancy Nicolaison of NOAA's Office of Ocean Assessment in Anchorage.andP;  Morethan two years ago, the Alaskan NOAA office decided that oceanographicchemists and researchers needed a comprehensive, locally accessible databaseon marine contaminants.andP;  There was a wealth of data from past studies ofmarine contaminants, but no one had compiled the data in any readilyaccessible form.andP;  The potential size of the data set made distribution aproblem.andP;  NOAA soon realized that the only affordable solution to thisproblem lay with CD-ROM technology.andM;Early in the project, Nicolaison decided that the contaminants databaseneeded to be &quot;kind and forgiving to the uninitiated computer user.&quot;andP;  Thus,armed with the Microsoft C compiler, the Microsoft Windows SoftwareDevelopment Kit, and &quot;a pile of Advil,&quot; Nicolaison started writing the userinterface.andP;  Her choice of Microsoft's C compiler was closely tied to herdesire to work in the Windows environment.andP;  &quot;It would be suicidal to use anon-Microsoft comiler for developing in Windows,&quot; she said.andP;  She consideredtechnical support from Microsoft very good.andM;Nicolaison was virtually certain of what the front end should look like, butthe specification for the back end was a little vague.andP;  Initially, she usedR-Tree (Faircom Corp.), but it was abandoned after three months due to itspoor documentation and incompatibility with Windows.andP;  After looking at otherpotential products and toying with the idea of writing the back end in C,NOAA settled on a relatively new product called db VISTA III from Raima Corp.andM;Nicolaison chose db VISTA III for three reasons: the quality of documentationand training; the availability of a royalty-free runtine system; and the factthat Raima was soon to release a Windows-compatible version of the product(released in early 1989).andP;  The quality of the documentation and training wasimportant, because NOAA had decided to contract out for two components of thesystem: the retrieval engine development and the data entry and databaseloading.andP;  The distribution cost was a special concern because the AMCD systemrequired $1,000 worth of CD-ROM hardware over and above the cost of the286-based computer (based on 1986 prices).andM;How does the system work?andP;  A map of the Alaskan coast appears on the screenand users initiate queries to the AMCD database by selecting an area ofinterest on the map with a rubber-band-like tool and making selections from aseries of Windows &quot;list boxes.&quot;andP;  Users specify the desired fields in one listbox, and the scope of the query is narrowed by selecting choices inadditional list boxes.andP;  Items, like species (e.g., halibut), type of sample(liver tissue), contaminant (crude oil), and, perhaps, quality of datatolerated (ranging from 0=poor to 4=excellent), are specified with a fewclicks of a mouse.andP;  The AMCD front end then sends the spatial and list boxdata to the retrieval engine as a set of coordinates, list of selectedfields, and series of &quot;Boolean arrays.&quot;andM;The AMCD retrieval engine, also written in Microsoft C by Charles Tang,interprets the data passed to it by the front end and constructs a &quot;retrievalpath&quot; to the data in the network-based db VISTA III database.andP;  The retrievalengine uses C calls to interface with the db VISTA database and passes theresults of the query back to the front end, where the data can be printed orsent to another file.andM;Both Tang and Nicolaison have experience with the network database model,which db VISTA is based on.andP;  Nicolaison says that the network model is anefficient method for storing the data and feels that a similar databasedeveloped with a relational database management system (DBMS) would probablybe 150M (as opposed to the 60M in db VISTA III).andP;  The schema, or datadictionary, consists of 10 different record types (the network DBMSequivalent of a table), five sets (user-specified owner-member relationshipsbetween the record types that minimize data redundancy) and three key files.andO;The database contains about 90,000 records collected from 30 contaminantstudies.andM;For Nicolaison, the most difficult part of the development effort wascreating the user interface without knowing what the final database was goingto look like.andP;  She got around this by developing a series of Boolean arraysthat turned out to be an efficient way to represent the user's query whilemaintaining independence from the eventual DBMS.andP;  Similarly, Tang had todevelop parts of his system without knowing the final structure of thedatabase.andP;  An additional problem he ran into was Window's dynamic memoryallocation.andP;  Many of his data access routines, originally developed outsideof Windows, had to be rewritten to meet Window's unusual memory constraints.andM;Nicolaison found one drawback in using db VISTA III.andP;  The program optimizesits key files for a dynamic, changing database by padding the key files withempty space to make room for updates.andP;  NOAA's database, however, will bedistributed on CD-ROM, which will make it static.andP;  Nicolaison would like toable to close the gaps left in the key files to minimize storage requirementsand maximize performance.andP;  Raima has been working with NOAA to make thisoption possible.andP;  It's made easier by the fact that for an extra $500, RaimaCorp will provide the source code of db VISTA III to developers.andP;  In fact,Nicolaison has nothing but praise for the company's technical support staff.andO;&quot;Raima has taken a real interest in making our system work,&quot;, she said.andM;How many people will eventually use the Alaskan Marine Contaminant Database?andO;Originally, NOAA estimated there would be around 20 copies of the databasedistributed to oceanographic chemists working for NOAA.andP;  Due to the recentoil spill in the Prince William Sound, NOAA now projects that they'll haveover 100 users of their database--with the majority of users outside of theagency.andP;  The typical user is an oceanographic chemist or toxicologist needingto look at historical data concerning a specific contaminant in a boundedarea of the Alaska coastline.andP;  In the Prince William Sound, this data will beused to assess damage from the oil spill to the ecosystem.andP;  NOAA distributesthe AMCD package, consisting of the database on CD-ROM, the program on floppydisk, and a printed manual--free.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
