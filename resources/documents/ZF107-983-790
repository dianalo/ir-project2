profit for 1990 on the back of the stringentcost-cutting measures taken this year; the company is expected to report aloss after write-offs of about $650 for 1989; much of the profit will have togo towards lowering the company's excessive debt burden - a debt-to-equityratio of over 50% including Unisys' finance subsidiary, 40% excluding it;Unruh hopes to get the latter figure down to between 30% and 35% by the endof 1990, he told the Wall Street Journal.andM;- o -andM;NBI Inc, Boulder, Colorado has now defaulted on its $34m of 8.25% convertibledebentures due 2007: it had warned that it might not make the $1.4m interestpayment due on November 15 and it is now discussing means to restructure itsdebt.andM;- o -andM;That string of acquisitions has propelled Misys Plc into the Financial Timeslist of the 500 biggest UK public companies for 1989 at number 375: also inis Peek Plc at number 400, but dropping out is MBS Plc; the ranking is bymarket capitalisation, so is dependent on the performance of the share price;at the top end of the table, British Telecommunications Plc is toppled fromthe top spot by British Petroleum Plc, GEC Plc climbs to nine from 15; Cableandamp; Wireless Plc to 11 from 16; and Reuters Holdings Plc leaped to 14 from 45;Racal Electronics Plc is up five places at 30.andM;- o -andM;Cap Gemini Sogeti SA has made four more acquisitions - affiliates Aptor SAand Apsis SA in France; Accept Data AB in Sweden; and Detroit, Michigan-basedindustrial consultant Merit Systems Inc in the US; no financial details weregiven.andM;- o -andM;British Rail received a visit the other day from the Union Internationale desChemins de Fer, the international association of railway boards, which sentdown an Integrated Services Digital Network working party to see ademonstration of Horsham, West Sussex-based Ericsson Ltd's MD110 privatebranch exchange in a multi-vendor environment; the demonstration formed partof Ericsson's on-going efforts to promote the use of the DPNSS signallingstandard for digital private networks, a standard developed some time ago byBritish Telecommunications Plc in conjunction with the private branchexchange suppliers.andM;- o -andM;France's CNET - Centre National d'Etudes des Telecommunications - is claimingthe world record for current density through what are essentiallytwo-dimensional lasers - their width being no more than 1.5 nanometres (ananometre is a millionth of a millimetre): in a test carried out by theCentre in France, a current density of 640 amperes per square centimetre wasrecorded through a material based on phosphorus indium; CNET says thepractical application of this performance is expected to be for long-distanceoptical fibre transmission at speeds of several Gigabits per second overtelecommunications networks of the future.andM;- o -andM;Barclays Bank Plc has gone to BBN Communications to provide the final Pacificlink for its global communications network in a deal worth $500,000 to theWest Drayton, Middlesex packet-switching networkers: the new network centresin Hong Kong, Sydney and Tokyo are each linked via two BBN C/300 PacketSwitching Nodes, with further C/3 nodes installed in Singapore, Aukland andWellington, and a planned connection to the Seoul office; the networkextensions complement Barclays existing Worldwide Network, which is basedaround BBN's switching nodes, processors and packet assemblers-disassemblersfor con-nection to non-X25 user equipment.andM;- o -andM;ATandamp;T Bell Laboratories says it has developed a photonic integrated circuitwith the highest capacity yet reported: the opto-electrical device is claimedto process two 2K-bits of optical data in parallel, twice that of any otherphotonic integrated circuit; it is a single Gallium Arsenide chip with 2,048elements, each element a symmetric self electro-optic effect device that canfunction as a logic gate, a memory cell, or a switch.andM;- o -andM;The agreement between CBE Computer Brokers Exchange NV and the ATC Bluebirdnetwork to exchange information and databases is terminating on January 11990: both parties say that a rising dollar has depressed the number ofdeals, and the CBE says that of 300 US brokers, only 10% are interested inEuropean developments; ATC intends to establish toll free lines in Europe bythe end of January which will allow dealers to transmit information directlyto the US: CBE's satellite service has also been criticised, partly becausethe varied European regulations make access difficult and inconsistent; therehas been speculation that the service will close, leaving CBE with itslargely mail-dominated subscriber services.andM;- o -andM;If anyone is puzzled that &quot;Five Years Ago&quot; alongside should suddenly havelost a year, it's simply that for some unaccountable reason the things havebecome three days out of sync - it's back to five years on January 2; ithappens...andM;- o -andM;Correction: the Dolphin Server Technology A/S 88000 RISC-based Triton-88machines were developed by the Norsk Data A/S subsidiary in-house - it is the68030-based Uniline 33 boxes, sold only outside Scandinavia, that come OEMfrom Motorola (CI Nos 1,288, 1,324).andM;- o -andM;What's a cemetery? Xephon's splendid Handbook of IBM Terminology (CI No1,330) reveals that it is IBMspeak for a bureaucratic non-job into which anolder member of IBM staff has been shunted - there's no way out other thanretirement, and refers the reader to the entry under Cooling House, alsocalled a Parking Lot, both names for the same non-job into which a youngerIBMer has been shunted - there's hope if you're under 45, but after thatthere is only the cemetery!andO;</TEXT></DOC>
