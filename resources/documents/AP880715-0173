More than 1,600 of the popular but endangered fish, weighing atotal of more than 8,000 pounds, were illegally bought and sold,said officials of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department.   ``This may be a greater crime than the theft of money or goods,because when redfish are gone, they can never be replaced,'' saidCapt. Jim Robertson, supervisor of coastal law enforcement for thedepartment. ``Every redfish illegally taken from the Texas coastalwaters is something stolen from every Texan, not only today but forfuture generations.''   Commercial fishing for redfish has been illegal in Texas since1981. Texas was the first state to protect redfish, but now statesfrom Texas to North Carolina have passed laws to protect thespecies from over-harvesting, officials said.   Last year, the National Marine Fisheries Service prohibitedtaking of redfish from federal water, leaving the northern coast ofMexico from the Texas border to Vera Cruz as the only place redfishcan be taken commercially, said David Cottom of the wildlifedepartment.   All the illegally caught redfish, plus some spotted sea trout,were caught in the Seadrift area on the Texas Gulf coast.   Robertson said it took about a year for the game warden toestablish himself as a fish dealer. The actual sting operation ranfor about two months, beginning in April.   ``It's going to be continuing. We're going to start anotherone,'' he said.   ``We certainly hope they're a little more careful and hope theyabide by the regulations,'' Robertson said. ``The message today toall who illegally sell or buy redfish is that we take thatresponsibility (to protect the fish) very seriously.''   The game warden bought fish from fishermen, then called orvisited buyers. All transactions were conducted without any of thedocumentation required to sell redfish imported from other statesor countries, and both sellers and buyers knew it, Robertson said.   The problem of illegal fishing is widespread, he said.   ``This involved 10 fishermen in one small area. There's manysmall fishing villages like that on the Texas coast. It could bemassive,'' he said.   The charges filed in the case were various grades ofmisdemeanors carrying penalties that include substantial fines andup to a year in jail. In addition, some violators could be assessedcivil penalties with a charge for each fish bought illegally.Restitution costs could top $160,000, officials said.</TEXT></DOC>
