By a single X-ray exposure a density pattern on the test filmis produced the evaluation of which permits to quantitatively determinethe light cross-over of the front and back screens, the sensitivity asymmetriesof the two emulsion layers of the test film, and the light emission asymmetriesof the front and back screens. This is achieved by using test screenswith a specific pattern of fluorescent and non-fluorescent areas havingthe same reflection, and inserting a halved film leaf in such a way thatpermits multiple determination of the sought quantities from the distanceof the characteristic curves.</TEXT></DOC>
