They're gathered in a kitchen that only four years ago was filled with Democrats eager to meet presidential candidate John Glenn. But on this wintry afternoon when the air is filled with the smell of homemade cinnamon buns, Doris Van Sickle, once the Boone County Democratic women's chairman, is surrounded by her new allies -- political novices eager to meet Marlene Elwell, the Michigan housewife who has organized the Midwest for the former religious broadcaster.    There is an elementary-school teaching assistant who has never been to a political caucus but who is organizing five precincts for Mr. Robertson. There is a couple who operate a livestock farm and educate their five children at home rather than entrust them to the local public school. There is a clerk from a local discount store who worries that &quot;the basic morality of our country is eroding.&quot;    Here in rural Iowa, where Pat Robertson has tended the political grass roots, there is a different sort of activist -- political newcomers who, with the help of Mrs. Elwell, are out to shake up next month's political caucuses, the Republican party and the country.    Many of them have no formal church affiliation. Some of them live beyond the reach of cable television and have never seen one of Mr. Robertson's religious broadcasts. Half of them say they have spoken in tongues. They're worried about the future of the farm and the family. They're mistrustful of the press -- they're angry, for example, that Time chose Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev as its Man of the Year -- and they're skeptical of politics.    &quot;I've never had a real high opinion of politics,&quot; says Dave Hill, an Army National Guard recruiter. &quot;I don't like the trading and the wheeling and dealing. I see Pat Robertson as a regular person, not as a politician or a man of God.&quot;    Many of them are like Mrs. Elwell, a mother of five who was so nervous about getting involved in politics that she took a confidence course seven times. Today, however, she is what Mr. Robertson calls &quot;one of the two or three best field operatives in the nation&quot; and the Midwest regional director for the campaign.    She comes to places like Boone to encourage Mr. Robertson's supporters, almost all of whom describe themselves as nonpolitical, to have the resolve not only to attend the GOP caucuses just over three weeks away, but to organize their regions -- and more. Not long ago she flew to Rapid City, S.D., and met with fewer than two dozen people in a restaurant. While they were toying with their eggs, she slipped away, booked the convention center for Pat Robertson, returned to the restaurant and told her listeners they had to get 1,000 people to the event. They got 1,300.    &quot;Politics is a frightening thing for some people,&quot; she says. &quot;They're secure in their homes. They don't think they're smart enough. They don't know how to argue with people who disagree with them. They wonder if they'll be able to keep their emotions in check. Taking that leap is a big, scary risk.&quot;    Several of those gathered in the Van Sickle kitchen are ready to take that leap, and Mrs. Elwell reminds them that the 2,493 precinct caucuses Feb. 8 require a massive effort and personal commitment. &quot;You can't win without detailed organization, and that's our game,&quot; she says. &quot;We can organize better than anyone.&quot;    Not everyone believes, however, that Mrs. Elwell and the people in the Van Sickle kitchen are going to be able to shed their reluctance to participate in such a public political event as an Iowa precinct caucus.    Many of the Robertson supporters were rural before they were religious, and some experts like Don Hadwiger, a specialist in rural politics at Iowa State University in nearby Ames, still wonder whether the Robertson backers will flood the caucuses. &quot;Going to a caucus goes against every impulse of their normal behavior,&quot; he says. &quot;A caucus is a confrontational event in someone's living room, and these are not confrontational people.&quot;    But the Robertson supporters want to shape the U.S. political and social agenda much the way 19th century evangelicals did with the abolition, temperance and prison-reform movements.    &quot;It may seem quaint, but they feel they are putting themselves on the line as the last resisters to communism,&quot; says Randall Balmer, a Columbia University historian of American religion who was raised in Iowa. &quot;This movement is not an alien phenomenon, it's a return to an American political norm after a half century of sulking.&quot;    The Robertson supporters who gathered in the Van Sickle kitchen here believe that, as Katie Mickle, the discount-store clerk says, &quot;we're at a crossroads, and we have a unique opportunity to solidify what this country was founded on.&quot;    They're more sad than angry about the state of the country. &quot;The patriotism of our nation has been replaced by greed and lust,&quot; says Mrs. Van Sickle. Ernie Behn, a livestock and grain farmer in nearby Madrid adds: &quot;This is a great country. It just isn't done yet.&quot;    Some of them are Methodists, some Lutherans, some belong to a small countryside Bible chapel and some to no church at all. Some, like Mrs. Van Sickle, have undergone what she calls the &quot;private, sacred and blessed&quot; experience of speaking in tongues. They share a belief in God -- but little else.    Mrs. Elwell, who is Catholic, says that many of the Robertson supporters she helps organize around the country are religious but not, as she puts it, &quot;religious nuts,&quot; adding: &quot;These are everyday normal people who believe in God, country and family. They go to church on Sunday but they don't carry Bibles under their arms and don't stand on a platform in a public park and preach and aren't out to convert the world on the street corner.&quot;    &quot;We know we aren't kooks,&quot; says Jerry Behn, 33 years old, who works the farm with his father and who is organizing four precincts for Mr. Robertson.    The Bible provides their zeal, not their programs. &quot;We are Christians and we believe the Bible,&quot; says Polly Rinehart, who teaches her five children, all under the age of nine, in her farmhouse rather than send them to school. &quot;We have to do more than pray. The Lord put us here for a reason.&quot;    Indeed, the Robertson supporters here say they don't emphasize religious topics in their organizing efforts. &quot;We stay away from the religion,&quot; says Ran Henricksen, who retired after 38 years with a natural gas transmission company. &quot;We talk about the issues. We talk about a balanced budget, not God.&quot;    (See related story: &quot;...While Candidate Stays True to Form by Spreading the Word, and the Words&quot; -- WSJ Jan. 15, 1988)</TEXT></DOC>
