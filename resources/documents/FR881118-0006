Provisions for attainment date extensions to December31, 1987, were available for ozone if States could demonstrate that, despitethe implementation of all reasonably available control measures (RACM),the 1982 attainment deadline could not be met. States failing to demonstrateattainment by December 31, 1982, were required to submit revised SIPs byJuly 1, 1982 (1982 SIP). Lake and Porter Counties were designated nonattainment for ozone on March3, 1978 (43 FR 8962), and, thus, Indiana was required to submit a PartD ozone plan for the area. The State of Indiana submitted its 1979 ozone(and carbon monoxide (CO)) plan on June 26, 1979, and provided supplementalsubmittals on: May 19, 1980; September 24, 1980; October 9, 1980; and October15, 1980. The June 26, 1979, SIP submittal requested that UEPA extend theozone attainment deadline to 1987 for Lake and Porter Counties, the Indianaportion of the Chicago-Gary-Hammond urban ozone demonstration area,\1\<NOTE/> and committed to submit a supplemetal 1982 ozone plan forthis area. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The Chicago-Gary-Hammond urban 1982 ozone demonstrationarea (also sometimes referred to hereinafter as the greater Chicago areaor the Chicago area) consists of Lake and Porter Counties in Indiana andCook, DuPage, Kane, Lake, McHenry, and Will Counties in Illinois. Highestozone levels resulting from emissions from this area were found in Racineand Kenosha Counties, Wisconsin, and Lake County, Illinois. The USEPA approved or conditionally approved portions of Indiana's 1979plan in four rulemakings: January 2, 1981 (46 FR 36); February 11, 1982(47 FR 6274); October 22, 1982 (47 FR 47552); and January 18, 1983 (48FR 2124). On February 11, 1982 (47 FR 6274), USEPA approved Indiana's requestto extend the ozone attainment deadline for Lake and Porter Counties toDecember 31, 1987. On September 2, 1982, Indiana submitted a draft version of its 1982 supplementalPart D ozone plan. Subsequent versions and partial modifications were submittedon: December 2, 1983; February 8, 1985; July 3, 1985; and December 13,1985. The USEPA proposed rulemaking on the draft version of the 1982 supplementalPart D ozone plan on February 3, 1983 (48 FR 5106), following a commentletter sent to the State on November 10, 1982. The USEPA proposed additional,related rulemaking on: August 3, 1983 (48 FR 35316); October 9, 1984 (49FR 39574); January 21, 1986 (51 FR 2732); and April 7, 1986 (51 FR 11576).On January 26, 1987, USEPA proposed to: (1) Disapprove Indiana's TCP, unlessthe State provided additional supporting information; (2) defer actionon the vehicle inspection and maintenance (I/M) portion of the Indianaplan; and (3) approve Indiana's ozone attainment demonstration for Lakeand Porter Counties. This proposed approval of the attainment demonstrationwas based on (1) Indiana's adoption of Illinois' analysis of Volatile OrganicCompound (VOC) emission reduction requirements necessary in the Chicagoarea; \2\<NOTE/> and (2) Indiana's commitment to adopt sufficient VOC emissioncontrol measures in Indiana to achieve the percentage emission reductionrequirement. The USEPA proposed to disapprove Indiana's ozone attainmentdemonstration if the State failed to adopt the necessary VOC emission controlmeasures prior to USEPA's final rulemaking.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ VOCs photochemically react with other substances in theair to form ozone. The Illinois Environmental Protection Agency determinedthrough ozone modeling that a VOC emission reduction of 46 percent froma 1979 baseline emissions level in the Chicago-Gary-Hammond urban demonstrationarea was required by 1987 to attain the ozone NAAQS in the demonstrationarea and its downwind environs.Following the January 26, 1987, proposed rulemaking, USEPA continued toreview the Indiana ozone plan. These reviews were consolidated and summarizedin a Technical Support Document (TSD), dated April 15, 1987. This TSD evaluatedthe status of the State's adoption and implementation of its stationarysource Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) regulations for controlof VOC emissions and reviewed the implications of the most recent 3 years(1984-1986) of ozone air quality data. USEPA concluded that full RACT regulationadoption and implementation were unlikely to occur by December 31, 1987,in Indiana (and Illinois) and that, based on air quality and VOC emissionsestimates, the ozone NAAQS was unlikely to be attained by December 31,1987, in the Chicago-Gary-Hammond area or downwind in Southeastern Wisconsin.USEPA received additional Transportation Control Measure (TCM) materialson May 14, 1986, June 10, 1986, March 30, 1987 and April 6, 1987. In accordancewith the January 26, 1987 proposal, these documents were to provide: (a)Sufficient documentation to support the basis for choosing to implementcertain TCMs for the purposes of VOC emission reductions in Lake and PorterCounties, pursuant to section 108(f) of the Act; (b) a commitment to providea yearly assessment of implemented TCMs in these two counties, includingtechnical analysis of emission reductions resulting from the implementationof each measure or group of measures; (c) discussion of how the basic transportationneeds of these counties were being met, including funding provisions andcommitment for such needs; (d) sufficient documentation to support emissionreduction benefits for the TCMs included in the State's 1982 TCP for Lakeand Porter Counties (these TCMs include speed limit review, placing trafficsignals on flash at certain lightly traveled intersections, removing unnecessarystop signs, carpooling, and vanpooling); and (e) a list of planned transportationmeasures and projects that might adversely affect air quality and thatwould be delayed if expected emission reductions or air quality improvementsdo not occur. In a TSD dated May 13, 1987, USEPA reviewed the informationsubmitted by the State. USEPA concluded at that time that the State hadprovided all requested information and documentation concerning its TCP.Based on its continuing review of the status of Indiana's adoption of VOCcontrol measures and of the more recent ozone air quality data for theyears 1984-1986, USEPA changed its position on the approvability of Indiana'soverall ozone plan. On July 14, 1987 (52 FR 26439), USEPA proposed to:(1) Approve Indiana's TCP because the State had resolved the deficienciesnoted in the January 26, 1987, proposed rulemaking; (2) approve the I/Mportions of the Indiana plan, except for the I/M portions dealing withthe funding of the enforcement elements of the program; (3) disapproveIndiana's ozone attainment demonstration for Lake and Porter Counties;and (4) find that Indiana's Lake and Porter Counties ozone plan as a wholedid not adequately demonstrate attainment of the ozone NAAQS by the endof 1987 or a fixed near term date, and, therefore, did not meet the requirementsof Part D of the Act.\3\<NOTE/> Based on a lack of an acceptable ozone attainment demonstration,USEPA proposed to implement a construction ban on new and modified majorVOC sources in Lake and Porter Counties under section 110(a)(2)(I) of theAct. (USEPA also proposed to disapprove Indiana's plan for Floyd and ClarkCounties and impose the construction ban there. USEPA will take furtherrulemaking action on Floyd and Clark Counties in a future notice.)<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ USEPA discussed the legal rationale for its disapprovalof the Indiana ozone plan for Lake and Porter Counties in its General Preambleto the various SIP proposals issued on July 14, 1987. See 52 FR at 26404-26410.A number of comments were received by the USEPA regarding its July 14,1987, proposed rulemaking. It is the purpose of this final rulemaking torespond to the public comments, to present information on relevant Indianasubmittals subsequent to the July 14, 1987, proposal, and to announce USEPA'sfinal rulemaking action. (USEPA will repropose rulemaking on the I/M portionof Indiana's plan in a future <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice.)Since the proposed revised rulemaking on July 14, 1987 (52 FR 26439), USEPAhas conducted reviews of Indiana's subsequent submittals which relate tothe Indiana ozone plan for Lake and Porter Counties, Indiana. These reviewswere consolidated and summarized in USEPA TSDs dated December 7, 1987,July 5, 1988, and September, 1988. The December 7, 1987, TSD reviewed publiccomments and suggested revisions to the rulemaking action, as appropriate,in response to the public comments. The July 5, 1988, TSD reviewed peakozone concentrations for 1985 through 1987 for worst-case monitoring sitesin the Chicago area and its downwind environs. USEPA concluded in the July5, 1988, TSD and in a further addendum of September 1988, that, based onthe magnitude and number of monitored exceedances of the ozone standardin Southeastern Wisconsin, violations of the ozone standard in the Chicagoarea would continue well beyond the 1987 attainment deadline, even if allof the stationary source RACT and I/M measures, that Illinois and Indianawere to adopt as a part of their plans, were fully adopted and implementedin the near term.<ITAG tagnum="84">Comments on the Proposed Rulemaking</ITAG>The following summarizes and responds to all public comments received inresponse to the July 14, 1987, proposed rulemaking on Indiana's Lake andPorter Counties ozone plan. Comments relating to the Indiana vehicle I/Mprogram and Clark and Floyd Counties will be addressed in separate rulemakingactions.<T3>Comment: </T3>As part of its basis for a SIP disapproval, USEPA citesviolations of the ozone NAAQS in Southeastern Wisconsin, with violationsbelieved to be due to emissions from the Chicago-Northwest Indiana area.USEPA proposed a major source construction ban in Northwest Indiana. Theproposed construction ban in Northwest Indiana is expected to have littleimpact on ozone concentrations in Southeastern Wisconsin, because Chicagois currently under a construction ban, which has had little effect uponair quality in Northwest Indiana.<T3>Response: </T3>As the commenter notes, there currently exists a constructionban on new and modified major sources of VOCs and CO which are locatedin the Illinois portions of the greater Chicago area designated nonattainmentfor these pollutants.\4\<NOTE/> It is impossible to determine precisely the impact this constructionban has had on air quality conditions in the Chicago area.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ Prior to today, EPA's imposition of the section 110(a)(2)(I)construction ban was due solely to the lack of an approved Illinois PartD new source review program. EPA's disapproval today of the Illinois SIPfor ozone in the Chicago area now serves as an additional basis for theconstruction ban or new and modified sources of VOCs, however.Moreover, USEPA believes that, regardless of impact it must impose a constructionban on new and modified major sources of VOCs in Lake and Porter Counties,because it is disapproving the Indiana ozone plan for this area. Section110(a)(2)(I) of the Act requires that each SIP prohibit the constructionor modification of major sources of pollution in any nonattainment areawhose SIP does not meet the requirements of Part D to Title I of the Act,sections 171-177. On July 2, 1979 (44 FR 39471), USEPA published a regulationthat inserted the section 110(a)(2)(I) construction ban into SIPs thatlacked them and clarified the scope of bans in SIPs that had them.Under section 172 of the Act, Indiana's ozone SIP for Lake and Porter Countieswas required to provide for attainment of the ozone NAAQS by December 31,1987. Since USEPA has today decided that Indiana's plan did not providefor attainment by the statutory deadline or any fixed near-term date beyondthe deadline, the plan does not meet the requirements of Part D. The section110(a)(2)(I) construction ban on new or modified sources of VOCs locatedin Lake and Porter Counties therefore must be imposed.<T3>Comment: </T3>The USEPA is warranted in disapproving the Indiana plandue to the State's administrative failure to adopt regulations coveringcoke oven by-product recovery emissions control. The USEPA, however, isnot warranted in imposing third-party source construction bans as the solutionto an administrative problem.<T3>Response: </T3>See the response to the previous comment.<T3>Comment: </T3>A commenter questioned the consistency of USEPA's actions.On January 26, 1987 (52 FR 2728), USEPA proposed to approve Indiana's ozoneattainment demonstrations for Clark, Floyd, Lake, and Porter Counties,based on the State's commitments to adopt sufficient VOC control measuresto achieve the ozone NAAQS by the end of 1987. On March 13, 1987, the IndianaDepartment of Environmental Management (IDEM) submitted its non-CTG RACTrules for marine vessel surface coating and wood furniture/cabinet coatingto the USEPA for parallel processing. The rule had been preliminarily adoptedby the Indiana Air Pollution Control Board (IAPCB). The State is progressingtoward fulfilling its commitments to develop acceptable VOC control rulesunder its 1982 SIP revision.USEPA`s July 14, 1987, proposed rulemaking appears to prejudge Indiana'sability to meet the State's commitments by the end of 1987 or a fixed nearterm date. The commenter believes USEPA's July 14, 1987, proposed actionis premature and inconsistent with previous proposals, especially giventhe State's recent progress.<T3>Response: </T3>USEPA acknowledges that it proposed to approve Indiana'sozone attainment demonstrations for Lake and Porter Counties on January26, 1987 (52 FR 2728), and then on July 14, 1987 (52 FR 26442), proposedto disapprove these demonstrations. This reversal in positions was dueto the availability of new ozone air quality data for the Chicago areathat persuaded USEPA that, even when VOC control measures adopted priorto July 1987 were considered, VOC emissions in Indiana would not be reducedenough to provide for attainment of the ozone NAAQS by December 31, 1987,or any near-term date thereafer. The July 14, 1987, proposed rulemaking(and today's final disapproval of the ozone attainment demonstrations forLake and Porter Counties) does not in any way prejudge Indiana's abilityto ultimately adopt rules that will provide for attainment and maintenanceof the ozone NAAQS.It is true that during the past 15 months Indiana has continued to submitstationary source RACT rules to USEPA that will, when implemented, resultin further VOC emissions reductions. However, the 1985 through 1987 ozoneair quality data confirm that attainment by a near-term date and maintenancewill not occur with only the measures that Indiana and Illinois have previouslycommitted to adopt and implement in the near term. Based on this, on May26, 1988, USEPA issued a notice of SIP deficiency under section 110(a)(2)(H)of the Act to Indiana for ozone for Lake and Porter Counties.<T3>Comment: </T3>The IDEM commented that it would maintain an expeditioustrack for final resolution of deficient elements in its ozone plan. IDEMpresented the following schedule for rule development and promulgation:<T3>Limitation of Benzene Emissions from Coke Oven By-Product RecoveryPlants: </T3>This rule was preliminarily adopted by the IAPCB on July 1,1987, and submitted to the USEPA for parallel processing on July 17, 1987.IDEM reviewed public comments from a hearing held on August 26, 1987. Theprovisions of the rule were to be presented for final IAPCB adoption onNovember 4, 1987. Following final IAPCB adoption on November 4, 1987, therule was to be sent to the USEPA as a SIP revision.Indiana postponed rule development for coke oven by-product recovery plants,in anticipation of Federal adoption and promulgation of a National EmissionStandard for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) rule for this source category.This promulgation is behind schedule. Even though USEPA's delay is notcause for Indiana's inaction, any State attempt to develop a parallel setof rules for these plants would no doubt be frustrated by the potentialfor inconsistency with any eventual Federal rule and by the complexityof these plants. Nevertheless, Indiana did adopt and will initiate implementationof a coke oven by-product recovery plant rule. Although it was not possibleto implement the controls required by the rule before December 31, 1987,the State believes it is requiring emission reductions as expeditiouslyas practicable. <T3>Response: </T3>As IDEM noted, any delay in promulgation of a federalNESHAP for coke oven by-product recovery plants did not excuse Indianafrom placing emission controls on these sources of VOCs (or other sourcesof VOCs with equivalent reductions) by December 31, 1987. Indiana submittedits coke oven by-product recovery plant rule to USEPA on April 11, 1988.(This rule will be the subject of future rulemaking by USEPA.) Even ifthe rule is fully approved, however, recent ozone air quality data demonstratethat the resulting decrease in VOC emissions from these sources will notlower Indiana VOC emissions sufficiently to provide for attainment andmaintenance of the ozone standard in the greater Chicago area in the near-termfuture.<T3>Comment: </T3>A final disapproval of Indiana's 1982 ozone plan seemsto be inconsistent with the likely contents of USEPA's post-1987 ozonepolicy, which will recognize good faith efforts.<T3>Response: </T3>USEPA has not yet published its final policy on treatmentof areas that did not attain the ozone NAAQS by December 31, 1987, thestatutory deadline. USEPA is currently reviewing public comments on itsproposed post-1987 ozone policy, which was published on November 24, 1987(52 FR 45044). It is therefore impossible to judge the contents of thefinal policy.Contrary to the commenter's suggestion, however, USEPA's disapproval ofthe attainment demonstration (and, therefore, the plan) for Lake and PorterCounties is fully consistent with the proposed policy. USEPA stated inthe proposed policy that it ``believes that the Act permits USEPA to grantfull approval to a plan * * * only if it includes a persuasive demonstrationthat the affected area will attain the relevant standard by a fixed datein the near term.'' See 52 FR 45049, col. 3. The Indiana ozone plan failedto provide for attainment of the NAAQS in the Chicago area by December31, 1987, nor does it contain a persuasive demonstration that the areawill attain the standard in the near-term, with maintenance thereafter.Thus, USEPA's action to disapprove the Indiana ozone plan is not inconsistentwith the proposed post-1987 ozone policy.<T3>Comment: </T3>A commenter noted that, through the promulgation processfor the proposed National Emission Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants(NESHAP) for coke oven by-product recovery plants, Indiana has abdicatedmost of its responsibility for the Lake and Porter Counties' ozone SIPto the Federal Government. Such an action does not constitute reasonableand satisfactory progress. Therefore, it recommended that USEPA take allavailable steps to obtain the required VOC reductions.<T3>Response: </T3>USEPA agrees that Indiana's delay in adopting emissionscontrols for VOC emissions from coke oven by-product recovery plants hasimpeded progress in reducing VOC emissions in the State. Indiana did, however,adopt a coke oven by-product recovery rule on February 3, 1988, and submittedthe rule to USEPA for its approval on April 11, 1988. USEPA currently isreviewing the rule, and will decide upon its adequacy in a separate rulemakingin the future.<T3>Comments: </T3>A commenter requested that its comments submitted inresponse to USEPA's January 26, 1987, proposed rulemaking on the IndianaSIP, be incorporated with comments on the July 14, 1987, proposed rulemaking.These incorporated comments are summarized as follows:a. Based on Indiana's failure to achieve a sufficient VOC emission reductionto attain the ozone NAAQS by December 31, 1987, it is recommended thatUSEPA disapprove the Lake and Porter Counties' ozone plan.b. If the Indiana plan is disapproved, USEPA should impose sanctions againstLake and Porter Counties.c. USEPA, under section 110(c) of the Act, should promulgate an approvableozone control plan for Lake and Porter Counties.d. Tardiness on the part of Indiana to develop an approvable plan for NorthwesternIndiana, as well as USEPA's lack of diligence in assuring that Indianacomplete its SIP development, raises significant doubts about attainmentof the ozone NAAQS by December 31, 1987.e. The ozone demonstration of attainment for Lake and Porter Counties isoverwhelmingly based upon the Federal promulgation of a NESHAP for cokeoven by-product recovery plants. The 95,316 kilograms of VOC/day emissionreduction projected to occur between 1979 and 1987 for this source categoryis 80 percent of the 1979 through 1987 VOC emission reduction in Indianarequired to attain the ozone NAAQS in Lake and Porter Counties. There isno assurance that the NESHAP will be promulgated by USEPA in time to assureattainment of the NAAQS. In addition, USEPA anticipates that almost allaffected facilities will apply for a waiver of up to 2 years from compliancerequirements. Northwest Indiana will realize little, if any, VOC reductionfrom the Indiana plan's predominant control measure by the 1987 attainmentdeadline.f. The Indiana Air Pollution Control Board (IAPCB), in an October 25, 1985,letter to the USEPA, states that, should a delay occur in the USEPA promulgationof the coke oven by-product recovery plant NESHAP, Indiana would ``committo evaluate and adopt, as necessary, a mix of control strategies to assurethat the required (VOC emission) reduction would be achieved.'' The IAPCBlisted the potential control strategies as State regulation of coke ovenby-product recovery plants, Stage II vapor recovery (gasoline service stationvehicle refueling emissions), expansion of the applicability of currentVOC RACT rules to smaller sources, control of consumer solvent use, andcontrol of architectural surface coating emissions. However, mid-March1987 discussions between IAPCB and USEPA indicated that Indiana had yetto take any action on any of these strategies, despite USEPA's delay inpromulgating the NESHAP. The State had committed to evaluate and adoptalternate control measures if USEPA did not promulgate the NESHAP by January1986. The commenter questions the original intent and sincerity of Indiana'sSIP commitments.g. In an October 22, 1985, submittal, Indiana takes credit for emissionreductions from RACT III and RACT IV (major source non-CTG RACT). The commenterquestions the legitimacy of this emission reduction credit because theState has yet to develop rules for any RACT III or RACT IV sources in Lakeand Porter Counties.h. The October 22, 1985, submittal lists VOC emission credits from stationaryand area source emissions inventory decreases. The commenter believes thisclaim runs counter to the development of a SIP that accommodates growth.A Reasonable Further Progress (RFP) report must document such emissiondecreases. No such documentation exists at this time. An RFP report isrequired by the Act. Approval of the Indiana plan without this documentationis not acceptable.i. Full source compliance with any VOC control rule before December 31,1987, is a prerequisite to claiming VOC reduction credits for the ozoneSIP. The VOC control commitments contained in an October 25, 1985, Indianasubmittal will not be fulfilled before the attainment deadline.j. Indiana decided to abdicate much of its ozone SIP development responsibilityfor Lake and Porter Counties to the Federal Government by allowing theproposed NESHAP for coke oven by-product recovery plants to become theoverwhelmingly major VOC control strategy for these two counties. However,when this regulation failed to materialize in a timely fashion, Indianahas not taken the initiative to follow through on the necessary commitmentsmade in an October 25, 1985, submittal. (This is similar to point f. above.)k. Based on available evidence, the commenter was convinced that the Indianaplan's attainment demonstration could not be met by the December 31, 1987,deadline date. The commenter recommends that the entire Indiana 1982 ozoneplan for Lake and Porter Counties be proposed for disapproval based onthe State's failure to comply with sections 110 and 172 of the Act. Itappears that Indiana may act to correct its plan if the USEPA proposesto disapprove the SIP revision.<T3>Responses:</T3> a. As indicated in the July 14, 1987, proposed rulemaking,further evaluation of 1984 through 1986 ozone concentrations in the Chicagoand southeastern Wisconsin area led the USEPA to conclude that the ozonestandard would not be attained in the Chicago-Gary-Hammond ozone demonstrationarea, which includes Lake and Porter Counties, Indiana, until well afterDecember 31, 1987. Peak ozone concentrations monitored during the timeperiod 1985 through 1987 at worst case sites in the greater Chicago areashowed that the 1-hour ozone standard has been violated in the 3 most recentyears of quality-assured data collection. The magnitude of the exceedances,particularly those monitored in the City of Waukegan (Lake County, Illinois),Racine County (Wisconsin), and Kenosha County (Wisconsin), are such thatUSEPA does not expect the ozone NAAQS to be attained in the Chicago areaby any date in the near-term future. Thus, USEPA must disapprove Indiana'sozone plan for Lake and Porter Counties.b. In its July 14, 1987, proposal disapproval of the Indiana plan, USEPAproposed to impose a construction ban on new and modified sources of VOCsin the non-attainment areas, as is required by section 110(a)(2)(I) ofthe Act. Consistent with that proposal, USEPA is imposing the constructionban in Lake and Porter Counties with today's notice. USEPA believes thatthe imposition of other sanctions (based on the other alleged State failuresto which the commenter refers) is not appropriate at this time, but iscontinuing to evaluate the necessity for these sanctions.c. USEPA is currently a defendant in a lawsuit brought by the State ofWisconsin, in which Wisconsin seeks an order requiring USEPA to promulgatea federal implementation plan (FIP) under section 110(c) of the Act forthe Indiana and Illinois portions of the Chicago nonattainment area. See<T3>Wisconsin v. Thomas,</T3> Civil Action No. 87-C-0395 (E.D. WI). Basedon USEPA's disapproval of the Indiana ozone plan today for failure to providefor attainment of the ozone NAAQS and on USEPA's May 26, 1988, issuanceof a notice of SIP deficiency, USEPA believes it now could begin work preparatoryto promulgating a FIP for the Indiana portion of the Chicago nonattainmentarea. In any case, however, the question of whether USEPA should proceedwith a FIP for this area is outside the scope of today's rulemaking.d. As noted in the July 14, 1987, proposed rulemaking, USEPA believes thatIndiana's delay in adopting and implementing required VOC control measuresis partially responsible for the greater Chicago area's failure to attainthe ozone NAAQS by December 31, 1987. This belief has been substantiatedby 1985 through 1987 monitoring data cited in the USEPA TSD dated July5, 1988.e. USEPA agrees that the NESHAP for coke oven by-product recovery plantswas not promulgated in time to assist in attainment of the ozone NAAQSby December 31, 1987. USEPA also agrees that it is possible that the cokeoven by-product recovery plant facilities affected by the NESHAP or byIndiana's non-CTG RACT rule may apply for a temporary waiver from compliancewith either rule. However, rulemaking on USEPA's NESHAP is on a substantiallyslower path than Indiana's rule and will not affect the Indiana plan (norattainment of the ozone standard) in the near future. Further, althoughno source to date has requested a delay in implementing Indiana's rule,the rule does not require final compliance with all of its requirementsuntil December 31, 1990, and, thus, did not provide needed emission reductionsby December 31, 1987. USEPA will rulemake on Indiana's coke oven by-productrecovery plants rule in future notices.f. USEPA sees little to be gained by questioning the original intent ofIndiana's SIP commitments. USEPA, however, does agree with the commenterthat Indiana has failed to carry out many commitments made in its finallyadopted SIP revision dated October 25, 1985, in a timely fashion.g. USEPA agrees that the emission reductions claimed for RACT III and majorsource non-CTG RACT in the Indiana plan (which are essentially those fromthe coke oven by-product recovery plant rule) were not fully achieved byDecember 31, 1987, and still have not been achieved to date. This failureis one of the reasons why USEPA is disapproving Indiana's demonstrationof attainment today.h. USEPA disagrees that the lack of an RFP report is an adequate basisfor the disapproval of an ozone SIP revision. A SIP revision provides aplan and related commitments for a future attainment of a NAAQS. An RFPreport is needed <T3>after</T3> a SIP is adopted to track the progress towards attaininga NAAQS. An RFP report may point toward needed mid-course SIP revisions.Indiana has submitted annual air quality reports. Such air quality reportsmay be a component of RFP reports, which should also track emission changes.i. USEPA disagrees that full source compliance with a VOC control rule,prior to December 31, 1987, is a prerequisite for accepting a claimed emissionreduction credit. Delay in compliance simply delays when credit for anemission reduction can be applied towards an ozone demonstration of attainment.Such a delay can jeopardize an approval of a demonstration of attainmentby causing a delay in NAAQS attainment beyond a specified deadline. USEPAagrees that many of the VOC emission control commitments made in Indiana'sOctober 25, 1985, submittal were not fulfilled by December 31, 1987. Further,even when these reductions are obtained, ozone data from 1985-1987 indicatethat the greater Chicago area will still not attain the ozone NAAQS withoutfurther reductions. This is one reason why USEPA is disapproving Indiana's1982 ozone plan today. Also, USEPA notified the Governor of Indiana ofthe SIP's inadequacy by issuing a notice of ozone SIP deficiency undersection 110(a)(2)(H) of the Act for Lake and Porter Counties, <T3>inter alia,</T3> on May 26, 1988.j. USEPA agrees. See responses f and g, above.k. USEPA agrees that it must disapprove the Indiana ozone SIP revisionfor failure to provide for the attainment and maintenance of the ozoneNAAQS by the December 31, 1987, deadline or any other fixed date in thenear-term. This is the action proposed by USEPA on July 14, 1987, and madefinal today.<ITAG tagnum="84">Vehicle Inspection and Maintenance   (I/M)</ITAG>This portion of the Indiana plan will be addressed in separate rulemaking.<ITAG tagnum="84">Final Rulemaking Action</ITAG>In consideration of Indiana's 1982 ozone plan and the public comments receivedin response to USEPA's July 14, 1987, (52 FR 26439) proposed rulemaking,USEPA takes the following final actions.1. Indiana's Ozone Transportation Control Plan is approved.2. The ozone attainment demonstration for Lake and Porter Counties, Indianais disapproved.3. The overall ozone plan for those counties is disapproved. (USEPA isretaining, however, its previous approval of the various individual measuresin the Indiana ozone SIP, because they are effective means to limit VOCemissions and, thus, minimize the frequency and magnitude of ozone violationsin the greater Chicago area. These measures remain federally enforceable.)4.
