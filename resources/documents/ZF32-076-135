And how can a single administrator manage hundreds of suchenvironments, each with its own configuration and peculiarities? In fact, noone can.andP;  The pc world is moving towards what we used to call a mainframeenvironment.andP;  Now we call it enterprise-wide computing  - a legitimatedistinction because the systems used aren't mainframes, even though theadministration problems are similar.andP;  Indeed, the problems are tougher,because there are usually different systems and configurations for eachindividual user, whereas once all users had identical terminals.andP;  (And ofcourse there were fewer users anyway; mostly, people just got reports fromthe dp center.) Thus, neither pc operating systems nor dp facilities arereally equipped for the enterprisewide environments of today.andP;  Novell and DRI- United we standandM;Juan:           What's the difference between mergers and open-systemsandM;alliances?andM;Alice:          Mergers produce products; alliances produce paper.andM;That's basically  why we're more excited about the merger of Novell andDigital Research than about the latest open-systems alliance or standardscomedy.andP;  Right now, Novell owns the network and the server, while Microsoft or DRI  - owns the client.andP;  This division made a lot of sense when pcs werestandalone and when servers were hosts that ran terminals, but no longer.andO;Now the dissonance between the two sides is the bane of every user's andevery administrator's life.andP;  Client/server is a fine ideal but you can't justplunk any client and any server down together.andP;  The whole idea is to givethem complementary interfaces so that they're insulated from each other andthe promise  - any client with any server  - can be real.andP;  That's the promiseof openness: that if everyone adheres to standards they will get globalinteroperability.andP;  In practice, the attention to joint detail required toimplement such interoperability is usually found only within a single companybuilding two complementary parts, or when a market standard emerges and othervendors struggle to develop complementary (and competitive) products.andP;  ThusDRI/Novell stands to gain an edge in a market where NetWare takes precedenceover DOS (since it solves the more complex problems), and where DR DOS can beengineered to work better with NetWare.andP;  This means everything from avoidingthe inevitable conflicts when two products are developed separately, to morefundamental resonances across the client/server divide.andP;  For example, saysDRI DOS product marketing director John Bromhead, &quot;From the user's point ofview they should have the same interface, the same commands and logicallayout.andP;  Why should it be different to rename a directory across the networkand at your own machine?&quot; From the administrator's point of view, thereshould be more fundamental similarities in the underlying systems and howthey're managed.andP;  For example (and note that this is DRI talking, not Novellimposing its will on its tiny new toy), there are things you just can't donow in DOS  - auditing, communications management, and so on.andP;  The classdistinction between clients and servers disappears In the long run, therewill be no operating-system distinction between client and server.andP;  (That'swhat peer-to-peer and objects are all about.) Any machine can act as a clienton behalf of its own user, or as a server to some other machine on the systemthat makes a request of it.andP;  Typically, a request might ask for some data,but it could also be for use of some other system's or person's softwarepackage.andP;  Administrative tools will also work over the network, as describedearlier.andP;  (In this case, the administrator is actually acting as a client ofthe pcs which do the work.) What are the other benefits of an integratedclient/server operating system? Mostly they are negative benefits  - fewerobstacles to doing the things you want to do.andP;  Why, for example, can you notuse a modem or a CD-ROM or any of hundreds of other peripherals from a serverjust as you use it on a single machine? In principle, there's no reason, butsomehow they're lacking a network driver and can't be run over the network.andO;Says Novell's director of NetWare Products marketing John Edwards: &quot;If itwere just one thing we could have done it with MS-DOS already.andP;  But it's alot of little things.andP;  You just have to do them all.andP;  Our goal is to do itonce, to be able to hold it up and say, 'See what I mean.'&quot; Then, he hopes,the benefits will be clearer and the company will be able to provide the sameintegration benefits with other client systems and with SunSoft's Solaris.andO;That may be a noble but unreachable goal.andP;  Certainly, the difficulty ofachieving workable client/server operation is a strong point in favor of themerger.andP;  Total seamlessness is going too far On the other hand, we're notarguing that system resources should be invisible.andP;  Even though you don'twant to know how your car works, you do want to know whether you're going tooslow, running out of gas, etc.andP;  In the same way, networks can usefully informpeople of the resources they're consuming:andM;Yes, you can get this piece of information, but do you realize we need to getit from Japan and it will take 20 minutes to search the database?&quot; Or,&quot;Sorry, you can't use this because we're only licensed for eight copies.andO;Would you like to see a list of the other users?&quot; Or, &quot;There are two printersavailable: Do you want fast and cheap, or slow and high-quality?&quot; These kindsof messages require both plumbing and high-level self-awareness - orself-description.andP;  The network and the operating system interface may knowabout the printers, but does your vp application know how to tell you? Canyour operating system tell what your application is trying to do? In the end,not even the ideal operating environment goes far enough; the applicationshave to be in on it too.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
