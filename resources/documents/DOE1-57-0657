With the propercompounds, PET can be used to measure metabolism, blood flow, or otherphysiological values in vivo. The technique is based on the physics ofpositron annihilation and detection and the mathematical formulationsdeveloped for x-ray computed tomography. Modern PET systems can providethree-dimensional images of the brain, the heart, and other internalorgans with resolutions on the order of 4 to 6 mm. With the selectivityprovided by a choice of injected compounds, PET has the power to provideunique diagnostic information that is not available with any other imagingmodality. This is the first five reports on the nature and uses of PETthat have been prepared for the American Medical Association's Councilon Scientific Affairs by an authoritative panel.</TEXT></DOC>
