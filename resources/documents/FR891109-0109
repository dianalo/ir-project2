The former workers also stated that they werecertified earlier under TA-W-17,731 and should be reconsidered for benefitsunder the Trade Act as amended by the Omnibus Trade and CompetitivenessAct (OTCA) of 1988.The investigation findings show that the Amarillo facility serviced theother facilities of Santa Fe which produced crude oil and natural gas.The Amarillo facility encompassed an accounting function, corporate records,a data processing center and land administration. Although the Amarilloservice workers were certified eligible to apply for adjustment assistanceunder TA-W-17,731 which expired on November 7, 1988 that certificationwould not act as a precedent for the certification of workers in 1989.The conditions necessary for certification of the Amarillo workers weremuch different in 1986 when TA-W-17,731 was issued than they are today.Each worker petition must be judged on its own merits and in the time periodin which it was filed. The Amarillo workers were included by an amendmentto a certification for workers of Santa Fe's Midland facility (TA-W-17,731)because a substantial portion of Amarillo's decreased activities in 1985and 1986 resulted from decreased production and sales and employment atMidland which produced crude oil and natural gas. These conditions no longerexist.The Department's denial on the instant petition was based on the fact thatcustomers of Santa Fe Energy did not import crude oil or natural gas. Thefindings also showed that corporate revenues increased during the firstfive months of 1989 compared to the first five months of 1988.The investigation findings showed that no articles within the meaning ofSection 222(3) of the Trade Act, were produced at the Amarillo facility.The Department has consistently determined that the performance of servicesdoes not constitute an article, as required by Section 222 of the Act andthis determination has been upheld in the U.S. Court of Appeals.In order for service workers like those at Amarillo to become certifiedeligible for adjustment assistance their separations must be caused importantlyby a reduced demand for their services from a parent firm, a firm otherwiserelated to the subject firm by ownership, or a firm related by control.In any case, the reduction in demand for services must originate at a productionfacility whose workers independently meet the statutory criteria for certificationand the reduction must directly relate to the product impacted by imports.These conditions have not been met for workers at Amarillo. Workers atSanta Fe's production facilities serviced by Amarillo are not currentlycertified eligible to apply for adjustment assistance.The service provisions of OTCA apply only to workers of service firms whoare engaged in the exploration or drilling for crude oil or natural gasfor unaffiliated clients in the oil and gas industry. These provisionsdo not apply to workers of Santa Fe Energy because Santa Fe is a producerof oil and not a service firm and the services performed at Amarillo arenot those which would form a basis for certification under OTCA.<ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusion</ITAG>After reconsideration, I affirm the original notice of negative determinationof eligibility to apply for adjustment assistance to former workers ofSanta Fe Energy Company, Amarillo, Texas.<ITAG tagnum="21">Signed at Washington, DC, this 30th day of October 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Stephen A.
