Representative small cable skidders,mobile wood chippers, feller-bunchers, grapple skidders and semi-trailerchip vans were evaluated for production capacity, utilization, and unitcost of production when operating at the desired harvesting system capacities.Optimum systems were then designed for nominal production rates of 25,50, and 100 tonne/day using this equipment. A discounted cash flow analysiswas performed in each case to assess economic viability. For currentmarket price range for fuel chips ($14-$16/green tonne), the resultsindicate clearly that none of the determined small scale systems is economicallyviable as an independent business. At current prices for whole-tree chipsfor fiber ($25-$27/green tonne), two systems were determined to satisfythe economic viability criteria. The first, based on felling with chainsaw,cable skidding, and production at 120 tonne/day, was determined to bepreferable to the second best alternative, a feller-buncher/grapple skiddingtype system which would also produce at 120 tonne/day. A nominal 50 tonne/daycable skidding based system configuration was also determined to be promisingif operated in favourable circumstances.
