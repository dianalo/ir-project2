It's not just the short-term gyrations that are unsettling. Over the past two years, the dollar has declined from record highs against the West German mark and the Japanese yen to record lows. Just before that -- from 1980 through early 1985 -- it rose in an unprecedented surge. &quot;The past decade has been characterized by wide swings in the foreign-exchange value of the dollar,&quot; the annual report of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, published last week, observes.    When the dollar was strong, Americans felt wealthy. Imports were cheap and so was foreign travel, but businessmen complained they couldn't compete with low-priced foreign goods. Now with the yen and mark strong, Japanese and West German industrialists are beginning to worry about losing export markets. West German export orders already are beginning to taper off.    The unpredictability and abruptness with which these broad swings in currency values disrupt trade patterns, redistribute wealth and alter returns on investment has made some yearn for a system of fixed exchange rates, which the world abandoned in 1973. The most radical shift would be a return to the gold standard, but some analysts argue there also could be a measure of stability in a system of &quot;target zones,&quot; in which governments would try to keep their currencies within specified bands. The aim: to retain some flexibility of floating rates and yet restore some of the certainty of a fixed-rate regime.    The thought of damping exchange-rate volatility by overhauling the system is understandably tempting. French President Francois Mitterrand has pursued the idea for years. So has Columbia University's Robert Mundell, who wants to relink the dollar to the price of gold. Even Treasury Secretary James Baker and Deputy Secretary Richard Darman have flirted with the target-zones concept. The bilateral currency accord that Mr. Baker signed last October with Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa hints at that approach. Some suggest the big powers should broaden that accord to include the d-mark as well. The idea would be to establish target zones first, in hope that they would force governments to change their policies in order to defend the new currency limits.    The floating-rate system has some serious flaws. The absence of any bench marks for the major currencies has removed the pressure on governments to correct their economic policies when their exchange rates fall out of line. It has invited speculation, which itself has proved destabilizing. And it has placed new burdens on monetary policy. &quot;The present system has no order,&quot; complains Irving Friedman, a former International Monetary Fund strategist. &quot;It's not helping to foster prosperity.&quot;    But some economists question whether fixed rates would work any better in today's chaotic world. As Citibank's former chief economist, Leif Olsen, has pointed out, the final years of the Bretton Woods system were hardly serene, buffeted by frequent international financial &quot;crises&quot; as governments sought vainly to defend unrealistic exchange rates. The fixed-rate system simply couldn't withstand the battering from accelerating inflation, sharply increased international capital flows and the refusal of governments to realign rates or change policies. Just before the switch to floating rates, West Germany lost $10 billion in a futile attempt to maintain the parity between the dollar and the mark.    Moreover, most economists agree there's no serious hope of creating a more stable exchange-rate system until the U.S. and its major economic allies take steps to reduce the huge trade imbalances threatening to destabilize the world economy. As the currency markets have shown this past month, a $170 billion U.S. trade deficit alongside huge West German and Japanese surpluses is simply unsustainable -- and so is any fixed-rate system so long as such imbalances persist.    &quot;There's no way on earth you can keep the exchange rate for the d-mark and the yen at anywhere near the current levels without policy changes in those countries,&quot; says Edward Bernstein, a Brookings Institution economist who was in the U.S. delegation at the 1944 Bretton Woods conference that created the old fixed-rate system. Many analysts add another prerequisite: The U.S. must reduce its budget deficit.    Alan Stoga, an economist with Henry Kissinger Associates, says that reality was demonstrated anew by the accord the U.S. and Japan announced last October. Washington and Tokyo agreed to maintain exchange-rate boundaries, but neither country moved to support those rates, either by intervening in the exchange markets or by changing its policies significantly. As a result, the dollar slid through the limit.    &quot;If governments are not prepared to change economic policy when the exchange rate approaches those limits, then a targetzone system is nonsense,&quot; Mr. Stoga contends. Any move to expand the accord to include the mark as well &quot;would contain the seeds of self-destruction,&quot; unless West Germany cooperated along with the others, he asserts.    Overhauling the international monetary system may be a valid goal in the face of today's volatility. But until Americans and their allies are willing to accept the needed discipline at home, it may be elusive. </TEXT></DOC>
