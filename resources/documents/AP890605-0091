Iraq, Iran's archenemy, had its first official reaction sinceIran's revolutionary patriarch died on Saturday.   Referring to the cease-fire that began last Aug. 20 after eightyears of war, and to stalled peace talks since then, thestate-owned daily Al-Thawra said, ``Iraq is looking only for acomprehensive peace with Iran based on strong relations.''   Al-Thawra said Khomeini was a ``grudge-bearing tyrant'' andcommented that Iran now is ``disunited and confused.''   Other nations that have clashed with Iran also made warysoundings for better relations.   In London, Foreign Office Minister Lord Glenarthur said Britainis ready to resume normal relations with Iran if the Tehrangovernment renounces terrorism and violence.   President Bush said the United States will review rupturedrelations with Iran ``as soon as we see some move away fromoppresssion and extremism.'' But he said he would not makeovertures to the new government in Iran as he was ``not sure yet''about the meaning of changes there following Khomeini's death.   Bush told a news conference Monday, ``There is a way for therelationship to improve and that's the release of the Americanhostages.''   Nine Americans are among 18 foreign hostages held in Lebanon bypro-Iranian Shiite Moslem groups.   In Beirut, Lebanon an estimated 75,000 Shiite Moslem mournersstaged a farewell parade for Khomeini and chanted ``Death toAmerica, death to the great Satan.''   The Kuwait Times echoed a hope expressed by many of Iran's Arabneighbors, that Iran's new leadership ends the deadlock innegotiations for a peace ``that will guarantee permanent stabilityin the region.''   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi eulogized Khomeini as a greatprophet of Islam and revolution and a staunch foe of imperialismand Israel.   But Gadhafi, writing in a condolence book at the Iranian Embassyin his capital of Tripoli, said the Iran-Iraq war ``made a blackrecord in the contemporary history of Islam,'' the Libyan newsagency reported.   The government of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India declaredthree days of state mourning for Khomeini, canceling officialentertainment and ordering flags flown at half-staff.   Gandhi messaged Iranian President Ali Khamenei, ``May theIranian people and the bereaved family have courage and fortitudeto bear this irreparable loss.''   Pope John Paul II, on a visit to Helsinki, Finland, sent apolite message of condolence and said: ``It is necessary to statewith great respect and with deep reflection his impact on hiscountry and a considerable part of the world.'' He did notelaborate.   Hundreds of citizens in predominantly Moslem Turkey phonednewspapers to complain about their government's decision to flyflags at half-staff Tuesday for Khomeini's funeral.   They expressed rage that the flag would be lowered over the tombof Kemal Ataturk, founder of the Turkish republic, whosewesternizing reforms turned Turkey into a secular state and who wasfrequently attacked by Khomeini.   Governments of most conservative Persian Gulf Arab states sentpolite cables of condolences to Tehran, but refrained from publiccomment on the demise of the man many held responsible for a decadeof instability in the region.   Oman was the only country among the six-nation Gulf CooperationCouncil alliance to announce it was sending an official delegationto attend the funeral on Tuesday and to convey the condolences ofSultan Qaboos.   The council groups Oman, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrainand the United Arab Emirates, the six countries who were in thedirect firing line of Khomeini's pledge to export his brand offundamentalist Islam.   The leadership in Saudi Arabia had yet to send even a cable ofcondolences to Tehran. Saudi Arabia bore a particular grudgeagainst Khomeini for the repeated attempts to politicize the annualMoslem pilgrimage to Mecca with Khomeini's teachings.</TEXT></DOC>
