The defense and electronics concern earned $87 million, or $1.32 a share, a year earlier. Sales in the latest quarter totaled $2.56 billion, compared with $2.24 billion.    Lawrence O. Kitchen, chairman, said profit margins were slightly lower in the latest quarter because the costs associated with the August 1986 acquisition of Sanders Associates were amortized, and because of higher development cost-sharing requirements on certain aircraft programs. He said that although pre-tax profits from various programs rose to $171 million from $163 million, higher interest expenses primarily caused the first-quarter earnings decline. </TEXT></DOC>
