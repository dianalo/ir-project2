Two separate demonstrations, held hours before the start of amatch in Cape Town, were part of a nationwide anti-apartheidcampaign launched Aug. 2 to protest segregation and the Sept. 6parliamentary elections, which exclude the black majority.   Twenty-eight demonstrators were arrested at a hotel after meetingbriefly with Willie John McBride, manager of the international squadmade up of Australian, French and British players.   Two activists also were arrested when about 30 protestersgathered outside the main branch of the First National Bank, whichis sponsoring the rugby tour.   They were identified as Dawood Khan, a spokesman for the WesternCape Traders Association, and Willie Hofmeyer, a leader of thebanned United Democratic Front, the country's largest anti-apartheidcoalition.   Police on Friday banned all rallies in protest of the tour. Theinternational team's visit has been denounced by activists as abreach of a sports boycott imposed to protest apartheid.   On Friday, riot police armed with tear gas and shotguns clashedwith anti-apartheid protesters in townships near Cape Town. Policewounded three youths and rioters reportedly killed two black men.   The country's two largest anti-apartheid labor federations metoutside Johannesburg today and were expected to discuss possibleprotest action against the Sept. 6 parliamentary elections.   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregatedsociety in which the 28 million blacks have no vote in nationalaffairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintainseparate districts, schools and health services.   Police Commissioner Gen. Hennie de Witt on Friday imposedrestrictions on the two-day meeting of the anti-apartheid laborgroups, allowing only union members to attend, prohibiting politicalbanners and limiting discussions to labor issues.   Dozens of police were present when labor officials began arrivingthis morning. The two organizations are the Congress of SouthAfrican Trade Unions, which has more than 900,000 members, and thesmaller National Council of Trade Unions.   As part of a defiance campaign led in part by the trade uniongroup, dozens of blacks successfully sought treatment Friday at awhites-only hospital wing in East London and clergymen announcedplans to defy bus segregation laws in the capital city, Pretoria.   Similar protests took place at six whites-only hospitals on Aug.2.   On Friday, police fired birdshot to break up a protest atMitchell's Plain township, wounding three mixed-race high schoolstudents. Another police contingent set up roadblocks outside theUniversity of the Western Cape and fired tear gas at mixed-race andblack students who had erected barricades on the campus.   Police officials said two officers were wounded by a gunman inMitchell's Plain, and reported that two black men were killed byrioters in separate incidents elsewhere after their vehicles wereattacked, one by people hurling stones and one by a firebomb.   In Pretoria, a group of black and white clergymen announced thata campaign to desegregate the city's transit system will beginMonday. The ministers said blacks would board whites-only buses andwhites would ride in mini-bus taxis, which are supposed to carryonly blacks.   They said the weeklong campaign would be peaceful and invitedPretoria-based foreign diplomats to observe.</TEXT></DOC>
