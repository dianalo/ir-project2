MalloyStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 05/26/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> FREST </IN><DATELINE> MANILA, the Philippines  </DATELINE><TEXT>    Three times a day, BoyingMaceda makes the rounds of the crowded little suburb where helives. &quot;Rain or shine, no holidays,&quot; he says, stepping acrossopen drains and past the goats that feed in vacant lots. Whena nearby lake spread hip-deep into the neighborhood lastNovember, Mr. Maceda covered his beat in a canoe.   Mr. Maceda is a &quot;collector&quot; for an illegal numbers racket called jueteng. It is the lowest form of graft in a country where corruption still flourishes, 15 months after Filipinos ousted Ferdinand Marcos and set out to reform the government.    Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin, who oversees the Bureau of Customs, says customs officials still connive at widespread smuggling. The head of the Philippine Constabulary, which controls the police, recently complained that many of the new government's local officials are involved in illegal gambling.    The police aren't prize-winners either. A Manila resident whose wife was stabbed to death early this month says detectives took statements, dusted for fingerprints and asked for a $100 payoff to pursue the investigation -- more than most Filipinos earn in a month.    The government of President Corazon Aquino has halted the big-time graft, the &quot;crony capitalism&quot; that distinguished the Marcos regime. She doesn't give government monopolies to favored businessmen or underwrite multimillion-dollar projects to enrich friends.    But Mrs. Aquino has done little to halt the pervasive grass-roots corruption that is far more visible to ordinary citizens. &quot;Petty graft and corruption really affects the common man more because it affects his daily life,&quot; says Vicente Paterno, who recently ran for the Senate on Mrs. Aquino's ticket.    Failure to deal with the problem could affect stability. &quot;Corrupt judges and the corrupt police, that's why you join the NPA. It's because someone in your family got a raw deal,&quot; says a diplomat who studies the communist guerrillas called the New People's Army.    Jueteng seems a relatively harmless game, and Mr. Maceda seems a harmless family man. He has his wife's name tattooed on his shoulder and relishes his job security. &quot;In this business the capitalist won't go bankrupt,&quot; he says, smiling through a Pancho Villa mustache.    But the numbers racket involves enormous sums of money by Philippine standards. One published report puts monthly wagers at $44 million. &quot;This is the one source that corrupts the law enforcers,&quot; says Ruther Batuigas, the country's bestknown crime reporter. &quot;They get spoiled, they get involved in bigger corruption.&quot;    Says Neptali Gonzales, a leading member of the newly elected Philippine Senate, &quot;It is a matter of common knowledge that jueteng can't be played in any town without a tie-up with elements of the military and the local police.&quot;    &quot;We are never bothered, we have protection,&quot; explains Mr. Maceda's kabo. A kabo is the next step up in the jueteng industry, supervising about a dozen collectors like Mr. Maceda. He reports to the &quot;second owner,&quot; who in turn fronts for the &quot;financer&quot; or &quot;capitalist&quot; who actually owns the local jueteng operation.    Protection allows the jueteng game to operate with remarkable openness. If a really big bet is laid in his area, the kabo says the second owner will come there to draw the winning number before a crowd of neighbors. The neighborhood record for a jueteng win is $800, by a local policeman. To publicize the event, the syndicate also gave the policeman a television set &quot;as a promotion,&quot; the kabo says.    Mr. Ongpin, the finance secretary, says Mrs. Aquino is &quot;very serious&quot; about reducing corruption and requires a progress report on the subject each month from her cabinet members. But in practice, the government has done little besides seize property from Mr. Marcos's former cronies. Nobody of note has gone to jail.    &quot;They keep defining corruption and studying corruption but they haven't made a stab at it. . . . There hasn't been any effort to bring people to justice,&quot; a Western diplomat says. And Mr. Ongpin concedes that &quot;nobody is going to believe us until we nail one of the big fish and put him in jail.&quot;    Mr. Ongpin was plunged into almost a year of frustration and lawsuits when he tried to clean up the customs service, where he says corruption loses &quot;billions&quot; of pesos in government revenue (the peso currently trades at 20.48 to the dollar). Most of the drain comes through falsifying documents to make imports appear less valuable, thus reducing the import duty.    To beat this problem, Mr. Ongpin early last year hired Societe Generale de Surveillance, a Swiss cargo surveyor, to inspect Philippine-bound goods before they left nine foreign ports. &quot;In the one month we had SGS working, they found 79% of documents were under-declared, misclassified&quot; or otherwise faulty, he says.    But the customs commissioner got a court order to stop the inspections. It was seven months before Mr. Ongpin could begin a new contract with SGS, covering only three foreign ports.    There seem to be three main reasons for the Aquino government's feeble approach to corruption:    --Mrs. Aquino is indecisive. She lets her appointees make policy, then fails to intervene when they disagree. The standoff over SGS is an example. &quot;Her political instincts are unbeatable, but she isn't a manager,&quot; says one of her advisers.    --She is reluctant to offend the armed forces, which control the police. &quot;In the fight against corruption, against lawlessness, the government can't rely on the military to enforce law and order because the military is itself very tainted and has so many skeletons in its closet,&quot; a diplomat says.    --Corruption is so ingrained, so necessary to feed the family of a $75-a-month policeman, that many Filipinos don't see it as a punishable offense. &quot;We don't want to break somebody's rice bowl and put the breadwinner in jail; it isn't Christian,&quot; says Mr. Paterno, the Senate candidate.    Mrs. Aquino's failure to use her powers against conventional corruption, or to jail even Marcos-era thieves, sets a poor example for the new Philippine Congress. Mr. Marcos didn't invent crony capitalism, he centralized a system of handouts and favors that flourished under previous congresses. There will be temptation for the new congressmen, eager to oil their political machines, to revive the practice.    &quot;What might happen is they substitute new cronies for old ones,&quot; says Jesus Estanislao, chairman of the state-owned Development Bank of the Philippines. The test will come when the government disposes of billions of dollars in assets seized from the old cronies or held by government corporations.    &quot;I think I can insulate myself from the pressure and so can my colleagues,&quot; says senator-elect Rene Saguisag. But he says there may be &quot;a hell of fight as to who gets what bone.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
