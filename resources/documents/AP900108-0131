FAA Administator James Busey said the agency's eventual action,which could be two years away, may mean that adults traveling withchildren under age 2 will have to buy tickets for the youngstersand, perhaps, have them secured in FAA-approved child seats.   Current FAA quidelines allow a child under age 2 to ride forfree on an adult's lap.   Busey, asked if the revised requirements would disallow thatpractice, replied, ``We want to know what the public wants. ...That's part of the problem .''   He also told reporters at a transportation convention, ``I can'tmake a rule that requires the airlines to provide free seats.''   If Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole approves the FAAproposal to write rules for the airlines' youngest passengers, aformal notice will be printed in the Federal Register.   The public will then have 90 days to comment. An FAA spokesmansaid hearings may be held.   A representative of the Association of Flight Attendants, whichstrongly supports putting children under age 2 in some sort ofrestraints, commented after Busey's announcement that ``it'sludicrous that there are FAA regulations in place to restraincarry-on baggage while babies are allowed to fly around the cabinduring a crash.''   Nancy Gilmer, air safety coordinator for the association,praised the FAA for moving quickly on efforts to improve safety forsmall children and said many parents don't understand the problemof unrestrained youngsters.   ``It's not unusual to be getting ready to take off and somelittle kid is running down the aisle,'' she said. ``As a flightattendant, it's something you learn to deal with.''   A spokeswoman for USAir said the airline is neutral on thesubject of toughened safety requirements for small children.   Spokeswoman Susan Young said a majority of parents travelingwith children under age 2 carry them on the adults' laps, althoughsome parents bring their own carriers and buy tickets for theirchildren.   Interest in airliner child restraints rose after the July 19crash of United Airlines Flight 232 at Sioux City, Iowa.   Five children under age 2 were traveling on adults' laps; onewas a 23-month-old boy who died after his mother lost her grip asthe plane cartwheeled across a runway, split apart and burst intoflames. The child died of smoke inhalation.   Busey also said told reporters that within 18 months the publiccan expect to see airport security devices that will detect plasticexplosives.   The technology to detect such explosives exists and is in usefor baggage checked into airliner cargo space at John F. KennedyInternational Airport in New York and will soon be installed inMiami.   He said that the equipment is still too cumbersome to be usedfor carry-on luggage but that the devices are becoming smaller andsoon will be standard equipment in all airports.</TEXT></DOC>
