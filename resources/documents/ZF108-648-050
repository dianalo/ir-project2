(now merged into Dun andamp; Bradstreet Software), whichagreed to develop products for IBM's OfficeVision integrated officeautomation suite of products.andP;  By the end of 1989, IBM had made equityinvestments in MSA and 74 other industry partners.andM;IBMs efforts to expand into new businesses produced mixed results in 1989.andO;On the positive side, the company did manage to drum up some major newbusiness from customers such as Eastman Kodak Co., which decided to turn muchof its data center operations management and applications development over toBig Blue.andP;  On the negative side, IBM officials acknowledge that revenuegrowth from the company's software business has been slower than expecteddespite the solutions push.andP;  And profit margins on both software and serviceshave been slipping,andM;Software revenues at IBm were up only 6.3% in 1989, reflecting a continuinguser trend toward data center consolidation.andP;  IBM last year saw its fastestrevenue growth in personal systems and 3090 mainframe systems, although itsoverall processor business climbed only 7% for the year.andP;  Personal systemsrevenues streaked up by 19%, and the 3090 enjoyed double-digit sales growthand improved margins.andP;  IBM's revenues from peripherals and maintenance weredown by 2.3% and 3.8%, respectively, in 1989.andM;New products such as the 3390 large disk drives and RISC System/6000workstations figure to improve IBM's revenues in peripherals and workstationsin 1990.andP;  The company's new cost structure (fewer employees) figures to raiseprofits, and its new business relationships should ensure softwaredevelopment for IBM systems.andP;  But IBM's ability-versus that of itscompetitors-to respond to user needs in the 1990s will be what reallydetermines the company s financial figures in the future.andM;IS Revenues: $12.94 BillionandM;REGION                           WORLDandM;2           DIGITAL               2andM;Revenues By RegionandM;N.

Well, hazy.andP;  Digital's quarterlyearnings slumped 44% as it ended calendar 1989, and its chief, Kenneth Olsen,hinted that his company might actually lose money in the first three monthsof 1990.andP;  It came close, earning only $25 million on revenues of $3.3billion.andP;  Digital's bottom line was reduced by a one-time restructuringcharge of  150 million chiefly to cover workers' severance packages.andP;  Someanalysts expect employee head count reductions on the order of 6,000 workersthis year.andM;Digital's bread-and-butter business, minicomputers, is under competitive firefrom workstations, high-performance PCs and versatile local area networks.andO;And its single biggest market, the United States, remains somewhat sluggish.andM;Olsen appears anything but glum, however.andP;  The ideal response to an industryslowdown, says Digital's founder and president, is new products and newdirections.andP;  And Digital has indeed responded.andP;  Branching out beyond thedepartmental, engineering and factory-floor applications that form itstraditional base, Digital introduced so many products and services in 1989that a list of them consumes 22 pages.andP;  And it is keeping up the pace in 199andM;The vAx 9000, Digital's entry into the mainframe market, leads the list ofnew high-performance products.andP;  Orders for the systems, which won't beginshipping in volume until the second half of this calendar year, exceedeveryone's expectations.andP;  The vAx 9000's penetration outside Digital'straditional customer base, expected to be nonexistent, is provingsignificant.andP;  In a recent survey of DATAMATION subscribers, a full 45% ofrespondents who intend to buy a VAX 9000 this year or next say they arereplacing existing  IBM systems with the new DEC mainframe.andM;Securities analysts who follow the company are in search of another list,however.andP;  They want to know what steps Digital is going to take to reduce itscosts.andP;  They believe Digital, with total employment of 125,906, is bloatedand must inevitably go through the sort of painful reorganization thatcompanies such as Data General and Wang have undergone, reducing theiremployee ranks by 10 to 25% in 1989.andM;&quot;We're not doing too bad&quot; is about as much as Olsen will say on the subjectof his company's financial condition.andP;  Digital is sitting on nearly $2billion in cash and liquid assets.andP;  It's putting more than 10% of revenuesinto research and engineering.andP;  And it's introducing new products practicallyevery week.andP;  &quot;Others may be hurting,&quot; Olsen says.andP;  &quot;We're still generatingrevenue like crazy.&quot;andM;The question facing Digital is whether it can generate greater and greateramounts of revenue like crazy.andP;  Quarterly sates at the company hit their peaka year ago at $3.5 billion.andP;  Some analysts, however, expect the company tofinish its fourth quarter with a bang-achieving $3.6 billion in revenues.andM;IS Revenues: $9.40 BillionandM;REGION                          WORLDandM;3           UNISYS               5andM;Revenues By RegionandM;N.

Unruh.andP;  &quot;And we realized as we got into the year that we were goingto have to make much more substantial changes in our cost structure.&quot;andM;The company was also ill-prepared for sweeping  changes in the government anddefense sector of its business, particularly changes that Unruh calls &quot;movingcost and risk to its contractors.andP;  &quot; Last year'  the government began toshift research and development projects from cost-plus contracts to a fixedprice basis.andP;  But Unisys was one of several companies that had largewrite-offs because of overruns on fixed price contracts.andP;  &quot;Now, because ofpeace breaking out, budgets are under pressure and so are new programs,&quot; saysUnruh, painting a bleak scenario.andM;By taking drastic measures in 1989, Unruh believes his company can competeeffectively in selected  J.S.andP;  market sectors such as financial services andretail, when they pick up.andP;  Although the company didn't make any money on itsburgeoning open systems business or on PCs last year, Unruh says he hopes toin 1990.andP;  He also expects moderate single-digit growth for mainframes and forhis whole business in 1990.andM;IS Revenues: $7.80 BillionandM;REGION       HEWLETT-             WORLDandM;4           PACKARD                 7andM;Revenues By RegionandM;N.

Thecompany is enjoying faster growth than most direct computer competitors, andit's encountering a new set of economics.andM;The benefits and the costs of changing from a U.S.andP;  supplier of proprietaryminicomputer hosts to a global provider of standards-based desktop systemsand peripherals are clearly evident in HP's 1989 financial performance.andP;  Thecompany's information systems sales, DATAMATION estimates, grew 24% to $7.8billion for calendar 1989, representing 65% of its $11.9 billion in corporaterevenues.andP;  But earnings for the company failed to keep pace-climbing only 9%to $829 million.andM;The reason is fairly clear: there's less room for profit on sales of personalcomputers, workstations and peripherals--the source of more than 50% of HP'scomputer revenues-than on sales of mini-computers.andP;  HP's $500 millionacquisition of workstation-maker Apollo Computer Inc. also hurt its 1988bottom line.andM;HP will be going head-to-head with IBM in the 1990s.andP;  The two companiessquare off in personal computers  HP's Vectra line vs.andP;  IBM's PS/2 family);desktop laser printers (HP's Laserjet III vs.andP;  IBM's 4019 LaserPrinter);midrange/server systems (HP's 3000 line vs.andP;  IBM's AS/400 family); andworkstations/servers (HP's 9000 and Apollo systems vs.andP;  IBM's RS/6000series).andM;Many other companies are offering products based on operating systems likeMS-DOS, os/2 and UNIX.andP;  What makes HP any different? &quot;Standards don't meanstandardization,  says Dean Morton, HP's chief operating officer.andP;  HP addsvalue atop standards, he says, pointing to the company's object-orientedNew-Wave software.andM;The biggest indication of just how seriously HP takes distributed computingcame earlier this year.andP;  In january, the company blitzed the industry with a24-product rollout designed to reposition its minicomputers from hosts toservers.andP;  The company's RISC series-the Hp 3000 family, running HP'sproprietary MPE operating system, and the HP 9000, running the company'sversion of UNIX-now have nearly a dozen server models between them.andM;Adding customers-in key industry segments as well as geographically-may provea daunting challenge.andP;  Manufacturing users currently account for more than50% of HP's computer sales, and the company is looking to expand into othermarkets, such as financial services.andM;HP will face stiffer competition from the likes of NEC Corp. and Siemens AGas it strives to broaden its international sales beyond their currentlevel-some 52% of HP's business overall.andP;  But demand for information systemsis growing so fast in Europe and the Far East-30 to 40% a rear b Morton'sestimates-that HP has little choice but to attack globally.andM;As HP attacks new geographic, industrial and technological markets, it mustdiscipline itself financially.andP;  Many of these new markets are best servedthrough distribution channels other than direct sales-meaning that HP mustaccept narrower profit margins.andP;  Many require fast time to market andtechnologically sophisticated products-meaning that HP must continue toallocate nearly 11% of its revenues to research and development.andP;  Given thesedynamics, it's likely that HP Will continue to consolidate manufacturingactivities and cap employee ranks at 95,000.andM;IS Revenues: $5.37 BillionandM;REGION                          WORLDandM;5            APPLE              11andM;Revenues By RegionandM;N.andP;  AMER.andP;                    64%andM;EUROPE         23%andM;ASIA        12%andM;OTHER 11%andM;APPLE COMPUTER INC.andM;20525 Mariani AvenueandM;Cupertino, CA 95014andM;(408)-996-1010andM;By most yardsticks, Apple Computer Inc. performed exceedingly well during1989.andP;  Despite an overall slowdown in the personal computer industry, Applereported a 21% increase in net sales for its fiscal year and unveiled severalnew Macintosh models with impressive communications capabilities.andP;  Thecompany also nurtured a strong financial position, represented by reserves of$809 million, a return on equity of 36% and no debt.andM;But the good news on revenues was offset by a  disappointing 4.5% growth inearnings for calendar 1989, compared with a 60% leap in calendar 1988.andP;  InDecember, Apple's stock dipped following pessimistic earnings projectionsfrom several investment houses and reports that Apple's 9% penetration of thebusiness market had stalled.andM;The resignation of Apple USA president Allan Z.

Zanderoffers three reasons.andP;  One, Sun has scale.andP;  It's a $2 billion company with12,000 employees, dwarfing the size of Digital's or HP's workstationoperations.andP;  Two, Sun has software.andP;  More than 2,000 applications have beenwritten for the SPARC platform, alone.andP;  Three, Sun singularly focuses ondistributed, client-server computing.andM;Sun also has some limitations.andP;  Despite its effort to better manage costs,the company is still using more cash than it generates.andP;  The company had tosecure at least $240 million in new debt financing to see it through fiscal1990.andP;  Despite its effort to expand beyond technical computer sales, Sunstill derives most of its revenues from software-engineering and designautomation applications.andP;  Despite its orientation toward standards-basedcomputing, Sun still must spend heavily on research and development-13% ofrevenues a year-to keep ahead of the competition.andM;IS Revenues: $1.89 BillionandM;REGION                          WORLDandM;14           TANDY               31andM;Revenues By RegionandM;N.andP;

 Corporate revenues for the diversified electronicscompany last year grew only 7% to $4.3 billion', with nearly 45% of Tandy'ssales coming from desktop systems and peripherals.andP;  The company's earningsdeclined to $304 million in 1989, a 6% drop from the $323 million net incomein 1988.andP;  The performance reflects, in part, declining profit margins in thepersonal computer business.andP;  The settlement of a patent dispute and cutthroatcompetition in consumer electronics, Tandy's main business, also hurt thebottom line.andM;However, this year's profits may benefit from marketing and technologyinitiatives that Tandy has taken in the past two years to reposition itselfin the Pc business.andP;  In 1988, the company purchased Fremont, Calif.-basedGrid Systems Corp., a laptop and portable PC manufacturer that now is makingimpressive large-account sales.andP;  One sale in 1989 was a 400-unit order tosupply laptop systems to American Airlines Inc.andM;An alliance with Digital Equipment Corp. to resell Tandy PCs under theDigital name provides Tandy with an additional channel for reaching Fortune1,000 customers.andP;  And Tandy's DeskMate, a Windows-like graphical userinterface for entry-level Pcs, received the endorsement of Lotus DevelopmentCorp., which ported its popular 1-2-3 spreadsheet program to run onDesk-Mate-equipped systems.andM;Tandy's purchase of Grid Systems, and the subsequent reshuffling ofresponsibility of large corporate accounts to Grid, will have the most impacton the Fortune 1,000 market.andP;  The Tandy-Grid merger has produced a dependablesupplier of high-quality computers in the eyes of james Montequnin, managerof communications for Union Pacific Railroad in Omaha.andP;  Originally chosen asa second source for PCs  after IBM), Tandy-via Grid-has emerged as UnionPacific's chief laptop supplier.andP;  &quot;I probably wouldn't have looked at Gridfor my laptops without them being associated with Tandy.andP;  But with Tandybehind them, you know they're going to be around, and you know they'll beoffering pricecompetitive  products,&quot;  Montequnin says.andM;One reason Tandy can compete on price is its manufacturing prowess.andP;  Thecompany is regarded as having perhaps the lowest production costs of any U.S.andO;PC manufacturer.andP;  Tandy's $11 million Fort Worth plant, which opened in Aprilof 1989, is capable of producing 5,000 computers a day and has labor costsamounting to less than 2% of the cost of each computer.andM;However, Tandy needs to improve in the marketing area.andP;  After years oftrying, Tandy still has not really cracked the Fortune 1,000 market.andP;  Thecompany's share of such business is so low that it gets lumped with &quot;other&quot;in market analyses.andP;  Large accounts offer significant growth opportunity forTandy, which must tap into that potential to remain competitive with AppleComputer Inc., Compaq Computer Corp. and other Pc makers effectively servingthe biggest U.S.andP;  companies.andP;  To Tandy's credit, it can compete for largeaccounts when it chooses to-as it did in winning part of a 50,000-unit Pcorder from American Airlines (separate from the Grid contract).andM;Sales of systems at the low end of the U.S.andP;  Pc market, which Tandy reachesvia its Radio Shack outlets, have slowed, leading the company to.andP;  place moreemphasis on high-end products and foreign sales.andP;  Tandy last year acquiredVictor Electronics-a Swedish supplier of desk-top, laptop handheld computersto European business users.andP;  Victor complements the company's consumer PCmarketing efforts in Europe, where  Tandy sells systems through theelectronics stores of Fort Worth-based InterTAN Inc.andM;Looking toward japan, Tandy continues to maintain close ties to MatsushitaElectric Industrial Co.

(sold in 1988) and CDC's storageproducts business (spun off as Imprimis Technology Inc. and sold last year toSeagate Technology for $450 million), Perlman takes the reins from RobertPrice, who remains chairman.andP;  Perlman's stellar track record and hiswillingness to frankly address CDC's problems are the main reasons manyanalysts have put their CDC obituaries on hold.andM;Last year saw CDC undergo a reduction of almost unimaginable proportion.andO;Besides jettisoning ETA and Imprimis, CDC sold off its Ticketron ticketingservice, its credit-reporting services, its third-party maintenance businessin Europe and the United States and also discontinued its VTC semiconductoroperations.andP;  What's left-a handful of data services and the computer systemsbusiness-are expected to generate some $2 billion in revenue this year, downfrom $3.7 billion in total company revenues in 1985.andP;  And for the first  timein years the company is awash in cash.andM;Sales in 1990 while waiting for its new strategy in computers to kick in.andO;CDC's strategy is to resell high-performance systems bought from others andenhanced with CDC systems know-how.andP;  It has inked deals with Convex ComputerCorp., Cray Research Inc., MIPS Computer Systems Inc. and Silicon GraphicsComputer Systems Inc.andM;In January 1990, the company announced the first products based on its MIPSalliance: the 4000 series of UNIX departmental computers based on reducedinstruction set computing (RISC).andP;  The 4000 is a whole new price/performancecategory for CDC; at 55 million instruction? per second, it's faster than thescalar versions of IBM's 3090-180J and faster even than CDC's own Cyber 2000,the new high end to the Cyber line, which CDC will begin shipping toward  theend of this year.andP;  CDC equipped the 4000 with mainframe-like input/output(I/O) capability and is planning 10-megabyte-per second linkups to existingCyber systems.andM;By marrying the I/O and data storage capabilities o the mainframe with theprice/performance power of RISC, CDC Popes to regain the ground it's beenlosing to Apollo Computer Inc., Digital Equipment Corp. and Sun MicrosystemsInc.-and do it a lot less expensively than it could by building systems fromscratch.andP;  The 4000 also signals the beginning of the end for the Cyber NOS/VEarchitecture.andP;  Company officials don't like to be pinned down, but by thelate 1990s, they say, the Cyber will be history.andM;Ousley is convinced that just by recapturing business it has been losingwithin its existing customer base, CDC can boost annual computer sales 15% ormore over the next.andP;  two or three years.andP;  After the restructuring isaccounted for, CDC lost $680.4 million on revenues of $2.9 billion in 1989.andM;Ousley expects no revenue growth in computers this year.andP;  The reason: salesof the 4000 will be offset by a drop in Cyber revenues while customers delaypurchases, waiting for the new Cyber 2000.andP;  Meanwhile, CDC is investingheavily in what's left in the data services side of the business, whichincludes Arbitron Co.'s audience measurement products, lottery systems and anarray of business management and information services.andM;Are CDC's loyal and beleaguered customers convinced CDC is on the right trackthis time? &quot;A year ago, everyone was asking if we [were] getting out of thebusiness,&quot;- said Ousley in March.andP;  &quot;Now customers are asking,  What are yougoing to do for me next?'

 The conglomerate last year paid $330 million for ChiltonCorp., the Dallas-based credit reporting agency.andM;Most of the  Chilton organization was folded into TRW Credit DataDivision--one of 10 entities that constitute TRW'S Information Systems andServices (ISS) segment.andP;  The merger gave the segment a 31 % boost in sales to$7 05 million and doubled its profits to $60 million.andP;  The segment nowgenerates nearly 10% of TRW's $7.3 billion in corporate revenues-almostdouble its importance from a year ago.andM;The acquisition also gave the company information power.andP;  it now has adatabase covering virtually 100% of the estimated 160 million U.S.andP;  users ofconsumer credit.andP;  Through other operations within the information systemssegment, TRW also began offering three other Chilton products, EmploymentInsight Report, an automated credit report that can be used for employmentpurposes; Social Search, a social security number search service for locatingconsumers; and Collection Aid, a package of services that can be used asprecollection and collection tools.andM;A star performer in the ISS segment in 1989 was Berkeley, Calif.-based TRWFinancial Systems Inc., which builds image-based information-processingsystems.andP;  It signed multimillion-dollar orders with American Express Co., TheChase Manhattan Bank, MasterCard International Inc., New Jersey Bell andPacific Bell Co. in 1989.andP;  It also signed a cross-licensing agreement withIBM under which TRW will develop distributed image-based applications tocomplement IBM's Image-Plus transaction system.andM;The company adopted a new strategy to rescue another unit of its ISS segment:TRW Customer Service Division, a 20-year-old third-party computer maintenanceoperation that had shrank 11% to $160 million in 1988.andP;  A growth spurt may beahead; the division has started to provide maintenance services not only forselected products but for all computer products of multiple vendors in largeuser organizations.andP;  It also has maintenance agreements with high-volumemicrocomputer manufacturers.andP;

 For the Defense Department and othergovernment agencies, these groups provide software and systems engineering tohelp develop and manage hundreds of command and control centers, as well aslarge database management systems.andM;Although much of TRW's is-related work is defense related, the company inrecent years has been placing heavy emphasis on commercial applications.andP;

 Whitney andamp; Co.andM;In August, J.H.andP;  Whitney acquired 79% of Prime's common stock, about 49.5million shares, at $20 apiece.andP;  The move effectively cut off MAI at the pass.andO;J.H.andP;  Whitney picked up the remaining shares in January to complete itsacquisition.andP;  The change in ownership didn't come without pain.andP;  In August,James F. McDonala, former head of Gould Inc., replaced Anthony L. Craig,Prime's president and chief executive officer since Joe Henson's resignationthe previous October.andP;  McDonald announced a restructuring plan that includedthe layoff of about 2,500 people, or 20% of the work force.andP;  The job cutscame on top of 1,200 layoffs that had been announced in the first part of theyear.andM;Prime had modest performance gains after the acquisition.andP;  Product revenue inthe quarter before the acquisition was $206.7 million and $232.5 million thefollowing quarter.andP;  All revenues for the year were down slightly, from $1.59billion in 1988 to  1.52 billion in 1989.andP;  with two different restructuringplans, three different presidents, (former Digital Equipment Corp'  vicepresident Jack Shieds was brought in to replace McDonald), lawsuits andfinancial maneuvering, it's not surprising that new products took a back seatin 1989.andP;  Still, Prime did offer some enhancements to its engineeringproducts., including new computer-aided design (CAD) software products andnew CAD workstations based on Sun Microsystems Inc.'s SPARC microprocessortechnology.andM;The company's single addition to its flagship line in 1989-a new low-endminicomputer system for the 50 series--appeared to some as a rather weakenhancement, fueling speculation about Prime's future as a minicomputermaker.andP;  To silence such talk, Richard Snyder, vice president of the ComputerSystems Business Unit, met with users in Dallas in November and promised amore vigorous development course, including multiprocessor-based systems thatwill nearly double the 50's maximum performance to 56 million instructionsper second.andP;  This january, part of Snyder's promises were met when a newsingle-processor high-end system was introduced.andM;Despite such continued assurances from the company, concerns about supportfor its traditional minicomputer line date back at least to 1988, when  itacquired Computervision Corp. That purchase made Prime the second biggestcomputer-aided design/manufacturing (CAD/CAM) vendor in the world, behindIBM.andM;Following the Computervision deal, the CAD/CAM business accounted for 19% ofPrime's revenues.andP;  Last year, following a restructuring that broke thecompany into five independent units, Prime's CAD/CAM business grew to 32% oftotal revenues.andP;  In the international arena, where Prime gets 60% of all itsrevenues, CAD/CAM was even more important, accounting for 42% of revenue.andM;The existing base of 50 series customers represents too much potentialrevenue to abandon entirely.andP;  Still, the line on Prime for the last few yearsis that it's using CAD/CAM as a wedge to drive itself into a smaller, butprofitable, niche.andP;  Nothing in last year's turmoil appears to invalidate thatview.andM;IS Revenues: $1.44 BillionandM;REGION                            WORLDandM;21              CSC              41andM;Revenues By RegionandM;N.andP;

 Roughly two-thirds of the company's revenues stem fromgovernment business.andP;  But as U.S.andP;  defense spending slows, so too mustrevenue opportunities for integrators feeding at the federal trough.andO;Foreseeing a slowdown in government integration projects, CSC's chairman andpresident William Hoover reorganized the company in 1989-redirecting itsfocus onto the commercial horizon and shedding nonstrategic assets.andM;CSC's stated goal is to derive 50% of its operating profits from thecommercial sector by 1994.andP;  By then, the company hopes to rank among the toptwo or three systems integrators in the United States and Europe.andP;  ElectronicData Systems Corp., Andersen Consulting and the integrator's arms of majorsystems suppliers such as IBM now best CSC in the United States in thecommercial systems integration market, whereas Cap Gemini Sogeti and othershave the lead in Europe.andM;With the commercial objective in mind, CSC launched a series of aggressivemoves in 1989.andP;  Revamping its internal structure, CSC combined its ComputerPartners Inc., Index Group Inc., Communications Industry Services and CSCEurope operations to form CSC Consulting, which is headed by former Indexchairman Thomas Gerrity.andP;  The expanded group attracted some prime talent fromAndersen during the year.andP;  One of the brightest stars in that talent galaxywas Mel Bergstein, who shot over to the CSC camp last summer after spending21 years at Andersen as the respected leader of its worldwide informationtechnology practice.andM;Bergstein's defection had to be a blow to Andersen, which was also taking itsknocks from CSC in the marketplace.andP;  &quot;We're consistently winning againstAndersen,&quot; Gerrity boasts, attributing these wins to the company'sall-encompassing turnkey approach.andP;  &quot;We're not interested in just producing ablack box.andP;  We're interested in making sure that whatever the box is, it fitswell with the customer's business.&quot;andM;CSC also has decided apparently that the U.S.andP;  subsidiaries of some foreignrivals fit well with its own business.andP;  It announced a marketing alliancewith SAP America Inc., the U.S.andP;  arm of SAP AG in Walldorf, West Germany, anapplication software vendor.andP;  Under the pact, CSC will jointly sell SAP's R/2software, which is aimed at the manufacturing and distribution industries.andO;It also is negotiating to buy Cleveland Consulting Associates Inc., alogistics and operations management consulting firm owned by England'sSaatchi andamp; Saatchi PLC.andM;CSC also has been active on the European front.andP;  In the spring of 1989, itacquired CIG-Intersys Group, the largest computer services company inBelgium.andP;  Five months later, in November, CSC bought British consulting firmInforem Ltd.andM;There's a method to these mergers and moves by CSC, which is clearlysignaling its strong intent to beef up its system integration and ITconsulting efforts in various vertical industry segments.andP;  &quot;We aim to keepbuilding our industry and application strength,&quot; confirms Gerrity, who addsthat this strategy will keep CSC on the takeover trail.andP;  We'll continue tolook for attractive consulting or systems integration acquisitions in theU.S.andP;  and Europe-acquisitions that can provide us with either industry ortechnical expertise or with geographic coverage that complements our own.&quot;andM;One thing that doesn't complement CSC's new business thrust is its Infonetoperation.andP;  Early last year, it reported selling off the final vestiges ofits historic telecommunications service.andP;  Industry watchers opine that withthis symbolic shedding, CSC is preparing to play a much more powerful role onthe worldwide systems integration stage.andM;IS Revenues: $1.30 BillionandM;REGION          DATA              WORLDandM;22           GENERAL                43andM;Revenues By RegionandM;N.

Wang bought Cullinet last September for $300 million,adding the Westwood, Mass., company to his existing stable of databasesoftware thoroughbreds.andP;  He had corralled Applied Data Research (ADR) a yearearlier.andM;Both Cullinet and ADR were victims of IBM's renewed determination to dominatethe database management system (DBMS) business-a key force creatingacquisition opportunities for Computer Associates.andP;  Wang expects many moreindependent software companies from all sectors to join his fold in the yearsahead because of IBM's bundling of software with its proprietary hardware andIBM's investment in selected software companies.andM;The cost of being the chief alternative to IBM for large scale systemsapplication software is mounting.andP;  Spending on research and development atComputer Associates consumed 13% of revenues in 1989.andP;  Product support andenhancement has become a huge burden, now encompassing more than 210 initially incompatible) products.andP;  And now as Computer Associates matures,revenue growth is slowing.andP;  In the fourth quarter of 1989, revenues wereactually 4% lower than they were in the same quarter of 1988.andM;For all of 1989, Computer Associates reported revenues of $1.3 billion(restated to reflect the acquisition of Cullinet), which represents anincrease of 39.8% over 1988's figures.andP;  But earnings fell 6% to $133.2million.andM;Wang is not worried about slowing growth, apparently convinced that thecustomers who came with the Cullinet and ADR acquisitions will soon resumebuying products in earnest.andP;  He's offering these customers new versions oftheir databases, which will run existing applications, as well as databasesbuilt with structured query language (SQL), the standard for DBMSs in the1990s.andP;  That's a far different solution than the one IBM offers its customerswho want their existing applications to be able to take advantage of SQL.andO;They must convert from IMS, IBM's older database software, to DB2, its newerversion.andP;  And they must pay separate licensing fees if they run both IMS andDB2.andP;  Computer Associates puts its solution under a single license fee.andM;The ADR product is already available and customers expect the Cullinetversion, known as IDMS 12.0, by midyear.andP;  George Emmanuel, MIS Programmanager at Hughes Aircraft Co.'s Training Support Systems Group in LosAngeles, says that he and other IDMS customers have been waiting five yearsfor such a product.andP;  &quot;I'm certain we [IDMS sites] will open our coffers in abig way,&quot; he predicts.andM;Wang also is confident that the multitude of new products introduced lastyear will sell well this year.andP;  The most important product, perhaps, is itsApplication Construction Environment (ACE), a pivotal software architecturethat allows customers to develop database applications in Digital EquipmentCorp., IBM and eventually UNIX environments.andP;  Other new offerings includeseven new data center products and 20 enhancements to existing ones,relational extensions to CA's Masterpiece financial system and a new releaseof its SuperCalc5 spreadsheet software.andP;  Also unveiled was its importantCA-DB:cBASE, an applications development system for relational DBMSscompatible with Ashton-Tate Corp.'s popular DBASE language.andM;Wang says that CA now offers ACE, CA-Datacom-DB (the company's premierrelational database) and-unlike IBM-DB2 support for Ashton-Tate's program.andO;He says there are 2 million authorized customers of DBASE and millions whoaren't authorized.andP;  &quot;Even my mother programs in DBASE,&quot; he quips.andM;In the chairman's eyes, all available programmers must be put towork-especially those at the Pc end-if the applications organizations need tocompete in the 1990s are going to be built.andP;  &quot;And we must be able to build ontheir work,&quot; he adds, echoing his principal theme of preserving investment inexisting applications.andP;  &quot;IBM isn't interested in doing this.andP;  There isplanned obsolescence in everything it sells: a product is strategic onlywhile it acts as a magnet for hardware sales.&quot;andM;IS Revenues: $1.22 BillionandM;REGION       ARTHUR            WORLDandM;24         ANDERSEN            45andM;Revenues By RegionandM;N.andP;  AMER.andP;                   61%andM;EUROPE            31%andM;ASIA    7%andM;OTHER 11%andM;ANDERSEN CONSULTINGandM;69 West Washington StreetandM;Chicago, IL 60602andM;(312)-580-0069andM;Can hardware suppliers deliver solutions?

 DATAMATION estimates that 85% of Andersen Consulting is isrelated-putting the firm's 1989 is revenues at $1.2 billion.andM;Andersen's tremendous growth-it far outstrips any of its rivals among themajor accounting firms-is attributable to its willingness to go beyondtraditional management consulting and strategic analysis.andP;

 Andersen has made its presence felt in anumber of industries, from retailing (Sears, Roebuck and Co.) to heavyequipment (Caterpillar Inc.) to consumer electronics (N.V.andP;  Philips' GL).andM;Yet, Andersen carries particular clout in financial services.andP;  The big NewYork City investment banking firm, Salomon Brothers Inc., is using Andersenas the systems integrator and project manager on Fulcrum, the overhaul of itstechnology infrastructure.andP;  Andersen has also designed and implementedtrading systems for the Swiss and German futures exchanges, as well as theItalian and French stock exchanges.andP;

 Partners in the tax and audit units resented thetremendous growth of the consulting side, while the consultants felt theywere being unfairly compensated.andP;  In 1989, Andersen separated the audit/taxand consulting businesses into two separate business units, each with its ownmanaging partner and a new approach that ties compensation more closely toperformance.andM;Even after the restructuring, Andersen Consulting continued to experiencehigh-profile defections, which particularly plagued the company in 1988.andP;  MelBergstein, a former managing partner in charge of technology, joined rivalComputer Sciences Corp. last year.andP;  The proposed merger with PriceWaterhouse, a move that might have helped restore the auditing side's cloutwithin the firm, also fell apart in September amid much talk of Price's &quot;blueblood&quot; culture clashing with Andersen's more  Marine-like&quot; style.andP;  Inaddition, concerns were raised over the close relationship between AndersenConsulting and IBM, which is a Price Waterhouse audit client.andP;  The Securitiesand Exchange Commission bans joint ventures between CPA firms and auditclients.andM;Shaheen says that he wants Andersen to be as independent as possible, but hesees the necessity in forming close alliances between his firm and systemvendors.andP;  &quot;The marketplace is forcing everyone to declare,&quot; says Shaheen.andP;  &quot;Ican't have my firm laid victim to IBM's goals and objectives.andP;  If they see meas a competitor, they will make it harder for me to see their technology.&quot;andM;IS Revenues: $1.115 BillionandM;REGION    NORTHERN              WORLDandM;25         TELECOM               47andM;Revenues By RegionandM;N.andP;

 But not only didStorageTek come back it has rebounded so well that this year it is likely topass the $1 billion mark in annual sales.andM;The company nearly reached the milestone in 1989, achieving $982.5 million insales.andP;  That was up 11% over 1988's revenue figure.andP;  The company's earningspicture appeared to improve even more noticeably last year, as net incomesoared 36.5% to $47.7 million.andP;  But most of its earnings growth came from anextraordinary gain of $11.3 million garnered from the liquidation of someoverseas  assets.andP;  Without the gain, Storage Teck's net income only wouldhave risen 4.3%.andM;Similarly, most observers gave StorageTek long odds on its plans to establisha new automated tape library system as a data center storage standard.andP;  Now,two years after introducing its 4400 Automated Cartridge System  (ACS) to achorus of skepticism, StorageTek has shipped over f,250 of the Capelibraries.andP;  The product last year accounted for about half the company'ssales.andM;StorageTek expects to ship as many as 1,400 of the libraries in 1990, as anumber of current customers begin to order multiple library subsystems.andP;

Analysts agree that if Windows 3.0 lives up to its rumors as theclosest thing yet to a Macintosh environment for the Pc, Microsoft will shipmillions of copies this year, along with another 14 million copies of MS-DOS.andM;Publicly, Gates andamp; Co. is backpedaling on question of how soon OS/2 and itsaccompanying Presentation Manager GUI will capture the corporate world,recommending that users look instead to Windows for their first GUI.andP;  Miffedsoftware manufacturers that had invested heavily in OS/2 applications criedfoul and belatedly set to work developing Windows versions of their products.andM;No one is saying for sure when, or even if, OS/2 will win widespreadacceptance.andP;  But Microsoft can afford to be patient as it reaps in the incomefrom Windows 3.0 and a suite of Windows applications of its own  includingthe Microsoft Word for Windows word-processing package announced in late1989.andP;  &quot;Real growth will be achieved [at Microsoft] because of this bet wemade on the graphical user interface that other people didn't believe in,&quot;says Gates.andM;Next on Microsoft's plate is the matter of improving its networkingofferings-LAN Manager and SQI, Server-both of which fared disappointingly in1989.andP;  With the recent speculation of a merger between Lotus DevelopmentCorp. and Novell Inc. into a new superpower, Microsoft finally had worriesabout a real competitor, especially in the networking arena.andP;  If nothingelse, the merger alarm showed that at least two software companies areconcerned about how big Microsoft's britches have become and how muchinfluence Gates andamp; Co. has on the rest of the industry.andM;IS Revenues: $866.5 MillionandM;REGION                        WORLDandM;28      COMMODORE             51andM;Revenues By RegionandM;N.

Tierney, senior vice president.andP;  &quot;We see this as a naturalprogression in our delivering of technology.andP;  &quot;andM;Already, there is evidence that the company's pitch of providing portabledatabase management software will play as well in the applications arena.andM;But some customers questioned Oracle's commitment to earlier offerings.andP;  Thelong-promised version of Oracle for Digital VAXclusters, for example, failedto materialize last year.andM;Oracle's primary strengths are in the minicomputer market and particularly inthe Digital Equipment Corp. database arena, so how well it copes with themove toward open systems and client-server architectures will affect futuregrowth.andP;  Already, about a third of Oracle's business is UNIX-related.andP;  &quot;Rightnow, we are seeing an aggressive shift to UNIX in the midrange,&quot;  saysTierney.andP;  Having launched support for Novell's Portable NetWare in february1989 and Oracle Server for OS/2 last October, Oracle is also positioned toplay across all major local area network  offerings.andM;With about 48% of its revenues coming from overseas, Oracle is well situatedfor international expansion.andP;  Oracle's growing services business, nowintegrated under a subsidiary called Oracle Complex Systems Corp., isbringing in revenue by combining hardware, software and networking productsin a single package.andP;  Future growth in the 100% range isn't likely byOracle's own estimation.andP;  But, as long as the company can continue to balanceits hyperactive growth against cash flow and customer service concerns,Oracle watching will remain at popular pastime.andM;IS Revenues: $740 MillionandM;REGION      GENERAL              WORLDandM;34          ELECTRIC               58andM;Revenues By RegionandM;N.
