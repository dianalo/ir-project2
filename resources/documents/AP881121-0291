(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Sundstrand Corp. has warned itsshareholders to brace for almost $40 million more in fines, on topof $127 million the company is already paying for defrauding thegovernment on military contracts.   ``The government is continuing to pursue claims of approximately$39.2 million of misallocated costs plus interest,'' Sundstrand saidin a recent third-quarter report to shareholders.   The Rockford-based company is awaiting ``determination letters''on other government contract disputes, besides those related to the$39.2 million, the company said. Those letters are the government'sformal notification that the contractor owes it money.   U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas said today that the additional finesmentioned in Sundstrand's third-quarter report apparently involvecivil issues that were not resolved by settlement of criminalcharges and ``that we did not believe at the time warranted criminalprosecution.''   Valukas said the government and the company were negotiating asettlement of those issues. He would not comment further.   The $39.2 million is nearly twice the $20 million Sundstrand hasleft in its special account to resolve disputes involving militaryand other government contracts.   Company spokesman Claude Vernam said Friday he knows of no plansto put more money into the fund.   However, investment analysts said the company probably would haveto take an additional charge on earnings if Sundstrand has to repaythe entire amount.   ``It sure seems like it,'' said Mitch Quain, an analyst withWertheim Schroder in New York.   Steve Colbert, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Research, said:``They have on the table less than $20 million. The government wants$40 million plus. There's no telling right now what it's going tobe.''   Sundstrand has pleaded guilty in Rockford to four counts ofcriminal fraud. It also pleaded guilty in Seattle to mischarging ongovernment contracts. The company was fined $115 million for theIllinois crimes and $12.3 million for activities of its SundstrandData Control operation in Seattle.   The fines were the largest ever paid for government contractfraud.   A federal grand jury is continuing to look into possible criminalcharges against company employees.</TEXT></DOC>
