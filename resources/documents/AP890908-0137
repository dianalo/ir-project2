The army said it had arrested four Arabs in the slaying of one ofthe alleged collaborators.   Also Friday, a Syrian-backed Palestinian faction claimedresponsibility for firing rockets across the Jordanian border intoIsrael a day earlier.   In the Gaza Strip town of Khan Yunis, troops clashed withstone-throwers and Akran Zaki Hamdan, 13, was killed, the army andhospital officials said.   Hamdan's death brought to 560 the number of Palestinians killedby Israeli soldiers or civilians since the start of the uprisingagainst Israeli occupation nearly 21 months ago. Thirty-nineIsraelis have been killed.   The deaths of the suspected collaborators raised to 110 thenumber of Palestinians killed by fellow Arabs. Most have beenaccused of collaboration.   The slayings came despite an appeal by underground uprisingleaders in their latest leaflet. They asked Palestinian activistsnot to be too quick to kill suspected collaborators.   Cocern about security on the usually quiet Israel-Jordan borderrose this week following the rocket attack Thursday and a guerrillaattack five days earlier in which two Israeli soldiers were killed.   Israel radios and newspapers said military officials believedSyria was behind both attacks.   The first attack was claimed by the Syrian-based Taalat Yakoubfaction of the Palestine Liberation Front. The rocket attack wasclaimed Friday in Damascus by the Marxist Popular Front for theLiberation of Palestine, headed by George Habash.   Zeev Schiff, a military analyst for the Haaretz daily, said Syriamay be using the border attacks to punish Jordan's King Hussein forallowing Iraq to move weapons through Jordan to Christian forces inLebanon. The Christians are battling Syria's army.   Schiff also said the Syrians ``are trying to stir up trouble''between Israel and Jordan.   In the occupied territories Friday, 14 Palestinians were shot andwounded in stone-throwing clashes with Israeli troops, including an11-year-old boy hit with a bullet in the head in the West Bankvillage of Tubas, Arab reports said.   The army announced a raid on the village of Beit Dajan, also inthe occupied West Bank, and said ``a great number'' of Palestinianswere arrested when Israel used helicopters to block suspects fromfleeing into surrounding hills.   The army said last month it would begin using helicopters invillage raids aimed at rounding up activists in the uprising.   Late Friday, 30-year-old Ahmed Izat Imran was found beaten andstabbed to death under a tree near the village of Rujeib in the WestBank, Arab sources said.   Imran reportedly was abducted from his car Thursday night bymasked youths. A search was launched by relatives who later foundthe body, reports said.   In the occupied Gaza Strip, the two alleged collaborators whowere killed were identified as Niman Abu Hilal, 30, who was fatallybeaten at his home in Rafah by masked youths, and Jasser Al Krinawi,24, whose body was found stuffed in a well in the Magazi refugeecamp.   The army said four Arabs were taken into custody in connectionwith the Krinawi case.</TEXT></DOC>
