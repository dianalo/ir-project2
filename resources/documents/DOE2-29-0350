Further, naturalgas is discussed as an energy source, i.e. its origins, reserves, futureprosepects, and alternatives (LNG, biogas, pit gas and sewage gas). Thereis a special chapter on the projecting of heating systems, i.e. flowand radiator systems, energy saving options, measurements of gas andheat consumption. The book presents a detailed example of how to calculatethe natural gas combustion rate. It also analyzes the chemical compositionof natural gas and points out its environmental acceptability. Finally,the available NO/sub x/ reduction systems for gas engines are described.(HAG).</TEXT></DOC>
