Senior Prosecutor Kang Won-il said Chun Kyung-hwan broke downearly today after 20 hours of interrogation and admitted heembezzled funds during his seven years as head of the semi-officialSaemaul (New Community) Movement.   Kang said Chun, who at first denied the charges, confessed afterbeing shown evidence and said he used the money for land and stockspeculation.   ``Mr. Chun has largely admitted to most of the charges afterprosecutors showed him evidence and through cross-examination,''Kang said.   Kang said formal corruption and embezzlement charges were beingprepared and Chun would be charged today or Thursday. If convicted,Chun could receive punishments ranging from 10 years imprisonmentto the death sentence.   Prosecutors said Chun still denied charges that he peddledgovernment influence and diverted funds overseas, according to Kang.   Officials said he also blamed his surbordinates for taking mostof the funds missing from Saemaul, a huge nationwide organizationfounded in 1971 to promote urban and rural development.   But Kang, who has headed the investigation into Saemaul, saidthere was extensive evidence implicating Chun as the key figure inmassive corruption involving embezzlement, influence peddling andextorting stocks, land and money from businesses.   ``My investigators have already secured enough evidence toincriminate and prosecute Chun,'' he said.   Prosecutors said Chun was implicated in the misappropriation of$9.3 million. They said investigators were checking evidence Chunembezzled another $6 million.   The government investigation into corruption within Saemaul hasbecome a major political scandal. About 200 Saemaul and governmentofficials have been questioned about corruption or covering it upto protect former President Chun and his family.   Five suspects were charged with embezzlement and fraudulent landsales Tuesday night, prosecutors said, two of them top Saemaulofficials and brothers-in-law of the younger Chun.   One brother-in-law, Hwang Hung-sik, tried to commit suicidetwice Tuesday while in custody, once trying to jump from afive-story window.   Former President Chun, who has not been implicated in theSaemaul scandal, is on a private tour of the United States and metwith President Reagan at the White House last week.   Opposition parties are demanding the former president return toSouth Korea immediately to explain his role in the Saemaul scandal.Opposition leaders charge the former president must have beeninvolved in the affair.   Prosecutors say the younger Chun, who was appointed by hisbrother, used his position as Saemaul leader to divert governmentand private donations, sell influence and pressured businesses tomake gifts of money, land and stocks.   Widespread government corruption was long suspected under theauthoritarian Chun regime. But criticism of the president and hisfamily were not tolerated and the allegations were ignored.   The younger Chun resigned as Saemaul chief in 1987 after beinglinked to underworld gangsters. He fled to Japan April 18 when newsof the government probe surfaced, but returned two days later toface questioning.   President Roh Tae-woo, who took power Feb. 25, is thought tohave approved the Saemaul probe to discredit the former presidentand end his predecessor's attempts to retain power and influencewithin the government.   Some Chun loyalists were purged from the governing DemocraticJustice Party earlier this month and Roh blocked the formerpresident's attempts to retain substantial power as a governmentadviser.   Roh, a former general who helped put Chun in power with militarybacking in 1980, promised during the presidential election campaignto root out and end official corruption.</TEXT></DOC>
