Farley, a 44-year-old former encyclopedia salesman, has built a $2 billion business empire and made himself a millionaire several times over.    Now he wants to become a household word. And to that end, his Farley Industries Inc. plans to spend at least $2.5 million on a series of image-building television advertisements in one of the most unusual corporate marketing campaigns yet.    Unlike Lee Iacocca, who has promoted Chrysler Corp.'s cars in personal ad appearances, Mr. Farley won't even mention his company's Fruit of the Loom underwear or other products. Instead, the maverick industrialist, dubbed &quot;Megabucks Bill&quot; by local gossip columnists, will tout hard work, sound management -- and Bill Farley.    The campaign is aimed not only at customers but at policy makers, whom he hopes to convince that stronger industry, rather than protectionism, is the answer to the trade deficit. Moreover, while Mr. Farley himself has been reticent about the matter, associates acknowledge that the ads will give him visibility should he decide to run for political office -- a move he has considered for the future.    Three of the ads, which could run as early as this summer, have been produced so far. In one, a blue-collar worker walks into a football locker room, where he is ignored by the coaches. Enter Mr. Farley in a voice-over: &quot;Just imagine joining a team where the coach doesn't care about you, where no one thinks about your working conditions, your health, your pride.&quot; He goes on to attack the &quot;uncaring attitude&quot; of American management and extol &quot;feeling good about yourself and your company . . . (as) the only way to win.&quot;    The 60-second commercial ends with a close-up of the youthful chairman and chief executive officer. &quot;I'm Bill Farley,&quot; he says. &quot;And at Farley Industries, this is no pie-in-the-sky philosophy. It's reality, and it's working.&quot;    The television strategy reflects Mr. Farley's management style, with its emphasis on instilling work-ethic values. He has been known to give impromptu speeches on loyalty and product quality to factory workers while standing on a folding chair. &quot;I thanked some of our employees for their pride at the dedication of a plant expansion recently, and they cheered,&quot; he recalls with satisfaction. &quot;It was like a political rally.&quot;    Outside the company, such recognition has been harder to win. Mr. Farley was forced to delay a planned $510 million public offering of stock in his apparel unit last November when institutional investors shunned it as overpriced. After the unit, Farley Apparel Inc., was renamed Fruit of the Loom Inc. for its best-known brand, a scaled-back, $243 million version of the offering quickly sold out last month.    Mr. Farley's political aspirations are longer-term. A self-described independent, he has considered running in 1990 for the U.S. Senate seat held by Democrat Paul Simon of Illinois, or for governor of the state. If he does, the ads will have given him needed exposure. They are likely to appear initially in three markets -- Washington, New York and Chicago -- during network news shows and such politically oriented programs as CBS Inc.'s &quot;Face the Nation&quot; and National Broadcasting Co.'s &quot;Meet the Press.&quot;    Changes inside the company may prove helpful, too. Last March, Mr. Farley brought John M. Albertine, a trade-group lobbyist and former speech writer for Democratic Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, to Farley Industries as vice chairman. Mr. Albertine, who still lives near Washington, keeps an office there and boosts Mr. Farley's visibility while he buttonholes officials about trade and economic issues.    Mr. Farley's decision to go public with both his image and at least a part of his company marks a sharp departure from his previous, private style. The son of a Pawtucket, R.I., postman, Mr. Farley long shunned would-be investors, using leveraged buyouts to build his empire. In 1985, he more than doubled the size of his company with the $1 billion acquisition of Northwest Industries Inc.    The nature of Farely Industries is at least part of the reason for the campaign's non-sell approach. Other corporate subjects of personal ad campaigns, such as Mr. Iacocca and Victor Kiam II (the man who liked Remington razors so much that he bought the company), have had well-known, brand-name products to sell. But Farley Industries' offerings include such unglamorous items as screws and locomotive bells.    &quot;I don't know what Farley would do pushing screws and castings on TV,&quot; says Steven Dammers, senior vice president of Grey Advertising Inc., the agency that prepared the ads. &quot;The average person isn't interested.&quot;    Nor does Mr. Farley want viewers to remember him displaying the company's latest line of underwear. &quot;One of my biggest concerns,&quot; he says, &quot;is coming off like a huckster.&quot;    Some Farley executives have wondered, though, if the campaign is the best marketing vehicle for the company. &quot;We had intense discussions about it,&quot; Mr. Albertine says, particularly over whether viewers will get the point. &quot;But,&quot; he explains, &quot;we decided that the ads contain the message we want to get out about the company's quality concerns. We also think the ads will be good for recruiting.&quot;    Such potential benefits seem to have outweighed any doubts -- in light of Mr. Farley's political aspirations -- about the ethics of his promoting himself with the company's money. &quot;He's addressing the needs of his company and workers,&quot; says Sidney J. Levy, chairman of the marketing department at Northwestern University's J.L. Kellogg Graduate School of Management. &quot;If he's also thinking about his career, that's probably natural. Everybody has goals and ambition in mind; there's nothing malevolent about that.&quot;    However, Mr. Levy adds, the campaign &quot;could come off like propaganda. Cynics may conclude, 'This guy's just running for office. He ought to give equal time to somebody.'&quot;    For now, Mr. Farley is busy building a power base here. He recently threw a business reception at Farley Industries' Sears Tower headquarters for 400 of the city's movers and shakers. Throughout the evening he held court, inviting bankers, executives and politicians -- including former Chicago Mayor Jane Byrne -- to stand in line to speak with him.    He also addressed the crowd, expounding the virtues of hard work while tuxedoed caterers poured wine and a violin ensemble played nearby. And lest anyone forget the underpinnings of his success, he had assistants present departing guests with some down-to-earth gifts: Fruit of the Loom athletic socks. </TEXT></DOC>
