But killing politicalsmear campaigns may prove a very tough sell.   Alex Kroll, who was elected chairman of the AmericanAssociation of Advertising Agencies at the group's annualmeeting here, expects to make the crusade against negativepolitical ads a cornerstone of his one-year term. He iscalling for a voluntary code of conduct for politicaladvertisers, much the way consumer advertising has its owncode and self-regulations.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;There are two advertising industries,&quot; says Mr. Kroll,who is chairman of ad agency Young andamp; Rubicam. One sells soapand soda; the other, in the name of selling candidates, often&quot;is destructive, driving people away&quot; from politics and thepolls.   Negative political campaigns have long been a sore pointfor the ad industry. Traditional ad agencies don't handlepolitical campaigns at all for fear of alienating clients,leaving the job instead to political consultants andunaffiliated ad executives. Yet the smear campaigns thatoften result drag down the agencies' reputations anyway, theysay.   The barrage of negative political ads &quot;reflects terriblyon our business,&quot; says Mark Goldstein, president of EarlePalmer Brown Cos., Bethesda, Md. &quot;It's done by people whoaren't held to any of the ethical or regulatory standards weare held to.&quot; Consumers, adds William Weithas, chairman ofInterpublic Group's Lintas agency, associate all advertising&quot;with the garbage that is put out. I'm appalled by some ofthe things I see.&quot;   But ad executives face an uphill battle. The comingelection year will offer up more mudslinging ads than everbefore, executives attending the association's meetingpredict. Even if some political consultants do lay offnegative ads, the candidate &quot;can always find somebody to doit,&quot; says Ralph Rydholm, chairman and chief creative officerof Chicago-based Tatham-Laird andamp; Kudner. After all, he pointsout, the candidate is the client, and &quot;clients get theadvertising they want.&quot;   The fact is, negative ads can work. Media experts believePresident Bush's 1988 commercial talking about Massachusettsrapist Willie Horton -- who raped again while out on aweekend furlough from prison -- helped seal opponent MichaelDukakis's fate, as did Bush ads picturing a ratherridiculous-looking Mr. Dukakis sitting atop a tank.   Already, the battle over negative political ads isbecoming nasty itself. Political consultants are up in armsover the idea that an ad agency group would attempt to reinthem in. &quot;I find it remarkably hypocritical,&quot; says MandyGrunwald, a principal with Washington political consultantsGreer, Margolis, Mitchell, Grunwald andamp; Associates. &quot;I don'tthink there are {product-advertising} standards that weshould be envious of. . . . If that's what I'm supposed toaspire to, I'm looking down.&quot;   Ms. Grunwald says negative ads are already held in checkby the ultimate threat: &quot;If you personalize it, or if it'sirrelevent, you will lose. It will blow up in your face.&quot;With political advertising, she says, &quot;reporters andopponents scrutinize every word, in a way theproduct-advertising industry has never had to deal with.&quot;What's more, the consultants' own trade group has beenworking on ad guidelines.   Mr. Kroll, though, argues that all negative advertisingdefeats its purpose because it alienates so many voters.Negative ads, he says, help explain why voter turnout in thelast few elections has been so poor.   To cut the negative out of political advertising, Mr.Kroll is advocating several steps. Among them: a code ofconduct requiring advertisers to clearly identify the sponsor(no ambiguous &quot;Friends of . . .&quot; in fine print), and avoidinginnuendo or opponent-bashing. He also envisions givingcandidates five minutes of free air time apiece in additionto paid ads, to give voters a more in-depth look than a30-second soundbite can afford.   Ironically, the same executives who cry &quot;First Amendment&quot;every time a threat to beer or cigarette ads rears its head,are demanding greater restrictions on political ads. Somewould even do away with paid political ads altogether;others, like Sean Fitzpatrick, vice chairman of Interpublic'sMcCann-Erickson agency, say all political ads should berequired to be at least five minutes, with the candidateon-screen for at least half of that.   &quot;One of the most dangerous things in America today ispolitical advertising,&quot; he says. &quot;The black arts ofadvertising shouldn't be used to elect our leaders.&quot;   ---   RJR Seeks Winston Advice                                                                                                          R.J. Reynolds is talking to Young andamp; Rubicam and TroneAdvertising about a major repositioning of its Winstoncigarette brand, currently handled at FCB/Leber KatzPartners, the unit of RJR Nabisco said.   A Reynolds spokeswoman insisted the Winston account isn'tin review but said the tobacco company has asked FCB/LeberKatz and the other two agencies &quot;to take a look at somespecific opportunities for the brand.&quot; She wouldn't describethem but added: &quot;LKP is the agency for the brand and willremain the agency for the brand.&quot; According to LeadingNational Advertisers, which tracks ad spending, Reynoldsspent about $17 million advertising Winston in 1990.   People familiar with the plans said a repositioning forthe troubled Winston brand is in the works. The agencies aredeveloping ad campaigns to introduce new packaging for thesmokes. FCB/Leber Katz is the New York agency of Foote, Coneandamp; Belding. Young andamp; Rubicam handles Reynolds's Camel brand;Trone creates ads for its Dakota brand.   In what Reynolds is expected to tout as an industrybreakthrough, the new Winston package will use aluminumpolyester to greatly extend the freshness of its cigarettes.Cigarettes typically become stale from one to three monthsafter the date of manufacture, and Reynolds is betting thatthe packaging will be a key factor in motivating puffers tochoose Winston.   ---   Ad Notes. . . .
