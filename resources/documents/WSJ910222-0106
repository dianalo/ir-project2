Despite expectations that the women's movement would bringgreater male-female equality in housework, a large-sampleConference Board study finds that two out of five husbandsalmost never do the family cooking, wash up after meals,clean the house or shop for food. Better than three out offive &quot;rarely&quot; or &quot;never&quot; do the laundry, while a whopping 86%never or almost never iron.   Barely one out of six says he does the laundry &quot;often&quot; or&quot;almost always.&quot; A little better than one-fifth cook or cleanthe house with any frequency. Three in 10 claim to do thedishes a good part of the time. Food shopping is the areawhere men pitch in the most; about one-third say they do thehousehold shopping often or almost always.   In most of these areas, the Conference Board says, itmakes &quot;only a slight difference&quot; whether the wife has a job.   The study also finds women often doing chorestraditionally considered a man's province. Seven out of 10women &quot;almost always&quot; or &quot;often&quot; pay the household bills.One-third always or frequently do the family tax return;almost half take out the garbage a good part of the time; andabout one-fourth make arrangements for car repairs. Three outof 10 do a great deal of painting and wallpapering.   One ray of hope for feminists: Younger men seem moredisposed than their fathers to share in housework. Aboutone-fifth of the men between ages 25 and 35 always or oftendo the laundry, approximately double the rate for men between55 and 65. Better than one-fourth of younger men are frequenthouse cleaners, compared with well under one in five in theolder group.                                                                                                          People in Rural Areas Get   Quicker Start on Families                                                                                                          YOUNG, RURAL men and women tend to marry and have kidsearlier than their urban counterparts.   Demographer William P. O'Hare of the University ofLouisville compared the family situation of a large sample of1980 high school graduates six years after graduation. Amongthose from rural high schools (schools outside a metropolitanarea), 50% were married; about one-quarter of the entirerural group was married and had at least one child. Bycontrast, only 37% of the graduates of city and suburban highschools were married six years later, and only 17% weremarried with one or more children.   Only 44% of the rural group were unmarried and childless,compared with 57% of the urban graduates.   Because the South has a disproportionate share of the U.S.rural population, Mr. O'Hare looked at the Southern pictureseparately. He found that graduates of Southern high schools,whether rural or urban, were more likely to be married andhave children than those from other parts of the country. Butwithin the South, the rural school graduates were still morefamily-oriented than those coming from urban schools. Forexample, three out of 10 young rural high school graduateswere married and had one or more kids six years later,compared with only two out of 10 graduates of urban schools.   Mr. O'Hare notes that real earnings of young rural workersdropped far more in the early 1980s than those of young urbanworkers. Hence, he says, his findings of earlier familyformation in rural areas seem to challenge a leadingdemographic theory: that people tend to postpone marriage andhave fewer children in times of economic uncertainty.                                                                                                          How Work, Home Stress   Affects Working Couples                                                                                                          HUSBANDS are more likely than wives to bring to work thepressures they feel at home.   University of Denver psychologist Niall Bolger and threecolleagues studied &quot;stress contagion&quot; in working couples: theextent to which pressure at work spills over to createtension at home or vice versa, and the extent to which stressfelt by one partner at work crosses over to put strain on thespouse at home. For six weeks, 166 couples in the Detroitarea kept daily diaries of when they had extra-heavy loads atwork or at home, or when they had arguments with co-workersor family members.   The researchers discovered that men far more often thanwomen had arguments or felt overburdened at work if they'dhad heavy household chores the night before or arguments withspouse or kids. Mr. Bolger hypothesizes that differences inupbringing have made women better able to handle both homeand work tasks.   Surprisingly, however, there was less evidence thananticipated that heavy demands or arguments at work spilledover to create strains at home. To the extent this didhappen, however, it was again more likely to come after thehusband had a bad day at work than after the wife did.   Another conclusion: Both husbands and wives tend to cutback on household chores after a particularly stressful dayat work, something the authors call a &quot;stress compensationprocess.&quot;                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          COMPARED WITH nonsmokers, smokers are much less likely toconsume vegetables, fruits, high-fiber grains, mineralsupplements and other foods or nutrients generally regardedas cancer-protective, a National Cancer Institute researchteam reports. . . . One-fourth of all U.S. households werevictimized by a crime or theft in 1989, according to theBureau of Justice Statistics. This is the same level as ineach of the four preceding years.</TEXT></DOC>
