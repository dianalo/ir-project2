A provider of long-distance service in 24 states, Mr.Ebbers's LDDS Communications Inc. woos small and medium-sizedbusinesses -- often with a personal touch that is hard forgiant American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. to match. In doingso, the Jackson, Miss., company has shown that one of thebest ways to compete with a larger rival is simply to adoptdifferent priorities.</LP><TEXT>   Small carriers such as LDDS own their own switches butcan't afford to build their own transmission networks, oreven to advertise heavily. But they can have highly focusedmarketing staffs -- and they often know how to appeal tosmall-business owners. &quot;Their customers buy from them becausethey can talk to somebody face to face,&quot; says W. Mark Dunkel,an analyst at Robinson-Humphrey Co., an Atlanta securitiesfirm.   While big carriers tend to sell small businesses uniformproducts for nationwide distribution, LDDS tries to tailorservice to each customer's calling patterns to maximizerouting efficiency and cut costs. Mr. Ebbers says the ratestructures of different customers are rarely the same.   Such customized service has helped LDDS defy predictionsof its demise. When the 1984 breakup of the former BellSystem opened up a market for alternative long-distancecarriers, some analysts expected the largest new entrants,such as MCI Communications Corp., to kill off the smallerones before long. &quot;LDDS has proven that wrong,&quot; Mr. Dunkelsays.   LDDS's net income for 1990 was $9.8 million, a tenfoldincrease in four years. Revenue last year reached $154.4million, up sixteenfold in the same period, partly because ofacquisitions. Since 1983, the company has spent more than$200 million for about two dozen companies.   In national over-the-counter trading, the stock closedyesterday at $23, up 25 cents, giving the company a marketvaluation of more than $332 million.   Mr. Ebbers, the 49-year-old chief executive officer, ownsa 19% stake valued at more than $61 million.   When LDDS solicits business, it does so only in person,never by telephone. It also places a premium on pressing theflesh when it comes to service after the sale. Companyrepresentatives make office calls once a month to customerswith monthly bills of more than $1,000. Customers such as PMTServices Inc., which makes $50,000 in phone calls everymonth, are coddled even more.   Gregory Daily, chief operating officer of PMT, aNashville, Tenn., marketer of credit-card processingservices, says he hears from LDDS once a week, not countingthe annual Christmas luncheon that the company is invited toattend. He says Mr. Ebbers himself has visited PMT severaltimes.   &quot;The reason I went with them three years ago was to get abetter rate,&quot; Mr. Daily says. &quot;But I decided to stay withthem because they do a fantastic job of taking care of mewhenever I have the slightest problem.&quot; He adds: &quot;You tendnot to get that from the bigger companies. LDDS has treatedme like I'm their only client.&quot;   Industry people say the best way to sign up and keep asmall or medium-sized business is to employ a direct-salesand customer-service staff that makes office calls. The bigcarriers sell directly and attend personally to bigcompanies. But the big carriers generally can't justify theexpense of such marketing for small customers.   While such personal service has helped LDDS expandrapidly, maintaining this growth may get a lot tougher. Forone thing, the company has borrowed heavily to buy otherlong-distance carriers. The company's $165 million inlong-term debt dwarfs shareholder equity of $88.5 million.Excluding intangible assets such as good will, the companyhas a negative net worth of $111.5 million. This will make itdifficult for the company to continue borrowing so heavily tofinance growth, analysts say -- although LDDS disagrees.   Moreover, LDDS's profit-margin improvement may be levelingoff, analysts say. Recent gains have resulted largely fromthe falling cost of transmission services. Like other smallcarriers, LDDS leases transmission facilities from ATandamp;T, MCIand other larger carriers, which had been cutting prices touse up excess capacity. But now the price cuts are abating.Concedes Mr. Ebbers, &quot;We may have entered a phase wheremargins have stabilized.&quot;   Then there is the ever-present threat of the big carriersthemselves, especially ATandamp;T. Though LDDS is a competitor toATandamp;T, it and other small concerns together control littlemore than 1% of the total long-distance market, according toanalysts. But after years of losing ground to its new rivals,ATandamp;T for three consecutive quarters has increased its shareof the total long-distance market. Several proposals beforethe Federal Communications Commission could add even more toATandamp;T's competitive strength.   Even now, ATandamp;T, MCI and United Telecommunications Inc.'sSprint unit are pushing new programs aimed specifically atsmall business. &quot;ATandamp;T, Sprint and MCI have publicly statedthat their intent is to be more aggressive in going aftersmall and medium-sized businesses,&quot; says Anthony Clark, anindustry analyst with Wheat First Securities Inc. inRichmond, Va. &quot;That's LDDS's target market.&quot;   The big carriers' interest in such customers wasn't sokeen in 1983 when the owners of LDDS's predecessor, LongDistance Discount Services Inc., persuaded Mr. Ebbers, then ahotelier, to invest in the company. &quot;The financialprojections were so unbelievable that even if they were 80%wrong it was still a good deal,&quot; Mr. Ebbers says.   But it was a bad deal -- for a long time, anyway. By 1985,the company was incurring losses of $25,000 a month. Afterfailing to sell the company, the other owners signed it overto Mr. Ebbers, who still liked its concept of focusing onsmall-business customers. Four years later, Mr. Ebbers mergedthe company into Advantage Cos., an even smallerlong-distance company, which then changed its name to LDDSCommunications.</TEXT></DOC>
