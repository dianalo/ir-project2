(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A state university that held a Sexuality Weekfeaturing a ``condom dance'' and a lecture on the female erogenouszone drew complaints from a senior state senator, who called theschool ``a center of carnal knowledge.''   Republican state Sen. James Donovan, chairman of the Senate'sEducation Committee, said Tuesday the State University of New Yorkat Albany ``terribly misplaced'' its spending priorities by holdingSexuality Week.   But a spokeswoman for the university, noting that only 38students attended the ``condom dance,'' said it's wrong to criticizethe university's morals.   ``It was a weeklong series of programs designed to teach studentshow to be responsible sexual partners and how their behavior affectsrelationships with other,'' Christine McKnight, spokeswoman for theuniversity, said of Sexuality Week.   Donovan, however, said ``every tax-paying citizen'' of New Yorkshould be aware of Sexuality Week.   ``SUNY Albany has always been a pillar'' of the state universitysystem, the senator said. ``But instead of becoming an institutionknown for its academic prowess, it is becoming a center of carnalknowledge.''   ``All of us agree that we must combat AIDS and that educationabout sex can contribute heavily to this fight,'' Donovan said. ``Icannot believe that the state of New York and its university systembelieve that `condom dances' are the solution.''   Students attending the ``condom dance'' were given free condomsand treated to ``four hours of sexually explicit music,'' Donovansaid. Another event of ``Sexuality Week'' was a 15-minute film andlecture on the so-called ``G Spot,'' a supposed female erogenouszone.   McKnight said most of the programs were funded by studentorganizations, like the Student Association and Inter-FraternityCouncil. She said she wasn't sure if any university funds were usedfor events.   Sexuality Week is held on other campuses across the country tohighlight issues of safe sex during the week of Valentine's Day,McKnight said. It's the fifth straight year it's been held at SUNYAlbany and hasn't been a controversy in the past, she said.   People who came to see the presentation on the ``G Spot''expecting a dirty movie instead saw a very informative film andlecture, she said.   And the turnout for the ``condom dance'' was ``disappointing,''she said, probably because it was held just before a three-dayholiday weekend.</TEXT></DOC>
