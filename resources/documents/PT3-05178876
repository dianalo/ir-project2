These new platinum compounds are easy to encapsulate in      liposomes at high efficiencies. They are further characterized as platinum      (II) four coordinate complex having the formula:      ##STR1##      wherein R.sub.1 and R.sub.2 are carboxylato monoanions bearing a      hydrophobic radical function or a single carboxylato dianion bearing a      hydrophobic radical function and R.sub.3 is a vicinal diaminoalkane or      vicinal diaminocycloalkane. The complex is substantially soluble in      methanol or chloroform and substantially insoluble in water. Said complex      may be incorporated into phospholipid liposomes. Such platinum complexes      encapsulated in phospholipid liposomes are useful for chemotherapy of      platinum complex-sensitive tumors. </PAL></ABST><PARN> <PAR>  This patent application is a divisional of U.S. patent application Ser.

No. 788,750, filed on      Oct. 18, 1985, now abandoned. </PAR></PARN><BSUM> <PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  This invention relates to newly synthesized platinum complexes with      hydrophobic properties. The use of liposomes incorporating these new and      previously synthesized complexes in anti-tumor chemotherapy is also      described. </PAR><PAR>  Cis-platinum (CDDP) is a highly effective drug in the treatment of several      neoplastic diseases in humans (Loehrer et al (1984) Ann. Int. Med. V 100,      pp 704-713). However, its use is limited by severe systemic toxicity,      particularly nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity (Zwelling et al Platinum      Complexes. In: Pharmacologic principles of cancer treatment (1982) Ed by      B. A. Chabner, Saunders, Philadelphia, Pa.). In an attempt to modify the      therapeutic index of CDDP, new derivatives have been synthesized during      the last decade. However, the development of some promising analogues has      been prevented by their low hydrosolubility, which decreases their      potential for clinical use (Burchenal et al (1979) Cancer Treat. Rep. V      63, pp 1493-1497). </PAR><PAR>  Liposomes are lipid vesicles which may form spontaneously upon addition of      an aqueous solution to a dry lipid film (Mayhew et al, In: Liposomes      (1983) Ed by Marc J. Ostro, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y.).      Liposomes may be used as drug carriers of hydrophobic or hydrophilic drugs      entrapped in their hydrophobic or hydrophilic compartments respectively.      Multilamellar liposomes are multilayer lipid vesicles (MLV) that are      particularly suited for carrying hydrophobic drugs since their hydrophobic      compartment is larger than their hydrophilic compartment. When injected      intravenously (iv) in animals, (Kasi et al (1984) Int. J. Nucl. Med. Biol.      V 11 pp 35-37, Lopez-Berestein et al. (1)(1984) Cancer Drug Deliv. V 1, pp      199-205) and humans (Lopez-Berestein et al (2)(1984), Cancer Res. V 44, pp      375-378), MLV concentrate in the liver, spleen and other organs rich in      reticuloendothelial (RES) cells. </PAR><PAR>  Liposomes have been previously used in vitro to deliver chemotherapeutic      agents, (Mayhew et al, Liposomes (1983), Ed by Ostro, Marcel Dekker, Inc.,      New York, N.Y.) and immunomodulators and anti-fungal agents in vitro      (Mehta et al (1984), Immunology V 51 pp 517-527, and in vivo in animals      (Lopez-Berestein et al (4)(1984) Clin Exp Metastasis V 2 pp 127-137 and      Lopez-Berestein et al (1983), J Inf Dis V 147, pp 937-945) and in humans      (Lopez-Berestein et al (1985) J. Inf. Dis. V 151 pp 704-710). </PAR><PAR>  Recent studies show that liposomes can reduce certain types of drug-related      toxicities such as doxorubicin cardiotoxicity (Forssen et al (1981) Proc.      Natl. Acad. Sci. V 78 pp 1873-1877, Olson et al (1982), Eur. J. Cancer      Clin. Oncol. V 18 pp 167-176, Gabizon et al (1982) Cancer Res. V 42 pp      4734-4739, Herman et al (1983) Cancer Res. V 43 pp 5427-5432) and CDDP      nephrotoxicity, (Freise et al (1982), Arch. Int. Pharmacodynamie Therapie      V 258 pp 180-192) and may increase antitumor activity as a result of a      slow release mechanism (Mayhew et al (1978) Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. V 308, pp      371-386, Patel et al (1984) Int. J. Cancer V 34 pp 717-723) a higher drug      uptake by tumor cells or due to a more selective organ distribution      (Gabizon et al (1983) Cancer Res. V 43, pp 4730-4735 and Mayhew et al      (1983 ), Cancer Drug Deliv. V 1 pp 43-58). In U.S. Pat. No. 4,330,534      N.sup.4 -acylcytosine arabinoside incorporated into liposomes, for      example, was found to be therapeutically effective when administered to      tumor-bearing animals. In spite of these promising results, the clinical      application of antitumor agents encapsulated in liposomes has been      delayed, mainly due to formulation, drug stability and large scale      production problems. </PAR><PAR>  CDDP has been previously encapsulated in MLV but with a very low      encapsulation efficiency (7.4%) and poor stability (75% at 48 hours in      0.9% NaCl solution) (Freise et al (1982) Arch. Int. Pharmacodynamie      Therapie V 258 pp 180-192). </PAR><PAR>  In U.S. Pat. No. 4,256,652 are described certain platinum compounds      comprising resolved stereoisomers of 1,2 diaminocyclohexane (DACH). The      isomers utilized were cis-DACH, trans-RR-DACH and trans-SS-DACH. The      platinum compounds described therein contained, in addition to a resolved      DACH isomer, two hydrophilic platinum ligands such as bromide, iodide,      nitrate, bromoacetate, sulfate or glucuronate. The platinum compounds      comprising the trans-RR-DACH were described as often more therapeutically      effective than those bearing cis-DACH. </PAR><PAR>  In European Patent Application No. 83306726.7 certain platinum compounds      are described which may comprise diaminocyclohexane (non-stereochemically      resolved) and do comprise phosphatidyl groups having fatty acid      substituents. These compounds are described as largely insoluble in plasma      and preferably employed with lipid vesicle carriers. The platinum      compound-phospholipid vesicles were preferably prepared by a sonic      oscillation procedure which characteristically yields unilamellar      vesicles. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The present invention comprises a platinum (II) four-coordinate complex      having the formula:      ##STR2##      In this formula R.sub.1 and R.sub.2 are each carboxylates bearing a      hydrophobic radical function, most preferably neodecyl, or, when linked      together, are a dicarboxylato bearing a hydrophobic radical function. The      R.sub.3 and R.sub.4 are each:      ##STR3##      In this latter formula, R.sub.5 is selected from the group consisting of      hydrogen, an alkyl having from 2 to 6 carbon atoms such as isopropyl,      aryl, aralkyl, alkenyl, a cycloalkyl such as cyclohexyl, cycloalkenyl and      a combination thereof.

When R.sub.3 and R.sub.4 are so linked together, they are      preferably selected from the group consisting of cycloalkyl-1,2-diamino      functions having between about 3 and 7 carbon atoms, and alkyl-1,2-diamino      having between about 2 and 12 carbon atoms, preferably ethyl. A preferred      cycloalkyl-1,2-diamino component is 1,2-diaminocyclohexane, preferably in      the trans-R,R- or trans-S,S- form. </PAR><PAR>  In the above-described complex the carboxylato of R.sub.1 and R.sub.2 is      preferably an alkylcarboxylato having between about 5 and 20 carbon atoms,      an arylcarboxylato wherein aryl is phenyl, naphthyl, or an alkylphenyl      wherein the alkyl phenyl has between about 12 and 16 carbon atoms. </PAR><PAR>  When the complex contains R.sub.1 and R.sub.2 as a dicarboxylato, the      dicarboxylato is preferably an alkyldicarboxylato having between about 5      and 20 carbon atoms, or an aryldicarboxylato wherein aryl is naphthyl,      phenyl, or alkylphenyl wherein the alkyl of the alkylphenyl has between      about 6 and 12 carbon atoms. As used in the above description the term      aryl is defined further as a function preferably having between about 6      and 14 carbon atoms. Likewise the term alkenyl is preferably a function      having between about 5 and 20 carbon atoms. </PAR><PAR>  The cycloalkyl referred to in the present descriptions is preferably a      function having between about 3 and 12 carbon atoms. The cycloalkenyl term      as used above is preferably a function having between about 5 and 20      carbon atoms. The term aralkyl as used above is a function preferably      having between about 7 and 20 carbon atoms and contains linked aryl and      alkyl portions. The aryl portion herein preferably has between about 6 and      10  carbon atoms and the alkyl portion preferably has between about 1 and      10 carbon atoms. When R.sub.3 and R.sub.4 are taken together they are      preferably a cycloalkyl-1,2-diamino having between about 3 and 20 carbon      atoms. The alkyl ring of the cycloalkyl preferably has between about 3 and      12 carbon atoms. </PAR><PAR>  A further aspect of the present invention concerning the platinum (II)      four-coordinate complex having the formula:      ##STR4##      concerns the case where R.sub.1 and R.sub.2, taken together, are a      dicarboxylato, preferably a cis dicarboxylato, of the formula:      ##STR5##      where R.sub.6 is alkyl having between about 10 and 20 carbon atoms,      preferably pentyl, neopentyl, decyl or neodecyl and R.sub.7 and R.sub.8      are each hydrogen or an alkyl having between about 1 and 5 carbon atoms. </PAR><PAR>  As described above R.sub.3 and R.sub.4 are each:      ##STR6## </PAR><PAR>  When R.sub.3 and R.sub.4 are taken together they are selected from the      group consisting of cycloalkyl-1,2-diamino having between about 3 and 7      carbon atoms, and alkyl-1,2-diamino having between about 2 and 12 carbon      atoms. The cycloalkyl-1,2-diamino is preferably 1,2-diaminocyclohexane and      more preferably trans-R,R-1,2-diaminocyclohexane or      trans-S,S-1,2-diaminocyclohexane. This complex is, as described above,      substantially soluble in methanol or chloroform and substantially      insoluble in water. </PAR><PAR>  Important aspects of the present invention involve liposomes comprising      fatty substances such as phospholipids, optionally cholesterol, and the      four-coordinate platinum complexes described above, as well as the      preparation and uses of these liposomes. Liposomes of the present      invention contain the platinum complex and the phospholipid in a preferred      ratio between about 1 to 10 and about 1 to 30, a more preferred ratio      being 1 to 15. </PAR><PAR>  Preferred phospholipids of these liposomes include phosphatidylglycerol,      phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin, phosphatidic acid or      phosphatidylserine, the more preferred phospholipids being      phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine or a combination thereof. The      most preferred phosphatidylglycerol is one consisting essentially of      dimyristoylphosphatidylglycerol and the most preferred phosphatidylcholine      is one consisting essentially of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine. When the      liposomes of the present invention comprise      dimyristoylphosphatidylglycerol and dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine they      are preferably in a ratio between about 1-10 and 10-1, more preferably in      a ratio of about 3 to 7. </PAR><PAR>  The liposomes of the present invention may be multilamellar, unilamellar or      have an undefined lamellar construction. A pharmaceutical composition      comprising the liposomes of and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or      diluent may be used for the therapy of disease conditions such as cancer. </PAR><PAR>  A focal point of the present invention involves a method of treating a host      animal afflicted with tumor cells sensitive to the presence of a platinum      (II) four-coordinate complex. This method comprises administering to the      host an amount of the platinum (II) four-coordinate complex described      above or a liposome of the present invention comprising a phospholipid and      a tumor cell-inhibiting effective amount of said platinum complex. The      administering step is preferably parenteral and by intravenous,      intraarterial, intramuscular, intralymphatic, intraperitoneal,      subcutaneous, intrapleural or intrathecal injection or by topical      application or oral dosage. Such administration is preferably repeated on      a timed schedule, for example twice daily for a period of two weeks. The      treatment may be maintained until tumor regression or disappearance has      been achieved and may be used in conjunction with other forms of tumor      therapy such as surgery or chemotherapy with different agents. </PAR><PAR>  These antitumor methods may also be used to inhibit the metastatic spread      of tumors such as reticulosarcoma. A preventative pretreatment with the      platinum(II) complexes or liposomes comprising those complexes may be used      to preclude metastatic spread in a vaccination-like manner. </PAR></BSUM><DETD> <PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </PAC><PAR>  Platinum (II) four-coordinate complexes were prepared utilizing racemic      (unresolved) DACH, trans-RR-DACH or trans-SS-DACH. It was found that      platinum complexes comprising trans-RR-DACH or trans-SS-DACH and two      hydrophobic ligands such as cyclopentene-carboxylato were more efficiently      incorporated into liposomes than were the analogous complexes comprising      racemic DACH. </PAR><PAR>  Liposomes incorporating these platinum complexes were found to be stable in      an aqueous milieu, non-nephrotoxic and active against murine leukemia      L-1210. </PAR><PAR>  In a general sense, the square-planar platinum (II) four coordinate      complexes of the present invention have the formula:      ##STR7##      where R.sub.1 and R.sub.2 are preferably carboxylato monoanions bearing a      hydrophobic radical function. R.sub.1 and R.sub.2 may also be a single      carboxylato dianion where the carboxylato groups are bound to an      interlinking atom which in turn is bound to a radical function.      Additionally, R.sub.3 is a vicinal diaminoalkane or vicinal      diaminocycloalkane. It is contemplated that R.sub.3 may be composed of two      independent alkylamines, cycloalkylamines or ammonia. These components      confer upon the complex a substantial solubility (normally greater than      about 5.0 mg/ml) in methanol or chloroform at ambient temperatures and a      substantial insolubility (less than about 0.5 mg/ml) in aqueous solutions      at ambient temperatures. </PAR><PAR>  The hydrophobic radical function, that function covalently pendant from the      carboxyl group or from an intermediate or linking group, may be an alkyl,      substituted aryl, aryl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl or cycloalkenyl group or even      combinations of these functions such as alkylaryl or arylalkenyl, to name      but two of the many possible hydrophobic combinations. The hydrophobic      radical function characteristically has between 5 and 20 carbon atoms.      When this hydrophobic radical function comprises an alkyl or alkenyl      group, this group may be straight or branched. Polar functions such as      hydroxyl groups, for example, substituted on the hydrophobic radicals      would tend to lessen their hydrophobicity and may render them less useful      for the purposes of the present invention. </PAR><PAR>  In certain cases the R.sub.1 and R.sub.2 functions may be interlinked, for      example when two acetate or propionate functions are bound together by a      nitrogen atom. In these cases the R.sub.1 and R.sub.2 functions are a      single carboxylato dianion. An alkyl hydrophobic function having between      six and twenty carbon atoms, such as n-decane, for example, may be bound      to the interlinking nitrogen and the resultant compound utilized in the      production of the platinum (II) four coordinate complex of the present      invention. </PAR><PAR>  With certain hydrophobic radical functions (cyclopentene, for example)      present on the carboxylato monoanion it was found that efficient      incorporation of PT complexes into phospholipid liposomes was dependent on      characteristics of the R.sub.3 function. For example, when R.sub.3 was 1,      2 diaminocyclohexane (DACH) the amino groups may be in several relative      stereochemical configurations, cis, trans-RR and trans-SS (a mixture of      these being termed &quot;racemic&quot;). With platinum (II) complexes containing      cyclopentene radical functions (R.sub.1 and R.sub.2) and various      stereochemical types of DACH it was found that the trans-RR-DACH and      trans-SS-DACH-complexes were more efficiently incorporated into      phospholipid liposomes (vesicles being a term equivalent to liposomes)      than were the analogous racemic DACH complexes. </PAR><PAR>  When a hydrophobic radical function was a branched alkyl containing nine      carbon atoms such as that in. neodecanoato, (C.sub.10 H.sub.20 O.sub.2,      empirical formula) the incorporation efficiency of a platinum (II) complex      comprising racemic DACH or trans-RR-DACH was maximal (100%). Thus, linear      or branched alkyl radical functions having from about 6 to about 12 carbon      atoms confer properties of efficient phospholipid liposome incorporation      upon any DACH-containing Pt (II) complex. </PAR><PAR>  Liposomes containing the platinum (II) complexes described herein may be      prepared from various amphipathic substances including natural or      synthetic phospholipids. The phospholipids usable to produce liposomes are      numerous and not exhaustively listed herein since they are generally well      known in the art. These phospholipids include but are not limited to:      lecithin, phosphatidylethanolamine, lysolecithin,      lysophatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol,      sphingomyelin, cardiolipin, phosphatidic acid and the cerebrosides. Most      preferable phospholipids for the practice of aspects of the present      invention include dimyristoylphosphatidylglycerol (DMPG) and      dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC). Cholesterol in minor proportions      ranging from less than 1% to about 50% may be included with phospholipids      and platinum (II) complexes to produce liposomes of the present invention.      A preferable but not limiting combination of DMPG and DMPC has been found      to be a ratio of 3 to 7 although ratios between 1:10 and 10:1 are      contemplated as satisfactory. Ratios of platinum (II) complex to      phospholipid between about 1 to 10 and about 1 to 30 are contemplated as      generally satisfactory although a 1 to 15 ratio was primarily used in      studies thus far. </PAR><PAR>  Either unilamellar or multilamellar or other platinum (II)      complex--containing liposomes may be used in the practice of the present      invention. Multilamellar liposomes are presently preferred since the      platinum (II) complexes of the present invention are substantially      water-insoluble and they appear to be incorporated into the phospholipid      bilayers of the liposome lamellae. </PAR><PAR>  Generally, the procedure for synthesis of the platinum II compounds of the      present invention may be described on one scale as follows: (1) about 10      mmole vicinal diamino cycloalkane or alkane are added to 50 ml aqueous      solution of K.sub.2 Pt Cl.sub.4 (3.5 g) and stirred for six to eight hours      at room temperature. The yellow solid formed comprising      cis-bis-dichloro-1,2-diamine-Pt(II) may be removed by filtration and      washed with fluids such as water, methanol or acetone. The solid may then      be suspended in about 20 ml H.sub.2 O and an aqueous solution containing      about 0.75 g Ag.sub.2 SO.sub.4 added thereto. After stirring for about 24      hours in the dark, precipitated Ag Cl may be removed by filtration. The      sulfato-vicinal diamine-Pt may then be dissolved in about 100 ml H.sub.2 O      and added to about 2 m mol of alkali earth metal salt of a carboxylato      anion prepared in situ, and stirred therewith for about 30 minutes. After      removal of BaSO.sub.4 by filtration, the platinum II complex of the      present invention may be obtained, for example by crystallization or      removal of the solvent by evaporation. </PAR><PAR>  The methods of preparation of particular platinum (II) complexes and      chemotherapeutic treatment with particular platinum (II) complexes      described in the Examples contained later herein are readily adapted to      the production and use of analogously described and claimed complexes by      simple substitutions of appropriate vicinal diamines or hydrophobic      radical-containing carboxylato monoanions. </PAR><PAR>  Liposomes comprising phospholipids and platinum complexes (Pt-liposomes) of      the present invention are useful in inhibiting both the growth and      metastatic spread of tumors. </PAR><PAR>  Such Pt-liposomes may be administered parenterally, topically or orally.      Oral or parenteral dosages of these Pt-liposomes between about 2.5 mg/kg      body weight and 25 mg/kg body weight are contemplated as adequate in most      conditions. The particular dosages, if a tumor-bearing human is being      treated may vary in each case according to the condition of the patient,      the type and extent of tumor, and particular Pt-liposome toxicity. </PAR><PAR>  The amount of liposomal-platinum included in the pharmaceutical composition      and the dosage utilized in the method of treatment of the invention will      vary depending in each case upon the conditions of the patients, the      nature of the tumor undergoing treatment, antitumor activity of      liposomal-platinum, the toxicity and solubility characteristics thereof,      etc. Liposomal-platinum may also be administered in combination with other      antitumor agents in a combined therapeutic regimen. </PAR><PAR>  Parenteral administration may be intraperitoneal, subcutaneous,      intrapleural, intrathecal, intraurethral, intravenous, intraarterial,      intramuscular or intralymphatic. Such parenteral administration preferably      involves Pt-liposome suspensions in pharmaceutically acceptable solutions      such as sterile isotonic aqueous solutions. These suspensions may be      obtained fully prepared or may be prepared from preformed components. As      known to those skilled in the art, Pt-liposomes may be prepared as pellets      or powders. These pellets or powders may be mixed with pharmaceutically      acceptable solutions to form suspensions for parenteral administration. </PAR><PAR>  Topical administration of Pt-liposomes may involve pharmaceutical      compositions such as suspensions, creams or ointments which may be      obtained fully prepared or prepared from Pt-liposome powders or pellets.      Such topical administration may be near to sites of cancerous lesions such      as the epithelium or mucosa for example. </PAR><PAR>  Oral administrations of Pt-liposomes preferably involve encapsulation of      Pt-liposome powder or pellets whereby the Pt-liposomes are protected from      much gastric and intestinal digestive activity before release from the      encapsulation. </PAR><PAR>  When desired, Pt-liposomes may be prepared to contain, for example, other      therapeutic agents for treatment of tumors or anti-oxidants to aid in      liposome stabilization. </PAR><PAR>  Use of the complexes of the present invention, particularly as a component      of liposomes, focuses upon the inhibition of tumor growth and prevention      of the metastatic spread of tumors. For example, first a host is      identified as bearing a tumor type known to generally contain cells whose      growth is often inhibited by platinum (II) complexes. Tumor growth in the      host may be inhibited by administering to the host the PT-containing      liposomes of the present invention. </PAR><PAR>  Similarly, the metastatic spread of tumors in a host may be inhibited. A      host bearing metastatic or potentially metastatic tumors of a type noted      often to be sensitive to platinum (II) complexes, would first be      identified. The administration of the PT-containing liposomes of the      present invention to that host would serve to inhibit metastatic spread. </PAR><PAR>  The following examples are presented to further illustrate preferred      embodiments of the present invention; they are not intended to limit the      invention unless otherwise so stated in the accompanying claims. </PAR><PAC>  EXAMPLE 1 </PAC><PAC>  Materials and Analyses </PAC><PAR>  K.sub.2 PtCl.sub.4 was purchased from AESAR (Johnson Matthey, Inc.

BDF.sub.1 mice were purchased from      Charles River (Wilmington, Mass.). Groups of 6-8 mice weighing 18-22 gm      were inoculated ip with 1.times.10.sup.6 L1210 leukemia cells on day 0.      L1210 cells were kept in DBA.sub.2 mice were weekly passages between the      different experiments. All L-PT preparations were injected ip in volumes      of 0.1 to 0.3 ml 24 hours after tumor inoculation. Two different schedules      of administration were used: a single injection on day 1 or an injection      on days 1, 5 and 9 (multiple). The doses of CDDP used were the ones that      had resulted in a maximum antitumor activity in previous experiments. The      doses of PT, DMPG-PT and DMPC:DMPG 7:3-PT used ranged from 3.125 mg/kg to      50 mg/kg (approximate LD.sub.10). Clinical behavior and survival times      were monitored until all animals had died. Results were expressed as % T/C      (median survival time of treated mice/median survival time of control      mice.times.100) and number of long-term survivors. Mice living more than      30 days and more than 60 days were considered to be long-term survivors      for the single and multiple injection schedule respectively. All L-PT      preparations tested for antitumor activity were prepared under sterile      conditions on the same day of the experiment. In the first set of      experiments, the effect of a single ip dose of CDDP, free PT, DMPG-PT and      DMPC:DMPG 7:3-PT in the treatment of L1210 leukemia was tested. Mice      treated with free PT at doses of 12.5 mg/kg and 25 mg/kg had a % T/C      comparable to those treated with 10 mg/kg of CDDP (162 vs 178, means of      three experiments) (Table 6). DMPG-PT at doses of 12.5 mg/kg, 6.25 mg/kg      and 3.125 mg/kg had an antitumor activity comparable to free PT and CDDP      (mean % T/Candequals;175 for 12.5 mg/kg; 158 for 6.25 mg/kg; and 163 for 3.125      mg/kg) (Table 6). Doses of DMPG-PT of 25 mg/kg or more were toxic for      L1210 leukemia-bearing BDF.sub.1 mice. Mice treated with DMPC:DMPG 7:3-PT      at doses of 25 mg/kg, 12.5 mg/kg and 6.25 mg/kg had a similar or slightly      higher T/C than those obtained with CDDP, free PT and DMPG-PT (mean: %      T/Candequals;215 for 25 mg/kg; 178 for 12.5 mg/kg; and 200 for 6.25 mg/kg) (Table      6). DMPC:DMPG 7:3-PT at a dose of 50 mg/kg was toxic for L1210      leukemia-bearing BDF.sub.1 mice. Empty liposomes composed of DMPG and      DMPC:DMPG 7:3, at doses equivalent to the optimal ones of loaded vesicles      (L-PT) did not shown antitumor activity (% T/Candequals;105 for DMPG and 93 for      DMPC:DMPG 7:3).
