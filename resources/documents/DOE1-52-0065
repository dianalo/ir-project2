This integration is made possibleby the IGP's unique user interface and networking software. Prototypesystems of the table-driven, interpreter-based IGP have been adaptedto very different programmatic requirements and have demonstrated substantialincreases in end-user productivity. Procedures previously requiring dayscan now be carried out in minutes. The IGP software has been under developmentby the Technology Information Systems (TIS) program at Lawrence LivermoreNational Laboratory (LLNL) since 1975 and has been in use by severalfederal agencies since 1983. The Air Force is prototyping applicationswhich range from automated identification of spare parts for aircraftto office automation and the controlled storage and distribution of technicalorders and engineering drawings. Other applications of the IGP are theInformation Management System (IMS) for aviation statistics in the FederalAviation Administration (FAA), the Nuclear Criticality Information System(NCIS) and a nationwide Cost Estimating System (CES) in the Departmentof Energy, the library automation network of the Defense Technical InformationCenter (DTIC), and the modernization program in the Office of the Secretaryof Defense (OSD). 31 references.</TEXT></DOC>
