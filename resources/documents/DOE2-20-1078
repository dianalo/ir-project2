The main objective for thisarea is to achieve an installed power of 20 MW in 1988 and 60 MW in 1992,stabilizing actions on the WECS supply and demand. The R andamp; D andamp; D activitiesin the wind energy field are mainly the following: (1) wind resourceassessment - focused in high potential areas through intensive measuringcampaigns and site selection; (2) development of technology - technicalsupport to manufacturers in small and medium size WECS, and internationalcooperation projects in large WECS; (3) wind energy applications - windfarms, wind-diesel systems, water pumping and water desalination projects;(4) performance and testing - experimental wind energy plant at Tarifa(100 KW) and test plant for small WECS in Alfabia and blade fatigue testplant; (5) international cooperation - participation in the R andamp; D WECSand in LS WECS IEA Programs and several projects supported by the CECProgram (DG XII and DG SVII). The scope and content of these programsare outlined below.</TEXT></DOC>
