A NatWest spokesman said the bank told branch managers notto impose margins more than 6.5 percentage points above thebase rate on floating-rate loans to small businesses.</LP><TEXT>   Bank lending policies have been the subject of a growingcontroversy in Britain. Since October, U.K. banks' base rateshave fallen to 11.5% from 15%. While lending rates havefallen too, there have been complaints that the cuts haven'tcome fast enough.   U.K. banks admit they have raised the interest-ratemargins charged on some loans, particularly to customersregarded as an increased credit risk, as part of a drive torestore profits hurt by losses on bad loans. The banks saysuch practices are simply a question of good housekeeping andin no way reflect anything resembling a cartel. But withpoliticians gearing up for parliamentary elections within thenext 12 months, the row has acquired strong politicalovertones.   A NatWest spokesman said the rate ceiling was beingimposed &quot;in the context of the current controversy&quot; oversmall business borrowing costs.   In Brussels, meanwhile, EC Competition Commissioner SirLeon Brittan announced plans to question national bankingassociations about the way lending rates are set so as todetermine whether a lack of competition is raising the costof borrowing.   The EC commission plans to send formal letters to bankingassociations in all 12 member states ordering them to provideinformation on any interbank agreements setting interestrates. The banking groups will have four weeks to respond.   &quot;Every business and individual in the community has aright to a genuinely competitive service from the community'sbanking sector, and I shall make sure that they get it,&quot; SirLeon said. The timing of Sir Leon's move clearly draws itsinspiration from the British controversy, though EC officialsnote that he first wrote to banks in 1989 warning them thatthere was &quot;no justification for interbank agreements oninterest rates.&quot;   NatWest's move to set a maximum margin on lending rateswas the first commercial response to the controversy. Ithasn't been followed by other leading banks.   NatWest's ceiling will affect only a few customers, suchas start-up ventures considered particularly risky. But it issignificant because it marks a breach with NatWest's policyof letting managers decide maximum rates.   European bankers, meanwhile, denied that there are anyagreements on interest rates. &quot;I am sure there are noagreements between banks. What you do see is a convergence ofinterest rates because no one bank can afford to be too outof line,&quot; said Nikolaus Boemcke, deputy general secretary ofthe EC Banking Federation.   He said the convergence of rates is often due to strongpressure from some national monetary authorities on banks torespond quickly to changes in base, or discount, rates.   Earlier this week, Prime Minister John Major voiced hisconcern in Parliament about the British lending controversy.And on Tuesday, Chancellor of the Exchequer Norman Lamontsummoned Britain's top bankers to individual meetings todiscuss the issue.   To some analysts, the government's move smacked ofpolitical posturing. &quot;Clearly, it's heavily influenced by thepolitical season we are in,&quot; said Richard O'Brien, chiefeconomist at American Express Bank Ltd. But the row overinterest rates may also be symptomatic of a more far-reachingproblem concerning the availability of credit to small andmedium-sized businesses, Mr. O'Brien said.   In the late 1980s, he said, U.K. banks were so eager tolend that they cut margins to lure away each others' clients.Now, both banks and customers are suffering from the effectsof those policies as well as attempts to rectify them.   A spokeswoman for the British Bankers' Associationwelcomed Sir Leon's initiative. &quot;There is no cartel,&quot; shesaid. &quot;All that an inquiry will show is that there's nocollusion between banks.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
