According to a new study by Eno Foundation for Transportation Inc. in Westport, Conn., 12.7 million people commute from a suburb to a central city each day. But almost twice that number -- 25 million -- commute from one suburb to another.    Around major metropolitan areas, suburb-to-suburb trips are now the dominant commuting pattern, the study shows. In areas where the central city has a population of 250,000 or less, most commuters still travel from the suburbs to the center of town.    As more companies turn to outdoor advertising because of its lower costs, the need for information about commuter patterns is increasing. If billboards are purchased in areas that catch the eye of only suburb-to-city commuters, for example, an advertiser may miss a whole commuting segment.    Currently, the primary statistic available to most companies that advertise outdoors is the number of daily &quot;showings&quot;: the number of people who pass a billboard or poster. Soon, however, outdoor advertisers may demand the same type of demographic data that television, magazines and newspapers provide about the types of people who view their messages.    Aging Diners   The aging baby-boom generation may prompt the restaurant industry to change its menus and marketing strategies.    A new report by the Food Institute, based in Fair Lawn, N.J., projects that, between 1990 and 1995, people aged 35 to 54 will spend $13 billion more on food away from home than the same age group is projected to spend from 1985 to 1990. Conversely, those aged 34 and younger will spend about $1.5 billion less on food away from home between 1990 and 1995 than their counterparts are spending now.    (For food purchased for the home, the 35-to-54 age group is expected to spend $24 billion more between 1990 and 1995 than the same age group is spending now; those age 34 and younger are expected to spend about $5 billion less.)    The changes in food purchases away from home may spur many restaurants, particularly the fast-food industry, to focus on foods and marketing themes that are more attractive to middle-age people. Fewer individuals age 35 to 54 will have small children that are attracted by video games, cartoons and meals in a box.    Growing Counties   As the U.S. population continues its westward tilt, some counties in that region are experiencing explosive growth.    Far and away the biggest change has occurred in Los Angeles County, Calif. Between 1980 and 1986, the county's population rose to 8.3 million from 7.5 million. The gain of 818,700 people is more than double that of any other county in the U.S. And the increase alone exceeds the total population of all but 40 of the nation's 3,138 counties.    In the same period, Maricopa County, Ariz. -- home to Phoenix -- registered the second biggest population gain. An increase of 391,000 citizens brought its total population to 1.9 million. Of the 10 counties with the largest increases in population between 1980 and 1986, all the rest are in California and Texas.    Smokestack cities continue to shrink. Leading the list of population losers are the home counties of Detroit (Wayne County, Mich.); Pittsburgh (Allegheny County, Pa.); Cleveland (Cuyahoga County, Ohio); and Buffalo (Erie County, N.Y.). Wayne County's 1986 population of 2,164,300 represents a loss of 173,500 residents since 1980.    The 25 counties that lost the most people between 1980 and 1986 include six in Pennsylvania, four in Ohio, three in Michigan, and two in New York.    Shopping on TV   About 60% of U.S. households have access to a home-shopping program on their televisions. But only 11% watch two or more times a week, according to a survey by the Newspaper Advertising Bureau.    People in the Northeast, the South and non-metropolitan areas are slightly more likely to be frequent viewers of home-shopping programs, the survey shows. Those with fewer years of education are also more likely to tune in; people who haven't completed high school watch home-shopping programs at nearly four times the rate of those with college degrees.    Ironically, the age group that is most likely to watch home-shopping telecasts -- those 65 and older -- has less access to such programming than most age groups. </TEXT></DOC>
