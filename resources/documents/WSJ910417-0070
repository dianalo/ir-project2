Mr. Bush's announcement represents a significantescalation of the U.S. effort to aid and protect Kurdishrefugees. The action means that allied forces intend toignore Iraqi borders and take direct control of reliefefforts. Mr. Bush said that U.S. troops will be aided byFrench and British forces, and perhaps soldiers from othercountries, in setting up and guarding five or six camps onnon-mountainous terrain in northern Iraq.</LP><TEXT>   The president insisted, though, that the direct militaryinvolvement inside Iraq doesn't represent any change in hisinsistence that the U.S. won't get involved in Iraqi civilwar. Rather, Mr. Bush asserted that Iraqi troops aren'tlikely to confront allied forces over the camps and said hehopes operation of the outposts can soon be turned over tothe United Nations.   &quot;All along, I have said that the United States is notgoing to intervene militarily in Iraq's internal affairs andrisk being drawn into a Vietnam-style quagmire,&quot; Mr. Bushsaid at an early-evening news conference. &quot;This remains thecase. Nor will we become an occupying power with U.S. troopspatrolling the streets of Baghdad.&quot;   Mr. Bush's move, made after daylong consultations with theleaders of France, Britain, Germany, Turkey and the U.N., isanother attempt by the administration to devise a formula forprotecting Iraqi foes of the government of Saddam Husseinwithout becoming directly involved in the internal fighting.The administration has struggled in vain for weeks to find away of both protecting those who heeded American calls torise up against Saddam Hussein and extracting most U.S.forces from the region as quickly as possible.   Mr. Bush, who has appeared defensive about his policytoward the turmoil in Iraq in recent appearances, yesterdaywas somber and reserved as he discussed the problems thathave emerged in the wake of the Gulf war. In responding tocriticism of his administration's handling of the problems,he acknowledged being surprised by the size of the Kurdishrefugee problem, but insisted that the U.S. doesn't &quot;bearguilt&quot; for misleading Kurdish rebels into thinking they wouldget American military support.   The president said only a &quot;relatively small&quot; number ofU.S. troops will be needed to establish the camps insideIraq. Figures released by the White House indicate thatalmost 8,000 Americans, most of them military personnel,already are involved in relief efforts along the Iraq-Turkeyborder, but the figures don't estimate how much that numberwill grow.   By devising a plan to keep the refugees inside Iraq, Mr.Bush and other allied leaders appear to be trying to meet theneeds of Turkish President Turgut Ozal.   Mr. Ozal, who was a valued participant in theinternational coalition opposing Iraq's invasion of Kuwait,has been worried that Saddam Hussein was taking advantage ofthe postwar turmoil to solve his problems with Kurds bysimply driving them across the border into Turkey. Turkeyalready is home to millions of Kurds who yearn to establish aKurdish homeland, and Mr. Ozal doesn't want hundreds ofthousands of additional Kurds from Iraq taking up residencein his country.   As a result, the allies have settled on a plan under whichIraq is simply being advised that it will have to accept thatareas of its territory are being controlled by foreignsoldiers. Mr. Bush said Iraq will be expected to keep itsplanes and helicopters out of the area north of the 36thparallel, which cuts through northern Iraq. U.S. warplaneswill patrol Iraqi skies to enforce that warning, he said.   The plan in many ways resembles a vague idea, advancedearlier by British Prime Minister John Major, to establishwhat he called internationally controlled &quot;enclaves&quot; innorthern Iraq to protect and house refugees. The Bushadministration shied away from that idea, fearing that theconcept of enclaves could open the way to a destabilizingdismemberment of Iraq.   Mr. Bush's new plan doesn't directly aid two other groupsof refugees fearful of the wrath of their own government:Kurds who have fled to Iraq's border with Iraq and Shiiteswho have been protected by U.S. forces in southern Iraq. Mr.Bush said he was confident that the Shiites in the southwould be adequately protected by U.N. military observersmoving into the border region between Iraq and Kuwait. And hesaid the U.S. is willing to help Iran care for refugees it isreceiving, by sending aid through internationalorganizations.</TEXT></DOC>
