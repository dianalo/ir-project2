(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The parents of five people killed whena bomb exploded aboard a Pan Am flight over Scotland are demandingthat the U.S. government investigate the bombing.   ``There is an enormous amount of anger and outrage at the waywe've been treated by this country's government,'' said BarbaraPrimeau of Greenwich, N.Y., mother of 20-year-old twins, Jason andEric Coker, who were among the 270 people killed in the Dec. 21crash of Flight 103 in Lockerbie, Scotland.   Ms. Primeau joined two families of victims from upstate New Yorkand another family from North Adams at a news conference on Friday.   The petition drive was launched in this northwest Massachusettscity because residents have shown concern at the slow progress ofthe crash investigation, the families said.   ``Terrorism and tragedy such as this have never touched thiscommunity before,'' said Mayor John Barrett III, the first to signthe petition.   The drive was organized by Joyce Wrend, who was among the 1,000mourners at the church service for Wendy Lincoln, a SyracuseUniversity student on her way home from London for Christmas whenthe plane blew up.   ``I'd like to see an outcry from the people so loud that thegovernment can't forget this,'' said Charles Lincoln in his firststatement since the death of his 23-year-old daughter.   The petitions will be distributed throughout the Northeast.Organizers said they hope to get 20,000 signatures by the time theystage a vigil outside the White House on April 3.   Ms. Primeau and other family members said they suspect the StateDepartment knew about the bomb threats but that it remained on thesidelines before and after the crash.   ``We're not an investigatory agency,'' Francis Jones, spokeswomanfor the State Department's Office of Consular Affairs in Washington,said Friday. ``British authorities are investigating the crash andthe FBI is assisting them.''   ``The investigation is a very lengthy, complicated process. Andit's frustrating, which is very difficult for the families. It'sunderstandable,'' she added. ``I wish there was something we coulddo to make things come together more quickly.''   Ms. Primeau said the anger of the families was heightened Fridayby a British newspaper report that authorities knew who had bombedthe flight. The report from the Times of London, dismissed byinvestigators, has increased their suspicion that the U.S.government is withholding information about the bombing, she said.   Pan Am confirmed it had been warned by the West German governmentNov. 10 about the kind of radio-cassette player bomb involved.   Politicians of the opposition Labor Party in London accusedTransport Secretary Paul Channon with bungling a warning dated twodays before the disaster but not mailed until several days later.</TEXT></DOC>
