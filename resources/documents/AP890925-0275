ROSENBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   RJR Nabisco Inc. said Monday it had made thelast major asset sale under a $5.5 billion divestiture plan as aninvestor group led by Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. agreed to buy its DelMonte canned food business for $1.48 billion.   Del Monte's senior management, Citicorp Capital Investors Ltd.and Kikkoman Corp. also are members of the investor group.   RJR Nabisco said proceeds from the sale will bring toapproximately $4.9 billion the amount of money it has earned fromits divestiture program.   The company began selling assets to reduce its debt followingthe record $24.53 billion buyout of the food and tobacco giant byKohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. earlier this year.   Sarah Sheckler, who analyzes RJR Nabisco for Duff andamp; Phelps Inc.in Chicago, said the asset sales are ``proceeding well'' and thatthe prices RJR Nabisco has received were generally in line withexpectations.   The company previously announced the sale of five European foodbusinesses for $2.5 billion; its Chun King food division for $52million; its Associated Biscuits International Ltd. for $44million; and the fresh fruit operations of Del Monte for $875million.   ``We don't anticipate that there will be any more majordivestitures,'' RJR Nabisco spokesman David Kalis said Monday.   RJR Nabisco management would look at the company's businessesindividually and decide where it could make further cuts, Kalissaid.   Ms. Sheckler said she expected RJR Nabisco to sell individualgrocery product lines to achieve its goal of $5.5 billion.   There had been speculation that RJR Nabisco might sell itsPlanters LifeSavers Co., but the company apparently plans to retainthe division.   RJR Nabisco had been expected to sell Del Monte's canned foodbusiness to a group led by Citicorp Venture Capital. However, thecompany was forced to revamp the deal after the Federal ReserveBoard's staff expressed concern that the transaction did not complywith regulations limiting banks' ownership of nonfinancialcompanies.   Citicorp was forced to reduce its stake in the Del Monteholdings because federal banking rules prohibit banks from owningmore than 5 percent of voting stock and 25 percnet of non-votingstock in non-financial firms.   Businesses included in the latest sale included Del Monte FoodsUSA, Del Monte Foods Europe, Del Monte's processed food business inMexico, the Caribbean and the Far East and its pineapple operationsin the Philippines and Kenya.   RJR Nabisco said it would keep Del Monte-Aylmer Canada, DelMonte's processed food business in Venezuela, and Nabisco foodbusinesses in Latin America that had been managed by Del Monte.</TEXT></DOC>
