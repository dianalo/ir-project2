The 420-page report urged movement on the controversial issue ofglobal warming, on which some in the administration have citeddiffering scientific opinions and shown reluctance to accept direpredictions regarding the so-called greenhouse effect.   The report, put together over a two-year period and forwarded toCongress late Friday, states that the government might find itnecessary to plan ``future projects considering climate change evenbefore all the uncertainties are known.''   Bush said significant strides have been made by the federal andlocal governments as well as the private sector ``to addresspollution and environmental degradation'' with such steps as autoemissions standards.   ``But we can do better,'' he wrote in a message to Congress.``That is why we are committed to cleaner air in the nation'scities,'' he said, noting that he has proposed a clean air packageto deal with acid rain, airborne toxics and auto-produced smog.   In addition, he said, ``This country must make every effort tostem the rising tide of garbage and industrial waste through a moreaggressive use of waste minimization and recycling practices.''   Bush said recycling should start with separation of garbage inhomes and in local communities.   The report, an assessment of the nation's environmental statusfor the years 1987-88 drawn from a variety of agency and militarystudies and scientific reports, makes clear the Bush administrationwill not assume the full burden of environmental protection. Itcalls on state and local governments as well as business to sharethe responsibility.   For instance, more than half the nation's municipal landfills``make no attempt to control water pollution resulting from therunoff of rain water from their sites,'' the report says. ``Lessthan half impose restrictions on receipt of bulk liquid wastes.These and other practices suggest that a large portion of landfilledmunicipal solid waste ends up in places where it might contaminateground water.''   It notes further that the country has thousands of old dumpingsites in the middle of residential areas, and that the federalgovernment's Superfund cleanup program will share responsibility foronly a handful of them.   Regarding the nation's infrastructure, the report says suchfacilities as navigation channels and ports, flood control works,mass transit systems, water supply, wastewater and solid wastefacilities are ``barely adequate to fulfill current requirements andinsufficient to meet the demands of future economic growth anddevelopment.''   Given the experience of the 1988 drought, in which extensivedredging and water control management was required to keep inlandwaterways open for commerce, the report notes that ``formal, planneddrought management has not been a major federal focus,'' and that itwill be an important water resources issue in the future.   The report takes a cautious approach to the greenhouse effect, inwhich carbon dioxide and other gases in the earth's atmosphere trapradiant heat near the planet's surface. In addition to naturalbuildup, the gases have increased dramatically because of burningcoal, oil, and gas, as well as the destruction of tropical rainforests.   In light of the massive economic upheaval that would be caused ifthe government found it necessary to declare war on the greenhouseeffect, the administration has taken the position that evidence isinconclusive on whether the trend is as serious as some analystshave found.   Noting the disagreements, the CEQ report says the scientificevidence is ``evolving'' on the extend of global warming and itspotential impact on weather patterns.   ``It may be necessary, however, to plan future projectsconsidering climate change even before all the uncertainties areknown,'' the report said. ``In the interim, support of necessary newresearch and thorough evaluation of ongoing and completed researchis needed.''   The three-member Council on Environmental Quality was establishedin 1970 to advise the president on environmental matters and has fewstatutory powers. One of President Reagan's first acts was to slashits staff, and the council did little during his presidency.   Bush so far has not shown an inclination to raise the council'sprofile. However, environmentalists were heartened when thepresident tapped Michael R. Deland, to be its new chairman. He wasthe Boston area administrator for the Environmental ProtectionAgency and is known as a strong environmentalist.</TEXT></DOC>
