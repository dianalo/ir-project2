Officials from South Africa, Angola, Cuba and the United Statesmet privately at the U.S. Coast Guard base on Governors Island inNew York harbor on a way to send home all foreign troops insouthern Africa.   South Africa has said it would accept a U.N. Security Councilresolution calling for the independence of South-West Africa, alsoknown as Namibia, when Cuban troops leave Marxist-ruled Angola. TheCubans are fighting rebels supported by the United States and SouthAfrica.   This round of talks is expected to end late Tuesday or earlyWednesday, said Anne Stoddard, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Missionto the United Nations. Disagreement over a timetable for Cubanwithdrawal appears to be the most difficult unresolved issue.   The U.S. goal is a complete pullout in one year, the same periodthe U.N. resolution on Namibian independence allows South Africa togive up control of that territory.   Angola and Cuba have insisted the Cuban withdrawal be spreadover four years, but U.S. officials believe that is only abargaining position.   Namibia lies between Angola and South Africa. South Africacaptured it from Germany in World War I and governed it under aLeague of Nations mandate abrogated by the United Nations more than20 years ago.   In 1971, the World Court declared South Africa's continued ruleover Namibia illegal but the court, a branch of the United Nations,has no enforcement power.   The United States is a party to these talks because of thesupport it has given Angolan guerrillas since 1985. Civil war hasplagued Angola since it became independent of Portugal in 1975.   South Africa has repeatedly sent troops across the border fromNamibia into Angola to help the guerrillas and pursue guerrillasfrom South-West Africa, and in recent weeks have fought Cuban andAngolan forces in southwest Angola.   Cuba has increased its troop strength there from about 37,000soldiers last fall to an estimated 50,000, U.S. officials inWashington say, but add they believe the buildup is an attempt tostrengthen its bargaining position.   The U.S. officials say privately they are Angola's recentacceptance of the principle of a total Cuban troop withdrawal.   They also say the Soviet Union, which has provided Angolabillions of dollars worth of military equipment since 1975, hasshown interest in ending the conflict through a negotiatedsettlement.   The four parties first met in London in early May, thenreconvened late last month in Cairo, Egypt. South African andAngolan officials held a separate meeting in May in Brazzaville,Congo.</TEXT></DOC>
