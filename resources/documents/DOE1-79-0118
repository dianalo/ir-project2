When coils are designedto arch of themselves over a small beam pipe, it simplifies the magnetconstruction both in the winding procedure and in the field quality control.Fabrication of these coils requires cables with large keystone angles.A new structure of braid-in-strands is devised to make these cables.A design study is performed to make clear the characteristics of themagnets that are wound by these cables. A magnet is designed in thisstudy and the straight section of this magnet has been fabricated asa preliminary test before constructing a whole magnet.</TEXT></DOC>
