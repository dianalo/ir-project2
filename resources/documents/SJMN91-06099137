LloydBentsen of Texas. Critics include House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt.;   &quot;I'm going to approach this strictly in a non-partisan, non-political manner.It is too important to get it bogged down in partisan politics,&quot; said Bush.;   Bush made his pitch the day after vowing with Mexican President CarlosSalinas de Gortari to fight hard for the agreement and resolving to go&quot;head-on-head&quot; against the AFL-CIO, which fears an erosion of jobs to south ofthe border.;    He also praised Salinas today, saying, &quot;He's doing afirst-class job.
