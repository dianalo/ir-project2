In the light of our very recent experience with a dictatorship, the Constitutional Commission found it necessary to include substantive provisions that address the pressing problems of social, economic and political inequalities and cultural inequities that are unique to the Philippines. There are new provisions that deal primarily with social justice, the national economy, family rights, education and human resources, the Commission on Human Rights and autonomous regions. While it is true that a constitution must be brief, we should not sacrifice a true and accurate expression of the aspirations of the people for the sake of brevity.    You cite Section 12 of Article 12 as an example of &quot;statist&quot; policy. Please note that the promotion of the &quot;preferential use of Filipino labor, domestic materials and locally produced goods&quot; is qualified and balanced by the requirement of government to &quot;adopt measures that help make them competitive.&quot; The key word is &quot;competitive,&quot; which negates the unnecessary use of tariffs, licenses and subsidies. You also decry the fact that the constitution recognizes the right of labor to security of tenure. But you fail to mention that this is to be obtained within the framework of collective bargaining and negotiations.    After our recent sad experience with monopolies and government controls we are firmly moving toward the restoration of free enterprise.    The &quot;nuclear-free&quot; provision is not, as you call it, an &quot;ostrich&quot; policy. As made clear by the commission in a resolution, the phrase &quot;consistent with the national interest&quot; qualifies the prohibition. The draft constitution does not then preclude allowing or use of nuclear weapons when reality -- the national interest -- so demands.    There are many provisions that may have to be clarified in subsequent legislation or court rulings. But this &quot;deficiency&quot; helps, as it does with the U.S. Constitution, to make the new draft constitution flexible with the needs of the time. On the whole, it is neither its clarity nor brevity nor length that will make a constitution serve its purpose. It is really whether it is reflective of a people's aspirations and collective wisdom on how they wish to be governed.    Francisco E.
