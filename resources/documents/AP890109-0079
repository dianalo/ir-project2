I therefore propose that two new federal wild land firefightingaccounts be established in the departments of agriculture andinterior.   _To further strengthen our energy security, I propose legislationauthorizing the sale of the naval petroleum reserves to the privatesector in exchange for cash and oil to be added to the strategicpetroleum reserve.   I also propose the establishment of a separate 10 million barreldefense petroleum inventory.   _To provide for the timely completion of my Reform '88 managementimprovement program I propose an additional $103 million for 1990,to further improve our management and credit systems.</TEXT><HEAD>MAJOR PROGRAMS ARE REFORMED TO ACHIEVE DEFICIT REDUCTION</HEAD><TEXT>   The program structure and incentives underlying many domesticfederal programs need to be altered to promote greater efficiencyand cost-effectiveness.   _Current farm price support programs are far too costly.   For the period 1986-89 an estimated $130 billion in federalspending for farm-related assistance programs provided an average ofnearly $600,000 per farmer.   Much of this assistance goes to farmers with high incomes _ morethan twice the U.S. family average.   I therefore propose outlay reductions for the price and incomesupport programs of $2 billion in 1990 and additional annualreductions of between $2 and $2.5 billion in each year from 1991through 1994.   In addition, I urge reform of the counterproductive sugar pricesupport program.   _The rapidly rising costs of the Medicare program need to bemoderated.   I propose a reasonable increase in the Medicare prospectivepayment system rate and reductions in hospital capital payments andspecial graduate medical education payments.   Also, in an effort to restrain excessive growth in supplementarymedical insurance (SMI) costs, I propose extension of the currentlaw SMI premiums, limitations on physican payments, reductions inpayments for certain overpriced procedures, and reforms in thedurable medical equipment payment system.   Medicare spending would still grow by 9 percent between 1989 and1990 under these proposals _ but not by the 13 percent that wouldoccur under current law.</TEXT><HEAD>MORE</HEAD><TEXT/></DOC>
