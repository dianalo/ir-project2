In the three weeks since then, Mr. Bush has succeeded insecuring the oil fields, and in gathering an impressive showof international condemnation for Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.</LP><TEXT>   But now the president is running into real problemsarticulating and selling the administration's broader goalsin the Gulf crisis -- goals such as the restoration of theemir of Kuwait, an objective that will be tough to achieveand difficult to sell to Americans unaccustomed to fightingfor unelected monarchies.   &quot;I think the president has been better with deeds thanwith plans or words, at least as they're expressed,&quot; saysSen. Frank Lautenberg (D., N.J.). &quot;I don't know what themission is fully expected to be.&quot;   Whereas oil once seemed the overriding Americanconsideration, Mr. Bush recently gave a 25-minute speechabout the Gulf crisis to the Veterans of Foreign Wars withoutonce mentioning the word &quot;oil.&quot; He stressed instead moreidealistic goals such as stopping Iraq's &quot;assault on the veryessence of international order and civilized ideals.&quot;   Mr. Bush has often compared Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein toAdolf Hitler -- yet in a meeting with lawmakers this week hedidn't say that removing him was an American goal. Privately,other officials worry that whoever follows Saddam Husseinmight be even worse.   And the president has made little of what some analystsand politicians think may be the most powerful argument forchallenging Saddam Hussein: The likelihood that this crisiscould set the tone for the whole international order in thepost-Cold War period.   &quot;I think that they have done quite well in saying SaudiArabia asked us to come and we went and this was all part ofa collective effort,&quot; says William Quandt, a Carteradministration Middle East adviser now at the BrookingsInstitution. &quot;Where I think they have been a little morecareless is in not having made enough of a point, which Ithink people understand pretty readily, that . . . in thiscrisis, we have the chance for laying down the ground rulesfor some time ahead.&quot;   The administration's difficulty in articulating a clear,long-term mission in the Gulf seems to arise because thepresident and his aides aren't sure how aggressive they wantto be. In a radio address to armed forces yesterday, as inall his prepared remarks since the crisis began, Mr. Bushtalked of four goals: forcing an Iraqi withdrawal fromKuwait, restoring the Kuwaiti government, ensuring thestability of the Persian Gulf and protecting Americansabroad.   There was a flurry of reports yesterday that theadministration had turned down feelers from Iraq onnegotiations. In fact, the White House said, an official of apast U.S. administration had broached some ideas for asolution. But it was unclear whether they were his own orrepresented a formal overture from Baghdad, and the WhiteHouse said there was &quot;nothing in this particular proposalthat merited its pursuit.&quot;   Some analysts worry that Mr. Bush may have createdlong-term problems for himself in setting one of those fourgoals, the restoration of the ousted emir of Kuwait. Evenamong Arabs that deplore Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, Kuwait'sruling al Sabah family wasn't very popular, and Americans aremore comfortable if they can be told they are battling fordemocracy rather than royalty.   Yet now if Mr. Bush accepts anything less than restorationof the Kuwaiti emir as part of a negotiated deal with Iraq,he would be seen as having failed to achieve one of hisfundamental goals -- and in the process would unsettle theruling royal family in neighboring Saudi Arabia. Mr. Bushseemed to waver on this goal this week, saying in passingthat whether the wealthy ruling family remains in power is &quot;amatter for the Kuwaitis to decide.&quot;   Beyond that, administration officials are torn by the ideaof going well beyond the stated goal of forcing an Iraqiwithdrawal from Kuwait and using the current crisis as anexcuse to get rid of Saddam Hussein and destroy his ominouschemical and nuclear weapons programs.   Officials worry that the U.S. could bite off more than itcould chew in the Gulf by adopting grander and grander goals.The administration is sobered by memories of the Korean War,when the U.S. tried to go beyond simply protecting SouthKorea and ended up bogged down in a long war that succeededonly in preserving the status quo.   And while the idea of using the big American militaryforce against Iraq is tempting, the administration alsorealizes that current Arab support for the internationalcampaign against Saddam Hussein could shatter as soon asAmerican bullets begin killing Arab soldiers.   So Mr. Bush at the moment is saying, in essence, thathe'll leave a big American army and armada in the regionwhile he waits for international economic sanctions to forceIraq out of Kuwait. And in the meantime, he's willing to giveothers' diplomatic efforts a chance, but he doesn't see muchhope in them.   As Congress begins returning to Washington from its Augustrecess, that position leaves the administration open tocomplaints from two sides -- from those who want to go muchfurther and those who fear the administration may yet go toofar.   &quot;The president needs to formulate our goal in terms ofeliminating the military capacity of Iraq,&quot; said Sen.Lautenberg after meeting with Mr. Bush Tuesday. &quot;That is aclear policy.&quot; Similarly, Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana, oneof the Republican Party's most influential lawmakers onforeign policy, flatly declared that Saddam Hussein posessuch a long-term threat to the Gulf that &quot;he does have toleave the leadership of the country, and beyond that, many ofthe forces that he has aggregated have to be removed as athreat.&quot;   By contrast, Nebraska Democratic Sen. Robert Kerreydeclared in a television interview over the weekend that &quot;theonly justification that I find legitimate&quot; for dispatchingAmerican forces to the Gulf was preventing an invasion ofSaudi Arabia. &quot;I question a response that says that we'regoing to go there and have our young people die so that wecan have cheap oil here at home, or cheap gasoline here athome,&quot; he said on NBC-TV's &quot;Meet the Press.&quot;   And in fact, the administration at one point seemed toflirt with using cheap oil as one reason for putting Americansoldiers in the line of hostilities. President Bush declaredto a Pentagon audience that &quot;our jobs, our way of life, ourown freedom and the freedom of friendly countries around theworld would all suffer if control of the world's great oilreserves fell into the hands of that one man, SaddamHussein.&quot;   But such a rationale undermines support for the U.S. evenamong friendly Arabs, because it implies that the U.S. isinterested only in grabbing Arab oil and not in the region'sother political or economic problems. And some lawmakersreport that, even among Americans, the oil argument isn'tpersuasive; some voters would rather pay a few cents more fora gallon of gas than risk having their sons or daughterskilled in combat.   As long as the Bush administration has &quot;stayed on the highground of opposing aggression in one form or another, they'rein good shape,&quot; says Richard Murphy, who was the StateDepartment's top Middle East diplomat during much of theReagan administration. &quot;When you start talking about our wayof life . . . it causes you a hell of a problem with theAmerican public because they don't think Americans should beshot at for $18, $20 or $21 dollar-a-barrel oil.&quot;   The administration seems to be on the verge of crafting amore sophisticated argument in which it can call the Americanmilitary deployment a significant success even if SaddamHussein remains in power in Baghdad.   Officials are starting to contend that, however thiscrisis ends, the U.S. will have so radically altered thepolitical ground rules in the Persian Gulf that Iraq will becontained and American friends protected against furtheraggression. The U.S. will have set a precedent for rapidlyintervening to protect Saudi Arabia, and might well leavebehind significant stockpiles of military equipment andperhaps some American Air Force personnel to guard the Saudikingdom. And at the same time, the argument goes, other,smaller Gulf oil states have moved further under the Americandefense umbrella as a result of the crisis, making them lessvulnerable at the same time.   That argument may well have broad appeal -- but so far, itisn't one President Bush has made publicly.   ---          `Should the U.S. Take Military Action?'
