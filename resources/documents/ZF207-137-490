(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Karyl ScottandM;and Steve HigginsandM;The absence of TCP/IP support in Microsoft Corp.'s LAN Manager, a full yearafter the company promised to deliver the transport protocols, has left someusers in the lurch for a means to connect their local networks tolarge-system environments.andM;Beta versions of Microsoft's TCP/IP code are being supplied to LAN Managerlicensees who have asked for it, and commercial versions will be available inthe second half of this year, said Stephen Kanzler, product manager forMicrosoft's Networking Business Unit in Redmond, Wash.andM;TCP/IP support will enable LAN Manager workstations to download data from aTCP/IP host to a LAN Manager server for use in server applications.andO;Currently, a workstation on any local area network requires a network cardand TCP/IP drivers to exchange files with a host.andM;Microsoft's LAN Manager TCP/IP code was licensed from Excelan Corp.andO;Microsoft's initial implementation of the TCP/IP protocols required too muchmemory, so Microsoft asked Excelan to amend the code to use less memory, saidPaul Maritz, general manager of Microsoft's Networking Business Unit.andM;The delays caused by the changes made LAN Manager users like Stan Hanson lookelsewhere for TCP/IP support for their 3Com Corp. 3+Open networks.andM;''We have some minicomputer TCP/IP networks that we need to link to 3+Openservers in order to send CAD/CAM [computer-aided design/manufacturing] datafrom the minis to be incorporated into text documents on PCs,'' said Hanson,vice president of engineering at Northrop Corp.'s Defense Systems Division inChicago.andP;  ''We're considering going directly to Excelan for the TCP/IPcode.''andM;3Com and Hewlett-Packard Co. are not relying on Microsoft's TCP/IP code.andP;  Thetwo companies are planning a summer release of a TCP/IP package that willenable 3+Open servers to exchange files with HP's Unix minicomputers.andM;But the HP/3Com products, as well as a package under development byUngermann-Bass Inc., may not interoperate with the TCP/IP code as released byMicrosoft, creating possible incompatibilities between a 3+Open server using3Com/HP's TCP/IP and a Unix host using Microsoft's TCP/IP, said Kanzler.andM;''We will provide the basic standards against which the licensees willtest,'' he said.andP;  ''We're all interested in providing transparent transportto end users and interoperability, and we're all working together toward thatend.''andM;Even though TCP/IP support seems to have been relegated to a secondaryposition in vendors' LAN Manager strategies, some industry analysts saidTCP/IP is critically important for long-term market acceptance of the networkoperating system.andM;For one thing, TCP/IP is the only standards-based technology that providesinteroperability between different networks and different computingplatforms, said Steve Spanier, a network consultant at market researcherInfonetics Inc., in Santa Clara, Calif.andM;''I think it's forward-looking on the part of the vendors to realize thatdemand for TCP/IP to link PCs into minicomputers and mainframes is growing,''said Daniel Lynch, president of Advanced Computing Environments, acommunications consulting firm in Mountain View, Calif.andM;''LAN Manager is good at linking PCs and applications over a local cable,''he continued.andP;  ''Once you move data out to another cable [network], itdoesn't function very well.andP;  It can't tell what machine it's talking to.andO;That's where TCP/IP is useful.''andM;Once TCP/IP is fully implemented in LAN Manager systems, the interconnectionof LAN Manager-based applications with TCP/IP host-based applications stillwill be difficult, said James VanBokkelen, president of FTP Software Inc., aninternetworking software developer in Waltham, Mass.andM;''LAN Manager implements TCP/IP running under Microsoft's proprietary SMB[Server Message Block] operating-system protocols,'' he said.andP;  ''SMB speaksto the applications in a different way than TCP/IP networks speak to TCPapplications such as Telnet.andM;''For that reason, LAN Manager will be able to provide basic TCP transportbut not applications-level communications.andP;  To have that, you must develop anOS/2 program interface under which you provide utilities to allowapplications-level communications.''andM;FTP Software is developing such an interface, said VanBokkelen.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
