<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-67-0626 </DOCNO><TEXT>The propagation characteristic of ELF (10 Hz - 1500 Hz) electromagneticwaves observed on ARCAD 3, in three different zones: low L value (L andless;4), medium L values (4 andless; L andless; 6) and high L values (Landgt;6). Unambiguousdeterminations of the wave normal directions are obtained from the interpretationsof the measurements of four (3 magnetic, 1 electric) wave field components.The technique that is used, is based on the Means method in the casesof highly polarized waves and on the Storey and Lefeuvre WDF method inthe other cases. A particular emphasis is put on the propagation characteristicsof the waves, in a multiple ion plasma, and on the cut-off frequencieswhich appear at and below the local proton gyrofrequency.</TEXT></DOC>
