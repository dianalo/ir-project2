Wright said the House would also vote on banning members fromreceiving speaking fees and other honoraria. Because House memberscurrently can retain up to 30 percent of salary in honoraria, thosereceiving the maximum would receive no actual raise.   ``The House will vote next week to ban all honorariums and to cutthe pay raise to 30 percent instead of 50 percent. That'll make itjust come out even,'' Wright told reporters.   A 30 percent raise would hike the current congressional salary by$26,850, to a total of $116,350.   A Democratic leadership aide, who spoke only on condition ofanonymity, said Wright planned for the vote to take place after theraise would become law next Wednesday. This would roll back theincrease for lawmakers and executive branch officials, but not forjudges, whose salary cannot be reduced under the Constitution.   The Senate planned to vote today or Friday, and was virtuallycertain to turn down the 50 percent raise, which would boost mostcongressional salaries from $89,500 to $135,000.   Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill. who has met with Wright andplans further meetings, ``has not signed off on the 30 percent payraise proposal nor the idea of a vote the following day,'' saidJohanna Schneider, Michael's spokeswoman.   Wright said ``of course there's always a chance'' that hisproposal would be defeated. But he said he was encouraged by answersgiven by 326 House members to a survey he conducted this week on thepay raise.   Without announcing the results, Wright said:   ``They indicate that the members feel that they should give upthe honororia and they should substitute a straightforward, upfrontway in which they would receive and all other people in thegovernment would receive a decent raise, but not an exorbitantraise, and that they ought to vote to do it. I think it's upbeat.''   Wright has tried to convince his colleagues for weeks to reducethe raise to 30 percent but told reporters previously the memberswere privately telling him they wanted 50 percent without a vote.The raise becomes law unless both houses of Congress vote to stop it.   Wright appeared to be going along with these private sentimentsuntil he abruptly reversed course this week and ordered the survey.Aides said the speaker was tired of reading that he was stopping thewill of a majority to vote on the raise.   An Associated Press informal survey of nearly a third of the435-member House showed about 88 percent of those responding wanteda vote on the larger package.   Groups opposed to the increase said their own survey showed thatslightly more than 60 percent would vote ``no.''   Meanwhile, House and Senate negotiators moved ahead Wednesdaywith separate but similar proposals to bar speaking fees andrestrict other outside income should the raise become law.   A bipartisan draft document, given to senators and obtained byThe Associated Press, compared the latest House and Senate proposalson outside income.   Both packages would ban honoraria, including fees for speeches,appearances and articles, upon enactment of the raise.   Leaders in both houses have made clear that honoraria wouldcontinue if the pay raise is defeated because members don't want tosuffer a loss of income. House members currently can retain $26,850and Senate members $35,800 in honoraria.   The Senate plan includes a contingency that would permitretention of some honoraria if the raise is partially scaled backlater.   The plans under discussion in both houses would permit such feesto be donated to charity on a member's behalf. The Senate plan wouldlimit the donation to $2,000 per appearance and require members tolist on financial disclosure forms the amount, the payer and therecipient of the donation.   Wright did not get full cooperation from his colleagues in hissurvey. House Republican Whip Dick Cheney, R-Wyo., told his hometownpaper, the Casper Star-Tribune: ``I didn't return the form. I don'tdo polls.''   The Associated Press contacted 143 congressional offices andfound 92 members publicly supporting a recorded vote on the payraise. Only six said they were against it and seven were undecided.There was no response from 38 offices.   The survey released Wednesday by raise opponents, indicating 62percent of House members opposed to the increase, was conducted byPublic Citizen, a consumer advocacy group founded by Ralph Nader,and two conservative groups: the National Taxpayers Union andCoalitions for America.   The proposed honoraria plans would allow groups that invitemembers to an event to continue paying for travel. The Senate woulddirect its ethics committee to issue rules and regulations definingacceptable limits.   The House draft would prohibit members from receiving any pensionbenefits from honoraria given as a charitable donation. The Senateplan would go further, prohibiting conversion of any of thedonations to a member's personal use.   The House plan would limit all outside earned income to 15percent of a member's salary, half the current 30 percent.   The House also would end a provision in federal law that hasallowed 190 House members, in office before 1980, to accumulate $39million in campaign funds that could be converted to personal use.The measure would become effective in January 1991, giving Housemembers one chance to retire with the money. The Senate already hasa rule prohibiting such conversion.</TEXT></DOC>
