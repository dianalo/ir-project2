Gene?</HEAD><TEXT>   Q. Mr. Vice President, last night, when you celebrated yourvictory here in Houston, you spoke of reaching out to all Americans,including those who did not support your candidacy. Other thansimply calling for unity, what specifically do you intend to do toachieve it?   And, secondly, how do you intend to approach Congress'cooperation you will need, after spending so much of your campaignbashing the Congress?   A: Well, I think the way to heal is to have meetings with variouspeople, maybe those who have not supported us, make very clearthrough this forum, and others, that I mean what I said, and theAmerican people are wonderful when it comes to understanding when acampaign ends and the work of business begins.   I don't think I was particularly in a ``Congress bashing'' modefor the most of the campaign, but I will _ I have my principles, theAmerican people, in voting for me, voted for certain things.   Congress understands that, and I understand the Congress. I'veserved in the Congress. And so, I don't think it will be _ you know,that they'll do everything my way, and _ but I will try very hardbecause I start with a great respect for the institution in which Iserve. Yeah, Terry?   Q. Mr. Vice President, what kind of job will you give Dan Quaylein your administration? Will he have the same access to the _ allthe papers that you saw from President Reagan? And will he _ if youcould just describe what he would be able to _ what he'll do.   A. I haven't formulated in detail, but certainly he will haveaccess to the papers, access to the intelligence, access to theinformation because it is essential that a vice president be up tospeed on every sensitive matter involving the government lestsomething happen to the president. These two, right on the aisle.   Q. Mr. Vice President, a lot of people said in 1980 PresidentReagan was able to really accomplish objectives in his first termbecause he had a game plan that he moved swiftly on in the first 90days. Will you have a game plan, and, if so, sir, can you give ussome sense of what it will be?   A. I will have a game plan. Part of what the transition is aboutis to spell out the priorities. I spelled them out in broad terms,in terms of keeping the economic expansion going, and in terms ofworld peace, but the election ended yesterday.   We will now have 70-whatever days it is to formulate a game plan, a first 100 days' priorities, if you will, and they'll bespecific, and I will do my level best to fulfill my commitments tothe American people. Dave?   Q. Mr. Vice President, in your campaign, you laid out a veryambitious agenda to deal with the Soviet Union _ eliminate chemicaland biological weapons, conventional weapons, finish the work onstrategic arms. Can any of this go forward as long as the Sovietsdelay their withdrawal from Afghanistan? Do you see any linkagebetween your plans, looking ahead, and the reality?   A. I would not throw any firm linkage there but, clearly, one ofthe things I've addressed myself to in this campaign is the need forcontinued reduction of regional tension. And if the Soviets made adetermination not to pull out of Afghanistan, which I doubt theywill do, that would throw a complicating factor over the wholerelationship. I believe that the Soviets will keep their commitment.Yes, Saul, and then Britt.   Q. You said a few days ago, but haven't mentioned since, thatyou're going to be trying to seek an early meeting with Mr.Gorbachev. Now that you've named Jim Baker, do you expect that hewill begin at some point soon to try to seek that meeting?   A. Not before January 20th. And I said would _ I would have thesecretary meet with the NATO leaders _ his counterparts in NATO, andthat then he would meet with Mr. Shevardnadze, and that then hewould make clear to the Soviets that I would be willing to meet withMr. Gorbachev and that is about the way _ but, I don't think, Saul,that would start, you know, before the president _ before I becomepresident of the United States.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
