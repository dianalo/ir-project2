LEVI</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Mexico has told the International MonetaryFund it aims to slash payments on its huge foreign debt to get itsstagnant economy growing again, two leading newspapers saidWednesday.   The privately owned El Financiero and the government newspaper ElNacional said President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's administrationinformed the IMF in a draft-letter of intent that it plans to reducepayments to 2 percent from 5 percent of the annual gross nationalproduct over the next three years.   El Financiero said the letter was drafted after an IMF teamvisited Mexico City last week to evaluate an application for $500million in ``special drawing rights'' to bolster the country'sforeign currency reserves. Special drawing rights, or SDRs, are atype of international money created by the IMF for use in settlinginternational payment imbalances.   Treasury Secretary Pedro Aspe toured Mexico's principal creditornations in February, unsucessfully seeking $100 million in freshloans from private banks, together with a reduction in the papervalue of the country's debt.   Quoting unnamed government sources, the two newspapers said thedebt situation was analyzed by Aspe and other members of thecabinet's economic team at a meeting with Salinas Tuesday night.   Government spokesmen refused to talk about the debt situation.``In due time, we shall make the appropriate information public,''Treasury Department spokesman Rafael Diaz de Leon replied in atelephone interview Wednesday.   Salinas wants to use money saved on debt payments to spureconomic growth to about 4.5 percent annually, El Nacional said.   After two decades of 6 percent growth, the economy completelystagnated under Salinas' predecessor, President Miguel de la Madrid,in part due to an austerity program put into effect to keep up withdebt payments.   Despite efforts to encourage non-petroleum exports, reducegovernment deficit spending and cut inflation, the economy hasremained in the doldrums.   Salinas _ de la Madrid's budget secretary _ has been warningsince he took office in December that Mexico may be forced tosuspend debt payments if it fails to wrest timely concessions fromforeign creditors.   Officials have been saying Mexico wants to cut its annual servicecosts by about $7 billion from the $14 billion in principal andinterest paid last year and the $16 billion scheduled for 1989.   The World Bank estimates Mexico's debt was $106 billion inDecember. Deputy Treasury Secretary Jose Angel Gurria on Tuesdaydenied the debt had gone up to $108 billion and said it was actuallyon $100 billion.   Gurria said in a television interview that the public sectorforeign debt currently stands at $81 billion, the short-terminter-bank debt at $7 billion, the private sector debt at $7billion, and the International Monetary Fund is owed another $5billion.   El Financiero quoted the eight-page letter to the IMF as sayingthe ``present (debt) situation is not acceptable or sustainable''and ``it is urgent the Mexican economy start growing again'' inorder to check growing unemployment.   From 1982 to 1988 the economy failed to grow, per capita incomedropped some 15 to 20 percent, the purchasing power of wages washalved, the newspaper quoted the letter as saying.   The letter said Mexico needs to create 1 million jobs annuallyjust to take care of new entries in the job market, but created only1 million jobs over the six-year period.   On the positive side, the letter noted that inflation was reducedfrom 159 percent in 1987 to 52 percent in 1988 and is projected atno more than 20 percent this year.   The letter said that during that period, Mexico's nonpetroleumexports have jumped from $3 billion to $14 billion last year,roughly equaling the income derived from crude oil, according to thenewspaper.</TEXT></DOC>
