<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-54-0811 </DOCNO><TEXT>We show that scattering processes in anisotropic superconductors havesome unexpected asymmetries when the normal-state phase shift is neithersmall nor resonant. The scattering rate is not symmetric about the Fermisurface, which gives rise to large thermoelectric effects. For stateswith gaps that have nontrivial phase variations over the Fermi surface,certain components of transport coefficients tensors can be finite eventhough they vanish in the normal state.</TEXT></DOC>
