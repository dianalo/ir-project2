Developing countries like India have missed the industrialrevolution of the last two centuries and the main needs of energy aremet by non-commercial resources like cow dung, fuel wood and agriculturalwasters. Substantial improvements have taken place since the 1950's,but per capita consumption of commercial energy (coal, petroleum andelectricity) will remain 1/8th of the world average. The commercial energyin India accounts for a little over half of the energy today. India adoptedthe five year plan strategy to improve the energy inputs and thus thequality of life after it gained independence. Six such plans have beencompleted and the developments that have taken place so far in the conventionalenergy sector viz. coal, petroleum and hydro-electricity; nuclear energyand in the field of nonconventional energy sources such as Biogas, Biomass,Solar thermal, solar photovoltaics, wind, and other renewable energieswill be discussed. The perspectives on energy in the year 2000 will bepresented.</TEXT></DOC>
