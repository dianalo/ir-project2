The Occupational Safety and Health Administration said itsinvestigation of last October's blast, which injured another 130workers, demonstrated the need for mandatory safety procedures atplants that store and use highly flammable liquids and chemicals.   ``The investigation of the Phillips catastrophe has caused OSHAto take stock and consider a strong course of action to preventsuch disasters,'' the report to Bush said.   OSHA said that by the end of the summer it would proposerequirements that employers implement so-called chemical processsafety management plans.   Those plans would include analyzing hazards to employees,training workers on safety and developing emergency responseprocedures, said Assistant Labor Secretary Gerard Scannell, whoheads OSHA.   Scannell said that most firms in the petrochemical industryalready use such fundamental safety procedures, but OSHA's newrules would make them mandatory.   OSHA also will consider revising the way it sets priorities forinspections and devoting more attention to the petrochemicalindustry, Scannell said.   Last week, OSHA proposed a $5.7 million fine against Phillips 66Co. for alleged safety violations at the plant. OSHA'sinvestigation showed that four highly flammable gases escaped froman open valve, forming a huge vapor cloud that traveled through thePasadena, Texas, plant within seconds because of high pressure.   A series of explosions occurred after the cloud came in contactwith an unidentified ignition source.   Contrary to Phillips' own procedures, as well as standardindustry practice, there was no backup protection such as a doublevalve to protect against valve failure or protect against anuntimely valve opening, Scannell said.</TEXT></DOC>
