The Japanese currency would be used for intervention in foreign exchange markets to support the dollar.    President Reagan and Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita also issued a joint statement in which they called further declines in the dollar's value &quot;counterproductive&quot; and exchange-rate stability &quot;indispensable.&quot;    The communique, issued following a meeting in Washington between the heads of state, added that the two countries &quot;are cooperating closely on exchange markets and have developed arrangements to assure the adequacy of resources for their cooperative efforts.&quot;    The statement immediately resurrected rumors that the U.S. will issue yen-denominated bonds, referred to as Reagan bonds, in order to raise foreign currency for intervention in the foreign exchange markets. The dollar climbed higher on this speculation.    But later reports, based on a press briefing by a senior administration official who requested anonymity, indicated that the statement referred to a plan for the U.S. to swap special drawing rights of the International Monetary Fund for yen from Japan, a step that would also provide the U.S. with foreign funds to intervene in support of the dollar.    Traders interpreted this news as bullish for the dollar, at least in the short run. In the late 1970s, the U.S. succeeded in reversing a dollar decline by raising funds for intervention by issuing foreign-currency denominated bonds that were dubbed Carter Bonds. Exchanging special drawing rights held by the U.S. for yen was seen yesterday as possibly the next best alternative.    &quot;It smells like and tastes like Reagan bonds,&quot; Varick Martin, vice president of foreign exchange at Union Bank of Switzerland, New York, said of the new plan.    Special drawing rights, or SDRs, are units created by the International Monetary Fund, valued at the weighted average value of a basket of currencies consisting of the dollar, West German mark, French franc, British pound and yen.    Traders said the White House's disclosure of plans to acquire more foreign currency for supporting the dollar through intervention seemed intended as a warning for them not to speculate against the dollar. Despite the dollar's rebound in response to aggressive intervention this year, many traders have maintained their negative long-term outlook for the U.S. currency, based on the belief that the Federal Reserve's resources for intervention were limited, in contrast to the market's vast resources.    But some traders said that a swap deal involving SDRs for yen suggests that even Japan expects the dollar to decline further, despite its own efforts to buttress the U.S. currency. Traders said it would be simpler for Japan to directly swap its yen for dollars, but the government may be reluctant to increase its holdings of the U.S. currency if Japan expected the dollar's value to decline further.    &quot;The Bank of Japan doesn't want the dollars,&quot; said David Buchen, a principal of Buchen, Kurz andamp; Co., a New York foreign exchange firm.    The dollar's initial drop Wednesday came in Tokyo trading, in response to a denial by the Japanese Finance Minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, that the Group of Seven nations had agreed to keep the U.S. currency within a rough range between 125 and 140 Japanese yen. Reports of such an agreement last week, attributed to unnamed Japanese officials, contributed to the dollar's powerful rally from record lows in the first four trading days of the year last week and helped sustain it.    The dollar's turnaround yesterday was engineered by a broad front of nine central banks making modest purchases of the U.S. currency against at least five different currencies, in markets around the world. The central banks of West Germany, Switzerland, and Italy confirmed they intervened to support the dollar. Also, traders here and abroad said the Fed, and the central banks of Japan, France, the Netherlands, Belgium and Austria intervened.    &quot;It's easier to name the ones who weren't in: Malta and Liechtenstein,&quot; said Michael A. Gotthelf, president of Metallbank Capital Corp., New York, a West German-based investment house.    The dollar was quoted at 127.30 yen in late New York trading Wednesday. That was off slightly from 127.38 yen Tuesday, but up sharply from the dollar's intraday low of 125.50 in Asian dealings.    The dollar managed to climb to 1.6375 marks, up from 1.6225 earlier in the day, and 1.6325 Tuesday.    In early Tokyo trading Thursday, the dollar was quoted at 127.05 yen.    Mr. Gotthelf said yesterday's intervention was meant as a signal to traders that the major central banks remain ready to support the dollar aggressively, should it come under pressure from Friday's report on November U.S. merchandise trade. A sharp reduction in the trade deficit, which stood at a record $17.63 billion in October, is considered essential to sustaining a turnaround in the dollar's nearly three-year-old downward trend. And a November trade deficit much over $15 billion is seen pressuring the dollar lower.    &quot;Nobody knows what the figure will be, but they (central banks) fear it will be bad and want to scare the market from pushing the dollar much lower,&quot; Mr. Gotthelf said.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell 50 cents an ounce to $480.20 in moderate trading. The estimated volume was 2.8 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $481.55 an ounce in early trading Thursday in Hong Kong.    ---                     LATE NEW YORK TRADING                   Wednesday, Jan. 13, 1988   Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates.
