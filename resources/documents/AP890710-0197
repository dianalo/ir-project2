Under new leadership, it is using a new tactic:non-violence. In West Virginia, old-timers wonder whether the peacewill last.</TEXT><TEXT/><NOTE>By JULES LOH</NOTE><NOTE>AP Special Correspondent</NOTE><DATELINE>SLAB FORK, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Curled wood shavings litter the bare dirtunder the awning over the picnic table. The shavings are the residueof whittling, and sweeten the mountain air with an aroma of cedar.   Horseshoe pits are handy. A basketball hoop occupies a nearbyutility pole. Jury-rigged wires from the same pole send juice to amakeshift shack containing a card table, coffee maker, electric fan,icebox. Four Rent-O-Lets are convenient. The sounds are of bird songand a rushing stream, the Slab Fork of Rum Creek.   Are West Virginia's coal miners on a summer outing?   ``Hey, we're in a fight, not on a picnic,'' said Bethel Purkey.``And it's one hell of a fight. But, yeah,'' he said, nodding,``times have changed.   ``We are now doing non-violent civil disobedience. Some of ourbrothers and sisters have a hard time getting hold of that, but it'sworking.   ``This strike is going to be a new beginning for us, or an end _but I don't see an end. I see us winning with this tactic and comingback as strong or stronger than we ever were.''   Purkey is president of Local 5815 of the United Mine Workers ofAmerica.   He is 40, a big man with thick, freckled arms and a bristling redbeard. He admits to having been in his share of brawls, as had hisfather who was a miner, and his grandfather, who died in a cave-in.But Purkey represents a new generation of leadership on the picketline that is putting a new face on the UMW, one of the nation'srowdiest unions.   And he is right. Here in the coal fields of Appalachia, throughtwo months and more of the biggest mine labor dispute in years,times have certainly changed.   Time was, and not long ago, when a West Virginia picket shacksuch as the one at Slab Fork would have been littered not withperfumed cedar shavings but with spent cartridge shells and thesmell of gunpowder.   ``The way they used to stop a truck in the old days,'' Purkeyrecalls, ``was to turn it over and haul the driver out and give hima good thumping. I've seen people shot at, ours and theirs, andpeople thrown in the river, ours and theirs.   ``Now we just stand there and ask the driver to honor our picketline. If he says no we stand there anyhow. Or sit down. The truckshave been turning around.   ``We don't allow any alcohol on the picket line. We don't allowanybody we don't know. We have a captain on every shift, at sixsites, 24 hours a day.   ``Everything is under tight control and discipline. It's working.I don't know how long it will keep working because you can push aman only so far and we have been sorely provoked, but for now it'sworking.''   Purkey and others on the picket line say their new style ofconducting a strike has percolated down from the union president,Richard Trumka, who, they say, has brought them a sense of pride anddignity not felt since the glory days of union founder John L. Lewis.   ``We have a smart man at the head of this organization,'' Purkeysays. ``I have faith in him. All of us do.''   Purkey, along with 350 miners in West Virginia and 1,250 inVirginia, have been on strike since April 5 against the PittstonCoal Group's operations in both states. They went out after working14 months without a contract. Another 300 Kentucky miners joinedthem in June, and that strike touched off sympathy walkoutsinvolving 43,000 miners in 10 states in Appalachia and the Midwest.   Fellow coal miners weren't the only ones, however, drawn to theUMW cause.   ``Your commitment to non-violence and the use of passive civildisobedience has captured the attention of organized labor,'' saidCesar Chavez, the West Coast farm workers' leader, at a recent rallyin Virginia. As long as the miners continue their non-violent ways,Chavez predicted, the public would be on the UMW side.   Public support as well as economic pressure clearly is the UMWstrategy. At that same rally, UMW vice president Cecil Robertsdeclared: ``We've got the whole country on our side now. We arewinning this strike.''   That remains to be seen. A more immediate question facing boththe miners and the coal industry is whether the current wave ofunion support represents a newfound solidarity or the last gasp ofbig labor.   Back in the 1940s, under John L. Lewis, the union could call500,000 members out of the mines and bring the entire industry toits knees. After Lewis retired in 1961, the union began a 20-yeardownhill slide.   Lewis' successor, Tony Boyle, was sent to prison for ordering themurder of a union rival as well as his wife and daughter. Boyle'ssuccessor, Arnold Miller, watched a proliferation of wildcat strikessplinter the union and hamper recruitment in the anthracite fieldsopening in Western states. His successor, Sam Church, lostrank-and-file respect by giving back a number of hard-won benefits,one after a strike of 111 days, another of 72 days.   ``For a long time,'' said Purkey, ``our people didn't really seeanybody up there they had much confidence in until Trumka camealong.''</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
