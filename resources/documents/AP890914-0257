After losing a pair of procedural votes by substantial margins,senators from cigarette-industry states accepted the inevitable andabandoned their efforts to dilute the proposed tougher restrictions.   The provision _ banning cigarette smoking aboard all domesticairline flights _ was then formally adopted by the Senate on a voicevote. Final passage of a spending bill containing the language waspossible later in the day.   On the key vote, the Senate voted 77-21 to prevent a filibusterby cigarette industry supporters who had promised to bringlegislative action to a standstill unless the smoking ban waslimited to short flights. Tobacco lawmakers then lost a secondprocedural vote 65-34.   Supporters of the measure to prohibit smoking aboard all U.S.airline flights had said in advance that they had the 60 votesneeded to invoke cloture and halt the filibuster.   ``No doubt about it,'' the chief sponsor, Sen. Frank Lautenberg,D-N.J., said Wednesday.   Smoking-ban opponents served notice that even if they lost, theywould keep trying to block the proposal, which is part of an $11.9billion transportation spending bill for next year. Sen. ErnestHollings, D-S.C., promised to try to quash the smoking measure onprocedural grounds.   ``I've got 25,000 or 30,000 tobacco farmers in North Carolina towhom I have made a commitment that I'd protect their interests aslong as I'm in the U.S. Senate,'' said Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.``And I'm going to do that.''   elms said Lautenberg ``may end up rolling us, but he will knowthat he has been in a fight.''   Tobacco state lawmakers, sensing the fight was not going theirway, said they would settle for a permanent extension of the currentsmoking ban on flights of two hours or less.   That restriction, which covers 80 percent of all U.S. routes,will otherwise expire next April. The House on Aug. 3 adopted aprovision making the two-hour rule permanent.   In offering to accept the permanent ban on short flights, Sen.Wendell Ford, D-Ky., said he and his allies would slow the Senate'swork on other matters if the other side persisted in seeking broaderrestrictions. Congressional leaders want to finish 13 spending billsby the Oct. 1 start of fiscal 1990.   ``There's more at stake here I think than just the question ofsmoking on airliners,'' Ford said. ``It's a question of the budgetso the rest of world can work.''   Airline employees and health groups have pressed for a totalsmoking ban on aircraft, claiming that cigarette fumes can cause arisk of cancer and other diseases for everyone aboard a flight.   Tobacco interests say there is no proof that cigarette smokeendangers non-smokers and argue that there are plenty of otherchemicals in recirculated aircraft cabin air.   Meanwhile, Surgeon General C. Everett Koop on Wednesdaycriticized U.S. tobacco marketing at home and abroad, saying Americais not respected overseas ``because of the manner in which we exportdisease and death.''   Koop said the epithet ``ugly American'' will ``indeed come hometo roost in a decade or two when the developing countries of todayrealize what we did to them.''   He also told a House subcommittee the wide availability ofcigarette vending machines in the United States makes a mockery oflaws forbidding minors to buy cigarettes.   He supported a bill sponsored by Rep. Thomas Luken, D-Ohio, thatwould forbid the placement of cigarette vending machines in anylocation accessible to people under 18.</TEXT></DOC>
