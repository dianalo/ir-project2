(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A judge Friday imposed 15 years of probationon a cocaine-addicted mother convicted of delivering drugs to two ofher children at birth.   Jennifer Johnson, 23, faced a 30-year prison sentence on theconviction under a law usually applied to criminals engaged inillegal drug transactions.   ``I don't have any desire to hurt you. ... I'm not here to putyou in prison,'' Circuit Judge O.H. Eaton Jr. told Ms. Johnsonbefore handing down the sentence, which includes at least one yearin a residential drug-treatment program she is now attending.   Ms. Johnson is believed to be the first mother in Florida _ andone of only a few in the country _ convicted of providing drugs totheir newborns under a criminal drug-dealing law.   In a non-jury trial last month, Eaton determined that Ms. Johnsonhad delivered cocaine to her babies through their umbilical cords.He acquitted her of a child-abuse count.   The children _ a boy born in 1987 and a girl born in January _are cared for by relatives and are described as in in good health.But scientists have said that cocaine can cause neurologicalproblems, premature birth and even death in newborns.   Justifying the conviction under the statute which prohibits``delivery'' of an illegal substance from one person to another, thejudge ruled that ``a child who is born but whose umbilical cord hasnot (yet) been severed is a person'' within Florida law.   Other terms of the lengthy probation period included one year ofstrict supervision by probation officers during the rehabilitationprogram, random drug testing at least once a month for a year,educational and vocational training, an intense prenatal program ifshe should become pregnant again and 200 hours of community service.   Ms. Johnson, a slim, bespectacled woman with a ready smile,declined the judge's invitation to speak about her problem. But inresponse to the judge's question as to whether she believed she wasgetting some benefit from the drug-treatment program, she said,``Yes sir, I just feel a lot of pressure.''   Prosecutor Jeff Deen, who said the case would set a precedent inFlorida, had recommended strict compliance with the drug-treatmentprogram and lengthy probation. He had called it ``a child-abusecase, not a drug case.''   ``We want to send a message not of fear, but of hope'' todrug-addicted mothers to take care of their problems, Deen told thejudge.   ``She's used up all her chances,'' the prosecutor said. ``We needto ensure that this woman does not give birth to another cocainebaby. ... The message is that this community cannot afford to havetwo or three cocaine babies from the same person. ''   Defense attorney James Sweeting, who is appealing the conviction,maintained again that his client should not have been tried underthe drug-delivery statute. He said the Florida Legislature intendedthe law for drug traffickers, not mothers and children.   ``Giving birth to a child, we do not think this is a 30-yearfelony. ... This is not a criminal issue,'' Sweeting said after thesentencing. ``The Legislature has been usurped, overridden by thiscourt and this prosecution.''   In explaining his verdict issued last month, the judge said heconsidered the two children to be the victims because they ``had noability to control what was being introduced into their bodies.''   Ms. Johnson was acquitted by the judge of one count of childabuse. But other mothers giving birth to cocaine babies have beensuccessfully prosecuted under that law, which carries a maximum offive years in prison.</TEXT></DOC>
