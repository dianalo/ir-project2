The first question is measuring the total cost incurred to addeach unit of reserve inventory. Calculation of this cost involves consideringall the exploration costs plus all the costs for development drilling,production facilities, plants and pipelines, and including as reservesonly those that are proven and fully developed. Another question is howto calculate the values of reserves. This is determined by forecastingfuture income to be generated by producing the reserves and by discountingthis future income back to today, by taking into account the time valueof this money. Items that affect this future cash flow are recoverablereserves, annual production, prices, capital and operating cost, royaltiesand mineral taxes, and income taxes. The paper examines each of theseaccording to current Canadian conditions, especially income taxes, whichcan be the largest single expense of producing oil and gas and whichvaries from province to province. 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
