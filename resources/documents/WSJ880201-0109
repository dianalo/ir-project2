McCarthy (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> MD </CO><IN> AIR ARO </IN><TEXT>   McDonnell Douglas Corp. has cut its estimate of the number of firmly committed orders for its MD-11 jumbo jet, raising concerns that sales of the aircraft may be substantially less than previously expected.    Only two airlines have actually canceled conditional orders to buy the new tri-engine jet, McDonnell Douglas said in response to inquiries that it is now less certain that some of the orders it had been counting are as firm as it once thought.    Last May, the St. Louis-based aircraft and aerospace concern disclosed that it had 119 firm or conditional orders for the MD-11 from 17 airlines. But now the company says it has 29 firm orders and 47 conditional orders and options, for a total of 76. It says it also has 21 commitments, which a spokesman described as falling into &quot;various categories of intent to acquire the airplane.&quot;    The change in the backlog potentially represents the equivalent of several billion dollars in sales. McDonnell Douglas also said it currently is counting 14 carriers as customers, instead of the 17 it previously listed. The MD-11 is the successor of the DC-10.    Analysts said the reductions in the MD-11 backlog raise new concerns about the financial outlook for the MD-11 project, which has been widely viewed as a risky project from the start. Some noted that McDonnell Douglas will need to produce at least 150 of the wide-body planes to recover its planned $1.5 billion investment in the project and to break even. In addition, the MD-11 is facing tough competition in its relatively small niche of the market from rival aircraft built by Boeing Co. and the European Airbus Industrie consortium.    &quot;Having only 29 firm orders at this time calls into question the viability of the program,&quot; said Steve Binder, an analyst with Bear, Stearns andamp; Co. &quot;It's clearly a major question mark.&quot;    A McDonnell Douglas spokesman conceded that orders for the MD-11 aren't as strong as the company would like. But he insisted that the company remains &quot;optimistic.&quot; He added that the company expects to get more orders and to start more manufacturing in a few months.    Moreover, McDonnell Douglas has yet to nab any orders from a U.S. commercial passenger airline -- a task the company's directors once considered a crucial enough reason to hold up development of the plane. By some estimates, North American demand for commercial aircraft is 50% of the world-wide market. And U.S. carriers typically provide the most important market for makers of wide-body jets. &quot;All of us would feel better if American or United would say: 'Hey, we'll take 20 or 30,&quot;' said Peter Aseritis, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co.    But domestic carriers are less likely to say that now because of concerns that the U.S. economy may enter a recession, analysts said.    The MD-11 all along has had difficulty battling its rivals in the market for long-range wide-bodies: Boeing's 767 jet and Airbus Industrie's A-340. In an embarrassing turnabout a few weeks ago, Boeing swiped from McDonnell Douglas a big order from Scandinavian Airlines System -- the very order that spurred McDonnell Douglas to embark on its MD-11 program in December 1986.    Meanwhile, the MD-11 continues to drag earnings. On Friday, McDonnell Douglas reported flat fourth-quarter earnings of $92.6 million, or $2.32 a share. The results were hurt, in part, by expenses to develop the MD-11, which is scheduled for delivery in early 1990.    Analysts have long urged McDonnell Douglas to stick to production of its popular two-engine MD-80 jets, arguing that the company would never be able to recover the huge investment required to make the big jet, unless the plane caught on in the U.S. market.    But McDonnell pushed forward with its MD-11, a more fuel-efficient version of the DC-10. The MD-11 would fly longer distances and carry more passengers than its predecessor. Depending on the seating arrangement, an MD-11 could carry between 276 and 405 passengers. Among other things the company has argued that without producing a full-range of aircraft, it would face a rocky road in the market because many airlines prefer to stick with a common manufacturer for their aircraft needs.    In New York Stock Exchange trading Friday, McDonnell Douglas common closed at $63.50 a share, up $1.625. </TEXT></DOC>
