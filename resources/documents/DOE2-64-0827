This paper reviewsthe many types of intruder scenarios that have been proposed by variousagencies, along with the parameters that are important to them. The usesof the various scenarios are illustrated. The applications of recentlyevolving uncertainty techniques are emphasized. The possibility thatpeople could accidentally come in contact with buried wastes at sometime in the future has led to several considerations in waste management.Regulations state that design, operation, and closure of the land disposalfacility must ensure protection of any individual inadvertently intrudinginto the disposal site and occupying the site or contacting the wasteat any time after active institutional controls over the disposal siteare removed. Site suitability requirements, specifically those for lowpopulation density and absence of valuable resources, are based on minimizingthe potential for human intrusion. The requirements for waste form classificationand the extent of cover and barrier requirements for Class C waste aredesigned to minimize the dose to inadvertent intruders. 8 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
