But an entire industry revolves around the lending of billions of dollars of stocks, bonds and other types of securities.    Stock-loan departments of big brokerage firms get hefty fees in exchange for lending securities, as well as for matching lenders and borrowers. Big institutional investors such as corporate pension funds also make money by lending stock they own.    Now a wide-ranging federal criminal investigation of the stock-loan industry is focusing on this little-known and lucrative corner of Wall Street. Here are some questions and answers about how this business works.    Why do the brokerage firms need stock loan departments?    To ensure that stock is readily available to the firm and its customers, and to profit from the fees charged for the service.    Who needs to borrow stock?    Short sellers, takeover-stock speculators and just about any type of investor. Stocks are generally lent to firms and individuals who need stock quickly, and can't or don't want to purchase enough shares. A major use of borrowed stock is to make so-called short sales, in which an investor who anticipates a stock-price decline borrows shares of that stock and sells them. The investor profits if the stock falls, because he will pay less when buying shares to replace the stock he borrowed.    How does a stock loan work?    People who own stock can lend it for a fee. More typically, because interest rates are relatively high, the lender of the stock pays a fee for the use of money he gets when lending securities.    For example, a big investor orders 10,000 shares of XYZ Corp. from a trader who doesn't have it on hand. So, the trader arranges to borrow the stock from another firm, which lends stock that it is holding on behalf of its customers who bought stock on credit. The trader completes the sale of the XYZ stock to the investor and receives money which he then delivers to the firm that lent him the stock. In return for the use of the money, that firm pays the trader a so-called rebate, typically 75% of the interest cost that is paid by brokers for borrowing funds from a bank.    The firm that lent the stock issues a &quot;call notice&quot; when it needs the shares back. The trader has five days to deliver the stock. If the trader doesn't deliver, the firm &quot;buys him in&quot; by replacing its customers' stock on its own -- and eliminating the rebate to the trader.    Who else gets involved in stock loans?    Investors who have idle stock and firms that link borrowers and lenders.    For example, Yale University was one of the first big institutional investors to lend stock from its portfolio as a way of increasing its investment returns. Today, dozens of money managers, insurers, banks, pension funds and other large investors participate in the stock-loan business.    There are also &quot;broker-finders&quot; that get fees merely for matching borrowers and lenders of stock. Broker-finders can also include the brokerage firms themselves. The government is investigating whether all the payments that fly to and from such broker-finders are legitimate.    How much money is made by all this?    Millions of dollars a year. Stock-loan departments generate much of Wall Street's net interest income each year; indeed, interest income is sometimes the only item that makes a brokerage firm profitable. While firms don't break down publicly the profits of individual departments, the value of securities lent by Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. at the end of last year totaled more than $2.2 billion. The securities lending by other big firms is comparable.    Why did the stock-loan business get so big?    Two reasons. As the stock market exploded in the post-war period, the number of investors buying securities on margin, or credit, mushroomed. Brokerage firms typically use stock sold on margin and held at the firm to make stock loans. Meanwhile, the surge in futures-related program trading, corporate takeovers and takeover speculation, all of which require vast, rapid, purchases of securities, created a need for immediate lenders of securities. Jailed stock speculator Ivan F. Boesky, among others, was a big customer of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.'s stock-loan department. The former head of Shearson's stock-loan operations has agreed to plead guilty to criminal charges and cooperate in the government's investigation of the stock-loan business, people close to the case say.    Who regulates the stock-loan business?    Depending on the aspect of the business, the main regulators are the Federal Reserve Board, the New York Stock Exchange and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Fed determines the amount of credit that may be extended to investors by brokers and securities dealers. Both the Big Board and the SEC are responsible for regulating the possession and control of securities and can bring civil enforcement actions. </TEXT></DOC>
