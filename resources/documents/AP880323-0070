(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   NASA scientists are planning aninternational satellite system to study the atmosphere morecompletely, a program moved into high gear because of recentominous changes in the ozone layer and other problems.   The Earth Observing System will be an international network ofspace-based polar laboratories focusing on the planet's weather andecology, National Aeronautics and Space Administration projectscientist Dixon Butler said Tuesday.   ``This will bring about a revolution in our understanding of theEarth as a whole system,'' Butler said via satellite to scientistsat agency centers across the country, including the Jet PropulsionLaboratory in Pasadena.   The schedule for the program was recently accelerated because ofworrisome changes in the Earth's atmosphere, such as depletion inthe protective ozone layer, Butler said from NASA's Goddard SpaceFlight Center in Greenbelt, Md.   The six satellite labs will also monitor the so-called``greenhouse effect,'' in which the earth's temperature isgradually rising because of increased carbon dioxide in theatmosphere, Butler said   The agency is asking for $20 million in next year's budget tofinalize planning and preparations for launches beginning in 1995,said Charles Redmond, a spokesman for NASA's science division.   The project involves two satellites to be launched by Japaneseand European agencies, as well as four by NASA. It features anestimated $2 billion U.S. price tag, he said.   ``We need the intellectual resources of all mankind,'' Butlersaid. ``We must have international cooperation.''   NASA has already received about 870 letters from scientificgroups proposing experiments, he said. He also said Sovietparticipation is a possibility.   Instruments to be used on the satellites include a syntheticaperture radar, which uses radar waves to create images that wouldotherwise be hidden by clouds or vegetation.   Another is a ``geodynamics laser ranging system'' that coulddetect the slightest movement along such geological features asCalifornia's San Andreas Fault, Butler said.</TEXT></DOC>
