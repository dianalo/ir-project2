It hit 96 degrees at 4 p.m. _ the 31st day this summer that thetemperature exceeded 90 degrees. The record of 37 days was set in1944.   Consolidated Edison also reported a record for Sundayelectricity demand: 7,645 megawatts between 9 p.m. and 10 p.m.,breaking the record of 6,770 megawatts, set last Sunday. SpokesmanMarty Gitten said peak demand often occurs at that hour as peoplereturn home from weekend activities and turn on air conditionersand lights.   A horse put to work pulling a carriage across the sizzlingstreets collapsed of apparent heat prostration but apparentlysuffered no lasting effects, the authorities said.   The horse collapsed on a street on Manhattan's East Side shortlyafter noon. It lay for about 90 minutes before regaining enoughstrength to get into a trailer to be taken to its stable nearby,said William Kapps, chief law-enforcement officer of the AmericanSociety for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.   Horse-drawn sightseeing carriages are banned from city streetswhen the temperature tops 90 degrees. The temperature in CentralPark hit 90 at noon, the weather service said. It had not beendetermined if the carriage driver would be ticketed, Kapps said.   For the first time in its 30-year history, the New York RoadRunners Club changed a road race through Central Park to anon-competitive ``fun run'' because of the oppressive temperatures,said Fred Lebow, president of the club.   ``When we announced the decision to run it as a `fun run,' itwas soundly booed,'' he said. However, by the finish of the3.1-mile run, many of the more than 1,000 participants applaudedhis judgment, he said.   The decision was prompted in part by the deaths of two young menwho collapsed and died after running separate 3{-mile races insweltering heat earlier in the summer, Lebow said. Officials saidthe two men, who were participating in corporate team competitions,were not in proper shape to be running.   None of the runners in Sunday's event suffered any ill effectsfrom the heat and humidity, Lebow and the city's Emergency MedicalService said.   New York City has been roasting for six weeks, enduring whatFred Gadomski, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University,called the worst heat wave since the mid-1950s.</TEXT></DOC>
