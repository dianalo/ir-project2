Background</ITAG>Section 324 of the Energy Public and Conservation Act of 1975 (EPCA) \2\<NOTE/> requires the Commission to prescribe labeling rules for thedisclosure of estimated annual energy cost or alternative energy consumptioninformation for at least thirteen categories of appliances classified as``covered products'' by section 322(a) of EPCA: (1) Refrigerators and refrigerator-freezers;(2) freezers; (3) dishwashers; (4) clothes dryers; (5) water heaters; (6)room air conditioners; (7) home heating equipment, not including furnaces;(8) television sets; (9) kitchen ranges and ovens; (10) clothes washers;(11) humidifiers and dehumidifiers; (12) central air conditioners; and(13) furnaces. Before these labeling requirements may be prescribed, thestatute requires the Department of Energy (DOE) to develop test procedurethat measure how much energy the appliances uses. In addition, DOE is requiredto determine the representative average costs a consumer pays for the differenttypes of energy available. Congress provided, in section 324(b)(5) of EPCA,that the Commission could exempt from coverage products in categories 1-9if labeling is not technically or economically feasible, and products fromcategories 10-13 for the same reason or, alternatively, if labeling wouldnot be likely to assist consumers in making purchasing decisions.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Pub. L. 94-183, 89 Stat. 871 (Dec. 22, 1975).On November 19, 1979, the Commission issued a final Rule covering sevenof the twelve appliance categories that were then covered by DOE test procedures:refrigerators and refrigerator-freezers, freezers, dishwashers, water heaters,clothes washers, room air conditioners and furnaces.\3\<NOTE/> The Rule applies to products manufactured after May 19, 1980.The Commission recently amended the Rule to include the category of centralair conditioners and heat pumps.\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ 44 FR 66466, 16 CFR Part 305 (Nov. 19, 1979). The Statementof Basis and Purpose (SBP) for the Final Rule describes the reasons theCommission exempted the other categories of covered products. <T3>Id</T3>. at 66467-69. The SBP explains that the Commission concludedthat Congress intended, through the statutory exemption criteria, to permitproduct categories to be excluded, ``if the Commission found that the costof the labeling program would substantially outweigh any potential benefitsto consumers.'' <T3>Id</T3>. at 66467-68.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ 52 FR 46888 (Dec. 10, 1987).For most product categories, the Rule requires that dollar energy costsand related information be disclosed on labels and in retail sales catalogs.For three of the categories_room air conditioners, furnaces and centralair conditioners_dollar energy costs are impractical as the primary energyusage disclosure, for reasons discussed below. For these products, energyefficiency ratings (``EER's'') must be disclosed, either on the labels(for room air conditioners and central air conditioners) or on fact sheets(for furnaces).\5\<NOTE/> The corresponding cost information must be disclosed on thelabel for room air conditioners, on fact sheets for furnaces and for centralair conditioners on fact sheets or in a directory. These required disclosuresand all claims concerning energy consumption made in writing or in broadcastadvertisements must be based on the results of the DOE test procedures.Even products that the Commission exempted from the Rule's labeling requirementsmust be tested in accordance with the DOE procedures before energy claimscan be made. In addition, certain point-of-sale promotional materials mustdisclose the availability of energy cost or energy efficiency rating information.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ Generally defined, the energy factor is a measure of theuseful output of an appliance's services divided by the energy input. Whenpromulgating the test procedures, DOE, as required by EPCA, developed atleast two measures of energy consumption for each appliance category, one,based on estimated dollar cost of operation, and one other_the energy factor.In the case of climate control equipment, DOE used the nomenclature currentlyfollowed by the industry to describe the energy factor for those products.Hence, the energy factor for room air conditioners is called the EER (energyefficiency ratio), for furnaces, the AFUE (annual fuel utilization efficiency),for central air conditioners and the cooling function of heat pumps, theSEER (seasonal energy efficiency rating), and for the heating functionof heat pumps, the HSPF (heating seasonal performance factor). Under theCommission's Rule, all of these acronyms are referred to as the EER (energyefficiency rating) for the sake of simplicity. For the other appliances,this method of energy usage calculation is simply called the energy factorin the DOE test procedures.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. The Modifications: Proposed Amendments and Questions</ITAG>In today's <T4>Federal Register </T4>Notice, the Commission is: (1) Announcing andsoliciting comments on two proposed amendments concerning furnace requirements;(2) announcing and soliciting comments on a proposed amendment to the requirementsfor room air conditioners; and (3) soliciting comments on a number of proposalsthat may lead to amendments. In accordance with a directive in section336(a) of EPCA, the Commission hereby affords interested persons the opportunityto present their views orally at a public hearing. Those interested inparticipating in a hearing should notify the Presiding Officer, in writing,by no later than July 13, 1988, at the following address: Henry B. Cabell,Presiding Officer, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, DC 20580.A. Proposed Amendments to Energy Usage Disclosure for Furnaces<ITAG tagnum="81">1. </ITAG>Background: Current Furance Labeling RequirementsSection 324(c) of EPCA mandates that two disclosures appear on labels.The first is the estimated annual operating cost of the product. The secondis a range of estimated annual operating costs for comparable products.An alternative measure of energy consumption (instead of operating cost)may be used if the Commission determines that the disclosure of estimatedannual operating costs is not economically feasible or that labeling withenergy costs is not likely to assist consumers is making purchasing decisions.During the promulgation of the original Rule, the Commission concludedthat, for home heating and cooling equipment (which includes room air conditioners,central air conditioners and furnaces), the disclosure of energy usagerequired by andSection; 305.11(b) of the Rule should be in the form of anenergy efficiency rating instead of an estimated annual cost of operation.The Commission reached this conclusion because the use of these appliancesdiffers widely due to the variety of climate conditions in the United States.Therefore, a meaningful average energy cost for the operation of theseproduct categories would be very difficult, if not impossible, to quantifyon a national basis.The energy efficiency rating disclosures for these products are derivedthrough the DOE test procedures and are independent of climatic effectson energy usage. Cost information must still be disclosed, but not as theprimary energy usage disclosure. It appears in the form of cost grids belowthe primary EER disclosure on the room air conditioner label.For furnaces, the Commission determined that energy efficiency and costinformation was too complex to disclose on a label and, therefore, wasnot likely to assist consumers in making purchasing decisions.\6\<NOTE/> Further, because consumers often buy from contractors andare unlikely to see specific furnace units before purchase, the Commissiondetermined at that time that labels on furnaces would not be an effectivedisclosure format. Instead, the Commission required the EER and cost informationto be disclosed on a separate energy fact sheet instead of on a label attachedto the product. A different type of label containing general energy-savingtips (instead of energy usage information) and referring the consumer tothe fact sheet must be affixed to each furnace.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ To communicate energy-usage information, including associatedcosts, relating to a ``family'' of similar furnaces with the same basicstructure and capacity (differences stemming from various ignition systems,burners or venting techniques) would have required a much larger labelthat was likely to be confusing to consumers.The fact sheets show the various combinations of components available \7\<NOTE/> and the overall efficiency of any set of component combinations.In addition, the fact sheets provide cost grids for estimating what that``system'' could cost the consumer to operate, depending on geographiclocation and utility rate structures.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ For example, whether the furnace would be available witha vent damper, standby pilot, automatic ignition, etc.The specific requirements of andSection; 305.11(b)(3) of the Rule are thateach fact sheet must show:<ITAG tagnum="15">The name of the manufacturer or private labeler;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">The model number of the furnace;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">The capacity of the furnace;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">The EER of the furnace;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">The applicable ranges of comparability;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Placement of the particular furnace on the range scale;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Yearly cost information; and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">A statement that costs and EER's are based on standard governmenttests.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Retailers must make fact sheets available to customers at their placeof business. If retailers make sales away from their place of business,they must show fact sheets to their customers before the sale.For central air conditioners, the Commission recently adopted a differentlabeling format. The labels on central air conditioners contain the primaryenergy disclosure, the EER, and its associated comparability range. Theyalso direct consumers to <T3>either</T3> fact sheets <T3>or</T3> directories for detailed cost information. The Commission nowbelieves that this alternative disclosure system may be an efficient wayto provide energy information for furnaces.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. The Directory Option Amendment</ITAG>The proposed directory option for furnace manufacturers is identical towhat the Commission is allowing for central air conditioner manufacturers.Under this option, manufacturers would comply with the Rule's disclosurerequirements by listing required information in a trade association directory,rather than on fact sheets. This option was proposed by the Gas ApplianceManufacturers Association (GAMA) \8\<NOTE/> and others during a rulemaking proceeding initiated in 1981to consider whether two new types of furnaces \9\<NOTE/> should be included under the Rule's coverage. The Commissionrejected GAMA's proposal because it went beyond the scope of the rulemaking,which was conducted for the sole purpose of determining whether the twonew types of furnaces should be covered under the Rule.\1\\0\<NOTE/> For reasons detailed below, the Commission believes thatGAMA's proposal now merits serious consideration and publishes a proposedamendment to implement it.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ The Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association is one ofthe two trade associations representing members of the furnace manufacturingindustry. The other principal furnace industry trade association is TheHydronics Institute, Berkeley Heights, New Jersey.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ Pulse combustion furnaces and condensing furnaces. TheNotice of Proposed Rulemaking was published at 46 FR 38105 (July 24, 1981).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ 52 FR 46888 at 46894 (Dec. 10, 1987).At the time of this proposal, GAMA was about to launch a voluntary certificationprogram for furnace manufacturers. The program, which has since been putinto effect, is open to all manufacturers of residential-size furnaces.The program involves participating manufacturers submitting to GAMA energyefficiency information derived from tests performed by using the DOE testprocedures. GAMA conducts verification testing and maintains an internalenforcement mechanism.\1\\1\<NOTE/> The program also includes the publication and distributionof a Directory listing participating manufacturers along with the DOE test-derivedefficiency and annual cost information on each of the models they produce.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ GAMA has randomly selected appliance models tested byan independent laboratory to ensure the accuracy of reported energy efficiencyinformation. In addition, if one GAMA member challenges the validity ofanother member's energy usage figures in the Directory, GAMA will investigateand determine whether the claimed results are accurate. If they are inaccurate,GAMA will publish the corrected figures in the next issue of its Directory,together with the inaccurate figures they replace. GAMA will also notethat the rerating is done involuntarily, if such is the case.GAMA contended that this Directory would be superior to the existing factsheets as an energy usage disclosure system because it would contain informationon the majority of models available in the marketplace. This, GAMA suggested,would enable consumers to compare, in one booklet, the various efficiencesand estimated energy costs of many models without having to amass a collectionof fact sheets from different retail outlets. GAMA indicated that the comparabilityranges for furnaces would appear in the front of the Directory in the formpresently published by the Commission in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. In addition, the ranges would be broken downas to furnace type. For example, there would be separate ranges for horizontalor outdoor types of furnaces.GAMA also suggested that the required labels on individual furnace unitscould direct consumers to the Directory for efficiency and cost information,rather than to fact sheets. GAMA would distribute the Directory to allGAMA members in quantity, and would make reference copies available toall public libraries.\1\\2\<NOTE/> For consumers and others, the Directors would be availableat their production cost to GAMA, which was estimated at around $5 a copy.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\2\ A GAMA Newsletter mailed in May, 1986, indicates thatDirectories are currently being mailed to all public libraries, includingbranches.GAMA contended that this plan would represent a significant potential savingsto the industry in production costs of fact sheets. During the rulemakingto include additional furnace types, GAMA estimated that its cost of producingthe Directory would be equal to the cost to one fair-sized manufacturerof producing all its required fact sheets.To assist manufacturers and the Commission's staff, GAMA also offered toact as a central collection agency for all required submissions of dataunder andSection; 305.8 of the Rule. Under this plan, manufacturers submittest results to GAMA. GAMA uses the information to prepare the Directoryand submits the information to the FTC.\1\\3\<NOTE/> Participants in the program include the manufacturers ofoil-fired furnaces and boilers as well as manufacturers of gas-fired products.Electric furnace manufacturers have not elected to participate in the programor the directory.\1\\4\<NOTE/> Manufacturers who choose not to submit information to GAMAare still required, under EPCA and the Commission's Rule, to submit therequired information directly to the Commission.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\3\ The Commission's staff agreed to this proposal andaccepts the GAMA Directory as a submission under andSection; 305.8 for allparticipating members.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\4\ GAMA has informed the staff that it could accommodaterequests from manufacturers wishing to include their electric furnacesin GAMAs certification program, which includes the directory.In sum, GAMA contended that its proposal, if adopted, would:(1) Provide consumers energy usage information on the majority of availablefurnace models in one document;(2) Simplify the data collection and range publication job; and(3) Result in savings to the industry, and, hence, to consumers.The Commission's staff originally believed that this alternate proposalfell short of the plan for the dissemination of energy information envisionedin EPCA. In the August, 1983 Furnace Staff Report, staff noted the followingobjections:(1) The proposal did not provide for a Directory in every retail outlet;(2) The proposal envisioned a one-time listing of all the ranges of comparabilityat the front of the Directory. This did not provide for a disclosure ofeach individual product's efficiency on the scale, as required by the Commission'sRule;(3) Staff was concerned that enforcement problems could result as the resultof errors in the Directory attributable solely to GAMA;(4) The Directory could potentially confuse consumers by virtue of itssheer bulk. Since products would be listed by manufacturer, rather thanby effeciency, consumers would need considerable skill to use such a Directory;(5) Since participation in the GAMA program would be voluntary, fact sheetswould still be an option. Staff was concerned about the lack of uniformitybetween these two types of disclosures.In commenting on the Furnace Staff Report, GAMA contended that it has modified,or plans to modify, the Directory to respond to some of these concernsand that some other concerns are not well-founded. For example, GAMA plannedto add a feature to the Directory that would enable consumers, by meansof an explanation and directions in the front of the Directory, to placea furnace on an efficiency range scale provided in the Directory. Accordingto GAMA, this feature, which has been included in Directories in the meantime,helps consumers evaluate furnaces. GAMA also contended that the Directoriesare well distributed. It noted that 20,000 copies of the Directory werebeing provided annually. Further, in 1986, GAMA began distributing copiesthrough the public library system. GAMA also disagreed that the Directorywould be too voluminous for consumers to deal with, and stated that allthe information provided on the many products listed was useful and meaningfulto today's increasingly sophisticated consumers.The Commission's review of the Directory indicates that, with the new directionsGAMA provides, the Directory is easier to use and, particularly with theassistance of a salesperson, is likely to be an efficient way for consumersto compare furnaces. Further, since the majority of manufacturers are participatingin GAMA's program, the concern regarding uniformity because some manufacturerswill have fact sheets has substantially abated. Further, the Directorydoes not appear to pose any special or difficult enforcement issues. GAMA'sverification program and internal enforcement mechanism make it likelythat errors or misrepresentations will be identified quickly. Further,because the Directory is published semi-annually, errors can be correctedwithin six months of their appearance. Consequently, in view of the changesGAMA has made and other changes GAMA has indicated a willingness to make,such as including the Commission-published ranges in the Directory, theCommission is proposing to amend the Rule to include the directory option.The proposed amendment includes two minimum distribution requirements_(1)Distribution to substantially all furnace sellers and (2) distributionto others at cost. These requirements parallel the central air conditionerdirectory option requirements.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Product-Specific Labels  </ITAG>In addition to the directory option, the Commission is proposing to modifythe disclosure requirements for furnaces to require labels like those nowrequired for central air conditioners. Central air conditioners must beara label that (1) shows energy efficiency information that is specific tothe product to which it will be attached, (2) shows a ``generic range''(discussed below) for all central air conditioners, instead of a rangefor products of a size similar to the labeled model, and (3) contains strongerlangauge referring consumers to fact sheets or a directory for additionalinformation. The label does not contain a cost grid, but directs consumersto a directory or fact sheets for cost information. This differs from thelabel presently required for furnaces, which merely contains general energy-savingtips and refers consumers to the facts sheets for specific energy usageinformation. The Commission chose this different labeling scheme for centralair conditioners to ensure that consumers would have at least minimum energyinformation, even if they never saw the fact sheets. The Commission isproposing that the type of label that is now mandatory for central airconditioners be required for furnaces.  In lieu of the current ``energy-savings tips'' label, each proposed furnacelabel will show the EER of the specific furnace model to which it is attached.(The Commission, however, seeks comment on alternatives to disclosing justthe EER of the specific model. For example, whether several EER's couldbe displayed on the range indicating various features available, whichwould allow that label to be used on all the relevant models). Directlybelow the EER, the label will contain a ``generic'' range of EER's for<T3>all</T3> furnaces that use the type of fuel (gas, oil or electricity)used by the labeled model, rather than the range for models of a similarcapacity, as the Rule presently requires (on fact sheets).\15\<NOTE/> According to the energy efficiency data the Commission hasreceived and published, as well as the DOE engineers responsible for promulgatingand maintaining the energy usage test procedures, there is roughly thesame spread of efficiencies throughout all the various capacities. Thus,a single range for any given fuel type encompassing this spread, ratherthan ranges for fourteen sizes or capacity groupings, is sufficient toinform consumers of what efficiencies they can generally expect to find.Finally, like the central air conditioner labels, the furnace labels wouldcontain stronger language referring consumers to fact sheets or directoriesfor further information regarding efficiency and operating costs.\16\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\15\There would be three ``generic'' ranges: one for all furnacesfueled by gas, one for oil-fueled and one for electric furnaces. Thesethree ranges would replace the forty-two ranges presently required_fourteenranges, according to capacity rating (in Btu's per hour produced), foreach of the three fuel types. This proposal preserves the benefits of theRule while simplifying label printing and reducing its paperwork burden. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\16\The presently required furnace labels suggest that consumersask for fact sheets, while the proposed labels would use the language ofthe central air conditioner labels:  <ITAG tagnum="28">Federal Law requires the seller or installer of this appliance tomake available a fact sheet or directory giving further information regardingthe efficiency and operating cost of this equipment. Ask for this information. </ITAG>Thus, under the proposed amendments, to the extent that consumers shoppingfor furnaces may see display models (if not the specific models they wouldobtain), they would always see the minimum information required by EPCA(that is, the EER of the product and range information).\17\<NOTE/> Further, because the labels state that the availability ofadditional information is required by Federal law, the proposed labelswill increase the likelihood that the additional cost information requiredby the Rule will be seen by consumers. To the extent that consumers donot see a labeled model before purchase and are not provided required informationon fact sheets or in a directory, the fact that the labels can be seenpost-sale could aid the Commission's enforcement efforts. Consumers seeingthe information on the label post-sale would learn that certain informationwas not made available to them pre-sale. This may lead to complaints thatwill help the Commission identify non-complying sellers.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\17\Because many consumers may not see actual furnace unitsprior to purchase, the proposed rule requires that the EER and range informationappear both on the label and in fact sheets or directories. For the samereason, the Commission proposes to amend similar provisions of the currentrule pertaining to central air conditioners to require that both the EERand range information appear on the label and in fact sheets or directories.(Because the range information appears on the labels for central air conditioners,the Commission did not require that range information be duplicated infact sheets or the directory.) The Commission solicits comments on whetherthe proposed amendment mandating provision of duplicate range informationfor furnaces and central air conditioners will provide greater net benefitsto consumers than the provision that the range information appear onlyon the label.For the reasons stated above, the Commission is proposing two amendmentsrelating to furnaces: (1) That furnace manufacturers be afforded the optionof being listed in an industry directory instead of preparing fact sheets;and (2) that furnaces bear product-specific labels like those requiredfor central air conditioners, which will include (a) the EER of the product,(b) information on the range of energy efficiency for all furnaces thatuse the same type of fuel as the labeled model, and (c) stronger languagereferring consumers to either fact sheets or a directory for additionalinformation. In addition to seeking comments on the merits of the proposedamendments, the Commission requests information regarding whether, andto what extent, the proposals will reduce the paperwork or other burdensassociated with the Rule.B. Proposed Amendment Creating Generic Ranges for Room Air ConditionersAs just mentioned in connection with the discussion of product-specificlabels for furnaces, the Commission is proposing that the Rule be amendedto require ``generic'' ranges for furnaces, instead of fourteen rangesper fuel type, according to capacity rating.\1\\8\<NOTE/> The energy efficiency range information the Commission hasanalyzed and published indicates that generic ranges would also be appropriatefor room air conditioners. The DOE engineering staff confirms this view.Because there would be only one range for these products, instead of thirty-five,the paperwork burden associated with labeling these products should bereduced significantly. Consequently, the Commission is proposing to amendthe Rule to create a single generic range encompassing the efficienciesof all room air conditioners.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\8\ The energy usage disclosure scheme recently promulgatedby the Commission for central air conditioners and heat pumps also includesgeneric ranges for the same reasons.The Commission solicits comments on this proposed amendment and the extentof the possible reduction in paperwork burden that will result from theinclusion of generic ranges for room air conditioners. The Commission alsoseeks comment on whether generic ranges or a reduction in the number ofranges (for example, where there are many ranges for a product, whetherthe two smallest, or two largest, categories should be combined) for otherproduct categories would be appropriate, and, if so, whether such a reductionin the number of ranges would reduce the compliance burden of small entities.C. Other Issues on Which Comment is SoughtThere are several additional changes that industry members and others havefrequently suggested. To obtain more information on and to determine theextent of interest in these proposals, the Commission is seeking commenton the six issues described below. In addition, the Commission is solicitinginformation on whether to expand the Rule's coverage to include a categoryof products for which the Department of Energy has recently developed testprocedures, and information on the effects, if any, of newly enacted federalminimum efficiency standards for appliances. Finally, the Commission isseeking comment on any issues of fact, law or policy that the public maybelieve has a bearing upon the proposed amendments or any other possiblechanges to the Rule.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Energy Usage Descriptor or Labels</ITAG>As previously mentioned, for five categories of appliances, the ApplianceLabeling Rule requires a disclosure of energy cost information on labelsand in retail sales catalogs.\1\\9\<NOTE/> The cost information must be disclosed as the estimated annualdollar cost of operation. This cost disclosure must be based on standardizedtest procedures developed by the Department of Energy.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\9\ These are: refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers, dishwashers,clothes washers and water heaters.The Rule also requires that each required label for these appliance categoriesshow a range of estimated annual costs of operation or efficiencies forall models of a size or capacity comparable to the labeled model.\2\\0\<NOTE/> The ranges are published annually in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> if the upper or lower limits of the range changeby 15% or more from the previously published range. If a revised rangeis not published, a notice must be published that the prior range is stillapplicable for the next year.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\0\ For the five products for which the main energy usagedescriptor is expressed in dollars, the range figures also must be expressedin dollars. The dollar cost information that is obtained by following theDOE test procedures is derived by using National Average RepresentativeUnit Costs for energy which, as required by section 323(b)(2) of EPCA,DOE must develop and provide to manufacturers. These energy cost figuresare incorporated into section 305.9 of the Commission's Rule.Industry members and others have frequently contended that the use of adollar figure as the primary disclosure (or ``descriptor'') of energy usageis confusing and inappropriate.First, although most appliance models do not change every year (a typicalproduct line may change once every three years), DOE's energy cost calculationschange annually because of changes in fuel costs. If this change affectsthe upper or lower limits of the ranges by 15% or more, new labels arerequired. Consequently, identical appliances may have labels showing differentcosts of operation, depending on when they were manufactured. For example,a floor model may show an operating cost and range of costs that are differentfrom the cost and range on an identical, but newer unit delivered to theconsumer's home from the warehouse. Similarly, if more than one model isdisplayed from a product line, it is possible that identical floor modelscould display different labels; or, models with different features couldhave labels based on different cost figures, making it difficult for averageconsumers to compare their energy usage. This is likely to be confusingto consumers as well as retailers. In addition, during the Regulatory FlexibilityAct rulemaking, some manufacturers commented that, as a result, some dealershave had to sell floor samples with ``outdated'' labels at a discount.Second, when DOE's representative energy costs have changed, but the rangesremain in effect for more than one year (because the ranges have not changedby more than 15%), some consumers, who are familiar with energy cost information,may think the cost information on the labels in inaccurate.\2\\1\<NOTE/> Therefore, consumers may be reluctant to use the informationin making purchasing decisions. It has already been the case with someappliances that the ranges have not changed for several years in a row.Because the ranges are unchanged, the labels remain the same. This meansthat the earlier DOE cost figures are still used to compute the cost disclosuresfor these products.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\1\ Unfortunately, some industry members and consumer groupshave reported that it appears consumers are reacting to ``out-of-date''labels by not using the information in their purchasing decisions, eventhough the labels are not designed to provide exact cost information (theyare designed to provide information with which to compare similar products).For products presently labeled with the estimated dollar cost of operation,an alternate energy usage descriptor based on the DOE test procedures maybe kilowatt-hours used, or therms used, or both, depending on whether electricityor natural gas or both is consumed when the product is run.\2\\2\<NOTE/> For oil-fueled water heaters, a gallon descriptor may bemore appropriate. Like an energy factor, such as the EER for furnaces,room air conditioners and central air conditioners, the kilowatt-hour,therm or gallon usage of a product remains constant unless the energy usagecharacteristics of the product change. However, unlike an EER, with a kilowatt-hour,therm or gallon disclosure, the cost of operating the specific productcan be calculated when the per kilowatt-hour, therm or gallon cost is known.General cost information using these terms is already contained in thecost grid.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\2\ Refrigerators and freezers run on electricity. Clotheswashers and dishwashers, while they run on electricity, consume hot water(when being tested under the DOE tests) and the energy used to heat thewater accounts for approximately eighty percent of the energy use of theproduct. The labels for these products already contain two energy descriptors_onebased on the dollar cost with an electric water heater and the other fora gas water heater. Under the proposal, the two sets of dollar figureswould be replaced with kilowatt and therm figures. Labels on water heaterswould express energy in terms of kilowatt-hours, therms or gallons (foroil-fueled units).To obtain more information about this issue, the Commission solicits commenton whether, and to what extent, the use of the estimated annual dollarcost of operation as the primary energy usage descriptor on labels underminesthe credibility and usefulness of the labels to consumers when energy costshave changed, but the labels have not. To what extent does this place additionalburdens or costs on manufacturers or retailers? Would another way of disclosingenergy usage information_for example, kilowatt-hour, therm or gallon usageor an energy factor_convey information more effectively to consumers thanthe dollar cost disclosure does? If so, what disclosure method would bemost appropriate, and would it be compatible with the applicable DOE testprocedure?<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Product Categories</ITAG>Under the current Rule, product categories have been established for thevarious covered products in the appendices to the Rule, which list theranges of comparability.\2\\3\<NOTE/> For example, there is only one category for refrigerators,one for refrigerator-freezers, one for freezers, and one for room air conditioners.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\3\ The specific sub-categories for all covered productswere established by the Commission in consultation with DOE (see AppendicesA through G to 16 CFR 305).It has been frequently suggested by various manufacturers, trade associationsand others that these categories are too general and all-inclusive, andthat consumers would receive better and more precise information if specificsub-categories were created for refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers, freezersand room air conditioners. For example, for room air conditioners, insteadof one set of ranges for all these products, ranges have been suggestedfor window units, for built-in units, for casement units, etc. For refrigerator-freezers,separate ranges have been suggested for products with partial automaticdefrost and for products with fully automatic defrost. Although this proposalwould increase the number of types of labels that would have to be produced,it could assist consumers for facilitating comparison shopping for theparticular type of appliance desired.In order to gather more information on this subject, the Commission asksthe following questions: Would dividing refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers,freezers and room air conditioners into several more sub-categories, forexample, manual defrost, semi-automatic defrost, and automatic defrostfor refrigerator-freezers, chest and upright for freezers, and window units,built-in units and casement units for room air conditioners, assist consumersin considering energy consumption aspects of their purchasing decisions?If so, what subcategories should be established? Would the possible benefitsof this proposal outweigh any additional burdens (please describe or quantify,if possible) it would entail?Would such a division encourage energy conservation? If so, how?<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Label Adhesion Strength</ITAG>Section 305.11(a)(4)(i) of the current Rule specifies the paper stock andminimum peel adhesion capacity of labels for covered products. In additionto requiring that adhesive labels be applied ``* * * so they can be easilyremoved without use of tools or liquids, other than water,'' this sectionrequires that label adhesive must have ``* * * a minimum peel adhesioncapacity of 24 ounces per inch width.''Some industry members have commented that this second specification istoo high, thus making the labels too difficult to remove, and that a betterapproach would be either to eliminate this specification or reduce theadhesion capacity figure.The Commission would like to have comment on whether the minimum peel adhesioncapacity for labels set forth in andSection; 305.11(a)(4) of the Rule shouldbe lowered. If so, what should the minimum peel adhesion capacity be? Isthere a performance standard that could be used in lieu of a specifiedminimum peel adhesion capacity?<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Directory Option for Water Heaters</ITAG>GAMA has suggested that the ``Directory Option,'' which the Commissionis proposing as an option for manufacturers of furnaces, be made availableto manufacturers of water heaters. Appropriate changes to the labelingrequirements for these products also would have to be considered in conjunctionwith this proposal. For example, the current labels, which contain theestimated annual cost of operation, range information and a cost grid,could be replaced with labels with less information and a reference toa directory for additional information.The Commission solicits comment on whether amending the Rule to give manufacturersthe option of replacing the current label with one that provides no energyusage information, or limited information, but directs consumers to anindustry directory would increase the likelihood that consumers would bemade aware of the energy usage of these products. Would this proposal reducethe costs of complying with the Rule, and if so, to what extent?<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Labeling Display Models Only</ITAG>The Maytag Company has suggested that the Rule be amended to permit manufacturersof covered products to label only display models. The Commission viewsthis proposal as limited to display models in retail outlets. Appliancessold as part of new homes would all have to be labeled: it would not besufficient to label only the appliances in a model home. The purpose ofthis proposal is to reduce the burden and cost to manufacturers of labelingall units while providing the public with the information required by theAct. The Commission has interpreted EPCA as requiring all models of coveredproducts to display a label containing the energy usage information requiredby the statute, and, accordingly, the Rule implementing the Act requireseach unit to be labeled.\24\<NOTE/> In order for the Rule to be changed, the statute would haveto be amended. Under section 6(f) of the Federal Trade Commission Act,the Commission can prepare special reports to Congress and submit recommendationsfor additional legislation.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\24\ Section 324(c)(1) states that ``* * * a rule prescribedunder this section shall require that <T3>each </T3>covered product in the type or class of covered productsto which the rule applies bear a label which discloses * * *.'' (emphasisadded).Before determining whether to begin this process, the Commission seekspublic comment on whether an option to label display models only wouldprovide the same, or greater, net benefits to consumers as do labels onall units. How should ``display models'' be defined?Would such an option reduce the paperwork burden or other costs of compliancewith the Rule?How could manufacturers assure that all display models were labeled properly?If this amendment were adopted, should the legal responsibility for complianceremain at the manufacturer level or should it be shifted to the retailerlevel? If legal responsibility were shifted to the retailer level, howwould this affect the Commission's ability to enforce the Rule?Would retailers be willing to accept legal responsibility for assuringthat all display models are properly labeled?<ITAG tagnum="81">6. Proposal to Include Certain Unvented Heaters</ITAG>EPCA requires that the Commission prescribe labeling rules for any productsfor which the Department of Energy (DOE) has published a final test procedureto determine energy usage.\25\<NOTE/> Section 324(a)(1) of EPCA provides that the Commission shallprescribe labeling rules for the categories of products that include unventedheaters. However, under section 324(b)(5), the Commission can exempt suchproducts from the labeling requirements, if labeling would not be technicallyor economically feasible. But, even products exempted from the Commission'slabeling requirements must be tested according to DOE test procedures inorder to make energy claims.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\25\ Under section 323(a) of EPCA, DOE is directed to promulgatetest procedures for measuring the energy usage of 13 enumerated productgroups, including unvented heaters.Because DOE has published a final test procedure for unvented heaters (or``space heaters'' that do not vent combustion gases to the outside) usingnatural gas, propane and kerosene,\26\<NOTE/> the Commission is considering labeling these products. (TheCommission previously considered labeling electric space heaters, for whicha DOE test procedure was available earlier, and exempted these products.)Because these products are not vented to the outside and all the heat producedas the result of fuel utilization remains in the area being heated, theyare virtually 100% efficient. In addition, they are not major users ofenergy, which suggests that comparative information on the cost of energyconsumed may be of little use to consumers.\27\<NOTE/> The economic benefit from labeling these products may notjustify the cost and, therefore, be economically feasible. The Commissionhas previously exempted products from EPCA's labeling requirements on thisbasis.\28\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\26\49 FR 12148 (March 28, 1984). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\27\This distinguishes these products from electric furnaces,which are major users of electricity. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\28\For example, the Commission exempted electric space heatersbecause the benefits to consumers of labeling these products did not outweighthe additional costs to industry members and consumers and, therefore,was not economically feasible. The cost of testing and labeling was foundto be substantial and would increase the products' cost by about 3%. Theevidence also did not indicate that labeling would provide informationenabling consumers to make more informed decisions because these productsare essentially 100% efficient in producing heat and operate with littlevariation in energy costs. 44 FR 66466 at 66468 (Nov. 19, 1979). The Commission seeks comment on whether (and, if so, why) unvented oil,gas or kerosene heaters fall within the statutory exceptions discussedabove. If the Commission were to require labeling for unvented oil, gas and keroseneheaters, what labeling format and measure of energy efficiency or usagewould be appropriate for these products? What would be appropriate sizeor capacity groupings for these products for purposes of establishing rangesof comparability? <ITAG tagnum="81">7. The National Appliance Energy Conservation Act </ITAG>On March 17, 1987, the President signed the National Appliance Energy ConservationAct (NAECA),\29\<NOTE/> which establishes minimum efficiency standards for a numberof categories of appliances, including the appliances covered by the Commission'sRule.\30\<NOTE/> NAECA provides that the existing DOE test procedures, whichare used by the industry to comply with the Commission's Rule, will beused to determine compliance with its efficiency standards, and that thestandards program will be administered by DOE. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\29\Pub. L. 100-12, 101 Stat. 103 (1987). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\30\In addition to the appliances either covered by or exemptedfrom the Commission's Rule, NAECA also covers pool heaters. The standards, which take effect at staggered intervals by appliance typeover the next four years, will have differing effects on the various categoriesof appliances. For example, for dishwashers and clothes washers, the standardwill require that each model be equipped with a switch that enables consumersto bypass the extra water heating function or the drying function. Sincecompliance merely requires the installation of a switch, few, if any, modelsof these appliances are likely to be eliminated from the marketplace. Toachieve the standards for the other categories, however, significant engineeringmodifications may be necessary. The possible elimination of some of the appliance model population at thelower end of the efficiency scale (or higher end of the operating costscale), as well as the resultant contraction of the ranges for some appliancecategories (even if for only a few years), calls into question whetherthe Commission's Rule informing consumers of energy usage differences amongthe remainder will continue to be useful or justifiable in its presentform for all the presently covered appliance categories. The Commission is interested in receiving any comments on whether the Commission'sRule should be repealed or modified in light of NAECA. Specifically, theCommission seeks comment on what effect NAECA's standards will have onthe various appliance categories covered by the Commission's Rule. Willa change in appliance models have a bearing on the Rule's ranges of comparability,or on the usefulness of comparative energy usage information in the formpresently required by the Rule? Will any such effects be modified overtime and, if so, how? Assuming that one of the results of the standards will be that fewer applicanceswill be available for some categories, due to the failure of some modelsto meet the minimum standards, are there any product categories that willbe so significantly and permanently affected that the Rule should be amendedto modify the ranges for these products or to exclude them altogether?\3\\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\1\ As mentioned earlier, Congress provided, in section324(b)(1) of EPCA, that the Commission could exempt from coverage productsin categories 1-9 if labeling is not technologically or economically feasible,and products from categories 10-13 for the same reason or, alternatively,if labeling would not be likely to assist consumers in making purchasingdecisions. The categories, as enumerated in section 322(a) of EPCA, are:(1) Refrigerators and refrigerator-freezers; (2) freezers; (3) dishwashers;(4) clothes dryers; (5) water heaters; (6) room air conditioners; (7) homeheating equipment, not including furnaces; (8) television sets; (9) kitchenranges and ovens; (10) clothes washers; (11) humidifiers and dehumidifiers;(12) central air conditioners; and (13) furnaces.Section A_Invitation toComment    All interested persons are hereby notified that they may comment on anyissue of fact, law or policy that may have bearing upon the proposed rules.Written comments should be addressed to Henry B. Cabell, Presiding Officer,Federal Trade Commission, Washington, DC 20580; they will be accepted untilJuly 28, 1988. To assure prompt consideration, comments should be identifiedas ``Appliance Labeling'' and furnished, when feasible and not burdensome,in five copies.  While the Commission welcomes comments on any issues that may have bearingupon the proposed rules, there are questions that appear at the end ofthe discussions of each issue mentioned upon which the Commission particularlydesires comment. All comments and testimony should be referenced specificallyto either the Commission's questions or the section of the proposed rulesbeing discussed. The issues of particular interest to the Commission concerningthe proposed amendments are identified in the discussion of the amendmentsin Part II, A and B of the Notice. Other issues upon which the Commissionis particularly interested in receiving comments are in Sections C, E andF of the Notice.  The Commission requests that commenters provide representative factualdata, in lieu of anecdotal experiences. Individual firms' experiences arerelevant to the extent they typify industry experience, in general, orthat of similar-sized firms. Comments opposing the proposed rules or specificprovisions should, if possible, suggest a specific alternative. Proposalsfor alternative regulations should include reasons and data that indicatewhy the alternatives would better serve the purposes of the proposed rules.Comments should be supported by a full discussion of all the relevant factsand/or be based directly on firsthand knowledge, personal experience orgeneral understanding of the particular issues addressed by the proposedrules.  Before adopting these proposed rules as final rules, consideration willbe given to any written comments timely submitted to the Presiding Officerand on the record of the hearing, if one is held. Comments submitted willbe available for public inspection in accordance with the Freedom of InformationAct (5 U.S.C. 552) and Commission Regulations, on normal business daysbetween the hours of 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. at the Public Reference Room130, Federal Trade Commission, 6th and Pennsylvania Ave. NW., Washington,DC 20580.Section B_Public Hearings  Persons desiring a public hearing on the proposed amendments should notifythe Presiding Officer by no later than July 13, 1988. If there is interestin a hearing, it will take place in Room 532 of the Federal Trade Commission,Pennsylvania Avenue at Sixth Street, Northwest, Washington, DC, at a timeand date that will be announced in a subsequent notice. If a hearing isheld, persons desiring an appointment to testify will be required to submitto the Presiding Officer a complete statement in advance. This will beentered into the record in full. However, as a general rule, oral statementsshould not exceed ten minutes. There will be no opportunity for interestedpersons to cross-examine witnesses. Further instructions to witnesses willbe contained in the notice announcing the hearing.Section C_Motions or Petitions  Any motions or petitions in connection with this proceeding must be filedwith Henry B. Cabell, the Presiding Officer, who is responsible for theorderly conduct of the proceeding and who shall have all powers necesaryto that end, including the authority to rule on all motions or petitionsfiled.  Applications for review of a ruling will not be entertained by the Commissionprior to its review of the record unless the Presiding Officer certifiesin writing to the Commission that a ruling involves a controlling groundfor difference of opinion and that an intermediate review of the rulingmay materially advance the ultimate termination of the proceeding or thatsubsequent review will be an inadequate remedy.Section D_Post Comment Period or Hearing Procedures  Interested persons will be afforded 20 days after the close of the hearing,or the close of the comment period if no hearing is held, to file rebuttalsubmissions, which must be based only upon identified, properly cited mattersalready in the record. The Presiding officer will reject all submissionsthat are essentially additional written comments, rather than rebuttal.If a hearing is held, the 20-day rebuttal period will commence when thefinal transcript of the hearing is placed on the public record by the PresidingOfficer.  After the close of the rebuttal period, staff will analyze the evidenceon the record and prepare and submit a recommendation for the final rule.Section E_Regulatory Flexibility Act  The provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act relating to an initialregulatory analysis (5 U.S.C. 603-604) are not applicable to this documentbecause it is believed the amendments, if promulgated, ``will not havea significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities''(5 U.S.C. 605).  The proposed amendments relating to energy usage disclosures for furnaceswill not have a significant impact because the two proposed changes arelikely to offset each other. To the extent that manufacturers will haveto prepare the product-specific labels, instead of the labels presentlyrequired, they will incur somewhat greater printing expenses. This willbe offset, to some extent, by the fact that they will be able to availthemselves of the option to disclose required information in an industrydirectory and not prepare fact sheets. Overall, there will most likelybe a diminuation of printing expense to firms of all sizes.  The proposed amendments relating to the creation of generic ranges forroom air conditioners will not have a significant impact because the amendmentswould result in the same reduction in compliance burden to all affectedindustry members with no imposition of additional cost. The reduction ofthe number of room air conditioner ranges from thirty-five to one willmean far less variety in labels produced, which will translate to a savingsin compliance cost.  Because these changes are not likely to have a significant impact on asubstantial number of small entities within the meaning of the RegulatoryFlexibility Act and the rules implementing it, a regulatory analysis isunnecessary. If the comments on the other issues raised in this Noticelead to proposed amendments, the Commission will consider whether an analysisunder the Regulatory Flexibility Act is necessary.  The above conclusions are based on information presently available to theCommission and its staff. The Commission requests any information thatwould bear on the question whether the amendments proposed today wouldhave a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.Subsequent to the receipt of such comments, the Commission will decidewhether the preparation of a final regulatory flexibility analysis is warranted. In light of the above, it is certified, under the provisions of section5 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), that the proposedregulations, if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities.Section F_Paperwork Reduction Act  The Appliance Labeling Rule contains disclosure and reporting requirementsthat constitute ``information collection requirements'' as defined by 5CFR 1320.7(c), the rule implementing the Paperwork Reduction Act (``PRA''),44 U.S.C. 3501-3520. In 1984, the Rule was reviewed and assigned OMB ControlNo. 3084-0069. This reduction would be due primarily to allowing furnacemanufacturers to use the directory option instead of distributing factsheets. Because the proposed changes to the Appliance Labeling Rule modifyexisting labeling and recordkeeping requirements, they have been submittedto the Office of Management and Budget for review as required by andSection;1320.13of the PRA rules. The Supporting Statement submitted to OMB estimates thatthe adoption of the proposed amendments would reduce the paperwork burdenof the Rule by 6,500 burden hours, or approximately 5%. Comment on theinformation collection aspects of the proposed amendments should be addressedto: Don Arbuckle, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Officeof Management and Budget, New Executive Office Building, Room 3228, Washington,DC 20503. Copies of the Request for OMB Review under the Paperwork Actmay be obtained from: Public Reference Branch, Room 130, Federal TradeCommission, Washington, DC 20580.Section G_Proposed Amendments  <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 305_[AMENDED]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 305.11 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">[Amended]  </ITAG>1.
