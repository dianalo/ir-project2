In a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Chicago-based Continental, which was bailed out by federal banking regulators in 1984, agreed to reclassify $425 million in losses as loan losses instead of a loss on the sale of loans.    The seemingly technical argument doesn't change Continental's net loss for 1984 of $1.09 billion. But the reclassification, according to the SEC, makes it clearer that Continental itself was to blame for the loss, not the terms of the extraordinary $4.5 billion bailout it received from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. As a result of the improper classification, &quot;the commission believes that . . . criticism was deflected about Continental's stewardship.&quot;    As part of the FDIC bailout, Continental immediately in September 1984 transferred $3 billion face amount of poor-quality loans to the agency in return for $2 billion. To write down those loans by about $1 billion, Continental set aside about $565 million for loan losses and about $425 million for the loss on the sale of loans. At the time, Continental officials said much of that $425 million charge was because many loans being sold, though largely collectible, were at lower-than-market interest rates.    The SEC said yesterday that the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which regulates the company's Continental Illinois National Bank andamp; Trust Co. unit, had ordered a $950 million loan-loss provision, and to call nearly half of that amount something else was &quot;materially misleading.&quot;    In a statement, Continental said it believes its initial accounting was proper.    The banking concern settled the administrative proceedings without admitting or denying that it had violated any accounting or reporting provisions of securities law. Contrary to what one SEC official said yesterday, Continental wasn't censured by the commission.    The settlement concludes a major SEC investigation, begun in August 1982. Among other things, Continental agreed to comply with the securities laws and to include a summary of the proceedings in its fiscal 1986 report and certain future filings. </TEXT></DOC>
