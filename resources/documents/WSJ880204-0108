The recent declaration by Democratic Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia that the U.S. should consider developing a limited defense against nuclear weapons is one of those cases when the President might not care who takes the bows. The important thing is that a leading Democrat has finally endorsed the concept of nuclear defense.    Ideally, of course, it'd be worth hoping that Senator Nunn would emerge as the new Senator Arthur Vandenberg. In the 1940s, the Michigan senator led his Republican Party (and the U.S. Congress) away from its traditional isolationism, forging a consensus with President Truman on the need to contain Soviet expansionism. Today it is the Democratic Party that suffers from a strain of highly partisan isolationism. Both the party and the country would benefit if a prominent Democrat led Congress back to some new agreement of principles on defense and foreign policy.    Senator Nunn's statement doesn't go that far, but it's certainly better than anything we've heard lately from, say, Speaker Jim Wright's House of Nicaraguan envoys. In a speech last month to the Arms Control Association, Mr. Nunn took a step away from obstructionist Democratic opposition to President Reagan's defense initiative; he recommended that the U.S. &quot;seriously explore the development of a limited system for protecting against accidental and unauthorized launches.&quot;    Mr. Nunn was even more heretical, for a congressional Democrat, in acknowledging that the Soviets are working on their own strategic defenses -- &quot;an area in which they have current operational experience and near-term technical advantages.&quot; He also called for continued research on a few technologies, especially lasers and particle beams, which offer hope for a more complete defense in the longer term.    Senator Nunn seems to be conceding the sensible point that both offense and defense ought to play a role in U.S. nuclear policy. He's also conceding that nuclear defense makes sense even if it's a less-than-perfect shield. Right now, of course, the U.S. could do little more than watch and count the casualties from even an accidental enemy launch. By a &quot;limited system,&quot; Senator Nunn seems to mean a ground-based defense of missile interceptors; a test of such an interceptor worked perfectly in the early 1980s.    Now, it's also true that Senator Nunn is too quick to dismiss the potential of one promising technology, a space-based interceptor, which might allow partial SDI deployment by the mid-1990s. The technology may indeed turn out not to be cost-effective, as Mr. Nunn insists, but we won't know unless we research and test it. Senator Nunn also still insists on agreeing with the Soviets that the 1972 ABM Treaty prohibits most SDI tests in space. But now he at least is conceding that some kind of strategic defense can be developed anyway, without violating the treaty, and that in any case treaty disputes can be renegotiated.    Senator Nunn seems to be saying that strategic defense may be inevitable. He probably recognizes that Americans like the idea of protection against the Apocalypse, so he can't be happy that the Democratic presidential candidates are denouncing SDI as a &quot;fantasy,&quot; even as the GOP contenders support it. No doubt President Reagan also wouldn't mind if Senator Nunn did decide to be the Democrats' Vandenberg, even if it meant sharing the credit for strategic defense. </TEXT></DOC>
