In the seven months sincepro-choice candidates defeated their pro-life opponents inVirginia and New Jersey gubernatorial races, columnists fromcoast to coast have cited the pro-choice &quot;majority&quot; as thoughthe matter is settled. National Abortion Rights Action Leagueexecutive director Kate Michelman coined the conventionalwisdom in the wake of last year's pro-choice electionvictories: &quot;If you're out of touch with the pro-choicemajority, you're out of office.&quot;   That's a nice soundbite, but surveys show public opinionis considerably more complex and ambivalent, not just on themorality of abortion, but on its legality as well. Atwo-thirds &quot;pro-choice majority&quot; can be shown to exist onlywhen abortion is framed broadly as an issue of personalfreedom.</LP><TEXT>   When asked whether abortion should be allowed by law invarious specific circumstances, a majority of Americans saysthat in many cases it should not be. And the cases whereAmericans would restrict abortion -- when the woman's chiefreason for abortion is that the potential child would grow upwithout its father, or that it would strain the woman'sfinancial resources, or disrupt her career, education orrelationship with the father -- comprise the vast majority ofabortions that are performed in the U.S.   In June 1989, shortly before the Supreme Court'srestrictive decision in Webster v. Reproductive HealthServices, a CBS/New York Times survey asked whether abortionshould be &quot;legal as it is now,&quot; legal only in extreme cases(rape, incest or threat to the life of the woman) or entirelyillegal. Some 45% of the adults interviewed favored thestatus quo, but 39% favored allowing abortion only in theextreme cases and another 12% favored outlawing italtogether.   That 51% majority for sharp restrictions dropped by threepoints in a post Webster survey of the same respondents amonth later, creating a 48-48 split between those who favoredthe status quo and those who favored restrictions. In itswritten analysis of the poll, CBS heralded similarlynear-equal splits on two other questions about abortion as&quot;evidence of movement towards a more pro-choice consensus.&quot;But this &quot;consensus&quot; proved short-lived: The percentagefavoring sharp restrictions bounced back to a 53-43 advantagein a CBS/Times poll two months later.   The most specific questions about abortion have been putin a series of surveys by KRC Communications Research, whichpolls for the Boston Globe and the San Francisco Examiner. Ina KRC survey last year, before Webster, majorities said thatabortion should not be legal in cases where the grounds forit are economic or emotional strain, an uncooperative orabsent father or the woman's sense that it is the wrong timein her life to have a child. Five months after Webster, KRCfound a rise in pro-choice sentiment. A bare plurality(statistically a tie) now favored legal abortion when thewoman's reason was that she could not afford to bear a child,but majorities still opposed it when the grounds cited werethe father's absence or unwillingness to help raise thechild.   Pennsylvania and Idaho, the two states whose legislaturespassed extensive abortion restrictions in the wake of Webster(Idaho's legislation was vetoed by Gov. Cecil Andrus), havebeen depicted in the media as exceptional pro-life bastions.But last December, when KRC asked voters across the countrywhether they would like their states to adopt laws similar toPennsylvania's, an overwhelming majority said yes. This year,KRC found that 48% of Americans would approve of their stateadopting a law similar to the Idaho bill that &quot;outlawsabortion except in the cases of rape, incest, profound fetaldeformity or if the life of the mother is threatened,&quot; whileonly 43% would oppose it.   The point is not that there is a pro-life majority. Thatconclusion would be no more accurate than the converse.Indeed, when confronted with KRC's national finding on theIdaho restrictions, pro-choice activists rightly noted thatif the phrasing of the question were changed, the resultswould probably change as well.   Perhaps the most revealing approach is to let people statetheir views on abortion in their own words. Just afterWebster was handed down, American Viewpoint, a Republicanpolling company, asked voters to name &quot;the one thing youwould like your state representative to keep in mind whendiscussing and voting on&quot; abortion. The most frequently citedtheme in the responses was a woman's right to choose,mentioned by 36%. Overall, 54% offered pro-choice answers.But the share of respondents who gave one anti-abortionresponse or another, plus those who stressed that abortionshould be legal only in certain cases, totaled 48%. (Thetotal exceeded 100% because some responses covered twothemes.)   Linda DiVall, who directed the American Viewpoint survey,noted that pro-choice sentiment formed a large, ready-madebloc, while the anti-abortion responses were diffuse. Pullingthe latter group together while minimizing the focusedhostility of the former group is no doubt an uphill battlefor a pro-life candidate. But if a pro-life candidate couldhold all his potential supporters together, the voters wouldapparently split almost evenly. This is why pro-choiceactivists avoid debating specific restrictions, according toCelinda Lake, a Democratic pollster who works for pro-choicegroups.   Pro-choicers who resist acknowledging voters' ambivalenceshould be reminded that one-dimensional images of publicopinion hurt their cause too. Consider: The abortionrestrictions most likely to be approved by state legislaturesin the wake of Webster are not outright bans, but tighterregulation of abortion clinics. The media have widelyreported polls that purport to show that large majoritieswould favor laws to require parental consent, viabilitytesting, a pre-abortion waiting period and a full briefing ofthe woman on options other than abortion. But last July CBSfound that when these restrictions are described collectively-- as &quot;laws that would make it difficult for private clinicsto perform abortions&quot; -- a majority opposes them. Isn't thelatter finding as significant as the former?   Rather than discrediting each other, these snapshots ofpublic opinion, taken from different angles, can combine toflesh out a multidimensional image of public opinion. RecentCBS polls illustrate this nicely. Last fall nearly 70% ofadults agreed with the statement, &quot;even in cases where Imight think abortion is the wrong thing to do, I don't thinkthe government has any business preventing a woman fromhaving an abortion.&quot; In the same survey, a bare 48% pluralityagreed that &quot;abortion should be available for those whoreally want it, but it should not be easy to get.&quot; InNovember, when asked which of three statements best expressedtheir views, 41% chose to say abortion should be &quot;generallyavailable,&quot; and an opposite 15% felt it &quot;should not bepermitted,&quot; but 42% chose positions favoring legal abortionwith &quot;stricter limits&quot; than the status quo.   The result is a triply qualified hypothesis: Two-thirds ofAmericans believe abortion generally should be decided by thewoman, but most think it should not be allowed in the lesssevere circumstances; and despite widespread reluctance toenforce the law in such cases, about half want barriers todiscourage women whose motives are less than compelling.That's a lousy soundbite, but a good stab at what the publicreally thinks.   ---   Mr. Saletan is editor of the Hotline, an electronicpolitical news service.</TEXT></DOC>
