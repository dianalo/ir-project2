The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday refused to hear Eagle-Picher'schallenge to a decision by a federal appeals court in Philadelphiathat the government enjoyed sovereign immunity and thus was immuneto lawsuits for negligence from use of asbestos products.   ``Obviously we're disappointed, but it will in no way affect ourother pending lawsuits against the government,'' said J. RodmanNall, an Eagle-Picher representative.   Eagle-Picher, which has been inundated with damage claims frompeople who say they suffer from cancer and asbestosis because oftheir exposure to asbestos in the company's pipe compound, hassimilar negligence suits pendiing against the U.S. government infederal courts in Seattle and Washington, D.C.   ``We think as conflicts develop between the courts, the SupremeCourt will hear one of these cases,'' Nall said.   During the military buildup that followed World War II,Eagle-Picher was enlisted by the government to make a pipe jointcompound containing asbestos for use in ship-building.   Asbestos was found to be linked to a number of respiratoryailments and Eagle Picher quit making the asbestos-laden compound inthe early 1970s. Claims filed against the company by shipyardworkers and their families seek damages totaling in the millions ofdollars.   Eagle-Picher contends the federal government should bear someresponsibility for the asbestos-related claims because it mandatedthe use of the product and routinely violated its own occupationalsafety and health rules.   ``The Navy insisted on the use of asbestos insulation aboardships. It alone knew the extent of the danger and told no one,'' thecompany wrote in a position paper supporting its arguments.   ``Companies, enlisted in the war effort, were told precisely theformula for the insulation and how much asbestos fiber it had tocontain. ... The problem was created by the Navy itself for it setthe rules for handling the material and then broke them withoutnotice or warning,'' the company said.   While challenging the government position in court, Eagle-Picheris also trying to get Congress to pass laws making the governmentliable.   The company got legislation introduced in the last session ofCongress that would override the doctrine of sovereign immunity andmake the government accountable for actions and decisions just asother employers who control working conditions that affect workers'health are.   The legislation was introduced in the House of Representatives byWillis Gradison, a Republican, and Thomas Luken, a Democrat, both ofCincinnati. The measure had 70 co-sponsors.</TEXT></DOC>
