Engines with an odd number of cylinders are rare, primarily becausethey vibrate more. Honda's design dampens the engine's vibration partly byusing hydraulic devices at points where the motor is mounted on the carframe.;    The five-cylinder engine gets 26 miles to the gallon in highwaydriving, and 19 in the city -- about 10 percent less than the Accord'sfour-cylinder engine.;    Honda said it chose a five-cylinder engine for theVigor because it wanted more power than a four-cylinder engine but lacked roomin the engine compartment for six cylinders.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  New York Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Detroit  </CITY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910329  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  11D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  193  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday March 29, 199100089075,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
