Formulae suitablefor practical algorithm computer presentation are obtained. During thefield reconstruction physical calculation program parameters are corrected,their error and the reconstructed field error are calculated. Algorithmpossibilities as applied to the RBMK reactor are manifested. It is concludedthat the use of complete volume of apior information provides maximalaccuracy of heat release field determination. Therewith even at suchdiscreteness as in RBMK (one detector for 14 channels) the field reconstructionerror for all channels will not exceed the measurement error. Any representationroughening of calculation-experimental divergence covariant matrix resultsin increase of the error. 36 refs.; 4 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
