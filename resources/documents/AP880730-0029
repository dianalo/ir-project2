Lawmakers are considering legislation to keep the trains rolling.   The United Transportation Union said it will strike Thursday ifCandamp;NW adopts new work rules eliminating jobs for 1,156 UTU brakemen.   However, neither side can act until a cooling-off period orderedby President Reagan ends at 12:01 a.m. on Aug. 4.   In his order, which also blocked an April walkout and created anemergency board to intervene, Reagan said a strike against Candamp;NWcould deprive several Midwestern states of essential rail service _and disrupt business in the Chicago area, where 40,000 commutersuse its trains daily.   Negotiators for the company and Cleveland-based union met lastMonday and Tuesday at National Mediation Board headquarters inWashington but made no progress. As of Friday, no further talkswere scheduled.   ``For almost two years, we've been planning how we would operatein the event of a strike,'' said James Foote, vice president ofcommunications for CNW Corp. in Chicago, the railroad's parentcompany. ``We're ready.''   ``They didn't get what they wanted, so they don't intend to talkand intend to promulgate all the things they wanted on Aug. 4,''UTU President Fred Hardin said. ``If they take that position, thatleaves us no alternative but to peacefully withdraw from service.''   On July 1, the presidential emergency board proposed acompromise: that Candamp;NW eliminate one brakeman per train and theother if approved by an arbitrator on a train-by-train basis. Bothsides rejected the plan.   The railroad operates on 6,400 miles of track with 8,000employees in Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri,Nebraska, South Dakota, Wisconsin and Wyoming.   It ranks eighth among U.S. railroads in revenue, generating$893.5 million last year by moving 1.7 million carloads of freight.   ``We've cut our work force, cut expenses and improved ourproductivity dramatically,'' Foote said. ``But because ofcompetition and lower rates, our revenue per car has declined 26percent since 1982.''   Candamp;NW wants to save $51 million a year by cutting most of itstrain crews from four to two people, eliminating what it considersunnecessary brakemen's jobs and leaving an engineer and conductoron board.   ``We've made agreements in good faith with all the othercarriers since the 1970s to cut down to one conductor and onebrakeman on each crew and negotiate for the other brakeman,'' saidHardin, whose union represents both brakemen and conductors. ``IfCandamp;NW were to win _ we have a strike and they're victorious _ thenthey'd have an unfair advantage over the other railroads.''   Foote said it might take an act of Congress to bring asettlement, a sentiment echoed by Hardin, but neither the companynor union want a solution being proposed on Capitol Hill. They havespent the last few days lobbying against it.   A bill introduced by Rep. John Porter, R-Ill., would make thepresidential board's recommendations binding unless the partiesreach agreement without a strike.   The chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee'stransportation subcommittee, Rep. Thomas A. Luken, D-Ohio, said themeasure would get prompt attention if there is no settlement byThursday.   ``This would be a crippling strike for commuters and manyagricultural interests, especially in these drought-strickentimes,'' Luken said. ``It's premature for us to consider any actionunless and until there would be a strike, but we intend to be in aposition to move very quickly.''   Hardin said he was not sure yet if the UTU would extend a striketo other carriers, and he did not know if Candamp;NW employees from 15other unions would walk off the job in sympathy.   ``If it's a legal strike, our people would,'' said Jim Shell,vice president of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers inCleveland. ``That's a matter of personal choice, whether a membercrosses their picket lines or not, but this organizationtraditionally has honored legal strikes.''</TEXT></DOC>
