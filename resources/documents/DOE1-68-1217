<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-68-1217 </DOCNO><TEXT>Geothermal energy is discussed from Canadian and global perspectives.A brief history of geothermal exploration and energy utilization is given,and the world's main geothermal fields are described. The origin of geothermalenergy in the earth's crust is explained, and the mechanisms by whichit becomes accessible to the surface environment - including explorationtechnology - are outlined. Geothermal resources in Canada are described,from the low-temperature sedimentary reservoirs of the East, Arctic andWestern Basin to the high-potential areas in the Rocky Mountains andCoast Ranges. As yet the geothermal resources of Canada are not welldeveloped, hence only a few current projects are included in this report,notably the exploration and development program at Mount Meagher in BritishColumbia. 14 refs., 15 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
