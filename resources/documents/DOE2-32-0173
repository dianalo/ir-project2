The ionization efficiency data have been treated bydeconvoluted first differential technique. First and higher appearanceenergy values for the ion are reported. The heats of formation for theions obtained from benzyl alcohol, benzyl amine and benzyl cyanide arefound to be less than 1274, 1293 and 1221 kJ mol/sup -1/, respectively.Kinetic energy release values associated with fragmentation of metastable(C/sub 7/H/sub 6/)/sup +/ ions suggest that these ions undergo loss ofH from three different structures or mixtures of structures.
