SchlenderStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 06/01/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> SUNWCOMPUTERS (EDP) </IN><DATELINE> MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.  </DATELINE><TEXT>    Sun Microsystems Inc. willannounce today products that will allow its workstations tobe used as intermediary systems between mainframes,minicomputers and personal computers.   The new products include SunLink, a package of hardware and software that enables a Sun workstation to connect directly into an International Business Machines Corp. mainframe computer, providing high-speed communications capable of transmitting three million characters a second, the equivalent of 1,500 double-spaced, typewritten pages. This means SunLink, which will be available in August and will cost about $20,000, can support a network of as many as 128 workstations entering simultaneous transactions.    The other major product is an enhanced version of TOPS, a software that enables IBM personal computers and Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh personal computers to share data. The new version, produced by Sun's recently acquired Centram Systems West Inc. unit, will translate data from Apple and IBM computers into a form usable by Sun workstations, mainframes and even supercomputers. Sun hasn't set a price for the new version, which will be available in the third calendar quarter.    The new products are &quot;designed so that a user can get to all of his company's computer resources from his desktop system, without having to know the idiosyncrasies of every machine on the network,&quot; said Scott McNealy, Sun's president and chief executive officer.    According to Eric Schmidt, Sun's vice president and general manager of software products, the products also &quot;allow Sun's workstations to be used in many more situations than previously accessible,&quot; namely conventional business settings. Up to now, Sun's workstations have been used mainly as computer-aided design tools, or for professional photo-typesetting. In its five-year history, Sun has sold about 36,000 workstations.    To make its workstations more attractive to conventional businesses, Sun recently lowered the price of its least-expensive workstation by 37% to $4,995, in an attempt to begin competing directly in some markets now dominated by personal computers. Sun's workstations, which usually are sold in networks of five or more, provide larger screens, fancier graphics and number-crunching abilities than most personal computers. Common business applications software, such as spreadsheets, accounting, database systems must be written for Unix, a standard operating system developed by American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. that Sun uses in its workstations, before Sun can hope to sell many workstations as general business machines.    Meanwhile, with easier access to personal computers and mainframes that the new products provide, Sun hopes its workstations will come to be used as &quot;gateways for high-performance interplay with other systems,&quot; said Mr. Schmidt.
