Will MIS reassertitself and demonstrate the value of centralized responsibility forinformation resources, or will decentralization accelerate with corporatenetworks breaking up like so many Baltic states? Can individual departmentsor-as some advocate even smaller entities such as workgroups effectivelynegotiate interconnectivity within a larger, more &quot;democratic&quot; framework?andM;There are obvious precedents-and advantages-for each approach.andP;  Corporationshave benefitted from handing computing responsibility out to individualdepartment chiefs.andP;  More conscious of the bottom line and better aware ofapplication requirements, these managers have purchased systems andconstructed networks well-suited to the needs of their users.andP;  Frequently,these users can maintain their own systems more cost-effectively byoutsourcing support services or hiring consultants to handle complexconnectivity issues.andM;On the other side of the LAN, however, lies the philosophy that informationsystems should be a general corporate resource-a basic service available tothe entire company.andP;  Supporters of this approach argue that scatteringresponsibility for implementation and maintenance of information systemsthroughout an organization leads to unnecessary duplication of effort andunbalanced technology development.andP;  Industry standards may solve some ofthese problems, but truly integrated information networks are possible onlythrough a high degree of centralized planning-and that requires a strong MIS.andM;For better or worse, money will probably decide the question of centralizedplanning.andP;  It will also determine the future of MIS.andP;  Companies willing toforego significant technology upgrades or imprudently reduce computerspending through draconian budget cuts may save money in the short term onlyto find themselves swamped with connectivity problems in the long run.andO;Spending money to bring older systems up to date or achieve enterprise-wideintegration may look extravagant right now when every dollar counts, but itcould, in the longrun, provide the means for a stronger recovery.andM;Don MarksandM;HP PROFESSIONAL</TEXT></DOC>
