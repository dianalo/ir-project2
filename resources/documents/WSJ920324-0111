Conran's is a unit of Storehouse PLC, a troubled Britishretailer. In recent years the chain has faced stiffcompetition from a host of aggressive, well-funded retailers,including Ikea AB, a Swedish concern that operates huge,low-cost stores in the U.S., and Crate andamp; Barrel, Northbrook,Ill.</LP><TEXT>   According to people familiar with the situation, thebuy-out would be led by Conran's management team here,including Martin Burke, president and chief executive officerof Conran's Habitat USA. Mr. Burke, 38 years old, declined tocomment. He is a former executive at R.H. Macy andamp; Co. and washired by Storehouse in July 1990 to turn around Conran'sbusiness in the U.S.   Conran's generates an estimated $100 million in revenueannually, and analysts say it isn't currently profitable.Analysts estimated that the chain could bring $20 million to$40 million, depending on the value of its store leases.   Conran's opened in 1977 in the U.S. with considerablefanfare. Shoppers applauded the store's adventurouspresentation of home furnishings, particularly its kitchenutensils, plates, glassware and other homerelatedaccessories.   By the mid-1980s, however, it was becoming clear thatConran's missed the opportunity to become a dominant force inthe home furnishings market. Retail observers say that thestore began to lose its image with upscale consumers, andthat business went into a steep decline.   &quot;They were very hot when they opened in New York, but Idon't think their business ever translated well outside ofManhattan,&quot; said Budd Bugatch, a furniture industry analystfor Ferris, Baker Watts, Inc., based in Baltimore. Mr.Bugatch said the best-selling items never carried big profitmargins, and the company's pricier furniture lines didn'thave broad appeal.   Until the past 18 months, the merchandise and displaylacked new ideas, colors and patterns, and prices wereclimbing, said Alan Millstein, a retail consultant. Sincethen, Conran's has shown steady improvement, he said.   According to those familiar with the retailer, Mr. Burkehas closed nonperforming stores, installed new computers andput new inventory into the remaining stores. Conran's isscheduled to open three new stores by the end of May,including units in McLean, Va.; Burbank, Calif.; and LosAngeles.</TEXT></DOC>
