The statement, in a speech by Deputy National SecurityAdviser Robert Gates, is the first time the administrationhas said so clearly it intends to use economic pressure totry to expel the Iraqi president.</LP><TEXT>   The declaration means the U.S. intends to go beyond theterms laid out in a United Nations cease-fire resolution thatformally ended the allied war to force Iraqi troops out ofKuwait. That resolution allows the gradual lifting ofsanctions if Iraq meets requirements for making warreparations and dismantling its programs for producingchemical, biological and nuclear weapons.   But the administration appears to be in position to makegood on its effort to keep the sanctions in place even ifthose conditions are met. Any decision to lift sanctions mustbe made by a unanimous vote of a special U.N. committee, andthe U.S. has a seat on that committee.   Saddam Hussein &quot;cannot be redeemed,&quot; Mr. Gates said inremarks prepared for delivery to the American NewspaperPublishers Association's annual convention in Vancouver,British Columbia. Mr. Gates added that Saddam Hussein's&quot;leadership will never be accepted by the world community,and, therefore, Iraqis will pay the price while he remains inpower. All possible sanctions will be maintained until he isgone. Any easing of sanctions will be considered only whenthere is a new government.&quot;   The administration's declaration doesn't appear to affectshipments of food to Iraq. The U.N. cease-fire resolutionallowed immediate resumption of food shipments, as well assales of some Iraq oil on the world market to raise money topay for food shipments. But the U.S. position seems likely tostop Iraq from resuming regular sales of its oil, the sourceof virtually all of Iraq's hard-currency income.   Administration officials had been suggesting in privatefor several weeks that they would adopt such a stance onsanctions. Mr. Gates's speech makes the use of sanctions toeffect a political change in Iraq a formal policy goal.   An attempt to keep economic sanctions on Iraq indefinitelycould cause some problems for President Bush down the road.For now, other members of the U.N. Security Council favorkeeping sanctions in place, and U.S. war allies also areinclined to keep the economic pressure on Saddam Hussein.   But that unity could break down over time. Europeandiplomats have warned privately, for instance, that publicsentiment for lifting sanctions could build if it appearsthat the Iraqi people are suffering more than their leadersfrom the economic pressure.</TEXT></DOC>
