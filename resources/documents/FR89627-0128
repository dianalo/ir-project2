Background</ITAG>The HMTA (49 App. U.S.C. 1801 et seq.) at section 112(a) (49 App. U.S.C.1811(a)) expressly preempts ``any requirement, of a State or politicalsubdivision thereof, which is inconsistent with any requirement'' of theHMTA or the HMR issued thereunder.Procedural regulations implementing section 112(a) of the HMTA and providingfor the issuance of inconsistency rulings are codified at 49 CFR 107.201through 107.211. An inconsistency ruling is an advisory administrativeopinion as to the relationship between a state or political subdivisionrequirement and a requirement of the HMTA or HMR. Section 107.209(c) setsforth the following factors which are considered in determining whethera state or local requirement is inconsistent:(1) Whether compliance with both the state or local requirement and theHMTA or HMR is possible (the ``dual compliance'' test); and(2) The extent to which the state or local requirement is an obstacle tothe accomplishment and execution of the HMTA and the HMR (the ``obstacle''test).Inconsistency rulings do not address issues of preemption under the CommerceClause of the Constitution or under statutes other than the HMTA.In issuing its advisory inconsistency rulings concerning preemption underthe HMTA, OHMT is guided by the principles enunciated in Executive Order12612 entitled ``Federalism'' (52 FR 41685, Oct. 30, 1987). Section 4(a)of that Executive Order authorizes preemption of state laws only when thestatute contains an express preemption provision, there is other firm andpalpable evidence of Congressional intent to preempt, or the exercise ofstate authority directly conflicts with the exercise of Federal authority.The HMTA, of course, contains an express preemption provision, which OHMThas implemented through regulations and interpreted in a long series ofinconsistency rulings beginning in 1978.<ITAG tagnum="84">2. The Application for Inconsistency Ruling</ITAG>On May 17, 1989, the DON, through Lawrence L. Lamade, its General Counsel,applied for an inconsistency ruling concerning the Oakland Nuclear FreeZone Act, which is reproduced in Appendix A to this Notice.In its application, DON, prior to discussing specific provisions of theOakland Nuclear Free Zone Act (Ordinance), describes the scope of the Ordinance.DON states that this Ordinance applies to the transport of any nuclearweapon or hazardous radioactive material and that the scope of the Ordinanceis evidenced by its stated purpose to ``make Oakland a nuclear free zone.''DON stresses that the Ordinance addresses the transportation of nuclearweapons or other hazardous radioactive materials through, or over, Oaklandand that it applies to <T3>all</T3> hazardous radioactive materials, regardless of their classificationunder the HMR. Section 11.g. of the Oakland Ordinance defines ``HazardousRadioactive Materials'' as: <ITAG tagnum="21">* * * any radioactive isotope(s) resulting from the operation of,or intended for use in, nuclear fission reactors or nuclear weapons; therefined products of spent nuclear fission reactors, or of any device orcomponent of a device that has been used to contain or process radioactiveisotopes; or the tailings or similar debris resulting from the mining ofuranium or other radioactive elements except as specifically exempted herein.</ITAG>However, DON points out that Subsections 12.h and i. exempt (1) nuclearmedicine research programs, (2) ``unclassified'' research, study, evaluationor teaching, (3) the operation of particle accelerators, (4) the constructionand operation of experimental fusion reactors, and (5) consumer uses ofradioactive material, from the provisions of the Ordinance. Because section 11.a. defines ``person'' as any ``natural person, corporation,college or university, laboratory, institution, governmental agency, orother entity,'' DON argues that the Ordinance is applicable to the activitiesand operations of both private entities and the Federal Government. Thus,says DON, the Ordinance applies to any nuclear weapon or radioactive materialwhich is generated, utilized, or transported in, through, or over the Cityof Oakland. DON contends that several provisions of the Ordinance are inconsistentwith the HMTA and the HMR under both the ``obstacle'' and ``dual compliance''tests described above. First, citing numerous prior inconsistency rulings and 49 CFR Part 177,Appendix A, DON asserts that a 45-day advance notice provision is inconsistentbecause of delays and diversions resulting therefrom. It also argues thatthe requirement for 45 days' advance notice to the City of radioactivematerials transportation is inconsistent because it applies to Departmentof Defense shipments exempt from the HMR under 49 CFR 173.7(b) and becauseit may violate the disclosure prohibitions of 10 CFR 73.21, which is incorporatedby reference in 49 CFR 173.22(c). Second, DON contends that routing requirements of the Ordinance are inconsistent.The Ordinance provides that, after a public hearing, the City Council willdetermine the safest route and means of transportation for radioactivematerials transportation. According to DON, this process is inconsistentwith the HMR's classification of radioactive materials and the routingrequirements of 49 CFR 177.825, particularly the provision for transportationof highway route controlled quantities (HRCQ) of radioactive materialson preferred routes (Interstate highways and state-designated routes).Other bases argued by DON for the alleged inconsistency of this processare the Ordinance's application to non-HRCQ radioactive materials and shipmentsexcluded from regulation by the HMR, the City Council's unfettered discretionto select routes, and delays that will result from this process_particularlyfrom a requirement that at least 15 days' public notice follow the Council'sselection of a route. Third, DON argues that the Ordinance contains an inconsistent placardingrequirement, specifically a requirement for a sign reading ``Transportationof Hazardous Radioactive Materials'' clearly visible at least 150 feetin each direction. DON alleges an inconsistency with the placarding systemof 49 CFR 172.500-558, particularly with 49 CFR 172.556 concerning radioactivematerials placarding. It cites language in Inconsistency Ruling No. IR-24(53 FR 19848, May 31, 1988) that ``HMR placarding provisions do completelyoccupy the field and, therefore, preempt all state and local placardingand warning sign requirements for hazardous materials transportation whichare not identical to the Federal requirements.''Fourth, DON cites several inconsistency rulings to support its contentionthat the following transportation ban in the Ordinance is inconsistent:``The present ban by the Port of Oakland on transportation of spent nuclearfuel rods through the Port is hereby confirmed and made permanent.'' DONstates that the authority to ban or prohibit transportation is exclusivelyFederal and quotes the following language from Inconsistency Ruling No.IR-3 (Decision on Appeal):<ITAG tagnum="21">A unilateral local ban is a negation, rather than an exercise, oflocal responsibility, since it isolates the local jurisdiction from therisks associated with the commercial life of the nation. </ITAG>Finally, DON argues that fee and criminal penalty provisions of the Ordinanceare inconsistent insofar as they apply to inconsistent provisions. <ITAG tagnum="84">3. Public Comment </ITAG>Comments should be limited to the issue of whether the requirements ofthe Nuclear Free Zone Act of the City of Oakland, California, are inconsistentwith the HMTA or the HMR. They should specifically address the ``dual compliance''and ``obstacle'' tests described above under ``Background.'' Persons intended to comment on the application should examine the completeapplication in the RSPA Dockets Branch, Appendix A to this Notice, andthe procedures governing the Department's consideration of applicationsfor inconsistency rulings (49 CFR 107.201-107.211). <ITAG tagnum="6">Alan I. Roberts, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Director, Office of Hazardous Materials Transportation. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Issued in Washington, DC, on June 20, 1989.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Appendix A_Oakland Nuclear Free Zone Act</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Section 1: Name</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This Ordinance shall be known as the Oakland Nuclear Free Zone Act.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Section 2: Purpose</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The purpose of this Act is to make Oakland a nuclear free zone by:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. Prohibiting the production of nuclear weapons in Oakland;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. Regulating the transportation of nuclear weapons and hazardousradioactive materials through Oakland, and informing the citizens of Oaklandbefore such transportation takes place;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. Banning the storage or reprocessing of hazardous radioactive materialsin Oakland;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d. Prohibiting City contracts with or the investment of City fundsin any business that knowingly engages in nuclear weapons work; and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">e. Prohibiting nuclear reactors in Oakland.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Section 3: Findings</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The people of Oakland find that:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. Nuclear weapons are an intolerable danger to humanity in generaland to Oakland in specific. In particular, they endanger the economic well-beingof the people of Oakland, the environment in which we live, and our healthand safety. The continued escalation of the arms race and threats to initiatethe use of nuclear weapons increase the likelihood of nuclear war and diminishour security.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. Even if nuclear weapons are never used, the transportation andstorage of nuclear weapons or other hazardous radioactive materials area serious threat to the health and safety of the people of Oakland. Exposureto these materials can cause cancer, birth defects and other diseases,while there is no scientific proof that any level of exposure is safe.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. Nuclear reactors pose similar threats of exposure to radioactivityfrom transport or storage of nuclear materials, routine operations, andthe inherent risk of catastrophic accidents, such as those at Three MileIsland and Chernobyl. Oakland is specifically threatened by Rancho Secoand nuclear reactors aboard Navy ships in Alameda and the San FranciscoBay.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d. The production of nuclear weapons is the major driving force ofthe nuclear fuel cycle, which includes mining, refining, nuclear reactors,food irradiation plants, waste storage, transportation and reprocessingactivities, each stage of which poses serious risks to public health andsafety. Because of the security requirements surrounding nuclear weaponsand materials, these activities also abridge our civil liberties and limitour ability to make informed decisions affecting our future.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">e. Money invested by the City of Oakland in businesses participatingin nuclear weapons work helps support the arms race, diverts funds fromneeded human services, and is not a responsible use of City funds.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">f. The people of Oakland have expressed their desire to end the armsrace. In 1983 we voted to support a bilateral freeze on ``the testing,production and further development of all nuclear weapons.'' In 1986 theCity Council voted unanimously to support a comprehensive nuclear testban.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Therefore, the people of Oakland join over 130 U.S. communities andthousands of other cities world-wide by declaring Oakland a nuclear freezone. The people of Oakland require that the City of Oakland use its legaland regulatory authority to eliminate threats to the public health andsafety due to the presence of nuclear weapons work, nuclear reactors, orhazardous radioactive materials in Oakland, and to stop making investmentsor contracts that contribute to the nuclear arms race.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The people of Oakland also call upon the Board of the Oakland SchoolDistrict, the Commission of the Port of Oakland, the Alameda County Boardof Supervisors, the Board of the Peralta Community College District, theBoards of all special districts serving the City of Oakland, and the managersof any autonomous pension funds or other investment funds of these agenciesto examine the provisions of this Act and to implement them within theirrespective jurisdictions as applicable.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Section 4: Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons Work </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">No person shall, within the City of Oakland, knowingly engage in nuclearweapons work. (See Section 11 for definitions and exclusions.)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Section 5: Transportation </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. Any transportation of nuclear weapons or other hazardous radioactivematerials through or over Oakland shall be subject to the following restrictions:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">i. Any person transporting such materials shall notify the City ofOakland at least 45 days prior to such transportation for review underprovisions of this section.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">ii. The City Council shall convene at least one public hearing withsufficient advance notice by radio, television, and press release, to ensuremaximum public participation. After hearing public testimony, the CityCouncil shall determine the safest route and means of transportation forthe above-mentioned materials. Following selection and approval of routeand means, the City shall give at least 15 days advance public notice ofthe selected route(s). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">iii. The City of Oakland shall independently monitor transport ofhazardous radioactive materials through or over Oakland and assess theadequacy of safety and notice provisions relating thereto. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">iv. Each vehicle involved in such transport shall have signs warning``Transportation of Hazardous Radioactive Materials'' clearly visible forat least 150 feet in each direction.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. The present ban by the Port of Oakland on transportation of spentnuclear fuel rods through the Port is hereby confirmed and made permanent.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Section 6: Prohibition of Reprocessing, Storage and Use </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">No person shall reprocess, store, dump, or use hazardous radioactivematerials for any purpose within the City of Oakland. (See Section 11 fordefinitions and exclusions.)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Section 7: Nuclear Weapons Free City Investment and Contracting </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. Contracts and Purchases:  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The City of Oakland shall grant no contract, direct or indirect, toany nuclear weapons maker, unless the City Council makes a specific determination,after public hearing, that no reasonable alternative exists, taking intoaccount each of the following factors: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">i.
