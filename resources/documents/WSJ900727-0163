After a six-day trial, federal Judge Charles S. Haight Jr.dismissed a shareholder's complaint that Franklin ResourcesInc. charged excessive fees for managing its $11.2 billionFranklin U.S. Government Securities Fund.</LP><TEXT>   The New York federal court's ruling is the sixthconsecutive courtroom setback for investors accusing mutualfunds of charging exorbitant fees. Wall Street has paid closeattention to the Franklin case because it is the first of itskind to go to trial involving a bond mutual fund. TheFranklin portfolio also is one of the largest funds in thebusiness.   &quot;There has never been an excessive-fee case won by aplaintiff . . . but I'm still banging my head against thewall,&quot; said Richard Meyer, the shareholder's New York lawyer(who himself lost a similar case as a plaintiff last year).He said he probably will appeal the Franklin case.   The ruling stemmed from a 1987 suit filed by Lucyle Kalishand Sol Joseph Kamen, alleging that Franklin, a big SanMateo, Calif., fund company, charged excessive fees and thatmanagement failed to fully inform the fund's directors aboutthe appropriateness of such fees.   Franklin currently charges investors 0.45% annually tomanage the fund, which grew to a high of $15 billion inassets in 1986 from $2 billion in 1984. Management feesamounted to about $65 million at the fund's peak, said DanielPollack, Franklin's attorney.   &quot;A main thrust of the plaintiffs' case is that Franklinsimply made too much money managing the fund,&quot; Judge Haightwrote. But he said his ruling followed cases that &quot;squarelyrejected a Calvinistic condemnation of joy through profit.&quot;Franklin's after-tax profit from managing the fund, which thejudge said didn't exceed 35% of revenue, was &quot;reasonable,&quot; hesaid.   &quot;Plaintiffs have failed to prove that Franklin realizedeconomies of scale as the fund increased in size, or thateconomies of scale, if realized, were not shared withinvestors,&quot; the 70-page ruling said.   Other excessive-fee cases that have gone to trial involvedmoney-market mutual funds. The new ruling shows that &quot;courtsapply the same factors irrespective of the type of fund,&quot;says James Benedict, a partner at the law firm of Rogers andamp;Wells who has handled similar cases.</TEXT></DOC>
