 To get minimal special effects, such as windowing or zooming,you first have to digitize the analog signals.andP;  A TV set must perform allsorts of electronic gymnastics just to eliminate the semars, streaks,jitters, static, and other noises of broadcast transmission.andP;  And in the end,all this heroic processing achieves is a signal far less clear and accuratethan one generated by a computer without any processing at all.andM;Replacing moribund TV technology will be digital telecomputers, connected tothe world through a network of fiber optics.andP;  Telecomputer users will be ableto dial up digital databases, programs, movies, classrooms, or news coverageanywhere on the continent and, ultimately, all over the world.andM;Such capabilities far surpass those of today's TV sets, which are dumb analogreceivers with access to a few hundred channels at most.andP;  Even themuch-ballyhooed development of high-definition TV (HDTV) will merely sharpenthe pictures of what will remain an inherently passive medium.andM;Mired in an Analog MorassandM;The conflict between the computer and the television set is not simply atechnological issue.andP;  If tomorrow's video technology is merely an improvedversion of the same through-the-air broadcast technology used since the birthof television, Japanese manufacturers will continue to dominate consumerelectronics.andP;  Japanese makers have been focusing on advanced televisiontechnologies for 20 years, and they are at least a decade ahead in thedevelopment of HDTV.andM;So be it.andP;  Far from a revolution, the HDTV system is an extension of currenttop-down television, using program input from a handful ofgovernment-licensed broadcasters (eight channels for all of Japan, forexample).andP;  The fivefold improvement in resolution offered by HDTV isimpressive only when measured by the standards of the television industry,which makes one step forward every 25 years or so and calls it a revolution.andO;Landmarks to date are monochrome television in 1923, color TV in 1950, andthe videocassette recorder in 1972.andP;  Meanwhile, between 1961 and 1989, thespeed of a computer operation increased 230,000-fold.andM;Recent innovations promise approximately a 1-million-fold rise in thecost-effectiveness of computer hardware during the very period that HDTV willenter the fray.andP;  If TV is dead, HDTV will be stillborn.andM;Television's problems cannot be overcome in any system that is compatiblewith the current television standard.andP;  TV remains mired in an analog morassbecause its broadcast signals use the scarce resources of the radio frequencyspectrum.andP;  Digitizing a high-resolution video signal multiplies its use ofthe spectrum by as much as 100 times.andP;  If the scores of existing TV channelswent digital, the spectrum would have no room left for cellular phones, CBradios, or other mobile technologies.andP;  Since its inception, TV has beenforced to accept the efficient inaccuracies of analog rather than theprodigal precision of digital.andM;The digital video information in a computer can be raised to any arbitrarylevel of resolution.andP;  The reason computers are not used today to showfull-motion video is the enormous cost of the memory and processing speedrequired to transmit millions of pixels to a screen 30 times a second.andO;Proposed HDTV systems will use about a million pixels, each requiring atleast 12 bits of information.andP;  At the standard video rate of 30 frames persecond, this resolution means a total of 360 megabits per second, which wouldrequire memories that can deliver a bit every 3 nanoseconds.andP;  Such speed ispossible, but the equipment now costs tens of thousands of dollars--farbeyond the range of consumer affordability.andM;But video compression techniques and fast memory will inevitably becomecheaper.andP;  To eclipse television technology, the digital computer needs only afew more years of learning curve pricing.andP;  At current rates of progress, agigabit of solid-state memory will cost less than $20 within ten years, andgigabytes of optical disc media will soon cost under $2.andP;  The next generationof compct discs will hold 2 gigabytes--enough for a full-motionhigh-definition movie.andP;  Sun workstations offering high-definition video arecurrently priced near $7,000.andP;  Within seven years, at the time HDTV mightbecome widely available, far more powerful video computers will cost lessthan $1,000.andM;Beyond HDTVandM;Already available in the United States are video technologies far excellingHDTV.andP;  Scores of companies--including Intel, Apple, IBM, Texas Instruments,Kurzweil Applied Intelligence, Sun, and NeXT--have begun development.andP;  Thesecompanies do not see themselves in the TV business.andP;  But if they pursue thepromise of the technology with entrepreneurial verve and vision, they willhave a greater impact on the future of TV than will Sony or Matsushita.andM;Foremost among the new telecomputer technologies is digital videointeractive, or DVI, developed by RCA's David Sarnoff Research Center and nowthe property of Intel.andP;  DVI solves a critical problem in transforming analogimages into digital data: how to store and transmit the voluminous bits.andO;With a capacity of some 600MB, CDs currently find their chief use inhigh-definition audio, which requires about 100 times less data than video.andO;With existing technology, a CD holds less than a minute of full-motiondigital video and takes some two hours to show it.andM;Three years ago, Sarnoff engineers startled Microsoft's CD-ROM conference bydemonstrating three breakthroughs: a digital compressjion system that caneffect a 100-to-1 reduction of audiovisual data, allowing storage of 72minutes of sound and full-motion video on one CD; a super-fast playbacktechnology that can produce sound and full-motion video in real time; and afully interactive graphics controller that offers a dazzling array of videoeffects for games and educational uses.andM;DVI technology promises all the image crispness of HDTV plus much more,because any frame can be randomly accessed and interactively manipulated.andP;  Ina real estate presentation, for example, the viewer could enter a 360-degreepicture and &quot;walk through&quot; a room, changing the wallpaper, moving andreupholstering furniture, even opening shades to look out the window.andP;  Atourist could visit a Third World country and view any chosen set of sceneswithout having to drink the water.andP;  An art student could walk through theLouvre, watching short biographies of selected artists or visiting particularpaintings.andM;In current TV, all the intelligence resides in the centralized broadcastingcenter.andP;  Just as the PC put mainframe power on the desktop, the telecomputerwill bring sophisticated video processing into the living room.andP;  To televisea sporting event, for example, an array of cameras would be set up at highvantage points.andP;  These cameras would provide enough video data via fiberoptics to let home viewers decide for themselves when to zoom in for aclose-up or initiate a replay.andP;  The viewer of a televised football game couldrecord it and then watch the event from any chosen vantage point on or offthe field.andM;Such performance can, of course, be reproduced by multimillion-dollarsupercomputers.andP;  What makes DVI such a breakthrough is its potentially lowcost.andP;  Intel's microchip expertise will soon reduce the entire DVI system tojust one circuit board; in volume production, the technology could be madeavailable for far less than a current high-end TV set.andM;Indeed, the most important product at Intel is not its highly hyped 486 andi860 microprocessors but its DVI chip set.andP;  For rapid compression of theimages, Intel uses a massive parallel system combining 64 microprocessors.andO;With thousands of pixels to process simultaneously, video images map well toparallel computer system.andP;  This invention represents a technological advancein video imaging that far surpasses any feature of HDTV.andM;Smashing the Status QuoandM;With its commanding leads in many of the most important computing andtelecommunications techologies, U.S.andP;  industry has every hope of dominatingthe telecomputer business of the future.andP;  The United States has thousands oftimes more computer and software companies than Japan has.andP;  The danger isthat our current governmental policy is dominated by groups whose interestsclash with the interests of the United States as an industrial power.andM;The dream of a fully digital telecomputer depends, for example, on wiringAmerican homes with fiber-optic cables.andP;  Several telephone companies areconducting trials of this technology.andP;  But politically influential mediainterests want to restrict the profits that the phone companies might earn.andO;Many cable television franchises, for example, would rather buy into Japn'sHDTV system than give up their local monopoly on electronic informationdelivery.andM;Worse, broadcasters have a huge investment in perpetuating a technology thatJapanese manufacturers will probably dominate for many years to come.andO;Perhaps the most powerful subsidy for broadcast interests is free access tothe limited resource of the radio frequency spectrum.andP;  Indeed, HDTVproponents want this subsidy expanded because, they correctly contend,transmission of the higher-quality TV picture will require additionalfrequencies.andM;Spectrum space is sorely needed by the mobile communications systems used fora variety of public needs, including police and emergency services, airtraffic control, and trucking.andP;  Since television has the far betteralternative of fiber and cable, the FCC should continue doggedly to deny TVbroadcasters additional spectrum resources.andP;  In fact, the government shouldbegin withdrawing spectrum space from TV while launching a coordinatednational drive to bring fiber optics into homes.andM;Just as desktop publishing software has led to the emergence of more than10,000 new publishing firms, new desktop video programs will allowindividuals to generate video information and entertainment.andP;  The only limitto the number of channels will be the creativity and imagination of PC users.andO;Armed with hypermedia capabilities, they will bring together the power offilms, books, and graphics in new programs.andP;  Zooming in interactively onevents and persons around the globe, the telecomputer can make the world intoa new digital village.andM;The telecomputer is coming sooner or later.andP;  The question is whether we willmake it happen for this generation or whether we want to allow Japanesemanufacturers to do it for our children.andP;  We must demand that Washington actto break down the broadcasting and cable monopolies and liberate ourentrepreneurs and telephone firms on the frontiers of fiber to the home andhypermedia for the world.andP;  The PC can finally prevail only by becoming a TVkiller.andM;George Gilder is the author of several books on economics and technology, andhis forthcoming book, Life After Television (Whittle Communications), is dueout shortly.andP;  He has been semiconductors editor of the computer industrynewsletter RELease 1.0 Gilder lives in Tyringham, Massachusetts.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
