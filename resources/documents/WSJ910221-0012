After consulting with Mr. Bush's advisers, SenateRepublicans fine-tuned the act in ways designed to make thebill more acceptable to the White House. Mr. Bush let anearlier version of the bill die in November because thatversion would have compelled him to impose trade sanctions ona number of suspected violators. Mr. Bush wants to retainother, less-confrontational options for dealing with theproblem.</LP><TEXT>   The new bill still would require trade sanctions againstviolators. But an amendment intended to meet Mr. Bush'sobjections would give him as many as 270 days to persuadeforeign governments to take corrective actions on their ownbefore the sanctions kick in. Last year's bill would haveprovided a grace period of 90 days.   The bill would reauthorize the entire spectrum of exportcontrols that the U.S. routinely exercises in order to keepsensitive technology from falling into the hands of potentialadversaries. Mr. Bush invoked his emergency powers last fallin order to allow the Commerce Department to continueadministering controls even though its normal statutoryauthority lapsed last year. The bill would give Mr. Bush astronger statutory basis for restricting weapons-relatedtrade. The administration expects soon to issue a number ofnew regulations dealing with such matters.   The bill still has to be approved by the House.</TEXT></DOC>
