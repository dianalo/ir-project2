Col. Manuel Oxales, deputy chief of the National Capital RegionDefense Command, said troops and police blocked convoys lateSaturday carrying about 1,000 civilians into Manila. He speculatedmany were supporters of Marcos, now in exile in Hawaii.   Oxales said convoy leaders planned to surround military garrisonsin the capital, much like the February 1986 ``people power''uprising that ousted Marcos and propelled Mrs. Aquino to power.Leaflets promised establishment of a ``constitutional militarygovernment,'' he said.   Police said today five people remain in custody, facing chargesof illegal assembly. Sedition charges were being prepared againstthe suspected organizer, Jose Ocampo, who remained at large,authorities said.   ``The situation now is normal,'' Oxales said. ``But the militaryis on alert to prevent any further attempt.''   Mrs. Aquino told reporters she did not consider the incident acoup attempt.   ``They were just making noises and they wanted to be noticed,''she said. ``I guess people will keep on trying (to undermine hergovernment), but I think they should realize now that the people areagainst them and they will not support them in something like this.''   Oxales said leaflets confiscated from the convoy offered rewardsof up to $200,000 for the capture of senior military officers whoremained loyal to Mrs. Aquino.   ``The armed forces of the Philippines is now taking over thegovernment,'' Oxales said, reading fromn the leaflets.   He said the participants appeared to be civilians and there wasno evidence any soldiers joined the move.   Oxales quoted participants as saying they were offered money tojoin the convoy and were told they would attend rallies at thepresidential palace and elsewhere to protest ``economic grievances.''   Participants, mostly from agricultural areas near the capital,were also given ``liberation bonds'' that could supposedly beredeemed after the new government was installed, Oxales said.   Authorities have foiled a half dozen coup attempts against Mrs.Aquino. The most serious took place Aug. 28, 1987, when about 2,000mutineers attacked military and media facilities in the capital.   At least 53 people were killed and more than 300 were wounded,including Mrs. Aquino's only son, Benigno Aquino III. Mutiny leaderLt. Col. Gregorio ``Gringo'' Honasan was arrested in December 1987but escaped last April.</TEXT></DOC>
