(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Democratic platform writers aretrying to forge common language on such issues as drugs and civilrights before tackling foreign policy and deficit questions thatcould divide the Dukakis and Jackson camps.   The party's drafting committee resumed work today on this scenicisland resort.   When the panel broke Friday, Eleanor Holmes Norton, JesseJackson's platform adviser, complained to reporters: ``It is goingtoo slowly. You don't know what differences you have until you getdown to cold language.''   But Rep. William Gray III, who is chairing the drafting effort,said he wanted the 16 panel members to get acquainted and actuallywrite the document themselves, not ``rubber stamp something thatfalls from on high.''   Gray said afterwards, ``I heard a real strong consensus on theissue of drugs, wanting ... a very strong statement on education,and an even stronger statement on civil rights.''   Gray, from Pennsylvania, said he was in no hurry to put anythingon paper before the Democrats head home Sunday.   A draft is needed by June 25-26, when the full 186-memberPlatform Committee meets in Denver for the first time, he said.   ``This process begins in Mackinac and it's going to go throughDenver ... and all the way to Atlanta, because you don't have aplatform until it's approved by the entire convention,'' said Gray,chairman of the House Budget Committee.   Democratic National Chairman Paul G. Kirk Jr. opened theMackinac meeting with an appeal to write a document that speaks toAmerican families in their kitchens, not to special interests. Kirkthen departed.   Both the Dukakis and Jackson camps were not satisfied with a2,000-word blueprint penned by Theodore Sorensen, once John F.Kennedy's speechwriter.   Michael Barnes, a former Maryland congressman representingDukakis, said the platform needs to spell out how the Democratswill deal with AIDS and the homeless.   Boston Mayor Ray Flynn, one of the drafters, said, ``Thereshould be a plank in this platform that says no person will sleepon the streets of America on grates or on park benches any coldnight.''   Norton, former chairwoman of the Equal Employment OpportunityCommission, said: ``We have made no decisions about what will go tothe floor. We're trying to get so we can draft the first word.''   Asked about reports that Jackson was getting conflicting adviceon what demands to press and how hard to fight, Norton said sheknew of no rifts, but added, ``I have to tell you, he keeps his owncounsels and makes up his own mind and everybody else really trailsbehind.''   The Sorensen paper, styled as a declaration by ``We the peopleof the Democratic Party,'' denounces ``voodoo economics,'' condemns``South Africa's hateful apartheid, government-sponsoredterrorism,'' and mentions in passing the need ``to find more homesand food for those who are homeless and hungry ... and to find moreaid for those who have AIDS.''   Norton said Sorensen's language on South Africa was ``one of thebetter parts of this document,' but still needs strengthening.   ``The motherhood issue of this campaign has been drugs. Thereprobably is more the American people would like to have us sayabout drugs,'' said Norton, suggesting a call for appointment of aCabinet-level drug czar and mobilizing the Coast Guard and militaryresources in the fight.   James B. Booe, secretary-treasurer of the Communications Workersof America and one of the drafters, said the Democrats need ``aplatform that any Democrat can run with instead of from,'' not ``alegislative laundry list.''   Booe said the platform should not ``get us tangled up with toomany specifics.''</TEXT></DOC>
