Some of the demonstrators had stayed overnight at the site afterattending a rally Thursday that police said drew 1,500 people.   The protesters at the headquarters in Takamatsu of the ShikokuElecric Power Co. opposed an output test at the company's nuclearreactor at Ikata that was conducted Friday.   Takamatsu is 340 miles southwest of Tokyo and Ikata is 115 milessouthwest of Takamatsu.   Sueaki Maekawa, a member of a local anti-nuclear group, said,``The protest action was initiated by ordinary people, such ashousewives, who have no affiliation with big organizations. It isreally encouraging.''   Police spokesman Yasunori Aya said about 300 police officerswere sent to the demonstration Friday to keep order. The protesterswere ``noisy but not violent'' and there were no arrests, he said.   A Shikoku company official said that in the test, the reactor'soutput was reduced by 50 percent over a period of three hours. Theofficial, speaking with the condition he not be identified, saidthe test was made to collect data on rapid reactor output shiftsdealing with the fluctuating demand for power.   Protesters said the test was similar to one conducted at theChernobyl nuclear power complex in the Soviet Union on April 26,1986 that resulted in a fire and the world's worst nuclearaccident. The Soviets said at least 31 people perished from thefire or radiation.   The company official said the tests were different. He said theSoviets tried to stop the turbine completely and the Japanese testonly involved a 50 percent cutback.   He said the Soviets also disconnected safety devices at theChernobyl plant, while the devices at the Ikata reactor remained inoperation.   The Kyodo News Service quoted Soichiro Ito, director-general ofScience and Technology Agency, as saying there was was no cause forconcern about the safety of the test.</TEXT></DOC>
