The offering, first announced by the oil company two weeks ago, will be made in two parts to domestic and international purchasers, Arco said.    The distribution would reduce Arco's stake in its chemical and refining unit to as little as 42.5% or as much as 50%, depending on the amount of over-allotments of stock taken by dealers, though a spokesman said Arco intends to keep its stake just under 50% and might buy back Lyondell shares to keep that level.    Arco's plan calls for 32 million Lyondell shares to be offered in the U.S., with another 4.8 million shares available for overallotments by dealers. The simultaneous international offering will consist of eight million Lyondell shares, with an additional 1.2 million shares to cover over-allotments.    Lyondell stock will be priced at between $30 and $34 a share, Arco said, indicating total proceeds of between $1.38 billion and $1.56 billion, assuming full exercise of the over-allotments -- about what analysts had projected for the sale. The totals would exceed the $1.37 billion record proceeds from a sale of 51.8 million common shares last June by Occidental Petroleum Corp.    The cash proceeds to Arco will be boosted by the company's plan to take another $500 million out of Lyondell by means of a dividend paid by Lyondell to its parent. The dividend will be financed by debt financing.    Co-managers for the domestic sale of Lyondell stock will be Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. and Salomon Brothers Inc. Their international units will co-manage the overseas offering.    Arco said it will use the proceeds for general corporate purposes, including possible extension of a $4 billion stock buy-back program and repurchase of enough Lyondell stock to maintain Arco's stake in the facility at just under 50%. Under its buy-back program, started in April 1985, Arco has acquired 62 million shares at a total cost of $3.9 million. At Sept. 30, Arco had 178.5 million common shares and common share equivalents.    Lyondell, based in Houston, was created by Arco in 1985 as part of a major corporate restructuring. Lyondell is an amalgam of a petroleum refinery and three chemical plants in Channelview, Texas, near Houston. The facilities produce ethylene, propylene and methanol, as well as gasoline and other petroleum products. </TEXT></DOC>
