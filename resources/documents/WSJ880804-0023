Subroto, the former Indonesian oil minister who became secretary-general July 1, said he will leave next week for visits to Ecuador and Venezuela, as well as to two non-OPEC exporters in Latin America, Colombia and Mexico. He said he plans to visit all members of the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries before the next cartel meeting, scheduled for Nov. 21.    Since assuming the post, which had been vacant, Mr. Subroto already has made official visits to some OPEC members, including the United Arab Emirates, a frequent violator of the cartel's production quotas. There, he won a pledge from the government that it would support OPEC's efforts to try to curb the high production that has seriously weakened world oil markets.    It was the United Arab Emirates' recent public repudiation of their OPEC quota that led to this one-day meeting yesterday of the price-monitoring committee, composed of the five leading oil ministers. Since then, a possible end to the war between two of OPEC's founding members, Iraq and Iran, had added urgency to the meeting because of fears that the two countries would need to pump more oil into an already glutted market to finance reconstruction of their damaged economies.    The five ministers are responsible for monitoring world oil prices, which have dropped more than $3 a barrel this year because of high production by OPEC. And there was almost a crisis atmosphere when the ministers opened their meeting.    First, they heard an extremely pessimistic report from OPEC's own economic experts on the recent surge in the cartel's production that has promised further deterioration in oil prices. &quot;The present trend may not be easy to reverse quickly, except by strict adherence of member countries to their allocated levels of production,&quot; the confidential internal report concluded.    But Mr. Subroto brought better news on the result of his talks with Sheik Zayed bin Sultan, president of the United Arab Emirates. According to Mr. Subroto, Sheik Zayed had emphasized his intent to &quot;support OPEC in its endeavors to stabilize the oil market.&quot;    What's more, the ministers said in a comminque issued after the meeting that an end of hostilities between Iraq and Iran would give OPEC &quot;a greater degree of cohesion&quot; and would help stabilize the oil market. The ministers also addressed several other pending OPEC issues, but delegated most of them to Mr. Subroto to work toward resolution by &quot;consultations and negotiations.&quot;    The lack of further action -- specifically, the committee's decision not to call an emergency conference of all 13 oil ministers -- didn't impress some of the crude oil traders and oil company officials who turn out for OPEC meetings. Most expect a possible further softening of oil prices before a turnaround.    But the prospect of an emergency conference remains, some OPEC delegates said yesterday. &quot;We will meet again before the November conference,&quot; Belkacem Nabi, the oil minister of Algeria, said in an interview.    The oil ministers were unanimous, however, in emphasizing what they described as a &quot;new atmosphere&quot; and &quot;spirit&quot; within OPEC. In an interview, Arturo Hernandez Grisanti, the oil minister of Venezuela, cited the &quot;concrete commitment&quot; of the emirates' president to &quot;respect OPEC decisions&quot; and &quot;the possibility of real peace in the Middle East.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
