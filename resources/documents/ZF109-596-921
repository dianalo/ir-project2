(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Erica SchroederandM;The need for multiplatform word processors is increasing as corporatenetworks become more popular and organizations move toward informationsharing among platforms.andM;Until recently, however, the only way to transfer documents across platformswas to use a word-processing document translator or ASCII conversion.andM;Both of the methods involve extra steps, converting one platform'sword-processing file into a translation format and then changing it into aword-processing file format for a second platform.andP;  A true cross-platformword processor can eliminate or at least reduce this extra work.andM;Few software developers have made DOS-compatible, cross-platform wordprocessors commercially available.andP;  Several VAX and Unix word-processorvendors have released PC versions of their products, mostly in response tobuyer demand.andM;Trajectory Software Inc., of Ridgewood, N.J., first developed its LEX PDQ forthe DEC VAX environment in 1981.andP;  A Unix version followed, and a DOS versionwas released in 1983.andM;&quot;A lot of our DEC customers were starting to get involved in Unix and thereweren't a lot of applications out for Unix at that time,&quot; said Al Bracco,Trajectory's director.andP;  &quot;We developed a Unix product in response to userrequests.&quot;andM;While ECap Systems Inc., in Castleman, Ontario, sells QTEX1T, which runs onVAX, Unix and DOS, the company focuses mainly on the VAX version.andM;&quot;We are primarily a VMS shop.andP;  We only [sell] DOS versions at $50 per packageto cover our costs,&quot; said Eric Covington, vice president of sales andmarketing at ECap.andM;Dilworth Software Inc., of Carmel, Calif., the North American distributor ofQS (known in Europe as Quick Star) presents a different cross-platformphilosophy.andM;&quot;QS was intended to be multiplatform.andP;  We immediately had it running on OS/2,DOS, Unix and CP/M 86.andP;  It was released commercially in 1986 for alloperating systems simultaneously,&quot; explained D.J.andP;  Dilworth, the company'soperations director.andM;QS now runs on Unix V, OS/2, Xenix 86, 286, 386, Concurrent DOS, CPM 86, DOS,Turbo DOS and DOS Plus, Dilworth said.andM;Only a handful of the best-known PC word processors provide genuinecross-platform compatibility, perhaps because product versions are atdifferent developmental stages on different platforms, and providingcross-compatibility is expensive.andM;WordPerfect Corp., which introduced its word processor on Data GeneralCorp.'s Ellipse in 1980, now has versions of its word processor running onthe Mac, Unix, VAX/VMS, System /370, Data General and under DOS.andM;&quot;We are putting the most emphasis on PCs.andP;  Other than that, our VAX and Unixproducts are the best sellers.andP;  We put a lot of development effort into those[platforms],&quot; said Janet Frandsen, a mini/mainframe publicist at WordPerfectin Orem, Utah.andM;Microsoft Word is available for many PC environments -- DOS, Windows 3.0,OS/2 and the Macintosh.andP;  While Microsoft Corp. has also developed Word 5.0for Unix in a joint venture with The Santa Cruz Operation Inc., the SantaCruz, Calif., software developers that markets the product, Microsoft remainfocused on the PC customer.andM;&quot;We're not [aimed at] the CAD engineering customer.andP;  Our first priority isfor the large business platforms [used by] our mainstream business users,&quot;said Jeff Sanderson, group product manager for word processing at Microsoftin Redmond, Wash.andP;  &quot;The other thing we see happening is the client/servercomputer, [with the word processor] partly on a VAX and partly on a PC, sothe appropriate type of computing is performed on the right machine.&quot;andM;&quot;Our main priorities are DOS, Mac, Windows, OS/2 and network informationsharing.andP;  We use the VAXs for hard-core number crunching,&quot; he added.andM;&quot;Clearly some flavor of graphical Unix is in the cards at some point,&quot; saidSanderson, but Microsoft is waiting until a standard version of graphicalUnix is established before developing an off-the-shelf product.andM;File compatibility is the main issue in the cross-platform word-processingarena.andP;  For the most part, vendors claim to have total file compatibilitybetween platforms.andP;  Text, styles, tabs and tables reportedly translateeasily.andM;However, graphics transfer remains difficult for two reasons: Some platforms-- mainframes and Data General machines -- have graphics limitations; andthere is a lack of VAX or Unix versions of many popular PC graphics packagessuch as ZSoft Corp.'s PC Paintbrush.andM;&quot;File compatibility is not bad, could be better, and will be better,&quot; saidSanderson.andP;  &quot;File exchange is not a perfect thing.andP;  The place where thingstend to run into the most problems is graphics, when you cut and paste fromthe clipboard.&quot;andM;But not all graphics files translate poorly.andP;  Trajectory Software's Braccosaid, &quot;LEX PDQ's file compatibility is 100 percent.andP;  You can take any file,create it in any version and use it on any other version.andM;&quot;We support HPGL files, which quite a few different products support on thePC and Unix.andP;  But if you've got a Harvard graphics chart, it's not going todo you much good on a VAX,&quot; he said.andM;&quot;We're working on getting support for scanned TIFF files.andP;  We plan to havethat in the next release, as well as direct support for Lotus 1-2-3 graphicsfile formats which are now available on the VAX and Unix,&quot; Bracco added.andM;Inconsistent versions of a word processor across various platforms can alsocreate problems for vendors.andP;  Platforms that interest a more limited group ofbuyers, such as IBM's System/370, are not agressively supported by vendorssuch as WordPerfect.andM;WordPerfect's Frandsen said, &quot;The mainframe market isn't really a growingmarket like other markets.andP;  If people are doing a lot of word processing onthe mainframe, they will combine the PC with the mainframe.&quot;andM;Dilworth estimated that his market is mostly DOS buyers.andP;  He estimates Xenix,OS\2 and Unix buyers each only account for 5 percent of his sales.andM;On the other hand, Bracco, estimated his DOS sales account for 15 percent ofhis business and VAX sales 35 percent.andP;  &quot;We sell primarily for 386 machinesrunning Unix.andP;  That's where 50 percent of our sales are concentrated,&quot; hesaid.andM;After platform limitations are taken into account, interface differences seemto be relatively slight; therefore, training on different platforms is notdifficult.andM;&quot;Most corporations just don't have the same platform for all their wordprocessing, so file compatibility is a big plus, but so is the fact that theinterface is familiar,&quot; said Frandsen.andP;  &quot;I think other vendors will be movingtoward multiple platforms, since Unix and VAX are getting really popular.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
