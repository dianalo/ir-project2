(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   George Bush on Tuesday proposedcreation of a federally supported foundation to encourage America'syouth to volunteer their help for the less fortunate.   ``I want our affluent to help our poor,'' the Republicanpresidential candidate said in a speech unveiling his proposal fora YES to America Foundation. ``I want the young men and women ofour tree-lined suburbs to get on a bus, or the subway, or themetro, and go into the cities where the want is.''   Bush blended his proposal with a dose of the liberal-bashingrhetoric that marks his campaign for the White House. He predictedthat his critics would sneer that ``a national voluntary effortjust won't be as good as a new multi-billion dollar program.''   Bush outlined his proposal for a Youth in Service to AmericaFoundation as he worked to cement support i northern California, aregion that advisers say is up for grabs in the White Housecampaign.   Bush dusted off his familiar attack style of campaigning laterin the day when he blasted ``the liberal governor of Masachusetts''at a sun-drenched rally on the steps of the Riverside CountyCourthouse in Southern California.   He said Dukakis had criticized the three-year 25 percent incometax cut enacted during the Reagan administration but promised,``I'm not going to let them take that away from us.''   He arranged a stop for later in the day in New Mexico.   Bush's Sacramento speech marked an effort to flesh out hiscampaign call for a ``kinder, gentler nation'' and also combat theDemocrats' portrayal of him as an uncaring member of the upperclass.   He said some kids have ``$40 jeans and $50 sneakers'' whileothers live ``lives of utter desolation in the poorestneighborhoods.'' One group should help the other, he said,expressing the hope that ``the work itself, the labor of love isthe reward.''   Bush said that a quarter century of massive federal spendingprograms has demonstrated that ``we can't buy our way out'' of theproblem.   Bush said he would serve as chairman of his proposed a Youth inService to America Foundation.   An aide to Bush, Deborah Steelman, said the vice presidentenvisioned a $100 million annual federal contribution for theprogram. She said the foundation would set broad guidelines forcommunity activities but local leaders would have discretion in thetypes of programs they set up. She said some activities couldinvolve payment.   Bush said current volunteer programs that work well could beexpanded and others could be created. He suggested that someparticipants would travel to the inner city ghettos to read tochildren there.   ``Some of the poor don't speak English and can't fill out formsfor their children to go to school. Some women need help and adviceon what to do about a repeatedly abusive husband. They don't knowthat there are private organizations that can help,'' he said.   ``Government, we must finally admit, isn't the answer,'' Bushsaid. ``And it isn't enough to say, `I'm a Republican and life isimperfect.'''   He conceded he may have been confusing when he spoke in hiscampaign debate of a ``thousand points of light,'' and usedTuesday's speech to explain himself.   ``In a national movement such as `Yes to America' I am saying`Add your light to the sum of light,''' he said. ``Give to thosewho cross your path and enter your life.''</TEXT></DOC>
