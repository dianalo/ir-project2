On February 2, 1988, the Office of Managementand Budget (OMB), in accordance with its authority under the PaperworkReduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3> and 5 CFR Part 1320, approved the information collectionrequirements contained in the final rule with the exception of those containedin paragraphs (m)(1)(i) through (m)(4)(ii), concerning hazard communication.OSHA resubmitted its request for approval of paragraphs (m)(1)(i) through(m)(4)(ii) and on October 7, 1988, OMB approved paragraph (m)(1)(i) forone year and paragraphs (m)(1)(ii) through (m)(4)(ii) for three years.The OMB clearance number is 1218-0145.OSHA is providing a sixty day start up period, until December 6, 1988,before it will begin enforcing the newly approved hazard communicationprovisions. During this period OSHA will consider the petition filed bythe Formaldehyde Institute and others for an administrative stay of theseprovisions pending either judicial review or a new rulemaking limited tothe provisions of paragraph (m)(1)(i).

Paperwork Approval</ITAG>OSHA published a final rule on formaldehyde on December 4, 1987 (52 FR46168). On February 2, 1988, under the Paperwork Reduction Act, OMB approvedall of the paperwork requirements of 29 CFR 1910.1048 with the exceptionof those contained in paragraphs (m)(1)(i) through (m)(4)(ii). OSHA informedthe public of this fact and of the OMB clearance number on March 2, 1988(53 FR 6628).The disapproved paragraphs contained criteria for determining when thepresence of formaldehyde constitutes a health hazard and prescribed informationthat must be included on hazard warning labels on containers of formaldehyde,and containers of certain formaldehyde-treated products as well as informationto be included in the accompanying Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs).On July 7, 1988, OSHA resubmitted its request for information collectionapproval of paragraphs (m)(1)(i) through (m)(4)(ii) of 29 CFR 1910.1048,with a more detailed justification. The entire text of the resubmissionwas printed in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on July 12, 1988 (53 FR 26329).On October 7, 1988, OMB approved the information collection requirementsin paragraph (m)(1)(i) for one year, until October 7, 1989. Paragraph (m)(1)(i)sets forth objective criteria that establish when formaldehyde constitutesa ``health hazard'' for purposes of triggering the labeling provisionsand the requirements for availability of MSDSs. At the same time, paragraphs(m)(1)(ii) through (m)(4)(ii) were approved for three years, until October7, 1991. These paragraphs prescribe the information to be included on hazardwarning labels for formaldehyde and set forth procedures for developing,updating and distributing MSDSs to accompany formaldehyde and formaldehyde-containingproducts.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Clarification of the Labeling Provisions</ITAG>Paragraph (m)(3)(i) of 29 CFR 1910.1048 requires the employer to assurethat hazard warning labels complying with the requirements of the HazardCommunication standard, 29 CFR 1910.1200(f), ``are affixed to all containerswhere the presence of formaldehyde constitutes a health hazard.'' As notedabove, paragraph (m)(1)(i) sets forth objective criteria for ascertainingwhen formaldehyde constitutes a health hazard. The hazard warning labelmust identify the hazardous chemical, list the name and address of theresponsible party, contain the information ``Potential Cancer Hazard''and appropriately warn of all other hazards.Questions were raised as to the nature of the container that was requiredto be labeled. For example, in its initial disapproval of paragraph (m)(1)(i)through (m)(4)(ii), OMB stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">The F.S. [Formaldehyde Standard] also introduces uncertainty aboutwhether for purposes of Hazard Communication, a solid object is a ``container'',a ``mixture'', neither or both.</ITAG>Several statements in the preamble to the final rule were said to contributeto the uncertainty. Because of this apparent confusion, OSHA hereby reiteratesthat the labeling requirement of the formaldehyde standard applies to containers,and not products. All statements pertaining to the placement of hazardwarning labels in the summary and explanation of paragraph (m) of the finalrule on formaldehyde (52 FR 46282-46285), apply to containers. The containers,not the solid products, must bear the warning label. To interpret thislanguage otherwise would contradict not only the language of the standarditself, but also the stated intent of the Formaldehyde Standard (52 FR46282) to be consistent with the Hazard Communication Standard (29 CFR1910.1200).<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Technical Amendment</ITAG>OSHA is amending the language at the end of the final rule on formaldehydeas it appears in the Code of Federal Regulations to reflect the fact thatall paragraphs of the standard have been approved by OMB under ControlNumber 1218-0145.<ITAG tagnum="85">IV. Start-Up Dates and Consideration of Administrative Stay Petitionand Possible Additional Limited Rulemaking Requirements</ITAG>OSHA is providing a sixty day start-up period from the date of OMB's approval,until December 6, 1988, before it will begin enforcing the newly approvedlabeling provisions. This period is reasonable and appropriate in viewof the fact that that was the amount of time originally allotted for thepublic to become familiar with the various provisions of the formaldehydestandard before any provision became effective. During this period, affectedemployers are expected to continue to comply with the provisions of OSHA'sHazard Communication standard (29 CFR 1910.1200) which contains similarobligations.The final rule for formaldehyde, 29 CFR 1910.1048, is the subject of severalpetitions for judicial review under section 6(f) of the Occupational Safetyand Health Act (see <T3>UAW, et al. </T3>v. <T3>John A. Pendergrass, Assistant Secretary of Labor, et al., </T3>D.C.Cir., No. 87-1743). In addition, the Formaldehyde Institute and othershave petitioned the Agency for an administrative stay of the warning labelrequirement pending the outcome of judicial review of a new rulemakinglimited to the provisions of paragraph (m)(1)(i). In their petition, whichis in the Formaldehyde Docket as Exhibit 251-4 (Docket H-225C), the FormaldehydeInstitute contends that ``[t]his requirement is on the one hand, unnecessaryfor worker protection and, on the other hand, devastating to the businessof various industries which manufacture and sell products emitting minimalamounts of formaldehyde.'' OSHA initially declined to entertain the administrativestay petition because of the uncertain status of paragraph (m) due to theoriginal OMB disapproval under the Paperwork Reduction Act. Since OMB hasrecently approved the information collection requirements for hazard warninglabels, it appears to be appropriate to consider the merits of the petitionat this time.To assist OSHA in evaluating the petition, OSHA is seeking comment on thewarning label requirements of the standard, particularly the appropriatenessof the criteria set forth in paragraph (m)(1)(i). Since the publicationof the final standard on December 4, 1987, OSHA has received numerous commentson this requirement raising both substantive and procedural issues. Onesuch issue has been the question of the ability of employers to accuratelymeasure formaldehyde emissions at the 0.1 ppm level. Petitioners have alsourged OSHA to undertake additional rulemaking to reconsider the provisionsof paragraph (m)(1)(i). Comments on this issue are also requested.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Public Participation</ITAG>Interested persons are invited to submit written views and arguments asto whether the administrative stay petition (Exhibit 251-4, Docket H-225-C)should be granted and also whether the Agency should undertake additionalrulemaking to reconsider the provisions of 29 CFR 1910.1048(m)(1)(i). Thesecomments must be submitted in quadruplicate to the Docket Officer, DocketH-225-D, Room N-2634, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue,NW., Washington, DC 20210 and must be received in the Docket Office nolater than November 29, 1988.
