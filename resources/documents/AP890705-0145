Federal Home Loan Bank Board Chairman M. Danny Wall, speaking onthe eve of the board's formal release of May figures for thenation's 2,934 Sandamp;Ls, said there was only a ``slight outflow'' ofdeposits in May compared with a $5.4 billion exodus in April.   Including interest credited to accounts, deposits for the monthrose slightly for the first time since December, Wall said.   Meanwhile, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said three formerDallas Sandamp;L executives pleaded guilty to fraud and other charges ofinsider abuse. A new indictment also was handed up Wednesday.   The three executives are:   _John H. Roberts Jr., former president of Summit SavingsAssociation of Dallas. Roberts used a nominee borrower to obtain a$4.5 million loan from the institution to provide an airplane forRoberts' use. He faces a maximum jail term of 10 years and a $15,000fine.   _Joseph R. Smith, former vice president at Sunbelt SavingsAssociation in Dallas, who pleaded guilty to conspiring to defraudthe bank board and the IRS. He faces a maximum jail sentence of fiveyears and a fine up to $250,000.   _Kenneth C. Hood, former vice presdient of Western SavingsAssociation in Dallas. He was charged with attempting to defraud theIRS by creating artificial losses and by making a false statement inconnection with a $11.3 million loan from Sunbelt. He faces amaximum sentence of seven years in prison and a fine of $500,000.   Indicted Wednesday was Bob R. Franks, former president ofNorthpark Savings Association in Richardson, Texas.   Franks is accused of illegally diverting $138,000 of Northparkfunds to make an interest payment on a $2.95 million loan fromCentennial Savings Association of Greenville, Texas. If convicted,he could be sentenced to up to 15 years in prison and fined up to$500,000.   Thornburgh attributed the three convictions, as well as the newindictment, to the Dallas Bank Fraud Task Force.   The task force, a joint effort of the Justice Department, thebank board, the FBI and the Internal Revenue Service, has broughtindictments against 50 people for Sandamp;L or bank fraud and obtained 32convictions in two years. More than 100 other people have beenconvicted for bank or Sandamp;L fraud under indictments sought by the U.S.attorney's office in Dallas.   However, Thornburgh said he opposed a provision in the House Sandamp;Lbailout bill that would require the Justice Department to maintainthe task force in Dallas and establish a similar one in SouthernCalifornia, the two areas of the country with the biggest backlogsof thrift fraud cases.   ``What we prefer to do is have the flexibility to move ourresources where they are necessary,'' Thornburgh said.</TEXT></DOC>
