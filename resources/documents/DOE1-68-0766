The procedure should be useful for simulatingsolar energy systems, requiring only the 12 monthly means (anti K/subt/), as input. The procedure is based on a time series analysis of thedaily K/sub t/ values, described in the article. It incorporates thewell-known probability distribution function for K/sub t/, by using atransformed variable, rather than K/sub t/, as the fundamental randomquantity.</TEXT></DOC>
