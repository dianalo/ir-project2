Further world-wide increases are likely this year as central banks wrestle with conflicting policies of battling inflation, sustaining economic growth and maintaining a stable dollar.    In the wake of rate increases in Britain, West Germany and five other European countries, &quot;The bottom line is that interest rates are going up everywhere,&quot; said Michael Rosenberg, manager of international fixed-income research at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. &quot;But short-term rates will rise faster than long-term rates.&quot;    A senior Bank of Japan official said, however, that there is &quot;absolutely no need to consider an adjustment in Japan's monetary policy&quot; because of the European moves. The official, who requested anonymity, stressed that a nation's monetary policy doesn't have to be adjusted following every move by other countries.    Still, there's already substantial evidence in the world's major credit markets that further discount rate increases are likely. That's because rates on short-term money market instruments remain well above official, or central bank, short-term rates. Such wide spreads typically indicate pressure on central banks to tighten credit.    &quot;The markets are very nervous,&quot; said Terence W. Collins, president of Washington-based ASB Capital Management Inc., which manages more than $6 billion of bond, stock and real estate portfolios. &quot;We think there's a very strong possibility for another round of discount rate increases this year,&quot; said John Lipsky, a director of international fixed-income research at Salomon Brothers Inc.    The rate increases sent the dollar lower and contributed to a bond price slump in the U.S. yesterday.    West Germany's half-point increase in its discount rate to 3.5% yesterday was aimed at supporting the faltering mark, officials said.    The second increase in West Germany's key interest rate in less than two months came with some tough talk from Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl. &quot;We will do everything in our power . . . to do what we can to work against a further depreciation the mark,&quot; Mr. Poehl declared at a news conference.    Mr. Poehl expressed &quot;astonishment&quot; at the mark's sharp decline against other leading currencies this year, asserting that the Bundesbank will continue to intervene in foreign-exchange markets if necessary. The Bundesbank chief also said that West German monetary policies are in broad agreement with those of the U.S. Federal Reserve.    Saying that economic fundamentals don't justify a weakening mark, Mr. Poehl said a restructuring in West German rates was neccessary &quot;because of interest rate increases in other countries, not to mention the U.S.&quot; But, the Bundesbank chief added, &quot;I hope this won't lead to another rise in interest rates world-wide.&quot;    Of the U.S. Federal Reserve's recent policy of nudging up U.S. interest rates, Mr. Poehl acknowledged U.S. concerns over inflation potential suggested by a robust economy. &quot;I think that out of the view of our American colleagues it was unavoidable, even if it wasn't an easy decision to make,&quot; he said. The Fed raised its discount rate half a point to 6 1/2% Aug. 9.    Neither the Fed nor the Treasury would comment on yesterday's European interest-rate actions. But U.S. government officials made it clear that it wasn't a surprise, and that the German discount rate rise was largely following up on other rate actions that have already been taken.    Responding to a remark by Mr. Poehl that current exchange rates don't coincide with the &quot;Louvre accord,&quot; U.S. officials said they understood that to mean that they aren't in line with the most recent agreements of the Group of Seven industrialized nations. The G-7 nations have clearly indicated their displeasure with the dollar-mark exchange rates in recent weeks by intervening heavily to push down the dollar and boost the mark.    In addition to the Bundesbank action, the Bank of England set a full-point increase in its base rate to 12%, an effort to counter signs of an overheating economy.    The British increase should cure some of the country's high domestic demand and inflation problems.    But, analysts warn, the cure will take several months to start working. And in the meantime, base rates may need to go still higher to ensure that sterling doesn't suffer as a result of the higher rate trend that is gathering pace elsewhere.    &quot;The exchange rate will be very much the key indicator now,&quot; said Peter Fellner, a senior economist at James Capel andamp; Co.    Most analysts interviewed say they expect British base rates to rise at least as high as 13% before they start declining again.    The view that firm rates are here to stay was supported by Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, who in an interview shortly after the rate announcement stated that rates may have to stay at their new highs &quot;for some time.&quot;    The base lending rate was at 7 1/2% in the first week of June. The current level is the highest in nearly 2 1/2 years and follows the release of data showing a record trade deficit in July.    On the Continent, a round of rate increases that were apparently coordinated with the Bundesbank had Switzerland lifting its discount rate half a point to 3% and its Lombard rate half a point to 5%. Italy raised its discount rate half a point to 12 1/2%, and Austria's central bank announced a half-point increase in its discount rate to 4%.    The Bank of France tightened credit for the first time since November 1987 with increases of 1/4-point each in its money market intervention rate and the rate on its securities repurchase facility to 7% and 7 3/4%, respectively.    Previously, the French Finance Ministry had hoped to bring down interest rates to stimulate economic growth. But the ministry's top priorities are to avoid inflation and to defend the franc.    The Netherlands also announced minor increases in two of its market rates. Canada's major commercial banks joined in by raising their prime lending rate to 11.25% from 10.75%, effective today.    Just about all of the leading industrial nations are showing tendencies to tighten credit amid concern that buoyant domestic economies could lead to higher inflation. &quot;The central banks have to face the fact that we have a very robust world economy,&quot; said Mr. Rosenberg of Merrill Lynch.    For instance, &quot;U.S. exports are up 27% on a year-over-year basis, while West German exports are up 19%,&quot; he noted. &quot;If U.S. and West German exports are up so much, somebody's obviously buying these goods -- prompting the bond market vigilantes, or central banks, to raise interest rates to keep economies from overheating.&quot;    Since the start of the year, rates have surged on three-month mark deposits to 5 3/8% from 3 3/4%; on sterling deposits to 12% from 7 1/2%; and on U.S. short-term rates to 8 3/4% from 6 1/2%. Short-term Japanese rates have climbed to 4 7/8% from 4 1/2%.    While British and U.S. rates generally have climbed in response to robust domestic growth, there were many catalysts for the West German rate increase. The biggest was the weakening mark.    Among international investors, West Germany's interest rates are considered too low relative to rates elsewhere, according to analysts. In addition, the likely imposition of a 10% withholding tax in the West German bond market has sparked record capital flight from the country. More than $50 billion flowed out of Germany in the first sixth months. Most of this is from German residents looking for higher yields, said Mr. Rosenberg.    The Bundesbank, meanwhile, has contended with growing fear of inflation reflected in the torrid, above-target growth of the nation's money supply and a ballooning budget deficit. Since the start of the year, budget deficit has climbed from an estimated 29 billion marks to a projected 40 billion ($21.3 billion) for 1988.    And further credit tightening by the Federal Reserve in the U.S. will put pressure on the Bundesbank to push German rates higher, Mr. Lipsky of Salomon predicted. &quot;Thus, there are some real problems ahead,&quot; he said. Nevertheless, Mr. Lipsky said, yesterday's increases mean &quot;we may be closer to the end of the process of rising rates.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
