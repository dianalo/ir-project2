While inaqueous chloride solution pitting was transgranular and randomly oriented,in methanol-chloride solution pits were observed to initiate and propagatealong the grain boundaries. In aqueous chloride solution very irregularand sponge like zirconium metal was formed inside the pit while in methanol-chloridesolution the pits were crystallographic in nature. Optical microscopyhas revealed that pits preferentially initiate and propagate along scratchline in aqueous chloride solution, but such was not the case in nonaqueousmethanol-chloride solution. The nature and the mechanism operating inthe catastropic failure of these materials are investigated. (author).10 refs., 11 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
