The Liberals lost twice to Prime Minister Brian Mulroney'sProgressive Conservative Party since Turner took over theleadership in 1984. The most recent defeat was in November 1988.   ``It is my intention to resign as leader of the Liberal Party ofCanada at an appropriate time, after the national executive haschosen a date for a leadership convention,'' Turner said in aletter released at an Ottawa news conference.   ``I do feel regret that I was not able to accomplish theultimate goal of a politician: To win an election and become primeminister,'' Turner said.   Turner, 59, inherited the prime minister's job in 1984 afterPierre Trudeau resigned, but Turner's term lasted only 79 days. Heand the Liberals were ousted by Brian Mulroney and theConservatives in an election that left barely 40 Liberals in theCommons.   Much of his era as Liberal leader was marked by fierce internalbattles within the party, which dominated Canadian politics formuch of the 20th century.   Turner, a lawyer, revived his own and his party's saggingfortunes with a persistent, emotional campaign against the freetrade agreement that Mulroney signed with former President Reaganin January 1988.   The agreement will eliminate trade barriers between the UnitedStates and Canada over a 10-year period.   ``This is the fight of my life. I've never been more seriousabout any cause in my life,'' he said of his effort to halt theagreement during the fall election campaign.   The high point of the campaign came during a televised debatewith Mulroney and Ed Broadbent of the third-place New DemocraticParty, in which Turner accused the prime minister of placingCanada's sovereignty at risk by signing the agreement.   ``You sold us out,'' Turner said, almost instantly soaring inthe opinion polls and attracting fervent crowds to his once nearlydeserted rallies.   But Mulroney went on to win a second consecutive majoritygovernment, clinching the way for the pact to take effect Jan. 1.   Turner gained credit for doubling the party's seats to 83 in the295-seat House of Commons.   The New Democrats also are in a leadership race after Broadbentannounced in March his retirement after 14 years at the socialistparty's helm.   Mulroney, speaking to reporters in Boston during a three-dayvisit to the United States, called Turner ``a very worthyopponent'' who ``gave as good as he got.''   Turner said he expected to remain a member of Parliament for``the immediate future.'' He said he had no job lined up in theprivate sector.   A Liberal Party convention is set for October in Calgary, butthe party executive can decide to defer a leadership convention andturn the gathering into a policy conference.</TEXT></DOC>
