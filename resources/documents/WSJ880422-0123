And for years, his political enemies have called for his scalp. But how will he fare against the wrath of the islands' bankers?    In one of the more curious uprisings in recent Caribbean affairs, many of the usually discreet bankers in this balmy offshore financial center are furious with Mr. Pindling, who handily won re-election last year for a fifth term despite allegations that linked him and his top political allies to drug lords. In the past few months, Mr. Pindling doubled fees banks must pay to operate in the Bahamas. He publicly accused bankers of being greedy and uninterested in the welfare of the Bahamas. And many bankers say Mr. Pindling, who is black, has suggested the white-dominated banking establishment is racist.    &quot;Relations between bankers and the government have never been worse,&quot; says one foreign banker here.    That mightn't seem earthshaking, but in the Bahamas, banking ranks with tourism and drug smuggling as a pillar of what until recently was the Caribbean's most robust economy. Bank-secrecy laws and generous tax policies made the islands one of the mainstays of the hot-money circuit; the Bahamas have 385 financial institutions, a bank per-capita ratio of about 1:600. They provide thousands of jobs.    Moreover, the Bahamian economy is wobbling toward a recession, its first serious dive since Mr. Pindling led the nation to independence from Britain in 1971. There's even a minor banking crisis, the first in memory, caused by a liquidity squeeze. &quot;This is a time when the banking and public sectors should pull together,&quot; says Hubert Ingraham, an opposition member of parliament. &quot;Instead, we get all this hot air.&quot;    The fuss partly reflects the fact bankers have had things their way for so long. Many bankers were outraged when Mr. Pindling, who is also minister of finance, doubled the cost of annual licenses for the largest banks to $100,000. They can easily afford it, but bankers didn't learn of it until someone spotted it buried in the voluminous government budget issued last fall. The central bank apparently wasn't aware of the move; in January it billed the banks at the old rates only to come back for more money weeks later.    &quot;My God, you'd think he would at least consult us,&quot; one banker says. &quot;Many people were affronted.&quot;    A few weeks ago, Mr. Pindling spoke to 200 bankers at a posh Nassau hotel. He ripped into banks for failing to promote Bahamians to top management and not contributing enough to local development. The four largest banks, Royal Bank of Canada, Barclays PLC, Bank of Nova Scotia and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, were targeted.    &quot;What, apart from making money, has any of them done for the Bahamas or given back to the Bahamas in the last 20 years . . . ?&quot; Mr. Pindling said. His reference to &quot;changing the complexion of banking&quot; was read by many as a thinly veiled charge of racism in the upper echelons of banking, which remains largely a preserve of white foreigners.    &quot;The bankers felt publicly humiliated,&quot; says one diplomat. A Pindling proposal that banks finance a theater to commemorate the 500th anniversary of Columbus's arrival on the islands fizzled. &quot;There isn't much enthusiasm for helping him out at the moment,&quot; the diplomat says.    Mr. Pindling couldn't be reached for comment, but some bankers trace his bank-bashing to anger over a loan Royal Bank reportedly made to Mr. Pindling's political opponents during the bitter election campaign last summer. Royal Bank wouldn't comment, but banking sources say Mr. Pindling was particularly galled by the loan, because Royal Bank for decades has been the government's main bank. &quot;It was a dumb move by Royal,&quot; one financial executive said. &quot;We're all paying for it.&quot;    All this might be dismissed as quirky Caribbean politics if the Bahamian banking system weren't experiencing a liquidity crunch. The origin of the banking crisis isn't clear, but some Bahamians blame a consumer-lending frenzy by foreign banks in the Bahamas last year, in which they tried to utilize the more than $100 million in reserves they built up in 1987, a banner year for tourism and drugs. But the banks were badly overextended and the flow of money has slowed this year as tourism and drug trafficking, the latter under U.S. and Bahamian pressure, has dropped off.    The result: Almost all the big banks have routinely failed to meet reserve requirements, and credit dried up because the central bank forced the banks to build up liquidity. Businesses fear the credit shutdown could lead to a real-estate disaster, as dozens of half-built shopping malls and hotels won't be completed without more financing. Economists predict gross national product, which grew at an average 7% for the past several years, may decline 3% or worse.    &quot;There's no money,&quot; says Ruby Sweeting, an official at the Bahamas Chamber of Commerce. &quot;We aren't used to this. There's tremendous concern.&quot;    But others play down the difficulties. &quot;Tourism has been here from time immemorial, and it will bounce back,&quot; says Frank Davis, a former central bank official who heads Massraf Faysal Al-Islami Bahamas Ltd., a bank with close ties to the Saudi royal family. &quot;Those bankers who are unhappy will be happy again. There has never been a sea without a ripple.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
