David Herrlinger, the securities analyst whose bogus offer for Dayton Hudson Corp. shook Wall Street Tuesday, a lawyer for Mr. Herrlinger said.    E.F. Hutton Group Inc., which employs Mr. Herrlinger's brother, Thomas, as a stockbroker in Albuquerque, N.M., said it also had discussions with the SEC.    Richard Miller, who employed David Herrlinger at a Cincinnati investment firm until dismissing him Tuesday, said he told the SEC that his associate had a brokerage account with his brother. He said Thomas called David Monday afternoon and Tuesday morning. However, he said he had no indication that David told Thomas that he was going to make an offer for Dayton Hudson. And he added that it wasn't unusual for the brothers to speak with each other frequently.    Steven Nelson, a spokesman for E.F. Hutton, said the firm has discussed the events of the past week with the SEC. Asked whether Thomas Herrlinger had any advance knowledge of his brother's announcement, Mr. Nelson replied, &quot;Absolutely not.&quot;    Mr. Nelson said Thomas Herrlinger didn't own any Dayton Hudson shares and hadn't been trading in them for his own account in recent days. He declined to comment on the stock ownership of Thomas Herrlinger's clients, noting that the firm considers such information confidential.    Thomas Herrlinger, who joined the family here in meeting with the SEC, couldn't be reached for comment.    It is understood that the SEC was inquiring into the stability of David Herrlinger, who was admitted to Good Samaritan Hospital here Tuesday hours after it became apparent that his bid wasn't bona fide. At the time, a family spokesman said Mr. Herrlinger was &quot;not himself.&quot;    Yesterday afternoon, a hospital spokeswoman said Mr. Herrlinger remained in fair condition. The hospital has declined to say what Mr. Herrlinger is being treated for.    An SEC spokesman declined to comment on the investigation.    On Tuesday, Mr. Herrlinger, 46 years old, announced through the Dow Jones News Service that he and a family investment concern were offering $70 a share for Dayton Hudson, a Minneapolis-based retailer. </TEXT></DOC>
