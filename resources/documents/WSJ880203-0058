Mr. Reagan, in a speech that the commercial television networks refused to broadcast, argued strongly for his already pared-down package. But he said that he won't ship the $3.6 million portion consisting of weapons and ammunition if Congress concludes that Nicaragua's Sandinista regime is complying with the Central America peace plan, which the region's governments signed last August.    Under Mr. Reagan's aid plan, the administration would start shipping &quot;nonlethal&quot; aid March 1, when previously approved shipments will run out. The administration previously offered to withhold deliveries of the so-called lethal aid in the latest package until March 31, and last night, Mr. Reagan proposed giving Congress 10 days after that to stop the weapons shipments, by finding that the Sandinistas are complying with the regional peace plan.    But Democratic critics were quick to point out that since the Senate has never rejected Contra aid, it is unlikely that both chambers would move to stop the White House from delivering military supplies to the rebels.    Democratic Rep. Tony Coelho of California, the House majority whip, predicted that the president's latest offer won't win enough votes to assure House approval of the Contra aid package when it comes up for a vote today. &quot;It won't change a single vote, so I'm still optimistic we will win,&quot; he said.    Delivering the Democrats' official response, Indiana Rep. Lee Hamilton said Mr. Reagan's request &quot;will cripple, if not destroy, the peace process. It will lead toward more war, more oppression, less democracy and more Soviet aid.&quot; Mr. Hamilton called for sending the Contras &quot;food, clothing and medicine&quot; instead of &quot;planes and helicopters . . . guns and bullets.&quot;    But in his speech, which was broadcast by Cable News Network, Mr. Reagan said that &quot;there's nothing humanitarian about asking people to go up against Soviet helicopter gunships with nothing more than boots and bandages.&quot; Using a map of the region with Nicaragua painted bright red, the president warned that abandonment of the Contras would lead to the spread of communism and give Moscow a &quot;beachhead for aggression against the United States.&quot;    He also rejected his opponents' contention that supplying the Contras would damage the peace plan. U.S. assistance to the Contras, he insisted, had been the major factor in &quot;bringing the communist Sandinistas to the negotiating table and forcing them to negotiate seriously.&quot;    House Democratic leaders are trying to woo so-called swing voters with the promise that, within a few weeks, they will offer a $10 million to $15 million package of aid for the Contras, limited to food, clothing and medicine. Such a plan is designed to allay the fears of legislators who worry that completely cutting off the rebel forces now could become an election-year issue.    &quot;People want to be able to vote for something,&quot; said Rep. Thomas Carper (D., Del.), one of about 20 lawmakers who are likely to be decisive in today's vote. &quot;There are a number of us who want a constructive alternative.&quot; Both sides expect the vote to be extremely close.    The Democrats haven't yet decided the crucial issue of who would deliver the aid under their alternative plan. The Central Intelligence Agency, which has been making previously approved deliveries, is capable of air-dropping supplies to the rebels in their camps. But international agencies, such as the International Red Cross, would have to use public facilities.    Using international agencies wouldn't be acceptable to the Contras, though, because it would force them to leave their camps to pick up the goods. One option being considered by the Democrats would permit the CIA to continue deliveries, subject to inspections by international groups.    President Reagan was lobbying for the Contra aid hours before yesterday's speech, with at least 20 members of Congress invited to the White House. Rep. Roy Dyson (D., Md.) said he offered to vote for the aid if President Reagan would relocate two squadrons of aircraft to an air base in his district. The White House hadn't decided last night whether to honor the request.    ---   Ellen Hume contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
