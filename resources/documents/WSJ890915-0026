Sandamp;P said the upgrade reflects &quot;substantial&quot; progress in economic base development and the likelihood for continued progress in the residential, commercial and service sectors. The ratings firm said financial operations continue to be &quot;satisfactory&quot; and general fund financial operations have benefited from higher payments from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey properties in Newark. Sandamp;P also assigned a rating of Single-A to $33.6 million of new general improvement and water bonds to be offered Wednesday.    ---   HAYWARD,CALIF. -- Bio-Response Inc.'s convertible subordinated debentures, due 2001, were downgraded by Moody's Investors Service Inc. to Ca from Caa. About $22 million is affected. The rating service said the downgrade reflects the company's Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law filing earlier this week. The company, which specializes in culturing mammalian cells and producing cellular proteins, declined to comment on the downgrade. </TEXT></DOC>
