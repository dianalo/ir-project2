That final rule was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on June 16, 1988 (53 FR 22612), and was subsequentlyincorrectly published in the 1988 edition of the Code of Federal Regulations(CFR). Both the <T4>Federal Register</T4> and the CFR contain the error. Both documentscontain the word ``should'' in andSection; 1926.704(b) instead of the word``shall.'' This rule corrects the error by changing the word ``should''to ``shall.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>October 5, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Mr. James Foster, U.S. Departmentof Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Office of Informationand Consumer Affairs, Room N3647, 200 Construction Avenue NW., Washington,DC 20210, telephone (202) 523-8148.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>On September 16, 1985, OSHA publisheda notice of proposed rulemaking in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (50 FR 37543) proposing to amend its requirementsin subpart Q addressing the hazards associated with concrete and masonryconstuction. That notice contained a requirement in andSection; 1926.706(a)(4)(i)which required, ``* * * lifting inserts for tilt-up precast concrete membersshall be capable of supporting at least two times the maximum intendedload applied or transmitted to them.''On June 16, 1988, when the final rule for Concrete and Masonry Constructionwas issued in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (53 FR 22612), OSHA discussed the above-mentionedprovision in the Summary and Explanation Section (53 FR 22637). In itsexplanation, OSHA noted that the provision in andSection; 1926.706(a)(4)(i)was being relocated to andSection; 1926.704(b) and that the provision inthe final rule was unchanged from the proposed rule. In response to theone comment received on the provision, OSHA clarified the provision byadding the words ``which are embedded or otherwise attached to'' afterthe words ``lifting inserts;'' otherwise the provision was the same asproposed. Further, in paraphrasing the regulation, OSHA also stated inits discussion of andSection; 1926.704(b) that ``Paragraph (b) specifiesthat lifting inserts which * * * to tilt-up wall panels must be capableof supporting twice the maximum intended load applied or transmitted tothem.'' This language further indicates OSHA's intent that the requirementbe viewed as mandatory. OSHA does not promulgate regulations using theterm ``should.'' Use of that term would render the provision unenforceable.OSHA notes that the error occurred during the printing process. The documentsubmitted by OSHA for publication contained the word ``shall,'' howeverthe word ``should'' was printed in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on June 16, 1988, and in the CFR issued for July1988.<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Participation</ITAG>In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B), OSHA is waiving the opportunityfor public comment because it finds good cause that comment is not necessary.This rule merely corrects an error that occurred in the printing of the<T4>Federal Register</T4> issued on June 16, 1988, and subsequently repeatedin the Code of Federal Regulations.Additionally, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3), OSHA finds good cause formaking the effective date of this rule the same date as its date of publication.<ITAG tagnum="21">Signed at Washington, DC, this 29 day of September 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Alan C.
