In a move that could sharply change the nature ofmanagement accountability to holders, the Securities andExchange Commission will make it more difficult for companiesto keep certain questions off proxy ballots. That meansshareholders are likely to get a chance to vote on severalissues dealing with how top executives are paid.</LP><TEXT>   Until now, compensation has been mostly off limits toshareholders, who were told by companies and the SEC that paywas a matter of &quot;ordinary business&quot; for a corporation andtherefore wasn't fodder for proxy votes. But in recent years,the agency has been inching toward allowing more votes. Forexample, last year, the SEC decided to force companies toallow shareholder votes on &quot;golden parachute&quot; executive paypackages.   At the same time, companies have become more responsive toshareholder demands. In the past two proxy seasons, 29companies have agreed to allow holders to decide questionsinvolving management compensation.   At a congressional hearing yesterday, the SEC's directorof corporation finance, Linda Quinn, signaled a further shiftin the agency's policy. If shareholders put together apay-related proposal to change a company's bylaws that is inkeeping with state corporation law, &quot;it will be viewed notjust as a compensation issue and not just as ordinarybusiness,&quot; she said. That means the agency is likely to blockcompanies from keeping the question off the ballot.   Ms. Quinn said it wasn't clear whether the proposal wouldhave to deal with the executive pay system as a whole orwhether a plan could set specific policies such as a dollarlimit on the chief executive's salary. That would depend, shesaid, on how far state law would allow holders to changecompany bylaws, which are like a constitution. For now,though, most issues are expected to deal withcorporate-governance questions, such as whether to have theexecutive compensation committee composed of outsidedirectors only.   Significantly, Delaware is one of the states that will beinvolved in the new rules because it allows corporate bylawchanges by holders. Delaware is the corporate home of morethan half of all U.S. corporations.   The shift comes at a time when the SEC is studying thebroader issue of proxy reform. Shareholder groups, led byinstitutional investors, are pressing the agency to open theproxy process to a broader range of questions, allow proxyvoting to be confidential and permit freer communicationamong shareholders. Ms. Quinn said the agency staff will beproposing proxy-rule changes to the commission in the nextmonth or two.   Corporate America has been fighting those steps, offeringits own advice to the agency. It contends that shareholdersshouldn't be allowed to dabble in the day-to-day operationsof companies and that institutional holders are simply tryingto set up a network to empower themselves against management.   Ms. Quinn's comments cheered shareholder groups. &quot;It isunquestionably clear that compensation is the corporategovernance issue of the '90s,&quot; said Nell Minow, president ofInstitutional Shareholder Services. &quot;It all boils down tocompensation.&quot; Ms. Minow added that she expects to see anumber of shareholder proposals in line with the new rules.   Corporate groups expressed caution. A spokesman for theBusiness Roundtable Task Force on Corporate Governance,Austin Sullivan of General Mills Inc., noted that thebig-business group agreed with Ms. Quinn's view that holderresolutions dealing with bylaws must fall within theguidelines of state law. But he added that &quot;it's difficult toknow if Ms. Quinn's remarks represent a significant departurefrom the existing rules until we see what sort of proposalthey end up approving.&quot;   By almost any measure, top executives are paid handsomely.In a survey of 200 chief executives, Prof. Graef Crystal ofthe University of California at Berkeley found that theiraverage annual compensation including salary, options andbonuses was $2.8 million.   He told the Senate Subcommittee on Oversight andGovernment Management that the chief executive officer of amajor Japanese company earns about 17 times the pay of theaverage Japanese worker. The figure rises to about 23 to 25times in France and Germany. But the average U.S. chief makes53 more times than the average worker in cash compensationand 109 times more if bonuses and stock options are added.   Sen. Carl Levin (D., Mich.), who heads the subcommittee,said he plans to press the SEC to move toward allowing morevotes on compensation, particularly those dealing with stockoptions.</TEXT></DOC>
