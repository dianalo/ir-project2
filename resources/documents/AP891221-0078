Rear Adm. Ted Scheafer told reporters ``organized resistance hadpretty much been taken care of.'' He acknowledged sporadicfighting, saying ``people on the tops of buildings are the kind ofthing I'm talking about.''   Defense Department spokesman Pete Williams said there had been``some sightings'' reported of Noriega, but he remained at largedespite a massive military operation involving more than 20,000U.S. forces.   Officials said they believed the dictator remained in Panama,despite reports that placed him in three different countries _Colombia, Mexico and the Dominican Republic.   Army Lt. Gen. Tom Kelly said there was a possibility Noriega andsome loyal troops had sought refuge in the jungles, and said ``whenit comes time we'll do what's necessary'' to find him.   Williams said the latest U.S. casualty count stood at 19 killedin action, 117 wounded and one missing. He said the first Americandead were being flown back to Dover Air Force Base in Delawarelater in the day.   Officials at military hospitals in San Antonio, Texas, said theywere treating about 190 wounded troops evacuated from Panama, ahigher count than that reported at the Pentagon.   Williams said American troops had taken roughly 1,500 prisonersin the first 36 hours of armed combat.   Williams said there were three reports of Americans being heldagainst their will, and added, ``We take them all seriously.'' Hesaid they included a group of Smithsonian Institution scientistsand John Myerson, a CBS News television producer.   Officials said American troops evacuated 29 Americans and 35foreign nationals, mostly Panamanians, from the Marriott Hotel inPanama City late Wednesday night.   Williams said U.S. troops had discovered a large cache ofdocuments in a military headquarters building, and they would bestudied for possible use in any trial against Noriega, who is underindictment in the United States on drug charges.   The spokesman put the casualty count for Panamanian DefenseForces as 59 killed, 66 wounded and more than 1,500 taken prisoner.   Kelly, director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff,outlined three goals for the day's military operation: continuedsupport for the operations of the new government, to secure PanamaCity and to ``continue to track Mr. Noriega in an effort to capturehim.''   He said U.S. forces had secured the legislative building, and heraised the possibility that Guillermo Endara, the new U.S.-backedpresident, would go there during the day.   The formal briefing came several hours after Defense SecretaryDick Cheney called the deaths of American servicemen ``a terribletragedy,'' but said the number of casualties was low given thecomplexity of the operation.   As for Noriega, who now as a $1 million U.S. bounty on his head,Cheney said, ``We're getting phone calls coming in from Panamanianswho have suspicions, thoughts or ideas'' about where Noriega may behiding.   ``We will chase down the individual reports, but we do not knowwhere he is,'' said Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefsof Staff.   In television interviews, Powell and Cheney said it was unclearhow many Americans were being detained or held hostage in Panama.   ``You can be sure, however, that this is a primary concern forus today,'' Powell said on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America.'' ``Wewill do everything we can to determine who is unaccounted for anddo everything we can to locate those individuals.''   Reinforcements were sent in late Wednesday from Fort Ord,Calif., and Fort Bragg, N.C., to bolster the U.S. troopsparticipating in ``Operation Just Cause'' to about 24,000 men.   Cheney said he hoped some of the troops would be called home byChristmas, but Powell and other Pentagon officials said it wasunclear when the United States would be withdraw all of the troopssent in to bolster those already stationed at the Panama Canal.   The U.S. attack force planned to make sure Panama City's streetswere clear of Noriega loyalists today, Kelly said, adding that mostPanamanian units had dispersed and may have fled into the jungle.   ``There is every chance that we will go off after them,'' headded.   Kelly and Sheafer, also on the staff of the Joint Chiefs, saidWednesday there were difficult tasks ahead, even though thePanamanian Defense Forces were largely subdued.   ``We went after them first. We have reduced them,'' Kelly said.``That's a problem we're having in a lot of areas in that much ofthe PDF is fleeing in the face of the U.S. military units.''   The Americans' next priority was to ferret out 18 so-calledDignity Battalions, armed gangs primarily roaming the streets ofPanama City, a metropolis of about 1 million people, officials said.   The battalions ``vary in size from as few as a couple of dozenpeople to about 250,'' said Sheafer. ``They are throughout manyparts of Panama City at this time.''   The move into the city is designed in part to protect Americansand others, Kelly said.   ``Urban operations are possibly the most difficult kind,'' hesaid. ``To sweep through, it's going to take a lot of people.''   Kelly said the Americans, some of whom had been up for threedays traveling and fighting, were exhausted.   About 7,000 troops, including Army Rangers, Marines,paratroopers from the 82nd Airborne Division, special units andmilitary police, were flown into Panama Tuesday evening for the 1a.m. pre-dawn start-up on Wednesday.   They joined about 13,000 U.S. troops stationed in Panama withthe primary mission of protecting the Panama Canal. The canal wasopen Wednesday with no threat from the Panamanians, Kelly said.   U.S. troops relied on heavy equipment in their efforts to routthe PDF. Four light tanks, called Sheridans, were brought to Panamaearlier, Kelly said. The military also used six Apache helicoptersand some Air Force AC-130 gunships.</TEXT></DOC>
