Thehandsome, easily manipulated Dr. Cain was certain no good would come of suchafter-hours tinkering, but West, a boyishly enthusiastic nut case, was inseventh heaven.;    Here, finally, was a morgue full of bodies to test hisiridescent green serum, the goop that had already re-animated one corpse, onepartially dissected black cat and one severed head, the latter borrowed fromMiskatonic Hospital's Chief of Surgery, Dr. Carl Hill.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Weekend  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  THE RE-ANIMATOR MAKES A 'BRIDE'  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Film Review  </MEMO><TEXT>     The morbid doings of West and Cain are well-known to the midnight-cultgang. &quot;Re-Animator&quot; stands with &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; and Sam Raimi's&quot;Evil Dead II&quot; as one of the great horror spoofs. It's so funny and scary, wehad every reason to expect its sequel, &quot;Bride of Re-Animator&quot; (at the TowneTheater tonight and Saturday), would be a disappointment -- all gore, littleenergy or wit.;    Boy, were we ever wrong.;    &quot;Bride of Re-Animator&quot; is tothe original what &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot; is to the 1931 Boris Karloffclassic. To wit: It's wilder, funnier and, in terms of effects, quite a bitmore adventurous. It's so good, the auteurists out there will want to rethinkStuart Gordon's place in the horror pantheon.;    Gordon is listed as directorof the original, but in the five years since he's directed such sub-parentries as &quot;From Beyond&quot; and &quot;Robot Jox.&quot; &quot;Bride&quot; director Brian Yuznaproduced the original. Could he have been the real brains behind&quot;Re-Animator,&quot; the ultimate mad-doctor lampoon? Something to contemplate asyou're watching the most madcap monster jamboree since Roger (&quot;Little Shop ofHorrors&quot;) Corman's heyday.;    &quot;Bride&quot; picks up eight months after themassacre at Miskatonic Hospital. West and Cain (Jeffrey Combs and Bruce Abbottagain) are doing penance by working out of a field hospital in Peru during acivil war. West, still up to his old tricks, has been experimenting on theready supply of war wounded. The &quot;key&quot; to his admittedly unstable serum: theamniotic fluid of an indigenous iguana.;    Armed with this information, Westand Cain return to Arkham, where they again share lodging and rounds (if notbedside manner) at the hospital. Their new digs? The converted caretaker'scottage at a local cemetery. West, of course, couldn't be happier; Cain againcomplains of his friend's &quot;morbid doodling.&quot; But when the opportunity tojump-start his late girlfriend Meg's heart presents itself, he lends a willinghand.;    &quot;Bride&quot; reunites much of the acting and technical talent of theoriginal. Richard Band again contributed the mood-setting score (a brazenrip-off of Hitchcock's &quot;Psycho&quot; theme), and Tony Boublin again supervised theeffects, which run from a five-fingered spider with attached eyeball to ahellishly re-animated pooch and giant bat. The makeup-effects boys deliver apatchwork bride that's loads ghastlier than Elsa Lanchester's 1935 model but,in its way, just as anguished and touching.;    &quot;Bride,&quot; like its predecessor,redefines the word &quot;rude&quot; as it heaps on the bad puns (Dr. Hill, the originaltalking head, is taunted as &quot;a no-body&quot;) and outrageous sight-gags. Where elsecan you find a pooch with a real handshake? It's part of the incorrigibleWest's, ahem, basement handiwork.;    All this, and the last word on femaleangst as the synthetic woman wigs out over a suddenly off-ish Cain. &quot;What doyou want?&quot; she howls while approaching him with heart in hand. Literally.;    Bride of Re-Animator; (star)(star)(star); Rated: R (violence, nudity); Cast:Bruce Abbott, Jeffrey Combs  </TEXT><BYLINE>  GLENN LOVELL, Mercury News Film Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910308  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  7E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  618  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday March 8, 199100068281,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
