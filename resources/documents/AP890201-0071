The guerrillas had attacked a remote village in thesouthern Philippines.   Field reports radioed to army's headquarters in Manila said atleast 11 other people _ eight civilians, two militiamen and asoldier _ were killed in Tuesday's fighting.

The area has a mixed Moslem and Christian population and isroamed not only by rebels but also by bands of outlaws.   Col. Antonio Nale, a brigade commander who led the governmenttroops, said the daylong battle began after about 300 rebelsattacked the village of Kulasian in Zamboanga del Sur, 510 milessoutheast of the capital, burning three houses.
