The reduction is about 50% greater than ATandamp;T proposed last month. The agency also ordered ATandamp;T to reduce its WATS rates 5%, or roughly twice the cut the company had proposed. Both cuts take effect tomorrow.    The 11% cut represents a boon to telephone customers, but bad news to other long-distance companies, analysts said. Companies such as MCI Communications Corp. and US Sprint Communications Co. face worsening prospects because of growing price competition in the telephone industry and the steady erosion of their cost advantages over ATandamp;T.    &quot;The price cuts will put a squeeze on ATandamp;T's competition,&quot; said Harry Shooshan, a Washington telecommunications consultant.    The FCC doesn't regulate the rates ATandamp;T's competitors charge, but these companies regularly try to match ATandamp;T's price reductions for fear of losing customers. Albert Halprin, chief of the FCC's common carrier bureau, estimated that such companies as MCI and US Sprint would reduce their rates by several hundred million dollars to compete with ATandamp;T.    Page Montgomery, vice president of Economics andamp; Technology Inc., a Boston consulting company, called the agency's action &quot;a watershed event&quot; because of the effect on competition. He said that ATandamp;T is offering especially large breaks to business customers -- the target market for MCI and Sprint.    In addition, he said ATandamp;T would substantially drop its rates for the first minute of a long-distance call. That's the time period that ATandamp;T's competitors usually refer to when they claim they have cheaper rates than ATandamp;T. Now, said Mr. Montgomery, ATandamp;T may use the same tactic against competitors. &quot;Don't be surprised to see Cliff Robertson (ATandamp;T's television spokesman) pointing to a price chart in the middle of the Super Bowl,&quot; said Mr. Montgomery.    So-called resellers of long-distance services face an even grimmer future, Mr. Montgomery added. A little-noticed FCC ruling, which also goes into effect tomorrow, eliminates a steep discount that let those companies underprice ATandamp;T. Resellers lease WATS lines from ATandamp;T and other long-distance companies and resell use of the lines to consumers.    Nevertheless, FCC Chairman Mark Fowler said that competition would flourish because costs for all long-distance carriers have dropped. &quot;We have every reason to believe that competition is alive, well and very feisty,&quot; he said.    ATandamp;T's price cuts are largely the result of decreases in the charges ATandamp;T pays local phone companies for connections to customers homes and businesses. In October, the local telephone companies proposed reducing these rates by about $1.1 billion. In November, ATandamp;T proposed a $1.2 billion reduction in its rates, but the FCC yesterday said that wasn't sufficient.    The agency said that ATandamp;T had overestimated certain of its costs by $225 million and hadn't properly calculated the effect of the reduced connection charges. In addition, the FCC earlier this year lowered ATandamp;T's long-distance profit margin to 12.2% from 12.75%.    ATandamp;T said that it planned to file its new rates today and that the additional rate reduction will be applied across all its switched services. According to its preliminary estimates, ATandamp;T said its night and weekend rates will be reduced 5.9% instead of 2.7%, as proposed in November. Evening rates -- those charged between 5 p.m. and 11 p.m. -- will be reduced 9.3% instead of 6.2%, and day rates will be reduced 14.5% instead of 11.6%, as previously proposed.    Robert Morris III, analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., said he expected ATandamp;T to again target its rate reductions to those classes of service where the giant carrier has the greatest competition. While about $225 million of the additional $625 million reduction is for disallowed expenses, Mr. Morris said the effect on ATandamp;T's earnings next year of this latest reduction may not be great because the company probably overestimated expenses anyway.    Mr. Morris said earnings of ATandamp;T's competitors may be hurt more than ATandamp;T by ATandamp;T's rate cut. Competitors will have to cut rates to respond and won't get expenses lowered as much.    In addition, Mr. Morris said the FCC's demand for bigger rate cuts suggests that even under price regulation, ATandamp;T may not be able to increase earnings from its long-distance operations much. ATandamp;T has been lobbying for a change from current rate-of-return regulation, which in 1987 allows the company to earn as much as 12.7% before being required to refund money on its interstate long-distance rate base of $9.5 billion. Price regulation has been suggested as an alternative method of regulating the company.    US Sprint said it probably will lower its rates, but couldn't say whether it will maintain what it says is its average 9.2% discount to ATandamp;T rates.    A spokesman for MCI complained bitterly about the timing of the FCC announcement. &quot;The size of this price cut isn't as troubling as the way it came about and the lack of recognition by the FCC of what a competitive marketplace really is,&quot; the spokesman said. &quot;This was orchestrated by ATandamp;T and the FCC, to announce rate cuts to which competitors can't physically respond&quot; because the agency will be closed for the New Year's holiday.    Washington-based MCI plans to reduce its rates in response &quot;as quickly as we can,&quot; the spokesman said. Some company officials have suggested that MCI might cut its prices less than ATandamp;T, allowing its price advantage to shrink from its current level of about 10%, but the spokesman declined to comment. He said only that MCI &quot;is going to remain lower than ATandamp;T on every call.&quot;    Mr. Morris of Prudential-Bache said MCI might cut its prices about 9.5%. A rate reduction of that magnitude, he said, could be financed by a combination of lower access charges for connecting with the networks of local telephone companies and cost-cutting actions MCI announced earlier this month.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, ATandamp;T stock closed at $25 a share, down 25 cents. In over-the-counter trading on the national market, MCI stock closed at $6.375 a share, down 12.5 cents.    The FCC estimates that including the latest price cuts, interstate long-distance rates will have dropped one-third since the Jan. 1, 1984, breakup of ATandamp;T. Local telephone rates have jumped in many states, however. The FCC's Mr. Halprin said the commission believed that local rates would level off in 1987 or even drop somewhat.    Separately, Chairman Fowler, who has been rumored to be planning to leave the agency soon, was equivocal about his intentions. &quot;As things stand, I intend to serve,&quot; he said at the news conference called to discuss the ATandamp;T price cut. But he wouldn't commit himself to remaining at the agency through 1987.    FCC Commissioner Dennis Patrick is widely considered to be the front-runner to succeed Mr. Fowler.    ---   Also contributing to this article were Janet Guyon in New York and Francine Schwadel in Philadelphia. </TEXT></DOC>
