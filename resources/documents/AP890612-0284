(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Up to 10,000 coal miners walked off the jobMonday in southern West Virginia and threatened to take the wildcatstrike nationwide.   The walkout followed a rally Sunday at which United Mine WorkersPresident Richard Trumka told miners to ``rise up and fight back''in support of 1,600 miners on strike in West Virginia and Virginiaagainst Pittston Coal Group Inc.   In the Pittston strike, a judge in Virginia has jailed threeunion leaders and fined the union more than $3 million for violatinga ban on mass picketing.   ``They're protesting the excessive fines and the jailing of thethree union officers down in Virginia,'' said Dave Evans, a Pittstonminer. ``They're going to try to shut down all the union andnon-union mines by the end of next week. You'll see a nationwide andCanadian strike _ whatever it takes to get this settled.''   Monday's strikes spread throughout UMW District 17, which has8,000 members in southern West Virginia.   Gary White, president of the West Virginia Coal Association,estimated more than 10,000 miners refused to show up for work.   Under their 1988 contract, the miners can take a 10-day``memorial period'' and walk off the job to air grievances but mustgive notice beforehand.   None of the coal companies struck Monday said they were informedthat this would be a 10-day work stoppage.   West Virginia's largest coal field employer, Consolidation Coal,immediately obtained a back-to-work order from U.S. District JudgeDennis Knapp. The order is effective until June 22, when anotherhearing is scheduled.   Consol argued that when the 250 of its 4,000 workers walked out,they violated a 1988 contract barring strikes and that the walkoutcould keep the company from meeting contracts. The UMW did not sendattorneys to the hearing.   In past wildcat strikes, the first shift out was the first shiftback. It that were to hold true in this case, Consol workers wouldreturn at midnight Monday.   Pittston miners struck April 5 after working more than 14 monthswithout a contract. Pittston had refused to sign the 1988 BituminousCoal Operators Association agreement, the contract which most othercoal companies signed.   During the Pittston walkout, more than 2,200 miners, retirees andtheir wives have been arrested for acts of civil disobedience suchas blocking coal trucks.   Peabody Coal, the nation's top coal producer, had 2,360 unionminers walk out at midnight, said Tom Clarke, a Peabody attorney.   ``No reason for the unauthorized work stoppage has beencommunicated to managament,'' Clarke said. ``According to Peabodypolicy, no discussions will be held with the miners until they havereturned to work.''   Roger Caldwell, a UMW leader, said Sunday's crowd was ``whippedup'' by Trumka.   Top union leaders did not immediately return calls Monday.   Trumka could not be reached at UMW headquarters in Washington orin Charleston, where he led the 12,000-miner rally on the Capitolsteps Sunday.   ``It's time for labor to rise up and fight back,'' Trumka said atthe rally. ``The 1990s will see us resisting like we did in the'60s, in the streets, in the hallways, in the corridors of power.''</TEXT></DOC>
