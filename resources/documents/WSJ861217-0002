After a confirmation hearing in federal bankruptcy court in New York, which ended late last night, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland said the plan meets the statutory requirements for confirmation. The judge said he would issue a formal ruling and opinion that would address objections tomorrow.    The big building and forest products concern filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code in 1982 after being swamped with thousands of lawsuits claiming death or disease from asbestos, a mineral once widely used in piping and insulation.    Before Manville emerges from court protection, however, it must get final orders from the courts barring punitive damages and an injunction barring asbestos-related suits from being filed against the company. Such orders likely would be appealed, which would delay Manville's emergence from Chapter 11.    Asbestos health claimants, property damage claimants, commercial creditors and holders of preferred all had approved the plan. Holders of common, whose stake stands to be diluted as much as 98%, voted against the proposal. But under bankruptcy law, a plan can be confirmed without their approval.    The central part of Manville's plan is a trust fund to pay current and future asbestos victims an estimated $2.5 billion over the next three decades. The trust will be funded with $615 million of insurance; $200 million of cash, receivables and a note; and 50% to 80% of Manville's common stock. And, starting four years after Manville emerges, the company will funnel $75 million a year to pay $1.8 billion of bonds and will put 20% of its profits into the trust.    Manville also is establishing a $125 million no-fault trust to pay percentages of property damage claims that ask the company to pay for removing building products that contain asbestos. The company faces about $89 billion of property damage claims.    Manville's commercial creditors will receive 100% of their principal through $247.5 million in cash and a $225 million bond payable over 4 1/2 years. They will receive a portion of interest through common stock, warrants and a bond.    Holders of Manville's $5.40 preferred will get 2.16 common shares plus one share of a new Series B preferred for each preferred share.    Under Chapter 11, a company is protected from creditor lawsuits while it tries to work out a plan to pay its debts. </TEXT></DOC>
