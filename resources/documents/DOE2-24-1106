<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-24-1106 </DOCNO><TEXT>UK NIREX Ltd has a programme to study the most suitable disposal optionsfor intermediate level wastes. One of these studies is examining thefeasibility of disposing of solid wastes in repositories beneath thesea-bed, off-shore of the British Isles, the repositories being accessedfrom structures sited off-shore and the waste being transported acrossthe sea. The initial purpose has been to identify preferred disposaloptions for which preliminary designs will be prepared in a subsequentphase. The study has established the state of the art with respect tothe construction and operation of three basic repository concepts, borehole-shaft,tunnel/cavern accessed via a shaft; and sub-seabed trench. It has alsoaddressed the logistics of sea transport for various transport containerand ship sizes and has compared the radiological detriment associatedwith these transport options. It is concluded that there is likely tobe significant benefit from utilising the ability to transport by seavery large packages of waste (circa 2000T) in order to reduce radiologicaldose to transport and handling operatives. It is also concluded thatof the sub-seabed options considered in this study very large cavernsaccessed by narrow shafts from off-shore structures appear to providethe best containment for radionuclides consistent with the multi-barrierapproach and the ALARA principle.</TEXT></DOC>
