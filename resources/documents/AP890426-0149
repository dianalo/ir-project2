On U.S. markets, the average return for the four years _ thevalue of the stocks themselves plus dividents _ would have been atame $1,910.   Manila showed the best average return worldwide in a study bythe International Finance Corporation, which looked at stockmarkets in both major money centers and 31 Third World countries.   The corporation, owned by 133 governments, is the agency of theWorld Bank that lends to private industry.   The corporation's Charles O. Sethness said the large gain in thevalue of stocks on the stocks on the Manila exchange ``was all dueto the instability until (former President Ferdinand) Marcos left.''   The Manila exchange jogged along through 1985 without muchchange, despite the violent political campaign that led to thevictory of President Corazon Aquino, but took off after Marcos flewto exile in Hawaii in February 1986.   By June 1987, the average return on stocks had reached a levelnearly 16 times the level of 1985.   There was a sharp drop in Manila when markets worldwide crashedin October 1987. But, by the end of last year, total returns wereback almost to their peak.   Returns on stock in the Third World seem to have little to dowith a country's prosperity. According to the World Bank, theaverage Filipino had an annual income of only $590 in 1987, aslight increase after a decline of several years. The country hasan active Communist insurgency and a $30 billion debt.   An investor in the market of relatively prosperous South Koreawould have done well, but only a little more than half as well asin the Philippines. His $1,000 would have turned into $7,890 in thefour years.   In the southern African republic of Zimbabwe headed by PresidentRobert Mogabe, a professed Marxist, the return would have been onlya little less, $7,320.   The survey does not cover other countries where governments callthemselves socialist but are experimenting with capitalism.Sethness said a market in Shanghai deals only in what he considerspreferred stocks, while in Budapest the trading has been largely inbonds. He reported that the Yugoslav government has been consultingwith the corporation on the possibiity of opening a market but hasnot yet done so.   Brazil turned in the best market performance in 1988 althoughthe country has the Third World's largest debt and inflation wasrunning at more than 1,000 percent by the end of the year. Thehottest stock was Acesita, a steel company, which chalked up areturn of $8,313 for shares worth $1,000 at the start of the year.   As in any market, investors can lose their shirts on Third Worldexchanges. Stock prices were mostly down last year in southernEurope and Africa, by 37 percent in Turkey and Venezuela and by 25percent in Portugal.</TEXT></DOC>
