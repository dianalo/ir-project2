(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A small airplane slammed into a freewaySaturday, killing all three men aboard and shutting the highwaydown for hours. A second plane crash in California claimed twocollege students' lives.   The single-engine Cessna 172 crashed on the eastbound lanes ofthe Pomona Freeway around 2:48 a.m. after hitting powertransmission tower cables in this city about 15 miles east of LosAngeles, authorities said.   No cars were hit, but all lanes of the freeway were closed forseveral hours as the wreckage was carted off.   In the other crash, a rented single-engine Cessna 152 went downin fog Friday night near the abandoned Port San Luis lighthousealmost 150 miles northwest of Los Angeles, officials said.   The three El Monte victims had identification indicating theyworked for McDonnell Douglas Corp. in Long Beach, said fire Capt.Robert Pasqua.   They were Orville Stoll III, 33, of Buena Park; Vu Hoang, 26, ofHuntington Beach; and Mahmoud Abulkheir, 30 of Long Beach, said L.Shelton, supervising investigator at the Los Angeles Countycoroner's office.   Abulkheir was still alive when firefighters pried him out of theaircraft, but he died at the Greater El Monte Community Hospital,said county fire Inspector Joe Silva. It was not known who waspiloting the plane.   The plane hit static wires, which sit above power lines andprotect them by deflecting lightning, said Los Angelese Departmentof Water and Power spokeswoman Dorothy Jensen.   The aircraft was registered in Buena Park, but it was not knownwhere it was heading or where it had departed from, said FederalAviation Administration duty officer Jerry Acosta.   There were differing reports on what may have caused the crash,Acosta said.   Pasqua said the plane apparently lost power, and said one of theplane's two fuel tanks was empty.   The crash near the lighthouse occurred near Avila Beach in fogaround 9:15 p.m. Friday, and may have involved engine failure,according to San Luis Obispo County sheriff's Sgt. Joe Nungaray.
