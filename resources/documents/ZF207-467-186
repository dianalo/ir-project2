DelliBovi last month required program managersto use the Automated Audit Management System (AAMS).andP;  He also designatedDonna Abbenante as departmental liaison to ensure compliance with thedirective.andM;These moves will &quot;clear the backlog of outstanding recommendations andunderscore our strong commitment to the audit follow-up process,&quot; DeliBovisaid.andM;Ron Hommas, a HUD auditor who helped develop AAMS, said auditors have usedthe system since 1981, but department managers largely have ignored the auditrecommendations.andM;&quot;We've always had that information [audit recommendations], always known it,always provided these reports to the managers.andP;  They just didn't pay anyattention to it,&quot; he said.andM;DelliBovi told program managers that as of May 31, there were 42 auditreports with 258 recommendations that were over six months old and in whichno management decision had been made.andP;  These audit reports andrecommendations included more than $13 million in questioned costs and $10.8million in potential cost efficiecies.andM;In addition, there was 142 audit reports and 305 recommendations where amanagement decision had been made more than a year ago but final action hadnot been completed.andP;  These audit reports and recommendations contained morethan $52.2 million in disallowed costs not collected and more than $10.7million in sustained cost efficiencies not yet implemented.andM;Before 1981, HUD auditors maintained a paper file of audit findings andrecommendations, which one auditor described as &quot;inefficient.&quot;andM;AAMS is used to track audit findings and recommendations from the first timethey are included in audit reports through the resolution processesstipulated by Congress in the Inspector General Act of 1988.andM;HUD Assistant Inspector General for Audit Chris Greer said, AAMS &quot;isbasically a management information system to track audit findings and theirresolutions and to automatically gig people if they haven't responded withinthe time frames.&quot;andM;Hommas said AAMS runs on a Unisys Corp. 1190X mainframe computer at HUDheadquarters in Washington.andP;  It has batch update overnight processingcapability.andP;  It is linked to HUD's 10 regional audit offices via a networkfrom Telenet Communications Corp. of Reston, Va.andP;  Systems coordinators ineach regional office access AAMS through Honeywell Inc. DPS-6 minicomputers.andM;&quot;AAMS allows you to go in at any time and get a quick and dirty report fromthe database, and it can produce ad hoc reports and edit audit reports,&quot;Hommas said.andM;DelliBovi also directed HUD program managers to review a list of outstandingaudit reports for their programs and complete a status report by June 30.andO;The status reports were to include a target date for either making amanagement decision or taking final action.andM;&quot;We've gotten all the audits in.andP;  He [DelliBovi] had given them a deadline ofJune 30 and every single one of them is in.andP;  The response to his letters areall in from every field and headquarters office.andP;  We've never gotten thatkind of response here before,&quot; Abbenante said.andM;Before assuming her new position, Abbenante was special assistant to HUD'sassistant secretary for Community Planning and Development.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
