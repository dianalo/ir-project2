MEARS</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE><DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Michael Dukakis will be campaigning on aDemocratic platform so brief that some voters might actually readit _ and so generalized that even if they do it probably won't hurthis ticket.   Both are departures from the book-length platforms Democrats hadtaken to writing in efforts to cater to every faction in theircoalition. That kind of platform-making was futile at best, andwhat they said was sometimes used against them.   They produced catalogues of promises which Republicancampaigners cited as evidence that the Democrats were committed tospiraling spending and beholden to special interests.   It never did them much good. Nobody elects platforms, which arewidely ignored, even by the candidates who theoretically run onthem. Presidents Jimmy Carter in 1980 and Gerald R. Ford in 1976both accepted platform planks they opposed rather than riskconvention votes they might have lost.   The platform episodes were quickly forgotten. So, for thatmatter, were the platforms.   Ford lost to Carter in the 1976 election, and Carter toPresident Reagan in 1980, but not because of platforms or platformconcessions.   The Dukakis departure from the wordy promises of the recentDemocratic past actually was the handiwork of Democratic NationalChairman Paul Kirk, who urged long before the primary campaign thatthe 1988 platform be a broad statement of principles, not a wishlist for interest groups.   His plan was to avoid the kind of baggage lugged by pastDemocratic tickets. It succeeded. The new platform is a 4,500-wordstatement of Democratic tenets, longer on rhetoric than onspecifics. It carries no price tag and defies any effort to computeone.   Republicans are trying to paint Dukakis in liberal colors, butthe Democratic platform is no help. GOP campaign spokesmen said theDemocrats are just trying to cloak their liberal intentions.   ``It is the tax and spend wing that is in control,'' said Gov.John Sununu of New Hampshire. ``They have written a platform thatattempts to hide that.'' Sen. John Warner of Virginia said thevoters have ``a right to know what is being concealed behind thevague generalities.'' South Carolina Gov. Carroll Campbell said theDemocrats were trying to shield Dukakis from the liberal tag and``pulling together to help perpetuate the fraud.''   Vice President George Bush has argued that theme since it becameclear that Dukakis would be the Democratic nominee.   But the Democratic platform will supply scant ammunition.Michael Barnes, the former Maryland congressman who worked on theplatform for Dukakis, said nothing in the document ``would in anyway commit the next Congress or commit the next president, eventheoretically'' to any specific spending program.   Nor does the platform seek tax increases on business and thewealthy, as Jesse Jackson supporters wanted. Republicans never letWalter F. Mondale forget his 1984 convention statement that if hewere elected, taxes would have to be increased. They will arguethat a Dukakis administration means higher taxes, but they'll haveto make the case without a specific target this time.   Democratic platforms had been growing wordier for 20 years. Theyalso had become increasingly explicit in their promises,particularly on expensive domestic programs. Republicans won fourof the five presidential elections during those years.   By 1984, the platform was a 45,000 word compendium ofcompromises and commitments that played into the GOP strategy ofcalling the Democratic ticket a liberal captive of countlessfactions and interests.   In 1980, then-President Carter had to capitulate and accept aset of platform planks advocated by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, amongthem a commitment to a $12 billion public service jobs program.   Challenger Kennedy was short of the votes it would have taken todeny Carter renomination, but the president didn't want to riskconvention defeat on the platform. So he surrendered _ and thenannounced that he accepted only the intent, not the specifics, ofthe convention-approved platform planks. It was an overnight issue.After that, nobody noticed the discrepancy.   Four years earlier, the Republican platform effectivelyrenounced the foreign policy of the Republican administration.Ronald Reagan challenged Ford for the nomination that year, andcame close. Ford strategists feared a platform confrontation mightshake their grip on the nomination itself. So they gave the Reaganside its way on the foreign policy plank. It made no difference.   That's the story of party platforms. They don't really helpcandidates and they can arm opponents.   Hence the Democrats' streamlined new look.   Rep. William Gray of Pennsylvania, a Jackson negotiator on theplatform, said the Democrats' 1988 handiwork is ``brief, readableand understandable,'' like the Gettysburg Address and the TenCommandments.   Any comparison ends there. The political world will little notenor long remember its phrases. And the platform includes fewcommandments. The Democrats were purposefully vague about what theyshalt or shalt not do.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Walter R.
