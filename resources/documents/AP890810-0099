(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The University of South Carolina got only27 takers when it asked 2,800 incoming freshmen if they'd like tolive in a dormitory where overnight visits by the opposite sex arebanned.   But university officials are moving ahead with a policy thatrestricts opposite-sex visitation in all on-campus housing by 1992.   When classes start Aug. 28, two dorms set aside for the ban thisyear will be filled by the 27 freshmen who requested spaces plus453 who did not, either because they oppose it or are unaware ofthe policy adopted four months ago by USC's trustees.   ``We had to make a tough decision and place people in thosebuildings even though they hadn't requested it,'' said RichardWertz, USC vice president for business affairs.   USC provides housing for about 6,500 single students.   Eight women and 19 men said they wanted to live in a hallbanning overnight visits by the opposite sex.   The school adopted the rules after state Rep. Mike Fair, a USCtrustee, raised concerns over coed dorms, student privacy andcampus safety. Fair said one reason he objected to overnightvisitation was that his daughter, Meredith, planned to enroll.   The new policy sparked a few student protests. In addition, MissFair decided not to enroll after threats were made against her,apparently because of her father's role in getting the dorm policychanged.</TEXT></DOC>
