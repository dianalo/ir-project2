The Democratic nominee -- although cool and self-contained by nature -- took a sharp jab at George Bush. &quot;We're going to have a vice president who won't sit silently by when somebody at the National Security Council comes up with the cockamamie idea that we should trade arms to the ayatollah for hostages,&quot; he declared to a cheering crowd that rose to its feet. His vice president, he promised, will march into the Oval Office and tell him: &quot;This is outrageous and has to stop.&quot;    But the main thrust as he accepted the Democratic nomination here was to paint his own self-portrait in warmer hues. His address was a triumphant celebration of ethnicity, optimism and opportunity. The successful son of Greek immigrants used his own life as a metaphor for the American dream.    &quot;I know,&quot; he said, &quot;because I'm a product of that dream.&quot;    A disciplined, frugal, nuts-and-bolts kind of man, Mr. Dukakis ordinarily disdains pomp and resists packaging. But that went by the boards in planning for this special night. He was introduced by Olympia Dukakis, his Academy Award-winning actress cousin, after a video evoking his roots and traditional values -- then saluted after his speech with a dozen confetti-firing cannons and an avalanche of 15,000 balloons.    Yet the 54-year-old Massachusetts governor didn't try to out-Jackson Jesse Jackson in moving rhetoric. Nor did he offer detailed programmatic ideas vulnerable to Republican fire. Instead, the cautious and managerial Mr. Dukakis tried to humanize himself -- and to voice broad, optimistic themes appealing to the Reagan Democrats and middle-class suburbanites whose votes may be the margin between victory or defeat.    &quot;My friends, if anyone tells you that the American dream belongs to the privileged few and not to all of us, you tell them that the Reagan era is over and a new era is about to begin,&quot; he said.    Broadening his attack on Mr. Bush, the Democratic candidate went on to include the scandals, personal and institutional, that have marred the final Reagan years.    &quot;And in the Dukakis White House . . . if you accept the privilege of public service, you had better understand the responsibilities of public service,&quot; he declared. &quot;If you violate that trust, you'll be fired; if you violate the law, you'll be prosecuted; and if you sell arms to the ayatollah, don't expect a pardon from the president of the United States.&quot;    The address marked a criticial juncture in the campaign. Mr. Dukakis was trying to solidify a public image that, while generally positive, remains fuzzy. And to define himself before Mr. Bush and the Republicans do that for him.    &quot;This election isn't about ideology,&quot; he argued. &quot;It's about competence.&quot;    His address also dwelled on Mr. Dukakis's mother and his late father, whom he described as arriving at Ellis Island with $25 in his pocket. And, foreshadowing a campaign that will zero in on Hispanic voters, he broke into Spanish at one point.    Earlier, running mate Lloyd Bentsen, the courtly Texas senator, took aim at the narrower but absolutely essential task he has in the campaign: Carrying Texas, Vice President Bush's adopted home. Sen. Bentsen's text also aimed at rural America and the industrial Midwest -- which, like the Oil Patch, are suffering despite a growing national economy.    &quot;The Reagan-Bush administration likes to talk about prosperity,&quot; the senator said. &quot;But the farmers in Iowa don't hear them. The oil field workers in Texas and Oklahoma and Louisiana don't hear them. The factory workers in John Glenn's Ohio don't hear them.&quot; Mr. Dukakis considered Sen. Glenn as his running mate before settling on Sen. Bentsen; last night, Sen. Glenn introduced the Texas senator.    For the most part, Sen. Bentsen was enthusiastically received. Some delegates, however, brandished &quot;No Contra Aid&quot; signs -- a pointed reminder that while Mr. Dukakis opposes such aid, Sen. Bentsen has supported President Reagan on the issue.    Mr. Dukakis's address retained the broad themes, unencumbered by many details, that were his strength during his 16-month drive to the nomination. In that drive, he was a blank screen. Democrats of every stripe could project their hopes and dreams upon it. He was a mirror. What supporters saw in it was often themselves.    But the candidate's task now is to reach out beyond the committed -- to excite and to energize. Democratic pollsters, probing for attitudes in recent days, found voters particularly hungry for more information about the man himself.    And so last night he made a start. His unifying themes were classic middle and working-class: family and community.    &quot;. . . We are in this together,&quot; he said. &quot;. . . Regardless of who we are or where we come from or how much money we have -- each of us counts. And . . . by working together to create opportunity and a good life for all -- all of us are enriched -- not just in economic terms, but as citizens and human beings.&quot;    The ceremony was crafted to reinforce those themes. First the crowded convention hall heard a newly composed fanfare performed by the Boston Pops -- and directed by Harry Ellis Dickson, who is the father of Kitty Dukakis. Then it watched the video, narrated by Olympia Dukakis, that took the nation on a tour of the Dukakis neighborhood and home -- right down to the battered hulk of a snowblower, 25 years old. Then, framed by spotlights, Mr. Dukakis wound his way through the delegates. He moved to the driving beat of Neil Diamond's &quot;Coming to America,&quot; a song filled with immigrant hope and aspiration. And as he spoke, the exuberant Democrats broke into repeated cheers: &quot;We're going to win!&quot; and &quot;Let's go, Mike!&quot;    The candidate took pains to compliment the rival who stayed in the marathon longest and pushed him the hardest, the Rev. Jesse Jackson. Mr. Jackson, he said, is &quot;a man whose very candidacy says to every child -- aim high; to every citizen -- you count; to every voter -- you can make a difference; to every American -- you are a full shareholder in our dream.&quot;    His pains were rewarded. Television cameras caught the face of a beaming Mr. Jackson. And when Mr. Dukakis's 46-minute address had ended -- as the confetti and the balloons rained down and jubilant delegates waved an estimated 10,000 American flags -- Mr. Jackson, his wife and family joined the Dukakis and Bentsen families on the platform.    And still the unity celebration kept broadening. Former rivals -- Illinois Sen. Paul Simon, Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt, Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore, and former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt joined the group on the platform. They were followed by ex-President Jimmy Carter and his wife Rosalynn, then Walter and Joan Mondale, then Sen. Edward Kennedy -- and more. Twenty minutes after the Dukakis speech had ended, the delegates were still cheering and singing -- and showed little inclination to stop. </TEXT></DOC>
