The gunmen earlier threatened to blow up the Kuwait AirwaysBoeing 747 and demanded that the runway at Mashhad airport innortheastern Iran be cleared, the Islamic Republic News Agencyreported. IRNA said that the taxiway had been closed ``to preventthe plane from flying.''   ``Disciplinary and relief forces are on full alert while thesituation is presently out of control and anything may happen atany moment,'' said IRNA, monitored in Nicosia. It said an Iraniandelegation in contact with the hijackers was advising them to``keep cool.''   The shooting erupted after the hijackers demanded that the planebe refueled and allowed to take off for an undisclosed destination,IRNA said. Iran had refused.   The agency did not mention any casualties in the gunfire.   Earlier, IRNA reported that ``Iranian officials have announcedthey would supply the hijackers with food and fuel provided thatthe passengers and crew members be released.''   But the refueling went ahead without any release being reported.   The hijackers have demanded that Kuwait free 17 convictedpro-Iranian extremists.   A member of the Kuwait royal family held on the plane appealedto Iranian authorities to provide the plane with fuel to take off.   ``We're very tired and our brothers (the hijackers) are veryserious in their threat to blow up the plane,'' Fadel KhaledAl-Sabah told the control tower by radio, IRNA said.   The Iranian agency said officials at Mashhad Airport innortheast Iran ``urged the hijackers to give up their threats,''   The hijackers forced the Kuwait Airways airliner to land Tuesdayafter seizing it on a flight from Bangkok to Kuwait.   The hijackers, armed with grenades and guns, are holding about50 hostages, including three members of Kuwait's royal family.Fifty-seven people have been freed since the plane landed,including 32 released early today.   Austrian passenger Josef Degeorgi, released today, said theseven gunmen were brutal when they seized the plane but latertreated the hostages well. British passenger Jean Sifton, who wasfreed Wednesday, said two of the hijackers had offered her pillowsand drinks and chatted with her daughters.   IRNA quoted Iran's deputy prime minister, Ali Reza Moayerri, assaying failure to negotiate an end to the hijack drama could ``Godforbid, lead to unpredictable events.''   It quoted him as saying the Kuwaiti negotiators sent to Mashhadairport in northeastern Iran appeared to ``attach no importance tothe lives of their own citizens'' aboard the plane.   Moayerri, in charge of negotiating with the hijackers, wasquoted as saying: ``While we're trying to put an immediate end tothe hijacking, the Kuwait delegation seems to have no authority tomake any decision here.''   The hijackers warned in an ultimatum radioed to the Mashhadtower that they would blow up the jet if there was ``any threatagainst the plane'' by Iranian security forces, IRNA said. IRNA didnot say if the hijackers indicated where they planned to fly to.   The warning came after senior Kuwaiti officials at the airportsaid they would negotiate only after the remaining hostages stillbeing held were released. The remaining hostages were believed toall be Arabs, including at least 30 Kuwaitis.   IRNA said the hijackers declared in statement:   ``We give the Kuwaitis until noon (4:30 a.m. EDT) and if they donot give a positive reply to our demand, we will leave Mashhadairport.   ``We warn that we will not tolerate any threat against the planeand declare we are ready to blow it up.''   Earlier today, the hijackers singled out the three members ofthe Kuwaiti royal family, two of them women, who they said will beamong the first passengers ``to pay a dear price'' if Kuwait doesnot meet their demand.   The hijackers are demanding the release of 17 pro-Iranianextremists imprisoned in Kuwait for bombing the U.S. and Frenchembassies in that Persian Gulf state in 1983.   Kuwait rejected the demand, calling it ``blackmail.''   The nationality of the hijackers was not known. Hostages whohave been freed said there are five or six hijackers, all wearingmasks.   Twenty-four female hostages were released on Wednesday and aJordanian man with a heart ailment was freed on Tuesday.   The members of the Kuwait royal family aboard are Al-Sabah, abusinessman, and his sisters, Ebtesam and Anware.   Release of the 17 jailed extremists has been a recurring demandof Shiite fundamentalist groups loyal to Iranian Ayatollah RuhollahKhomeini that are believed to hold most of the 22 Western hostagesin Lebanon.   Many acts of terrorism in Kuwait have been blamed on ShiiteMoslems acting for Iran, which has been at war with Iraq sinceSeptember 1980 and accuses the sheikdom of aiding Iraq.</TEXT></DOC>
