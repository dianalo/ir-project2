The draft resolution, to be discussed when the council meetsTuesday, expresses outrage at the banning of anti-apartheidactivities and concern for the ``worsening of the human sufferingresulting from the apartheid system'' of racial segregation.   The resolution says South Africa's intransigence ``compels theinternational community to impose, as a first step, selectivemandatory sanctions.''   Under South Africa's system of apartheid, the 26 million blackshave no voice in national affairs and the 5 million whites controlthe economy and maintain separate schools and districts.   The resolution, circulated after three days of debate, calls fora halt to export and sale of oil to South Africa; an end to furtherinvestment and loans; a ban on imports of iron and steel; a halt ofall trade promotion and support for trade; prohibition of sale ofKruggerands and all coins minted in South Africa; and cessation ofall forms of military, policy or intelligence cooperation,especially the sale of computer equipment.   South African U.N. Ambassador Leslie Manley told the SecurityCouncil on Thursday, ``We will not bow to your threats or demandsand we reject your accusations with contempt and invite you to doyour damnedest.''   The resolution calls for all U.N. members to back the sanctionsand report progress to the secretary-general. It establishes aSecurity Council committee to monitor implementation.   Security Council resolutions can be vetoed by any one of itspermanent members _ the United States, Great Britain, China, Franceand the Soviet Union. The Council and the U.N. General Assemblyhave condemned South Africa in the past, but the United States andother countries have opposed sanctions.   The resolution says the sanctions would remain in force for oneyear, after which the council again will meet to determine if SouthAfrica has abolished apartheid.   The proposed measures also require South Africa to lift the banon anti-apartheid political activities, release all politicalprisoners, allow the free and safe return of exiles and commencedialogue with leaders of the majority black population.   The draft resolution was submitted by Algeria, Argentina, Nepal,Senegal, Yugoslavia and Zambia.</TEXT></DOC>
