A research-and-development group has begun designing a high-speed ship that uses superconducting motors to turn its propellers. The ship, if successful, will carry freight containers and whisk along at 60 miles an hour, cutting to four days the current two-week trip from Tokyo to the American West Coast.    &quot;The impact could be huge,&quot; says Noboru Hamada, president of the Japan Marine Machinery Development Association. The association, Yokohama University and Sumitomo Heavy Industries Ltd. will design and build the vessel.    The ship illustrates the extent to which Japanese companies have already invested in commercial applications of superconductors, an investment that industry officials on both sides of the Pacific think gives Japan a leg up on the West in exploiting the breakthrough class of ceramic superconductors emerging from labs in the U.S., Japan and elsewhere.    Indeed, even more radical superconducting ships are in the works in Japanese labs, but not in U.S. labs. Several Japanese shipbuilders have joined forces to build ships that use superconducting magnets, instead of propellers, to propel the vessels. That technology, concludes a recent study by the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, &quot;could lead to revolutionary advances in marine propulsion.&quot;    Superconductors, which carry electricity with no resistance when cooled to low temperatures, use very little energy and can be built into smaller and far more powerful motors and magnets than conventional materials. Japan's ship designs use traditional superconductors: metal-alloys that must be cooled with expensive liquid helium to minus 269 degrees Celsius. The new ceramic superconductors discovered in 1986 must be cooled in liquid nitrogen only to about minus 150 degrees, a vast improvement in cost and efficiency over present superconductors. But they haven't been refined for heavy use.    Engineers working on seafaring superconductors concede that the ship-propulsion technology is still largely unproven. &quot;This is the sort of thing people have been dreaming about,&quot; says Peter Rawle, a technology analyst at SBCI Securities (Asia) Ltd. But &quot;it's very, very experimental,&quot; he says.    Still, Japanese industry officials are confident they will get the jump on any commercial applications of the new superconductors because they are investing heavily in commercial uses for the older conductors. Companies such as Toshiba Corp. and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. make superconducting magnets for Japan's magnetically propelled train prototype. They are also involved in a government project to use superconducting coils in electric-power plants.    &quot;They have that know-how down,&quot; says an American scientist in Tokyo. &quot;There's no question that it's an advantage.&quot;    The Sumitomo ship, until now largely kept out of the public eye, is based on experiments begun in 1979. Sumitomo, Yokohama University and the association built 50-horsepower and 650-horsepower scale models before beginning design this year of a 650-foot prototype vessel they will build in the early 1990s. The ship, whose superconducting motors will be far smaller than conventional electric or diesel engines, will also feature a streamlined hull for high speeds.    Japan's shipbuilders hope the technology will help pry Japan's shipbuilding industry out of the doldrums caused by competition from Third World shipyards. Says Mr. Hamada of the marine-machinery association: &quot;The objective is to take some freight away from the airlines.&quot;    A more radical design, using what is called magnetohydrodynamic propulsion, effectively turns sea water into part of an electric motor. Toshiba, Mitsubishi and Kobe Steel Ltd. this year began designing a prototype of a ship whose underside will sport two tubes shaped like jet engines. Electric terminals run current through the water inside the tube. Superconducting magnets in the tube's walls then force the charged water backwards through the tube, forcing the boat forward.    The 150-ton experimental vessel, named Yamato I after a famous World War II battleship, is based on a scale model the companies floated this year. &quot;It isn't something that's going to be commercialized in two or three years,&quot; says a Toshiba official. &quot;But as high-temperature superconductor materials improve, it will come closer to commercialization.&quot;    Indeed, Yamato I is part of a much grander plan by Japanese government and industry to build full-sized superconducting ships and submarines to replace conventional vessels by the early 21st century.    The first work in superconducting ship propulsion was done by an American named Owen Phillips in the early 1960s. The U.S. Navy still maintains a small project, much like Sumitomo's, to develop superconducting motors to power conventional ship propellers, but other projects were abandoned in the 1960s as impractical. The motors would require bulky refrigeration equipment.    But the recent discovery of superconductors that don't require as much refrigeration has heated up interest in the ships both in Japan and the U.S. The recent naval laboratory study concludes that superconducting propulsion would provide ships and submarines that are far quieter, lighter and faster than conventional vessels.    &quot;The recent dramatic developments in high-temperature superconducting materials . . . now make it desirable to reconsider (magnetohydrodynamic) propulsion,&quot; the report says.    Some applications: underwater tankers and super-quiet submarines. &quot;The use of magnetohydrodynamic propulsion for ocean-going vessels,&quot; the study says, &quot;provides potential for advances in ship performance analogous to the advances in aircraft performance which followed from the development of the jet engine.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
