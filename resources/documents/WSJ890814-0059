The voluntary plan, drafted recently by Drexel and the North American Securities Administrators Association, an organization of U.S. and Canadian securities commissioners, would allow Drexel to continue operating freely in the states despite its record as an admitted felon. It also is likely to allow the states to avoid time-consuming and costly investigations into Drexel's activities when their treasuries are strapped for cash.    In April, Drexel agreed to pay $650 million and plead guilty to six felony counts related to a federal insider-trading investigation. The plea agreement was made in conjunction with a broad settlement of securities-law violations with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Because the firm agreed that it committed felonies, securities commissioners in most states can automatically revoke Drexel's license to do business.    While some states, including New York and California, still are reviewing Drexel's status, 24 states have said either that they will settle with Drexel or that they favor the plan, people familiar with the negotiations between Drexel and the states said. Drexel said it already has paid $975,000 in fines to 10 states and expects to pay $11.5 million as part of its goal to operate freely across the U.S. and set an industry standard for securities-law compliance.    Drexel also plans to contribute funds to establish a foundation that would promote securities regulations and ethics in the securities industry. &quot;It's very important that good things come out of this,&quot; said Saul S. Cohen, whose appointment as Drexel's general counsel in April was approved by the SEC as part of the firm's agreement to settle insider-trading charges.    Mr. Cohen, who is leading Drexel's effort to reach settlements with the states, said in an interview: &quot;There's a realization that Drexel has to work hard to restore the confidence of the nation and the firm. This is one of the ways you do it.&quot;    On Friday, for example, Drexel agreed to pay $100,000 to the Arkansas Securities Department even though the state said it hasn't any evidence the firm did anything wrong and despite the fact that Drexel hasn't had an office in the state for at least four years. &quot;The incentive here is to avoid us revoking or suspending their license,&quot; said Beverly Bassett, the state's securities commissioner. &quot;This will sort of hold that in abeyance even if the felony convictions don't relate to activities in Arkansas, because (Drexel is) registered in the state and we don't look kindly on licensees having felony convictions.&quot;    In addition, Drexel has paid fines and settled with Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Maryland, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Vermont and Wyoming. &quot;I'm very proud of&quot; these settlements, Mr. Cohen said. &quot;It's a logical extension of the firm's settlement with the SEC, which was the most extensive and comprehensive in history.&quot;    As a result of its agreement with the SEC, Drexel had to make dozens of changes in its management structure and procedures to enforce compliance with federal and state securities laws.    &quot;Everyone had the expectation when the government investigation (into Drexel's activities) ended, proper sanctions would be meted out,&quot; Mr. Cohen said. &quot;We're trying to see that states are full partners with regulators in effecting the overall sanctions and controls that were envisioned in the SEC consent agreement.&quot;    Drexel's settlement with the states stems from a disciplinary agreement drafted by Drexel and a North American Securities Administrators Association committee, led by Susan Bryant, the Oklahoma securities commissioner. When the committee was formed this year, Ms. Bryant said it would determine what kind of action the states may take against Drexel and what the SEC pact covered. Although the plan between Drexel and the states resembles the SEC settlement, Ms. Bryant has said action taken by the states probably will vary.    For example, New York and California, the states where Drexel is most active, probably will take a more aggressive stance against the firm than other states do. Nevertheless, Mr. Cohen said that he expects the firm to work with New York and California regulators on a settlement and that a settlement with all 50 states &quot;could be reached&quot; within nine months.    &quot;I can't pre-empt what states already have scheduled,&quot; he said, &quot;but I'm hopeful we've made considerable progress putting some of our problems behind us.&quot;    According to a draft of the plan, Drexel's fines paid to the states have been based on the state's population and on the size of Drexel's business in the state compared with Drexel's total business before its sale of its retail brokerage operations.    Some lawyers said Drexel could set a standard for the securities industry in the way it is settling with the states. Drexel's settlements so far &quot;have some significant implications,&quot; said Harvey Pitt, a partner in Washington at the law firm of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver andamp; Jacobson. The settlements &quot;will encourage other states to take a look at Drexel and see what they can obtain,&quot; he said. &quot;States may be encouraged to take action against firms in other situations in settlements with the federal government.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
