The government-declared truce ends Thursday night, a day afterU.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz is scheduled to arrive inthe region for a round of consultations with four Central Americanpresidents.   The department called the meetings between Defense MinisterHumberto Ortega and his commanders ``extremely important.'' It saidsuch meetings are held only in extraordinary circumstances.   It gave no details. Ortega is the brother of President DanielOrtega.   The rebels, known as Contras, rejected the leftist Sandinistagovernment's offer for more peace talks, but offered to extend thetruce indefinitely.   The government who said this week that 3,000 Contra fighters hadstarted filtering across the border from Honduras, has not said ifit will prolong the fragile truce.   Both sides have accused the other of violating the agreement.   Nicaragua has been at relative peace since March 23, when theContras and Sandinistas agreed to the first in a series ofcease-fires and peace talks.   The talks fell apart on June 9 with the two sides unable toagree on rebel disarmament and Sandinista democratic reforms.   Since then, the Sandinistas proposed a formal round of talks inManagua on a lasting peace or informal discussions on thecease-fire in Miami. The Contras rejected both offers.   The high-level military meetings came as President Ortega was onhis first official visit to Cuba.   The Sandinista newspaper Barricada said Ortega's visit will``deepen Latin America unity against the traditionally aggressivepolicies of the United States.''   In a clandestine broadcast monitored in Managua Tuesday, theContras' Radio Liberacion accused Ortega and Cuban President FidelCastro of holding ``secret talks about crushing'' Sandinistaopponents.   The Nicaraguan opposition newspaper La Prensa called Ortega'svisit to Havana ``inopportune'' and said it might encourage theUnited States to resume military aid to the Contras.   Cuba gave Ortega its highest award Monday night, the Order ofJose Marti.   In his acceptance speech, Ortega said the Sandinistas ``willnever sacrifice our revolutionary democratic process, even if (theUnited States) orders new terrorist actions against Nicaragua.''   He said that while the Sandinistas intend to continue ``fightingand confronting Yankee aggression energetically,'' they still wantto find a ``negotiated end to the conflict imposed on us by theUnited States.''   The United States has been funding the Contras since 1981, twoyears after the Sandinistas took power. The war has killed morethan 26,000 people and has wrecked the Nicaraguan economy.   Shultz is leaving Wednesday afternoon for Guatemala City. Heends his Central American visit Friday, after consulting withofficials from Guatemala, Costa Rica, Honduras and El Salvador.</TEXT></DOC>
