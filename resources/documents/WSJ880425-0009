The dollar's relative stability in the first quarter, coupled with consistently better economic growth projections, allowed Swiss share prices to recover slowly, but steadily, in the past few months. Most analysts expect that trend to continue in the second quarter.    While Swiss share prices have risen about 10% to 12% since mid-January, their average price level still lies roughly 30% below the level before last October's crash, according to a Bank Sarasin andamp; Cie report. Viewed fundamentally, the Swiss share market is about 20% undervalued, the report said.    The Credit Suisse stock index ended at 446.8 Friday, up 9.8% from 406.6 on Jan. 4, but down 30.7% from its pre-crash high of 644.9 on Oct. 5, 1987.    Caution remains the watchword in conservative Switzerland. As a Bank Sarasin report noted: &quot;Nobody can state categorically whether a recession can be avoided and when a possible economic setback is to be expected; the data that have so far become known are too contradictory.&quot;    Additionally, analysts are concerned that foreign investors, who pulled out of the market after the October crash, haven't returned fully.    Those nagging uncertainties mean the market will continue to favor shares with &quot;relatively low sensitivity to the economic cycle, rock-solid balance sheets and advanced production technology,&quot; according to Claudio Werder, financial analyst for Bank Vontobel.    In other words, analysts are counseling foreign as well as Swiss investors to focus on blue-chip issues with high earning power and a sound backing of material assets.    Investors' best bets in the second quarter include chemical and pharmaceuticals stocks and insurance titles, analysts say. Selected other blue chips, including Holderbank Financiere Glarus and Nestle, could also provide good investment opportunities, they note.    Switzerland's big banks, normally topping analysts' lists, have lost some of their appeal, with most analysts predicting stagnant results at best in 1988. Bank shares are still considered a good low-risk buy for long-term investors, but shorter-term investors are being counseled to look elsewhere.    The stocks of the big Swiss pharmaceutical and chemical firms -- Sandoz, F. Hoffmann-La Roche and Ciba-Geigy -- should continue to outperform the market in the coming months, Mr. Werder said in a recent report. The three have implemented extensive reorganization programs, boosted research and development efforts and sped up the rate of new product launches.    Analysts predict that the pharmaceuticals' need for more foreign investment will force them to adopt more U.S.-style financial reporting practices and perhaps simplify their equity structures, making their stocks more attractive to both foreign and Swiss investors.    World Market Activity   Stock prices topped the 27000-point level in an active half-day of trading in Tokyo Saturday, buoyed by an overnight rally on Wall Street, analysts said.    On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei stock average, which gained 8.96 points Friday, surged 221.25 points to close at 27058.37. It was the Nikkei's second-highest close since April 14, when it was 27111.35. Volume on the first section was a moderate 470 million shares.    In early trading Monday on the Tokyo exchange, the Nikkei index continued to surge and ended the morning session above its best-ever close at the end of a full day's trade. The index rose 173.47 to 27231.84. Traders cited the firmer dollar and bullish sentiment stemming from Saturday's performance.    Yoshio Shimayama, a trader with Nikko Securities, attributed the favorable showing to the growing Japanese economy, saying, &quot;The market is looking at the state of business in Japan, which is very favorable. The major recovery in share prices in New York overnight is also driving the market, and the overall mood of investors here is very strong.&quot;    In London, share prices closed lower Friday as buying interest dwindled to a standstill at the end of the two-week trading account.    The Financial Times 30-share index finished 11.8 points lower at 1411.6. The 100-share index closed down 20.3 points at 1771.6. Volume was an unusually strong 514.9 million shares, compared with Thursday's 397.9 million shares.    Although the Dow Jones Industrial Average opened stronger Friday, the London market largely ignored Wall Street's firmer start.    Frankfurt share prices were mixed to higher after extremely thin trading. Analysts said the slight rise in prices didn't indicate a trend as investors remain skeptical about the market's prospects in the face of expectations of firmer U.S. interest rates.    Elsewhere, shares closed lower in Zurich, Brussels, Amsterdam and Milan, higher in Paris and mixed in Stockholm.    Among Pacific markets, stocks closed mixed in Sydney, higher in Hong Kong, Singapore, Wellington, Seoul, and Manila and lower in Taipei.    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100.
