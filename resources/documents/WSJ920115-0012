The trustee called the FDIC's action &quot;fraudulent&quot; and saidthat as a result of the FDIC's actions the estate has beenunable to pay the lawful claims of BNE's creditors of morethan $700 million.</LP><TEXT>   Such suits wouldn't be possible under new banking laws,which give regulators explicit authority to force a bankholding company to pump funds into ailing subsidiaries.Although the actions in the BNE case took place before thelaw was passed, a Supreme Court ruling last month tacitlyapproved the practice.   The suit alleges that the FDIC, the Comptroller of theCurrency and the Federal Reserve &quot;effectively stripped {theholding company} of the bulk of its valuable assets&quot; bycausing it to transfer most of the assets to its troubledBank of New England unit and then &quot;manufacturing theinsolvency&quot; of two other subsidiaries, Connecticut NationalBank andamp; Trust Co. and Maine National Bank.   An FDIC spokeswoman said officials hadn't seen the suitand couldn't comment.   Regulators knew in 1989 that BNE would fail, the suitsays, but it was kept alive and a planned bankruptcy filingwas delayed in order to complete an asset transfer anddisposition program meant to lower the cost of the ultimatefailure to FDIC. A bankruptcy filing would have stopped thetransfers.   The bank was declared insolvent by the FDIC last Jan. 6and forced into a Chapter 7 bankruptcy the next day. It wassold by FDIC to Fleet/Norstar Financial Group Inc.,Providence, R.I., last July.</TEXT></DOC>
