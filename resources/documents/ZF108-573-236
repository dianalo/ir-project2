(The PracticalNetworker) (column)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Strom, David.andM;</AUTHOR><SUMMARY>Although the cost of fiber optic cabling is considerably higherthan that of conventional unshielded twisted pair, it may well beworth the price in the long run.andP;  Fiber optic cabling will addabout $50,000 to $60,000 to the cost of wiring an office.andO;However, divided over an average lease of 10 years, the costbecomes somewhat less imposing.andP;  What is more, if a companychooses to install conventional wiring and if the throughput needsof a firm's computers outstrip what that cabling is able tosupply, the rewiring costs will be significant.andP;  All of thesefactors contribute to making fiber optic wiring a viablenetworking media for the foreseeable future.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Fiber opticsLocal Area NetworksNetwork ManagementCost.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>If you think having more fiber in your network diet is too costly, thinkagain.andM;You might be able to make a case to your facilities people if you prepareyour justification right.andM;For example, let's say a corporation is moving its offices to a new building.andO;A 10-year lease will be signed, so cabling that will function for that amountof time is needed.andM;The network manager puts together three different wiring scenarios andsolicits three bids from electrical contractors.andP;  Each scenario requires 12unshielded twisted pairs of copper wire for telephone and some data wiring,including support for printers, modem lines and other auxiliary equipment.andM;In addition, each scenario specifies the necessary faceplates, patch panelsand distribution panels needed to connect the wires to more than 150 offices.andO;Network adapter cards or hubs are not included in the bids, however.andM;The first scenario adds IBM type 1 wiring, which has two shielded pairs, tothe base set of 12 unshielded pairs.andP;  The second scenario adds RG58 coaxial,and the third one adds fiber.andP;  For each scenario, type 1, coax or fiber wouldrun to each office location.andM;Conventional wisdom says that fiber is more expensive, and this would beborne out in the contractors' proposals.andP;  The extra cost of fiber wouldprobably be between $50,000 and $60,000, depending on the electricalcontractor.andM;The parent company, however, may be a bit touchy about forking over all thisextra cash for fiber.andM;Here is my attempt at putting together a justification for the expenditure,just in case you find yourself in a similar situation.andM;-- What are the expected uses of the local area network?andM;Right now, the company's local area network is used mostly for sending mailand storing files.andP;  Performance is adequate for the company's current needs.andM;However, the company's future plans call for sending larger, multimegabytefiles around the network.andM;Although I can't test this out now, I bet dollars to doughnuts that thetransfer speed of these larger files will slow down on the existing copperwiring.andP;  Not to mention that voice, video and who knows whatever else couldrun over fiber.andM;-- What is the expected lifetime of the wiring?andM;As mentioned earlier, the company plans on being in the building for 10years.andM;If you take the extra cost of $50,000 for fiber, and divide by 10, you getsomething on the order of buying a single PC workstation per year.andM;Plus, look at how far personal computer networks have come in the last 10years and think how fast the industry is moving.andP;  Is it worth investing thecost equivalent of a single workstation per year to have the flexibility andfunctionality of fiber in the walls?andP;  I think it is.andM;-- What is the cost of rewiring?andM;In all three scenarios, the cost of the actual wiring is less than half thetotal costs, the rest being the labor to do the job.andM;For example, the additional labor cost for fiber in one case might be no morethan $2,000 more than the more expensive copper scenario, or less than 10percent more costly.andM;In a more expensive case, the additional labor cost might be an additional 20percent.andP;  Again, a small price to pay for the added flexibility.andM;If the company had to rewire the building sometime during the 10-year lease,you can be sure that the eventual cost would be much more than thisincremental 10 percent or 20 percent.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
