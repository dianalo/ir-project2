Office of Thrift Supervision:                                                                                                          As in an initial matter, the court wishes to comment thatthis is not a case involving an infamous or notorious savingsand loan association, the likes of which the public hasrecently become more than familiar. This is not a caseinvolving fraud, corruption, or self-dealing by themanagement or directors of Franklin. There has been noallegation or even hint of illegal or unethical conduct byFranklin's management or directors. Essentially, this caseboils down to a dispute over accounting practices.   {From footnote one; see below for extracts from theLincoln case.} The court has reviewed defendant's recentsubmission of additional authority, Lincoln Savings andamp; Loan.The court finds this authority of little value or guidance tothe present case. The facts established in Lincoln show clearjustification for the regulator's actions. Here, unlike inLincoln, the directors and management of Franklin have notabused their position and have not been looting theinstitution. Each case must be resolved on its own factualsituation.                                                                                                          General Background                                                                                                          Ernest F. Fleischer served as chairman of the board ofFranklin Savings Association until the appointment ofconservator on February 16, 1990. Franklin discovered that ithad economic losses in place that ranged from $40-60 million.To address these losses, Franklin retained Dr. Wayne Angell,then a professor of economics and finance at OttawaUniversity in Ottawa, Kansas. Dr. Angell was retained todetermine whether Franklin could earn back the losses alreadyin place and continue to operate as a profitable business.   In 1981 Dr. Angell determined that Franklin could earn asafe profit on the purchase of Government National MortgageAssociation (&quot;GNMA&quot;) mortgage backed securities (&quot;MBS&quot;). Dr.Angell's analysis indicated that these securities could bepurchased at a value that far exceeded the cost of funds tocarry those assets.   Franklin initially used Smith, Breeden's services to hedgethe maturity mismatch between its assets and liabilities. Inthis hedging program if interest rates increased, Franklinwould experience gains from its positions in the futuresmarket which would be used to offset its increased cost forfunding deposit liabilities at a new higher rate of interest.Conversely, if interest rates declined, the losses sufferedin the futures market would be offset by the gains from therepricing of the liabilities.   In late 1986, Franklin began the search to hire anindividual to lead and develop a research division, in house,at Franklin. The research division was to replace theservices that had been provided by Smith, Breeden. In thefall of 1987, John Scowcroft began working at Franklin. Mr.Scowcroft had formerly been the head of the researchdepartment at Merrill Lynch.   Mr. Scowcroft successfully assembled a highly skilled andtalented cadre of professionals in Franklin's newly createdresearch department. This department was comprised ofindividuals having Ph.D.s in finance and economics andM.B.A.s, and having practical experience at many of the topfinance and brokerage firms in the nation. These individualsincluded Massoud Heidari, who had a Ph.D. from MIT inengineering and who had previously worked at First Boston;Steve Hotopp, who had a Ph.D. from the University ofIllinois; and Dick Kazarian, who had a M.B.A. from theUniversity of Chicago and who had worked at Drexel. All theseindividuals worked on developing Franklin's computer models.Franklin also recruited Liz Kearns, M.B.S. Farleigh DickinsonUniversity, who had worked at Merrill Lynch and Standard andPoor. Ms. Kearns was hired to work with liability management.Ramine Rouhani, Ph.D. from Stanford in engineering andeconomics, had worked at Goldman Sachs and CitiCorp, and washired by Franklin to work with management, hedge analysis andinterest rate models. Furthermore, Franklin was successful inrecruiting Michael Smirlock, Ph.D. from WashingtonUniversity, who had been a tenured professor at the WhartonSchool of Business. Smirlock was in charge of Franklin'sasset acquisitions. Also, Franklin hired William Marshall,Ph.D. from Washington University. Mr. Marshall previously hadbeen co-manager of Goldman Sachs's financial strategiesgroup.                                                                                                          The Regulatory Examination                                                                                                          In late 1988 some members of the FHLBB-Topeka staff werehighly criticized for their handling of Silverado Savings andamp;Loan, a Colorado thrift, and were informed by Chairman M.Danny Wall that their jobs were in jeopardy if theirperformance did not improve. Some of these same individualswere later involved in the October 1989 Franklin examination.   The analyst in charge of Silverado, Thomas O'Rourke, wasassigned to work full time on the Franklin examination andmatters relating to Franklin beginning July 1, 1989.   Mr. O'Rourke noted that Franklin had in its portfoliosimilar assets to those formerly held by Silverado. Thissimilarity probably slanted Mr. O'Rourke's view againstFranklin and Franklin's system of operations.   Mr. O'Rourke reviewed and read Franklin's Form 10K (annualreport) for the period ended June 30, 1989. Mr. O'Rourke hadpreviously read only one form 10K and was unaware of thedisclosures required in such a document. O'Rourkemisperceived the cautionary disclosures of &quot;Material adverserisk&quot; in the form 10K as projections that the institutionwould experience difficulties. However, Franklin made thesedisclosures to fulfill its duty under federal securitieslaws. Such disclosures were included in earlier 10Ks filed byFranklin. After reviewing the Form 10K, Mr. O'Rourke drafteda memorandum changing Franklin's internal OTS {Office ofThrift Supervision} classification from &quot;healthy&quot; to&quot;marginal.&quot;   The disclosures presented in Franklin's 10K for the periodended June 30, 1989, were proper. The conclusions O'Rourkeand OTS reached after reviewing the 10K, that the risksdisclosed were likely or probable to occur, were arbitraryand capricious and without reasonable basis.   Members of the OTS-Topeka staff appeared to lack adequatetraining and understanding to evaluate the nature ofFranklin's operation. The written analyses and memorandaprepared by the Topeka staff, including portions ofFranklin's report of examination, Mr. O'Rourke's review ofFranklin's Form 10K, and the recommendation memo datedFebruary 12, 1989 contained fundamental factual errors aswell as material errors of interpretation and analysis.   The recommendation memo, or &quot;Smemo,&quot; went through severaldrafts before the final form was executed. The draftpreceding the final version was changed, on specific adviceand instruction of OTS-Topeka district counsel, BrianMcCormally. McCormally indicated that it was necessary to&quot;point the finger&quot; at Franklin's management. No factual orlegal basis exists for McCormally's instruction. This actionis indicative of arbitrary, capricious and unreasonableconduct.   February 15, 1990, Mr. Fleischer informed Thomas O'Rourkeof the conversation with IBJ Schroder, and that the bondtrustee was of the view that the Form 10Q did not constitutean event triggering default and also of the possibility of abond exchange. Mr. O'Rourke was instructed by OTS districtcounsel McCormally not to follow-up on this information.   At the February 16, 1990, board of directors meeting, OTSdistrict counsel Brian McCormally informed Franklin thatOTS's outside counsel had provided an opinion that the Form10Q as published and the report of examination constituted anevent of default allowing the bond trustee to beingcollateral substitution or legal defeasance. This waserroneous.   Following the OTS's February 20, 1990, directiveconcerning the hedge accounting and credit enhancementwrite-downs, Franklin nonetheless had the means to complywith all regulatory capital requirements through transactionsalready scheduled to occur.   On March 8, 1990, OTS was informed by facsimiletransmission that Franklin had available the means to meetregulatory capital requirements, even if the hedge accountingand credit enhancement write-downs were valid and that RTCwas preparing to announce publicly that Franklin was asolvent institution. On the following day, March 9, 1990, OTSimposed a second wave of adjustments consisting of anadditional $61.9 million (later corrected to $51.9 million)&quot;safety and soundness&quot; hedge accounting write-down and awrite-down of $110 million relating to the tax agreementsentered into between Franklin and FSC. The court finds thatthis second wave of adjustments imposed on March 9, 1990, wasarbitrary and capricious and lacked any reasonable basis.                                                                                                          OTS's Directed Write-downs for Deferred Hedging Losses                                                                                                          The hedge accounting issue in this case boils down towhether Franklin's policy and procedures for ascertaining theexistence of high correlation and substantial offset in pastperiods on an ongoing basis are appropriate implementation ofthe general guidelines of FAS 80, in accordance with GAAP.   Based on the evidence presented, this court is convincedand finds that the hedge accounting policies dated June 30,1988, and December 31, 1988, are consistent in all materialeffects and are in accordance with GAAP.   The expert opinion evidence presented in this case clearlyconvinces the court that the challenged provisions of theFranklin's correlation policy are safe and sound practices.OTS acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner and withoutreasonable basis in directing this second wave of write-downsrelating to the hedge accounting policy.   Franklin's hedging program has not caused any economiclosses to the institution.   There exists no relationship between the accounting gainson sales of assets and the amount of Franklin's deferredhedging losses. The court finds OTS's unsupported assertionsto the contrary to be without reasonable basis.   Franklin was not dependent on gains from the sales ofassets to conduct profitable operations. For each year fromJune 30, 1983, through December 31, 1989, Franklin had netincome after taxes, with gains and losses from sale of assetsand discontinued operations excluded.                                                                                                          OTS's Write-downs Regarding Bond Defeasance                                                                                                          OTS directed an additional $185 million reduction inFranklin's capital to account for the bond defeasance of the$2.9 million zero coupon bond issuance made in 1984. OTSconcluded that after the reductions were made for the otherwrite-downs, Franklin would fail to meet its core andtangible capital requirements. OTS considered that thisfailure of capital requirements would likely trigger the bonddefeasance/collateral substitution provision of the bondindenture. Bond defeasance or collateral substitution wouldresult in a realization of $185 million reduction inFranklin's capital. Therefore, OTS ordered this additionalwrite-down in capital.   The court believes that the OTS improperly relied on thebond issue in reaction to its failure to act promptly withrespect to similar zero coupon bonds issued by CenTrustSavings Bank of Miami, Florida. OTS wanted to avoidembarrassment, such as that caused by its failure to promptlyact and to prevent a loss on the CenTrust bonds. Franklin,however, was not in the same position as CenTrust with regardto zero coupon bonds. Franklin had never reported capitalfailure as had CenTrust. OTS's attempt to draw a parallelbetween Franklin's case and CenTrust's case was improper. AnOTS internal memo even indicates that the regulator knew thatFranklin was not in the same situation as CenTrust. (Exhibit827, &quot;Well, it ain't CenTrust, but it's all we got.&quot;) OTS'saction regarding the directed write-down for bond defeasancewas arbitrary and capricious and without reasonable basis inlaw or fact.                                                                                                          Charges of Biased or Prejudiced Action by OTS                                                                                                          Franklin has contended that OTS acted with improper biasand prejudice and in bad faith against Franklin. Although thecourt has found that the OTS lacked statutory grounds for theimposition of conservator and that the regulator madeerroneous findings and conclusions which lacked anyreasonable basis, the court finds that the regulator'sactions cannot be characterized as biased or prejudicedagainst Franklin or taken in bad faith. It is most likelythat OTS/Topeka was motivated by the disturbing events thathad occurred earlier with regard to Silverado Savings andLoan in Colorado and its difficulty with Franklin's uniqueand innovative operations. Nevertheless, the court finds thatFranklin has not shown that OTS was motivated in itsdecisions regarding the 1989 examination and the ultimateimposition of the conservator in February 1990 by bias orprejudice against Franklin or out of any type of bad faith.                                                                                                          Final Comment                                                                                                          The court's concern and review in this case is limited towhether the OTS acted properly in February 1990 in appointinga conservator for Franklin. The court realizes that Franklinis not the same institution today that it was as of February16, 1990, after six months of control by RTC. There couldvery well be some difficulty in Franklin's managementreacquiring control and operating Franklin today. That,however, is not the court's concern. The court was asked todetermine whether the regulator's action was valid andappropriate at the time it was taken. We have performed thistask in an expeditious and judicious manner.   The facts of this case clearly show that the regulatoracted wrongly in imposing the conservatorship. This courtmust correct that wrongful action. Any problems in thereacquisition of control by Franklin's management is a directresult of the OTS's wrongful conduct in February 1990.   It will now be the responsibility of Franklin'smanagement, and not the court, to effectively develop a planfor operating the association after six months ofconservatorship, during which they had no control.</TEXT></DOC>
