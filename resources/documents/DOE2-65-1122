In thelight of his instruction we remark upon key aspects of modelling forthe (a) fixed bed, (b) fluid bed and, (c) moving bed/transport line reactors.There emerges from such analysis a properly renewed awareness of theneed for a more sophisticated respect for reliable physical-chemicaldata. As Hanns has taught us, our models are no better than our data.</TEXT></DOC>
