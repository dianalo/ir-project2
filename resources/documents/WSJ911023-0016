Department officials said the federal Occupational Safetyand Health Administration will reclaim partial regulatoryauthority over North Carolina employers, in the wake of afire early last month that killed 25 poultry-plant workers inHamlet. Many of the employees at the Imperial Food Productsplant found outside doors locked.</LP><TEXT>   North Carolina Labor Commissioner John Brooks has beenlargely uncooperative with OSHA, refusing to voluntarily signa new operating agreement that would permit the federalagency to send in federal enforcement officers, departmentofficials said.   Instead, they said, Mr. Brooks has asked OSHA to lend hisoffice 24 compliance officers and industrial hygienists forthe state-run program. But they said they cannot legally dothat unless OSHA people in other regions volunteer for theNorth Carolina duty, and volunteers aren't available.   North Carolina is one of 25 states and U.S. territoriesthat regulate worker health and safety under OSHA-approvedplans. The AFL-CIO, saying that the state is &quot;grosslydelinquent&quot; in protecting workers, asked OSHA to reclaimregulatory authority over North Carolina employers.   Labor Secretary Lynn Martin began a review of all thestate-run job-safety plans the day after the Hamlet fire, herdepartment said. Last month, an OSHA spokesman said theagency will finish that review before completing anyfull-scale consideration of the AFL-CIO petition, but hedidn't rule out quicker action.</TEXT></DOC>
