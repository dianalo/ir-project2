China deniedthe charge.   Eleven apartments in a diplomatic compound were struck by bulletsJune 7, according to a U.S. Embassy report obtained by TheAssociated Press.   ``There is no doubt ... that certain apartments were deliberatelytargeted by the PLA (People's Liberation Army),'' said the report.   No one was injured in the compound. The report said two Americanchildren in one of the apartments were shielded by their Chinesenursemaids.   One apartment was hit with 18 bullets, and another was examinedand found to have been hit by several rounds fired from across thestreet, and not on the ground below as the Chinese have claimed,according to the report.   Embassy Charge d'Affaires Raymond Burghardt delivered a note ofprotest to the Chinese Foreign Ministry, but there was no immediateresponse, said embassy spokesman Sheridan Bell.   The government-run Xinhua News Agency said the allegations were alie and that the soldiers were firing in self-defense after snipersbegan firing at them from both sides of the street.   ``Under such circumstance, they certainly have the right to firein self-defense at the direction from where the snipers' shotscame,'' Xinhua said. It said one soldier died and two were wounded.   The attack came a day after the State Department announced thatChina's leading dissident, astrophysicist Fang Lizhi, had takenrefuge in the U.S. Embassy after the military crackdown onpro-democracy demonstrators. American diplomats would not link thatto the shooting.   The student-led pro-democracy movement was crushed June 3-4 whenthe army and police moved into central Beijing's Tiananmen Squareand drove out students and their supporters.   Chinese reports say about 300 people died in the violence,including many soldiers and police officers. Chinese witnesses andWestern intelligence reports say the death toll could be as high as3,000, mostly civilians.   More than 1,900 people have been reported arrested since then,and 27 people have been executed, but some of the student protestleaders have avoided capture.   A reporter from Taiwan, who said he interviewed one of the wantedstudents, was missing after reportedly being forced into a car earlyMonday by undercover police.   Huang Teh-pei, who works for the Taiwan Independence MorningPost, said he interviewed student leader Wang Dan, who is on anationwide wanted list, on Sunday.   Police would not confirm Huang was detained, but Antonio Jiang, areporter for Taiwan's Journalist Weekly, said he feared Huang andWang had been arrested.   Huang met Wang in Beijing on Sunday and was driving with him in acar when they noticed they were being followed, Jiang said. Huanggot out of the car and Wang was driven off by the car's driver, butthe driver has not been seen since, Jiang said.   He said Huang's room was searched early Monday and he was forcedinto a car with no license plates outside his hotel around noon.   Wang, 20, is among the most wanted people in China. A historymajor at Beijing University, he was among 21 students named inall-points bulletins as organizers of the seven-week democracyprotests.   Wang said he had been in hiding in southern China and recentlyreturned to Beijing, according to Jiang. It would have been highlyunusual for Wang to come to Beijing, where there is an intensepolice dragnet, unless he was desperate for help to leave thecountry.   While public reports of arrests have reduced to a trickle, theyare known to be continuing.   Two men in handcuffs were led across a street by soldiers Mondaynight, and residents report many people have been taken away,questioned and sometimes beaten before being released without beingcharged.   China protested Monday to the French government over a June 29incident in which demonstrators occupied part of the Chinese Embassyin Paris for more than two hours.   Chinese media said the French demonstrators forced their way intothe embassy's education section and hung banners ``attacking andvilifying China.'' French news reports said about 30 people tookpart in the protest. Neither they nor Xinhua said what the protestwas about.   A senior Foreign Ministry official told the French ambassadr inBeijing that China ``demanded the French government punish theculprits and take practical and effective measures to ensure that nosimilar incident would occur in future,'' Xinhua reported.   Premier Li Peng, who ordered martial law in Beijing on May 20,submitted a draft bill Monday prohibiting protests that ``impingeupon the interests of the state.''   It said no protests may oppose the leadership of the CommunistParty or socialist system, advocate the splitting of China, or takeplace near important facilities such as government or party offices,airports, train stations, state guesthouses or diplomatic missions.</TEXT></DOC>
