The quarterly survey, conducted in August, found 47% of the economists expect a recession in 1989 and 42% expect one to occur in 1990. The remaining 11% expect the next recession to arrive even later. Three months earlier, 57% of the economists were predicting a recession for 1989.    The economists' median forecast for 1989 economic growth is an inflation-adjusted 2.3%, the association said.    For this year, the median forecast is for 3.9% growth in the gross national product, the value of all goods and services produced, adjusted for inflation. That forecast underscores how confusing last October's stock market crash was to economists. Before the crash, the survey showed economists expected 3.4% growth in 1988. After the crash, they scaled back their forecast to 2.7%. Now they are even more optimistic than they were before the crash.    The business economists also expect an acceleration in inflation. The median forecast shows a 4.4% increase in the consumer price index this year and 5.1% next year.    The economists project a steady rise in both short-term and long-term interest rates through the middle of next year and falling interest rates after that. </TEXT></DOC>
