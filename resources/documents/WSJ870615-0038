MangunoStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 06/15/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> FREST </IN><DATELINE> SEOUL, South Korea  </DATELINE><TEXT>    South Korea's swellinganti-government movement reached a turning point during thepast five days of violent civil unrest, when for the firsttime in at least seven years, significant numbers ofmiddle-class Koreans openly displayed their anger at thegovernment.   The surprisingly strong show of anti-government sentiment by a broad range of Koreans has emboldened the opposition, giving new momentum to its &quot;democratization&quot; movement and its protest of President Chun Doo Hwan's shelving of long-sought constitutional and electoral changes.    More important, the open support from middle-class Koreans belies repeated claims by the government and the ruling Democratic Justice Party that the growing unrest in South Korea is the work of a small band of student and labor leftist radicals who lack popular support.    Over the weekend, the Democratic Justice Party and government officials grappled over whether to declare martial law to deal with the burgeoning unrest. But their main concern, some officials said, was the extent of the support for the anti-government movement.    The officials' immediate problem, however, was how to remove about 300 militant students who took refuge in the Myongdong Roman Catholic cathedral in downtown Seoul Wednesday during demonstrations.    Late yesterday, riot police encircling the cathedral suddenly withdrew, the Associated Press reported, and the students were told that they were free to go. Catholic church officials, who didn't want to be identified, said the government agreed to pull back the police, and priests were ready to escort the students back to their colleges. But student leaders said they wanted to continue their action against the government and demanded that police release all prisoners detained in the recent unrest.    Many government officials were more worried by a series of related incidents that some officials considered more significant than the church protest.    On Wednesday -- at exactly 6 p.m., four hours after the Democratic Justice Party nominated President Chun's hand-picked successor, Roh Tae Woo, as its candidatetens of thousands of middle-class Koreans expressed their anger.    In response to earlier appeals from the newly formed National Coalition for a Democratic Constitution, church bells tolled in protest throughout the nation. At the same time, thousands of Korean drivers sounded their car horns in a display of solidarity with protesters battling riot police in more than 20 Korean cities.    The next day, dozens of elderly and middle-aged Koreans brought food and supplies to the protesters at the cathedral.    And at lunchtime Friday, more than 1,500 secretaries, clerks and business executives left their offices and marched to the barricades around the cathedral to taunt riot police and cheer protesters.    The government and the main opposition party each has consistently said that it has the support of the ill-defined Korean middle class.    Democratic Justice Party Chairman Roh reiterated the party's claim to the middle class in a news conference Friday. &quot;While there are forces who attempt a revolution by destroying the established order through violent means,&quot; said Mr. Roh, &quot;there is also a vast majority of middle-class citizens who are turning their backs against these radicals, enjoy affluence and are busy planning their future.&quot;    But several worried government officials and Western diplomats said Mr. Roh's statement and the Chun government's long-standing position that the middle-class supports his administration had been undermined, if not fully disproven, by the week's developments.    The week's developments also shocked many diplomats. Some said they had miscalculated the middle class's latent hatred for the government and its support for the opposition.    &quot;The majority of middle-class Koreans are yet to be heard,&quot; said a North American diplomat. &quot;But the ones that were heard last week came through loud and clear, even if they did so from the safe distance of their cars and on the fringes of the demonstrations: They hate the government and were cheering for the demonstrators.&quot;    U.S. officials were cautious, but worried, about the direction the anti-government movement took last week. The State Department urged both sides to negotiate a political truce.    Meanwhile, government and Democratic Justice Party hard-liners -- agitating to impose martial law -- are at odds with moderates who urge restraint, said an aide to an official who attended the weekend meetings.    Chief among the officials' worries, the aide said, are how martial law would be received by the international community, and how it would affect President Chun's political timetable for electing his successor before the president's term expires in February. </TEXT></DOC>
