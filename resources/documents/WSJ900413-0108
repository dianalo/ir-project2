Everyone sharesin that happiness. But France's dealings with Libya to gainthis release raise questions. Let us quickly note that theFrench are not alone in having succumbed to the temptationsof over-sophisticated diplomacy. Some U.S. State Departmentofficials are so in love with their talks with the PLO theyare spinning in circles trying to turn a blind eye to recentPLO terrorist activities. But the French are playing adangerous game by engaging in subtle minuets with the likesof the Libyans, the Iranians, and the Iraqis. After theMirage shipments, a meeting with Yassir Arafat in Paris, afriendly visit to Tehran and an offer to Iraq to help rebuildthe nuclear reactor Israel blew up in 1981, France's allieshave a right to wonder what all this subtle flirting is meantto achieve. In France, the U.S. State Department, andelsewhere, process is running policy. Those who try to cuddlewith beasts often end up with their hands bitten off.</LP><TEXT/></DOC>
