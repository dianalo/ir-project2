The nose part and other parts of smallercurvature are heated to about 1,500{sup 0}C by the friction between airand the airframe. The minimum temperature in the airframe is -253{sup0}C in the liquid hydrogen tank and it is required for the constructionto resist this larger temperature difference and severe mechanical outsideload. For these reasons, the airframe side wall is constructed by thermalprotection system(PTS), main construction material and insulating material;and suitable materials and constructions must be selected to respectiveparts. In addition to using different heat resistant materials for PTS,an active mean to cool heated parts with a coolant can be thought. Thereare much technical accumulations in the USA, and there is large technologicalgap between Japan and the USA but Japan may display the power with advancedmaterials. (9 figs, 6 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
