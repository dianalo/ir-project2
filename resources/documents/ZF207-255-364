(products).andO;Product:   Type Manager (Printer software).andO;Topic:     FontsGraphics SoftwareIndustry Analysis.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Big things, so the old saying goes, often come in small packages.andP;  Thatsaying fits Adobe Type Manager perfectly.andM;The Adobe Type Manager is yet another piece of typographic systems softwarefrom Adobe.andP;  The Type Manager is that portion of the Adobe PostScriptlanguage that allows text appearing on computer displays to be scaled indifferent sizes by means of digitized outlines.andM;The Adobe Type Manager can either be incorporated into the systems softwareby computer vendors or installed directly by the user.andP;  With this softwaretool, users can scale fonts -- create type of any size -- right on theirscreens.andM;However simple that may sound, it is in fact a difficult task, made even moredifficult by the multiplicity of computer systems.andM;There is not enough space in this column to delve into the intricacies ofcomputerized typography or even to analyze the various methods for displayingand rendering fonts.andM;It is enough to know that as graphics become more prevalent, the leadingcomputer-systems vendors and vendor alliances -- Apple, DEC, IBM/Microsoft,Hewlett-Packard/Compugraphic, Sun/ ATandamp;T, and even NeXT -- are beginning topay real attention to fonts.andM;A Variety of SolutionsandM;Each computer-systems vendor has developed a proprietary solution forhandling fonts: These include the soon-to-be-announced extensions to Apple'sQuickDraw language, Sun's OpenFont technology, HP/Compugraphic's TypeDirector downloadable font utility, and Graphics Programming Interface (GPI)available in the IBM/Microsoft Presentation Manager environment.andM;The problem with all of these solutions is twofold.andM;First, these vendors have barely managed to make their systems compatiblewith available printers (that is, render on the printed page what appears onthe computer display), much less offer fonts compatible across users'heterogeneous environments.andM;Second, most are ignoring what is already the closest thing we have to asystems software standard for printing -- namely Adobe PostScript.andM;Some of them, such as Sun and Microsoft, are attempting to provide what iscalled Level Three compatibility with Adobe PostScript printer controllers(approximately one-fifth of the installed printer base provided by more than30 computer and printer manufacturers).andP;  The printing, however, will beslower and the quality not as high as Level One compatibility.andM;With Level One, the Adobe PostScript controller, which is generally locatedin the printer, completely handles font management.andM;The other alternative is to have a single imaging system (such as NeXT haswith Display PostScript), which Microsoft will have once GPI printers areavailable.andM;The Adobe Type Manager solves at least half of the compatibility problem:Adobe will license the type technology of the PostScript language to computerand systems software OEMs to provide type (font creation and management) thatis independent of the device.andP;  In other words, a true systems-softwarestandard provided by the only acceptable means -- a third-party, independentsoftware vendor.andM;One can only hope that IBM, DEC, Sun, Microsoft and HP will leap at theopportunity.andM;Apple hasn't, and so Adobe is providing the product through its retailtypeface packages.andM;Even if the Type Manager only solves the problem of compatibility fordisplays, all of us, not just Adobe, can emerge big winners.andP;  The type andprinter manufacturers don't have to worry about multiple formats, and thecomputer-systems vendors and users get compatibility across heterogeneousenvironments.andM;And Adobe?andP;  Well, Adobe gets one step closer to the world adopting DisplayPostScript and finally solving both the display and printer problem forever.andM;----------The Market Maker column is shared by Ruthann Quindlen and Andrew J.andP;  Neff.andO;Quindlen is a vice president at Alex.andP;  Brown andamp; Sons Inc.
