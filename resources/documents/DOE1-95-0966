<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-95-0966 </DOCNO><TEXT>The authors report on the onset of reverse bias diode leakage inducedby CVD selective tungsten deposition on (a) shallow n/sup +/(As)/p diodesmade by implantation into silicon and (b) n/sup +/(As or P)/p or p/sup+/(BF/sub 2/)/n diodes made by implantation into CoSi/sub 2/. Tungsten,nominally 1000A thick, was selectively deposited in a hot wall tubularreactor using either a one-step or a two-step deposition sequence at290{sup 0}C. The n/sup +/(As)/p junctions show an increase in leakagepopulation after tungsten deposition, as the junction depth decreases.The two-step process was found to produce greater leakage in shallown/sup +/(As)/p junctions than the one-step process. Arsenic implantedjunctions show severe degradation in the leakage distribution of shallowdiodes beneath CoSi/sub 2/. In contrast to arsenic, shallow junctionsmade by outdiffusion of phosphorus or boron implanted into CoSi/sub 2/do not show significant changes in leakage population after selectivetungsten deposition. Junction leakage measurements, and their temperaturedependence, is correlated with transmission electron micrographs.</TEXT></DOC>
