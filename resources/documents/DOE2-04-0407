The determination of total aluminum in naturalwater samples by furnace atomic absorption spectrometry is best performedwith a prior sample treatment with 1% HNO/sub 3/ + 2% H/sub 2/O/sub 2/or Acid Alizarin Violet N: detection limits of a few {mu}g/l are reliablyobtained. Ionic aluminum may be measured at levels down to 25 {mu}g/lby differential pulse polarography of the aluminum complex with AcidAlizarin Violet N; excesses of Fe/sup 3+/, Cl/sup -/, and EDTA interfere.9 refs., 3 figs., 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
