The study by the Northeast-Midwest Institute, issued ascongressional committees considered whether to recommend approvalof a free-trade treaty between the two countries, said theagreement broke new ground in easing trade barriers but failed toeliminate some long-standing trade problems.   If approved, the agreement ``probably will increase bilateraltrade, particularly between Canada and the Northeast-Midwestregion,'' the study said. ``However, the impact of the proposedagreement likely would be uneven, with some industries gaining andothers losing.   ``While the agreement would provide freer trade, its overallimpact on the balance of trade remains uncertain,'' said theinstitute, which is a nonpartisan research group established at thebehest of members of Congress to serve senators and representativesof 18 northeastern and midwestern states.   The U.S. automotive industry would suffer because the agreementwould retain through 1996 Canadian programs giving breaks on dutiesto third-country manufacturers.   That provision would enable Canadian parts suppliers to buildlong-term ties with foreign-owned auto manufacturers, and ``theprogram's distortive trade and investment effects would remain ineffect long after these duty remissions schemes were terminated,''the study said.   The treaty's requirement that at least half the content of anyauto crossing the border duty-free be North American is notstringent enough to prevent the purchase of engines, drive trainsand vehicle electronics from third countries, the study said.   The proposed 10-year phaseout of Canada's 9.2 percent tariff onautomotive goods would discriminate against U.S. makers whilegiving their Canadian counterparts duty-free access to U.S.markets, the study said.   Canadian tariffs on textiles, which range from 17.5 percent to25.5 percent, would remain higher than U.S. duties throughout a10-year phaseout period, ``maintaining a more restrictive barrierfor U.S. producers selling in the Canadian market,'' the study said.   The agreement would give Canadian textile makers a 56 millionyard quota for duty-free treatment of apparel made from importedfabric, double last year's shipments to the United States, whileU.S. manufacturers could ship only 11.5 million yards, the amountof last year's exports to Canada, the study said.   That lower level for the United States ``would limitopportunities for U.S. producers to penetrate the Canadianmarket,'' the study said.   The free-trade agreement, by eliminating over five years tariffson most industrial machinery produced for shipment to Canada, wouldallow exports of such products to become a leading growth sector inthe region, the report said.   Canada is the largest market for U.S. electronics exports.Immediate removal of tariffs on data processing equipment andtelephone sets and gradual elimination of tariffs ontelecommunications equipment would increase U.S. electronicsexports further, the study said.   Chemical processors, fertilizer manufacturers, food processors,metal casting plants and pulp, paper and lumber mills would gaingreater reliability in their supply of low-cost Canadianhydroelectric power and natural gas through provisions of theagreement preventing new quotas, taxes or price requirements, thestudy said.</TEXT></DOC>
