GalanteStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/14/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) </IN><TEXT>   RAYMOND PARKS is about to buy the Brigham's restaurant franchise in the Boston suburb of Hanover, Mass. Nothing unusual about that. But in doing so, Mr. Parks also will be acting as a financier, helping to support a leveraged buy-out of the restaurant chain.    Late last year, LeBow Industries Inc., a New York company, paid about $18 million for Boston-based Brigham's, which owns 72 restaurants and ice cream parlors in New England. Now, LeBow intends to sell most of the outlets to franchisees to raise approximately $10 million to help finance the acquisition.    Franchising, of course, already is a well-established method of rapidly expanding a business by relying on individual franchisees to finance the opening of a number of retail outlets. Now, it is gaining use as a way of financing a leveraged buy-out, an arrangement in which a group of investors acquire a company, primarily with debt. In the process, the joining of the franchising and LBO techniques has created unexpected opportunities for many people, such as Mr. Parks, to go into business for themselves.    DAYS INNS CORP. of Atlanta, for example, spun off 115 company-owned motels to franchisees after New York financier Saul P. Steinberg acquired the company for $300 million three years ago. (The sales produced more than $150 million in profit for Mr. Steinberg's Reliance Group Holdings Inc.) San Diego-based Foodmaker Inc., taken private in a $400 million LBO in 1985, is selling off many of the 700 company-owned Jack In The Box restaurants.    More franchise-related LBOs are in the works, says Patrick J. Boroian, president of Francorp Inc., a franchise consulting company in Olympia Fields, Ill. &quot;You are about to see a wave of acquisitions of company-owned operations that will be resold as franchises,&quot; Mr. Boroian predicts.    As financing techniques, LBOs and franchising have much in common. In an LBO, an investment group typically repays its debt with funds from the sale of assets or from the acquired company's operations. A franchiser also raises money from the sale of an asset -- the franchise -- and from royalties that franchisees pay annually. The purchase of an LBO-related franchise, however, also generally includes a payment for real estate, equipment and inventory.    MANY NEW FRANCHISEES are people like Mr. Parks, who, at age 60, previously had no thought of becoming a business owner. He was a little awed, in fact, when LeBow Industries offered to sell him a package deal: the Brigham's restaurant he managed in Hanover and an ice cream parlor in nearby Brockton.    &quot;At first, it kind of shook me up,&quot; Mr. Parks says. &quot;We're talking about more than half a million dollars. I don't have half a million dollars. I don't even have close to it.&quot;    But Mr. Parks did have a five-bedroom house that he bought in 1965 for $13,500 and that was recently appraised at $200,000. That, plus the history of cash flow from the two Brigham's outlets, persuaded a local bank to lend Mr. Parks the money to buy the businesses.    &quot;With these stores, I can pay off the loan in five or six years ,&quot; he says. &quot;And then all of it is mine.&quot;    The purchase of an existing retail outlet also has attractions for potential franchisees, such as John and Pranee Lin, who last March bought two Jack In The Box restaurants in Orange County, Calif., from Foodmaker. &quot;It's less of a financial gamble&quot; than opening a new franchise, Mr. Lin says. That also reassures lenders, he notes.    The Lins paid Foodmaker about $550,000, which covered the franchising fees and equipment for the two stores. They also pay Foodmaker a rental fee that can range up to 8.5% of gross sales, plus a 4% royalty and a 5% advertising fee.    While those fees may sound hefty, Mr. Lin says he and his wife are happy with their purchase. One reason: By managing the business more closely than their predecessors, who were Foodmaker employees rather than store owners, they have increased sales 22% over last year's level.    &quot;Nobody takes care of a business better than when they own it,&quot; Mr. Lin says.    ---   THE STOCK MARKET CRASH rattled owners of small business but not too severely, according to surveys taken by Seidman andamp; Seidman/BDO both before and after the debacle.    The market tumbled just as the accounting firm was about to release the results of a survey, taken in early fall, about the economic expectations of 250 owners of businesses with annual sales ranging from $2 million to $80 million. So, the firm went back and polled them again.    Before the crash, 80% were optimistic about the short-term outlook for the U.S. economy, but that fell to 60% after Oct. 19.    However, the percentage of business owners who were optimistic about the five-year outlook remained about the same: 74% before the crash and 76% afterward. And the percentage who expected their businesses to grow at a rate of 20% or better over the next five years actually increased, from 51% pre-crash to 61% post-crash. </TEXT></DOC>
