The California gray whales continued to swim several hundredfeet offshore Thursday near Point Barrow, using two holes in theice to breathe, said Geoff Carroll, a wildlife biologist for theNorth Slope Borough.   Carroll, who made an observation flight, estimated the holeswere about 15 by 30 feet, giving the whales barely enough room asthey rose to breathe every four minutes or so. Open water lay morethan four miles away.   Biologists believed time was running out for the grays asnighttime temperatures dropped to 13 degrees below zero,threatening to shrink the whales' breathing space.   ``They eat a lot and they have to keep moving,'' Carroll said.``I'm sure they're going to eat everything that's there before verylong.'' He said the whales eat plankton from the ocean floor.   The only answer would be an icebreaking ship to free the whales,Carroll said, but renewed efforts to contact an icebreaker thoughtto be in the area failed.   Biologists believe the whales were migrating from the BeaufortSea to their winter grounds off the Mexican coast when they weretrapped.   Several vessels, including a Coast Guard icebreaker, weredelayed by arctic ice this month and last.   Greenpeace's Anchorage office received several telephone callsasking if the organization could help the whales, said chapterdirector Cindy Lowry. Protecting whales is one of the group'sbest-known causes.   But Lowry said, ``There's not much we can do. We don't have aboat.''   The whales' presence in the Arctic Ocean this far into the fallis unusual, said Steve Swartz, a marine mammalogist for the Centerfor Environmental Education in Washington, D.C.   Swartz said he did not know of another incident in whichCalifornia gray whales have been icebound.   About two years ago, some 200 beluga whales trapped off theSiberian Coast were freed by an icebreaker, he said. A blue whale _the largest animal in the world _ occasionally gets caught in icenear Newfoundland, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
