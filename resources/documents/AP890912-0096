Residents of this border town filled a convention hall withbanners and balloons to welcome the immigrants.   ``This reception is really amazing,'' said Ute Kindl, a youngEast German woman. ``I'm really speechless over the warmness andkindness here.''   Resettlement camps were overflowing here today, one day afterHungary broke with East Germany, a Warsaw Pact ally, and allowedEast Germans to cross freely into the West.   Bavarian border police said they estimated the number ofimmigrants in West Germany at ``over 10,000.''   There were conflicting reports about how many East Germans hadcrossed into Hungary since Monday morning. Maj. Janos Hornyak of theHungarian border guards said 6,529 East Germans arrived between 6:30a.m. Monday and 9:30 a.m. today.   He said all but 1,181 entered from Czechoslovakia, which issandwiched between Hungary and East Germany, and the rest enteredfrom Romania.   In the Czechoslovak capital of Prague, witnesses said more thanhalf of the 400 East Germans holed up in the West German Embassytoday left the grounds today.   Several refugees said East Germany had promised not to punishthem if they returned home and would let them apply to emigrate tothe West. The refugees had camped out in hopes of being allowed toemigrate to West Germany like their countrymen in Hungary.   The remarkable path westward was cut by Hungary, which isembracing liberal political reforms and seeking closer economic anddiplomatic ties with Western nations.   East Germans have used Hungary's looser borders to flee to theWest for years. That stream turned into a steady flood in May, whenHungary removed many border fortications with Western neighborAustria, and turned into deluge on Sunday when thousands of EastGermans vacationing in Hungary were allowed to emigrate en masse.   The refugees, who came through three separate crossings, hadcompletely filled five temporary camps near the Austrian border inBavaria and officials were seeking more shelter in military barracks.   Chief federal government spokesman Hans Klein criticized EastGermany for its public condemnation of the unprecedented exodus.   ``It's not Ice Age verbiage, but rather Stone Age verbiage thatthey have reacted with,'' Klein told a news conference in Passaulate this morning.   Soviet Politburo hard-liner Yegor Ligachev arrived today in EastBerlin, Soviet and East German reports said. It was expected hewould discuss the refugee situation with officials.   Most of the refugees arrived in private cars and at least 100buses bringing them through Austria into the southern West Germanstate.   Michael Tietmann, director of the Tiefenbach refugee camp justoutside Passau, said many of the emigres who had cars arrived laterthan expected. ``A lot of them told me they had gone shopping inVienna and took in the sights before going on'' to West Germany,''he said.   About 60,000 East Germans were reported in Hungary on Sunday _most of them on vacation _ but an Interior Ministry official inBudapest said Monday that 26,000 of them had returned home.   East Germany's Communist government expressed anger at WestGermany and Hungary for arranging the exodus, but announced noimmediate retaliation.   East Germany's ADN news agency accused West Germany of ``luringaway and misleading citizens of our land'' through an ``unrestrainedslander campaign.'' It said Hungary had ``unilaterally suspended''agreements between the two countries regulating movement of peopleacross borders.   Many East Germans here expressed fears that their relatives backhome would face reprisals.   ``Our parents still don't know for sure what we have done,''remarked one young man who arrived with his wife from Leipzig. Thecouple asked not to be identified by name.   ``We just hope this won't hurt them. They (East German securityofficials) have a way of making life difficult for people whoserelatives have fled to the West,'' the man said.   It was not known how long the exodus of East Germans out ofHungary would last or be permitted. News reports said the EastGermans might restrict travel to Hungary in retaliation, but EastBerlin denied the reports.   Some of West Germany's 61.3 million citizens have expressedconcern about how their country can absorb an estimated 100,000 EastGermans likely to arrive this year, up from nearly 40,000 last yearand the largest number since 207,000 fled in 1961. About 400,000ethnic Germans from other Soviet bloc countries also are expected toarrive this year.   Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Monday said his countrymen expressingdiscontent were insensitive.   ``We have no right to resist the search for personal happiness ofour countrymen from East Germany,'' he said.   While West German unemployment is about 9 percent, not enoughyoung people are signing up for apprenticeship programs to work ascraftsmen, and most of the East German refugees are young craftsmen.   Klein, the government spokesman, said officials received 8,000job offers in Passau alone for the refugees.   Inside Passau's sprawling Niebelungen Halle civic center, theWest German Red Cross and other relief groups had set up tiered bunkbeds, kitchens, and consultation centers for other new emigres.   Hundreds of people gathered in front of the center to greet thearriving East Germans.   Hungary's action marks the first time a Warsaw Pact country hasaided a mass exodus of refugees from an allied Communist nation. Theexodus is the biggest since the Berlin Wall was built.   In Moscow, the Soviet news agency Tass condemned Western mediafor what it called a ``tendentious campaign'' to spur illegal EastGerman emigration.   In Washington, State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucherpraised Hungary for boldly opening its western border in defiance ofa Warsaw Pact ally.   The exodus came after weeks of talks between the two Germanysfailed. On Sunday night the Hungarian government formally announcedit would allow all East Germans to leave for West Germany.   Before this week, about 6,000 East Germans had already fled thissummer through Hungary.</TEXT></DOC>
