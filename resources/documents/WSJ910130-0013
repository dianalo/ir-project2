The decision to curtail the flow of infant formulaalso reflects increasing pressure from Nestle's independentinfant-formula audit commission, headed by former Sen. EdmundMuskie.</LP><TEXT>   Critics object to the practice of encouraging new mothersin poor countries to give up breast-feeding by distributingfree formula through hospitals. Outside hospitals, the watersupply and other conditions may not be sanitary and mothersmay not understand usage directions. Improper use of infantformula can lead to malnutrition, diarrhea andgastro-enteritis.   &quot;This one area -- the distribution of supply -- has been alingering concern in the infant-formula controversy -- and weare trying to take a leadership role in resolving thatconcern,&quot; Barbara Campbell, a Nestle spokeswoman, said. Underthe WHO's current guidelines, formula can be distributed onlyto children &quot;in need,&quot; but the interpretation of the code isup to hospital administrators.   Until now, Nestle has supplied formula to Third Worldhospitals on a request basis. But over the next several yearsthe company intends to &quot;work country by country&quot; to haltvirtually all such supplies and to help goverment healthofficials define the infants who are truly at risk if thefree formula is discontinued.   In part, Nestle made its decision to tighten up on itsmarketing practices in the wake of mounting demands by theindependent Nestle Infant Formula Audit Commission.   In 1989, the commission studied infant feeding practicesfor a six-month period in about 90 hospitals in Mexico anddiscovered that infant formula was available in every one.Said Sheldon Margan, one of the NIFAC members: &quot;We found whatwe have known for a very long time: Institutions can have asmuch formula as they want and in many cases it is given to100% of the children in developing countries.&quot;   For its part, Nestle says it provides &quot;very small&quot; amountsof free and low-cost formula and that sales of infant formulain developing countries accounted for less than 1% of its1990 sales of $46.3 billion Swiss francs ($36.52 billion).Industry analysts estimated that Nestle has over 40% of the$3 billion world-wide infant-formula market.   Yet, even some supporters of Nestle's latest initiativeexpress concern the move may ultimately do more to bolsterthe company's image than the health of Third World babies.&quot;If the governments and Nestle's competitors don't fall intoline {with the policy}, Nestle will back off,&quot; Mr. Margansaid. The professor of public health at the University ofCalifornia, Berkeley, explained that when Nestle stoppedgiving out free formula in Thailand in 1988, rivalinfant-formula makers simply jumped into the void.   The Nestle spokeswoman made little secret of the company'seagerness to make other competitors comply with its plan,stressing that studies have &quot;demonstrated clearly that if onemanufacturer withdraws supplies, that doesn't solve theproblem.&quot;   It isn't yet clear how Nestle's competitors will react. Aspokesman for Abbott Laboratories Inc., the largest U.S.infant-formula company, declined comment, saying he hadn'tseen the policy, which was released late yesterday.   In any event, some Nestle critics said the new policyfalls short of the company's 1984 agreement with theInternational Nestle Boycott Committee. In that agreement,Nestle said it would halt free supplies, regardless of theactions taken by other rivals.   Said Douglas Johnson, chairman of Action for CorporateAccountability, which launched a world-wide boycott againstNestle in late 1988: &quot;This is a step forward from where theyare and several steps back from where they promised to be.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
