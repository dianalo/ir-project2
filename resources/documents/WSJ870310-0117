Unfortunately, they often meet on a single plate.    We are talking about the worrisome matter of pastrami rice bowls. Or the growing problem of cheese sukiyaki. Or even, quel horreur, Daddy's Mexican Favorite No. 46: kielbasa with mustard, onions and refried beans.    Many of Southern California's thriving lunch counters and small restaurants are owned by an increasingly spicy melange of Thais, Koreans, Mexicans, Cubans, Greeks and other enterprising immigrant groups. In the main, the new arrivals are excellent cooks. But a hearty few, given to experiment, are beginning to crossbreed their national cuisines in ways that are, well, more exuberant than charming.    Or so it would appear in the case of Gurume Chicken, a house specialty at Gurume, a tiny, Japanese-run restaurant in West Los Angeles. The dish consists of Oriental-style chopped chicken and green beans in an Italian-style marinara sauce. It is served over spaghetti, with a delicately shredded Japanese cabbage salad, Texas toast, and Louisiana tabasco sauce -- all for $4.75.    Such cross-cultural concoctions are not without advocates. &quot;Let's face it, we're in the middle of the melting pot. Some of our best dishes are ethnic carom shots,&quot; maintains Merrill Shindler, restaurant critic for the Los Angeles Herald Examiner. Mr. Shindler points out that for several years some of L.A.'s trendiest restaurants, among them La Petite Chaya and Chinois, have been blending Oriental and western cuisines with expensive dishes like Peking duck with champagne vinegar sauce and poached oysters with curry.    For those with more modest budgets, Mr. Shindler recommends Casa India, a downtown lunch spot where it is possible to enjoy a combination plate that mixes a chile relleno and Gujarat-style alu chole (spicy chickpeas), with plenty of salsa and Indian bread or tortillas.    &quot;Mexican and Indian spices are very similar,&quot; explains Raksha Patel, a Kenya-born Indian who says she and her husband opened the restaurant last year because they &quot;just wanted to see&quot; if the two cuisines would work together.    Moreover, there are signs that mainstream America is warming to the idea of hybrid cuisines. Foodmaker Inc., San Diego-based parent to the Jack-in-the-Box restaurant chain, claims to have a solid success in its new &quot;Fajita Pita&quot; -- Mexican-style shredded beef stuffed into a Middle Eastern pocket bread.    Still, the fajita pita is but a pale reflection of L.A.'s multi-ethnic folk cuisine, which appears to have roots that reach back to the mid-1940s. That is when, according to one vague local legend, a Jewish man named Maury and his Mexican wife Mary served the first Kosher Style Burrito at an open-air lunch counter in the city's downtown business district.    The lunch counter, which has changed hands many times since, is currently owned by Jean and Kenny Han -- both Korean-born U.S. citizens. Miraculously, however, the burrito remains what it has always been: A layer of shredded pastrami, first smothered in chili sauce, dill-pickle chips and chopped onion, then gently wrapped in a warm flour tortilla.    &quot;We haven't changed anything,&quot; says Mrs. Han, an avowed culinary conservative who says that downtown businessmen and other customers consume about 250 kosher burritos daily.    But plenty of L.A.'s budding restaurateurs are showing less restraint. Don Taco, home of the pastrami rice bowl, now features a full line of Chinese burritos, while one of the Don's principal rivals, the Oki Dog, offers the Oki Dog, a chili-doused and tortilla-wrapped frankfurter.    Meanwhile, The Mad Greek, a local chain, has spruced up its chicken pita sandwich with American cheese and a dollop of Texas barbeque sauce. But it remains tame next to the Pita Feast's teriyaki chicken and falafel combo, or Meatty Meat's Polish egg chili cheese sandwich.    And speaking of combinations, what could match Cleopatra's dim sum-and-french fries lunch for $2.50 -- unless perhaps it is the neighboring Bistro Connection's &quot;Lasagne de France.&quot;    Still, even the best restaurants have found hybrid dishes a sometimes delicate matter. At 1000 Wilshire, a tony Italian restaurant in Santa Monica, Szechuan risotto disappeared from the menu for want of takers. &quot;I got the recipe from a chef who used to work here,&quot; says Thomas Wagstaff, the restaurant's general manager. &quot;He lasted three weeks.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
