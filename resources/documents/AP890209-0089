LaBELLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Israel today demanded the removal of a NorwegianU.N. commander who compared the expulsion of nearly 80 people fromIsraeli-controlled territory in south Lebanon to steps Nazis took inWorld War II.   Lt. Col. J.E. Karlsen, commander of the Norwegian battalion inthe U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon, or UNIFIL, made the comparisonlast week in a private meeting with Israeli officials.   He was protesting the expulsions of 79 Lebanese from the Israelisecurity zone, which he said were carried out by Israeli-backedChristian forces and Lebanese working for the Israeli Shin Betsecurity service. His remark was leaked to the press, and Israel'sForeign Ministry complained at the time.   However, the ministry now wants him removed because he was quotedby a newspaper as saying his comparison succeeded in drawingattention to the expulsions, a Ministry spokesman said on conditionof anonymity.   ``In light of the fact that the battalion commander is repeatedlyuttering his despicable opinions, Israel expects the UNIFIL commandto draw the proper conclusions regarding the officer,'' a ForeignMinistry statement said.   The dispute over Karlsen, 43, began Thursday when Israeli andU.N. officers met to discuss the expulsions.   ``In World War II, my fellow countrymen sacrificed their lives inthe struggle against the Nazis, who were trying to expel Jews fromNorway. Nowadays, you behave in south Lebanon exactly as the Nazisdid,'' newspapers later quoted him as saying at the meeting.   After Nazi forces invaded Norway in 1940, they expelled peoplefrom much of the north to create a military zone. They burned homesand other buildings.   Israel set up the 6-to-10-mile deep security zone north of itsborder in 1985 when it withdrew the bulk of its forces from Lebanon,ending a three-year occupation that followed Israel's 1982 invasion.   The zone is patrolled by Israeli soldiers and the South LebanonArmy, an Israeli-backed militia largely made up of LebaneseChristians. Most of the population of the area is Shiite Moslem.</TEXT></DOC>
