Commentsshould not be limited to the specific proposals set out in this notice,since all issues concerning FmHA's use of administrative offset are withinthe scope of this proceeding. The Agency's final rule may be differentfrom that set out in this proposal, depending on the comments receivedand on the Agency's internal deliberations.<ITAG tagnum="84">General Information </ITAG>The legislative history of the Debt Collection Act of 1982, 31 U.S.C. 3716,evidences public concern that Federal agencies were not taking sufficientaction to collect debts owed to them. The Act was designed to facilitatethe use of administrative offset, among other techniques, so as to permitagencies to remedy this problem. (See S. Rept. 97-378, 97th Cong. 1st Sess,1983 U.S. Code, Cong. andamp; Admin. News at p. 3377 <T3>et seq.</T3>) While the central purpose of the Act was to reduce the amount of uncollecteddebts to the Government, the Act also requires Federal agencies to establishdue process procedures for use in connection with administrative offsets.A situation frequently mentioned in the Congressional discussions on theAct was that of the unpaid student loan in which there had been no contractbetween the borrower and the Federal creditor agency for a period of severalyears. In this situation, notice and an opportunity to be heard beforethe agency took action would avoid surprise to the debtor, permit the debtorto raise any claims he or she might have of mistakes on the agency's part,such as the identity of the debtor and/or prior repayment of, or the amount,the debt. The General Accounting Office-Justice Department Federal ClaimsCollection Standards, 4 CFR 102.3, provide more detailed guidelines concerningthe procedures that agencies must establish and use in connection withadministrative offset. FmHA intends to use the administrative offset procedures that it will establishthrough this rulemaking proceeding to collect all debts that may be owedto it in the future_including debts whose circumstances fit the Congressionalmodel discussed above, and in which the debtor might have little reasonto anticipate the use of administrative offset apart from the notice issuedpursuant to these rules. The rules will be most frequently used, however,to recover losses on loan defaults on the Agency's farmer program and single-familyhousing loans. Because of the provisions of the Consolidated Farm and RuralDevelopment Act, the Housing Act of 1949, and the Agency's regulationsgoverning these programs, farmer and housing program borrowers will havereceived other notices concerning their overdue payments, and other noticesconcerning opportunities for debt servicing alternatives, before the Agencyuses administrative offset as a collection tool. Thus, much of the procedureset out in these proposed rules may appear to duplicate the process thathas already been given in connection with the indebtedness itself and hencelegally unnecessary. (The Joint Standards state that agencies need notprovide procedural rights in connection with administrative offset if thedebtor has been provided those rights pursuant to other statutory or regulatoryauthority. 4 CFR 102.3(b)(2)(ii).)Since these rules may also be used in situations other than defaults onfarmer program and housing program loans, however, and since establishingdifferent sets of rules to use in different circumstances would be administrativelycumbersome, the Agency proposes to establish procedures that will satisfythe requirements of the Debt Collection Act and the Joint Standards evenin situations in which the debtor has had no notice or process other thanthat set out in these proposed regulations. FmHA is not now using administrative offset to collect debts owed to it,and does not intend to do so until it establishes final rules at the conclusionof this proceeding. The rules presently set out in the Agency's regulations(7 CFR 1951.104-107) were established in late 1986 and 1987 (see 51 FR42820 <T3>et seq.</T3> (Nov. 26, 1986) and 52 FR 18543 <T3>et seq. </T3> (May 18, 1987)), and the Agency made some use of thoseregulations until December of 1987 to collect amounts owed to it. Use ofadministrative offset was less than it might otherwise have been becausethe Agency could not then accelerate most farmer program borrowers' accountsbecause of a then-pending injunction, which remained outstanding untilFebruary of 1989. On November 23, 1987, suit was filed in the United States District Courtin North Dakota (<T3>Moseank, et al. </T3>v. <T3> Lyng, et al.,</T3> Civil Action No. A1-87-196) complaining, amongother things, that the Agency's administrative offset procedures were notin compliance with the Debt Collection Act and other governing law. Plaintiffssought, among other things, to enjoin further use of the procedures. Sinceit seemed quite likely at that time that the use of administrative offsetwould have to be suspended in any event in the very near future becauseof the enactment of the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987, the Agency stipulated,on December 7, 1987, to refrain from using administrative offset in NorthDakota for six months. The Agency thereupon unilaterally extended thatpolicy to all other States by administrative directive. Both the stipulationand the directive were subsequently extended in effect up to and includingthe present time. Although the Agency's experience in using administrativeoffset is thus limited, FmHA has drawn two tentative conclusions from thatexperience that are reflected in changes to its existing rules set outin this proposal. The first of these is that the use of ``emergency'' offset_i.e., offsetwithout prior notice to the borrower_is unnecessary. While omitting priornotice is permitted by paragraph 102.3(b)(5) of the Joint Standards, thesystem of borrower servicing now established under the Consolidated Farmand Rural Development Act, pursuant to the amendments to that Act madeby the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987, should permit the identificationof instances in which administrative offset is warranted before an ``emergency''arises. Moreover, in situations in which the debtor has not had other recentnotice of the impending use of offset to collect a debt owed to the Agency,the proposed rules will provide better protection against mistaken useof the offset procedures. Thus the proposed rules would no longer permitthe use of administrative offset without prior notice to the borrower.Secondly, the Agency's experience has been that only a minority of borrowersrespond to a notice of intent to use administrative offset by requestingreview or other process. (The Agency's experience in this respect is apparentlyshared by other Federal agencies. See Administrative Conferences of theUnited States Recommendation 87-9, <T3>Dispute Procedures in Federal Agencies</T3>, 5 CFR 305.87-9, and thereport of consultant Martin B. White, <T3>Offset Procedures under the Debt Collection Act of 1982</T3>, underlyingthat recommendation. <T3>Administrative Conference of the United States, 1987 Recommendationsand Reports, Vol. II</T3>, pp. 939-997.) The proposed rule precludes theuse of notice, meetings, and other procedures to unduly postpone the useof offset when no colorable argument exists for so doing by allowing paymentsto be offset, subject to possible refund, during any administrative reviewof the decision. Therefore, the Agency tentatively concludes that includingthe opportunity for a face-to-face meeting with the decision maker as wellas a right to make a written presentation, even in situations in whichthe debtor has had other recent meetings on the same debt, will not inpractice create a substantial burden on decision-making officials. Thusthe proposed rules provide an opportunity for a meeting with the decisionmaker, plus the opportunity for an appeal of the process used to initiatethe administrative offset, in all cases.The proposed rules do, however, provide for combining the meeting on offsetwith any meeting on other debt servicing matters which otherwise wouldbe taking place. Neither the Act nor due process considerations seem topreclude the Agency from allowing the consideration of questions otherthan those pertaining to administrative offset. See, e.g., <T3>Housing Authority of King County </T3>v. <T3>Pierce</T3>, 701 F. Supp. 844, 850 (DC 1988).The Debt Collection Act provides that the debtor should be given an opportunityto pay the debt in full before administrative offset is used (31 U.S.C.3716(a)(4)). The Joint Standards also refer to this right, but subsection102.3(b)(2)(i), appears to limit it to situations in which the debtor hasestablished reasons why the use of offset would result in undue financialhardship or would be against equity and good conscience. The proposed regulationsimplement these instructions by giving a debtor the opportunity to makean offer to pay the debt within 30 days, and by including the possibilityof obtaining a written agreement to pay the indebtedness, for which securitymay be required, when the agency has determined not to use administrativeoffset because of extreme hardship on the debtor.FmHA is not entirely satisfied with this proposed treatment of this subject,as it applies to the use of offset to collect debts arising from defaultsin paying program loans, and is very interested in receiving suggestionsfrom the public on this point. This statutory provision was perhaps adoptedwith the long-overdue student loan (the situation mentioned in the legislativehistory and discussed above) in mind. In circumstances in which the debtmay be small in relation to the debtor's total income, and in which thedebtor may want to avoid suit as much as the agency, a written paymentplan may well resolve the matter. In the case of FmHA's program loans,however, the situation may often be extremely different_especially in thecase of FmHA's Farmer Program Loans. Before offset is used, the loan willhave been accelerated and the borrower already offered a number of formsof debt servicing, including writing down both the principal and interestof the debt to the point at which the borrower can ``cash flow''. Offsetwill be initiated only after these forms of debt relief have not worked.In this situation, it is highly unlikely that the borrow will be able tomake an offer to repay the entirety of the debt that any reasonable Agencyofficial could accept as credible. To hold out such an unreal possibilityof avoiding offset to borrowers who have already unsuccessfully attemptedto resolve their situation by using the Agency's more generous forms ofdebt relief_and who may be facing the loss of their farm and home throughforeclosure_seems pointless and unfortunate. FmHA solicits suggestionson how to better resolve this issue in its rules.The proposed additions to section 1900.51 of FmHA's rules governing administrativeappeals, and proposed subsection 1951.104(i), provide for limited reviewof decisions to use administrative offset by FmHA's National Appeals Staff.This appeals staff, reporting to the Administrator independently of Stateofficials, was established by FmHA in 1988 pursuant to the AgriculturalCredit Act of 1987, enacted January 6, 1988. While the statutory jurisdictionof the National Appeals Staff extends only to adverse decisions under theConsolidated Farm and Rural Development Act_i.e., to program loan decisions_anddoes not extend to decisions under other laws such as the Debt CollectionAct, the agency has tentatively concluded that allowing debtors the rightof appeal will assist in ensuring that administrative offsets are usedonly after the procedural protection proposed in these rules have beengiven. The review provided, however, is a limited one in that the hearingofficers will confined their review to questions of compliance with theregulations and related matters. Decisions that are within the discretionof decisional officers_the decision on whether to decline to use administrativeoffset because of extreme hardship, for example_will not be reversibleon appeal.Since program borrowers will have been given other notices and opportunitiesfor appeal on issues relating to the debt itself, the proposed appeal onadministrative offset would not deal with those matters again, except wherethe debtor was not a program borrower and thus had not had another opportunityfor administrative review of the agency's finding that a debt existed.See proposed andSection;1951.104(i). This distinction between the issuesto be considered on a appeal of an administrative offset and the issuesto be considered on the appeal of the agency's intention to acceleratea loan will become important in only a very few situations. Since the Agencyordinarily notifies a deliquent borrower of its intention to use administrativeoffset at the same time it advises the borrower that it intends to takeadverse action_e.g., acceleration_on the underlying loan, the borrowerwill be able to raise any issues concerning the offset along with any issuesconcerning the debt itself in one meeting with the decisional official,and one administrative appeal.In a more recent lawsuit on administrative offset quite similar to the<T3>Moseanko </T3>suit discussed earlier, entitled <T3>Fitzner, et al. </T3>v. <T3>Yeuter, </T3>et al., Case No. CV 6-89-240 (USDA, D, Minn.), filed onApril 18, 1989, several farm borrowers seek to enjoin FmHA from using administrativeoffset to collect delinquent debts. One issue raised by this complaintis whether payments made by sister USDA agencies such as the AgriculturalStabilization and Conservation Service should be exempt from taking byadministrative offset on the ground that taking such payments would, asthe Joint Standards provide, ``substantially interfere with or defeat thepurposes of the program authorizing the payments * * *.'' 4 CFR 102.3(a)(2).FmHA has tentatively concluded, and here proposes (see proposed subsection1951.103(e) to provide that payments that are like advance payments toa grantee or the payment of loan proceeds_e.g., the particular paymentfrom the Soil Conservation Service with which the recipient is intendedto cover the expenses of planting_would not be subject to offset, whilepayments representing rent would be so subject. It is FmHA's tentativeconclusion that it should issue guidance for its field offices on whichmajor Federal programs will be subject to offset, and the Agency solicitsthe views of interested members of the public on this idea, and on whatother kinds of payments should be specifically included in these rulesas being subject to, or not subject to, administrative offset. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Reviews </ITAG>This rule has been reviewed under USDA procedures established in DepartmentalRegulation 1512-1 which implements Executive Order 12291, and has beendetermined ``non-major.'' It will not result in an annual effect on theeconomy of $100 million or more; a major increase in costs or prices forconsumers, individual industries, Federal, State or local government agencies,or geographic regions, or significant adverse effects on competition, employment,investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-basedenterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or exportmarkets. This document has been reviewed in accordance with 7 CFR part 1940, subpartG, ``Environmental Program.'' FmHA has determined that this action doesnot constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the qualityof the human environment and, in accordance with the National EnvironmentalPolicy Act of 1969, Public Law 91-190, an Environmental Impact Statementis not required.

Increased Government borrowingcauses interest rates to rise and reduces the availability of credit inthe country.

Any money that is ormay become payable from the United States to an FmHA borrower or otherindividual or entity indebted to the Agency may be subject to offset forthe collection of a debt owed to FmHA. In addition, money may be collectedfrom the debtor's retirement payments for delinquent amounts owed to FmHAif the debtor is an employee or retiree of a Federal agency, the U.S. PostalService, the Postal Rate Commission, or a member of the U.S. Armed Forcesor the Reserve. Amounts collected will be processed as regular paymentsand credited to the borrower's account. FmHA will process requests by otherFederal agencies to offset amounts otherwise payable to FmHA in accordancewith section 1951.102 of this subpart.5. Sections 1951.102 through 1951.104 are added to subpart C to read asfollows:<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1951.102</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Standards and procedures for administrative offset against FmHA.</ITAG>(a) Requests made by other Federal agencies to FmHA to offset moneys tobe paid to FmHA debtors, including borrowers, contractors and grantees,must contain a written statement of the debt (including, where applicable,a separate statement of principal owed and overdue interest owed as ofa given date, and the amount of interest currently running) owed by thedebtor to the requesting agency, the due date of the debt, a descriptionof the basis for the debt, and a certification that all of the applicablerequirements of 31 U.S.C. 3716 and 4 CFR part 102 have been met. Requestsfor offset will be sent to the appropriate FmHA State Director.(b) Upon receipt of a request satisfying the requirements of paragraph(a) of this section, FmHA will effect an administrative offset from moneyspayable to the debtor, giving written notice to the debtor, unless theoffset might result in substantial interference with, or defeat the purposeof FmHA's program. For example, where the payment sought to be offset isa loan, offset will not be made since the debtor would not be able to usethe loan funds for the intended purpose. Similarly, where the payment soughtto be offset is an advance payment under a contract to purchase goods,FmHA will not make the requested offset because the debtor would in alllikelihood refuse to furnish the goods. However, where the payment is beingmade to compensate for past performance, the offset will be effected. Forexample, where the payment sought to be offset is for goods already furnished,the offset could be made without conflict with the purpose of the payment.(c) If FmHA determines not to effect an offset, a written statement, includingthe reasons for the refusal, will be sent to the requesting agency anda copy of that statement will be sent to the debtor.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1951.103</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Standards for FmHA-initiated administrative offset.</ITAG>(a) This section explains the procedures to be followed to use administrativeoffset to collect amounts owed by a debtor to FmHA from payments to bemade to the debtor by another Federal agency or from retirement paymentsto be made to a Federal or military retiree.(b) Before another Federal agency can be asked to offset any amount, thedebtor must have been given at least 30-days notice, on FmHA Form Letter1951-1, must have been afforded the rights set out in this section, and,if the debtor is an FmHA borrower, the borrower's account must have beenaccelerated. A delinquent amount does not have to be reduced to judgmentor be undisputed before offset can be used, and the payment does not haveto be covered by an FmHA security instrument.(c) Offset will not be used, if, according to State law, the receipt ofpayments after acceleration has the effect of reinstating the debtor'saccount. A State supplement will be issued explaining whether offset canbe used in each State. Sums received through the use of administrativeoffset are not considered ``payments'' as that term is used in 7 CFR 1955.15(d)(3)of subpart A of part 1955 of this chapter.(d) Administrative offset will be used only where it is feasible. Administrativeoffset is not feasible where, for example, the cost to the Government ofcollecting by offset will exceed the amount collectible.(e) Administrative offset will be used only where it is in the best interestsof the Government. It will not be used where it would substantially interferewith, or defeat, the purpose of the paying Agency's program. Examples ofthis situation are listed in andSection; 1951.103(b) of this subpart. Asanother example, FmHA will not offset the initial payment for plantingexpenses under the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) since an offset wouldpossibly result in the land not being planted for conservation purposes;conversely, it will offset subsequent CRP payment which represent rentalincome to the debtor. In general, income supplementation and enhancementprogram payments by ASCS will be subject to offset. The National Officewill provide guidance to FmHA County Supervisors as needed on the kindsof payments under other major Federal programs that will not be subjectto offset.(f) The use of administrative offset is limited when debtors have filedfor bankruptcy. Before administrative offset is sought for a debtor whois subject to a pending bankruptcy, guidance with respect to each particularcase will be sought from the Office of the General Counsel. Debts of debtorswhich have been discharged in bankruptcy will not be subject to offset.(g) FmHA will not use offset to collect a debt more than 10 years afterthe Government's right to collect the debt first accrued, unless factsmaterial to FmHA's right to collect were not known and could not reasonablyhave been known by the FmHA official(s) charged with the responsibilityof servicing the debtor's account until a time less than 6 years beforethe offset is initiated. Prior to collecting a claim by administrativeoffset after the 6 year period for bringing a civil action on the claimhas expired, the loan servicing official will obtain the concurrence ofthe Office of the General counsel to pursue the offset.(h) FmHA will not use administrative offset with respect to debts owedby any State or local government; nor with respect to debts arising underor payments made under the Social Security Act, the Internal Revenue Codeof 1954 (IRS) debts may be offset under the IRS offset procedure in andSection;andSection;1951.121 through 1951.127 of this subpart), or the tariff laws of the UnitedStates.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;1951.104</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Procedures for FmHA-initiated offset.</ITAG>(a) The use of administrative offset will be initiated by giving noticeto the debtor of the intention to use administrative offset. Such noticeshall advise the debtors of their rights to:(1) Inspect and copy their records;(2) Avoid offset by paying the debt in full within 30 days;(3) Present any reasons why administrative offset should not be used, includingthat the amount claimed to be owed is in error, that the use of administrativeoffset would create an extreme hardship, or that it would be unfair tothe borrower for some other reason;(4) Have a meeting with the decision-making officials, and(5) Obtain administrative appeal of the decision to use administrativeoffset.(b) The debtor will be given 7 calendar days after receipt of the noticeto ask to inspect and/or copy his or her records, and 15 calendar daysafter receipt of the notice in which to:(1) Make a written submission pursuant to paragraphs (a) (2) and (3) ofthis section, or(2) Request a meeting at which the borrower can make such a submissionand/or orally raise any matters relevant to the proposed use of administrativeoffset to collect the amount owed, or(3) Request immediate administrative appeal of the decision to use administrativeoffset.(c) When a debtor cannot, for a good reason, meet the time limits set outin this section, FmHA can, in its discretion, extend the time.(d) FmHA Form Letter 1951-1 will be used to give the notice required bythis section. Notice will be sent to the debtor, by certified mail, returnreceipt requested, at the debtor's last known address. A duplicate copywill be mailed to the debtor, on the same day, by ordinary mail. The dateof signing of the certified mail receipt will be used to compute the periodsfor response or, if the certified mail receipt is not signed and returned,the time frame will commence with the third day after the date on whichthe duplicate was sent.(e) If the debtor responds by asking for a meeting, it will be scheduledas set forth in 1900-B, and the debtor will be promptly advised in writingof the date, time, and place. If the response also asks to inspect and/orcopy records, the response will give the debtor an opportunity, within5 working days after the receipt of the request, to inspect and/or copythose records. The letter will explain where the records are and when thedebtor can inspect and/or copy them. The meeting will be scheduled notless than 3 working days after the date on which the debtor is allowedto inspect and/or copy his or her records. At the meeting the debtor willbe given an opportunity to present any evidence or arguments as to whyadministrative offset should not be used.(f) If the debtor asks to inspect and/or copy records, but does not askfor a meeting, the debtor should, at the time of record inspection and/orcopying, again be offered for meeting so that he or she will have an opportunityto discuss the contents of those records, or any other relevant matter,before FmHA actually begins to use administrative offset. This offer maybe made orally and will be documented in the debtor's case file.(g) Extreme hardship or unfairness to the debtor in using administrativeoffset are matters that are within the discretion of the FmHA County Supervisoror other decision-making officials. The reasons for decisions on claimsof extreme hardship or unfairness will be documented in the debtor's casefile. Substantial medical expenses, or the lack of funds (other than thoseto be offset) for essential family living expenses, especially when thedebtor's family includes dependent minor children, are examples of situationsin which a decision not to use administrative offset may be justified.In its discretion, FmHA may, as a condition to declining to use administrativeoffset because of extreme hardship or unfairness, require the debtor toenter into a written agreement concerning payment of the indebtedness andcan require adequate security for such agreement.(h) FmHA will respond promptly to all written or oral requests or presentationsmade by debtors under this section.
