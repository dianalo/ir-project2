The assessment provides a basisfor the conclusion that the field testing of these genetically engineeredtobacco plants does not present a risk of plant pest introduction or disseminationand also will not have any significant impact on the quality of the humanenvironment. Based upon this finding of no significant impact, the Animaland Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that an environmentalimpact statement need not be prepared.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Copies of the environmental assessment and finding ofno significant impact are available for public inspection at the Biotechnologyand Environemental Coordination Staff, Animal and Plant Health InspectionService, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Room 406, Federal Building, 6505Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Dr. Quentin B.

The rule regulates the introduction(importation, interstate movement, and release into the environment) ofgenetically engineered organisms and products which are plant pests orwhich there is reason to believe are plant pests (regulated articles).The rule sets forth procedures for obtaining a permit for the release intothe environment of a regulated article and for obtaining limited permitsfor the importation or interstate movement of a regulated article. A permitmust be obtained before a regulated article can be introduced in the UnitedStates.APHIS has stated that it would prepare environmental assessments and, wherenecessary, environmental impact statements prior to issuing a permit forthe release into the environment of a regulated article (see 52 FR 22906).The Agrigenetics Advanced Science Company of Madison, Wisconsin, (Agrigenetics)has submitted an application for a permit for release into the environmentof genetically engineered tobacco plants that are designed to be resistantto alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV). In the course of reviewing the permit application,APHIS assessed the impact to the environment of releasing the tobacco plantsunder the conditions described in the Agrigenetics application. APHIS concludedthat the field testing will not present a risk of plant pest introductionor dissemination and will also not have any significant impact on the qualityof the human environment.The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact whichare based on data submitted by Agrigenetics, as well as a review of otherrelevant literature, provide the public with documentation of APHIS' reviewand analysis of the environmental impacts associated with conducting thefield testing.The facts supporting APHIS' finding of no significant impact are summarizedbelow and are contained in the environmental assessment.1. A gene encoding the AMV coat (capsid) protein has been inserted intoa tobacco chromosome. In nature, the genetic material contained in a plantchromosome can only be transferred to another sexually compatible plantvia cross-pollination. In this field test, the inserted gene would notspread to any other plant by cross-pollination, because the flowering partsof each plant will be cut off.2. AMV is a plant pathogen; however, neither the AMV coat (capsid) proteingene itself, nor the derived gene product confer on tobacco any plant pathogeniccharacteristic.3 The plasmid vector used to transfer the AMV coat (capsid) protein geneinto a tobacco chromosome has been evaluated for its use in this experiment.The plasmid vector, although derived from an original wild-type Ti plasmidwith known plant pathogenic potential, has been disarmed; that is, phytohormonegenes which are necessary to confer plant pathogenic traits have been removedfrom the plasmid vector. The plasmid vector has been tested and shown tobe not pathogenic to any susceptible plant.4. The vector agent, the phytopathogenic bacterium that was used to deliverthe plasmid vector encoding the AMV coat (capsid) protein gene into a tobaccoplant cell, has been demonstrated by <T3>in virtro </T3>and <T3>in vivo </T3>assays to be eliminated and no longer associated withany transformed tobacco plant or seed.5. Horizontal movement by infectious transfer or transposition of any ofthe introduced genes or DNA sequences to another organism is not knownto be possible. The plasmid vector acts by delivering the gene to the tobaccogenome where it is stably inserted into the tobacco chromosomal DNA. Theplasmid vector cannot replicate independently of its vector agent and doesnot survive alone in any plant. No mechanism of horizontal movement isknown to exist in nature to move an inserted gene from a chromosome ofa transformed plant to any other organism.6. The size of the field test plot will be approximately 0.1 acre and willbe located on a private farm away from any major road or town.The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact has beenprepared in accordance with (1) the National Environmental Policy Act of1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321 <T3>et seq.</T3>); (2) Regulations of the Council on Environmental Qualityfor Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (Title 40, Code of FederalRegulations (CFR) Parts 1500-1508; (3) USDA Regulations Implementing NEPA(7 CFR Part 1b); and (4) APHIS Guidelines Implementing NEPA (44 FR 50381-50384and 44 fR 51272-51274).<ITAG tagnum="20">Done at Washington, DC, this 20th day of July 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Larry B.
