Mosbacher suspended the regulations on the turtle excluderdevices after shrimpers, angry about having to use devices theyclaim reduce their catch by as much as one-third, blockaded shippingchannels along the Texas Gulf Coast.   Under a court order to protect endagered sea turtles in aseparate lawsuit filed by the National Wildlife Federation,Mosbacher then ordered shrimpers who don't use devices to limittheir trawling times to 105 minutes.   The latest lawsuit, filed late Monday in U.S. District Court,seeks to force Mosbacher to resume enforcement of the suspendedregulations.   The principal known cause of death for the endangered or threatedsea turtles of breeding or sub-adult age is drowning in shrimp nets,the lawsuit said. The Commerce Department estimates more than 11,000sea turtles will drown annually in the nets of American shrimpfishermen who do not use the excluder device.   Comment on the lawsuit was not immediately available from theCommerce Department today.   ``Defendant's action in suspending the ... regulations andreplacing them with ineffective, inadequate interim regulations iscausing irreparable harm to plaintiffs and their members bydepriving them of the opportunity to study, observe, photograph andotherwise use and enjoy living sea turtles on their nesting beachesand in coastal waters,'' the suit said.   The five conservation groups say suspension of the regulationsand the limited trawls ``fail to provide for the effectiveconservation'' of five endangered species of sea turtles.   Mosbacher's actions were taken in ``disregared of the clearrequirements'' of several laws, including the Endangered Species Actand the National Environmental Policy Act, the lawsuit said.   Filing the lawsuit are the Environmental Defense Fund, NationalAudubon Society, Center for Marine Conservation, Greenpeace-U.S.A.,and Defenders of Wildlife.</TEXT></DOC>
