(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Bethlehem Steel Corp. said Friday itwill close its wire rope division in Williamsport, cutting 250 jobs,because the Federal Trade Commission would not grant early approvalfor selling the plant to a competitor.   ``We believe the planned transaction was entirely appropriate sothat timely clearance should have been granted,'' said Robert M.Funk, division president.   ``An authorization by the commission would have permitted anorderly transfer of the Williamsport plant to (Bridon American).This would have allowed Bridon to complete the purchase, to maintainmany local jobs and to minimize the impact on our customers and thearea's economy,'' Funk said in a statement.   The commission rejected an early termination of its investigationinto possible antitrust implications of the deal Bethlehem announcedin September. The federal agency has had the proposed sale underreview since November.   FTC spokeswoman Susan Tricknor declined comment.   Bridon American, located in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., is a division ofBridon andamp; Small PLC of Britain, the world's largest producer of wirerope and related products. It operates in Europe, Canada, PuertoRico and the Dominican Republic.   Bethlehem said it could wait no longer to close the deal becauseit was losing money at the plant and had no indication how long theFTC might study the proposed sale.   ``Williamsport has been losing money for a long time,'' saidcompany spokesman Gary Graham. ``We were down to the wire.''   Also, the Williamsport plant does not fit Bethlehem's long-rangeplan to concentrate on basic steel operations, the company said.   The plant employs about 250 hourly and salaried employees. Theworkforce has been reduced from about 500 people in early 1988.   Bethlehem said it plans to continue limited operations at theplant for about 60 days so that customers will not be inconvenienced.</TEXT></DOC>
