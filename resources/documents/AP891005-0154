The report raised doubts, however, about the accuracy ofmeasured concentrations of plutonium in the air surrounding the364-acre manufacturing complex near Denver. It said the airsamplers are out-of-date, prone to breakdowns and not properlylocated.   The 1{-inch-thick report, based on a six-week specialinvestigation by Energy Department experts, cited a series ofweaknesses in Rocky Flats programs aimed at identifying andcorrecting serious environmental problems at the plant.   Energy Secretary James D. Watkins ordered the special assessmentof conditions at Rocky Flats on June 6, the same day that dozens ofFBI agents and Environmental Protection Agency investigators raidedthe plant looking for evidence of illegal dumping and incinerationof hazardous wastes. A special grand jury was impaneled in Denveron Aug. 1 but has not yet issued any indictments.   Henson Moore, the deputy energy secretary, told a Senatecommittee Thursday the FBI has provided no information about itsinvestigation. He said it had promised to alert the department toany health-threatening conditions it might find.   At a separate congressional hearing, George B. Merrick, vicepresident Rockwell International Corp., which earlier this monthagreed to withdraw as manager of Rocky Flats, said his company alsohad been unable to get information on the FBI probe.   The separate Energy Department investigation was concluded July21.   ``No situations which pose an imminent threat to public healthor the environment were observed,'' the report said.   The highly technical documentation provided in the reportpainted a picture of deep-rooted problems in management of RockyFlats, including poor communication and planning, a lack of qualityassurance and the absence of a comprehensive strategy for bringingthe plant into compliance with state and federal environmental laws.   Among the investigators' findings:   _The plant's method of monitoring emissions into the open airfrom exhaust ducts are deficient. These flaws ``may adverselyaffect determination of radioactive materials released into theatmosphere,'' including plutonium, it said.   _No soil samples were taken after the release June 3 of a fluidcontaining the hazardous material Polychlorinated Biphenyl. PCBswere banned by the government in the 1970s after laboratory testsdetermined they caused cancer in animals, although the material isstill in widespread use in electric transformers.   _Bags of asbestos-containing materials are not covered with soilafter being dumped in landfills. Asbestos is a fibrous materialsuspected of causing lung disease.   _There are no formal procedures in place to minimize the risk ofspills and overflows during transfers of materials from undergroundstorage tanks. There also is no written procedure for requiringconstant monitoring of such transfers.   _Discharges from a cooling tower are allowed to form a pool ofstanding water in a courtyard between buildings. Eventually thiswater percolates into the ground, carrying with it any contaminantsthat could enter the groundwater.</TEXT></DOC>
