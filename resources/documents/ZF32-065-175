(Design Ideas) (tutorial)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Yiu, Henry.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>A design is presented for a differential amplifier that usescharge balancing to reduce differential voltages imposed on highcommon-mode voltages into a range that can be handled by theamplifier's integrated circuit (IC).andP;  Expensive precisionresistors and components required by other designs are avoided.andO;Diodes are used for charging when the clock is low, anddischarging when the clock is high.andP;  A low-leakage JFETinstrumentation amplifier measures the differential voltage.andP;  Theclock frequency is 100 KHz, if it is too high recovery time of thediodes becomes a factor, if the frequency is too low the circuitgain will drop below unity.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     CouplingAmplifiersCircuit designIntegrated circuits.andO;Feature:   illustrationchart.andO;Caption:   (Charge-balancing, capacitive voltage divider).
