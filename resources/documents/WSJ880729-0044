Growth is high and steady, unemployment is at a 14-year low, inflation seems under control, the trade deficit is falling and personal income is rising. So what is Michael Dukakis going to run on this fall?    The future of the economy. No kidding.    It's clear &quot;my message is economic,&quot; Gov. Dukakis said before last week's Democratic convention. And in Atlanta, those among us who choose to listen to convention speeches for a living heard Sen. Barbara Mikulski talk about &quot;working families,&quot; Rep. Bill Gray promise better housing, Sen. Bill Bradley hail children and child care, and so on. Mr. Dukakis then wrapped all of those up into an ode to a better America.    To Mr. Dukakis's strategists, this is more than the politics of hypochondria. It's a judgment rooted in what has become the conscience of modern politics, the poll numbers. The economy may be booming, but voters don't seem to believe it.    &quot;All the poll numbers show, I know mine do, that there's an uneasiness about the economy . . . about its underpinnings,&quot; says Tubby Harrison, Mr. Dukakis's pollster. In a fairly typical result, a late May ABC-Washington Post poll found that only 16% thought the economy was getting better, while 42% thought it was getting worse and 41% staying the same.    William Galston, a thoughtful Democrat at the Roosevelt Center for American Policy Studies here, says he couldn't explain this anxiety until he conducted voter &quot;focus groups&quot; in Illinois about six months ago. (If polls have replaced ideas in modern political science, focus groups now substitute for gut instincts.)    He found that for &quot;swing&quot; Democrats -- those who voted for Ronald Reagan but also for a Democratic senator -- the economy was still the dominant political issue. But instead of worrying about jobs or prices, they now fretted about &quot;the basics of middle-class life,&quot; especially big-ticket items such as housing and higher education. They felt that the middle class was being squeezed.    Out of this has emerged the Democratic emphasis on what Mr. Galston calls &quot;family economics&quot; -- on housing, child care, health care and education -- that was so evident in Atlanta. &quot;They're unaddressed needs,&quot; explains Mr. Harrison. &quot;How do you reconcile low inflation with the fact that you can't afford a house, that you can't send your kids to college, that you can't take care of your sick parents?&quot; So Mr. Dukakis won't ask, Are you better off than you were four years ago? Instead he'll assert, I will leave you better off four years from now.    Instead of Walter Mondale's carping about &quot;fairness,&quot; in other words, Gov. Dukakis will pledge economic opportunity for everyone, especially the middle class. He'll promise to address specific needs, without endorsing specific programs. He'll be an economic populist while dodging the label of &quot;special interests.&quot;    Mr. Bush's strategists are well aware of all this, not least because their own polling shows similar public anxiety about the economy. And to fight back, they'll punch both high and low. On the high road, Mr. Bush will talk about &quot;peace and prosperity,&quot; as he is now doing at every campaign stop.    As for the low side, the strategy can be summed up in the words &quot;Jimmy Carter.&quot; At the Republican convention next month, speaker after speaker will mention &quot;malaise,&quot; inflation, gasoline lines, and tax and spend; for good measure, they may also talk about the Massachusetts budget deficit.    A prototype of what to expect can be found in the three 30-second TV ads that the Republican National Committee began running nationwide this week. The ads imply how fragile prosperity can be. One of them -- titled &quot;I Remember You&quot; -- features images of shuttered gas stations, unemployment lines and headlines about inflation. &quot;You're seeing what America was like seven years ago,&quot; says the voice-over. &quot;The Republicans have worked very hard to make sure you never have to see it again.&quot; (Though the Bush campaign didn't pay for the ads, one Bush aide quips, &quot;Great minds think alike.&quot;)    &quot;They're trying to tie the economic question to the notion of change,&quot; says GOP strategist Eddie Mahe. &quot;What we must do is to force people to focus on the consequences of change, the risks of what the Democrats are advocating.&quot;    It would also help if Republicans campaigned as if they really believed their principles might help working Americans. Despite 68 months of growth, a little Democratic demogogy has most Republicans running to urge President Reagan not to veto a &quot;plant-closing&quot; bill; few are willing to campaign for &quot;plant openings.&quot; Mr. Bush's child-care proposal illustrates what might be done: His tax credit for child-care idea should help him with women voters, even as it marks a clear difference with a Democratic bill that would create a new bureaucracy.    Mr. Bush could also talk about the burden of taxation on families, and if he's really bold, recommend reducing the Social Security payroll tax that strikes low- and middle-income workers especially hard. (Though when I raised the latter idea with one Bush aide, he dismissed it out of hand.)    If he's looking for other ideas, there are Republicans who might have some. Sen. Ted Kennedy of all people actually stole a GOP line, in Atlanta, when he said Democrats &quot;are committed to the ideal that all of us can advance together -- and none shall be left behind.&quot; The man who has said that for years, who calls it his &quot;Good Shepherd line,&quot; is Jack Kemp. </TEXT></DOC>
