The government owns 90 percent of the open-pit mine, the largestin Mexico and 10th largest in the world. It sent 3,000 soldiers toclose the mine site, 25 miles south of the Arizona border, whenbankruptcy was declared last Sunday.   The action came one week before a strike scheduled by Cananeaminers to press their demands for a 330 percent wage-and-benefitincrease. Mine workers earn from $3,000 to $4,000 per year.   The government plans to sell its share of the company to privateinterests as part of a national strategy to trim federal investmentin Mexican business.   The National Action Party draws its strongest support fromnorthern Mexico and advocates privatization of government-ownedindustries. But, Ortiz said, ``We don't agree with the way they'redoing it.''   His party says the government should let the public know whatprivate investors are being considered in sales of government stock.In the case of prospective Cananea buyers, ``they haven't let thepublic know,'' Ortiz said.   National Action blamed both the government and the union for thebankruptcy.   ``The Mexican government is the principal responsible for the badadministration that sunk Cananea in the inefficiency'' that led tobankruptcy, it said in a news release.   ``Union bossism is also responsible for the blunders that enteredinto the unsustainable situation that has provoked the bankruptcy ofthe Cananea mining company.''   Since last year, two deals to sell off the government's share ofthe indebted company have fallen through.   Miners fought privatization and called the bankruptcy declarationa union-busting tactic. They blocked highways leading out of Cananeafor more than an hour on Wednesday in a protest march.   National Action on Thursday backed miners' demands for higherseverance pay.   Other opposition parties joined National Action in congressionalsessions Wednesday in demanding an investigation of Cananea'sadministration. But the Institutional Revolutionary Party majorityoverruled the proposition.   In elections last month, National Action's candidate won thefirst opposition party governorship in history in northern BajaCalifornia.</TEXT></DOC>
