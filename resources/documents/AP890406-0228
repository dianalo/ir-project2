The Joint Associations Working Group said importing workers isessential to avoiding an inflationary spiral and an erosion of HongKong's ability to compete with its Asian neigbors.   The group estimated Hong Kong needs about 50,000 importedworkers, most of them unskilled, to help fill what it estimatedwere 200,000 job vacancies.   The group's chairman, Martin Barrow, a senior executive atJardine Matheson Holdings Ltd., said there was a great danger thatHong Kong could ``lose its competitiveness in the manufacturingsector, the hotel industry and elsewhere'' because of the shortageof workers.   The Hong Kong government announced on Tuesday that it wasconsidering easing restrictions on the employment of foreignlaborers. Under existing policy, only foreign workers with skillsnot available locally are allowed to work in the colony.   Hong Kong's unemployment rate, currently running at 1.3 percent,is considered to be a key factor behind the economy's growthslowing to an expected 6 percent this year, less than half the 1987rate.   The labor shortage is due to the combination of a steady braindrain as the colony approaches its return to Chinese sovereignty in1997 and tight immigration laws.   While emphasizing that ``there are no viable alternatives toimporting workers,'' the report said the government should helpencourage automation and productivity through tax breaks andreducing red tape.   It said bringing in workers on six-month to two-year contracts,under a system similar to that practiced in Singapore, would be thebest way to provide relief. The group also suggested thepossibility of Hong Kong industry using workers that commute dailyfrom China.   The nine-member group included the Chinese General Chamber ofCommerce, the Federation of Hong Kong Industries, the Hong KongTourist Association and the Textile Council of Hong Kong.</TEXT></DOC>
