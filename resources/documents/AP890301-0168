The newspaper report also intensified East German pressure onNATO to match a flurry of disarmament initiatives launched by theWarsaw Pact.   East Germany's Deputy Defense Minister, Gen. Fritz Streletz, wasquoted by the Neues Deutschland newspaper as saying the eliminationof 600 tanks would begin in May.   Some will be scrapped while others will be converted to farm,construction and coal-carrying vehicles, the newspaper said.   Calling it a unilateral disarmament move, East Germany in Januaryannounced plans to reduce the number of its troops by 10,000 _ orabout 6 percent _ by the end of next year, and muster out six tankregiments as well as a fighter squadron.   Streletz said 80,000 troops were being discharged by EastGermany, Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia. He said morethan 2,700 tanks and 800 warplanes would be eliminated by ``thesesocialist brother countries.''   The Soviets have also announced they are pulling out about 50,000of their own troops from East bloc countries including East Germany.   The East bloc initiatives have put tremendous pressure on theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization to come up with its owndisarmament proposals to match those of the Warsaw Pact.   Streletz charged that NATO was ``continuing to hold onto itsaggressive concepts,'' Neues Deutschland reported.   ``We hope these (Warsaw Pact measures) provide a stimulus forother European countries to take their own steps toward decreasingtheir military potential,'' he was quoted as saying.</TEXT></DOC>
