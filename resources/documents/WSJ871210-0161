Gregorio &quot;Gringo&quot; Honasan.   Soldiers and police arrested Col. Honasan and four other military officers yesterday at a townhouse in an exclusive Manila suburb. The renegade didn't offer resistance, and there weren't any injuries or shots fired, according to Gen. Ramon Montano, who heads the National Capital Regional Defense Command. &quot;I'm really overjoyed by the capture,&quot; President Aquino said in a statement issued by her press secretary.    The arrest not only eliminates a threat from an enemy, but also gives Mrs. Aquino's government a psychological boost. Col. Honasan, 39 years old, eluded the military for more than three months after his coup attempt failed Aug. 28.    The military's failure to capture Col. Honasan, despite his many press interviews and several sightings in the Manila area, accentuated the public impression of a government not completely in control and a military whose loyalties are suspect. Col. Honasan often appeared to be taunting the government.    In addition to the rebel officers, officials also took into custody a man identified as the caretaker of the townhouse and a local reporter found at the house. Gen. Montano said the military questioned, but didn't retain, a foreign correspondent found in the vicinity. The presence of the reporters gave rise to speculation that Col. Honasan was giving another interview just before his capture.    The arrest came four days before Asian leaders are scheduled to begin arriving here amid tight security for a summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, whose members are Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines and Brunei.    &quot;Coming as it does on the eve of the Asean summit conference, the capture should reassure all peace-loving Filipinos that our country is headed for much better times,&quot; Mrs. Aquino said.    Fidel Ramos, the armed forces chief of staff, told a news conference after the arrest that the remnants of Col. Honasan's forces -- estimated at the time of the coup at more than 1,200 -- now comprise only 12 officers, 90 enlisted men and a handful of police. The rest have surrendered or been captured.    Gen. Ramos said Col. Honasan, who faces many charges of rebellion and murder, agreed to assist in convincing the remainder of his renegade group to surrender peacefully.    Gen. Ramos said the renegade's capture &quot;removes at least one large problem&quot; in preparing for summit security. But other ranking military sources said during the past week that two other right-wing rebel groups could pose a bigger danger.    A military source said the summit was a &quot;security nightmare.&quot; The problems were underlined Tuesday when a car bomb rocked Manila International Airport, injuring four, and a smaller bomb exploded in the city's Makati financial district, injuring no one.    No group claimed responsibility for the bombs. Another bomb was discovered unexploded yesterday morning in Makati.    Gen. Ramos said Col. Honasan denied responsibility for any terrorist action since their coup attempt, which left 53 dead and about 300 wounded. But Gen. Ramos refused to rule out the possibility of Col. Honasan's involvement in Manila-area bombings in the past two months.    For many years, Col. Honasan headed security for opposition senator and former Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile. The house where he was arrested belongs to a former employee of Mr. Enrile, according to neighbors. Mr. Enrile has denied complicity in the coup attempt. He couldn't be reached for comment on the arrest.    Col. Honasan was one of the leaders of the Reform the Armed Forces Movement, the group of young military officers that helped Mr. Enrile and Gen. Ramos overthrow Mr. Marcos in February 1986.    In statements after the August coup attempt, Col. Honasan said the attempted Putsch was made in frustration about lack of reform in both the military and the government since Mrs. Aquino assumed power. He charged that the Aquino government was soft on communism and cited such grievances as low pay in the military and continued government corruption. </TEXT></DOC>
