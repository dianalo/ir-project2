Microsoft, the biggest OTC software stock, climbed 1 3/4 to 56 1/2; Sun MicroSystems, one of the biggest OTC computer hardware issues, rose 7/8 to 35 3/4. The price of Lotus Development, a big software concern that unveiled a lower-cost software package yesterday, climbed 1 to 23 1/2.    Lotus was badly hurt during the recent sell-off of computer and technology issues, which coincided with its announcement of a delay in delivery of its new version of its 1-2-3 software. Its shares slipped 6 1/2 over the two weeks through yesterday.    It wasn't alone. The Nasdaq Industrial Index, which yesterday rose nearly 1% to 383.67, is still off 2.2% from 392.47 seven trading days ago. This index took the brunt of the sell-off, reflecting some dumping of the big computer issues by institutional investors reshaping portfolios for the end of the quarter, traders said. Some had apparently purchased the high-flying issues late in the quarter, and after taking some gains preferred not to reveal their late entry into these stocks to their investors in their quarter-end reports.    But today's big gains for some of the technology issues did little to erase steep losses chalked up over the last weeks or so by other stocks. Among computer hardware issues, 3Com Corp. dropped 1/8 to 19 1/2; two weeks ago it was at 23 5/8. Ramtek, a small maker of computer-graphics-display systems that was the hardest-hit issue on the National Market System in the sell-off, rose with the market yesterday 1/4 to 1 11/16. But the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company, which had to restate downward its earnings for the past two quarters, was still off 2 5/16, or 58%, from its week-ago price of 4.    Among software stocks particularly hurt in the past two weeks, System Software, which yesterday rose 1/2 to 14 1/2, has slipped from 16 1/2 two weeks ago; Syntech International, unchanged at 3 3/4 yesterday, is still down from 4 7/8; Information Resources, down 1/4 to 13 1/8 yesterday, has dropped in the past week from 14 5/8.    On the other hand, prices of bank and thrift stocks slipped a bit yesterday. The Nasdaq bank index, which measures primarily savings banks, edged down 0.18 point to 448.77.    As a result, the Nasdaq Composite Index slightly underperformed the Nasdaq Industrials, rising 2.86 points to 374.64. This index includes nearly 1,000 banks and thrifts, which make up more than one-third of Nasdaq's market capital.    Edward Macheski, partner in Macheski Asset Management in Wilton, Conn., says the banking issues remain &quot;good values,&quot; many having regained little since last October's crash. In addition, he notes, takeovers of many of these institutions continue.    Trading continued light yesterday with 124.5 million shares changing hands. Some 60 million rose in price, while 25 million fell. </TEXT></DOC>
