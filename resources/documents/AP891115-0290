The committee on Thursday is to consider a bill changing aprovision in the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act(RICO), which permits civil plaintiffs to recover triple damagesfrom white-collar criminals.   Public Citizen, a group founded by Nader, told a news conferencethat trade groups representing accountants, savings and loans,securities and commodities firms, banks and insurance companiesshowered the 14 members of the Senate panel with contributions from1983 to 1988.   Nader took particular aim at Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., whoaccepted $213,450 and is the sponsor of the reform bill.   DeConcini and four other senators have come under fire formeeting with savings and loan regulators on behalf of Phoenix,Ariz., millionaire Charles H. Keating Jr., a heavy contributor totheir campaigns.   Keating is chairman of the parent company of Lincoln Savings andLoan Association, of Irvine, Calif. The institution's failure isexpected to cost taxpayers up to $2 billion.   In an attempt to recover some of the loss, regulators have fileda $1.1 billion civil RICO suit against Keating and his associates.   ``Now the ringleader of the Keating Five, clearly the mostshamelessly shameless of all senators, Sen. DeConcini, ... wouldweaken the very law used by regulators and victims of corporatecrime against his friend Charles Keating,'' Nader said. ``This hasto be the acme of congressional presumption.''   DeConcini, in a statement, responded that he supported narrowingRICO because it has been misused to target legitimate businesses.His bill specifically permits bank regulators to seek tripledamages and would not benefit special interests, he said.   The senator said his original bill would have applied to pendinglawsuits, such as the one filed against Keating, but has beenchanged so that it affects only suits filed after the legislationpassed.   A coalition of business, labor and civil liberties groupsbacking RICO changes issued a statement saying it was ``appalledthat Public Citizen would personally attack'' DeConcini and labeledthe news conference ``a last ditch effort to stop a vote on RICOreform legislation.''   Ramona E. Jacobs, a Glendale, Calif., woman who lost $11,000 inthe Lincoln failure, complained at the news conference thatDeConcini, who conducted a hearing on his bill in June, would notallow her to testify on behalf of fraud victims.   Without triple damages in such civil suits, ``wrongdoers willquickly find out that crime _ particularly against defenselesscitizens _ pays,'' said Ms. Jacobs, who said her loss included aninsurance settement from an automobile accident that left herdaughter brain damaged.   Colorado Securities Commissioner Philip A. Feigin, speaking onbehalf of the North American Securities Administrators Association,said the DeConcini bill represents ``a concession of colossalproportions'' and ``the emasculation of the single most potentweapon against white-collar crime.''   According to Public Citizen, the other senators on the Judiciarypanel, in addition to DeConcini, and the contributions theyreceived from 1983 through 1988 from the targeted trade groups were:   Arlen Specter, R-Pa., $240,632; Charles Grassley, R-Iowa,$219,250; Howell Heflin, D-Ala., $157,400; Orrin Hatch, R-Utah,$128,600; Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., $117,903; Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.,$92,025; Strom Thurmond, R-S.C. and the ranking minority member,$89,075; Paul Simon, D-Ill., $74,500; Alan Simpson, R-Wyo.,$62,350; Joseph Biden, D-Del., the chairman of the committee,$36,750; Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, $19,500, and Herbert Kohl,D-Wis., who was elected for the first time last year, zero.</TEXT></DOC>
