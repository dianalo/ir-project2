The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Tuesday upheld a preliminaryinjunction issued by a federal district judge last June thatrevoked a permit and halted gillnet fishing for salmon by Japanesefleets in the Bering Sea off the coast of Alaska.   In a 2-1 decision, a three-judge panel rejected an appeal by theFederation of Japan Fisheries Cooperative Association to overturnthe preliminary injunction issued by U.S. District Judge NormaHolloway Johnson.   The injunction was obtained by an environmental group and anative Alaskan fisherman's organization to stop the accidentaltaking of sea lions, fur seals, white porpoises and killer whalesthat could be ensnared in the nine-mile-long gillnets.   As issued by the secretary of commerce, the three-year permitwould have allowed the Japanese fleet to accidentally catch 5,250Dall's porpoises in the northern Pacific Ocean _ including 789 inthe Bering Sea.   The court ruled that the permit, which allowed the Japanesefishing fleet to pay fines for the fur seals it accidentally took,violated the Marine Mammal Protection Act.</TEXT><HEAD>___</HEAD><HEAD>Justice Says Not Enough Give and Take in Court Deliberations</HEAD><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia saysthere isn't enough give and take at the private conferences thejustices hold to review appeals and vote on pending cases.   Scalia, the newest sitting justice, in an address at the GeorgeWashington University Law School, said calling what the justices doa ``conference'' is ``a misnomer.''   ``Not very much conferencing goes on,'' Scalia said. ``I don'tlike that. Maybe it's because I'm new or an ex-academic, maybebecause I am right.''   Scalia said the primary purposes of the conferences are toprovide an opportunity for the justices to state their views oncases and to tally up their votes.   The conferences are held weekly when the court is in session.Only the members of the court attend the closed-door meetings inwhich they decide whether to hear particular appeals and make finaldecisions on cases in which they have heard arguments.   Scalia became a justice in 1986 and will be joined by on thecourt by Anthony M. Kennedy, who will be sworn in Thursday as theninth member, filling a vacancy created when Justice Lewis F.Powell retired last June.</TEXT><HEAD>___</HEAD><HEAD>Court: Humane Society May Sue To Stop Hunting On Federal Preserves</HEAD><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal appeals court has ruled the HumaneSociety has legal standing to challenge the expansion of hunting onfederal wildlife preserves.   A three-judge panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Tuesdayoverturned a district judge's finding that the Humane Society ofthe United States lacked the requisite legal standing to sue theInterior Department to stop hunting on nine federal wildlifepreserves.   ``The gist of this grievance is that the existence of hunting onwildlife refuges forces society members to witness animal corpsesand environmental degradation, in addition to depleting the supplyof animals and birds that refuge visitors seek to view,'' the courtsaid in an opinion written by Chief Judge Patricia Wald.   David J. Hayes, a Washington attorney who represented the HumaneSociety, called the decision significant because ``it confirms thatenvironmental groups like the Humane Society have the right tobring actions based on their members' concerns about harms to theiraesthetic interests.''   While ruling the society had a legal right to sue, the courtupheld the Interior Department's decision to allow waterfowlhunting on Chincoteague Island, Va.   The appeals court decision sends a district court case back toDistrict Judge Thomas A. Flanneryfor a ruling on the merits of theHumane Society's claims that the Interior Department had notproperly evaluated the wildlife populations of other preservesbefore allowing hunting.</TEXT><HEAD>___</HEAD><HEAD>Weinberger Skeptical About Fundamental Kremlin Changes</HEAD><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinbergerquestions whether fundamental policy changes are taking place inthe Soviet Union and whether Mikhail Gorbachev can keep his post astop leader.   ``I think we have to be very careful if we assume there aremajor policy changes,'' Weinberger said. ``I don't know ... howfirmly seated is the present regime. I don't think any of us reallyknow that.''   ``I'm not sure anybody would be allowed to be general secretaryof the Communist party of the Soviet Union who is very different,''from the past, Weinberger told the Washington ForeignCorrespondents Association Tuesday.   Weinberger, who was succeeded by Defense Secetary Frank Carluccilate last year, described as ``surface changes,'' the new look atthe Kremlin. ``Gorbachev smiles from time to time, he wears muchbetter clothes, and he's younger and apparently in better health''than past leaders, he said.   ``The principal change I see in the Soviet Union is that theyare now actively courting world public opinion, campaigning for afavorable world press and this is so new and so novel that they aregetting it,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
