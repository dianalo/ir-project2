(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Atlantis' five astronauts onThursday successfully completed a test that simulated an enginestart and cut off moments before liftoff, NASA said.   The shuttle is scheduled for a secret military mission inmid-July.   NASA spokeswoman Lisa Malone said the two-day drill wentsmoothly. The countdown clock was stopped at four seconds beforethe mock liftoff.   On Monday, Atlantis was moved from the hangar to the launch padpreviously occupied by Columbia. Columbia was returned to thehangar last week for repair of a hydrogen leak that has delayed theshuttle's astronomy mission until at least mid-August.   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration plans toconduct a special tanking test on Wednesday, partly fillingAtlantis' external tank with super-cold liquid hydrogen to makesure there are no leaks. A similar test was performed on Columbia aweek after a hydrogen leak was detected during fueling for a May 30launch.   A launch date for Atlantis will be set at the conclusion of atwo-day flight readiness review on June 28 and 29.</TEXT></DOC>
