It reflects amendments to the 1986 edition of the DoD FAR Supplementmade by Defense Acquisition Circulars 86-1 through 86-5. Amendments madeby DACs 86-6 through 86-16 were published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> at 53 FR 38171, September 29, 1988, and willbe included in the October 1, 1988, revision of the CFR. <ITAG tagnum="84">B.

Public commentswere considered in the development of this final rule. DAC 88-6, Item XII Comments are invited. This interim rule is published prior to receipt ofcomments to implement the requirements of the Cargo Preference Act of 1904,10 U.S.C. 2631, which applies to the ocean transportation of cargo ownedby or destined for use by the Department of Defense.

Regulatory Flexibility Act </ITAG>DAC 88-6, Item I Public comments are not solicited with respect to this item. The RegulatoryFlexibility Act does not apply. DAC 88-6, Item II This rule is not expected to have significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory FlexibilityAct, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., because it will not diminish any existing preferencesfor small businesses, affect small purchase procedures, impose either specialskill requirements, administrative costs, or unusual business practicesupon small business. It is also required by a statute requiring uniformapplication. A Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has therefore not been performed.DAC 88-6, Items III, IV, V, VI, VIII, IX, and X These rules do not constitute a significant revision within the meaningof the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. The RegulatoryFlexibility Act does not apply. However, comments from small entities concerningthe affected DFARS Subpart will be considered in accordance with section610 of the Act. Such comments must be submitted separately and cite DARCase 89-610D in correspondence. DAC 88-6, Item VII This final rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial numberof small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act,5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., because most contracts are awarded to small entitieson a competitive basis, and the detailed cost or pricing data will seldom,if ever be required under this rule. DAC 88-6, Item XI This final rule will not have significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory FlexibilityAct, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., because 31 U.S.C. 9303 already allows a personto give a Government obligation as security. A proposed rule was publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on December 23, 1987 (52 FR 48549), and publiccomments were solicited. However, no public comments were received concerningthe Regulatory Flexibility Statement. DAC 88-6, Item XII This interim rule is not expected to have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the RegulatoryFlexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 601 et. seq., because this interim rulemerely implements the 1904 Cargo Preference Act, and the requirements imposedon small entities are necessary to ensure compliance with that Act. TheCargo Preference Act requires that ocean shipment of covered supplies beshipped on U.S.-flag vessels, regardless of the size of the contractingentity. A Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has therefore not been performed.Comments are invited from small businesses and other interested parties.<ITAG tagnum="84">D. Paperwork Reduction Act </ITAG>DAC 88-6, Items I, V, and IX The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply to these items because theyeither provide information or are editorial in nature. DAC 88-6, Items II, III, IV, VI, VII, VIII, X, and XI The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because these rules do not containinformation collection requirements which require the approval of OMB under44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. DAC 88-6, Item XII The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because this rule does not containinformation collection requirements which require the approval of OMB under44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. Under current industry practice, freight forwarders already prepare andmaintain copies of shipping documents, and the existing FAR Part 47 alreadyrequires contractors and subcontractors to provide notice of certain oceanshipments, in the form of copies of such shipping documents. The interimrule will expand this requirement to apply to more cargo, but the informationto be forwarded should not require additional recordkeeping on the partof the affected contractors. These requirements are imposed by the CargoPreference Act of 1904, 10 U.S.C. 2631. Federal agencies could not ensurecompliance with the law if this information were not collected.<ITAG tagnum="84">E. Determination To Issue an Interim Regulation</ITAG>DAC 88-6, Item XA determination has been made under the authority of the Secretary of Defensethat this coverage be issued as an interim rule. This action is necessaryto implement the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1988and 1989, Pub. L. 100-180, at section 222.DAC 88-6, Item XIIA determination has been made under the authority of the Secretary of Defensethat this coverage be issued as an interim rule. This action is necessaryto implement the requirements of the Cargo Preference Act of 1904, in lightof the February 2, 1988 Department of Justice opinion which concluded thatthe 1904 Act applies to supplies that are contracted for by the MilitaryDepartments that, at the time of shipment by sea are clearly identifiedas destined for military use, regardless of whether the Government hastitle at the time of shipment. These regulations are also necessary toestablish procedures which are consistent with the decision of the Courtof Appeals for the District of Columbia in <T3>Rainbow Navigation, Inc. v. Department of the Navy,</T3> 783 F.2d 1072(D.C. Cir. 1986).<ITAG tagnum="85">List of Subjects in 48 CFR Parts 203, 204, 208, 213, 215, 225, 228,247, and 252</ITAG>Government procurement.<ITAG tagnum="6">Charles W.

The following is a summary of the amendments and procedures.<ITAG tagnum="85">Item I_Safeguarding Conventional Arms, Ammunition, and Explosives(AAandamp;E) Within Industry (Information Item)</ITAG>Item II of DAC andplusmin;88-4 deleted the AAandamp;E coverage at DFARS Subpart223.71 and the related clause at 252.223-7003 because of the cancellationof DoDI 5220.30, ``Physical Security of Sensitive Conventional Arms, Ammunition,and Explosives (AAandamp;E) at Contractor Facilities'' (canceled December28, 1988). The DoDI has been replaced by DoD 5100.76-M ``Physical Securityof Sensitive Conventional AAandamp;E'', as modified through Change 4, December28, 1988, which is now the controlling document on AAandamp;E. Appendix Eof the DoD Manual provides physical security standards for DoD AAandamp;Eat contractors' facilities. The manual is available through the US Departmentof Commerce, National Technical Information Service, 5285 Port Royal Road,Springfield, Virginia 22161, telephone (703) 487-4650.<ITAG tagnum="84">Item II_Special Prohibition on Employment (Final Rule)</ITAG>Section 831 of the FY 1989 Department of Defense Authorization Act (Pub.L. 100-456) amended the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 2408(a) regarding employmentprohibitions on persons convicted of fraud or other defense contract relatedfelonies. The amendment added to existing prohibitions the additional prohibitionsthat defense contractors may not permit felons convicted of fraud or anyother felony arising out of contracts with the Department of Defense toserve as a consultant to any defense contractor or in any other way asdetermined by regulation prescribed by the Secretary of Defense. This ruleimplements this amendment and adds ``acting as an agent or representative''to the prescribed activities in order to make these prohibitions consistentwith those contained in FAR 9.405. In addition, section 831 increased theperiod of these employment prohibitions to a minimum of 5 years and permitswaiver only in the interest of national security. These amended prohibitionswere effective with enactment of Pub. L. 100-456 on September 29, 1988.A proposed rule with request for comments was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on December 9, 1988 (53 FR 49694). This finalrule revises existing DFARS coverage to reflect the above-referenced amendmentsand to provide for the waiver procedure. This rule is effective immediately.<ITAG tagnum="85">Item III_Instructions for Completion of DD Form 350, Individual ContractingAction Report (Over $25,000), and DD Form 1057, Monthly Contracting Summaryof Actions $25,000 or Less (Final Rule)</ITAG>Revisions are made to DFARS 204.6 to clarify and/or correct guidance forcompleting DD Form 350, Individual Contracting Action Report (Over $25,000),and DD Form 1057, Monthly Contracting Summary of Actions $25,000 or Less.Information concerning the Contractor Establishment Codes has been updatedto show the current contact points.<ITAG tagnum="84">Item IV_Contract Files (Final Rule)</ITAG>DFARS 204.804-4 is revised to incorporate a requirement for the issuanceof an Interim Contract Completion Statement (Notice of Physical Completion)by the office administering a contract, if other than the purchasing office.Issuance of this interim notice will assist purchasing offices in the timelycompletion of contract closeout actions. Other changes include substitutionof the term ``small purchase threshold'' in place of references to ``$10,000''in 204.804-5 and 204.804-70(a)(2), and deletion of the requirement forpurchasing offices to issue a MILSCAP Format Identifier PK9, Contract CompletionStatement, as cited in 204.804-5.<ITAG tagnum="84">Item V_Editorial Correction to DFARS 208.405</ITAG>DFARS 208.405-2(S-70) is revised to reflect the correct title which waschanged at the time the coverage was revised in DAC andplusmin;86-16.<ITAG tagnum="84">Item VI_Contingency Contracting Thresholds (Final Rule)</ITAG>DFARS 213.404(a)(3) is added to permit funds to be used up to $2,500 foreach overseas transaction in support of contingencies declared by the Secretaryof Defense.DFARS 213.505-3(b)(1)(ii) is added to allow warranted contracting officersto use Standard Form 44 up to $25,000 for overseas transactions in supportof contingencies declared by the Secretary of Defense.<ITAG tagnum="84">Item VII_Clarification of Adequate Price Competition (Final Rule)</ITAG>DFARS 215.6 and 215.8 are revised to clarify the existing coverage on AdequatePrice Competition. Clarification is needed to explain that adequate pricecompetition may exist even where price is not a primary factor in evaluationof proposals, regardless of the type of contract contemplated. A definitionof cost realism is included which is distinguished from the detailed costanalysis typically conducted in sole source procurements.The Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Procurement (DASD(P)) issueda memorandum dated May 1, 1987, on Adequate Price Competition. The memorandumexpressed concern that contracting officers were requesting detailed costor pricing data and then conducting detailed cost and profit analysis eventhough adequate price competition had resulted or was expected to resulton the procurement. The memorandum stated that there should rarely be aneed to obtain certified cost or pricing data in a competition althoughsome cost data may be required to determine cost realism to ensure thatthe offeror adequately understands the scope of the work. Unnecessarilyrequiring cost or pricing data is not in the best interest of DoD becauseit leads to increased proposal preparation costs, extends procurement leadtime, and wastes both contractor and Government resources. This final rule,effective May 22, 1989, implements the policy statement of the DASD(P)memorandum. A proposed rule with request for comments was published inthe <T4>Federal Register</T4> on March 31, 1988 (53 FR 10409).<ITAG tagnum="84">Item VIII_Certification of Cost or Pricing Data (Final Rule) </ITAG>DFARS 215.804-3 is revised to provide, for nonprofit educational institutionsand other nonprofit organzations, waiver of the requirement for certification,but not submission, of cost of pricing data for cost-reimbursement-no-feecontracts and subcontracts. This rule also completely exempts the CanadianCommercial Corporation and its subcontractors from submitting either costor pricing data or a certification of any such data.<ITAG tagnum="84">Item IX_Editorial Corrections to Part 225 </ITAG>(a) Section 225.001 ``Definitions'' is relocated to Section 225.101 tomake the coverage consistent with the FAR. (b) Paragraph 225.603(b)(3), <T3>``Customs Forms and Duty-Free Entry Certificates'',</T3> is redesignatedas paragraph (5) to reflect correct sequence of paragraphs. (c) Paragraph 225.603(b)(6), <T3>``Immediate Entry and Release'',</T3> is redesignated as paragraph(c) to conform to the FAR.<ITAG tagnum="85">Item X_Prohibition of Certain Contracts With Foreign Entities forthe Conduct of Strategic Defense Initiative Research, Development, Testor Evaluation (RDTE) (Interim Rule) </ITAG>Subpart 225.7013, Prohibition of Certain Contracts With Foreign Entitiesfor the Conduct of Strategic Defense Initiative RDTE, is added to implementthe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1988 and 1989,Pub. L. 100-180, at section 222. The coverage provides that Departmentof Defense funds may not be used for any contract with a foreign governmentor foreign firm for research, development, test or evaluation in connectionwith the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) Program unless the Secretaryof Defense certifies to Congress in writing at any time during such fiscalyear that work under the contract cannot be competently performed by aUnited States firm at a price equal to or less than the price at whichit would be performed by the foreign government or firm. The prohibitiondoes not apply to contracts awarded to a foreign government or firm if:(a) The contract is to be performed within the United States; (b) the contractis for research, development, test or evaluation in connection with antitacticalballistic missile systems; or (c) the foreign government or foreign firmagrees to share a substantial portion of the total cost. Further, the lawdoes not apply to contracts awarded before its enactment on December 14,1987, nor does it apply to subcontracts. A related clause is added at 252.225-7028.<ITAG tagnum="84">Item XI_Separate Bid Bonds for Constuction Contracts (Final Rule)</ITAG>DFARS 228.101 is revised and a clause at 252.228-7007 is added to requiresubmission of separate bid bonds vice separate bid guarantees for constructioncontracts. This coverage requires that DoD prime contractors furnish aseparate bid bond or certain other public debt obligations of the UnitedStates by the time set for opening of bids. A proposed rule with requestfor comments was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on December 23, 1987 (52 FR 48549).<ITAG tagnum="84">Item XII_Ocean Transportation by U.S.- Flag Vessels (Interim Rule)</ITAG>DFARS Subpart 247.5 has been revised in its entirety, the clause at 252.247-7200has been deleted, and a provision at 252.247-7202 and a clause at 252.247-7203have been added to implement the requirements of the Cargo Preference Actof 1904, 10 U.S.C. 2631, which applies to the ocean transportation of cargoowned by or destined for use by the Department of Defense. For such cargo,this constitutes an approved class deviation from FAR Subpart 47.5 in itsentirety, and from the clause at FAR 52.247-64.Contractors and contracting officers should note the new requirement fora solicitation provision, requiring offerors to state whether ocean transportationmay be required under the resultant contract or under any subcontracts.The cargo to which the U.S.-flag requirements apply is that which meetsthe new definition of ``supplies'' as defined in this coverage. The regulationno longer limits the application of the U.S.-flag requirements to suppliesthat are owned by the DoD at the time of ocean shipment. Under the revised procedures, contracting officers are required to forwarda copy of the first page of the applicable DD Form 350 to the U.S. MaritimeAdministration, when awarding a contract (other than a contract for directpurchase of ocean transportation services, or with a value below the smallpurchase threshold in FAR Part 13), which will require ocean transportationof supplies as defined in the subpart.The revisions included in this DAC shall be effective for solicitationsand resulting contracts issued on or after May 31, 1989. However, contractingofficers are authorized to apply the provisions of this interim regulationprior to that time in lieu of the existing DFARS Subpart 247.5 and theexisting clause at 252.247-7200, upon issuance of this DAC, if to do sowill not unnecessarily delay procurements. When applied, these revisionssupersede the deviation requiring the use of the clause at FAR 52.247-64with its appropriate Alternate, as directed in Deputy Assistant Secretaryof Defense Memorandum dated April 4, 1988.

(3) The freight charged by U.S.-flag carriers is considered excessive orotherwise unreasonable: the contracting officer shall forward a reportto the Commander, MSC through the head of the contracting activity andthe Director, Office of Contracts and Business Management, MSC. The reportshall take into consideration that the Cargo Preference Act of 1904 is,in part, a subsidy of the U.S.-flag commercial shipping industry whichstarts from the premise that lower prices can be obtained from foreign-flagshippers.

(i) The report shall be in Dandamp;F format and include, as appropriate,an analysis of whether the cost of the armed services is excessive, takinginto account factors such as the differential between freight charges bythe U.S.-flag carrier and an estimate of what foreign-flag carriers wouldcharge based upon a price analysis; a comparison of U.S.-flag rates chargedon comparable routes; efficiency of operation regardless of rate differential(i.e., suitability of the vessel for the required transportation in termsof cargo requirements/vessel capacity; the commercial reasonableness ofvessel positioning required, etc.); and any other relevant economic andfinancial considerations affecting the armed services. (ii) The fact that it would be less expensive to use a foreign-flag vesselis an insufficient basis, on its own, to determine that the freight rateproposed by the U.S.-flag carrier is excessive or otherwise unreasonable.However, such a differential may indicate a need for further review.
