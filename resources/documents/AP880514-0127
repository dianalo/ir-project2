He was 78.   Gorshkov, who was replaced in December 1985 by Vladimir N.Chernavin, died Friday following a ``severe and prolongedillness,'' Tass said. It did not specify the cause of death.   In his 29 years as naval commander, Gorshkov ``showed a talentof organization and deep knowledge of the naval science,'' Tasssaid, quoting an obituary signed by the Central Committee of theCommunist Party, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet and the SovietCouncil of Ministers.   ``Gorshkov had a feeling for the new and showed creativeapproaches in his work, and in a combat situation he displayedcourage, will and fortitude,'' it said.   It credited Gorshkov with making a ``big contribution to thedevelopment of the Soviet navy.''   A Western military attache said at the time of Gorshkov'sretirement that he had been ``an extraordinary naval officer of ourtime.''   The admiral was appointed to head the Soviet navy in 1956 byNikita S. Khrushchev, who considered Josef V. Stalin's emphasis onlarge surface vessels to be impractical because of theirvulnerability to rocket attacks.   In a book titled ``Sea Power of the State,'' Gorshkov said theSoviet navy's development of a fleet of submarines andmissile-launching warships had frustrated ``illusory hopes ofimperialist aggressors that in the sphere of armed conflict at seathey would have no strong opponent.''   He also argued that nuclear modernization was as important asthe initial acquisition of nuclear weapons to end the``unreachability of the American continent.''</TEXT></DOC>
