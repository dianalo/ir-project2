First you dedicate two or three years of your life to putting together a film. Along the way, you're lucky if you get even enough money to pay for the raw materials. And then, when you finish the film, no one wants to show it. Not movie theaters. Not TV networks. For most American TV viewers, &quot;documentary&quot; is a dirty word.    So it's a bold step that PBS takes tonight with its series &quot;P.O.V.&quot; (check local listings -- times vary). Over the next 10 weeks, public TV stations will offer a home to twelve quirky, subjective, independently made documentaries, films with -- as the title indicates -- a point of view.    These are not the straight-laced, buttoned-down documentaries of CBS or ABC, all polished and fact-filled and &quot;objective.&quot; These are messy, emotional films -- odd, vivid little slices of life, from a Brooklyn housing project to a Nicaraguan mountainside, from a survivalist camp to a porno bookstore, all collected by executive producer Marc Weiss.    &quot;P.O.V.&quot; kicks off tonight with &quot;American Tongues&quot; by Louis Alvarez and Andrew Kolker, and &quot;Acting Our Age&quot; by Michal Aviad. &quot;American Tongues,&quot; the 1988 Peabody Award winner, is a sly, whimsical look at the American melting pot -- the accents and dialects from Foat Wuth to Lou-ah-vull to Noo Yawk.    All across the country, an accent is what other folks have. &quot;I'm juss a plain ol' human bean,&quot; says a Kentuckian. &quot;I figger I saound jus' like Walter Cronkite,&quot; says an old fellah from Tangier, Va., in one of the most impenetrable accents you've ever heard.    &quot;Who do you think talks funny?&quot; is the film makers' arch question. All across the country, they get different answers: People from Wisconsin. Mississippi. Chicago. There's one classic exchange when a Southern woman wanders into Pastrami King and asks for hush puppies. &quot;Hush puppies?&quot; says the owner. &quot;Lady, this is a New York deli. If you want to nosh, you could schlep all over the world, you wouldn't find what we have here. How 'bout a poppy schmeer?&quot; The lady looks at him as if he's talking Chinese.    From that deli, Messrs. Alvarez and Kolker cut to the meat of the film -- how we classify people by accents: Anybody who talks like that is not one of us, not well brought up, not smart. Urban speech is seen as better than rural, white better than black, middle class better than working class. &quot;Every time I hear my brother talk,&quot; says one North Boston Italian American, &quot;I cringe.&quot;    &quot;Acting Our Age&quot; is a delicate film that speaks of women growing old gracefully. People have the impression, says director Michal Aviad, &quot;that when women get to a certain age, they stop living.&quot; Tracing the story of six women, aged 65-75, Ms. Aviad set out to show how their lives have not only continued, but flourished -- growing into acting, writing, community service.    &quot;My mother died an awful death,&quot; says one. &quot;She was in a home, where people sat around and did nothing. Bingo was the highlight for each week. It was a terrible thing that happened to her, and it won't happen to me.&quot; The women talk about what it means to be alone, celibate, living on $550 a month Social Security -- facing death and a society that has written them off.    In this &quot;P.O.V.&quot; series, many of the films aren't as good as they should be. Some are too slow, some are too long, many lack clear shape or structure.    But for each flaw, there is a redeeming value. &quot;Knocking on Armageddon's Door&quot; (July 19), a dark comic vision of America's survivalist movement, may meander aimlessly at times, but still it offers some chilling glimpses of a strange group of Americans that is preparing for the nuclear war it believes is just around the corner.    &quot;Rate It X&quot; (July 26), on American sexism, may be marred by basic film-making flaws -- sound glitches and focus foul-ups -- but its wonderful deadpan approach to blow-up sex dolls, &quot;specialty&quot; cakes and girlie magazines is packed with chuckles.    And when you get to the Academy Award-winning &quot;Best Boy&quot; (Sept. 6) -- about a 53-year-old retarded man preparing to leave his parents and move out on his own -- or &quot;Las Madres: The Mothers of Plaza de Mayo&quot; (Aug. 2), then the emotional power of &quot;P.O.V.&quot; is evident.    &quot;Las Madres&quot; -- the story of the mothers of the &quot;disappeared&quot; who stood up to the military dictatorship of Argentina and asked &quot;Where are our children?&quot; -- is especially gut-wrenching. When all of Argentina was cowed to silence by the junta, this band of older women, kerchiefs on their heads and pictures of their sons and daughters around their necks, took to the streets, crying and marching, their despair overcoming their fear.    These aren't stories that are pre-packaged to meet a format or an agenda. These are tales with wry flashes of humor, offbeat storytelling styles, and brutally gripping images. They are tales about people -- not sitcom people or dramedy people, but real people. Kudos to PBS (and the MacArthur, Harris, Benton and NEA Foundations) for providing them a home. Maybe some real people will be watching. </TEXT></DOC>
