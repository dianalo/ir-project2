Gorbachev said the governmentwill choose from among four plans for major economic reform andwill try to stabilize the faltering economy within six months.   And in an indication of the urgency he attaches to fixing thecountry's economic woes, Gorbachev said he would cut back onforeign travel.   The Soviet economy is wracked by shortages of everything frommedicine to cigarettes and citizens are furious. Politicians arepushing for economic reforms of varying speed and scope.   Four separate panels are currently working on widely differentproposals to move the Soviet economy from a centrally planned,command system to one driven primarily by market forces.   But speaking to reporters after a two-day session of governmentadvisory bodies, Gorbachev said officials believe the countryshould settle on one blueprint for major economic reform.   ``We must come out with one program,'' Gorbachev said. ``If welose two or three months ... it will affect things in such a waythat we will have to make corrections not only in tactics butstrategy.''   The commissions include a group supervised by Gorbachev andRussian federation president Boris N. Yeltsin, who favors fastermoves toward a market economy than Gorbachev and Kremlin leaders.   They went to work after the national legislature, the SupremeSoviet, rejected Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov's blueprint for atransition to a market economy.   The Supreme Soviet reconvenes Sept. 10 to take up the latestproposals, which Gorbachev said would not be ready for another week.   Yeltsin has said that if the central Soviet government's plan isnot to his liking he will implement radical and swift economicreform in Russia, the largest of the 15 Soviet republics. Thatwould be a major blow to unity of the Soviet Union, alreadyfractured by bitter ethnic and political clashes.   But Gorbachev said that at a joint meeting of the presidentialand federation councils this week, participants came to a ``generalunderstanding of the situation, its crucial nature and mostimportantly an understanding of the need to act together,cooperating.''   Gorbachev is scheduled to visit France in the fall but appearedto rule out another trip he had been expected to make, to Spain inorder to push along the nation's economic reform.   The Soviet president said serious measures would be taken in thenext six months to cut off Soviets' ability to accumulate ``hotmoney,'' the term for income derived from black marketeering andother activities.   The Soviet Union suffers from what economists call a ``rubleoverhang,'' a supply of rubles far outstripping the supply of goodsavailable for purchase.   Gorbachev did not say exactly how ``hot money'' would becontrolled and did not specify what other steps were underconsideration to stabilize the economy. He said the next stage ofeconomic reform would deal with prices, taxes, the government'sbudget and the earning, distribution and use of foreign currency.   Once the central government agrees on one of the reform plans,he said, it wil be presented to the legislatures of the Sovietrepublics. He acknowledged the proposals could face resistance.   ``Everything is subjected to doubt, to meticulous analysis,''Gorbachev said.   He said the national legislature would also review the economicreform plan and that afterward he would issue a presidential decreeconfirming it.   Ryzhkov's initial program, presented in May, called for drasticprice increases on bread and other items whose prices have remainedbasically unchanged for decades. The program fueled panic buyingthat made ill-stocked store shelves even barer.</TEXT></DOC>
