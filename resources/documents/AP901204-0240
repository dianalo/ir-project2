But analysts said the free fall may be bottoming out andsales should begin rebounding by spring.   ``Sales should be leveling off at this number in the fourthquarter and the first quarter of next year,'' assuming mortgagerates continue to fall and the Mideast problem is resolved, saideconomist David G. Seiders of the National Association of HomeBuilders.   Economist Mark Obrinsky of the Federal National MortgageAssociation suggested sales may zig-zag for several months, ``butassuming no blowup in the Middle East ... I expect to see a moresustained pickup by spring of 1991.''   Sales totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 491,000, theDepartments of Commerce and Housing and Urban Development said in ajoint release. That was the lowest since 480,000 new homes weresold in October 1982, a month before the 1981-82 recession ended.   So far this year, new home sales were off 15.8 percent from thesame period of 1989.   Sales fell 4 percent in September and 2 percent in August. TheSeptember figure was revised down from 6 percent in thedepartments' initial estimate, but the October total was worse thanthe 1.8 percent drop first reported.   Obrinsky said the main reason for the decline ``is greatconsumer uncertainty and generally negative buying sentiment.''   Consumers, he said, are experiencing rising prices caused by thePersian Gulf crisis and increasing unemployment as the economyslows.   ``But, really, the big one is the great uncertainty over theMideast ... concern over war breaking out,'' Obrinsky added.   At the October sales pace, it would take 8.4 months to exhaustthe inventory of unsold homes, up from 8.3 months in September.There was a seven-month supply of unsold homes in October 1989.   But Richard Peach, an economist with the Mortgage BankersAssociation, said builders are cutting back on housing starts tocounter the slow sales.   And, ``once the market recovers, you're going to find relativelyfew new homes,'' he said. That, in turn, will drive up prices whichhave been declining recently.   The median price of a new home in October was $121,800, up from$112,900 in September but down from $123,000 a year ago. The medianmeans half of the homes cost more, half less.   Seiders attributed the price increase to a hefty 47.4 percentgain in sales in the Northeast which has the highest housing costsin the nation. Sales there totaled an annual rate of 84,000 unitsafter falling 12.9 percent the previous month.   Sales in all other regions fell, including a drop of 18.2percent in the West, to 112,000 units. That was the lowest since106,000 homes were sold in September 1982.   In the Midwest, sales were off 11.7 percent, to 83,000 units -the lowest since 74,000 homes were sold in August 1986. Salesdropped 4.1 percent in the South, to 212,000 units.</TEXT></DOC>
