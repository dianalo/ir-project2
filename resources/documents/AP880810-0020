Jeffrey D. Denit of the Environmental Protection Agency saidTuesday that the agency has no plans to impose regulations formedical waste disposal, despite a chorus of congressional criticismand public complaints.   He told a House subcommittee that educational efforts willremain the administration's key to fighting the medical wasteproblem and federal regulations will be used only if those fail.   But the congressional Office of Technology Assessment saidcontinuing reports of hospital waste floating up on shores fromMassachusetts to North Carolina are graphic reminders of abeleaguered system that lacks federal standards.   ``No federal standards exist which comprehensively address thehandling, transportation, treatment and disposal of biomedicalwaste,'' said Kathryn D. Wagner, an analyst for OTA, the technicalresearch arm of Congress. She added that ``less than a handful (ofstates) have truly comprehensive regulations.''   OTA, in a preliminary assessment of the nation's biomedicalwaste problem, said the debris-ridden beaches are ``symptoms of adeeper problem of inconsistency, confusion and a lack ofcoordination both at and between every level of management.''   Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., chairman of the House Small Businesssubcommittee on regulation and business opportunities, called thehearing in the wake of a recent spate of beach closings.   Beaches in New Jersey and New York have been the hardest hit,but hospital debris also has been reported in Connecticut, RhodeIsland, Massachusetts, Maryland, North Carolina and on the LakeErie shore in Ohio.   ``This summer's medical waste problem is far more serious thanthe bloody syringes and vile specimens that have washed up,'' Wydensaid. ``These foul products are only the residue of a nationalwaste management system that is broken and overloaded.''   Wyden accused federal agencies of ``bungling'' the medical wasteproblem and attacked EPA for failing to set minimum standards forhandling, transporting and disposing of medical wastes under theResource Conservation and Recovery Act.   He also said the federal Centers for Disease Control have failedto recommend guidelines for waste handling and that theOccupational Safety and Health Administration has not acted toprotect health care workers from exposure to AIDS and hepatitis.   But Denit said EPA rejects mandatory regulations.   ``EPA's ongoing educational and technical assistance effortsshould be sufficient to resolve these issues,'' said Denit, deputydirector of the Office of Solid Waste. ``EPA will considerregulations only if education and guidance fail to improve currentmanagement practices.''   Denit added that studies indicate hospital waste is ``generallyless virulent than typical domestic waste.''   Nevertheless, Congress is considering a variety of measures totoughen penalties and create a system to track hospital waste.   The Senate voted 97-0 Tuesday to ban the dumping of sludge offthe New York-New Jersey coast after 1991. The measure included anamendment by Sen. Christopher J. Dodd, D-Conn., banning thedisposal of medical waste in oceans and streams and another by Sen.Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., providing a five-year prison sentence foranyone caught violating the ban.   OTA researchers plan to issue a report early next year on solidwaste issues, including medical waste. But in a preliminarybriefing given by Wagner to the subcommittee, the agency concluded:   _Lack of federal regulation has created a situation in whichstates, fearful that a neighboring state's more stringent law wouldbring added medical waste to their jurisdictions, are``leap-frogging one another to adopt the most stringentregulations.''   _Evidence exists that hospitals and other health-care employers,in an attempt to limit liability, are requiring workers to signforms stating they have been trained in handling infectiousmaterials after receiving only minimal training.   _The majority of biomedical waste is now incinerated on-site,but increasing state emission control regulations may lead morehospitals to hire waste haulers, creating the potential for moretransportation hazards and abuse by contractors trying to savemoney by dumping the waste in the ocean.   Rhode Island Attorney General James E. O'Neil showed thesubcommittee a respirator tube, a colostomy bag, a blood-encrustedneedle and other hospital waste that state officials have collectedin recent weeks from Rhode Island's shores.   Brooklyn District Attorney Elizabeth Holtzman called for strictfederal penalties and jail sentences for illegal dumpers and amanifest system to track the route of hospital throwaways.   ``Infectious waste is essentially a loaded gun and should belegally recognized as such,'' Holtzman said.</TEXT></DOC>
