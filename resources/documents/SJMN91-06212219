She said the company regularly lost money on the route -- a statementFort Bragg officials dispute.;    Greyhound first cut off service to the townin March 1990, raising objections from residents who said the buses provided acrucial transportation link to the Bay Area. Four months later, Greyhoundrestored the service.;    Residents on Monday greeted the new line as goodnews, Gleason said.;    &quot;People up here would just be happy with any kind oftransportation,&quot; she said. &quot;A lot of people were really worried about it. . ..
