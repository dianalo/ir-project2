Its strengthand resistance to heat made it ideal for many construction andinsulation uses.   It had a stength 10 times that of steel, yet could be woven likecotton into a fabric that resisted flames and acids. It was toughenough to brake a speeding locomotive and flexible enough to besprayed onto school building walls and ceilings for insulation.   During the first 80 years of this century more than 30 milliontons of asbestos found various uses in this country. Most wasimported from Canada.   But its widespread use began to decline in the 1970s afterpioneering research by Dr. Irving Selikoff of the Mt. Sinai Schoolof Medicine in new York made it clear that exposure to microscopic,breathable asbestos particles can cause lung cancer and other severeillnesses such as mesothelioma, an incurable cancer of the chest andabdominal membranes, and asbestosis, a chronic diseas of the lungsthat makes breathing progressively more difficult.   The word asbestos actually is a generic term for a variety ofminerals with tightly woven structures that provide unusual strengthand flexibility.   The most commonly used asbestos is chrysotile, a white magnesiumsilicate mined mainly in Quebec, Canada. Other commercial forms ofasbestos are crocidolite, a blue tinged compound, and amosite, whichis brown. Both are mined in South Africa.   Asbestos was used most extensively from the end of World War IIuntil the early 1970s.   In 1972, the Environmental Protection Agency listed asbestos as aharzardous air pollutant and in 1978 it restricted its uses, banningspray-on asbestos insulation.   In recent years asbestos use in the United States fell from240,000 metric tons in 1984 to 85,000 metric tons in 1987.</TEXT></DOC>
