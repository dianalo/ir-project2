ROSENBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Almost like generals shoring up the front lines,state legislatures are sending in fresh ammunition to aidcorporations battling hostile takeovers: new laws aimed athindering unwanted assaults.   Aided by recent key court rulings in favoring such legislation,the states increasingly have enacted new or toughened existinganti-takeover laws to protect companies facing real or potentialhostile buyouts.   ``Each new wave is getting tougher,'' Frederick Lipman, apartner with the law firm Blank, Rome, Comisky andamp; McCauley inPhiladelphia, said of the statutes.   That toughness has grown out of anger, Lipman said. Takeovershave cost the states thousands of jobs and millions of dollars inrevenue in cases where new owners closed plants and laid offworkers.   Some of the most aggressive laws have emerged in states wherelabor carries a lot of political clout, such as Pennsylvania andOhio. Laws in these states generally allow directors to considerthe welfare of employees and the community when the boards decidewhether to accept or reject a takeover bid.   The Ohio statute is broadest, allowing directors to alsoconsider a company's suppliers, creditors and customers, the localand national economy and social concerns.   ``What you're basically saying is you don't have to look to theshareholders' interest'' alone, Lipman said.   States have had anti-takeover laws for years. But since April1987, aided by a landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling, thelegislatures have become more assertive in acting to protect localcompanies.   The nation's highest court on April 21, 1987 upheld an Indianaanti-takeover statute and the right of the states to enact laws toprotect their corporations from hostile suitors.   Analysts then correctly predicted there would be an explosion ofstate anti-takeover statutes. Since the Supreme Court announced itsdecision, more than half the states have passed new laws regulatingtakeovers.   But experts say growing public sentiment against takeovers hasgiven the latest statutes their muscle.   Linda Quinn, director of the Division of Corporate Finance forthe Securities and Exchange Commission, said in a recent summary ofstate anti-takeover law developments that Delaware's new statute _copied with some modifications by other states _ may be the mostsignificant of the new laws.   The Delaware statute enacted last year generally restricts thecompletion of a merger for three years if there is no boardapproval and if the hostile takeover is not approved by 85 percentof the shareholders. If an acquirer cannot complete the merger, itmeans company assets cannot be sold to help finance the deal.   Many U.S. corporations, including more than half the Fortune 500companies, are incorporated in Delaware. More significantly,Polaroid Corp. proved earlier this year that the state's law works.   Polaroid used it as the basis for a successful defense againstan unwanted bid from Shamrock Holdings Inc. The instant-photographycompany placed enough stock in friendly hands to virtuallyguarantee that Shamrock would be unable to immediately complete amerger.   Polaroid's deft use of the law has given other states food forthought _ but analysts say anti-takeover laws are not a panacea.   ``I don't think any of these laws are going to automaticallyprevent takeovers,'' said attorney Lipman. ``They're just one moreweapon in the arsenal of management.''   Donald Margotta, a professor at Northeastern University inBoston, said many of the tougher laws have been on the books for ayear or more and generally have not deterred prospective acquirers.   ``They might require that people change some of their financingtechniques or their strategies subsequent to taking control of acompanies,'' Margotta said. ``We might see companies running theirtargets as subsidiaries rather than doing a merger.''   Some of the new laws also include provisions that seek tocurtail the growth of leveraged buyouts, transactions accomplishedprimarily through the use of borrowed money.   Such deals have come under attack by politicians and othersfollowing the record $24.53 billion leveraged buyout of RJR NabiscoInc., on the grounds that such heavy debt loads are bad forbusinesses and the economy.   One of the new statutes, part of New York's Business CorporationLaw, restricts an acquirer's ability to use of a target company'stax losses. It also limits in highly-leveraged transactions theacquirer's ability to deduct the resulting interest expenses. Thelaw covers state taxes only, but is an idea that Congress iscontemplating for the federal tax code.   Evan Weiss, counsel to New York governor Mario Cuomo, saidofficials are concerned about the impact that heavy borrowing mayhave on a company's business. They claim it discourages long-termresearch and development spending and job expansion.   Weiss said that even if a company is not under direct attack,``everybody's leveraging themselves to death to make themselvesunattractive to raiders.''   Margotta said laws like the New York statute make it moredifficult to do a typical highly-leveraged deal.   However, some of the strengthened laws are themselves vulnerableto attack.   Bank of New York Co. successfully challenged New York law'sshareholder rights, or ``poison pill'' statute, last year in itshostile attempt to acquire Irving Trust Co., which it eventuallywon.   The New York legislature has since approved a replacement forthe law.   Delaware's takeover statute was upheld by a U.S. District Courtin December _ which could make the law even more attractive toother states. But laws like the Ohio and Pennsylvania statutes thatempower directors to consider non-shareholder interests have notyet been tested in court.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for May 15 and Thereafter</NOTE></DOC>
