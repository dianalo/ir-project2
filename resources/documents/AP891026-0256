Citizens for Tax Justice, a labor-financed researchorganization, said the average tax rate paid by the nation's 250biggest moneymaking companies rose last year to 26.5 percent,compared with 14.3 percent in 1981 through 1985. Forty-fivecorporations still paid less than 10 percent of their profits inincome taxes, fewer than half the number reported a year earlier.   The study found the new law is shifting a greater share of thetax burden to corporations, as it was intended to do. Corporatetaxes paid 12 percent of the non-Social Security federal budgetlast year, up from 8 percent in the first half of the 1980s, thereport stated.   ``Tax reform is working,'' Robert S. McIntyre, executivedirector of Citizens for Tax Justice, said in releasing theorganization's fifth annual report on corporate taxes. ``Businessinvestment has boomed since tax reform, as money that used to gointo wasteful tax shelters has returned to the productive economy.''   McIntyre's past reports, which found that as many as 70 of the250 profitmaking giants paid no income tax in one or more years,were credited with helping to goad Congress into overhauling thetax law.   However, because the studies are based on the organization'sinterpretation of corporate report, they often are disputed by someof the companies cited.   For example, the new report listed Santa Fe Southern Pacific asone of the seven profitable companies that paid no tax in 1988. Thereport said the company had profits of almost $180 million,received a $2.1 million refund of past taxes paid, and thus had anegative tax rate of 1.2 percent.   ``We had a net loss in 1988 of $46.5 million as a result of acharge of about $627 million relating to divestiture of SouthernPacific Railroad, which we were required to do by the InterstateCommerce Commission,'' said Bob Gehrt, a Santa Fe vice president inChicago.   The new tax law enacted in 1986 repealed the investment taxcredit; sharply curtailed an accounting method that allowed largecontractors to defer taxes until a project was completed;eliminated the tax preference for capital gains and tightened the``minimum tax,'' a special levy aimed at profitmaking businessesthat use large writeoffs to avoid all or most of their taxliability.   The report said that, in addition to Santa Fe Southern, fivelarge companies paid no tax in 1988 and actually received refundsof past-year taxes, resulting in negative tax rates.   They were: Kroger, $29 million profit and a negative tax rate of28.3 percent; Pinnacle West, $75 million profit, minus 28.1percent; CSX, $402 million profit, minus 14.7 percent; IllinoisPower, $227 million profit, minus 11.3 percent, and Media General,$75 million profit, minus 5.7 percent.   Gulf States Utilities was reported as having a profit of $164million and neither paying a 1988 tax nor receiving any refund.   The highest effective tax rate among the 250 companies was paidby Rockwell International, at 192.5 percent. The company, a majordefense contractor, paid $1.37 billion tax last year on profits of$714 million. The study said the high rate reflected Rockwell'spayment of more than $1 billion of tax that was deferred during1981-1987.   The 250 companies in 1988 paid $34.5 billion tax on $130 billionin profits, an average effective rate of 26.5 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
