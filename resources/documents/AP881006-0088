For Seating Khmer Rouge</HEAD><BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Photographer Dith Pran, who barely escapedCambodia's killing fields, denounced the United Nations forallowing the Khmer Rouge to be seated as part of the Cambodiandelegation.   ``I am still shocked when I see the Khmer Rouge flag on U.N.territory. How would you feel if you were Jewish and you sawHitler's flag flying at the U.N.?'' Dith said Wednesday to a crowdof about 250 demonstrators.   In 1975, when the Khmer Rouge toppled Cambodia's government,Dith was trapped in the country. Like most of the population, heendured famine and forced labor on a collective farm, but managedto escape to Thailand in 1979.   Dith is now a photographer for The New York Times. His ordeal,and that of his people, received worldwide attention in the movie``The Killing Fields.''   About 2 million of Cambodia's 8 million people died under theKhmer Rouge's attempt to impose agrarian communism from 1975 to1979. Vietnam invaded Cambodia in late 1978 and ousted Pol Pot'sKhmer Rouge regime.   Wednesday's protest coincided with Cambodia's speech to the 43rdGeneral Assembly, with the Khmer Rouge sharing a seat in thedelegation. The vigil was organized by the Oxfam America reliefagency.   Oxfam's executive director John Hammock and several of itsofficers began a three-day fast Wednesday to protest the KhmerRouge membership in the United Nations.   ``There is no justice yet,'' said Dith, his voice strained withanger. ``Justice and peace haven't come to my country. ... I wantto see the Cambodians happy. I want to see Cambodians smilingagain.''   In an effort to root all Western influence out of Cambodia, theKhmer Rouge renamed 1975 ``Year Zero,'' and sent city-dwellers towork on collective farms.   Dith was among the forced laborers until he escaped across theThai border to a refugee camp.   Oxfam, Dith, and many Cambodians fear that the Khmer Rouge, thebest armed of the three groups fighting the Phnom Penh government,will seize power. The Khmer Rouge are backed by China.   Hanoi has said it will withdraw 50,000 of its 120,000 occupationtroops from Cambodia this year and that all are to be out by late1989 or early 1990.   Many people fear the Khmer Rouge will fill the military andpolitical void left by the retreating Vietnamese.   The resistance coalition also includes the non-communist KhmerPeople's National Liberation Front of Son Samm and forces loyal toformer Cambodian head of state Prince Norodom Sihanouk.   Under the U.N. Charter and international law, the United Nationssays it cannot recognize a government imposed on a country byoutside force, such as the current Cambodian government installedby Hanoi.</TEXT></DOC>
