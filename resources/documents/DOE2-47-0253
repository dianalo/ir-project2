The impacts of forest damage caused by acid rain arepresented from a genetic view. As acute and urgent measures to be takenby forest genetics are featured the following: Conservation of geneticdiversity of forest tree populations. Scientific support of seed supplyactivities concerning best adapted material for the affected sites. Theprogramme will be accompanied by isozyme analysis of the different progenies.This may contribute to improve the knowledge about genetic structuresand to detect relations between genetic potentials and emmission tolerance.</TEXT></DOC>
