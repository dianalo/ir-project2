In the African DevelopmentBank Act, Congress amended section 16 of the Glass-Steagall Act, 12 U.S.C.24(Seventh), to include obligations of the African Development Bank amongthose obligations, commonly referred to as ``Type II Securities,'' thatbanks may underwrite and deal in, and that are eligible for national banksto purchase for their own accounts subject to a limitation of ten percentof capital and surplus on the amount that may be held per obligor. <T3>See </T3>African Development Bank Act, Pub. L. No. 97-35, section 1342(a),95 Stat. 357, 743 (1981). Congress' provision of the described authoritywas not conditioned on the OCC's adoption of an implementing regulation.Therefore, our revision of the Regulation to specifically include AfricanDevelopment Bank obligations as Type II Securities does not alter banks'existing securities underwriting, dealing, or investment authority. <T3>See </T3>Interpretive Letter 392 from Robert L. Clarke, Comptrollerof the Currency (June 25, 1987), <T3>reprinted in </T3>Fed. Banking L. Rep. (CCH) andpara;85,616 (recognizingthat national banks may exercise the subject authority regarding AfricanDevelopment Bank obligations pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 24(Seventh) prior toOCC revision of the Regulation).Similarly, this action updates the Regulation to reflect national banks'existing powers with respect to obligations of the Inter-American InvestmentCorporation. In the Foreign Assistance and Related Appropriations Act,1985, Congress amended 12 U.S.C. 24(Seventh) to include obligations ofthe Inter-American Investment Corporation as Type II Securities withoutrequiring an implementing regulation by OCC. <T3>See </T3>Foreign Assistance and Related Appropriations Act, 1985, Pub.L. No. 98-473, Title I, 98 Stat. 1837, 1885 (1984) (enacting Title II ofS. 2416, as introduced in the Senate on March 13, 1984); S. 2416, 98thCong., 2d Sess. section 211(a), 130 Cong. Rec. S2622-3 (daily ed. March13, 1984) (containing provision that was enacted to amend 12 U.S.C. 24(Seventh)as described). Therefore, our revision of the Regulation to specificallyinclude Inter-American Investment Corporation obligations as Type II Securitiesdoes not alter banks' existing securities underwriting, dealing, or investmentauthority.We are also revising the Regulation by deleting an outdated and unnecessaryprovision that describes procedures for banks to request rulings on matterspertaining to the Regulation. The subject provision, 12 CFR 1.9, requiresthat banks send their requests to the Deputy Comptroller for Bank Operations_aposition that no longer exists_and to include sufficient facts and analysisto enable the OCC to make a determination. Rather than revise andSection;1.9 to direct requests to a current OCC official, we are removing the sectionfrom the Regulation because there is no need to continue the requirementthat requests be directed to one official or to remind banks to accompanytheir requests with appropriate information. Banks may therefore submitrequests for rulings regarding the Regulation in accordance with ordinarypractices for requesting OCC legal opinions. The deletion of andSection;1.9 is not expected to affect the OCC's processing or banks' submissionof requests regarding the Regulation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Technical Explanation of Revisions</ITAG>Currently, 12 CFR 1.3(d) defines ``Type II Security'' by describing suchsecurities as those obligations that banks may deal in, underwrite, andpurchase subject to a ten percent limitation, and then enumerates specificexamples of such obligations. We are amending andSection; 1.3(d) to specificallyinclude African Development Bank and Inter-American Investment Corporationobligations among the enumerated Type II Securities and to include a genericreference to all Type II securities listed in 12 U.S.C. 24(Seventh). Norevision is required for 12 CFR 1.5, which describes the qualitative standardsapplicable to purchases of Type II Securities for a bank's own account,or for 12 CFR 1.7, which describes the ten percent quantitative limitationon holdings of Type II Securities, since those sections refer to all TypeII Securities generically rather than enumerating particular Type II Securities.We are amending the description of banks' authority to underwrite and dealin Type II Securities at 12 CFR 1.6 to remove that section's current enumerationof particular Type II Securities to which the underwriting and dealingauthority applies, and adding a generic reference to all Type II Securitiesso that andSection; 1.6 will not require updating to reflect any future additionsof Type II Securities by Congress.Finally, we are removing the provision at 12 CFR 1.9 for requesting OCCrulings on the Regulation. To reflect the removal of andSection; 1.9, weare deleting the existing references to that section from 12 CFR 1.4 and1.100(b). We are also changing the numbering of the sections that followandSection; 1.9 to reflect the removal of that section. Specifically, andSection;andSection;1.10, 1.11 and 1.12 are being renumbered as andSection;andSection; 1.09, 1.10and 1.11, respectively. The existing cross-reference at 12 CFR 1.4 to andSection;1.11 is being changed to cross-reference andSection; 1.10 to reflect thedescribed renumbering.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Analysis</ITAG>Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, Pub.
