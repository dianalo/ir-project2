About 2,000 radical students and dissidents shouting ``Down withRoh Tae-woo the murderer'' battled police in the center of Seoulfor a second day to protest the inauguration. Police with riotshields charged the protesters.   Police said there were injuries on both sides, but had nofigures.   The general public was barred from the inauguration ceremony infront ot the National Assembly building and there were no publiccelebrations. The invitation-only ceremony was subdued and Rohreceived mild applause from the 25,000 guests, most of whom wereofficials.   Roh looked calm and thoughtful as he took the oath of office tobecome South Korea's sixth president.   He vowed to end human rights abuses and dictatorial rule. Hepromised sweeping democratic, economic and social reforms to giveall Koreans a voice in society.   ``The day when freedoms and human rights could be slighted inthe name of economic growth and national security has ended. Theday when repressive force and torture in secret chambers weretolerated is over,'' Roh said in a speech.   Outgoing President Chun Doo-hwan, disliked by many Koreans forhis tough authoritarian rule, listened impassively. The two menembraced at the end of the ceremony and shook hands.   Roh, taking office in the first peaceful transfer of power inthe nation's turbulent 40-year history, said the time had come forSouth Korea to become a full democracy.   After Roh was sworn in, 1,000 pigeons were released into hazywinter skies and army cannons fired a 21-gun salute, choirs sangpatriotic songs and a traditional orchestra in red robes playedoriental songs.   Thousands of riot police and plainclothes agents, anticipatingviolence after clashes with students in Seoul and two other citiesWednesday, stood guard at the inauguration and there were noincidents.   But around Myongdong Cathedral, masked protesters pelted riotpolice with rocks, bricks and firebombs that exploded in orangeshowers of liquid flame, setting several officers ablaze.   Many students shouted anti-American slogans claiming the UnitedStates had rigged the election that put Roh in power. ``Down withthe U.S.,'' protesters yelled.   Riot police chased bands of students who blocked main roads andtied up rush-hour traffic. Clashes were also reported in thesouthern cities of Masan, Sunchon, Pusan and Kwangju.   Hundreds of protesters hurling firebombs set fire to a woodenarch set up to celebrate the inauguration in Kwangju, site of a1980 anti-government uprising that was bloodyly suppressed by thearmy.   But onlookers ignored calls by the demonstrators to supportthem. Police broke up the protests with a huge show of force anddozens of students were arrested.   Roh rode to and from the ceremony in a heavily-guarded convoy.Detachments of riot police in green combat fatigues and black metalhelmets stood guard in nearby sidestreets.   Roh appealed to opposition groups to join him in building anenduring democratic system but warned that the violent,confrontational politics of the past had to end and he would nottolerate disorder.   One of the country's two main opposition parties, the Party forPeace and Democracy, promptly rejected Roh's peace offering, sayinghe had no right to rule and won election with massive fraud.   Roh won the country's first democratic presidential election in16 years on Dec. 16 with 36.6 percent of the vote. He defeatedrival opposition candidates Kim Young-sam and Kim Dae-jung, whosplit the opposition vote. Kim Young-sam later resigned asopposition leader.   Chun, who stepped down at the end of a seven-year term, bowed todemands for direct presidential elections after massive violentprotests last June.   In his inaugural speech, Roh said South Korea had to end thepolitical and regional divisions that have split the nation of 41million people. He appealed to the nation to bury past hatreds andstrive for reconciliation.   Many Koreans distrust him because he is a former general and sayhe lacks a mandate since he did not win an electoral majority. Hisdecision to retain hardliners in his Cabinet also has worriedKoreans who want reforms.</TEXT></DOC>
