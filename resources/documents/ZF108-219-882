(Caterpillar Inctries computer-aided software engineering)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Knight, Robert.andM;</AUTHOR><SUMMARY>Caterpillar Inc is experimenting with computer-aided softwareengineering (CASE) to automate the parts distribution system ofits Peoria, IL, manufacturing plant.andP;  Caterpillar is one of thefirst manufacturers to apply CASE, mainly because of a perceivedgulf between software development on the shop floor and softwaredevelopment done in the MIS industry.andP;  The lack of trulycomprehensive CASE tools also discourages manufacturingindustries.andP;  Caterpillar is solving some of these problems byfocusing on a major policy overhaul, implementing manufacturingresource planning, just-in-time processing and new scheduling andpurchasing systems prior to implementing CASE.andP;  Caterpillar isalso working with outside companies to make the implementationsmoother, including Anderson Consulting (St.andP;  Louis) forapplications, IBM for hardware and software technology, andKnowledgeWare for software tools.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Company:   Caterpillar Inc.

 Yet, Caterpillar's customers required immediateresponse when they needed a part.andM;The dilemma: how to respond to the customer's parts requirements within 48hours without straining inventories.andM;Wright and his colleagues turned to computer-aided software engineering(Case), making them one of the first--and still one of the very few-companiesto adopt Case as part of its manufacturing function.andM;CASE RARE IN SHOPSandM;According to Jim Behm, program manager for distributed software inmanufacturing for the Industrial Technology Institute (ITI) in Ann Arbor,Mich., Caterpillar's decision to use Case is rare in manufacturing.andP;  ITI is anonprofit organization, largely funded with federal and state grants, thattries to help U.S.andP;  manufacturers compete more effectively.andM;&quot;Case adoption is very slow in manufacturing,&quot; Behm said.andP;  He offered thefollowing reasons:andM;* Software developers in manufacturing generally do not have backgrounds incomputer science or software engineering; they are typically skilled inmechanical engineering or electrical engineering.andM;* Manufacturing software developers believe their software is different.andM;* Many characterize software development not as a discipline, but as anecessary evil.andM;* The shop floor is already crowded with packaged and custom softwaresolutions addressing a variety of specialized tasks.andM;* Case tools use a different language and mind-set.andP;  For example, &quot;They don'taddress programmable logic controllers and I'm not sure they should,&quot; Behmsaid.andM;*Shop floor workers and software developers in MIS tend to battle each otherfor turf.andP;  &quot;A gap exists between the people who write software for the plantfloor and the MIS troops,&quot; he said.andM;Behm, however, said he is confident that communication between informationsystem and manufacturing professionals will improve.andP;  The catalyst, he said,will be the International Standards Organization's Open SystemsInterconnection [OSI] model, once manufacturing automation/technical andoffice protocols (MAP/TOP) are more widely accepted.andM;CASE WINS SOME GROUNDandM;In the meantime, Behm said that previously unavailable Case-like tools thatallow manufacturing engineers to write their own control systems are justbeginning to appear.andP;  One such tool, according to Behm, is Savoir Flexus fromSavoir Inc. in Hayward, Calif.andM;Although acceptance is coming slowly, some ITI clients are beginning to useCase tools, according to Mark Brown, the organization's program manager forfactory systems design.andM;&quot;I have introduced Case techniques into the arena of specifying manufacturingsystems, using Case documentation tools like Yourdon-DeMarco, at one of theBig 3 automakers,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;We've applied Case to other actual systems aswell: a gear-weld line for an auto company, a materials-handling system for afirst-tier supplier to the automotives, and a trim-chassis final vehicle-bodyassembly.andM;&quot;One of the charters of the institute is to make advanced technology morepalatable to the guys on the floor,&quot; Brown said.andP;  Manufacturing people resistCase because of a &quot;chasm between specifications and design, a canyon betweenstructured analysis and structured design.andP;  It's a missing link betweenwriting the bubble and dataflow diagrams and turning all that into code andprocedures.andM;&quot;You get this great structured-analysis diagram that tells you what you wantto do, but you've still got to do it,&quot; Brown said.andP;  &quot;People have gone downthat path and think it's going to be an end-all technology, and then they getdisappointed.&quot;andP;  He continued, &quot;There's a whole set of vendors capitalizing onthe visible aspects of Case, but there's not a comprehensive set of tools inmanufacturing to specify design and implement software--even to testsoftware.&quot;andM;He added that many Case users have been misled by information systems peoplewho say, &quot;Just give us the right requirements and we'll make Case work foryou.&quot;andP;  The trouble is, Brown said, &quot;one of the hardest things to do is tospecify the correct set of requirements.andP;  They're dynamic; the life cyclekeeps redefining the specifications.&quot;andM;Intercim of Austin, Texas, and Minneapolis, has developed its own point ofview about Case in manufacturing.andP;  Because it wants to use Case tools andtechniques for its own products, the company has renewed its interest in thesubject.andP;  James McGuire, chief executive officer, based in Minneapolis, cameto Intercim from Nastec Corp. of Southfield, Mich., one of the first Casecompanies.andM;And because Intercim builds software specifically for manufacturing, Intercimanticipates more Case applications in the factory plant.andM;&quot;The area we see the most potential is on the shop floor,&quot; reported TomMagazzine, Intercim's president and chief operating officer in Austin.andM;&quot;Areas like work-in-process tracking and whole-data collection areas coulduse Case tools to simulate graphically the flow of materials and parts.andP;  Theshop floor is also the least mature area of the entire manufacturingmarketplace, so it's going to demand more adaptability and user friendliness,and that's the way the whole industry is going.&quot;andM;FEAR OF BEING BURNEDandM;But it is not happening yet, Magazine said.andP;  He blamed much of the resistanceon the fear of being burned--again.andP;  Manufacturing software developers, hesuggested, have an attitude that &quot;if it ain't broke, don't fix it.&quot;andP;  He said,&quot;Manufacturing is just coming out of a cycle of a lot of false starts inareas like robotics and computer vision.andP;  Case is ahead of the marketmaturity in general.&quot;andM;Another obstacle, according to Magazzine, is that manufacturing has notattracted many trained software innovators.andP;  &quot;A lot of people coming out ofschool don't view manufacturing as a place to develop computer sciencetechniques.&quot;andM;Despite the obstacles, Caterpillar decided to be innovative in the use ofCase tools.andM;&quot;We were sick and tired of not using good tools in information services; wedidn't want to keep writing everything in native Cobol and start each newsystem from scratch,&quot; Wright said.andM;Though Case found a role in parts distribution, not on the shop floor, itsinception would not have come about if managers had not examined themanufacturing system first.andP;  They dubbed it &quot;Plant with a Future,&quot; and itquickly became more than a concept.andM;After reviewing what the company needed in order to be competitive,Caterpillar's developers began implementing manufacturing resource planning(MRP), just-in-time (JIT) processing, improved shop scheduling, a newpurchasing system and a new philosophy of dealing with suppliers aspartners--all before implementing Case.andM;&quot;The point was it was all going to be integrated so Caterpillar would looklike one company to our dealers,&quot; Wright said.andP;  &quot;And it meant terrific userinvolvement.&quot;andM;Only after Caterpillar's management formed an Integrated Policy Committee andscheduled weekly meetings--which have continued for more than 18 months--didthe firm begin to address Case tools.andM;DISCIPLINE THE KEYandM;&quot;We decided we were going to have to establish partnerships with outsideorganizations for tasks we couldn't do ourselves; for their expertise and tohelp with the grunt work.andP;  We selected Andersen Consulting [St.andP;  Louisoffice] for the applications and IBM for the hardware and softwaretechnology,&quot; Wright said.andM;The company selected tools from KnowledgeWare of Atlanta for &quot;upper Case&quot;functions such as requirement definition and data modeling.andP;  Andersenprovided the Foundation tool set for lower Case system design, codegeneration and maintenance, and built a bridge to the KnowledgeWarerepository.andM;One reason Caterpillar chose Andersen: &quot;They introduced us to a projectmanagement technique that just flat-out works,&quot; Wright said.andP;  &quot;It gives us aseries of disciplines through the life cycle.andP;  Everything is done the sameway.andP;  The key word is discipline.andP;  They just won't let you do thingsdifferently unnecessarily.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
