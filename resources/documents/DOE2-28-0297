The improvement comprises adding maleicanhydride and limestone to the absorbed solution during the residencetime of the absorbed solution, the resulting absorbed solution beingoxidized with an oxygen-contaning gas to reproduce an absorbing solutiontherefrom so as to be effectively reused for absorbing the sulfure dioxidein the off-gas for separation. 1 fig.</TEXT></DOC>
