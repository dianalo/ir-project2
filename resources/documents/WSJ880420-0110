A time capsule of gray limestone, the Harry S. Truman Library and Museum enfolds the grave of a president and the mementos of a tumultuous era. Scholars, tourists, even modern campaign technicians come here as if searching for some enduring secret or talisman. Yet this time capsule speaks not of permanence but of change: four decades that have transformed presidential campaigns, presidential candidates and the Democratic Party itself.    These transformations stand between the Truman era and ours &quot;like a towering mountain range,&quot; says Truman historian Richard Kirkendall of Iowa State University.    The more today's candidates compare themselves to the little gamecock who scattered S.O.B.s like shrapnel and threatened to kick a journalist in his most tender parts, the more controlled most of them have become. The more they study his vivid &quot;Give 'em hell&quot; upset of 1948 -- and 1988 hopefuls Paul Simon and Richard Gephardt sent image makers here to do just that -- the more most campaigns move toward a paint-by-the-numbers blandness.    &quot;It's the Johnny Carsonization of politics,&quot; says Republican consultant Todd Domke. &quot;We now expect our president to be our very own moderator.    &quot;In Truman's time his flaws, his humanness, became strengths. Tom Dewey, by comparison, became 'the little man on the wedding cake.' But today we're looking for the man on the wedding cake. Dewey has finally beaten Truman, in a way.&quot;    Truman scholars agree: None of the 1988 Democratic hopefuls is another Harry -- not even close. One historian, Donald McCoy of the University of Kansas, advances a heretical notion: In terms of personality, 1988's most Trumanesque candidate was a Republican, Kansas Sen. Bob Dole. Another historian, Ohio University's Alonzo L. Hamby, sees more of Ronald Reagan than Michael Dukakis in the foreign policy of the Democrat who dropped the atomic bomb and sent GIs to Korea.    On another level, ABC White House correspondent Sam Donaldson fears the unvarnished Harry would be eaten alive by today's candidate smoothies and the piranha-like press.    &quot;Your first romantic instinct is to say, Christ, we need more Harry Trumans -- not all these blow-dried Mr. Blands,&quot; says Mr. Donaldson. &quot;But the truth is, I don't think he'd go down well. Candidates are walking on eggshells out there, and we are looking for every egregious statement.&quot;    The press would find plenty in Harry Truman. Here was a man who, by some accounts, was barely persuaded by his wife Bess to substitute the words &quot;horse manure&quot; for something worse. Who blurted out, even as the Cold War with Stalin's Russia intensified, &quot;I like Old Joe.&quot; Who wrote to Washington Post music critic Paul Hume (who had just panned daughter Margaret's singing) that if they ever met, &quot;you'll need a new nose . . . and perhaps a supporter below.&quot; Who lived much of his life with a mother-in-law who wished her daughter had married higher -- and who privately seemed to regard his 1948 defeat as inevitable. Critics jeered: &quot;To err is Truman.&quot;    &quot;Things just weren't staged like they are today,&quot; says the Truman Library director, Benedict Zobrist. &quot;We've got black-and-white film of a State of the Union address where some page or Secret Service man is standing in front of the podium, chewing gum. We've got films of bill signings so cornball they seem like the Three Stooges -- people keep bumping into each other. Television has changed everything.&quot;    Including the campaign itself. Between stops, Harry Truman played poker with reporters. Today's press corps, elephantine and omnipresent, follows in chartered planes.    Campaigning has become a trial by ordeal, the equivalent of Indian rituals that tortured a man to test his fitness to lead. Truman whistle-stopped 21,928 miles in the fall of 1948, a prodigious effort he feared might &quot;kill some of my staff.&quot; Michael Dukakis has jetted 264,812 miles in the past 12 months and is just getting warmed up.    President Truman spent just $2.7 million in his fall campaign. Today's hopefuls may spend up to 10 times that just on primaries and an additional $46 million (in public money) if nominated.    &quot;We are auctioning off the presidency of the United States to the man who can raise the most money,&quot; thunders Florida Rep. Claude Pepper. &quot;We are awarding it to the man who can physically endure the process.&quot;    Mr. Pepper, at 87, is a kind of time capsule himself. He is one of two sitting members of Congress who ran against Harry Truman in 1948. Then-Sen. Pepper, fearful of a Democratic debacle, offered himself as nominee just before the convention. His boomlet soared for two days. &quot;I had to find another hotel with room enough to accommodate all the people who wanted to see me,&quot; he recalls. Then presidential lieutenants started twisting arms, and &quot;about the third day, I had plenty of room.&quot;    South Carolina Sen. Strom Thurmond -- then a Democrat -- went further. He launched an independent campaign and won 39 electoral votes. &quot;If we'd had TV then, we would have thrown that election into the House,&quot; he grumbles. What's striking is how, after all these years, Sen. Thurmond's voice still rasps with indignation as he talks about his old foe.    That's because Harry Truman was a polarizer, not a conciliator. He knew his own mind and spoke it undiplomatically: He once summed up his opposition to John F. Kennedy's 1960 nomination and his disdain for the senator's father by declaring, &quot;It's not the Pope, it's the Pop.&quot;    But there was something natural about his bluntness. He was formed in a different way from the typical candidate of today.    He was largely shaped outside politics; they have been largely shaped inside politics. He was a farmer and failed haberdasher long before he finally became a senator, at age 50. Albert Gore, already running for president at 40, has been in Congress since he was 28; politics has become a full-time career in itself. Earnestly talking day care and health insurance at a New York forum recently, Sen. Gore displayed all the passion of a city manager discussing potholes.    Michael Dukakis, another cerebral technocrat, does share Mr. Truman's &quot;strong interest in economic growth,&quot; says Mr. Kirkendall, the Iowa State historian. But that's about all. &quot;The Truman passion for people, the tradition of getting your pants a little dirty, sometimes seems missing in Mike,&quot; says Democratic pollster Paul Maslin, who has been working for rival Paul Simon. Jesse Jackson, adds Mr. Maslin, at least shares one thing with Mr. Truman: &quot;a quality of realness.&quot;    Presidents, even Republicans, have been latching on to the Truman coattails for decades. Gerald Ford kept a Truman bust in the Oval Office. Richard Nixon, once described by Mr. Truman as &quot;talking out of both sides of his mouth at the same time and lying out of both sides,&quot; showed up to serenade Mr. and Mrs. Truman with the &quot;Missouri Waltz.&quot; Jimmy Carter kept the original &quot;The Buck Stops Here&quot; sign on his desk. But an editorial cartoon filed away at the library here depicts Mr. Carter as a hapless little man behind a sign reading &quot;My Luck Stops Here.&quot;    University of Kansas historian McCoy sees more parallels with Bob Dole. &quot;For each,&quot; he says, &quot;military experience was the extreme test of masculinity.&quot; Mr. Dole, now out of the race, also has an alley-cat scrappiness -- which, when he ran, did him more harm than good.    It was a mixed blessing for Mr. Truman, too. His Gallup Poll approval rating sank to 23% at one point, a record until Jimmy Carter managed a 21%. It was only in 1975 -- after Watergate and more than two years after Mr. Truman's death -- that the Truman cult really began to build. As the rock group Chicago sang it at the time:   &quot;America needs you, Harry Truman. Harry, could you please come home?&quot;    Harry Truman won't be coming home. He already is home, buried in a sheltered courtyard here. He was the unique product of unique circumstances. And if he did come back, what would he think about the lethal political environment we've created? Perhaps he might call it &quot;horse manure&quot; -- if he was trying to be tactful. </TEXT></DOC>
