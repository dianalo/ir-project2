it no doubt alsohopes that marketing it as a product will bring in some revenue while itworks to get its super to market.andM;- o -andM;Videologic Ltd, based in Kings Langley, Hertfordshire, has been awarded a #1mcontract by the Deutsche Bundespost to supply 1,000 DVA-4000 digital videoadaptor boards: the boards will be part of a new high technology trainingsystem for Bundespost employees that is based on interactive videotechniques; Nokia Data is providing the training system and personalcomputers and disk players are coming from Sony Corp; Prolernen GmbH is alsoinvolved in the project and apart from training the Bundespost's installationengineers, is to supply the DVA-4000 boards to Nokia and provide localsupport and consultancy on the implementation.andM;- o -andM;The Romtec Ltd research organisation is forecasting an 85% growth in NationalHealth Service information technology spending over the next three years:Romtec says that the impetus for growth is coming from the government'srecent White Paper and the number of pilot schemes currently running in majorhospitals and district authorities; however, IT in the Health Servicehighlights that spending in this sector is currently very low, and DistrictIT spend represents less than 0.5% of the Health Service's total budget;hardware suppliers rather than software houses are expected to remain themost important source of systems, and NHS buyers are said to be looking forfinancial stability in suppliers rather than an NHS track record; personalcomputers are a particular area of growth, and 92% of District respondentsreported increased per-sonal computer budgets, with 39% of IT managersreporting 20% growth.andM;- o -andM;Non-standard electronic data interchange systems are a growing threat to anumber of companies that wish to exploit paperless trading: the ArticleNumber Association, a body responsible for promoting the use of internationalstandards for product coding, bar code symbols and electronic datainterchange, says that many organisations have one-to-one systems that linkwith a major customer but cannot be used to trade with other partners; theAssociation warns that non-standard systems will leave companies isolated aselectronic data interchange becomes a precondition of a starting a commercialrelationship.andM;- o -andM;Formerly with Data General GmbH, Kristoffer Sygel has joined MIPS ComputerSystems Inc as vice-president of its European operations.andM;- o -andM;San Jose, California-based Xilinx Inc, which claims to be the inventor of thefield programmable gate array, has introduced the first members of its thirdgeneration XC4000: the XC4005, XC4006, XC4008 and XC4010 incorporate severalsystem-level functions on-chip to provide the highest performance availablein the industry, and says it has started shipping the XACT 4000, a completelyredefined computer-aided engineering development system that &quot;delivers 100%placement and routing of designs&quot;: the first XC4000 devices have systemspeeds up to 60MHz and a density range of 5,000 to 10,000 usable gates and a100% performance increase was achieved by integrating seven system featuresonto the chip for the first time - on-chip memory, high-speed counters anddecoders and JTAG boundary scan logic; sampling first quarter, the firstavailable device, the XC4005, with 5,000 usable gates, costs $192.50.andM;- o -andM;London-based DataFlex Ltd's applications development database is nowavailable on ICL's recently launched DRS 3000 machine - at #2,300.andM;- o -andM;IBM has launched the Power Club, to establish closer working relationshipswith independent software vendors converting their software for AIX on theRS/6000 Unix machines: Bedford-based Facts Software Ltd becomes one of thefirst members with implementation of its Unifacts X accounting software.andM;- o -andM;Frontline Distribution Ltd, based in Basingstoke, Hampshire has a beenappointed the UK distributor for GraphOn Corp's 21&quot; X-terminal: the VDU sellsfor #1,700 in the UK.andM;- o -andM;Richardson, Texas-based high-performance maths co-processor designer CyrixCorp says it will offer free of charge, the IEEE 754-1990 standard test suitefor binary computer arithmetic conformance: developed at the University ofCalifornia at Berkeley, the test evaluates performance in all data formatssupported by 80386-based personal computers, and determines whether or notmaths co-processors produce results that conform to the IEEE standard for80-bit arithmetic - it seems the company hopes that other developers of mathsco-processors will find it so hard to conform to the standards that they willgive up their efforts in despair; it points out that among the problems thatcan arise with chips that don't meet the spec are mathematically incorrectresults; dirty arithmetic leading to mathematically incorrect results; designfeatures hindering the assembly code programmer; and lack of faithfulness tothe IEEE arithmetic standard; one copy per customer, please.andM;- o -andM;SAS Institute Inc has opened a new office in Peking - it's headed by SAS HongKong's marketing manager Jeff Lo - and other sites in Shanghai, and eitherChengdu or Wuhan are planned for the next couple of years: the firm says itnow has 15 SAS System installations in China.andM;- o -andM;Stratus Computer Inc, Marlborough, Massachusetts, is to market Atlanta,Georgia-based Scientific Software Inc's Network Express application forlinking proprietary hardware, software and networking platforms on its XA2000 fault-tolerant system: it costs $6,800; Stratus has also announcedversion 2.0 of its OSI Server for developing Open SystemsInterconnection-compliant applications on the XA 2000 machines, priced at$2,200.andM;- o -andM;ATandamp;T Network Systems and Eicon Technology Inc have introduced a new gatewaydevice called the Local Area Network Communications Server that is said tolink personal computer users regardless of distance: it acts as a gatewayinto ATandamp;T's Datakit II Virtual Circuit Switch, through which users canconnect to host computers or compatible networks also served by Datakit IIVCS; the Communications Server consists of an ATandamp;T Model 6386 personalcomputer configured with a standard token ring or StarLAN interface card, theEiconCard intelligent co-processor board, and Eicon's Access Gatewaysoftware.andM;- o -andM;LSI Logic Corp has appointed James Panfil to the new post of director ofmicroprocessor products for Europe - he comes in from Intel Corp.andM;- o -andM;The gloves came off on Friday in the battle between ATandamp;T Co and the board ofNCR Corp over the soul of the Daytoner: NCR's board unanimously rejectedATandamp;T's $90 a share hostile tender offer as &quot;grossly inadequate and unfair toNCR's shareholders and other important stakeholders&quot; - &quot;Clearly, ATandamp;T isattempting, for its own purposes, to take advantage of NCR's artificially andtemporarily depressed stock price; we cannot and will not permit them toseize for themselves the enormous values that are building steadily withinNCR,&quot; said Charles Exley, chief executive; &quot;having 'just said no' to thisgrossly inadequate offer, we are focused on implementing the businessstrategy that will continue to build very real and very significant value forNCR shareholders, customers and employees,&quot; he said.andM;- o -andM;Backing up its words with deeds, NCR Corp then filed suit in the US DistrictCourt in Dayton alleging that ATandamp;T Co's filings in its tender offer to NCRshareholders are &quot;false, manipulative and misleading&quot; and are in violation ofthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules and regulations of theSecurities andamp; Exchange Commission: it alleges among other things, that ATandamp;Tfilings failed to disclose that the tender offer is conditional on NCR'sboard approving a friendly transaction with ATandamp;T and omitted data on ATandamp;T'sfailure in the computer industry as well as failing to disclose the unbrokenstring of failed mergers between computer companies - and falsely indicatedthat it may be willing to wait 18 months to complete a business combination;the suit seeks declaratory and injunctive relief over ATandamp;T's allegedviolations.andM;- o -andM;All regulatory and bondholder approvals have now been secured to make themerger between Mountain Bell, Northwestern Bell and Pacific Northwest Bellunder the corporate name US West Communications Inc and the merger will beeffective on January 1, 1991: the three have been operating as a singleentity since 1988, but each had its own long-term debt issues outstanding.andM;- o -andM;Unix International Inc says it is planning to open a centre in Japan toprovide facilities for independent software vendors to convert theirapplications for Unix System V.4: it will also provide education andtraining, and will serve as a technology showcase for System V.4.andM;- o -andM;There will be a whole lot more worry about just what kind of moviesMatsushita Electric Industrial Co might make - and not make - if it succeedsin its bid for MCA Inc when this reaches Hollywood: Matsushita consumerelectronics distribution subsidiary Quasar Co, Franklin Park, Illinois hasbeen found guilty of violating US civil rights laws and ordered to pay threeAmerican managers fired by the company in 1986 $2.5m plus expenses after itdismissed most of its American managers to stem big losses, but retained allits Japanese managers.andM;- o -andM;Granada Group Plc has decided to decentralised sales and marketing functionsto the individual companies in its Granada Computer Services Internationalunit, leading to nine redundancies out of a staff of 38 at the Wokingham,Berkshire international head office.andM;- o -andM;As well as blowing its own trumpet, Littleton, Massachusetts-based AlliantComputer Systems Corp is also doing Intel Corp a great favour in its campaignto publicise benchmarks achieved by its 80860 RISC-based FX/2800minisupercomputers: in its latest salvo, it says that the box, which sellsfor under $2m, exceeded 2 GFLOPS on a linear convolution software routinefrequently used in seismic exploration and in a wide range of signalprocessing applications and which is usually run on a Cray Research Y-MPeight processor supercomputer that costs over $15m; Alliant says that on theconvolution - used to process digital data acquired in oil exploration, radarand sonar signal processing, crystallography, communications, speechrecognition and speech synthesis, satellite image enhancement, highdefinition television research, vibration analysis and weather prediction - a28 processor Alliant FX/2828 exceeded 2,145 MFLOPS, which compares withCray's published figure of 2,012 MFLOPS on a Cray Y-MP eight processor model,and the peak theoretical performance of 200 MFLOPS on a Convex C240four-processor system.andM;- o -andM;Sun Microsystems Inc will be regularly buying its own shares in the market -but it won't affect the number outstanding because they will be reissuedunder its 1990 long-term equity incentive plan and its 1990 employee stockpurchase plan which were approved by the company's shareholders last week.andM;- o -andM;IBM does enough Good Works that it could never be labelled a Scrooge, and itbeing Christmastide, it has donated $3.5m to help finance 21 childcare andelder care projects in nine communities across the US where IBMers live andwork, and it represents the largest distribution from the $25m IBM Funds forDependent Care Initiatives since the programme was introduced last year.andM;- o -andM;In October 1989, MCI and ATandamp;T filed legal claims against each other allegingfalse and deceptive advertising, and on January 10, 1990, ATandamp;T sued MCI forfalse and deceptive telemarketing practices; the two companies have nowagreed an out-of-court settlement on their respective lawsuits although theterms of the settlement were not disclosed; they are going to proposesafeguards to the Federal Communications Commission that should protectconsumers against being switched to a long distance carrier without theirpermission - a practice that's known as slamming; the proposed safeguardswould require that at least one of the following take place before a longdistance service is switched; the consumer signs an authorisation card andsends it to the long distance carrier, or secondly, the consumer initiates acall to the local telephone company or the long distance carrier; thirdly,the consumer initiates a call from home to an automated toll-free 800 number,and through a sequence of prompts, confirms the choice of long distancecarrier, or finally, choice of a long distance carrier is verified by a firmunaffiliated with a any of the long distance carriers.andM;- o -andM;US Sprint has issued a statement in response to ATandamp;T's and MCI's proposals tocurb slamming: it says that it initiated proposals for protective measures inMarch and October and has since tightened its own procedures and safeguards;US Sprint's proposed standards to the FCC include mandatory, minimumdisclosures in solicitations, monitoring of telemarketing calls, 100%verification of telemarketing calls, auditing by an independent firm, freereturn to previous carrier in cases of errors, and LEC co-operation intelemarketing sales; in addition, Sprint pledges to work closely with theother carriers.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
