Life, these twomoneyed hedonists think, will be a fairy tale. They celebrateby having sex as soon as the plane is airborne.   One doesn't have to be a genius to predict that Mr. andMrs. Court will get their comeuppance. After all, if acts ofgross selfishness such as theirs led to living happily everafter it would still be the 1980s on Wall Street, LeonaHelmsley would remain a happy hotelier and no one would havegotten angry at the czars.</LP><TEXT>   In Maggie Gee's &quot;Christopher andamp; Alexandra&quot; (Ticknor andamp;Fields, 377 pages, $19.95), the good years last until themillennium. But the post-2000 disasters are amply forecast bythe device of having Christopher and Alexandra narrate theirstory looking back from 2005.   By then, Alexandra is 55 years old and desperately,improbably, trying to get pregnant or become a mother throughadoption. Her lover and prospective father is a man of 30.Earlier she has taken another lover because, &quot;I like newthings. I like a change.&quot;   Perhaps the best preparation for meeting Christopher andAlexandra comes from F. Scott Fitzgerald's famous descriptionof the Buchanans. &quot;They were careless people, Tom and Daisy-- they smashed up things and creatures and then retreatedback into their money or their vast carelessness, or whateverit was that kept them together, and let other people clean upthe mess they had made,&quot; Fitzgerald wrote in &quot;The GreatGatsby.&quot;   Fitzgerald established distance by having an objectivenarrator tell his story. Ms. Gee gives her Tom and Daisycontrol of this book. The result is a novel much moregenerous to its characters than seems warranted. Christopher,for example, is a boring wimp who, in other hands, could benicely sliced to pieces as an example of what happens whentoo little backbone, too much money and a tendency to doone's thinking below one's belt are mixed up together.   At 70, Christopher is drunkenly fondling the cook at hisVenice flat and then happily riding into the techno-pornfuture on his beloved Interactive ReCreative Device. (Beforeanyone rushes out to pick one up, remember Chris is living in2007 when the IRD comes into vogue. If we all make it thatfar, maybe we can buy IRDs when we cash in our IRAs.)   If ever a fictional character seems ripe for a fall it isChristopher. But Ms. Gee is a very kind woman. FoolishChristopher ends up beloved by all. Foolish Alexandra, whobetrayed Christopher when she felt like it for reasons aboutas well thought out as those that drive some women to buy newshoes, gets a sharper punishment in terms of a shorter lifespan. But Ms. Gee isn't interested in irony or narrativeperspective. She is a storyteller who makes the voices ofChristopher and Alexandra unfailingly lively, but she iswriting romance. Her novel is, in the end, a modern fairytale.   Nothing in Chris's and Alex's lives is as painful as theend of their love, as they tell us repeatedly. &quot;Only he and Iwere real, I knew. Christopher and me, a world of two,&quot;Alexandra tells us of the beginning. In an equally romanticpassage, Christopher declares: &quot;I lived for love. Love leftme.&quot;   It is possible to admire the skill with which Ms. Geeestablishes the electric passion that drives Christopher andAlexandra to gamble on living for love. Their sense of losslooking back on what they had -- or dreamed they had -- iseloquent and vivid.   That core relationship is far more interesting than thelinked stories of the lives lived in Christopher andAlexandra's wake. Christopher's two abandoned children (theyare Alexandra's stepchildren) carry on sex lives almost asactive as Chris and Alex's. The boy is, in rapid-firesuccession, gay, successful in the art world, sick with AIDSand dead. The girl is often seduced, often abandoned andthree times ends unwanted pregnancies before she finds aconstant lover and bliss in motherhood.   Christopher is homophobic toward his son, if you canspecify the phobia of a man who has so totally abandoned hischild. His daughter, equally badly treated, makes generousroom for the old man when he reinserts himself into her life.   Alexandra's lack of motherhood is her torment, althoughshe aborted and abandoned to avoid maternity during heryounger years. Thus, Christopher gets off far easier thanAlexandra for having dreamed recklessly. For him there aresex toys and forgiveness at the end of the road. ForAlexandra only barrenness and disease.   Of course, to make all their happiness and unhappinesspossible Alexandra and Christopher needed deep pockets. Alack of cash separates most people from suffering theconsequences of their fondest imagined pleasures. Theprerequisite for so many dreams, as advertising for our statelotteries repeatedly reminds us, is wealth.   Which brings us back to Fitzgerald. The rich are differentfrom you and me, Fitzgerald wrote. Ernest Hemingwaymaliciously added: Yes, they have more money. An observer ofChristopher and Alexandra would have to add: They have moresex, too.</TEXT></DOC>
