He was replying to a questioner who suggested he was leavingempty-handed after talking with President Bush and leaders of hisadministration.   Diouf asked Bush for more help when he visited the White HouseMonday. White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater reported Bushsaid he was sympathetic but could not promise anything beyond the$40 million a year Senegal has been getting.   Diouf said he came to reaffirm links with the United States, theWorld Bank and the International Monetary Fund. And he said he hadample success and nothing to complain about.   He said it would be better to have more help, but it was wrongto think that African presidents came to Washington just to packtheir valises with aid.   Diouf spoke at length of the monument to be erected at Almadies,Africa's westernmost point, in memory of slaves put aboard ships inSenegal for sale in North America in past centuries. He said thestatue was not meant to show anger but as a symbol of a commondesire to end violence and alienation among peoples.</TEXT></DOC>
