This gives access ata very low functional level, enabling portability as well as incorporatingsome extremely powerful features.andP;  Initially Progress focussed on fast andefficient applications builders but then turned its attention tointer-operability, the ability to insulate the application from changes inhardware, operating system, database system and graphical interface.andP;  Version6 of the Progress application system will allow access to information storedin DEC's RDB/VMS database as well as Oracle and the firm's own databasemanager (CI No 1,305).andP;  Via the protocols TCP/IP, NetBIOS and DECnet it willaccess Oracle, RMS, RDB, both embedded and dynamic Standard Query Languageand X Window.andP;  Plans for future developments include triggers, new graphicalinterfaces, interfaces between software engineering tools and Progress andsupport for additional database managers.andP;  Progress is sold directly orthrough value-added resellers that can custom build an application.andP;  Version6 will be released in the second quater of next year, prices range from#1,000 for a small personal computer to #100,000 for a VAX multi-user system.andO;There are about 300 off-the-shelf applications and Progress Software hopes toincrease this number by 50% next year.andP;  Customers include the InternationalTreasury of the New York-based Citibank and the retail division of ICL.andO;Progress's fiscal year closed on the last day of November with 40% of its$25m turnover from Europe.andP;  This is a 50% increase on last year's figure.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
