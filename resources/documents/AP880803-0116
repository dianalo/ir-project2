Some 30,000 troops and 50,000 Turkish settlers occupy thenorthern part of Cyprus. Vassiliou will meet in New York on Aug. 24with Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash under U.N. auspices. TheCypriot president has proposed a federalized republic and theisland's demilitarization.   In the 14 years since the Turkish invasion, Vassiliou said, theUnited States has been ``unwilling to exert its influence tomoderate Turkey'' while promoting withdrawal of foreign troops inother countries.   ``Will foreign troops be withdrawn from everywhere but Cyprus?''he asked.   In effect, he said, the United States had taken a position infavor of Turkey and one that was inconsistent with American policyelsewhere. But he said he found the Reagan administration ready toplay a more active role.   At the same time, Vassiliou said the majority Greek Cypriotswould have to make concessions to the Turkish Cypriots, such asaccepting a Turkish province alongside the Greek Cypriot entity,both under a federal government.   ``We have to recognize, despite what we may have liked as Greeksin the past, that there is only one way to get this feeling ofsecurity for everybody concerned, to establish a real federation,''he said.   The two provinces would retain their governments, whatevershifts in population there might be, while police forces and courtswould be local to establish a feeling of trust, he said.   Vassiliou rejected a suggestion that Cypriots develop their ownnationalism.   ``The only way forward is for the Greek Cyrpiots to be proudthat they're Greeks and for the Turkish Cypriots to be proud thatthey're Turks and at the same time for both of them to recognizethat they were born on ... Cyprus, and that they should gettogether on that island,'' he said.   ``I don't think we can develop a kind of third type of Cyprusnation. There is no such thing as a Cypriot nation,'' Vassiliousaid. ``There are Cypriot Greeks and Cypriot Turks and therecognition is very important, because if you start saying, `I wanta Cypriot nation,' you will create a feeling of anxiety,''especially among the Turks, because they are in the minority.   Vassiliou, who is on a 10-day visit to the United States, met onMonday with President Reagan and Vice President George Bush. He ismeeting in Boston later today with Gov. Michael Dukakis, theDemocratic presidential nominee.</TEXT></DOC>
