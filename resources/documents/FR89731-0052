Background </ITAG>1. Program Description The Utilization and Quality Control Peer Review Organization (PRO) programis used to assure that health care services and items for which paymentmay be made in whole or part under the Medicare program are medically necessary,are delivered in the appropriate setting, and are of a quality which meetsprofessionally recognized standards. The PRO program was established bythe Peer Review Improvement Act of 1982 (Title I, Subtitle C of the TaxEquity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA), Pub. L. 97-248),which amended Subpart B of Title XI of the Social Security Act (the Act).The individual PROs may also contract with State agencies to provide reviewof health care services furnished under the Medicaid program, and withthe Department of Defense to provide review of health care services furnishedunder the Civilian Health and Medical Programs of the Uniformed Services(CHAMPUS). The PRO program is based on two fundamental concepts of healthcare review: that  physicians are the most appropriate persons to assessthe quality of medical care delivered by physicians; and that local community-basedpeer review and local standard setting are the most effective means forensuring appropriate utilization of health resources and facilities. Section 1153(a) of the Act requires the Secretary to divide the UnitedStates into geographic areas, designated as PRO areas, for the purposeof entering into contracts with entities to perform the peer review function.We do not need to issue regulations in order to designate or change PROareas because authority to designate or change PRO areas is within thebroad statutory authority given to the Secretary under section 1153 ofthe Act. However, we believe that it would be beneficial to permit interestedparties an opportunity to comment on any redesignations. Consequently,we are continuing our previously established notice and comment procedureto announce the redesignation of a PRO area. The current designation of PRO areas was announced on February 27, 1984(49 FR 7202). Each of the 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico,and the Virgin Islands were designated as separate review areas. At thesame time, the areas consisting of Guam, American Samoa, the Northern MarianaIslands and the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands were designatedas a single area for purpose of PRO review. 2. Area Designation Criteria Section 1153(a)(2) of the Act provides the criteria that the Secretaryis to use to designate PRO review areas. They are: andbullet; Each state must generally be designated as a geographic reviewarea for PRO purposes. andbullet; The Secretary must establish local or regional review areas onlywhere the volume of review activity or other relevant factors (as determinedby the Secretary) warrant such establishment, and the Secretary determinesthat review activity can be carried out with equal or greater efficiencyby establishing local or regional areas. In applying these requirements,the Secretary must take into account the number of Medicare and Medicaidhospital admissions in each State. Any State having less than 80,000 admissionsannually must be established as a single statewide area. andbullet; The Secretary may not establish a local or regional area havingfewer than 60,000 total admissions under review annually (including, publicand private pay patients) unless he or she determines that other relevantfactors warrant otherwise;andbullet; No local or regional review area may be designated that is nota self-contained medical service area having a full spectrum of medicalservices, including services of medical specialists.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Need for Revised Area Designation</ITAG>Our proposed notice to establish the original PRO review areas publishedon August 15, 1983 (48 FR 36976), included a recommendation that therebe a regional PRO review area comprised of the State of Hawaii togetherwith Guam, American Samoa, and the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands.A number of commenters objected to this proposed regional PRO review areabased on their view that, under the PRO program, the administration ofsuch a large geographic area would not be cost effective. After evaluationof these concerns in the final notice published February 27, 1984 (49 FR7209), we designated the State of Hawaii as a PRO review area. The areasconsisting of Guam, American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, and theTrust Territory of the Pacific Islands were establish as another PRO reviewarea.Since we established the PRO area consisting of Guam, American Samoa, theNorthern Mariana Islands, and the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islandas a single PRO review area, we have found it difficult to administer acontract with a local peer review organization. The statute imposes restrictions(relative to physician membership and the availability of physician reviewers)on the types of organizations eligible to contract as PROs. In this reviewarea, no eligible local organization has expressed an interest in competingfor the PRO contract, in response to our request for bids from local organizationsfor the contract award. Consequently, since 1984 the PRO contract for thisreview area has been awarded to the Hawaii PRO, separately and distinctfrom its contract to conduct review operations in Hawaii.Our experience indicates that the previous comments concerning the economicinefficiency of administering the large geographic area of the combinedHawaii and Pacific areas are no longer valid. In addition, since the Hawaiibased PRO has been responsible for the Medicare peer review in AmericanSamoa, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands for a substantial periodof time, we feel the designation of these review areas into a single reviewarea would not compromise the working relationship that has developed.Because the patient population in all of the affected areas is small, combiningthe areas also adds to efficient and effective program operations. Thesize of the resulting review data base will enhance meaningful demographicand statistical analysis. Furthermore, PRO surveillance of potential qualityof care concerns based on this increased data base should improve. We believecombining these two areas into a single, more efficient PRO area will notdimish current recognition of the unique characteristics of the beneficiarypopulation and local medical practice.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Revised PRO Area</ITAG>It is our intention that the area composed of the State of Hawaii, Guam,American Samoa and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands bea single designated PRO review area. (The trusteeship of the areas previouslyknown as the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands and mentioned in previousnotices has been dissolved by Congress. The remaining districts are noteligible for service under Title XVIII or Title XIX. Therefore, no PROreview area designation is necessary for these geographic areas.) This change is necessary because past experience shows there have beenno qualified local organizations to place bids for the PRO contract inthe existing review area. Maintaining the current designation of separatereview areas requires the administration of two separate contracts withthe same organization, an administrative burden to the Government and tothe PRO contractor. Virtually all medical care subject to review in thePacific area, except for the State of Hawaii, is furnished by the Governmentand no other reviewers are available in the area who can conduct reviewwith complete independence and objectivity. We feel that consolidatingthe areas into one designated PRO review area will enhance the efficiencyand effectiveness of the PRO programs.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Response to Comments</ITAG>Because of the large number of pieces of correspondence we normally receiveon a with opportunity for public comment, notice we are not able to acknowledgeor respond to them individually. We will consider all comments containedin correspondence that we receive by the date specified in the ``<T2>DATE</T2>'' section of this preamble, and will respond to the commentsin the preamble of a revised final notice if we find it necessary to issuea revised notice. <ITAG tagnum="84">V. Regulatory Impact Statement </ITAG>A. Executive Order 12291 Executive Order 12291 (E.O. 12291) requires us to prepare and publish aregulatory impact analysis for any notice that meets one of the E.O. criteriafor a ``major rule''; that is, that would be likely to result in_ andbullet; An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; andbullet; A major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individualindustries, Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographicregions; or andbullet; Significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.This final notice with a comment period combines Hawaii, with AmericanSamoa, Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands as a singlearea for purposes of PRO review. As stated earlier in this notice, the rationale for the change in the reviewarea designation is that there are no known qualified local organizationswho have placed a bid for the PRO contract in the area of American Samoa,Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands area. Each PROcontract for this area has been awarded to the Hawaii PRO as a separateand distinct contract from the one that implements its operations in Hawaii.To maintain the current designation of the Guam, American Samoa, and theCommonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands area as a separate reviewarea presents an administrative burden to the Government and the PRO contractor.Combining the areas presents programmatic advantages which will resultin savings to the contractor. Although we have no way of determining themagnitude of any effect of this notice in advance, we believe there willbe a cost savings because the contractor would be required to submit onlya single bid for the entire area. Under this redesignation, combining these two review areas into a single,more efficient PRO area, we will continue to recognize the unique characteristicsof the beneficiary population and local medical practice. We believe theefficiency and effectiveness of the review programs will be enhanced andthe affected beneficiaries will benefit from the resultant program improvements.This final notice does not meet the $100 million criterion nor do we believethat it meets the other E.O. 12291 criteria. Therefore, a regulatory impactanalysis is not required. <ITAG tagnum="84">B. Regulatory Flexibility Act </ITAG>We generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistentwith the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 through 612) unlessthe Secretary certifies that a notice will not have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of the RFA,all PRO contractors are treated as small entities. In addition, section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to preparea regulatory impact analysis if a notice may have a significant impacton the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. Suchan analysis must conform to the provisions of section 604 of the RFA. Forpurposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural hospitalas a hospital with fewer than 50 beds located outside of a MetropolitanStatistical Area. Because there will be no changes to the character of medical review servicescurrently being provided in the affected areas, there will be no adverseeffect on either the beneficiaries or the health care providers. By easingthe administrative burden on the designated PRO contractor, we believethe contractor's efficiency and effectiveness will be enhanced. For the reasons cited above, we are not preparing a regulatory flexibilityanalysis since we have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that thisnotice will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial  numberof small entities or a significant economic impact on the operations ofa substantial number of small rural hospitals.<ITAG tagnum="20">(Sec. 1153 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1320c-2) Catalogof Federal Domestic Assistance Program No. 13.773, Medicare-Hospital Insurance)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: June 27, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Louis B.
