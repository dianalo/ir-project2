McFarlane said that he was among the White House advisers whourged Reagan to outline the Star Wars plan, formally known as theStrategic Defense Initiative, during a March 1983 speech on defenseissues.   ``The president's speech provoked a firestorm of debate, and inthe five years since then have been marked by bitter, passionateadvocacy and criticism,'' he said.   Initially, McFarlane said, the debate was ``polarized by, on theone hand, the romantic and manipulative hyperbole of theadministration and, on the other, by the flatly dismissive rhetoricof scientists who should have known better.''   In answer to the question, ``can defensive technologies providethe means to defend us against ballistic missile attack?'' saidMcFarlane, ``we do not know and cannot know for the next 10 to 15years.''   Despite the sometimes misguided political debate that followedReagan's Star Wars speech in 1983, said McFarlane, the initiativehelped force the Soviets back to the negotiating table, nudged themtoward 50 percent cuts in strategic arms and may have prompted themto into economic reforms.   McFarlane wrote that ``those of us in the White House whoproposed the Strategic Defense Initiative believe that areorientation of our investment strategy to emphasize an area ofour comparative advantage _ excellence in high technology _ couldpersuade the Soviets that we could outstrip an entire generation ofSoviet military investment.''   ``If we could do so, we could remove their only claim tosuperpower status and perhaps lead them to deal more constructivelywith our concerns about their (strategic rocket) forces,'' he said.   ``The Soviets' commitment to a 50-percent reduction in theirheavy missile launchers and warheads _ a possibility they would notdiscuss seriously until after SDI was proposed _ represents avindication of that strategy,'' wrote McFarlane.   McFarlane, a former Marine Corps officer, resigned from theNational Security Council staff in December 1985 and is now acounselor at the Center for Strategic and International Studies inWashington.   He pleaded guilty in March to four counts of misleading Congressabout the Iran-Contra affair, in which the administration sent armsto Iran in hopes of winning freedom for American hostages inLebanon.</TEXT></DOC>
