Great Lakes states that by order issued April 30, 1970, in Docket No. CP70-19,43 FPC 635 (1970), Great Lakes received a certificate of public convenienceand necessity to provide a natural gas sales service to Natural; that thepresent Sales Service Agreement providing for sales service of up to 171,325Mcf per day was certificated by the Commission's order issued October 21,1981 in Docket No. CP61-241-000, 17 FERC andpara; 61,065 (1981); that thesales service is provided pursuant to Great Lakes' FERC Gas Tariff, FirstRevised Vol. No. 1, Rate Schedule CQ-2 and Sales Service Agreement datedNovember 2, 1981; and that the Sales Service Agreement terminates on November1, 1990. Great Lakes states that, although it has approached Natural regardinglong-term requirements beyond November 1, 1990, Natural has not provideda firm statement of its intention regarding conversion of its sales serviceto transportation. Great Lakes states that it neither produces nor gathers natural gas; thatit purchases Canadian natural gas from TransCanada PipeLines Limited (TransCanada)for resale to Natural; that Natural negotiates the applicable natural gaspricing directly with TransCanada; and that Great Lakes acts as a conduitof that gas from TransCanada to Natural.

Amoco states that it anticipates that the subject gas will be carriedacross the 0.76 mile interval by one or both of the two lines, the ConvertedLine and the New Line, described below.It is stated that the Section 25 Station is presently served by a 10-inchdiameter line which is part of EPNG's San Juan Basin gathering system.Amoco states that EPNG agreed to convey to Amoco a segment of that 10-inchline, namely a segment running from the Section 25 Station to a point onnear proximity to the interconnection. Amoco states that it plans for thatsegment to be converted into a spur feeding gas into EPNG's mainline systemat the interconnection. According to Amoco, the converted segment willbe referred to as the Converted Line. Amoco states that even after conversion,the line segment in question may, on occasion, be used to carry gas toEPNG's San Juan Basin gathering system. Amoco further states that whenthe compression facilities planned for the Section 25 Station are fullyoperational, the Converted Line may carry up to 70 MMcf of natural gasper day (MMcfd).Amoco also states that it intends to construct, own and operate a 16-inchdiameter spur line, the New Line, crossing the 0.76 mile interval and runningparallel to the Converted Line. Amoco further states that when the compressionfacilities planned for the Section 25 Station are fully operational, theNew Line may carry up to 180 MMcfd.Amoco also gives notice that, in the belief that its lines are non-jurisdictionalfacilities, Amoco intends to begin construction of the New Line as earlyas the 31st day following the date on which its petition is received atthe offices of the Commission. In addition, Amoco states that dependingon the availability of interim compression, the work required to changethe pipeline acquired from EPNG into the Converted Line could begin asearly as that 31st day.<T3>Comment date: </T3>December 4, 1989, in accordance with the first subparagraphof Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice.<ITAG tagnum="84">16.
