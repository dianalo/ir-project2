Digital said the device, which uses a laser to read information stored on a shiny 12-inch-diameter platter, can hold two billion characters of information, or as much as about 80 filing cabinets. Digital said information can be written on the platter once but can't be erased, making it useful for archival purposes.    The $30,000 RV20 device works with Digital computers. Scott McReady, an analyst with market researcher CAP International, Marshfield, Mass., said Digital's action &quot;legitimizes a technology that has been unable to gain wide-based acceptance within the data-storage industry.&quot;    Some other computer makers and optical-storage companies have introduced optical-storage products, but the impact of the new device should be stronger because Digital is among the largest and most-successful concerns in the computer industry. </TEXT></DOC>
