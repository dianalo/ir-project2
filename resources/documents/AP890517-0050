The list of disgraced party leaders also grew as the chairman ofthe opposition Komeito, or Clean Government Party, said he wouldresign.   Junya Yano is the third party head to announce his resignationbecause of the scandal, following Prime Minister Norobu Takeshitaas president of the governing Liberal Democrats and SaburoTsukamoto of the Democratic Socialists.   Takeshita remains in office while the Liberal Democrats searchfor a leader and a prime minister who is respected and untainted bythe scandal, which has decimated the top ranks of politicians inJapan.   Takako Doi, head of the opposition Japan Socialist Party, saidthe disruption in Komeito was disappointing at a time she is tryingto hold together an opposition coalition to oust the LiberalDemocrats.   ``I hope Komeito will go ahead and unite with the Socialists,overcoming the latest trials,'' Ms. Doi said.   Prosecutors, meanwhile, summoned two Parliament members forquestioning. They said the lawmakers were suspected of acceptingbribes in return for helping the Recruit Co. in its business ofemployment information.   Prosecutors say the conglomerate sought favors by sellingcut-price stock in a subsidiary to about 160 politicians,bureaucrats and business and media executives.   The buyers earned handsome profits after the shares went on saleto the public in 1986 and the price shot up.   Prosecutors have charged 14 people with violations of briberyand securities laws, but until today all the official suspects inthe scandal were businessmen or civil servants.   Liberal Democrat Takao Fujinami, 56, who served as chief Cabinetsecretary for three years under former Prime Minister YasuhiroNakasone, was ordered to one prosecutor's office, and Komeitolegislator Katsuya Ikeda, 51, was called to another.   By Japanese legal custom, the summoning was equivalent toarrest, but since Parliament is in session the prosecutors couldnot jail the two lawmakers without permission of the Parliament.   Fujinami plans to resign his seat in the House ofRepresentatives, Kyodo news service reported. He is suspected ofhelping Recruit in employment advertising and giving other favorsin exchange for a profit of about $190,000 in a share transactionhandled by his secretary.   Ikeda announced Tuesday that he would resign his Parliament seatto atone for ``causing troubles'' to his Buddhist-affiliated party,which is almost as deeply troubled by the Recruit scandal as theLiberal Democrats.   Ikeda had no power as an opposition legislator but prosecutorssay he repeatedly brought issues before Parliament to benefitRecruit.   Ikeda's brother, Yuzuru, earned about $73,500 on Recruit sharetransactions, and reports say 70 percent of the profit went intoIkeda's own bank account.   Fujinami and Ikeda also received large donations from Recruit.   Komeito leaders met after the lawmakers were summoned andChairman Yano later told reporters that he believed Ikeda'sstatement that he was innocent of wrongdoing.   But the Komeito chairman said public trust in the party had beenimpaired.   ``I apologize from my heart and, taking this situation seriouslyand realizing my own resposibility, I resign the chairmanship,''Yano said.</TEXT></DOC>
