House Speaker Thomas P. Foley called Bush's plan for U.S.-Sovietreductions ``a good first step'' but said it does not answer thequestion of how to control chemical weapons production by othercountries.   Shevardnadze, in a United Nations speech today, said Moscow willjoin the United States and ``radically reduce or completelydestroy'' all its chemical weapons stockpiles.   He also challenged Bush to join the Soviet Union in stoppingproduction of all chemical weapons, halting nuclear tests andstopping the manufacture of weapons-grade plutonium and uranium.   At the White House, Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater saidShevardnadze's response ``shows that we are on the same wavelength.It was a very constructive response. Our ultimate objective istotal elimination of chemical weapons. And it appears that bothnations are now ready to act.''   Foley said after a meeting of congressional leaders with Bush,``something we're concerned about trying to bring about isparticipation of third countries and countries that have apotential but not yet a significant production.''   Administration officials contend agreement on chemical weaponsreduction by the United States and Soviet Union could also spur thesmaller countries to sign a ban.   ``These are steps in the right direction,'' Foley said of Bush'splan. ``I don't think many of us feel that all the potential hasbeen explored yet and we'd like to urge the president forward, butcertainly these are positive steps.''   He said Shevardnadze's proposal for a complete abolition ofchemical weapons by the two superpowers, apparently regardless ofwhen or whether the smaller countries sign on to a treaty, ``seemslike an issue worth discussion.''   ``We welcome the proposal concerning chemical weapons putforward yesterday by President Bush,'' Shevardnadze said.``Generally consistent with the well-known initiatives of theSoviet leadership, it indicates to us that we share the desire torid mankind of those barbaric weapons.''   Bush returned Monday night from New York after outlining beforethe United Nations his offer of an 80 percent cut in U.S. chemicalweapons stockpiles.   The proposal, designed to spur a 40-nation conference in Genevato ban all chemical weapons within 10 years, would have the twosuperpowers reduce their stockpiles to a level equivalent to 20percent of the current U.S. level. That would mean deeper cuts forthe Soviets, because U.S. officials contend Moscow has far greaterstockpiles than the United States _ an acknowledged 50,000 tonscompared to an estimated 30,000 tons for the United States.   Bush proposed a U.S.-Soviet agreement to begin those cuts atonce, while a 40-nation treaty is being worked out in which theUnited States would destroy 98 percent of its chemical weapons overeight years if the Soviets joined the ban.   The remaining 2 percent would be destroyed within 10 years ifall nations capable of building such weapons agreed to a total ban.   While only the United States and Soviet Union acknowledge havingchemical weaponry, Bush said more than 20 nations have such weaponsor the capability to produce them.   Baker told reporters the smaller countries would be persuaded tojoin the ban because: ``I think you bring the force of publicopinion to bear worldwide on any country that says that they'regoing to keep them and they're going to use them.''   Baker and Bush's national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft,said the United States would consider imposing economic sanctionsagainst nations that refused to sign on to a treaty ban.   The United States has condemned Iran and Iraq for using suchweapons and said Libya was on the verge of production. Someofficials suspect Syria has a chemical weapons program.   ``These horrible weapons are now finding their way into regionalconflicts,'' Bush said in his speech. ``This is unacceptable.''   Bush's proposal came after two days of talks betweenShevardnadze and Baker that produced agreement to hold a superpowersummit next spring or summer. The two sides also agreed to exchangeinformation about U.S. and Soviet chemical weapons and conductcross-inspections of arsenals.   Bush in his speech heralded ``signs of a new attitude thatprevails between the U.S. and U.S.S.R.''   ``Serious differences remain but the willingness to dealconstructively and candidly with those differences is news that weand indeed the world must welcome,'' he said.   The president said ``a new world of freedom'' is emerging aroundthe globe.   ``Today we are witnessing an ideological collapse, the demise ofthe totalitarian idea of the omniscient, all-powerful state,'' hesaid.   Twice, as vice president, Bush blocked legislation to destroyU.S. chemical weapons by breaking a tie vote in Congress. But thosewould have been unilateral reductions, not tied to Sovietcompliance.   During his first trip to the United Nations as president, Bushalso met separately Monday with the presidents of Brazil,Guatemala, Bolivia and Venezuela and Israeli Deputy Prime MinisterShimon Peres and Foreign Minister Moshe Ahrens, then hosted areception and dinner for diplomats and heads of state.</TEXT></DOC>
