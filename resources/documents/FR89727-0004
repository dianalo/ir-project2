Section 101(5) of the FCU Act (12 U.S.C. 1752(5)) defines ``memberaccount'' to include the accounts of nonmember credit unions and the accountsof nonmember units of Federal, state, or local governments and the politicalsubdivisions of such units. The term also includes, but only in the caseof a credit union that serves predominatly low-income members and has receiveda low-income designation from NCUA, accounts of any nonmember. The terms``predominantly'' and ``low-income member'' are currently defined in Section700.1 of NCUA's Regulations (12 CFR 700.1). Concurrent with this finalrule, the NCUA is issuing a proposed amendment adding a new andSection; 701.32(d)to clarify that FCU's must obtain a designation from NCUA prior to acceptingnonmember shares pursuant to the low-income authority, and that federally-insuredstate-chartered credit unions (FISCU's) must receive such a designationfrom the appropriate state regulator with the concurrence of NCUA. TheNCUA is also proposing to move the definitions of ``predominantly'' and``low-income members'' to andSection; 701.32(d).On December 19, 1988, the NCUA Board published an interim final rule limitingto 20% of total shares the amount of public unit and nonmember accountsthat may be maintained by FCU's and FISCU's without prior NCUA approval.(<T3>See </T3>53 FR 50918.) Although the interim final rule was made immediatelyeffective, the NCUA Board provided a 60-day comment period. The commentperiod was later extended for approximately 90 days to May 15, 1989. (<T3>See </T3>54 FR 8280 2/28/89.)<ITAG tagnum="84">Comments</ITAG>One hundred and twenty-six comments were received. Fifty of the commenterswere FCU's and nine were state-chartered credit unions. Thirty-nine ofthe commenters were community and religious organizations. Nine commenterswere state credit union leagues. Five comments were from national creditunion trade associations, and four commenters were other types of tradeassociations. Four of the commenters were state credit union regulators.Comments were also received from a local association of credit unions,a Congressman, and a county treasurer. Three comments were from individuals.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion  </ITAG>The reaction of many of the commenters was that the rule was an overreactionto the potential losses to the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund(NCUSIF) associated with the 1988 failure of the Franklin Community FCU.Commenters stated that other credit unions should not be penalized forthe actions of one credit union. Some commenters believed that NCUA shouldnot have made the rule immediately effective, that is, without a priorcomment period. The reasons for the immediate action were set forth inthe preamble to the interim rule.  Franklin Community FCU was only one of several cases involving the misuseof credit union, public unit, and other nonmember funds. The preamble tothe interim final rule listed six credit unions other than Franklin wherethe misuse of such funds has resulted in losses to the NCUSIF. The interimfinal rule is not intended to penalize credit unions, but to ensure thatnonmember and public unit shares are accepted and utilized by credit unionsin a safe and sound manner and to further the interest of serving members.The commenters' belief that misuse of such funds is not a pervasive problemfor credit unions is correct. It is, however, a costly problem when itoccurs, and one that affects all federally-insured credit unions in twoways: Through losses to the NCUSIF, and loss in confidence in credit unionswhen public units and nonmembers suffer losses because their accounts arein excess of the share insurance limit.  The majority of the commenters objected to the interim final rule, statingthat it was unduly harsh on community development and low-income creditunions. Many of these commenters were low-income designated and/or communitydevelopment credit unions, and community and religious organizations thathave accounts in these credit unions. The credit union commenters statedthat the rule would affect their ability to make loans and may jeopardizetheir existence. The organizational commenters stated that they generallyhave accounts that earn below market rates in low-income credit unionsto provide a source of funds for the poor and minorities, and that therule would limit their altruistic goal.   The rule is not a prohibition on public unit and nonmember shares. AllFCU's may continue to accept other credit union and public unit shares.FCU's with a low-income designation from NCUA may continue to accept nonmembershares. FISCU's may accept public unit, credit union, and nonmember sharesto the extent permitted under the appropriate state law. The rule does,however, require federally-insured credit unions that wish to accept suchshares in excess of 20 percent of total shares to submit to NCUA a reasonableplan setting forth the intended use of the funds and obtain NCUA approval. The rule requires that a federally-insured credit union's plan describehow public unit and nonmember funds will be used to serve the credit union'smembership, i.e., by providing loanable funds to its members or throughincreased earnings; provide for matching maturities of public unit andnonmember shares with corresponding assets, or a justification for anymismatch; and provide for an adequate income spread between public unitand nonmember shares and corresponding assets. The rule further requiresthat a credit union submit its loan and investment policies and its latestfinancial statements to NCUA. These requirements should ensure that federally-insuredcredit unions have a reasonable plan in place for use of the funds. NCUA'sRegional Offices will review the documentation submitted by a credit unionfrom a safety and soundness perspective, including a review of asset-liabilitymanagement and the nature of the proposed investments.  One of the primary objections to the interim final rule was that it appliedto public unit, credit union, and nonmember shares earning below-marketrates. Several commenters also objected to the rule's application to publicunit shares and shares from other credit unions in general, and to theacceptance of public unit and nonmember shares by small credit unions.Other commenters objecting to the rule stated that it interferes with theCongressional intent of allowing designated low-income credit unions toaccept nonmember shares as set forth in the FCU Act. Again, it should bestressed that the purpose of the rule is not to prohibit nonmember andpublic unit shares, but to ensure that such funds are used in a safe andsound manner and are utilized in the best interests of the membership. The FCU must have a reasonable plan in place for the funds. The fact thatnonmember and public unit shares are to be paid below-market rates doesnot alleviate the need for a plan for use of such funds, nor does the sourceof the funds or the size of the credit union accepting the funds. The riskof misuse of the funds is the same in each case. To exempt certain typesof accounts or certain credit unions from the rule's coverage would beto suggest that a plan for the use of the funds is not necessary in theseinstances. This is not the case.  In a similar vein, several commenters requested that NCUA not adopt a finalrule, but instead limit or prohibit the payment of commissions on the saleof market-rate share certificates. The rule is not directed at the methodby which the credit unions obtain funds. The concern is with credit unionstaking in large amounts of public unit and nonmember shares without a planfor their use. Acceptance of these funds can occur with or without theassistance of a broker. Other commenters suggested an abandonment of therule until NCUA completes a comprehensive study of the rule's effect onlow-income and community development credit unions. The Board does notbelieve this to be the proper approach since these credit unions can obtainan exemption to the 20% limitation.  One of the commenters suggested that NCUA require federally-insured creditunions to report nonmember shares to NCUA. This information is currentlycollected on FISCU's. NCUA intends to begin collecting this informationon FCU's in December of 1989.<ITAG tagnum="84">State Regulators</ITAG>Three of the commenters, including two state regulators, believe that therule interferes with the states' authority to regulate FISCU's. In thepreamble to the interim final rule, the NCUA Board discussed the applicabilityof the rule to all federally-insured credit unions. The Board explainedthat it was necessary to include FISCU's since their acceptance of publicunit and nonmember shares has the same effect on the NCUSIF as those acceptedby FCU's, and therefore should be subject to the same requirements as FCU's.The Board noted further that the rule did not impose any additional costsor burdens on the states, nor did it affect the states' ability to dischargetraditional state government functions. This continues to be the Board'sposition with respect to the final rule.Since the Board believes the applicability of the rule to FISCU's is necessary,state involvement with the rule is provided. The final rule specificallyrequires concurrence by the state regulator for a FISCU to obtain a waiverfrom the 20% limitation.<ITAG tagnum="84">CPA Audit Requirement</ITAG>The interim final rule included a request for comment on the issue of whetherall federally-insured credit unions that accept nonmember accounts shouldbe required to obtain annual CPA audits and disclose the audits to thenonmember accountholders. A majority of the commenters objected to sucha requirement. The NCUA Board has determined not to impose the requirementat this time. Legislation currently being considered by Congress wouldprovide that NCUA require a CPA audit where the supervisory committee'saudit is not performed, is inadequate, or where the credit union's recordkeepingis deficient. In light of the Congressional initiative on this issue andthe comments received, the Board will not, at this time, impose a separateCPA audit requirement for credit unions accepting nonmember shares.<ITAG tagnum="84">Changes Made to the Interim Final Rule</ITAG>Section 701.32 Payments on Shares by Public Units and NonmembersThe final rule includes the procedures that a Federal credit union seekingan exemption from the 20 percent limitation should follow, and furtherestablishes the standards and guidelines that will be followed by the NCUARegional Offices upon receipt of an exemption request. An exemption requestwill be acted upon by the Regional Office within 30 days after all necessaryinformation is received from the applicant credit union. Credit unionsmay appeal an exemption denial to the NCUA Board through the Regional Director.Normally, an exemption will be granted for a two-year period. If a creditunion has accepted nonmember funds pursuant to an exemption and the exemptionperiod ends and is not renewed, nonmembers shares in excess of the 20%in the credit union will continue to be covered by the NCUSIF within applicableinsurance limits. No new nonmember shares can be accepted. Nonmember sharecertificates in excess of the 20% will remain insured until maturity. Theycannot be renewed. This information is contained in andSection; 701.32(b)of the final rule.Section 741.5 Maximum Public Unit and Nonmember AccountsThe final rule sets forth the procedure that will be followed when a FISCUseeks an exemption from the 20% limitation. The rule provides that therequest should be submitted to NCUA in accordance with andSection; 701.32,but will only be granted by NCUA if the appropriate state regulator concurswith the approval.<ITAG tagnum="84">Effective Date</ITAG>The Board believes that it is consistent with its responsibilities andin the best interests of the credit unions affected by this rule to makethe rule immediately effective. The rule sets forth procedures a creditunion is to follow to obtain an exemption from the 20% limitation, andimposes certain requirements on the Regional Directors when acting on theserequests. The procedures will provide credit unions with the assurancethat their requests are being treated uniformly. The rule further providescredit unions the right to appeal an adverse exemption decision to theNCUA Board. Only minor changes have been made to the substantive provisionscontained in the interim final rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Procedures</ITAG>Regulatory Flexibility ActThis final rule impose a limitation on the amount of funds that a federally-insuredcredit union may accept in the form of public unit and nonmember accounts.However, the rule also provides a method for obtaining an exemption fromthe limitation upon a showing of need and ability to manage the funds inthese accounts. For that reason, the NCUA Board certifies that this rulewill not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number ofsmall credit unions (those under $1 million in asset size). Therefore,a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required.Paperwork Reduction ActThe rule contains one paperwork requirement: any credit union requestingan exemption from the 20% limitation must submit an explanation of theneed to raise the limit, a plan for use of the funds, and copies of itslending and investment policies and its latest financial statements. TheOffice of Management and Budget has approved this paperwork requirement(OMB NO. 3133-0114, approved for use through 4/30/92).Executive Order 12612The rule applies to federally-insured state-chartered credit unions thataccept public unit and nonmember accounts. The acts and practices subjectto the rule have implications for the entire federally-insured credit unionsystem and the NCUSIF, and are not unique to only one type of charter.The final rule provides for state involvement in the decision to granta waiver from the 20% limitation for FISCU's.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 701</ITAG>Credit unions, public units, nonmember accounts.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 741</ITAG>Credit unions, Public units, Nonmember accounts.<ITAG tagnum="21">By the National Credit Union Administration Board on July 20, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Becky Baker, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Secretary of the Board.</ITAG>Accordingly, NCUA amends its regulations as follows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 701_ORGANIZATION AND OPERATION OF FEDERAL CREDIT UNIONS</ITAG>1.
