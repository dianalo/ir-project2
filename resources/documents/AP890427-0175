The crowd began gathering at dawn at Ongwediva Lutheran missionstation, where 31 guerillas spent the night after greeting streamsof Namibian peasants who came to see them and participate in achurch service.   Most black schools in the area around the garrison town ofOshakati were closed Thursday as the students marched.   U.N. police monitors watched the procession, which grew largeras it progressed. South-West African police were barely visible,and army patrols were non-existent. The South African-controlledmilitary was restricted to base from Wednesday to Saturday to allowthe estimated 600 guerrillas in the territory a safe route to theborder.   The South-West African People's Organization guerrillasendangered a U.N. independence plan for Namibia when they crossedthe border from Angola on April 1. Under the plan, they were towait in their Angolan bases until mid-May when they were to return,unarmed, as refugees to take part in November elections.   South African-controlled military forces, which had beenconfined to base in accordance with the plan, were released tofight the SWAPO incursion. According to NamibiaAdministrator-General Louis Pienaar, the battles caused the deathsof 305 infiltrators and 27 security force members.   The United Nations said Thursday at Windhoek, the territorialcapital, that 3,941 military personnel from 21 countries aredeployed in Namibia to help monitor the transition to independence.   The South African military on Wednesday turned over to theUnited Nations 31 guerrillas captured in the fighting.   At midday Thursday, 28 of them walked across the border atRuacana and got into trucks to carry them to their bases 100 milesto the north, a territorial official said. Three injured fighterswere taken elsewhere to recuperate.   The United Nations is supervising a transition period andelections aimed at ending South Africa's 74-year rule over Namibia.   The independence plan is tied to a southern Africa peaceagreement that provides for withdrawal of South African and Cubanforces from Angola.   American, Soviet, Angolan, Cuban and South African delegationsmet Thursday in Cape Town, South Africa, to discuss developments.   ``This is perhaps the most serious meeting the joint commissionhas faced so far,'' South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha saidin welcoming the delegates. `` Since we last met ... in Namibia wetried our best, all of us, to deal with the serious problem thathas arisen as a result of SWPAO's incursion and violations.''   The meeting represents the first time in decades that Soviets,Angolans and Cubans have made an official visit to South Africa,since relations were broken over the country's laws of apartheid _racial separation.   Bishop Cleopas Dumeni, the head of the Evangelical LutheranChurch in Namibia who conducted church services at the Ongwedivamission Wednesday evening and Thursday morning, suffered the lossof a son killed by security forces and a daughter killed by a bombexplosion blamed on SWAPO during the 23-year bush war.   He told the SWAPO fighters, ``They (the villagers) have come tosee you and admire you. The coming of the group here shows thatthey appreciate your great sacrifice.''   Some of the guerrillas greeted family members they had not seenfor five to 13 years.</TEXT></DOC>
