But what might be bad for oil refiners could be good for oil consumers.    Although the big London brokerage firm's study doesn't make that point explicitly, the results suggest that increased competition in the refining and marketing sector, or &quot;downstream,&quot; could hold fuel prices down even if crude oil costs rise. &quot;Refining margins are expected to remain low over the next five years,&quot; Geoffrey S. Pyne, a Phillips andamp; Drew oil-market analyst and one of the authors of the study, said in an interview.    OPEC's downstream push does have attractions. For exporters scrambling to sell crude in a world awash with oil, the refining investments can provide &quot;captive&quot; markets. And for refiners coping with surplus refining capacity world-wide, the ventures promise additional financing, fuller use of their facilities, and assured supplies of competitively priced crude.    So far, the downstream leaders are Venezuela and Kuwait, but other OPEC countries, including kingpin Saudi Arabia, now are seeking overseas refining and marketing assets.    Several U.S. consulting firms -- including Cambridge Energy Research Associates, Petroleum Finance Co., and Bonner andamp; Moore Market Consultants -- have suggested the trend marks the &quot;re-integration&quot; of the industry. Major oil companies controlled the bulk of the world's petroleum from well-head to service-station pump until OPEC governments nationalized their oil in the 1970s.    According to the Phillips andamp; Drew study, the return to integration via OPEC will be &quot;painful&quot; for the industry and risky for oil companies. &quot;Downstream earnings will no longer behave counter-cyclically to upstream, and OPEC unity will be undermined with consequent risk to the crude price,&quot; it says.    Also, the study notes, the OPEC nations' refining involvement will &quot;delay the hoped-for recovery in downstream profitability as there will be no economic incentive to close surplus capacity.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
