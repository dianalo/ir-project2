The water media close to neutrality is favourable forthe percipitation of uranium. Neutralization is a key factor settingoff all reactions leading to the precipitation of uranium. The processof reduction precipitation of uranium caused by the neutralization iscalled neutralizing reduction. The reduction-precipitation of uraniumoccurs under the condition of (E/sub W//sup U/ = Eh/sub W/ - Eh/sub o//supU/). Not only the reduction-precipitation of uranium depends on the decreaseof Eh/sub W/, but also is related to the increasing or decreasing rateof Eh/sub o//sup U/. By means of thermodynamic calculations and diagramsthis paper shows that though the reducer has not increased, the Eh/subW//sup U/ will also be realized, when acid and alkali uranium-bearingsolutions are neutralized. The strong reducer is not found in the graniteuranium deposits, and during the process of rising thermal water upwardfrom the depth, the increase of the reducing capacity of thermal wateris difficult. In this case, the neutralizing reduction will be very important.This is a new clue to the study of uranium metallogenetic mechanism andformation conditions of rich uranium ores.</TEXT></DOC>
