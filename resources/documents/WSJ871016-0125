This week's turmoil, especially in the bond market, could threaten the surprisingly robust economic performance. Despite the disappointing August trade figures, manufacturers continue to report that increased exports are helping their business. Unemployment is at its lowest level in nearly eight years; consumer spending hasn't slumped badly.    But those very signs of strength add to market uneasiness. Some analysts fear the economy may be overheating, raising the risks of inflation and still higher interest rates. Prospects for a further decline in the dollar -- widely predicted by private economists -- magnify those fears.    &quot;We've had little in the way of inflation,&quot; says an administration official. &quot;But you'd have to be asleep not to notice what's happened with interest rates. It's a little scary.&quot;    HARD-LINERS FEAR fallout from Arias's Nobel Peace Prize.    They say the Costa Rican's award gives him a vested interest in keeping the Central American peace process going next month even if Nicaragua fails to show progress toward liberalization. &quot;Psychologically, he'll now have to declare anything a success to justify the prize,&quot; says GOP Rep. Gingrich.    The main fear is that he and the other Central America leaders may decide to extend the Nov. 7 deadline for a regionwide amnesty, cease-fire and the beginning of democratization. That could fuel arguments in Congress to delay Reagan's Contra aid package still further, a delay the administration claims would cripple the rebels.    WALSH FACES continued battles at home and abroad.    Members of the Iran-Contra prosecutor's staff express agitation at the CIA's slow pace in turning over documents. The agency says to protect secrets it must move cautiously, but prosecutors also suggest that previous testimony by some CIA officials may have been intended to mislead investigators.    Israel has so far failed to deliver on even the limited cooperation it promised; U.S. courts ultimately are expected to order Israelis to answer at least a few written questions. In Switzerland, appeals and procedural motions prevent access to bank records despite the government's promises of help.    North privately tells friends he doesn't expect to be charged until well into 1988, at the height of the election campaigns.    PARTY PALS? The Republican senatorial committee chides PACs for giving too little despite the GOP's &quot;hard work&quot; blocking a campaign-finance bill. &quot;Frankly, a lot of Republican senators are upset,&quot; a party mailing says. But the GOP remains &quot;committed to doing what it takes to improve our relations with the PAC community.&quot;    BENNETT PLAYS the field of GOP presidential candidates. The Education secretary spent an hour with Dole last week, ate breakfast with Bush two days later, met with du Pont in North Carolina and sees Kemp socially. His stress on moral values keeps him in demand for party fund-raisers as well. His activities could further his own possible political ambitions.    STINGER STING? U.S. military officials express limited concern at recent evidence that Stinger anti-aircraft missiles have fallen into Soviet and Iranian hands. The reason: The Soviets got enough data to copy the missile from a spy operation involving the Greek army several years ago. U.S. officials say the latest version of the missile hasn't been compromised.    BAKER'S GOLD GAMBIT -- using gold to help guide international economic policies -- might have been proposed 18 months earlier but for opposition from Shultz. The Treasury chief had originally considered the idea as part of his effort last year to coordinate international economic policy. Shultz was Treasury secretary when the gold standard was abandoned under Nixon.    BURNLEY FACES Capitol Hill battles before and after confirmation.    Reagan's nominee for Transportation secretary, likely to be confirmed despite expected rough handling from senators, may plunge into new battles almost immediately. The administration threatens to veto a House-passed measure requiring airlines to give passengers free tickets if their bags are more than two hours late.    It also staunchly opposes efforts to protect airline employees hurt by mergers and to rehire some fired controllers. And Burnley is expected to fight Senate Aviation Chairman Ford's plan to make the FAA independent of Transportation Department political control.    Burnley must also untangle compromise talks on airline noise, talks deemed crucial to building new airports.    MINOR MEMOS: Mix that metaphor! Sen. Warner claims invocation of the War Powers Act would put U.S. forces in a &quot;byzantine thicket of quicksand.&quot; . . . A new bumper sticker reads: &quot;Simon -- By Default.&quot; . . . Former Sen. McGovern is the newest TV pitchman for Bic disposable razors; he says their shave is smoother than his campaigns ever were. . . . Mortgage-banker terrorism? HUD undersecretary Covitz refuses a planned news briefing at the mortgage bankers' conference because of a &quot;lack of complete security.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
