Early last month, U.S. investors such as Rockefeller Foundation and Equitable Capital Management Corp. plowed $225 million into Advent Corp.'s International Network Fund. The fund will invest in 15 countries outside the U.S.    And in the past 12 months, others including Alan Patricof Associates, Hambro International Venture Fund, Vista Ventures and Orange Nassau International have raised more than $750 million from U.S. and foreign investors for global deals.    Advent plans to invest through 16 venture capital concerns in Britain, continental Europe and Asia. In the aftermath of the October stock market crash, &quot;opportunities abroad are better than in the U.S.,&quot; says Peter Brooke, the 58-year-old chairman of Advent. &quot;We are seeing more established companies with lower valuations,&quot; he explains.    Advent also wants to finance spin-offs and management buy-outs. &quot;There's a whole generation of postwar entrepreneurs who want to cash out. That itself is going to create new opportunities,&quot; Mr. Brooke says.    Not everyone is convinced that global is better. &quot;I'm not sure that venture capital outside of the U.S. is any more profitable,&quot; says Ivan Momtchiloff, chairman of 3i Corp., one of the largest Britain-based venture concerns. &quot;There's little evidence to suggest that a computer retailer in France or the U.K. is going to be more profitable&quot; than an American one, he maintains.    But most new funds believe it's worth including ventures in Western Europe and Southeast Asia, as well as their traditional U.S. investments.    A typical global deal is a $12 million investment by Advent and Orange Nassau in Paris-based Edap S.A. The company, which makes machines to electronically crush kidney stones, was discovered by the Singapore affiliate of Advent. Edap is being assisted in international marketing by both venture firms.    Global deal makers predict their non-U.S. investments will prove more profitable than recent U.S. returns. Alan Patricof Associates' first European fund, for example, has had 30% annual growth, reports Ronald Cohen, the fund's London-based chairman. His portfolio, which consists of mostly mature companies and a small portion of high-technology concerns, wasn't deeply hurt in the recent weak market, Mr. Cohen says.    Jack Meyer, chief investment officer for the Rockefeller Foundation, says: &quot;We wouldn't have invested in such a fund if conditions for venture investing hadn't improved significantly,&quot; he adds.    Mr. Meyer and other investors say they are encouraged by the improving climate for entrepreneurship, helped by lower corporate and individual tax rates in Britain and West Germany. The rapid growth of small companies in the over-the-counter markets in France and Britain is also promising, the investors say.    Investing in funds like Advent &quot;enhances our knowledge of international markets,&quot; says Frank Savage, vice chairman of Equitable Capital Management.    Japan, however, has been a tough market for venture capitalists to crack. Venture capitalists say a Jafco-Nomura venture fund has found few attractive Japanese companies to invest in, and those it has identified prefer debt investors to the traditional equity approach of venture capitalists. Jafco officials weren't available for comment.    Hampering such funds are Japanese laws that restrict venture capitalists' stakes in any given deal and prevent them from sitting on a company's board, a venture capitalist familiar with Jafco said. Most of Jafco's $700 million of venture capital is in mature companies or in the form of debt financing.    Still, investing internationally in venture capital can provide access to new products, some U.S. corporations say. Providing capital for start-ups and early-stage companies abroad often leads to joint ventures and licensing agreements, says David Caldwell, a vice president for Monsanto Corp., which has invested more than $50 million in global venture funds.    ---            New Venture Funds That Invest Globally                                       (In millions                                        of dollars)            Advest                         $225            Alan Patricof Associates        200            Hambrecht andamp; Quist               200            Bain Venture Capital            105            Hambro International             88            Orange Nassau                    86            Vista Group                      75            Grace                            31   NOTE: All funds raised in the last 12 months</TEXT></DOC>
