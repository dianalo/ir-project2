Its valedictorian is premier leveraged-buyout firm KohlbergKravis Roberts andamp; Co., which pulled off the coup of the year in lateNovember: the mammoth $24.5 billion leveraged buyout of RJR NabiscoInc. That deal eclipsed all previous corporate takeovers.   Here are the top members of the class:   _MOST AGGRESSIVE: Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, taking top honors forthe Nabisco deal after a battle royal against the company'smanagement and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.   Earlier in the year, KKR continued its acquisitive efforts at anunrelenting pace with LBOs of battery maker Duracell Inc. for $1.8billion and grocery chain Stop andamp; Shop Cos. for $1.2 billion.   Principal Henry Kravis says he lost eight pounds in five weeksfrom sweating out the Nabisco negotiations. He must have passed upthe Oreos.   _GREATEST CHUTZPAH: Carl Icahn, the owner and chairman of TransWorld Airlines Inc., which he took private in early September.   Undaunted by the failure of his earlier $14.5 billion offer foroil giant Texaco Inc., the wily corporate raider disclosed Dec. 13that he had increased his stock ownership to 15.8 percent ofTexaco's outstanding shares.   The disclosure by Icahn, Texaco's largest shareholder, stoked thesmoldering takeover speculation about the company and boosted itsstock price. _MOST PERSUASIVE: Coniston Partners, masters of``strategic block'' investing.   The trio has bought into huge companies like Allegis Corp. (nowcalled UAL Corp.) and Gillette Co. and amassed a hoard of cash,instead of walking away with the companies themselves.   The partners _ Paul Tierney Jr., Augustus Oliver and KeithGollust _ hardly fit the mold of corporate raiders. They're reallypersuaders: It's the promise of a handsome return, which hasaveraged more than 35 percent a year, that attracts people willingto invest $5 million each to join their funds.   _MOST COSMOPOLITAN: Asher Edelman, who became an American raiderin Paris this year.   With profitable runs on major companies like Lucky Stores Inc.and Fruehauf Corp. under his belt, Edelman has transplanted part ofhis investment business to Europe.   Frustrated by the high prices of U.S. companies and the legalroadblocks that impede the swift stroke of the raider's hand,Edelman plans to camps for at least six months a year in hiscomputer-equipped Paris apartment and work through a holding company.   _MOST GLITZY: Donald Trump, the real estate and casino tycoon whostretched his wings by agreeing in October to buy Eastern Airlines'profitable shuttle service for a cool $365 million in cash.   The irrepressible billionaire recently initiated his fourth forayagainst a Nevada gaming giant, after vowing he would become a majorplayer in Las Vegas. Already the kingpin in rival Atlantic City,N.J., Trump added Caesars World Inc. to his list of Nevada targets.   Trump's latest grand design: he's talking about cashing in onglasnost by building hotels in the Soviet Union.   _MOST BRASH: Media mogul Rupert Murdoch, who acquired TrianglePublications in August for around $3 billion.   As part of the Triangle deal, Murdoch got the powerhouse TVGuide, the most widely read magazine in the nation with acirculation of around 17 million.   The Aussie-turned-U.S.-citizen also broadened his empire duringthe year by creating joint ventures with Walt Disney Co. and a groupof big U.S. hotel chains.   _MOST PERSISTENT: British publishing tycoon Robert Maxwell, theother media member of the class, who tried and tried again to buyMacmillan Inc.   The intrepid Maxwell finally succeeded on the third try, gettingthe venerable publishing and information services giant for $2.5billion in early November. Since then, he's been busy selling offseveral Macmillan subsidiaries.   _MOST CONTRITE: Miami industrialist Victor Posner, who paid a $7million fine (including $3 million to aid the homeless), in a taxevasion case in February.   Posner also has been accused by the Securities and ExchangeCommission of participating in an illegal stock-parking scheme withjunk bond firm Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and fallen speculatorIvan Boesky.   _MOST UNORTHODOX: Stephen Mernick, a 34-year-old Toronto realestate developer and Orthodox Jew who recently acquired the assetsof Jim and Tammy Bakker's bankrupt PTL Ministries for $65 million.   Mernick gets 2,200 acres of property, a 500-room hotel, theHeritage USA Christian theme park, a TV studio and a 2,000-seatchurch. The assets had been appraised before the sale at between $92million and $110 million.   When he entered the PTL bidding in October, Mernick said he wasinterested in the assets ``purely as a real estate deal.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Yearend Editions</NOTE></DOC>
