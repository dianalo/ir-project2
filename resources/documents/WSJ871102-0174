Science has already submitted its verdict. I don't mean Canadian science alone, but European and independent American science as well. That verdict is clear: Sulfur-dioxide emissions lead to acid rain, which in turn can cause severe environmental damage. President Reagan himself has recognized that acid rain is a serious transboundary problem. Canada already has acted by putting into place in 1985 a national acid-rain-control program.    The executive summary of the NAPAP report is misleading because it gives the impression that acid rain is not a problem. It ignores, for example, that: (a) forest declines associated with air pollution, including acid rain, have increased in the past five years in parts of the Northern and Southeastern U.S. in addition to the traditionally affected U.S. Northeast, portions of Canada and Europe; (b) the human health effects of acid rain have been documented through increased hospital admissions during pollution events, i.e., at times when there is a combination of hot weather and high sulfur-dioxide and ozone levels at lower altitudes; (c) damage to building materials is accelerated by air pollution, and (d) 14,000 lakes in Canada are now acidified and 150,000 others show biological and chemical damage.    The Canadian environment and natural resources are being harmed by acid rain, which has its origin in both Canada and the U.S. Canada has put in place a major program to deal with its own domestic sources of sulfur-dioxide emissions: Allowable emissions will be cut by 50% by 1994 in a program that will, incidentally, substantially reduce the flow of Canadian origin SO2 into the Northeastern U.S. (In addition, Canada has adopted tougher nitrogen-oxide emission standards involving state-of-the-art technology for automobiles and trucks. These actions will reduce NOx emissions from mobile sources in Canada by up to 45% by the year 2000.)    Half of Canada's acid-rain problem originates in the U.S. The need for bilateral cooperation to cut the transboundary flow of SO2 emissions was recognized by the U.S. in its recent air-pollution agreement with Mexico. This agreement also reaffirmed Principle 21 of the 1972 Stockholm Declaration, namely that nations ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control not cause damage to the environment of other nations.    Your editorial claims massive budgetary savings by rejecting acid-rain regulations. I disagree. The longer you tarry the higher the cost, financially, environmentally and in terms of human health. Nor is lake liming an effective alternative -- there are too many lakes to make this technique logistically feasible and the costs of repeated treatments, particularly in the absence of emissions controls and reductions, would soar.    Acid rain is an extremely serious transboundary problem. We know the causes. We know the solutions. The international obligations are clear. Our two countries have a long and proud tradition of working together to deal with shared environmental problems. It is time that we made real progress on acid rain.
