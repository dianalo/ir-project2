Nicholas Jr., the formerco-chief executive officer, alleging that his resignationcomes at too high a price in company assets.   In the lawsuit, filed in Delaware Chancery Court, theshareholders alleged that any extraordinary dispersements toMr. Nicholas without something from him in return &quot;wouldconstitute a gift and waste of Time Warner's assets.&quot; Citingreports that he could collect $24 million to $44.5 million invarious forms of compensation, the shareholders asked thecourt to scuttle such payouts.</LP><TEXT>   A Time Warner spokesman dismissed the suit as baseless andsaid the company is confident it will prevail.   Mr. Nicholas resigned as co-chief executive officer almosttwo weeks ago amid bitter strategic differences with, amongothers, Steven J. Ross, chairman and co-chief executiveofficer, and Gerald M. Levin, who succeeded Mr. Nicholas.Associates of the three have characterized Mr. Nicholas'sdeparture as an ouster, though he formally resigned.   The shareholders said that Mr. Nicholas's departure wasofficially called a &quot;voluntary resignation.&quot; Under thatcircumstance, they argued, his employment contract calls forhim to be paid only what he had already earned.   Named in the lawsuit, which was filed last week, wereMessrs. Ross, Nicholas and Levin and other top Time Warnerofficers and directors.</TEXT></DOC>
