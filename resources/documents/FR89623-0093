On May 3, 1974, notice was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (39 FR 15394) of the approval of the WyomingPlan and adoption of Subpart BB to Part 1952 containing the decision.The Plan provides for the adoption of Federal Standards as State Standardsby:1. Advisory Committee coordination.2. Publication in newspapers of general/major circulation with a 45-daywaiting period for public comment and hearings.3. Adoption by the Wyoming Health and Safety Commission.4. Review and approval by the Governor.5. Filing with Secretary of State and designation of an effective date.OSHA regulations (29 CFR 1953.22 and 1953.23) require that States respondto the adoption of new or revised permanent Federal standards by Statepromulgation of comparable standards within six months of OSHA publicationin the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, and within 30 days for emergency temporary standards.Although adopted State standards or revisions to standards must be submittedfor OSHA review and approval under procedures set forth in Part 1953, theyare enforceable by the state prior to federal review and approval. By letterdated October 21, 1988 from John T. Chambers, Former Assistant Administrator,Wyoming Occupational Health and Safety Division, to Byron R. Chadwick,OSHA Regional Administrator, the State submitted rules and regulationsin response to the following Federal OSHA General Industry Standards (29CFR 1910.1200: Hazard Communication 52 FR 31852, 8/24/87; 29 CFR 1910.1928:Benzene, 52 FR 34462, 9/11/87; 29 CFR 1910.268: Telecommunications, 52FR 36384, 9/28/87). By letter dated January 11, 1989, from Stephan R. Foster,Assistant Administrator, Wyoming Occupational Health and Safety Division,to Byron R. Chadwick, OSHA Regional Administrator, the State submittedrules and regulations in response to the following Federal OSHA GeneralIndustry Standards (29 CFR 1910.1048: Formaldehyde, 52 FR 46168, 12/4/87;29 CFR 1910.217, Mechanical Power Presses_Presence Sensing Device Initiation,53 FR 8322, 3/14/88).The above adoptions of Federal standards have been incorporated in theState Plan and are contained in the Wyoming Occupational Health and SafetyRules and Regulations for General Industry, as required by Wyoming Statute1977, section 27-11-105(a)(viii).State standards for 29 CFR 1910.1200: Hazard Communication were adoptedby the Health and Safety Commission of Wyoming on February 5, 1988 (effectiveMarch 8, 1988); State standards for 29 CFR 1910.1028: Benzene were adoptedby the Health and Safety Commission of Wyoming on February 5, 1988 (effectiveMarch 9, 1988); State standards for 29 CFR 1910.268: Telecommunicationswere adopted by the Health and Safety Commission of Wyoming on February5, 1988 (effective February 19, 1988); State standards for 29 CFR 1910.1048:Formaldehyde and for 29 CFR 1910.217: Mechanical Power Presses_PresenceSensing Device Initiation were both adopted by the Health and Safety Commissionof Wyoming on June 14, 1988 (effective August 4, 1988). Adoption of allthese standards was pursuant to Wyoming Statute 1977, section 27-11-105.The State standards on Hazardous Communications, Benzene, Telecommunications,Formaldehyde, and Mechanical Power Presses_Presence Sensing Device Initiationare all substantially identical to the Federal Standards actions, withthe only exceptions being paragraph numbering and minor wordage appropriateonly to the Wyoming statutes.According to Wyoming's Letter of May 19, 1989, to Byron R. Chadwick, RegionalAdministrator, the State will not have its own requirements for recognitionof third-party validation organizations for the standard on presence sensingdevice initiation for mechanical power presses. Wyoming is instead relyingon Federal OSHA's third-party recognition program as outlined in AppendixC. Applications will be filed with Federal OSHA in Washington, DC.<ITAG tagnum="84">2. Decision</ITAG>The above State Standards have been reviewed and compared with the relevantFederal Standards, and OSHA has determined that the State Standards areat least as effective as the comparable Federal Standards, as requiredby section 18(c)(2) of the Act. OSHA has also determined that the differencesbetween the State and Federal Standards are minimal and that the Standardsare thus substantially identical. OSHA therefore approves these standards;however, the right to reconsider this approval is reserved should substantialobjections be submitted to the Assistant Secretary.<ITAG tagnum="84">3. Location of Supplement for Inspection and Copying</ITAG>A copy of the standards supplements, along with the approved plan, maybe inspected and copied during normal business hours at the following locations:Office of the Regional Administrator, Room 1576, Federal Office Building,1961 Stout Street, Denver, Colorado 80294; the Occupational Health andSafety Department, 604 East 25th Street, Cheyenne, Wyoming 82002; and theOffice of State Programs, Room N-3700, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington,DC. 20210.<ITAG tagnum="84">4. Public Participation</ITAG>Under 29 CFR 1953.2(c), the Assistant Secretary may prescribe alternativeprocedures to expedite the review process or for any other good cause whichmay be consistent with applicable laws. The Assistant Secretary finds thatgood cause exists for not publishing the supplements to the Wyoming StatePlan as a proposed change and making the Regional Administrator's approvaleffective upon publication for the following reason(s):The standards were adopted in accordance with the procedural requirementsof State law which included public comment, and further public participationwould be repetitious. This decision is effective June 23, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> Sec. 18, Pub.
