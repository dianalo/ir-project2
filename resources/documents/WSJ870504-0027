Regarding its other preferred share class, known as exchangeable preferreds, the company said it will pay $600,000 of $1.6 million in dividends owed in June. It said the balance will be paid from a special trustee account.    As previously reported, dividends on both series were deferred in the last quarter of 1986 to conserve cash flow. The December and March obligations of exchangeable preferred shares were paid by the trustee account. The company said it decided to declare dividends now because of the successful conclusion of its financing negotiations with lenders.    For the Series Two shares, it said stock of record June 22 will be paid 18 cents a share on June 30. The amount represents both the regular June dividend and the arrears. For the exchangeable preferreds, the company declared a dividend of 25 cents, also payable June 30 to stock of record June 22. The remainder will be paid early in July to stock of record June 30, by the trustee.    As previously reported, the trustee account is funded from dividends derived from British Columbia Resources' holding of 3.3 million common shares of Westcoast Transmission Co., Vancouver. The preferred shareholders also have the right to exchange their securities for the Westcoast common stock.    After the July payout, the trust account will have about $100,000 to $150,000 from past Westcoast dividends, British Columbia Resources said. At the current rate of Westcoast dividend payments, the account is accumulating additional funds at the rate of about $658,000 quarterly. </TEXT></DOC>
