(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Investigations of alleged theft, cover-upsand illegal political contributions at Gulf Power Co. have promptednew accounting and ethics policies among the toughest in corporateAmerica, the utility says.   At least three Gulf Power employees have been fired or pressuredto resign because of alleged financial wrongdoing, company officialssay. Others were reprimanded or reassigned as part of efforts tohalt corruption.   A federal grand jury probe, a mysterious plane crash and thedisappareance of a graphic designer who worked for the utility allhelped to place Gulf Power under intense scrutiny in the last year.   ``I am truly convinced that Gulf Power is on the right tracknow,'' Dr. Reed Bell, a Pensacola pediatrician and chairman of theutility's audit committee, wrote in a June 26 letter to employees.``Virtually all of the problems ... I believe to be part of thecompany's past.''   Bell has been a critic of past practices, accusing management ofkeeping him and other outside directors in the dark about what hetermed unethical conduct, misconduct, mismanagement cover-ups andmoney laundering.   Hanging on walls throughout Gulf's headquarters now is a copy ofan ethics code prohibiting the doctoring of company books, usingcorporate funds for indirect political contributions, breaking lawsfor business ends, having financial conflicts of interest andaccepting gifts from companies doing business with the utility.   Many of the prohibitions cover the sorts of troubles that begansurfacing when Douglas McCrary received an anonymous letter repletewith allegations after he became Gulf's president in 1983.   McCrary brought in a pair of investigators.   Top executives reimbursed the company for using certain materialsand services for personal purposes, although insisting most had beennormal perquisites.   Last year, two former Gulf managers were convicted of tax fraudand a Pensacola businessman was convicted of perjury in kickbackschemes. They allegedly stole more than $80,000 by billing Gulf formaterials never delivered.   Little attention was paid to Gulf outside the Florida Panhandleuntil almost a year ago, when a federal grand jury began probing thefinancial practices of its Atlanta-based parent, Southern Co.   On April 10, 1988, Gulf became a focus of national attention whenits senior vice president, Jacob Horton, and two Southern pilotsdied in a plane crash four minutes after taking off from Pensacola'sairport.   The cause of the crash remains a mystery, but just hours beforethe crash Horton was told the audit committee had recommended thathe be fired because of accounting irregularities.   An investigative report submitted to the committee indicatedInternal Revenue Service agents had targeted Horton, SouthernPresident Edward Addison, former Southern President Alvin Vogtle andstate Sen. W.D. Childers, D-Pensacola, a close friend of Horton.   The bizarre happenings continued when lawyer Fred Levin, who metwith Horton the day he died, claimed four dead canaries with theirnecks broken were left outside his office and homes, apparently aswarnings against ``singing'' to authorities.   Although the full scope of the investigations has yet to bedisclosed, Gulf officials say they have taken steps to tighten theutility's purchasing, contracting and warehousing operations. Theyalso have suspended an informal political fund-raising organizationand encouraged employees to anonymously report alleged wrongdoing.   ``A vendor can no longer do business with Gulf Power Co. unlessthey have a contract with the company,'' said Gulf spokesman CarterHaynes. ``Used to, if there was something I needed at an officesupply store ... I could pick up supplies and they could bill us.''   McCrary also has sent a letter to vendors urging them to let himknow if employees have tried to coerce them into making politicalcontributions because that is against company policy and no longertolerated, Haynes said.   The report to the audit committee alleged Horton had arranged forthe utility to reimburse a supplier for a $1,000 campaign donation.Current and former employees have complained they felt pressuredinto making contributions through Gulf's official political actioncommittee.   The Atlanta grand jury has subpoenaed campaign finance records of32 state, local and federal candidates in Florida, including thoseof Sen. Bob Graham, former Gov. Reubin Askew and former Sen. PaulaHawkins. A subpoena is not an indication of any wrongdoing.   Contracts for legal and other professional services now are moredetailed and can be approved only by McCrary, Haynes said.   A mid-managment official had approved contracts with Ray Howell,a graphic designer paid $1.2 million by the utility from 1980through last year.   Howell flew to Atlanta to testify before the grand jury Dec. 7,but never appeared. He turned up two days later in the office of aMissouri lawyer to sign over his interest in their Pensacola home tohis ex-wife. He was never seen again.</TEXT></DOC>
