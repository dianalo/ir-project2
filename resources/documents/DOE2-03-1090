The radiological parameters employed for the assessment of ulcerationswere excavations of the vascular contour, ill defined vessel walls andsteep plaque surfaces. Overall sensitivity of DSA was 66%, specificity52%. The depth of excavations proved to be the most accurate sign indetecting ulcerative lesions (sensitivity 83%). However, in rare casesmural recesses with the angiographic appearance of ulceration correspondedto reendothelialised cavities. Small intimal disruptions with a depthof 0.1 to 1 mm could not be detected by intravenous DSA.</TEXT></DOC>
