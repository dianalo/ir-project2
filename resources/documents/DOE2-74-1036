However,since the melting of these glasses requires high temperatures of 1100-1250deg C, there is a fear of volatilization of harmful constituents, suchas Cs and Ru. To handle it at rather low temperature, we contrived amethod in which the calcined wastes are mixed with porous glass powdersand pressed in room temperature and then sintered at the temperatureof 600-900 deg C, employing the porous high silica glass as matrix materials.The structure and properties of the solidified forms obtained by thismethod has been investigated correlating to the mixing condition. Asthe result, it was confirmed that the mixed state of glass and the wasteaffects decisively the properties of solid. Hence, with strict controlof these conditions of mixing, a solid having chemical durability 10/sup-6/ g/cm/sup 2/center dotday in leach rate and porosity of about 10 %can be obtained by this sintering method at considerably low temperatures.The leachability of the solid forms almostly corresponds to HLW-containingborosilicate glasses.</TEXT></DOC>
