(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>One of the more interesting aspects of looking through VARs' answers to ourLAN 100 survey was reading their comments on seven optional essay questionson topics ranging from their biggest problems to MIS' changing role innetworking.andP;  Several bedevilments (primarily the difficulties in finding andkeeping good technical people and price cutting) popped up repeatedly.andO;Here's what the top network VARs in North America had to say.andM;1.andP;  What are the biggest problems facing your company?andM;* Michael Takemura, Overland Computer Services: In their race to pushproducts through distribution, many manufacturers attempt to pushconnectivity products through the Channel, without requiring appropriate andcommensurate levels of support from distributors.andP;  Because themanufacturers-want to limit the amount of end user support they must give,they push it off to the distributors/dealers.andP;  Effectively, you can be an&quot;authorized dealer&quot; for many technically-oriented products that require highlevels of support bY sending a manufacturer two box tops and a note from acustomer saying you know how to spell networking.andM;Now that distributors have caught on to the network buzzwords, many takelarge amounts of inventory from the manufacturers in an attempt to cash in on&quot;Your one-stop distributor for networking products.&quot; Yet attempt to call adistributor for technical support, and you usually get a telemarketingrepresentative who has gone to a three-day seminar on networks.andP;  Manydistributors don't even use networks.andM;Margins for the box pushers have tightened.andP;  So now everyone sells networks,again trying to cash in on higher margins.andP;  With a sales staff of four (threewho don't know the difference between Arcnet or Ethernet), a support staff ofone or two (one who doesn't know how to troubleshoot an XT-compatible),dealers claim they can network anything.andP;  The industry is limited to ahandful of dealers with competent staffs who have made the investment to selland support networks.andP;  Dealers must realize that with the polarization in theindustry, a large-volume dealer (even some of the large chains) cannotadequately support what they are selling without a large investment in highlytrained technical people and equipment.andP;  For example, trying to supportnetworks without investing in a cable tester is like trying to check thetiming of your car without a timing gun.andP;  And sending someone to Novelltraining for a couple of days does not make a support staff.andP;  Yet dealerswill tell the customer they can support anything.andP;  How can you support a LANinstallation, guaranteed response time and level of support, for 10 percentmargins? Something tells me that possibly there is some dishonestly in theindustry !andP;  In the end, as users attempt to implement LANs, many have adoptedthe same three criteria they use for single-unit purchases: They want itfree.andP;  They want it yesterday.andP;  And they want it guaranteed forever.andP;  Untilthis mentality is curbed, end users may be the striking force for the stateof the industry for manufacturers, distributors, and dealers.andP;  End users whoask a dealer to install/service/support a LAN and expect it for 10 to 15percent margin just simply are not realistic.andP;  Additionally, an end user whobelieves a dealer who says he can do this, come see me, I have a bridge foryou.andP;  For the increasing number of users who decide to implement in-housesupport staffs, they must look critically at developing strongerrelationships with dealers/ manufacturers.andP;  Without a stronger workingrelationship/partnership between these entities, the level of support willbecome more anemic.andM;*Stan Chan, Select Data Systems: Communicating to our clients and prospectsthe distinction of our experience, commitment, quality, and depth of supportfor our networking services and products over other resellers in ourmarketplace.andP;  There are many qualified installers and resellers in themarketplace.andP;  So, when a network prospect is deciding who is the organizationthat will provide the best services and support for his network, they oftenmatch up one credential of one reseller to one of the other resellers.andO;Resellers are only going to give out good references.andP;  On paper, theprospects view that one organization is as good as another bidding for thenetwork.andP;  Often it comes down to either price or intangibles that are hardfor some prospects to perceive.andM;Because our company is committed to the depth of service that is needed inevery network installation, our prices often are higher than the others.andO;Thus we must show our prospects and clients that we are the best in what wedo.andM;As margins dwindle and networking products are being marketed as PC commodityitems, our company's challenge will be facing the fact of surviving ourcommitment to service, training, and support without compromise.andM;* Michael Bennett, PTXI: Low hardware product [profit] margins.andP;  Until we'vewon an account, we have found it difficult to compete with &quot;box pushers-many...customers are too concerned with up-front costs.andP;  When we lose a deal onhardware price, I can assure [you] that the client was the real loser.andM;* John Larkin, Overland Computer Services: Margins are at an all-time low andgetting worse.andP;  All microcomputer resellers should be required to attendcourses in basic economics and accounting before they're allowed to sellproducts.andP;  Selling below cost and making up for it in volume doesn't work inthe long run.andM;Channel conflict continues to rear its ugly head.andP;  Some companies,particularly those with mini or mainframe backgrounds like Oracle, havegutter ethics in working with resellers and compete directly against themwith the same customers, sometimes at costs under those of their resellers.andM;* Steve Plotkin, Real World Systems: Controlling rapid growth.andP;  We grew 1,471percent in the past five years and occupy the No.andP;  180 [spot) on the inc. 500for 1989.andP;  Subduing the three hazards [rapid consumption of working capital,controlling expenses, maintaining high service levels] of surging growth.andO;Solving LAN orphan problems-&quot;adopting&quot; despondent users disappointed andabandoned by previous vendors.andM;* Rick Rechtschaffer, LANSource: Cash flow, vendor terms, client deposits, nocertification, cost of training [customers, such as MDs, CPAs, attorneys].andM;* Kelley Starr, Subject, Wills: Managing fast growth.andP;  We must deal withtrying to manage our resources and services [and] avoiding unprofitableopportunities.andP;  The LAN business is growing at such a rate that there are toomany business opportunities to get involved in.andP;  We use discretion inqualifying our prospects.andM;* Bill Juhl, Panlogic Systems: Managing growth, adapting to changingenvironment and technologies, making constant directional shift decisions,positioning ourselves for sustaining business growth and profitability, andlearning what we are not going to do.andM;* Jon LaPorte, Entre Computer Center: Accelerated growth.andP;  Keeping enoughqualified staff to keep up with it.andP;  Keeping our customers satisfied that weare reacting to their specific needs in a timely fashion.andP;  We have acquiredmany new customers [who] want us to treat them as if they are our onlycustomers !andP;  * Chuck Stegman, Businessland: We have thousands of sales andtechnical people that we need to keep up to date on an industry that changesat a dizzying pace.andP;  They in turn need to keep tens of thousands of customersaware of technologies that may help them to gain an edge on theircompetitors.andP;  Our technical people are spending 20 percent of their time intraining of some type.andM;An even bigger challenge is keeping technical decision makers at ourcustomers current on the explosion of capabilities of the once-lowly desktopcomputer network.andM;* Douglas Lang, Micro Systems Solutions: I reviewed over 150 resumes during1989, and only five were from people worth interviewing.andP;  There is a realshortage of qualified networking-savvy people, especially in thecomputer-aided drafting and design vertical [markets].andP;  It takes six monthsto a year to train people to the level required to sell and support ourproduct and service offerings.andM;* Mark Rosenblum, Mark One Computer Networks: Technicians who understand PCsdon't know networking; [those] who understand networking don't understanddata communications.andP;  Salespeople can't see a client's big picture.andP;  Thepeople with these talents are the owners of the companies we compete against.andM;* Anthony DeFario, Network Alternatives: Installing a system is much likecoding software.andP;  There is no room for error.andP;  Couple the need for perfectionwith an environment characterized by different versions of numerouscomponents from a multitude of vendors, change the technology almost daily,and you have a gargantuan task.andP;  Then add the customer's demand for immediateresponse, ready spares, and low prices.andP;  Trying consistently to match or beatcustomer expectations and ensuring zero-defect installation is our biggesttask.andM;* Mike Everatt, LANstart: Dealing with rapid industry growth and our positionin the industry.andP;  The technologies used are moving targets, and stayingabreast of everyone's technology is an impossible task.andM;* John Riesenburger, Micro Support: Keeping up with the technology.andP;  in thelast 12 months, there has been a flood of new LAN products.andP;  Most of theproducts work; some don't.andP;  Our customers demand the latest in technology,and sometimes this comes at a very expensive price to both the customer andvendor.andP;  It seems that only the manufacturer is the clear winner in ourindustry.andM;* James Cavanagh, Allied Data Communications Group: The broadest issues wewrestle daily are those of true standards versus de facto standards,standards versus performance, and what truly is, for the client, the optimumdeliverable system.andM;* Louis Turkaly, Syntrex: Name recognition.andP;  Syntrex is a $50 millioncorporation with network professionals located in 19 cities.andP;  We have a largereferenceable customer base.andP;  We have unique hardware and softwarecapabilities.andP;  Yet, we are relatively unknown.andM;* Tom Hennings, Winson, Olson: Locating good technical people, cash, [and]the nearest bar.andM;2.andP;  What are the major trends in the LAN industry?andM;* Mark Cuban, MicroSolutions: Scalability is a new buzzword for the 1990s.andO;it means the effect of taking your existing network components, server,topology, operating system, workstations, and software and growing them tomeet the needs of an organization without throwing away anything.andM;Productivity is back in fashion.andP;  If it was the &quot;year of the LAN&quot; in themidto-late-'80s, it is the &quot;year to make users productive&quot; in the  90s.andO;Groupware products such as IBM's OfficeVision and Lotus' Notes will be thefirst products that integrate an entire organization, improve theproductivity of the organization's workers, and allow it to better compete inits marketplace.andM;The last trend is the acceptance of OS/2 at the workstation level.andP;  Lotus,Excel, Wordperfect, R:base, and many others all offer OS/2 products.andO;Although there is a big fuss about the cost of RAM to make a PC &quot;OS/2 able,&quot;I think once people start to see the productivity gains and the competitiveadvantages that can be gained by combining these packages with the likes ofNotes and OfficeVision, the stumbling block of upgrades will disappear.andO;After all, it wasn't long ago that companies were spending $5K or more on XTsand ATs.andP;  Why? Because they made them more productive and competitive.andP;  Justwhat OS/2 will do for them today.andM;* Jon LaPorte, Entre Computer Center: It used to be &quot;I need a PC,&quot; and nowit's, &quot;I need a LAN.&quot; Unfortunately, as with PCs, the customer isn't alwayssure what he really needs a LAN for or what it'll do for him.andM;* Gary Ensminger, Micro One: The most noticeable trend is the acceptance andimplementation of PC-based networks as data processing systems which arenecessary in the conduct of business.andP;  Corporations and law firms areincreasingly adopting this technology as a strategic element in businesscompetition.andP;  Evidence of this trend occurs as more clients seek us outrather than the other way around.andM;Also noticeable is the validation of standards-based computing in thecomputer industry.andP;  In addition, the market is rejecting proprietary hardwareand closed operating systems (all operating systems are, in fact,proprietary).andP;  Weak proprietary product companies are failing orconsolidating in an attempt to survive.andP;  Stronger companies such as IBM andDEC are continuing to experience the bottom line pain of the industry changesand will have to downsize considerably to survive.andM;In the reseller business, there is a move toward consolidation to achievecritical mass for growth and create a major end-user organization, capable ofcompeting for the emerging WAN marketplace.andP;  Future needs require the abilityto handle the installation and support needs of large multinationalcompanies.andP;  This signals a fundamental change in the requirements forsurvival for the resellers of the future.andP;  Local-based resellers will be hardpressed to compete and participate in this market and as a result will bestratified to the lower end or fail.andM;Resellers will increasingly feel the heat from the minicomputer/mainframemanufacturers in a way they haven't experienced before LAN/WAN systemsencroach into their turf.andP;  In addition, mini and mainframe manufacturers arefinally are attempting to adopt serious challenges in the PC network arena.andO;While it is still difficult to predict how this trend will develop, it couldheavily impact resellers who use low pricing and low margins as their primarymarketing strategy.andM;* Laurie Balian, Data Systems Network: The technological aspects of networksare changing so quickly, the choices about what kind of computer to acquirewill be made on the basis of personal choice and application requirements,rather than what will work with a current system.andM;* John Larkin, Overland Computer Services: Greater connectivity amongdiffering operating systems  UNIX to Novell to OS/2 LAN Manager to other miniand mainframe OSs).andP;  OS/2 should emerge as a very strong contender againstNovell in the late 1990 to early 1991 period.andP;  ISDN may become a major factorin the hardware connectivity side to blend with OS/2 software as a totalconnectivity solution over wide area networks and  dispersed corporate localarea networks/mini/ mainframe systems.andM;* Chuck  Stegman,  Businessland: Bandwidth that seems like more than enoughone day quickly becomes inadequate.andP;  Factors contributing to this includemultitasking at the desktop, larger hard disk sizes, faster desktop systemsthat can churn through more data, graphics in documents (and even graphicaluser interfaces), and more applications of the network.andP;  What we have is anexponential growth of the use of data that will require exponentially morepowerful servers and careful planning and management.andM;* Bill Juhl, Paniogic Systems: The prior religious belief in free lunches,self-installed and self-managed LANs, and the tooth fairy all to be on thewane.andP;  CEOs, CFOs, DP/MIS managers, net managers, and office managers arestarting to accept the price of service as inherent in embracing thetechnology of the micro and the LAN connectivity that ties it together.andM;* Ulises Castillo, Comper, S.A.andP;  de C.V.: An increasing interest inclient-server architecture, mainly in database server, and a lot of goodfront ends (at least on paper).andP;  In the workstation: the 8088 is dead.andP;  Many286s and 386s.andP;  In the server: the 286 is dead.andP;  Many big customers arewaiting to see the 486.andP;  The minis have two ways [to go]: to be dead or to bea LAN server.andM;* Eric Schwartz, Digital Network Assoc.- Users have become more educated onLANs and technology.andP;  Electronic mail's time has come.andP;  Because of thesimplified user interfaces provided today, users are more willing to usee-mail as the primary vehicle for intra-company communication and filetransfer.andP;  The integration of fax gateways is also contributing to thesuccess of e-mail.andP;  The X.400 products becoming available will continue topush this at a rapid clip.andM;Another major growth segment [is] network management.andP;  Users are demandingmore comprehensive diagnostic and control of their networks.andP;  The SNMPstandard is providing the building blocks for comprehensive networkmanagement control centers.andM;* Tyrone Pike, LANSystems: Moving toward the client-server model, toward moredistributed processing.andP;  WANs and the marriage of telecom and datacom [alsocan't be] ignored.andP;  Ron Peri, Computer Support of North America: A growingrecognition that LANs are actually faster and better for many applicationsthan were mainframes.andP;  A second major trend [is] an increasing demand forbigger and faster file servers and disks.andP;  A year ago, many of the servers weinstalled had 4MB of RAM and 300MB of disk space, [now] servers with 16MB ofRAM and 1GB of disk are more typical.andP;  We expect the 486 to be the server ofchoice in 1990.andM;OS/2 is starting to have an impact.andP;  For the first time, we are seeingapplications that require multitasking [capabilities] or larger memory thanDOS can handle.andP;  1990 may be the year for OS/2.andP;  Database servers areproviding significant performance improvement for database applications.andP;  Itis not unreasonable to expect a down-sized application to run 10 times fasteron a LAN with a database server than the application did when it was on themainframe.andP;  Groupware is coming on strong.andP;  A year ago, most clients wantedonly e-mail; [now] everyone is demanding scheduling.andM;* Greg Boyd, iLAN: OS/2 is dead, at least until a 32-bit implementation isavailable.andP;  We are seeing wide growth in Windows 386.andP;  Macs are a hot item inthe LAN market.andP;  Distributed database servers will be hot.andP;  They arejustifying minicomputer replacements.andP;  All LANs in the  90s will run onunshielded twisted-pair with fiber backbones.andP;  We see no remaining advantageto proprietary cabling.andM;* Harvey Kramer, Kramer Systems intli.: Greater customer knowledge of LANsand less dependence on the VAR.andP;  The customer gets full consulting andassistance with designing and implementing the LAN, generally at no charge,but after initial installation all that matters is price.andP;  [surveys report)that price is a low-level consideration and that quality and performance arealways more important.andP;  In reality, that does not appear to be the case.andM;* Steve Plotkin, Real World Systems: Consolidation; the independent LAN VARappears to find merging an alluring way to recapture the glory days of highermargins.andP;  LANs will continue to outflank mini and mainframe empires.andP;  TheOS/2 family operating systems will propel customer confusion to new heights.andO;Barbed wire will become the twisted-pair standard for the 1990s.andP;  Fiber optic[cable) comes down to 10 cents a foot.andM;* Kelley Starr, Subject, Wills: Unbundling of services.andP;  Too many LANproducts [exist] for any one organization to be an expert in.andP;  The supportand inventoryandM;commitments  are overwhelming.andM;* Joel Binn, Pentagon: Long term: Cable TV connections with wide areanetworking will allow the home computer to enjoy the power and accessreserved for today's office systems.andP;  Going to the office can easily becomean idea of the past.andM;3.andP;  What problem do you most often encounter when installing a LAN?andM;* Kevin Brown, Brown and Assoc.: Client expectations.andP;  As the market channelsconfuse the consumer, it's difficult for the consumer to understand valueversus price.andP;  The reseller generally suffers as a result.andP;  Clients generallyunderestimate the training [required in] a LAN.andM;* Arnold Bellini, Micro information Solutions: Making sure the client hasinvested enough budget to implement software solutions effectively.andP;  Toooften, a company allocates enough money for hardware and ignores the softwareinvestment necessary to make the LAN productive.andM;* James Cavanagh, Allied Data Communications Group: The people who actuallyuse the LAN [of consulted as to their desires and needs.andP;  The most successful(read, productive and well-accepted) LANs are those implemented by theparticipants of a workgroup, done outside normal DP channels.andP;  The lesssuccessful (read, less productive and less well-accepted by users) LANs arethose planned and implemented by a central corporate body or high-leveldepartmental group.andM;* Robert Dale, Austin Data Systems: Lack of understanding on the part of thecustomer about the extra time and care required to install a networkproperly.andM;* Tyrone Pike, LANsystems: Inadequate preparation by the client and othercontractors (such as cable installers).andM;* Mike Everatt, LANstart: When installing a large LAN, the client wants touse the LAN before it's fully operational.andP;  Once the client has access to thepartially finished LAN, he/she begins to depend on it and will not want it togo down in order for us to continue to work on it.andM;* Jeffrey Archer, Data Systems Marketing: The most common are found in thecabling.andP;  Unshielded twisted-pair is the worst offender.andP;  With[twisted-pair], [we] find a faulty patch cable configuration at the punchdownblock resulting in an improper pin configuration, which [divides] the twistedpairs.andP;  With coaxial cable (thick and thin), [we] consistently find improperterminations, especially with thin coax.andM;* Joel Binn, Pentagon: Cabling and electrical troubleshooting.andP;  Networkmanagement facilities perform the very valuable function of isolating theproblem, but the less-than-15-user LAN does not normally opt for networkmanagement options and therefore remains the more difficult installation.andM;* Mark Rosenblum, Mark One Computer Networks: Many of the large companieswant their building maintenance crews to pull the cables.andP;  They don't alwaysunderstand how critical correctly installing cable is to the operation of ahigh-speed [LAN].andP;  We spend hours tracing cable problems because of improperinstallation.andP;  The client ends up paying for our time to troubleshoot theproblem and ultimately spends more than if [we'd done] it in the first place.andM;* Greg Boyd, iLAN: The desire to reuse existing badly cabled UTP for the LAN.andM;* Douglas Lang, Micro Systems Solutions: Integrating existing hardware andapplications software onto a LAN we're installing.andP;  Many clients expect us toget every piece of hardware and software they have ever purchased up andrunning.andP;  This is much easier said than done! We are constantly rewriting ourcontracts to more clearly define their scope, so that we do not get burnedfinancially.andM;* Harvey Kramer, Kramer Systems: As we integrate products from differentmanufacturers, there is always something that has to be done that is notdocumented and only known by one or two individuals at the manufacturer.andO;This results in drawn-out installation and frustration on the part of ourtechnical staff.andM;* Russ Edelman, integrated Computer Management: The biggest problems arebased on conflicts.andP;  Hardware addressing (I/O, IRQ, and DMA channels) andmemory management [are] key considerations.andM;* Tom Hennings, Winson Olson: A new product or release that doesn't work.andP;  Wespend 20 percent of our install time doing the &quot;cookie cutter&quot; stuff and theother 80 percent in diagnosing bugs in new products or releases.andM;* Mark Cuban, MicroSolutions: The reliability of tape backups and gettingcustomers to test and retest their backups to verify their quality.andP;  Evenwith multiple generations of backup, too often customers will accept on blindfaith that a backup was good and not follow our testing procedures forverification.andM;* Kelley Starr, Subject, Wills: Printers are the hardest component to finetune, and it usually cannot be preinstalled because every user has adifferent use for their printers.andM;4.andP;  What's the biggest misconception about LANs that your customers have?andM;* Chuck Stegman,  Businessland: Many customers think that LANs are as simpleas the advertisements make them appear.andP;  A network can require a dozen disksof patches before the network, its gateway, and applications are up andrunning.andP;  Since we know about the patches and have them, it seems easy to usand to the customer.andP;  Then they try the next LAN on their own.andM;Others think that LANs are toys that aren't dependable yet.andP;  They've heardhorror stories about installs gone amiss, worms, breached security, diskcrashes without backup, etc.andM;The truth is somewhere in between.andP;  LANs, properly installed and properlymanaged, will be very strategic to an organization.andP;  We certainly considerour own WAN to be strategic to our business.andM;* Tom Hennings, Winson Olson: That somehow their life is going to be easieronce this thing gets installed.andP;  On the contrary, life gets quite a bit morecomplicated.andP;  Customers typically underestimate what the learning curve willbe.andP;  As much as we may warn them about coming up to speed, many customersexpect to reach peak efficiency after a month or so.andP;  The reality is morelike a year or two.andM;* Scott McCreary, Monterey-Waidec: Customers still have a tendency to view aLAN as a panacea to all their business problems.andP;  Regardless of repeatedexplanations, the LAN is often perceived to do far more than it is capableof, no matter how large or sophisticated.andM;* Russ Edelman, integrated Computer Management: Customers frequently assume aLAN is nothing more than a group of PCs strung together.andP;  The complexity of asystem is underestimated, which results in confusion and finger pointing.andM;* Gary Ensminger, Micro One: The largest misconceptions are generated by themanufacturers of significant LAN products.andP;  They, in general, wantcommodity-like volumes for their products, while at the same time claimingstate of the art technology and high-level product differentiation.andP;  Acertain amount of credibility [is] lost when supposedly significant LANproducts are authorized and sold through mail order, high-volume discounthouses and low-margin resellers.andM;Additionally, customers nearly always underestimate the financial and peopleresources required to make a LAN work for them.andM;Many seem to believe that the same protection, back up, and disaster recoveryneeds afforded a minicomputer or mainframe system do not apply to a LAN.andP;  Thesame corporate information which is elaborately protected with security andbackup systems is apparently not worth as much if put on a PC LAN.andM;* Mark Rosenblum, Mark One Computer Networks: That LANs can be purchased as acommodity item like stand-alone PCs.andP;  They think you just buy the hardwareand software, plug it in, and away you go.andP;  A lot of LAN users think theproblems with their networks are due to the technology and not the bargainprice they paid.andM;* Robert Dale, Austin Data Systems: That LANs are as cheap and easy to use asa microwave oven !andP;  * Brian Junnila, ComputerCorp Systems: The [assumption]that because LANs are so popular you need no technical ability to managethem.andP;  People with no DOS skills are being asked to manage small LANs.andM;* Harvey Kramer, Kramer Systems int'l.: The [lack of] importance [placed on]training and the degree of difficulty associated with being a first-timesupervisor and administrator.andP;  Unless [LAN administrators] have beenprofessionally trained, they can easily become overwhelmed.andM;* Tim Burkett, Jeff Brenner, Dana Sellers, Trinity Computing Systems: Theydon't perceive LANs as being as powerful as they can be-they don't comprehendthe full computer power available through LANs.andM;* Mike Anderson, Synco Computer Systems: That the operating environment of anetwork is so much different from the DOS environment that you have to beretrained.andM;* Jon LaPorte, Entre Computer Center: They often believe that you can put anysoftware on a LAN and expect it to work the same way it does on a stand-alonePC.andM;* Mark Cuban, MicroSolutions: Because Novell is the market leader, it is thesolution to all networking requirements.andP;  Nothing could be further from thetruth.andP;  An extension to this problem is that because so much press has beengiven to NetWare 386 and how easy it is to install, that any novice networkuser could do it himself or herself.andP;  They never bother to examine theincompatibilities of NetWare 386, or the fact that all the other difficultiesof networking, design, documentation and topology selection, don't go awayregardless of NOS.andM;* Joel Binn, Pentagon: A lot of mainframe customers [who are now getting intoLANs) often expect the same speed and database capabilities as they had withthe mainframe.andP;  Then there is the opposite type: The user who buys a LAN forword processing and cannot see doing serious work on a &quot;toy&quot; computer.andM;* Anthony DeFario, Network Alternatives: They tend to have a time-sharedmentality.andP;  They do not understand that the processing power of theworkstation is the main determinant of system performance.andM;* Frank Schumacher, Data Connections: The biggest misconception: Take onehigh-speed 386, add one NOS [network operating system], combine theappropriate number of LAN NICs [network interface cards] of your favoriteflavor, mix at high speed and serve one LAN.andP;  There is no one NIC/fileserver/NOS/cable plant that is the solution for all systems.andM;5.andP;  Are LANs returning to the control of MIS? is that good or bad, and why?andM;* Mark Cuban, MicroSolutions: Yes! Why? Because companies are looking attheir balance sheet and realizing they have hundreds of thousands, if notmillions, of dollars invested in PCs and networking technology.andP;  When thenumbers get that big, they start impacting many fundamental business issuessuch as return on investment, return on assets, net income, etc.andP;  The typicalMIS director, although this person may not be as LAN-literate as theadministrator, should have experience in managing a staff, which wouldinclude the LAN gurus, to facilitate the networks and PCs in place to allowthe company to meet its business goals.andP;  The MIS director should also bebetter situated to position limited resources so that creativity andproductivity at the user level can be optimized.andM;On the other hand, the typical network or departmental administrator has amicro view of the organization.andP;  He or she typically only knows the role ofthe network as it applies to departmental users, not as it applies to theorganization.andP;  As a result, the organization's needs may not be met, andworse, the typical LAN administrator is not going to know if they are beingmet.andM;* Richard Rosdal, Select Data Systems: In Fortune 500 companies, LANs are nowlargely controlled by MIS departments.andP;  The by-products of this developmentare both good and bad.andP;  With MIS overseeing the design and development  ofcorporate  internetworks, the focus is now on more carefully  plannedenterprise strategies.andM;In recent years MIS has expanded its technical capabilities in the LAN arenaand has reacted to departmental requests with more urgency and clarity.andP;  MISis providing a dimension of total system design to the evolution of corporatenetwork systems.andP;  One downside for the VAR is that this can take away some ofthe challenge and profitability from systems integration.andP;  MIS departmentsare more willing to work with multiple vendors and provide their own systemsintegrations services than are individual departments.andP;  The best tactic iswhen MIS departments work in tandem with an experienced systems integrationfirm that will take responsibility for a total system solution.andP;  The smallincrease in system costs is far outweighed by the advantages of a solesource.andM;* Gary Ensminger, Micro One: Generally yes.andP;  As PC LANs become a part of acorporate or law firm mission, then top management is going to insist oncontrol and protection of assets and the responsibility is generally going tofall to the group which has managed this function, which is MIS.andP;  The goodnews is that MIS management are systems-oriented and have a much betterunderstanding of the big picture.andP;  They tend to employ, manage, and supportLANs from that perspective rather than the commodity orientation of those whoonly have the PC, single user operating system, and departmental viewpoint.andO;The bad news is that MIS groups are notorious for their shortcomings inend-user support and flexibility, which is the strength of the PC guru.andM;* Chuck Stegman, Businessland: It's not an either/or situation.andP;  MIS isinvolved more in LANs than in years past ...andP;  and for good reason, LANs arebecoming more strategic after all.andP;  But they're not in exclusive control.andO;The user departments still have significant say.andP;  If both the users and MISagree, then it's simple.andP;  if they disagree, then sometimes it goes one wayand sometimes the other.andP;  Both parties have critical information tocontribute.andP;  The users best understand what the need is and MIS brings anunderstanding of information management issues.andM;* Ed Anderson, ComputerLand: Unfortunately, it seems that even PCs arereturning to the control of MIS.andM;* Kevin Brown, Brown and Assoc.: Larger corporations are slowly returningcontrol of all PCs to MIS.andP;  This is due to organization-wide systems strategyresponsibility.andP;  This is good from the demand perspective.andP;  Interest in LANshas increased.andP;  This is bad from the decision-by-committee&quot; perspective.andP;  MISdepartments generally require months of decision making via RFP [request forproposals], demonstrations, negotiating, and purchasing.andM;* Brian Junnila, ComputerCorp Systems: I believe MIS departments are the onlydepartments that can understand the importance of data backup and security.andO;But on the other side, with their close-minded control and single-treadedthoughts on growth, LANs would stagnate and not be as useful.andM;* Tom Hennings, Winson, Olson: In the larger companies, LANs are returning toMIS.andP;  Whether that's good or bad depends upon the MIS department.andM;Those impressive MIS departments who carefully plan and design their own LANscan do nothing but good for the rest of the LAN industry.andP;  After all, everygood installation of a LAN is one less possible minicomputer install theworld has to worry about.andP;  Of course, these MIS departments also know how toeffectively use the services of our company.andP;  They appreciate the fact thatwe've installed hundreds of networks and have everyday practical knowledge.andM;Those MIS departments who don't enlist outside help in planning and designingtheir LANs are doomed to make all of the traditional errors.andP;  After a year orso, they'll be the ones with a brand new AS/400 installed and a pile of 386file servers in the trash bin.andM;* Joel Binn, Pentagon: IBM created the AS/400 to be the expensive, hard-tousenetwork file server that only an MIS department can handle.andP;  This is sold asthe salvation of MIS; it gives them a way to recapture LANs that have grownthroughout the corporate world.andM;* Kelley Starr, Subject, Wills: Yes.andP;  If LAN integrators, particularly [thoseselling] total solutions, don't unbundle the consulting from the hardwaresales, [they] may find that the MIS department is not buying their totalsolution.andP;  MIS wants to unbundle LAN services and shop around.andM;* Bo Reahard, Sunrise Computer Systems: MIS is not interested.andP;  This is badbecause it leaves data processing in the  hands  of  ill-informed  micromanagers.andM;* Joseph Levi, 47th Street Computer: LANs are not returning to the control ofMIS.andP;  One drawback of an MIS-oriented system is that end users are removedfrom the [products] selection.andP;  Corporate users are now accustomed tocontrolling the PCs on their desks and integrating its function into theirwork routine.andP;  These users will assure the distributed nature of futuresystems.andM;* Tyrone Pike, LANsystems: Yes.andP;  There are basically two models we see.andP;  Oneis a decentralized view that allows departments to make decisions.andP;  The otheris a centralized mode, where MIS decides standards and sells its servicesthroughout the organization.andP;  The latter is growing.andM;* Greg Boyd, iLAN: Definitely.andP;  This year our service department reportedmore servers in computer rooms than not.andP;  This is a dramatic change.andM;6.andP;  What LAN vendors are you satisfied with? Why?andM;* Chuck Stegman, Businessland: Novell is great at delivering what people wanttoday and providing a solid path to the future.andP;  SynOptics is very helpfuland has sound technology.andP;  cc:Mail is listening well to what the market issaying about e-mail interconnectivity and e-mail management requirements.andO;Visionary vendors including NetFrame with their focus on reliability andmanageability and NEXT with their focus on easy network management are alsogood to work with.andM;* John Chavner, DataGuard Computer Management: No LAN hardware manufactureris doing particularly good or bad; they all run about the same.andP;  If you havea problem, they will generally get around to fixing it.andP;  If there areproblems with their products, most of them don't tell you about them untilyou call in to report that you've found a bug.andP;  Then they will acknowledge itif they or someone else has reported it already.andM;* Mark Cuban, MicroSolutions: I'm happy with Compaq and the System-pro andtheir LAN Manager.andP;  I'm feeling better about 3Com.andP;  They are finally makingsome aggressive moves with product functionality in 3+Open 1.1 and soon 2.0.andO;I'm on autopilot with Banyan.andP;  I think there's room for improvement inregards to how they handle support, but that's only because I expect morefrom them than I do from 3Com or Novell.andP;  I'm also happy with Apple.andP;  Theyare starting to realize what it takes to move Macintosh networking into thecorporate mainstream.andM;* Arnold Bellini, Micro information Solutions: Novel I certainly has the bestproduct.andP;  They need to address the 640K barrier in the workstation to stay ontop in the  90s.andM;* Trudi Amundson, AmeriData: IBM is very responsive to customers whether itbe a support, marketing, or sales issue.andP;  They also are cognizant of industrytrends [and] standards and have excellent support.andM;* Frank Schumacher, Data Connections: Gateway Communications and, finally,Novell! Gateway has consistently provided superb training and supportservices with an excellent product.andP;  As for Novell, they're still arrogantand obnoxious.andP;  But they, at least, restructured their distribution torecognize the importance of relatively small VARs such as ourselves.andP;  Theiremphasis on training as the requirement for authorization, rather thanpurchase guarantees, should be a model for all vendors.andM;* Greg Boyd, iLAN: SynOptics, 3Com, and Proteon.andP;  Neutral about Novell, whichis the best we have felt about them in three years.andP;  3Com started sellingaccount direct this year in a big way.andP;  We expect they will drop in oursatisfaction soon.andM;7.andP;  What LAN vendors are you dissatisfied with? Why?andM;* John Larkin, Overland Computer Services: if software vendors areconsidered, Oracle has the worst support for network products we've seen fromanybody in the industry at any time, anywhere.andP;  Perhaps that's why they alsohave the worst reseller policies and seem to think that channel conflict isgood for the soul.andM;* Ed Anderson, ComputerLand: I am dissatisfied with all the major vendors!andO;They're too busy competing against one another to notice that what theircustomers really want is for them to work with each other towards greaternetwork product interoperability.andM;* Tom Hennings, Winson, Olson: 3Com is as tuned out as you get.andP;  What arethey doing with LAN Manager? I wish someone could tell us.andM;* Kelley Starr, Subject, Wills: Novell.andP;  [Its] channel distribution haschanged again.andP;  The dissolution of the systems integrator program is still anannoying issue with [us].andP;  In an industry where it's sometimes hard todifferentiate the full-service LAN installers from the fly-by-nights, thesystem integrator program created a designation for qualified [Novell] LANintegrators.andP;  Systems integrators had to make Novell purchase commitments of$150,000 annually.andP;  They had to have certified NetWare engineers, and theyhad to be trained in data communications and hardware repair.andP;  Now that theprogram is gone, there is no way to discern the LAN integrator that sells twoLANs a year from the integrator who sells 100.andM;Novell [changed because] they are not a good distribution company.andP;  It coststoo much to send small quantities of [NetWare products] to the systemsintegrators when they have distributors buying hundreds at once.andP;  I have asolution.andP;  Why not continue to have systems integrators-just don't ship[products] to them.andP;  Everything is still in place to qualify and monitor theperformance of the systems integrators through their latest method ofdistribution.andP;  Are you listening Novell?andM;* Kevin Brown, Brown and Assoc.: We're generally dissatisfied with all PC, PCperipheral, and LAN vendors.andP;  The &quot;fast buck&quot; and &quot;market share&quot; mentalityhas created confused distribution channels and a wholly unrealistic set ofexpectations in resellers and consumers.andP;  A company great products andintentions inevitably backslides into standard industry practices due tomarket forces.andP;  How many Novell, 3Com, IBM, Apple, etc.andP;  policy changesbenefited resellers?andM;THE SIX BEST VENDORSandM;45%...andP;  NovellandM;23%...andP;  SynOpticsandM;19%...andP;  3ComandM;09%...andP;  Gateway CommunicationsandM;09%...andP;  ProteonandM;09%...andP;  Thomas-ConradandM;When 31 of The LAN 100 told us ofandM;the LAN vendors they were mostandM;satisfied with, most stressed that theandM;vendor is tuned into the market,andM;engineers great products at a fairandM;price, provides excellent supportandM;services, and doesn't sell directly toandM;end users.andM;LEAST SATISFACTORYandM;VENDORSandM;29%  ...andP;  NovellandM;14%  ...andP;  BanyanandM;09%  ...andP;  Racal-interlanandM;09%  ...andP;  TOPSandM;When asked what LAN companiesandM;they were most dissatisfied with, 21 ofandM;The LAN 100 were brave enough toandM;name names.andP;  Few complained aboutandM;poor product quality.andP;  By far, theandM;reasons for dissatisfaction are anchoredandM;in support and distributionandM;policies.andM;TOP 10andM;INSTALLATION PROBLEMSandM;1.andP;  CablingandM;2.andP;  Client's lack of understanding/expectationsandM;3.andP;  Software bugsandM;4.andP;  Non-networked softwareandM;5.andP;  Need for managementandM;6.andP;  integrating old or existingandM;equipmentandM;7.andP;  Printer setupandM;8.andP;  Electrical interferenceandM;9.andP;  Hardware conflictsandM;10.andP;  Proliferation of clones as serversandM;TOP 5andM;CLIENT MISCONCEPTIONSandM;1.andP;  LANs are off-the-shelf, do-it-yourselfandM;beingsandM;2.andP;  LANs don't need to be managedandM;3.andP;  LANs are a toy; can't replace aandM;miniandM;4.andP;  LANs are a panaceaandM;5.andP;  Users and administrators don'tandM;need training</TEXT></DOC>
