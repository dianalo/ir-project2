Allen.   On the eve of the telecommunications industry'squadrennial exposition here, Mr. Allen said the fact thatATandamp;T hasn't any current plan to construct on foreign soil theadvanced voice and data networks that would bypass countries'local phone companies &quot;doesn't mean we can't develop a planquickly or be in the business in the future.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Such a move would put ATandamp;T in direct competition withcompanies that it has spent most of this century cultivatingas long-term partners. ATandamp;T's relationships with thestate-owned phone authorities, generally called PTTs, havehelped give ATandamp;T a big edge over U.S. rivals who have had tonegotiate with these PTTs for connections to their nationalnetworks.   But, Mr. Allen said, many countries restrict competitionand are slow to respond to demands from corporations foradvanced communications services. &quot;If these services aren'tavailable {in some countries}, we could certainly be enticedinto offering them,&quot; he said.   One area where the company is pushing to improve serviceto business customers is the Soviet Union. Mr. Allen saidATandamp;T will add 24 private-line satellite circuits to those italready provides and will use the Soviet-operatedIntersputnik satellite system. While publicly switched linesprovide connections to regular customers on a first-come,first-served basis, private lines are leased to companies tobe used on a full-time basis.   The U.S. government recently dropped its opposition toATandamp;T using the Soviet system after the company lobbied forpermission to alleviate a critical shortage of availablecircuits. ATandamp;T declined to comment on how many privatecircuits it currently operates between the U.S. and theSoviet Union.   Mr. Allen said the company continues to urge the U.S.government &quot;to be more realistic&quot; about its restrictions onhigh-technology exports to the Soviets, and he said thecompany will officially open a Moscow office next year.   Separately, in Washington Friday, ATandamp;T asked the U.S.Court of Appeals to direct the Federal CommunicationsCommission to decide within 30 days on its complaint againstrival long-distance telephone company MCI CommunicationsCorp.   The complaint, filed Aug. 7, 1989, alleges that MCI failedto file with the FCC the rates and terms of itstelecommunications service offerings to several businesses,as required by the 1934 Communications Act.   ATandamp;T said that at issue is the ability of ATandamp;T to serveits customers as freely as its competitors. MCI couldn't bereached for comment.</TEXT></DOC>
