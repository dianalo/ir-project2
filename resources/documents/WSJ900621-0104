Researchers for the department used six common indicatorsof &quot;at-risk&quot; status: coming from a single-parent family,coming from a household with income below $15,000, being homealone more than three hours a day, having a dropout as asibling, having limited English skills and having parents whodidn't finish high school.   A 1988 survey of nearly 25,000 eighth-graders in 1,000public and private schools nationwide found that 53% had norisk factors and 26% had one. But just over 20% had two ormore. These students already showed low grades and highabsenteeism. The study will follow the sample as they movethrough high school and beyond, trying to identify factorsfostering or hindering success in school.   Along similar lines, a Louis Harris andamp; Associates surveylast year for Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., covering 2,000public school teachers in all grades, found them increasinglyconcerned over student behavioral problems.   Over half consider absenteeism a serious problem, andthree in four worry about the number of latchkey children,those left on their own after school. Compared with a similarsurvey only four years earlier, much higher percentages ofjunior high and high school teachers list student drinking,drug use, teen-age pregnancy, dropouts and suicide as seriousproblems.                                                                                                          Growth Will Make '90s   A Billion-Person Decade                                                                                                          FERTILITY RATES are inching up in a few low-fertilitycountries, including the U.S., but continue to decline inmany high-fertility countries.   Still, says the Population Reference Bureau, a privateresearch group in Washington, the 1990s will see the largestincrease in the world's population of any decade yet, addinganother billion people to the present 5.3 billion. It took 11years to add the last billion. By mid-1998, the bureaubelieves, the global population will surpass six billion.   The bureau's Carl Haub says the fertility rate hasrebounded from extremely low levels in several developedcountries. Government and private demographers now estimatethat the total fertility rate in the U.S. last year was 2.0-- the highest since 1972, though still below the 2.1replacement rate. The total fertility rate is the number oflikely lifetime births per woman.   The U.S. rate fell from a postwar high of 3.77 in 1957 toa low of 1.7 in 1976, then hovered around 1.8 for a decade.But the 1988 rate crept up to 1.9, and the 1989 rateapparently edged up further.   Sweden, West Germany, Iceland and Finland also have seenturnarounds. In Sweden, the rate fell to 1.6 in the early1980s, but has climbed back to 2.0. West Germany, which fellbelow 1.3 in 1985, has turned up to 1.4.   Demographers note that starting in the 1970s, more youngwomen delayed childbearing into their 30s, reducing thefertility rate. Now, these women are finally having theirchildren, helping to nudge the rate back up. Many specialistssay it's too early to tell whether there is also a movementback to slightly larger families.   Bangladesh, Egypt and China are among countriesexperiencing substantial declines in fertility rates. Mr.Haub figures Rwanda now has the world's highest rate, anestimated 8.3, while Italy's 1.3 is the lowest.                                                                                                          Voting-Age Populace   Is Becoming Grayer                                                                                                          BABY BOOMERS and old folks bulk ever larger in thevoting-age population.   The Census Bureau says the number of men and women 18years old and over will exceed 186 million by this fall'scongressional elections, nearly eight million higher than inthe 1986 off-year vote. Almost 82 million -- about 44% ofthis fall's total -- will be in the 25-to-44 age range, bornduring the baby boom years. This age group accounted for only38.5% of the total in 1980.   Of course, a large share of the voting-age populationdoesn't get around to voting. In the 1986 congressionalelections, only one-third actually voted.   The 65-plus age group will be 6.2 million larger this fallthan in 1980, accounting for about 17% of the voting-agepopulation. The relative size of the 18-to-24 group hasshrunk by one-quarter in the past decade, to 14% of thisfall's total, while the 45-to-64 bracket has increasedslightly in numbers but shrunk as a percentage of the whole.   Women of voting age continue to outnumber men. They willmake up 52% of the voting-age population and three out offive of those 65 and over.   Over 21 million blacks will be of voting age this fall, or11.3% of the total. In 1980, their percentage was 10.6%.About 11 million live in the South, accounting for 17% of thearea's voting-age population.                                                                                                          Odds and Ends   PROBLEMS with fertility put serious emotional burdens onboth marriage partners, but the stress on the wife isconsiderably greater than that on the husband, psychologistFrank Andrews and colleagues at the University of Michiganreport. . . . Nearly two out of three Americans believeMedicare benefits will shrink by the time they retire,according to a Gallup Organization poll for the EmployeeBenefit Research Institute. The younger the respondent, thegreater the concern. . . . Jobs that require pregnant womento stand for long hours substantially increase the risk ofpremature delivery, says a group of Yale Medical Schoolepidemiologists.</TEXT></DOC>
