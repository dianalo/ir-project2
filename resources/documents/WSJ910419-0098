The agency's science advisory board backed the conclusionsof an EPA draft report on secondhand smoke, although theboard did say the final report should give more weight to theactual experience of smokers, among other recommendations.</LP><TEXT>   The next move is up to EPA Administrator William Reilly;if he decides to list secondhand smoke as a Class Acarcinogen, that would put it in the same category as suchpollutants as asbestos and benzene. The EPA can't regulatesmoking, but if it classifies secondhand smoke as a knowncause of cancer that would increase pressure on theOccupational Safety and Health Administration to act onsmoking in the workplace. It also might increase the alreadyrapid spread of no-smoking signs in all kinds of publicplaces.   An EPA spokesman said there is no timetable for Mr.Reilly's action.   The American Lung Association hailed the advisory boardaction. At the same time, Thomas Borelli, a Philip MorrisCos. scientist, said he was encouraged that the panel foundfault with the study and that he hoped the EPA would reviseit before Mr. Reilly makes a decision.</TEXT></DOC>
