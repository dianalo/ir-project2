President Alfredo Cristiani said his government is not and wasnever threatened by the fierce, 3-day-old guerrilla offensive thathas turned the capital into a battlefield.   Government aircraft rocketed and strafed rebel positions on thenorthern and eastern perimeters of San Salvador and thousands ofresidents fled the battle zones.   At least 503 people have been killed and more than 1,000 woundedacross El Salvador since the guerrillas launched their offensiveSaturday night, according to military, hospital and morgue reports.   The rebels' Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN)issued a communique calling on its forces to ``take control of thewhole country,'' but also said it was willing to pursue a``democratic solution.'' It said local governments would beestablished in areas held by the rebels.   Cristiani, a rightist who took office June 1, said governmentforces have ``neutralized'' insurgents on San Salvador'ssoutheastern, southern and western periphery, but that combatcontinues against rebels on the northern outskirts.   ``The army is advancing, but advancing slowly,'' he told a newsconference. He accused the guerrillas of holding civilians hostageand of using them as screens against army counteroffensives.   ``The government was never in danger,'' he said. ``The peoplestated clearly and out loud that they were not going to support theFMLN. ... There is no danger whatever of the government beingtoppled.''   The degree of civilian support for the rebels, who haveentrenched themselves in several northern and eastern working-classsuburbs, is difficult to gauge.   Reporters have witnessed what appears to be respectful, evenamicable, treatment of the insurgents _ including the giving offood, water and intelligence. But it is unclear if the civiliansfeel coerced by the presence of hundreds of heavily armedcombatants in their neighborhoods.   Cristiani denied air force planes and helicopters had bombardedcivilian zones where the guerrillas are entrenched.   But Gen. Humberto Larios, minister of defense, virtuallycontradicted the president when, at the same news conference, heacknowledged that helicopters have fired rockets at guerrillapositions.   Associated Press reporters and photographers in northern andeastern sections of the city were able to visit rebel-held zonesand saw air attacks.   Nearly 100 civilians have been killed and more than 680 woundedin this capital since the fighting began, many of them reportedlycasualties of air attacks. Thousands of others have fled the battlezones.   U.S. Ambassador William Walker told an afternoon news conferencein the capital, ``It is not a situation that is any means stable asyet.''   He said the FMLN was ``pulling out all the stops'' in theoffensive but failing to achieve either its political or militaryobjectives.   Rebels with light anti-tank weapons attacked a national policeunit near his residence during the night but they were repelled bytroops, Walker said.   A guerrilla leader who uses the pseudonym Carlos Argueta said,``It's a new kind of war that could lead to the end of the war.''He spoke with AP in a rebel-controlled district in the capital'snorthern neighborhood of Zacamil.   FMLN leaders ordered the offensive after announcing they wouldnot participate in peace talks sceduled for Nov. 20-21 in Caracas,Venezuela. They said Cristiani's rightist government was notnegotiating seriously and blamed it for the Oct. 31 bombing of aunion headquarters that killed 10 people and wounded 29. TwoAmericans were among the wounded.   El Salvador is under a rebel-declared traffic ban, a state ofsiege and 6 p.m.-6 a.m. curfew. The army ordered a 24-hour curfewon embattled districts in San Salvador.   U.S.-supplied Skymaster propeller planes were seen firingrockets at residential areas in Zacamil and in Soyapango, aneastern suburb of the capital.   Helicopter gunships strafed rebel-held positions. Someneighborhoods were sealed off by government troops but in otherdistricts there were only rebel units.   In Zacamil, where five-story apartment buildings rise abovesquatters' shacks, the FMLN contingent was led by ClaudioRabindranath Armijo, who uses the war name Commander Chico.   Some fighters were as young as 13, carrying AK-47 assaultrifles. Armijo was accompanied by a one-armed communicationsofficer with a field radio.   Although the rebels' military domination of Zacamil was solid,their political control was not.   Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of residents remained in theneighborhood, aiding the guerrillas, but hundreds of others fledthe community.   Armijo said rebel commanders were trying to persuade the peopleto support them but those who didn't were free to leave.   Col. Arturo Lopez, an armed forces spokesman, described theresidents of northern suburbs as hostages of ``terrorist elements.''   He said as of Tuesday morning 309 guerrillas had been killed,160 wounded and 60 captured. He gave military casualties as 106killed and 231 wounded.   Lopez said the military had counted 17 civilians killed and 86wounded throughout the couuntry. But hospitals and morgues reported88 civilians killed and 662 wounded only in San Salvador since theoffensive began.   In a broadcast on the rebels' clandestine Radio Venceremos, theFMLN declared parts of eight provinces ``liberated zones.'' It saidlocal governments would be established in areas of Chalatenango,Morazan, San Miguel, La Union, Usulutan, Cuscatlan, San Vicente andCabanas provinces. The guerrillas have controlled areas in thoseprovinces for years.   FMLN leaders have said in the past they could not expect abattlefield victory over the U.S.-backed government. They have anestimated 7,000 guerrillas and 11,000 irregulars fighting thegovernment's 56,000-member security forces.   The Salvadoran conflict has taken 70,000 lives the last decade.</TEXT></DOC>
