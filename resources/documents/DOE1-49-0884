The microcomputer-basedIntegrated Reliability and Risk Analysis System (IRRAS) and the SystemAnalysis and Risk Assessment (SARA) System, under development at theIdaho National Engineering Laboratory, have greatly enhanced the abilityof managers to use PRA techniques in their decision-making. IRRAS isa tool that allows an analyst to create, modify, update, and reanalyzea plant PRA to keep the risk assessment current with the plant's configurationand operation. The SARA system is used to perform sensitivity studieson the results of a PRA. This type of analysis can be used to evaluateproposed changes to a plant or its operation. The success of these twosoftware projects demonstrates that risk information can be made readilyavailable to those that need it. This is the first step in the developmentof a true risk management capability.</TEXT></DOC>
