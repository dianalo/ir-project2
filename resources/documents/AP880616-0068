(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two pairs of red wolves that were releasedinto the wilderness have produced pups _ a milestone in wildlifeofficials' efforts to reintroduce the species into its naturalhabitat, authorities say.   The sightings of two wolf pups mark the first time that aspecies previously extinct in the wild has successfully producedoffspring after being returned to its natural environment, saidMichael Phillips, a biologist at the Alligator River NationalWildlife Refuge near Manteo.   The animals have been declared extinct in the wild since 1980.   ``One pup has been seen six or seven times with its mother,''Phillips said. ``Then we spotted another of the females with a pupthis past Saturday. This is great. It shows just how well theanimals have adapted.''   Phillips said the first pup appeared to be about six weeks old;the second about five weeks. Both appeared to be healthy.   Alhough litters usually average five or six pups, there havebeen no sightings to indicate that more than one survived fromeither of the two litters, Phillips said.   But Warren Parker, the coordinator for the U.S. Fish andWildlife Service's red wolf project, was more hopeful. ``We can'tconfirm it but we think there might be more pups that survived inthe second litter,'' Parker told the News and Observer of Raleigh.   ``There are many hazards out there for a young pup toconfront,'' Parker said. ``Rattlesnakes, diseases, parasiteproblems _ all sorts of things. It's a pretty hostile environment.''   Parker said the second female had recently moved her litterafter her mate was hit by a car and killed May 29. ``Generally themales provide the food for the first few weeks,'' he said. ``Withhis death she's had to handle it all, so she just found a betterlocation.''   After the pups are 7 months old, they'll get radio transmitters,similar to the ones worn by the adult wolves to keep track of them.   A vast population of red wolves once roamed the Southeast butteetered near extinction in the late 1970s. In 1978, the last purered wolves were taken from the wild to a Tacoma, Wash., zoo, wherebreeding in captivity encouraged biologists to try reintroducingthe animals into the wild.   Since September 1987, four pairs of wolves have been released inthe Alligator Refuge in coastal North Carolina. In addition to thedeath of the male wolf, two females have apparently died of naturalcauses.</TEXT></DOC>
