The Commerce Department said orders climbed by 3.1% in the month, after a 3.6% decline in July and a 5.4% increase in June.    Federal Reserve officials have been counting on some slowdown in economic growth to ward off an acceleration of inflation. Other economic indicators, such as business hiring and consumer spending, suggest a modest slowdown is at hand, but the increase in factory orders casts doubt on that conclusion.    Manufacturers booked $226.64 billion in new orders in August, compared with $219.88 billion in July. A surge in orders for transportation equipment more than offset a decline in orders for chemicals, petroleum, textiles and apparel.    &quot;Manufacturers don't see any slowing of their order picture across a broad spectrum of industries,&quot; said Jerry Jasinowski, economist for the National Association of Manufacturers.    Factory orders sometimes fluctuate substantially from month to month, but the August increase is supported by other measures. A recent survey of more than 70 members of the manufacturers' association found three-quarters of them expect bookings to continue to be as strong for the next two quarters as they are currently. And an otherwise bearish monthly survey by the National Association of Purchasing Managers, released over the weekend, also showed strength in new orders.    Separately, the Commerce Department said construction spending declined 0.6% in August after a 0.7% increase in July. In the first eight months of the year, construction spending was off 0.6% before taking inflation into account.    The department said orders for non-durable goods slipped 0.1% in August after rising 1.1% the month before. The agency said the rubber, plastics, paper and tobacco industries reported stronger orders. The chemical, petroleum, textile and apparel industries reported weaker orders.    Tom Runiewicz of WEFA Group, a Bala Cynwyd, Pa., forecasting firm, said the drop in orders for chemicals was surprising, considering the industry's recent strength. Chemicals and related products, including drugs and toiletries, account for about 20% of all shipments of non-durable goods. The department said chemical industry shipments were off 1.9% in August.    Orders for durable goods, those intended to last more than three years, were up 5.9% in August after falling 7.4% in July. In an estimate issued last week, the department put the August increase at 6%.    Excluding new orders for transportation equipment, which swing widely from month to month, factory orders rose a modest 0.6% in August and 0.1% in July. Orders for transportation equipment were up 19% in August after falling 22.5% in July. A large part of the increase was in autos, as the department said in last week's report.    Factory shipments rose 2.1% in August to $221.29 billion after falling 1% in July and rising 1.4% in June. Shipments of durable goods rose 4.3%, and shipments of non-durables fell 0.3%.    Manufacturers' inventories rose 0.5% in August to $345.56 billion after rising 0.5% in July and 0.6% in June. At the end of the month, manufacturers had enough inventory to fill 1.56 months of orders, down from 1.59 in July.    Backlogs of unfilled orders rose 1.2% in August to $451.89 billion after climbing 0.7% in July and 2.1% in June.    The department said construction spending in August was at an annual rate of $396.1 billion, down from $398.3 billion in July. Spending in July was up 0.7%   Residential construction spending, which accounts for nearly half of all construction activity, was up 0.7%. Other private construction spending was down 1.8%. Public construction spending was off 2.1%.    All the figures are adjusted for seasonal fluctuations but not for inflation.    Adjusted for inflation, total construction spending was off 0.5% in August and was up 0.2% in July, the Commerce Department said.
