Long-term exposure to cancer-causing substances in theworkplace, for example, is blamed for about 16,000 lung cancerdeaths a year, the association said in its 1987 annual report.   That is about 12 percent of the nation's total lung cancerdeaths last year, the association said.   Among the workplace substances that cause lung cancer arearsenic, a hazard in the oil refining, smelting and miningindustries; asbestos, in asbestos milling and manufacture,insulation and shipyard work; chromium, used in glassmaking,potting and battery making; nickel, in nickel refining, andpetroleum products and oils, the association said.   Not everyone in those industries is exposed to those substances,however, the association noted.   Other job-related lung diseases include chronic bronchitis, astiffening of lung tissue called pulmonary fibrosis and industrialasthma, the association said.   On other topics, the annual report said smokers who kick thehabit have to wait 10 years or more before their risk of lungcancer falls to about that of people who have never smoked.   But that should not discourage smokers from quitting, becausequitting causes an immediate and dramatic plunge in the risk ofother diseases, especially emphysema and chronic bronchitis, thereport says.   The report also calls lung cancer statistics on blacks``horrendous,'' resulting from higher percentages of smokers amongblack men and women than among whites.   In 1985, about 41 percent of black men aged 20 and older smoked,compared to about 32 percent for white men, while about 32 percentof black women smoked, compared to 28 percent of white women, theassociation said.   From 1973 to 1984, the lung cancer death rate among black menrose 25 percent, from 64.3 deaths per 100,000 population to 80.3,three times faster than the rate among white men, the associationsaid in a separate statement.   For black women the death rate nearly doubled, from 11.9 per100,000 population to 20.4, the association said.</TEXT></DOC>
