Bush, meantime, reiterated his promise to make the Cabinetrepresentative of women and minorities. ``Stay tuned,'' he toldreporters.   The vice president continued his string of meetings with variousinterest groups. He spent about 30 minutes with Benjamin Hooks ofthe NAACP before a session with 13 conservatives, including EdwinFeulner Jr., president of the Heritage Foundation, and Paul Weyrichof the Free Congress Foundation.   Feulner said the conservatives urged Bush to place people oftheir philosophical bent in high positions.   ``In effect what we urged was that he make sure that all parts ofthe (conservative) coalition continue to have a stake in his successonce he becomes president,'' he said.   Bush was also encouraged to make greater use of his veto power toprevent an ``erosion of power'' from the executive branch.Conservatives do not want to see Congress attain too much power,particularly in foreign affairs, Weyrich said.   Also among the conservatives on Bush's schedule was RobertWoodson, a black businessman from North Carolina who has beenmentioned as a possible secretary of housing and urban development.Rep. Jack Kemp, R-N.Y., is thought to have the inside track for thatjob.   Hooks, a Democrat, said his meeting with Bush was ``verycordial.'' The two discussed personnel appointments in all levels ofgovernment and the judiciary, as well as issues of concern toblacks, he said.   Asked whether Bush had made a commitment to place a black in theCabinet, Hooks replied: ``To the best of my recollection, I think Ido remember him saying there would be a black in the Cabinet.''Hooks then said he had a ``distinct recollection that he said heintends to do that.''   Bush has named about a dozen people to top jobs in hisadministration so far, only one of them female and none of themblack.   Hooks, a vocal critic of the Reagan administration's civil rightspolicies, said he was confident that his group would have betterrelations with Bush.   ``I expect a much better civil rights record from Mr. Bush,'' hesaid.   Hooks said he asked Bush to think about convening a White Houseconference on race and poverty next year, an idea he said Bushpromised to consider.   Meantime, Robert Teeter, co-director of the Bush transitionoffice, said he still was trying to decide whether to accept thepost of deputy White House chief of staff under John Sununu, butthat he has been assured direct access to Bush if he does take it.   Teeter, whose polling data and strategy advice helped propel Bushto victory in November, said he will decide in ``the next few days''whether to take the job or return to his home in Michigan with hiswife and two children. ``I don't know what I'm going to do yet,'' hesaid in a telephone interview.   In talks with Bush, he said, it has been agreed that he couldfill the dual role of presidential counselor and deputy chief ofstaff.</TEXT></DOC>
