The intent, Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries sources said, would be to hold prices at least in the current range of $10 to $14 a barrel by reducing the cartel's production, which has been climbing since summer and is now nearing 21 million barrels a day.    But, as it seems to be evolving, the plan would include a return to OPEC production quotas that would be higher than the current -- and widely ignored -- theoretical ceiling of 17.5 million barrels a day.    What's more, most of the 13 oil exporters, including several Arab producers blamed for much of the overproduction, would receive bigger individual quotas. That would increase the OPEC ceiling to as much as 18.5 million barrels a day for the remainder of the year and perhaps to as much as 19 million barrels a day for 1989.    There isn't any assurance, of course, that such a plan would work any better than past OPEC efforts to prop up the price of oil. Nor is it known whether it will be acceptable to all 13 member nations, including the former war foes of Iraq and Iran. But Saudi Arabia, the OPEC kingpin, is said to be supporting it, and it is due to be given serious consideration at a series of meetings of the oil exporters beginning next week and carrying through November.    OPEC's new secretary-general, Subroto, the former oil minister of Indonesia, is understood to be one of the architects of the proposal. But Subroto, who spoke yesterday to a London oil conference sponsored by the International Herald Tribune and the Oil Daily, didn't make any references to it. He did say, however, that OPEC hasn't &quot;resigned itself to accepting the decline in oil prices as a fait accompli.&quot;    Also, in answer to a question, Subroto said the current high level of OPEC output &quot;is an unnatural situation.&quot; He said output should be reduced to a level that would provide an acceptable price.    &quot;Therefore, what we are going to do,&quot; he said, &quot;is to bring it back to a level we agreed upon in December 1986 and continued in December 1987 and then . . . adjust it&quot; to the indicated demand for OPEC oil. Most industry estimates are that this demand will average around 18.5 million barrels a day in the current quarter, about two million to 2.5 million barrels a day below current OPEC output.    Although OPEC's chief spokesman insisted that the cartel is still determined to return eventually to its benchmark of $18 a barrel, other speakers at the conference called the target price &quot;unachievable.&quot; They agreed that most OPEC members prefer to produce more even if this means lower prices. &quot;OPEC cannot survive much longer as a market manager without sustained volume growth,&quot; Alirio A. Parra, a Petroleos de Venezuela official, told the conference.    Industry officials, meantime, cited a meeting of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council that begins Sunday in Saudi Arabia as being crucial to anticipated OPEC developments. There are early signs that Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, three important members of the GCC, will reach an agreement that will allow them to go to next week's &quot;strategy&quot; meeting of eight leading OPEC countries in Madrid with a new position.    &quot;The GCC meeting is critical -- important as a stepping stone. It will be an early indication of what will come&quot; at Madrid, said Lawrence Goldstein, executive vice president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, in New York.    Mr. Goldstein said any agreement that might be reached will be vague, or tentative -- &quot;an attempt to hold the market together so there's no collapse in oil prices&quot; between now and the full ministerial meeting of OPEC in November. &quot;OPEC must convince the market that it is dealing with its problems,&quot; he said.    It is believed that the Saudis and Iraq, which currently excludes itself from OPEC's production curbs, have already come to terms regarding quotas. Sources said Iraq has agreed to return to a quota, albeit much higher than its former 1.3 million barrels a day. Iran and Iraq would be given production parity, with each allowed to produce about 2.5 million barrels a day, OPEC sources said. Iran's current quota is 2.4 million barrels.    To make this work, however, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, which are among OPEC's major overproducers, will also have their official quotas boosted. And this arrangement, even if acceptable to everyone in Madrid, might only be temporary.    Industry officials familiar with the Arab stance in OPEC said it is imperative that an agreement is reached at the GCC meeting. One official likened the recent bickering of cartel members to &quot;13 male birds fighting in a cage -- soon they will have no feathers.&quot; Said another official: &quot;If they can't see what's happening in Algeria, then God help them&quot; -- a reference to the riots said to have been caused by low oil prices which have devastated that OPEC country.    Robert Neumann, a former U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia, suggested the Algerian developments may have led to a softening in the kingdom's own overproduction strategy. &quot;The situation in Algeria, which is influential in diplomatic circles, has reached a point that is worrisome,&quot; Mr. Neumann said. &quot;Saudi Arabia just can't ride roughshod over a country like Algeria. It wants to keep good relations with other Arab countries.&quot;    Nevertheless, sources close to the Saudis said the kingdom continues to exceed its OPEC production quota of 4.3 million barrels a day in line with its recently hardened position against other overproducers in OPEC. Some said its output may reach six million barrels this month. &quot;We will continue our {high} production until these fellows {other OPEC quota violators} come to their senses,&quot; one Saudi said. </TEXT></DOC>
