Joseph R. Biden Jr., saying he is ``alittle wiser ... more serene'' returned to the Senate Wednesday,nearly seven months after he underwent emergency brain surgery torepair an aneurysm.   Looking tanned and trim as he stepped off the train fromWilmington, Del., Biden plunged into a busy first day, attending asurprise party in his office, talking with reporters, chairing aForeign Relations subcommittee hearing on presidential war powers,and voting in the Senate.   Later, the Senate put aside business on a textile bill to paytribute to Biden.   With Biden's parents, wife, children and other relatives lookingon from the gallery, the Senate voted unanimously to welcome himback and gave him a standing ovation. A parade of senators fromboth parties took the floor to praise Biden, including 87-year-oldJohn Stennis, D-Miss., who had been a fellow hospital patient.   ``Having friends make a difference. Having a place you want tobe makes a difference,'' Biden said in an emotional thank-youspeech.   ``I'm more happy to be back than you can imagine,'' the45-year-old senator told his staff, which had draped his office inballoons and ``Welcome Back, Senator'' banners.   Biden, who last year was a candidate for the Democraticpresidential nomination later captured by Massachusetts Gov.Michael Dukakis, reflected on the 12-month period that took himfrom the campaign trail to the hospital.   Biden said his withdrawal from the race ``saved my life. Mydoctors told me the prospects of my still being alive if I stayedin the presidential race were very remote.   ``There is no way I would have been the candidate,'' Biden said.``I either would have died or been in the hospital.''   Biden also said he bore no grudge against the Dukakis aide whoseleaked reports to the press helped end Biden's campaign.   John Sasso, who was fired by Dukakis and then recently rehired,had given reporters information that Biden had taken quotes from aBritish politician and used them, unattributed, in his own speeches.   ``Any personal feeling disappeared between the first aneurysmand the blood clot,'' Biden joked, adding that he would work forDukakis in this fall's presidential campaign.   Biden was hospitalized last February, complaining of neck painand nausea. A middle-of-the-night emergency transfer brought Bidenfrom a hospital in Wilmington to Walter Reed Army Medical Center inWashington. Hours later, he was operated on for an aneurysm in anartery supplying blood to his brain.   Another, smaller, aneurysm was found and Biden underwentadditional surgery on May 3.   Looking back over the year, Biden said ``I hope than I'm alittle wiser. I think I have a somewhat more serene outlook _ not asense of urgency.''   ``I thought a lot about whether I wanted to stay in thisbusiness,'' Biden said of his lengthy recuperation. ``I like what Ido. I'm very good at what I do ... It made me eager to get back todo my job.''   Biden was welcomed back by Senate Majority Leader Robert C.Byrd, D-W.Va., and Republican Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.   ``We've greatly missed his leadership, his counsel, his warmsense of humor over the past months,'' Byrd said. ``But you canalways count on Senator Biden to overcome any adversity.''   ``Joe had a tough time of it over the past seven months,'' Dolesaid. ``But to the surprise of no one who knows Joe Biden's spiritand tenacity, he triumphed.''</TEXT></DOC>
