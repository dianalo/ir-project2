Commercials with catchy jingles appear regularly on Israelitelevision urging viewers to ``come enjoy the quality of life'' inthe occupied Gaza Strip, where 2,500 Jews live in 15 settlementsthat are surrounded by more than 650,000 Palestinians.   ``This isn't a place people usually come to visit,'' said DatyaHerskovitz, a settlement coordinator for the Gush Katif region insouthern Gaza. ``We're just offering to show people what's reallyhappening here.''   The upbeat advertising campaign, which features cheerful thememusic and children playing soccer in tidy neighborhoods, portraysthe settler enclaves as wholesome places to raise a family. ``Livein a young effervescent community,'' says one newspaper ad.   The ads don't mention the year-old uprising, which has claimedthe lives of more than 300 Palestinians and 11 Israelis.   ``We're not trying to ignore reality,'' Ms. Herskovitz said in aninterview. ``We just want people to take a different look at Gaza.''   The 25-mile-long stretch of desert has been a focal point ofanti-Israeli violence since the uprising began in Gaza's refugeecamps last December.   Jewish settlers have demanded more protection from Israel's armyagainst Arab stone-throwers. Thirty-one civilians in Gaza have beenwounded in stone-throwing attacks since the start of the uprising.   Ms. Herskovitz said the long-term goal of the $50,000 promotionaldrive is to help boost the territory's outnumbered Jewish populationfrom 3,000 to 30,000 during the next 10 years.   The ads, placed by the government and private agencies, are partof an annual campaign to increase settlement in the occupied land,with this year's effort focused on Gaza.   Some backers of the ad campaign admit it isn't easy to sell theidea of moving to Gaza during the uprising.   Eli Kubasi, a spokesman for the World Zionist Organization, saidsettlement leaders who hope for a Jewish population boom in Gazaduring the uprising have ``set their expectations too high.''   ``Things were easier before the intefadeh,'' Kubasi said, usingthe Arabic word for uprising. ``Now people think twice about whetherthey want to live there.''   Dedi Zucker, a leader of the left-wing Citizens Rights Movement,said encouraging more settlers could undermine future efforts toexchange portions of the occupied territories for a peace agreementwith Israel's Arab enemies.   The United States also has called the 130 settlements in theoccupied West Bank and Gaza Strip obstacles to peace.   The settlements in the West Bank, some almost commuter suburbs,are far more popular than those in Gaza, which are far from Israel'smain population centers.   Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan and the Gaza Strip fromEgypt during the 1967 Middle East war. Prior to the war,Palestinians fleeing Israel flocked to Gaza's overcrowded refugeecamps.   The Israeli government built the first settlements in southernGaza in 1967 as a buffer against the Egyptian border and ongoingPalestinian attacks. Other enclaves and a beach resort for settlershave been put up since.   Few settlements have been built in the past four years becausethe left-leaning Labor Party and right-wing Likud bloc, which makeup the current joint government, disagree on settlement policies andwere unwilling to provide funds.   Zucker said the ad campaign was ``totally unrealistic'' and awaste of government funding that could be put to better use withinIsrael's pre-1967 borders.   ``It's difficult to understand why anyone would want to live inthe middle of all that craziness,'' Zucker said in an interview. ``Iguess we'll have to wait to see how many lunatics there are.''   But Ms. Herskovitz, the settlement coordinator, said the Gazasettlements would grow despite the uprising.   ``We decided this was the time to go on TV because we're readyfor more people,'' she said. ``The sole purpose of this is to bringmore families to live with us.''</TEXT></DOC>
