Albert Gore says Democratic presidentialrival Rep. Richard Gephardt has made ``wholesale changes in dozensand dozens of key positions,'' but Gephardt claims it is Gore whohas reversed himself on a dozen issues of prime importance.   The bickering between the two Democratic hopefuls turned up anotch on Monday with Gephardt's campaign laying down a list of whatit said were 12 major Gore position changes.   ``It's hypocrisy,'' said Gephardt spokesman Mark Johnson ofGore's attacks. But Gore kept up his volleys, saying the Missouricongressman votes one way in Congress and is telling the voterssomething different.   The Tennessee senator said Gephardt's ``whole approach to theelectorate is in contrast to the approach during his career in theCongress.''   And Gore spokeswoman Arlie Schardt took aim at the Gephardtcampaign's depiction of Gore position changes.   ``It's misleading and an almost laughable list,'' Schardt said.``It reveals their anxiety about being so deeply in debt and aboutseeing Gore surging past them'' in recent polls.   On the politically explosive issue of abortion, Gephardt's aidessaid Gore voted in 1984 for legislation that would have defined afetus as a ``person'' from the moment of conception _ a change inthe law that has been key goal of the anti-abortion movement.   On Sunday, Gore denied voting for such an amendment.   ``No, no, I did not,'' Gore said on NBC's ``Meet the Press.''``I have never supported restrictions on the ability of the womanto make a choice in having an abortion.''   Gore's staff said the Gephardt campaign is describing the voteincorrectly. They say it was a vote designed to deny the use offederal funds for abortion _ a longtime Gore position _ and not anattempt to write the definition of a fetus into the law in such away that would deny women the right to choose abortions.   The Gephardt campaign also listed four other times it said Gorehad voted on both sides of the abortion issue in the House andSenate.   ``I have not changed my position at all,'' Gore said Monday.``There is no inconsistency at all.''   Gephardt has been severely criticized for backing down from hisstrong opposition to abortion, a change that came as he wasplanning his bid for the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination.   The Gephardt sheet also said Gore voted for the Harkin amendmentto the agriculture bill in 1985, which Gephardt aides saidcontained production controls almost identical to theHarkin-Gephardt farm bill. Gore now attacks the Harkin-Gephardtbill.   Gore said Monday that the 1985 amendment was ``the onlyalternative'' to the Reagan-sponsored farm bill and he said themeasures are different. On Sunday, Gore termed the latest bill``the worst single idea of campaign '88.''   There are ten other issues on which the Gephardt campaign saidGore had flip-flopped. Gore aides said the list misconstrued voteafter vote.   Here are the ten:   _ Balanced budget amendment: Gephardt statement says Gore votedagainst it in the House in 1982 and for it in 1986 in the Senate.   _ Non-lethal Contra aid: Gephardt release says Gore votedagainst such aid in 1985, but now says he favors it.   _ MX missile: Gephardt statement says Gore voted for the MX in1983, but now says he is against further MX funding.   _ Defense policy: Gephardt release says Gore voted for thenuclear freeze in 1983 and was ``a respected advocate for theliberal peace agenda.'' Now Gephardt campaign says Gore``positioned himself as a defense hawk.''   _ Grain embargo against the Soviet Union: Gephardt release saysGore voted against ending the embargo in 1980, but not criticizesembargo.   _ Oil import fee: Gephardt statement says Gore voted against itin 1980, 1985 and 1986, but told Texas voters in 1987 he wouldconsider one.   _ Gramm-Rudman: Gephardt release says Gore voted for it in theSenate and then against legislation that would have rewritten thelaw to solve constitutional questions raised by the Supreme Court.   _ Trade: Gephardt statement says Gore declared himself a``free-trade purist'' in 1987, but had previously voted for atextile protection bill.   _ Litmus tests: Gephardt release says Gore denounced litmustests of special interest groups, but that he pledged to theNational Women's Political Caucus in August 1987 he would namewomen to 50 percent of his presidential slots.   _ Supreme Court: Gephardt statement says Gore quickly came outagainst the appointment of William Rehnquist as Chief Justice, butthat Gore was the last senator to announce he would vote againstthe by-then-doomed nomination of Robert Bork to the high court.</TEXT></DOC>
