The violence eased toward dawn, enabling police to reduce theirpresence.   The riots, which began Monday night in the Overtown sectionfollowing the shooting death of a black motoryclist by a policeofficer there, spread to the Liberty City neighborhood Tuesday. Theviolence, which broke out as Miami made final preparations forSunday's Super Bowl, forced the cancellation of a NationalBasketball Association game Tuesday night.   ``Things have quieted a lot since about 2 a.m.,'' said policespokesman David Rivero. ``We have pulled back some of theblockades.''   Rivero said some sections of Overtown's business district werestill closed to traffic at 6:30 a.m., but most roads were open inthe mostly residential Liberty City area.   Two fires were burning in Liberty City at dawn, including achurch that was being allowed to burn to the ground, Rivero said.   The U.S. Justice Department began an investigation of thecyclist's shooting, which led to the death of the man's passengerafter the motorcyle crashed. The city also was investigating theshooting; the City Council convened for an emergency session today.   ``For the sake of our city, I appeal to every citizen, regardlessof race to stay calm, get off the streets and stay in your homes,''said Mayor Xavier Suarez in a televised appeal Tuesday night.   Police, who earlier had stood by to protect lives and property,took a more assertive role late Tuesday, arresting troublemakers. Byearly today, 250 arrests had been made, mostly for burglaries, saidpolice Sgt. Michael Mazur. The suspects were being held at the DadeCounty Jail pending bail hearings, according to a jail spokeswomanwho would not give her name.   The 1{ square mile Overtown section and a small part of LibertyCity were cordoned off by police. The decision to sweep through theareas and make arrests came after sniping incidents increased,police said.   In Liberty City, northwest of Overtown, a 16-year-old black youthwas killed late Tuesday in a shooting apparently unrelated to therioting. Metro-Dade police Sgt. John Roper said Troy Robinson wasshot to death during an argument over a stolen check-printingmarchine. Howard Scippio, 37, of Miami, was arrested and chargedwith first-degree murder.   In Overtown, just north of downtown, two people were shotTuesday, one of them in the leg by police. Five others were shot inLiberty City, including a police officer who was wearing abulletproof vest and was not seriously injured by sniper fire.   A white man in a luxury car fired a gun into a crowd ofrock-throwing blacks early Tuesday afternoon, wounding a 19-year-oldman who was hospitalized in fair condition.   Gunfire and rock-throwing in the area of Miami Arena, which is inOvertown, forced the postponement of Tuesday night's NBA gamebetween the Miami Heat and Phoenix Suns.   A meat truck, furniture stores and several smaller stores werelooted, Mazur said. The Liberty City community center was set ablazeas were at least a half dozen other buildings.   A white motorist whose car broke down was beaten but managed torun toward police for protection, and an Associated Pressphotographer was roughed up by a mob and his car torched.   ``I saw someone coming around a building and throwing rocks, andI said `Let's go, get out of here,''' said photographer MarkPesetsky, who escaped after police fired tear gas at the crowd.   At least two other beatings were reported, and several peoplewere treated for lacerations, Jackson Memorial Hospital officialssaid.   Police worked 17-hour shifts and ran out of riot bags, equippedwith a gas mask, shield, baton, helmet and handcuffs. Weary officersarrived at Miami police headquarters downtown, hoping for a respitein the violence.   Most Miamians remained unaffected by the rioting, which wasconfined to a relatively small portion of the central city.   The closest many got to the riot scene was on Interstate 95,which passes over the western edge of Overtown, or on the DolphinExpressway, which intersects I-95 near the troubled area. Motoristscould see and smell smoke from fires set by rioters and there wereisolated incidents of rocks and bottles being thrown at cars.   The violence erupted following the shooting death of 23-year-oldClement Anthony Lloyd during a police pursuit. A passenger on themotorcycle, Allen Blanchard, 24, died Tuesday.   Lloyd was shot in the head by Officer William Lozano, a four-yearpolice veteran who was investigating an unrelated incident whenLloyd sped by, authorities said.   Lloyd and Blanchard were unarmed and were being pursued for aspeeding violation, said police spokesman Angelo Bitsis.   Within hours, a mob of blacks surrounded the crash scene andbegan throwing rocks and bottles.   Lozano, 29, a Colombian immigrant who had been on the squad forthree years, was automatically suspended with pay pending aninvestigation.   The U.S. Justice Department ordered the FBI to investigate theshooting.   Suarez also promised an investigation and said he would name anindependent review panel of private citizens, who could meet asearly as today.   ``We will not rest until we come to the bottom of what happenedto spark this riot,'' Suarez added.   School officials said six Overtown schools closed after the firstnight of riots would reopen today.   Overtown is about 15 miles from Joe Robbie Stadium, site of theSuper Bowl. The Cincinnati Bengals, who play the San Francisco 49ersin the National Football League championship game, are staying lessthan a mile from Overtown, at the Omni Hotel.   Some community leaders blamed the violence on what is perceivedin the black community as favoritism toward Hispanic refugees.   ``In this tremendous influx of refugees from Central and SouthAmerica, the African-Americans have felt cheated. We felt we werelosing our place in the city,'' said Johnnie McMillian, president ofthe Miami-Dade branch of the National Association for theAdvancement of Colored People.   The violence recalled bloody riots in Liberty City in 1980 andOvertown in 1982 following incidents in which black men were shot todeath by police.</TEXT></DOC>
