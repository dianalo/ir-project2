(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Smaller is better in the case of whatresearchers are calling the world's fastest and most powerfulsupercomputer.   The machine, dedicated Tuesday at the von Neumann NationalSupercomputer Center near Princeton, will be about 170,000 timesfaster than the best home computers, yet small enough so that itsmain components could slide inside a briefcase.   By the middle of next year, after four more processors areadded, it will be able to handle more than 10 billion calculationsa second, a capacity greater than any other computer, said Carl S.Ledbetter, president of ETA Systems Inc., the computer'sMinnesota-based manufacturer.   Researchers are expected to use the ETA10 computer to advancescientific discovery in fields like aerospace engineering, weatherforecasting and pharmaceuticals.   ``By expanding the computational power of our facilities in rawspeed and scope, we intend to inspire researchers to tackle a newgenre of complex problems only supercomputers can efficientlysolve,'' said Doyle D. Knight, a Rutgers University engineeringprofessor and president of the consortium that manages the center.   Ledbetter said the computer is the product of severaltechnological advances.   It has smaller, denser computer chips than its predecessor, anduses copper ``tracings'' instead of miles of conventional wire.This reduces the space electrons have to travel, enabling fastercalculations, Ledbetter said.   In another advancement, the circuits are dipped in supercoolliquid nitrogen, enabling the electrons to move at an even fasterpace.   This generates less heat than other semi-conductor technology,allowing the computer's designers to make ETA10 even smallerbecause ``when things are cooler you can put them closertogether,'' Ledbetter said.   ``One of the ironies of these supercomputers is that they arevery small,'' Ledbetter said.   The ``brain'' of the ETA10, which will cost $25 million to $30million, will be eight processors, each 16-by-22-by-.25 inches. Thefirst four processors were delivered to the von Neumann Center inMarch and have been operating for several weeks.   The four-processor computer can now handle 3.4 billionarithmetic calculations per second, making it one of the world'sfastest supercomputers, Ledbetter said.   According to researchers, the supercomputer will enable them toattack problems too complex for earlier generations ofsupercomputers to handle in any reasonable length of time. Onereason is that the new computer will be able to handle many morevariables at the same time, Ledbetter said.   At a news conference Tuesday, researchers demonstrated adetailed, three-dimensional model of a protein molecule that tookthe ETA10 two hours to create. It would have taken an average homecomputer more than a year to do the task, one researcher said.   ``Some of the things that can be done include very sophisticatedweather-modeling programs. They can do three- and four- andseven-day forecasts much more accurately than had ever been donebefore,'' Ledbetter said.   The center, one of five national supercomputer centers, ismanaged by the Consortium for Scientific Computing Inc., consistingof the University of Arizona, the University of Pennsylvania, theUniversity of Colorado, the University of Rochester, theMassachusetts Institute of Technology, the Institute for AdvancedStudy and Brown, Columbia, Harvard, Princeton, Penn State, New Yorkand Rutgers universities.   Researchers from those schools will be able to use thesupercomputer from their campuses.   The center was established in 1985 with a commitment of $69.2million in funding from the National Science Foundation and $12.1million from the New Jersey Commission on Science and Technology.</TEXT></DOC>
