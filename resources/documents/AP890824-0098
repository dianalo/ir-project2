William O'Hare, director of policy studies at the PopulationReference Bureau, also predicted that ``there is going to be amountain of litigation'' following the census over issues such asadjustments for undercounted minorities, whether or not to excludeillegal aliens and inclusion of military personnel overseas in thecount used for reapportionment.   ``We think that the redistricting in the 1990s offers a lot ofopportunities and a few potential pitfalls,'' O'Hare told a newsconference. ``Clearly, there's room for more election ofminorities.''   In the 1991-92 reapportionment, O'Hare said, ``the states thatare likely to gain the most congressional seats _ for example,California, Texas, Florida _ all have large minority populations.''   He said the country's Hispanic population was expected to show aparticularly strong gain, from about 14.5 million in 1980 up to aprojected 22 million in the 1990 census _ with most of the increaseconcentrated in sunbelt states.   Asked what net gain of minority members he expects there will bein the House, O'Hare said: ``Certainly half a dozen to 10 is notunreasonable. ... I would say that's optimistic, but notoutlandishly optimistic.''   The 435-seat House now has 36 minority members _ 22 blacks, nineHispanics, four Asian-Americans and one American Indian.   He said that currently blacks make up about 12 percent of theU.S. population but have only 1.5 percent of elected officials,while Hispanics comprise 8 percent of the population but are lessthan 2 percent of elected officials across the country.   O'Hare released cpies of a new Population Reference Bureaureport, ``Redistricting in the 1990s: A Guide for Minority Groups,''that was funded by the Ford Foundation and includes chapters writtenby eight experts in minority demographics and politics.   The Washington-based Population Reference Bureau describes itselfas a private, non-partisan organization which aims to increasepublic awareness and understanding of population issues.</TEXT></DOC>
