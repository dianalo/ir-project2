As in the past, Texas Sandamp;Ls, suffering from a depressed regionaleconomy, contributed the bulk of the savings industry's losses.Texas thrifts lost $2.2 billion, although that was a 38 percentimprovement over the same period in 1988.   Seventy-three percent of Sandamp;Ls nationally earned a profit _ $1.3billion. But that was swamped by $4.7 billion in losses at the 27percent that lost money.   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board reported that losses by the2,938 Sandamp;Ls worsened from the revised $3.2 billion in the final threemonths of 1988.   Meanwhile, profits at the 13,001 commercial banks hit a recordlevel for the third straight quarter, up from $6.7 billion in thefinal three months of last year.   The bank board revised its previously reported Sandamp;L loss total forall of last year, adding $900 million to bring 1988 red ink to apost-Depression record of $13 billion.   ``The thrift industry will be plagued by continuing losses,''predicted economist Paul Getman of The WEFA Group, a Bala Cynwyd,Pa., consulting firm. ``Not only are property values in some areasstill falling, but thrifts have been squeezed (because) their costof funds have been rising faster than their mortgage rates.''   James R. Barth, chief economist of the bank board, said heavy Sandamp;Llosses would continue until Congress enacts President Bush's bailoutbill.   ``No legislation, no new funds, is not the best way to deal withopen but insolvent institutions,'' he said.   Barth said the more than 200 institutions rescued last year withgovernment assistance contributed $145 million in profits, but, hesaid, about 10 of those institutions were losing money.   Reporting on commercial banks, the Federal Deposit InsuranceCorp. said profits rose in 42 states and the District of Columbiaand declined in eight states and Puerto Rico. New England, inparticular, looked weaker, with profits slipping in Massachusetts,Connecticut and Maine.   Alex Sheshunoff, a financial industry analyst based in Austin,Texas, said he was concerned that banks have increased their realestate lending by 12.9 percent over a year ago while boostingcommercial lending by only 1.4 percent.   ``Real estate lending has been the Achilles' heel of the bankingindustry. We're beginning to see that deteriorate in theNortheast,'' he said.   Only one state, Texas, reported a loss for its banks. But its $13million in red ink was minuscule compared with a $1.7 billion netloss in the comparable 1988 quarter. Other oil-producing states _Alaska, Oklahoma and Louisiana _ also showed big improvements.   John Quinn, an FDIC analyst, attributed commercial banking'sstrong performance to a decline in bad loans, particularly in stateswest of the Mississippi River, an increase in loan income caused byrising interest rates, and success in controlling overhead expenses.   Unlike Sandamp;Ls, banks offer mostly short-term loans and can morequickly raise the interest rate they charge while at the same timeholding down rates paid to depositors. Compared with Sandamp;Ls, banks arehurt less, and sometimes helped, by rising interest rates.   Quinn said bad loans have declined particularly in farming statesand noted that institutions there so far have not suffered becauseof last year's drought.   Despite the profits, banks continued to fail at a high rate. TheFDIC, which insures deposits, said 93 banks have failed or requiredgovernment assistance so far this year, compared with 89 during thesame period in 1988. For all of last year, a post-Depression recordof 221 failed.   However, the number of ``problem banks'' has slipped to 1,289,the lowest level in three years, down from 1,491 a year ago.   Despite the failures last year, banks posted a record profit of$25.1 billion. That followed a post-Depression low in 1987 of $2.8billion, which was caused by large write-offs of Third World debt.   Getman said Argentina's problems in making payments on its $60billion in debt will likely begin hurting bank performance in thesecond and third quarters.   ``Obviously bank profits are very good, but they're not likely tostay that good this year,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
