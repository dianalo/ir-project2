Some analysts believe the trade bill could even kill off the long-sought free-trade pact between the U.S. and Canada.    It is hard to overstate the importance of trade to both countries. U.S. merchandise exports to Canada in 1985 were 25% of total U.S. exports and 81% of total Canadian imports. Canadian merchandise exports to the U.S. were 78% of total Canadian exports and 19% of total U.S. imports. Millions of jobs on both sides of the border depend on this trade.    While most goods going between the U.S. and Canada are duty-free, a free-trade agreement would gradually dismantle barriers to the rest, enhance trade in key service industries and reduce nationalist barriers against foreign investment.    To U.S. and Canadian trade negotiators the single most disturbing aspect of the trade bill is a provision passed by the House last April expanding U.S. retaliation against subsidies foreign governments give to their domestic industries. The Senate-passed trade bill doesn't include that provision, but it could be adopted by the conference committee appointed to iron out differences between the two versions.    The House bill would levy penalties against any &quot;competitive advantage in international commerce that would not exist but for government action.&quot; This would probably include Canada's regulated utility rates, support of public inland waterways and other highly indirect subsidies. Not only would such action invite European and Asian countries to retaliate against similar U.S. subsidies in areas such as aircraft and agriculture, but it could be used as a pretext by Canadian nationalists to kill the free-trade pact.    Ironically, some of the same U.S. senators pushing the misguided trade bill also express fervent support for the U.S.-Canada trade agreement. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen urged the president last November to make the talks a top priority. Senator Daniel P. Moynihan is a staunch supporter of an agreement.    We suspect that more than a few senators who back the trade bill hope privately that President Reagan will veto it, allowing them to reap credit for being &quot;tough&quot; on trade without inflicting any of the clear economic costs. Unfortunately, that kind of loose thinking helped bring about the infamous 1930 Smoot-Hawley tariffs, and could set off a world-wide trade war today. Moreover, a bad trade bill could erode the gains from an agreement with Canada, even if it exempted Canada from trade retaliation; neither country would be protected from the damage such legislation would cause.    The U.S. and Canada have long enjoyed some of the most amicable relations between any two countries in the world. The U.S.-Canadian border has been basically undefended since the Rush-Bagot Agreement of 1817. For the two nations to miss the chance to sign an accord further cementing their relationship would be extremely unfortunate. It would also send an ominous signal to world markets increasingly anxious about the spread of protectionism. </TEXT></DOC>
