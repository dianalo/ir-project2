In computer professionals realizing thattheir real job is to make users more productive.&quot;andM;After evolving with the industry for over 30 years -- in the private sector,government and consulting -- I can assure him that unless you aresuccessfully self-employed, real job security lies in not questioning thetechnical and product decisions made by top management, even though they maybe totally ridiculous and unworkable, but in making yourself indispensable --and being less than 40 years old.andM;I can assure you that the experience and know-how necessary to achieve realincreases in user productivity, a goal that is achieved far more rarely thanis generally recognized, has little effect on a professional's job security.andM;Bruce A. JohnstonandM;International Project Services Inc.andM;Jefferson, Md.andM;MYOPIC VIEWandM;To the Editor:andM;Will Zachmann continues to amaze me with his myopic view of data processing.andO;His column castigating IBM for its recent announcement of more &quot;mainframedinosaurs&quot; (Sept.andP;  17) exemplifies Mr. Zachmann's incorrect assumptions aboutinformation processing.andM;Does Zachmann think that all information stored by computers is &quot;personal?&quot;andO;In fact, a great deal of information is &quot;global&quot; in nature, and personalcomputers are inherently ill-equipped to deliver vast amounts of data tothousands of users at any given point in time.andM;It's tempting to argue that large PC networks could be substituted formainframes.andP;  However, by the time you've added enough security, wiring andfile servers to handle thousands of users, not only is the overall cost outof sight, but these computers are no longer personal.andM;I agree that personal computers are the optimal choice for price andusability in many instances.andP;  But the next time you find yourself gettingemergency cash out of an airport ATM a thousand miles from home, thank IBMand, for that matter, all makers of mainframes for continuing to invest inthe area of big iron for big jobs.andM;S.J.andP;  Schaeffer, IIIandM;Germantown, Tenn.andM;PICTURE'S WORTH 1,000 WORDSandM;To the Editor:andM;Jim Seymour's Sept.andP;  17 column misses a couple of important points regardingthe differences between a fundamentally text-oriented representation vs.andP;  afundamentally graphic representation of information.andM;At a recent luncheon, a former president of the Association of ProfessionalEngineers of Ontario commented that most of the engineers and scientists shedealt with had a distinct preference for working with the Macintosh platform.andM;The reason, she felt, was that in the engineering, scientific andmathematical communities, there has always been a need to representinformation graphically for accurate analysis and to identify trends.andP;  TheMacintosh platform intrinsically works as a graphic environment from theoperating system up, and is quite different from a disjointed graphic shellpasted on top of a text-based infrastructure.andM;Language is, by its nature, only a crude attempt to represent the graphicobjects intrinsic to nature -- a picture is worth a thousand words.andM;From one language to another there are differences in how objects arerepresented or described.andP;  A graphic is independent of such biases.andP;  Tosuggest that somehow people who express themselves graphically are lessaccurate or concise than text-oriented individuals is, in fact,misrepresentative.andM;Text can only approach being a crude and imprecise description of a graphicworld.andM;Those who insist on a text-oriented approach to their analysis of problemswould quickly be overwhelmed by information overload.andP;  They are akin topeople who would teach a calculus or physics program without any graphswhatsoever in the mistaken belief that they are being more accurate.andM;Dennis L. VenerusandM;Scarborough, OntarioandM;RELATIONAL VIEWandM;To the Editor:andM;Jim Seymour's Oct.andP;  1 column suggests that relational-database products havelittle to offer ordinary end users with simple applications.andM;Leaving aside the real problems of vendor abuse of the &quot;relational&quot; label andthe existence of what Seymour calls &quot;pseudo-relational-database programs,&quot;true relational products, to the extent that they implement the relationalmodel of data set forth by Edgar Codd and others, offer benefits to usersacross the entire range of sophistication.andM;It is true that the relational model of data requires that even simple datamodels be represented as multiple tables.andP;  It is also a reasonable guess thatrelational products will require the ability to have a number of operatingsystem files open at one time.andM;It is mere confusion, however, to infer that there is any direct correlationof relational tables and operating system files, or that the use of multipletables to implement a data model represents unnecessary complexity for endusers with a simple application.andM;In fact, elegant relational products provide ways to present multiple tablesas simple user views.andP;  More importantly, no non-relational flat-file systemis capable of delivering the benefits of relational products.andM;Far from being technical or obscure, these benefits should appeal to theleast technically sophisticated end user.andP;  The relational model of data givesusers a single, simple, intuitive way to view their data.andP;  It provides both away to capture the inherent properties of data and facilities for exploringthese properties through query languages.andP;  It gives relational products afirm basis in mathematical and logical theory.andP;  And, generally, therelational model of data places the focus of storing data and extractinginformation where it belongs -- on the business logic of the problem at handrather than the technical details of electronic computing or databasenavigation.andM;The real challenge to developers of relational-database software is not toadmit that their products should be aimed at other developers instead ofordinary end users.andP;  It is to continue their progress toward automating andhiding the details of logical data design and database generation, which isnecessary so that the entire range of users -- from the humblest end user tothe most sophisticated developer -- can reap its overwhelming benefits.andM;John SeefeldtandM;Executive AssistantandM;Pennsylvania State TreasuryandM;Harrisburg, Pa.andM;COMPUTER LITERACY AIDandM;To the Editor:andM;Mr.andP;  Dan Yurman, in his Sept.andP;  17 letter, offered some observations ofmethods employers could use to support employees in the use of microcomputersat home.andM;He discussed the subject from the viewpoint that an employer would bewell-served by aiding its employees because the employer would get more workfrom them.andP;  That was not my motivation in aiding our staff.andP;  I wanted them tobecome more computer literate.andM;Computer literacy is a valuable skill to almost any employer and will resultin more productive employees.andM;The company I work for specializes in library automation.andP;  Those staffmembers who are not involved with product development have contact with ourcustomers and need a basic understanding of the computer vocabulary.andP;  Toencourage an understanding and appreciation for our business and computertechnology in general, I created the following policies:andM;Any staff person may borrow company equipment for use at home, provided itsabsence is acceptable according to a list of priorities for its use in theoffice, and provided it is returned to the office during normal workinghours.andP;  Our staff uses this policy primarily to borrow laptops and modems.andM;Any staff member may attend any seminar taught by our staff for our clientsin our offices, provided that they are not bumping a paying customer out ofthe class.andP;  The staff member will not be charged tuition and will be givenrelease time to attend (although their supervisor must approve of the releasetime).andM;Any staff member may purchase computer equipment or software from the companyat the company's actual cost.andP;  Purchases over $1,000 may be financed at 10percent interest as a payroll deduction.andM;These policies are in writing, and every new hire is informed of them.andP;  Theyhave no direct costs to us because they utilize existing equipment andseminars.andP;  I am very pleased to say that out of a staff of 25, only two donot have a computer at home (some employees are into their third generationof home computers).andM;I have noticed a significant improvement in the level of communicationbetween our staff and clients.andP;  I believe we are serving our customers moreefficiently and with less frustration.andM;James HensingerandM;Manager, Microsystems and ServicesandM;Bibliographical Center for ResearchandM;Denver, Colo.andM;COLOR RANGE KEYandM;To the Editor:andM;Dave Methvin's statement in his Oct.andP;  1 column regarding the desirability of24-bit color boards (&quot;An 800-by-600-pixel screen has less than half a millionpixels, so 16 million colors is overkill&quot;), reinforces a common misconceptionabout the functionality of high-performance color boards.andP;  It is the range ofcolors that is important, not the number of simultaneous colors a board canproduce.andM;Granted, an 800-by-600-pixel screen has only 480,000 pixels, providing amaximum capability of 480,000 simultaneous colors, but 24-bit boards provide16 million available colors per pixel.andP;  Each pixel can be set to any of 16million colors, providing a rich palette that enables the screen to displayphoto-realistic color images.andM;Sixteen million colors on an 800-by-600-pixel screen is not overkill.andP;  It isquickly becoming the standard for computer graphics color displays, wheregreater depth in each hue will create more realistic images.andM;E.andP;  Kenneth HoffmanandM;Department of CommunicationandM;Seton Hall UniversityandM;South Orange, N.J.andM;NOT AN E-MAIL SERVICEandM;To the Editor:andM;A few important points are missing in your Oct.andP;  15 story on Prodigy's 1991plans for personal messaging.andM;The Prodigy service was designed to provide families with a broad range ofinformation and transactional services, including a moderate amount ofconvenience messaging.andP;  It was never intended to be an E-mail service, andanyone using it primarily for that is using the wrong service.andP;  Otherservices are optimized for heavy E-mail usage, but that is not a businessthat Prodigy chooses to pursue.andM;The Prodigy service has hundreds of features, including 30 free messages amonth for a flat fee of $9.95 per month in an annual subscription.andP;  It doesnot impose access charges or time-of-day restrictions.andM;Geoffrey E. MooreandM;Director of Market Programs andandM;CommunicationsandM;Prodigy Services Co.andM;White Plains, N.Y.andM;RECTIFIED RESISTANCEandM;To the Editor:andM;In the Aug.andP;  20 edition of PC Week there is an error on Page 80.andP;  Thesentence reads: &quot; .andP;  .  .  and if the resistance is close to 50 ohms, thecircuit is most likely all right.&quot; Since there are two 50-ohm terminators ona given segment (one on each end), the resistance should be close to 25 ohmswhen measured at a BNC-T connector.andP;  A measurement of 50 ohms would indicatethat one end of the segments is not terminated.andM;Michael J. SteigerandM;Microcomputer Products GroupandM;Irvine, Calif.andM;Eric Rayl responds:andM;Mr.andP;  Steiger is correct; if the resistance is measured from a BNC-Tconnector, 25 ohms would be an appropriate reading.andP;  Unfortunately, I did notclarify that I perform all of my testing by taking a cable off of either oneside of a T connector or the other, similar to how a cable scanner would beused (this assumes that the network is already down).andP;  Using this method, a50-ohm reading does mean proper termination, and any other reading tells youthere is a problem in the direction of the terminator on the tested segment.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
