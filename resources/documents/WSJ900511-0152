Wyatt Jr. told the annual meeting here.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Wyatt said that oil and natural gas markets are&quot;moving out of a period of surplus and into a period&quot; wherethose markets &quot;will be driven by availability of supply.&quot; Headded, &quot;We see a cyclical turnaround just getting started.&quot;   In fact, Mr. Wyatt warned that natural-gas shortages couldcome shortly, particularly during the winter. Discussing theshort period of frigid weather last winter, he said, &quot;If thatcold snap had lasted 30 days we would have had brownouts andblackouts all over.&quot;   The energy company said its spending on capital expansionin 1989 and 1990 will exceed a total of $1 billion. &quot;Spendingwill be mainly on facilities to serve new markets and newbusiness, not for maintenance or replacement,&quot; said James R.Paul, Coastal's chief executive.   Coastal, which made a number of successful andunsuccessful takeover attempts in the 1980s, said it nowintends to spend more of its available cash on internallygenerated projects.   &quot;There's going to be less of a tendency for us andeverybody else to make acquisitions&quot; in the currentenvironment, Mr. Paul said. He added that Coastal perceivesenergy company stock prices to be relatively strong andanti-takeover restrictions to be stricter and morewidespread.   Mr. Wyatt said he expects Americans to increasingly demandcleaner fuels, and that &quot;Coastal is well positioned.&quot; Thecompany has emphasized its low-sulfur coal reserves, acquiredan oil refinery in Aruba that will make low-sulfur productsand increased its natural gas assets.   Mr. Paul said Coastal expects 1990 net income to increasefrom last year's $170.1 million, or $1.81 a share. He said heexpects operating profit for the company's gas segment willbe about the same this year, or at about the $423 millionlevel of 1989, but that those earnings should be &quot;upsignificantly&quot; by 1992. The gas surplus of recent years isabout gone, he said, which should bring higher transportationmargins for Coastal's pipeline operations.   Environmental pressures should boost demand for naturalgas, considered a cleaner-burning fuel, Mr. Paul said.Coastal plans to double its own natural-gas production in thenext few years from the 400 million cubic feet a day producedlast year, he said. He added that operating profit fromexploration and production will be double the $41 million of1989 when Coastal reaches its goal.   Coal earnings will rise this year from 1989's $72 million,Mr. Paul said. Nearly all 900 million tons of Coastal'srecoverable reserves are classified as low sulfur, he added.</TEXT></DOC>
