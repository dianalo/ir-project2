Shultz announced.   ``At the final moment in negotiations, Noriega would not carrythrough with the arrangements his representatives had negotiated,''Shultz told a hastily-arranged news conference.   ``No offers remain on the table,'' he said.   Under Secretary of State Michael Armacost told reporters thatNoriega had indicated that ``majors and captains'' within Panama'sDefense Forces ``might take strong action'' against him if heagreed to the deal.   The United States has been seeking Noriega's removal since hisindicment in February by a federal grand jury in Miami on chargesof taking at least $4.6 million in payoffs from Colombia's Medellincartel to protect cocaine shipments, launder money and hide drugsmugglers from law enforcement officials.   The collapse of the talks came as President Reagan was flying toHelsinki, Finland on the first leg of his summit meeting in Moscownext week with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.   Upon arrival, Reagan was asked at a picture-taking session withFinnish President Mauno Koivisto whether he felt his hand had beenweakened on the eve of the summit. ``I don't feel weakened,'' hesaid.   Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill welcomed thedevelopment. ``Sending Noriega off into retirement with a legalgolden parachute ... would have been the wrong step at the wrongtime,'' said Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas.   The key provisions of the proposed agreement called forNoriega's resignation in August as Defense Force commander, hisdeparture from Panama and, in exchange, the dismissal of U.S. drugsmuggling indictments against him.   The goal was to remove Noriega from the Panamanian politicalscene as the country moved toward civilian-led rule withpresidential elections in May 1989.   Shultz indicated that the two countries now appear to be back tosquare one.   ``All proposals addressed during these negotiations have beenwithdrawn,'' he said.   Attorney General Edwin Meese III said in a statement thatNoriega is a ``fugitive'' and the U.S. government will use ``everylegal means at our disposal to bring him to justice, to remove himfrom power and to restore democracy to Panama.''   The U.S. negotiating plan had drawn considerable bipartisanopposition at home and from anti-Noriega forces in Panama as well.Among the critics was Democratic presidential front runner MichaelDukakis.   Vice President George Bush, in a break with Reagan, said he, ifelected president, would not negotiate with reputed drug dealers,either domestic and foreign. The Senate approved 86-10 a resolutioncriticizing the proposed dismissal of the drug charges againstNoriega.   Throughout, the State Department view was that dismissal of theindictments against Noriega was a small price to pay for hisdeparture from Panama and the restoration of democratic rule.   The negotiations reached the do-or-die stage starting on Mondaywhen State Department envoy Michael G. Kozak returned to Panamaafter two days of consultations in Washington.   U.S. officials said Wednesday morning that agreement seemed tobe in hand but Kozak telephoned the department at 4 p.m. EDT to saythat Noriega had rejected the plan.   Shultz said the administration expects to work with LatinAmerican democracies in hopes of seeking a solution.   He said the United States ``will continue to work with thepeople of Panama ... to get Noriega out of Panama,'' but he offeredno details of how that might be accomplished.   He refused comment when asked if military solutions are beingcontemplated. But at the Pentagon, officials insisted there were noplans afoot for direct military intervention in Panama.   The officials, who agreed to discuss the matter only if notidentified, also said the roughly 11,000 American troops in Panamahad not been placed on any special alert.   Shultz said that Noriega backed away from the proposal when hesaw that ``it got him out of Panama and it got him out of power.''   Shultz said the United States would continue to recognize oustedPresident Arturo Eric Delvalle as the legitimate leader of Panama,rather than President Manuel Solis Palma, the nominal leaderapproved by Noriega.   In Panama, a pro-government newspaper said Panama's militaryrejected the proposed accord because the plan would not guaranteethat Solis Palma remained in power.   ``The high command of the Defense Forces and the StrategicMilitary Council rejected the points of conversation because theyfound no guarantee of the continuity of the constitutional mandateof President Manuel Solis Palma,'' said the pro-governmentafternoon daily La Republica, citing unidentified sources.   U.S. Attorney Leon Kellner, who obtained the indictment againstNoriega in Miami, said after Shultz's announcement, ``We areprepared to go forward with the case and we will do so.''   Neal Sonnett, one of Noriega's four Miami lawyers, said hebelieves the Miami indictment against his client could well bedismissed.   ``I have continued to work on our motion for dismissal of theindictment on legal grounds and we will continue to do so. We stillfeel that we have a strong case for dismissal on a variety onvarious grounds,'' Sonnett said.   Shultz had planned to accompany Reagan when he left WashingtonWednesday morning for Helsinki.   But Shultz stayed behind to monitor the Panama situation,delaying his departure for Finland until early evening.</TEXT></DOC>
