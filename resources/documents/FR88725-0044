FSEC will assist Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in their developmentwith industry of residential fenestration design tools. Significant energysavings can result from the development and appropriate use of advancedfenestration systems. Building fenestration (windows, skylights, etc.)greatly influences energy use since such systems provide both a barrierto heat loss and a collector of energy in the form of heat and daylight.Eligibility: Eligibility for this renewal award is being limited to FSEC,an institute of higher education, because of their high qualificationsin the fields of optical physics and fenestration system design and evaluation.The term of this renewal shall be from June 1, 1988 through December 31,1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>U.S. Department of Energy, Officeof Procurement Operations, Attn: Phyllis Morgan, MA-453.2, 1000 IndependenceAvenue SW., Washington, DC 20585.<ITAG tagnum="6">Thomas S.
