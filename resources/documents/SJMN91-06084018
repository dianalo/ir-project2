Development is more corporate, organized,driven by business plans and marketing white papers instead of the creativespark of a maverick's imagination.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Computing  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  DEALING WITH CORPORATE BIGNESS IS A GAMESOME DESIGNERS AVOID  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Computer Trends  </MEMO><TEXT>     Except for computer games, that is.;    At a time software is more oftenwritten in modules by teams of programmers at companies with millions ofdollars in annual revenues, computer games are still for the most part writtenby people who remain independent -- and even a little eccentric.;    The nexttime you enjoy the bizarre little twists or weird humor in a computer game,you can thank the fact that most game designers can't abide the thought ofdriving to the office every day.;    But why would a programmer talentedenough to write games, the kinds of programs that often test the limits of thetechnology, give up the stock options, paid vacations and other benefits ofworking for Microsoft or Lotus?;    &quot;The simple reason,&quot; says game designerNicky Robinson, &quot;is the 20-foot commute. And you can work in your underwear.&quot;;   There's a big price for freedom: Most game designers earn far less thantheir corporate cousins who write programs like spreadsheets or wordprocessors. The only way out is to dream up a real hit that brings in theroyalties, the game version of the best-selling novel.;    &quot;It's a crap shoot.If you look at the time you put in, then you can be making $2.25 an hour,&quot;Robinson says. &quot;Other times, you're rolling in the money.&quot;;    That's the wayit has always been, and the designers are willing to keep it that way. But thelifestyle of the maverick may be on the wane.;    The first wave of gamedesigners is, like other baby boomers, becoming a bit more settled. This yearat the annual Computer Game Developers Conference in San Jose, all-day childcare was offered, with about a half-dozen youngsters enrolled. Next year, theorganizers expect double that number of children. There were a lot of pregnantdesigners at this year's conference.;    Another change is that some gamedesigners are beginning to think about organizing themselves in a kind ofprofessional association -- they hesitate to use the terms union or guild --that might let them keep autonomy but use the leverage of the group to pressfor better income and compete with corporate game makers.;    The gamebusiness, as any designer will tell you, is entertainment. And entertainment,as any Wall Street analyst will tell you, is big business. Game developers seetheir business coming to resemble Hollywood more all the time, especially asconsumers demand more complex games with movielike sights and sounds. (Two ofthe biggest names in Hollywood, Lucasfilm and Disney, now operate divisionsthat produce computer games.);    To go Hollywood means production teams, withartists, composers and writers aiding designers in producing a finished game.The maverick is endangered.;    &quot;My ability to stay in business gets smallerevery day,&quot; says Mark Baldwin, who is part owner of a small design firm calledWhite Wolf Productions. &quot;Production and development costs go up every day.Publishers who used to put money into outside games now want to do itin-house. And that means I have to be a money chaser.&quot;;    That's a game mostdesigners don't want to play.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Rory J.
