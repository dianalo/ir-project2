These telemetry systems gather data whichcan be used to determine if a weapon functioned as intended. The authorsare designing a telemetry system to support new programs for the nextdecade and to replace old telemetry systems which can no longer be produced.This multi-system Joint Test Assembly (JTA) is being designed to be modular,flexible, and testable. New techniques for increasing reliability, suchas redundancy, error detection and correction, and microprocessor recoverywill be employed. The requirements for each program can be met by choosingthe necessary circuitry from a &quot;shopping list&quot; and packaging to meetthe mechanical constraints for each system. Production specificationsand test equipment will be in place to support any telemetry which iscomposed of the previously-designed modules. Modifications of hardwareand software to support individual requirements will be kept to a minimum.The authors expect this new approach to telemetry system developmentto significantly reduce cost and lead time for every program on whichit is employed. The use of this telemetry system on multiple programsshould also enhance reliability.</TEXT></DOC>
