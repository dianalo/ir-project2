The department granted Austria the new status after beingassured that the country is satisfactorily enforcing exportcontrols established by its revised foreign trade law. Untilnow, Switzerland, Finland, Sweden and Singapore have been theonly neutral countries enjoying most of the export-licensingbenefits that the U.S. normally accords its allies.</LP><TEXT>   The U.S. move will allow U.S. vendors to shiphigher-quality computers and other electronics products toAustria without a license. U.S. exporters also will beallowed to ship large numbers of even higher-level computersunder single distribution licenses. Austria, moreover, willgain the right to import the most advanced U.S. mainframeswithout licensing paperwork, provided the equipment is boughtby state-controlled enterprises and will remain on theenterprises' own premises.   Austrian diplomats welcomed the U.S. action, assertingthat the new trade privileges will enhance Vienna's effort toattract U.S. companies interested in establishing Europeanregional headquarters with sophisticated computercapabilities.   The U.S. granted Austria somewhat lesser benefits in 1987,shortly after Vienna began requiring export permits forcertain strategic goods that previously had crossed itsborders freely. But the U.S. said at the time that it wouldwithhold other benefits until it was satisfied that Austria'sbusy free-free zones were being adequately policed.   Austria's new status also allows it to freely export toWestern Europe, Japan and Australia computers containing mostkinds of U.S.-made semiconductors and other components.Previously, Austrian computer makers have been required inmany instances to get U.S. permission to export productscontaining such U.S. parts.</TEXT></DOC>
