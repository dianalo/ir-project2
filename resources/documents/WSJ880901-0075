Flenniken, chairman, president and chief executive, said.    That compares with 1987 net income of C$214 million, or C$4.87 a share. The 1987 figures are on a pro-forma basis to account for the merger in June of Great Lakes Forest Products Ltd. and CIP Inc. The company, which produces newsprint, paper and other forest products, earned C$148.6 million, or C$3.38 a share, for the 1988 first half.    In an interview, Mr. Flenniken also continued to call for 1988 sales of C$3.12 billion, a 12% rise from pro forma sales of C$2.77 billion in 1987.    The 1988 forecast was included last April in documents for the proposed merger of Great Lakes and CIP. Great Lakes was 54.3% held by Canadian Pacific Ltd., while CIP was wholly owned by Canadian Pacific. The merged company is 79.7%-owned by Canadian Pacific, which has interests in a railway, forest products, hotels and mining.    Mr. Flenniken said the merger is going &quot;smoothly.&quot; He added that operations &quot;haven't been affected at all&quot; by the merger and that &quot;the entire company is operating at available capacity in all product lines.&quot;    Of about 360 staff positions, 13 have been eliminated, he said. There are more staff cutbacks to come, but he declined to elaborate. The company will continue to have offices in Montreal; Thunder Bay, Ontario, and Vancouver, British Columbia.    Mr. Flenniken declined to indicate when newsprint prices might be increased. CIP last raised newsprint prices 6.6% in January. He noted that growth in newsprint consumption is a little slower than last year, perhaps as a result of reduced retail advertising. Some customers have large newsprint inventories &quot;but I couldn't say if that's intentional,&quot; Mr. Flenniken said. </TEXT></DOC>
