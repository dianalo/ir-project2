It sounds like easy money. Shares of a publicly traded stock fund are trading well below the fund's portfolio value. A predator makes a bid. Small investors jump aboard, hoping to bag fat profits as the fund's shares leap.    But several takeover and restructuring battles for these so-called closed-end funds have bogged down lately, leaving investors in the lurch and portending fewer such fights in the months ahead.    Raiders &quot;are finding out that funds aren't going to roll over and play dead,&quot; says Thomas Herzfeld, a Miami investment manager specializing in closed-end funds.    Predators, for example, have been stymied at Clemente Global Growth Fund, Cypress Fund, Liberty All-Star Equity Fund, Blue Chip Value Fund, Schafer Value Trust and Bancroft Convertible Fund. The fights are far from over, but a few funds have managed to throw raiders off balance with legal curves and anti-takeover moves.    The closed-end funds, which issue a fixed number of shares that trade publicly, are vulnerable because their shares often languish at a discount to the market value of their portfolios. By contrast, open-end mutual funds continuously issue and redeem shares on demand at prices based on their portfolio value.    Some restructuring attempts have succeeded. Just this week, Global Growth andamp; Income Fund was liquidated. Financial News Composite Fund and France Fund soon will convert to the open-end structure, a move that allows fund shareholders to immediately reap the difference between the discounted trading price of fund shares and the higher market value of the portfolio.    But trying to piggyback on an announced bid can be dangerous.    &quot;If you come in at a 10% discount rather than at 18%, you've got to question whether the game is worth the candle,&quot; says George Foot, managing partner of Newgate Management Associates in Northampton, Mass. If the bid falters, he says, the share price can slide enough to knock the discount back to 18%.    Take Cypress Fund. The fund's discount -- after narrowing to about 11% after a bid by a group led by Robert Gordon -- has widened again to more than 16% as Mr. Gordon's six-month-old pursuit has bogged down amid litigation and competing tender offers.    Even getting in early is no panacea. Consider those who bought the Clemente Global Growth Fund on the heels of a bid last September by a group led by Thomas Pickens III.    The fund was trading at a 15.6% discount to the value of its holdings when the bid was made. After the Pickens-led group ran into pitfalls, investors were left recently with a stock trading at 23% less than its net asset value.    One unusual roadblock used by Clemente has proved at least temporarily effective. It filed a suit citing an arcane federal securities law that prevents investment companies from buying more than 3% of the shares of other funds. A federal judge in New York ruled that the Pickens-led group was in fact an investment company, and barred its offer.    Savvy investors actually sold their shares when the Clemente and Cypress bids were made. Says Phillip Goldstein, a New York investor who dumped both funds when offers emerged, &quot;There's some chance of it eventually open-ending, but you can't count on it.&quot;    Instead, Mr. Goldstein and some other investors prefer to buy funds that already have agreed to be restructured. Their reasoning: Even though there's less money to be made, the gains are all but assured. The France Fund, for instance, will convert to an open-end fund by autumn, but continues to trade at about a 6% discount. That means investors buying today will make 6% when the fund is restructured -- a pretty nifty annualized return.    Many investors now have turned their sights on funds that have attracted sizable holdings by investor groups. These include First Financial Fund, Dover Regional Financial Shares, Nicholas-Applegate Growth Equity Fund, Pilgrim Regional BankShares, the Brazil Fund and Italy Fund.    But there can be pitfalls in jumping in too early. Investors who bought the Brazil Fund in April when VBI Corp. announced a 9.9% stake would have lost a bundle; shortly after the news, the fund was rocked by a Brazilian market crisis, and the fund's shares plunged about 25%.    VBI, after successful raids on the Scandinavia Fund and the France Fund, has hit roadblocks at the Italy Fund. Shortly after the group disclosed a big stake, the fund proposed anti-takeover provisions, doubling the fund's discount.    If bids fail, investors can really suffer. Not only are the fund shares likely to slide, but fund expenses may soar. That's because fund managers typically spare no cost when warding off raiders, and those expenses eat into investors' returns. Fund managers, moreover, can be so distracted in fending off an attacker that their portfolio management can be affected.    Don't expect as many bids in the coming months, however. The discounts of many stock funds have narrowed as stock prices have risen, making the funds less attractive to raiders. And the recent tribulations of the Pickens and Gordon groups have taught some potential predators some hard lessons.    Says Steven Samuels, editor of the Deep Discount Digest, a Santa Monica, Calif., newsletter: &quot;It's not as simple as it seems.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
