The approach by North's lawyers has featured two significantdisclosures so far at his trial:   _Reagan signed off on a deal to slip $110 million in extra aid toHonduras in exchange for that country's government help to theguerrillas.   _The president apparently gave the go-ahead for airdroppingintelligence and recoilless rifles for the sinking of arms-bearingships, this at a time when Congress had banned military aid to theContras.   North's lawyers have been able to focus much attention onReagan's role in secretly supporting the Contras, with moredisclosures to come.   Part of North's defense is built around previously unpublicizedquid pro quo arrangements the Reagan administration had withHonduras and other countries.   North lawyer Brendan Sullivan is hoping, through the discussionof Reagan's role, to convince the jury that North's actions insecretly helping the Contras were taken at the behest of thepresident.   ``We don't comment on pending legal matters,'' Mark Weinberg, aspokesman for the former president, said when asked about thetestimony concerning Reagan's actions.   The apparent weak point in Sullivan's approach is that it relieson blurring the line between lying to Congress and avoiding Congress.   Before Reagan initialed the secret quid pro quo arrangement withHonduras in 1985, North recommended that a special emissary unlikelyto be questioned by Congress be entrusted with details of theproposed deal.   The normal course would have been to communicate the arrangementthrough the U.S. ambassador to Honduras, who could expect to becalled to Capitol Hill for questioning.   Former-national security adviser Robert McFarlane testified atNorth's trial that Reagan agreed Congress shouldn't be told aboutthird-country support for the Contras.   The president's inner circle of advisers kept information onContra aid secret, even from each other. What they didn't know, theywouldn't be able to communicate if asked by Congress.   Members of the National Security Planning Group, including thepresident and vice president and several Cabinet officers, discussedthe possibility of pressing third countries for Contra aid at a 1984meeting in the White House Situation Room.   Unbeknownst to some of them, Saudi Arabia had already agreed togive $1 million a month. McFarlane, who moderated the meeting,remained silent about the Saudi arrangements, which he had helpedset up.   When a State Department official was questioned by Congress, heresponded that he had heard there was third-country support for theContras, but that he knew nothing about it.   McFarlane, who did know, wasn't asked.   But a strategy of silence was no longer possible in September1985. By that time, the news media were linking North tofund-raising efforts and tactical advice being offered the Contras.   Letters came in from Congress. Answers were demanded. McFarlanewas on the spot.   In testimony last Thursday, the former national security advisersaid he discussed the congressional queries with Reagan.   There was no indication from McFarlane's testimony that Reaganrecognized the complexion of the problem had changed completely;that in order to retain secrecy, answers would have to be hedged orfalsified.   McFarlane said he simply told the president that ``we were boundto be criticized in any event,'' no matter what the responses toletters from Congress.   Reagan ``accepted it,'' saying, ``OK,'' McFarlane recalled.   Prosecutor John Keker, in his questioning of McFarlane,repeatedly elicited testimony that Reagan never suggested lying toCongress, part of the prosecution's effort to show it was North'sidea.   Four of the 12 criminal charges against North are that heobstructed Congress or made false statements by preparing writtendenials in 1985 that National Security Council staffers wereinvolved in assisting the Contras.   McFarlane, who signed the letters, pleaded guilty to threemisdemeanors and was fined $20,000. McFarlane also pleaded guilty toa fourth misdemeanor in connection with congressional testimony hegave denying knowledge of Saudi government support for the Contras.</TEXT></DOC>
