The official Saudi Press Agency said the foreign ministers ofSaudi Arabia, Algeria and Morocco met for 2{ hours Wednesday night.Deliberations were to continue behind closed doors Thursday.   The resumption of the effort was coupled with statements ofsupport from Arab and international powers, especially the UnitedStates, the Soviet Union and France.   King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, an influential Arab leader, voicedoptimism Tuesday about the chances of a cease-fire in the latestconfrontation between Christians and a Moslem-Syrian alliance.   Upon arriving in the Red Sea port of Jiddah for the meeting,Morocco's Foreign Minister Abdel-Latif Filali said the committee hassecured ``clarifications'' and ``guarantees,'' but would notelaborate.   These, he told the Saudi news agency, would enable him, Algeria'sBouallam Bilsayeh and Saudi Arabia's Prince Saud al-Faisal ``to workanew to reach the appropriate solutions for Lebanese nationalreconciliation.''   The three ministers met the last time in Algiers on July 31, whenthey announced they were suspending their mission, mainly becauseSyria would not accept a timetable for pulling its 40,000 troopsfrom Lebanon.   The Syrians moved into Lebanon under an Arab League peacekeepingmandate in 1976. But they have since become the Moslems' mainbackers in the 14-year-old civil war against the Christians.   Christian leaders have called for departure of Syrian troops as aprecondition for negotiating a settlement with the Moslems.   After nearly four years of relative calm, fighting broke out inMarch between Christian army units and the Syrians. At least 850people have since been killed and more than 2,500 wounded.   Syrian Vice-President Abdul-Halim Khaddam, on a visit toneighboring North Yemen, said Wednesday: ``We should all worktogether to help the committee implement the resolutions of theCasablanca summit.'' He referred to the top-level Arab Leagueconference held in Morocco in May.   That summit entrusted Fahd, Morocco's King Hassan II and AlgerianPresident Chadli Bendjedid with finding a settlement in Lebanonwithin six months.   Diplomatic sources said the ministers, taking their cue fromFahd's statements Tuesday, would issue a call for an immediatecease-fire, ``the first important and necessary steps toward asettlement.''   Sources in Jiddah said the committee was considering a four-stagepeace plan comprising, a comprehensive cease-fire, lifting all landand naval blockades, inviting parliament to talks on a ``charter ofpolitical reform,'' and election of a president by the parliament``within a few weeks.''</TEXT></DOC>
