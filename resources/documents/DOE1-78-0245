Sonography and computed tomography alsodemonstrated dense material in the calyces, renal pelves and ureters.Since then, we have found another patient, a 9-year-old female with acutelymphatic leukemia who was not receiving chemotherapy with a similarpattern on sonography and computed tomography. These densities unlikethose in our first patient were not visible on a plain film of the abdomen.All of the material disappeared spontaneously in both patients.</TEXT></DOC>
