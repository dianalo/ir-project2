The words and the gesture were eloquent, but congressionalDemocrats are going to want something more concrete. Bush said whathe wants to bargain about; the question now is what he'll bring tothe table to negotiate with. He's holding his first congressionalleadership meeting at the White House today.   Bush recalled a time when Congress and administrations workedtogether to produce budgets on which the nation could live. ``Let usnegotiate soon _ and hard,'' he said in his inaugural address.``...The people ... did not send us here to bicker. They ask us torise above the merely partisan.''   But taxes and spending were part of the ammunition Bush aimed atthe Democrats during the campaign that won him the White House. On ahundred platforms he said Congress would try to force him intoimposing new taxes and he'd say no, ``Read my lips, no new taxes.''   The targets of Bush's favorite applause line aren't likely toforget the way it was used against them. They've already said thatBush will have to narrow the deficit gap without taxes or eat hiscampaign words and propose steps to increase revenue.   Furthermore, the tax question leads to the broader issues ofspending priorities, which embroiled the White House andcongressional Democrats for all eight years of Ronald Reagan'spresidency.   That put it at the center of political debate, and as vicepresident, Bush was a ranking debater. Beginning his presidency, heproposed another way.   ``A new breeze is blowing _ and the old bipartisanship must bemade new again,'' Bush said in his address on Friday. ``To myfriends _ and yes, I do mean friends _ in the loyal opposition _ andyes, I mean loyal _ I put out my hand.''   Bush said he was reaching out to House Speaker Jim Wright ofTexas, and to Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell of Maine,and he turned to them on the inaugural platform to underscore thegesture.   ``... This is the age of the offered hand,'' the president said.   Bipartisanship historically has been linked to foreign policy,not to domestic issues like deficit budgets. Republican Sen. ArthurVandenberg of Michigan became a symbol of bipartisanship when heturned from isolationism to support President Harry S. Truman inmajor foreign policy moves after World War II.   Vandenberg said the two-party system was indispensable, but thatthe nation's voice should be united ``at the water's edge.'' Bushused that phrase in his address.   He then proposed to extend the idea to subjects that don't gonear the water. Taking office before a Capitol dominated byDemocrats _ and almost certain to stay that way throughout hiscurrent term _ he said there should be compromise instead ofdissension, harmony instead of discord.   ``For Congress, too, has changed in our time,'' said thepresident, once a Texas congressman. ``There has grown a certaindivisiveness. We have seen the hard looks and heard the statementsin which not each other's ideas are challenged, but each other'smotives.   ``Our great parties have often been far apart and untrusting ofeach other.''   The bitter campaign in which Bush defeated Massachusetts Gov.Michael Dukakis added to that mistrust.   Reagan could afford a hard line with Congress, especially duringhis first term. Republicans had won a Senate majority on hiscoattails _ it lasted six years _ and he was soaring in the polls.House Democrats could read numbers. Votes crucial to Reagan's taxand spending cut programs came from Democrats who were worried aboutthe political price of opposing him.   The Bush ticket didn't show that kind of pull and the newpresident can't exert that kind of pressure. His Republicans lostthree seats in the House and one in the Senate in 1988.   Under the circumstances, new-look bipartisanship would be idealfor Bush if he can get it. He's determined to try. As he put it in apre-inauguration interview:   ``Using Lyndon Johnson's words, maybe different methods, let'sreason together.''</TEXT><TEXT>   EDITOR'S NOTE: Walter R.
