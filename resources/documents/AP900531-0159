Gorbachev.   Bush: ``Well, I'd just say at the end of a very interesting daythat the talks have gone reasonably well. The mood is very positivein the sense that I had a very good, and I mean genuinely, not in adiplomatic sense, very good exchange, for a couple of hours thismorning with President Gorbachev. I'm very well pleased with theground we covered.   ``This afternoon's meeting, the tone was positive. Differencesremain. We talked about the German question there. I believePresident Gorbachev indicated after the meeting that he didn't thinkthe whole question of Germany would be resolved. Certainly we're notin any position to resolve that entire question. But when he saidthat the differences were ... had been narrowed somewhat, I'm takingsome heart from that and we'll continue these discussions tomorrow.   ``But I think, given the difficulties of some of the problems weface, the talks have gone certainly as well as I could have expectedup to now, and we still have a lot of discussion. But we've touchedon almost every contentious issue, as well as spelling out the areasin which we have common interests and where things are going verywell between us.   ``So, that's a report for tonight, and tomorrow I'll be able tosay a little bit more. But I won't go into details that we've agreedwe're not going to talk about.''   Q: ``None of us understand why you can't sign a trade agreementif it's all wrapped up.''   Bush: ``Well, we haven't said whether we can sign a tradeagreement or not, yet.''   Q: ``Why?''   Bush: ``Will get ... we haven't discussed that yet.''   Q: ``(Inaudible) ... instructed the foreign ministers to discusssomething that emerged today about Germany, sir. Could you tell usabout that?''   Bush: ``No, because we agreed we wouldn't. We agreed we'd letthem discuss it ...''   Q: ``Will you confirm that ...''   Bush: ``... and I will say I think ... I think when I heard whatPresident Gorbachev said, that is exactly what we agreed he wouldtalk about. So, we're just going to stay with that guidance.''   Q: ``When will they meet ...''   Bush: ``I don't know, probably tomorrow, probably tomorrow.''   Q: ``Was there some narrowing of differences that made you decidethe foreign ministers should get together with some specific detailsyou have them working on?''   Bush: ``Well, that was a proposal that President Gorbachev made,and I think the foreign ministers need to discuss in great detailthe subjects we discussed to see. But I was ... I took ... I mustsay, Michael, I took some heart from that. I was encouraged by that.Our position has been stated and restated, and we'll see where we go.   ``But I think the important point is we could talk very frankly,no rancor there, and let's hope some of the differences have beennarrowed. But, when he says this whole German question will not besolved at a meeting of this nature, I would agree with that. Weconsult our allies, and we don't ... and he knows that. He knowsthat we have a lot of consultation. But, basically, my position isthe same as it was when we went into the meetings. But I'm listeningvery carefully, listening to their views and trying to understandtheir positions.''   Q: ``Did you offer something specific for the foreign ministersto discuss on Germany?'' Bush: ``I think they do have some specificsto discuss, but there's ... that can be discussed after they getthrough talking about those things.''   Q: ``Mr. President, did you offer any concessions. Did you ...''   Bush: ``No, I want to stay with the guidance that we agreed on,but I ... our position is well known and the fundamentals have notchanged. The fundamentals have not changed.''   Q: ``Has he taken offense to your stand on Lithuania or yourremarks today at the welcoming ceremony?''   Bush: ``He didn't seem to take offense to anything. He knows thatwe had differences. I've been very up-front with him, and he's beenvery, very direct and up-front with me. So, that's one of the goodthings about the meeting. When great powers have differences,sometimes they haven't been able to talk about them in a civil way.We are talking about them in a very civil way, and I commend him forthat approach. It's one I like, it's one I understand and it's one Ithink benefits not just the United States and the Soviet Union but alot of other countries as well.''   Q: ``Would a trade bill be contingent on what you hear onLithuania?''   Bush: ``Well, we're going to discuss the details of that ...probably get into some of that tomorrow.''   Q: ``Do he feel like you have a better understanding on about ...on Germany, being that he's more ready to come your way than you areto his?''   Bush: ``We're not dealing on that. Look, we agreed to someguidance, he and I, and I'm going to stick with it, and he did. AndI think that's a good sign. We're in the middle of some discussionsabout where it stands.''</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
