When are you going to realize that society already bears an insupportable cost?    The tobacco industry is desperately fighting off courageous and principled attempts to place the costs of its activities where they belong -- with those who profit from this foul practice of enticing children into lifelong addiction. Contingency-fee lawyers are putting their careers and their own money on the line in the knowledge that they probably won't win, but something has to be done.    The tobacco industry, already subsidized by tax dollars, deducts the costs of the litigation and continues to make outlandish profits. The taxpayer bears the welfare costs of unemployment and disability and nursing-home care for the victims -- emphysema crippled the Marlboro Man and left him a public charge. Nursing-home rates of $2,000 a month are paid for by the taxpayer while the tobacco industry, knowing the consequence of its poisonous products, found another model to put on the screen.    David K.
