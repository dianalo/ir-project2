Views don't help you make money.&quot;    Selling the corporate headquarters that CSR Ltd. has occupied for 106 years is just one example of the change under way at this old-line conglomerate.    Last December, CSR announced that Mr. Burgess would become chief executive officer upon the retirement of the current chief executive, Bryan Kelman, in December of this year. Mr. Burgess isn't waiting politely in the wings: He has moved swiftly -- some say ruthlessly -- to shake up a company whose performance in recent years has been dismal.    The company is cutting staff and shedding its sidelines -- from chemicals plants to macadamia-nut farms -- so that it can better concentrate on its basic businesses of sugar and building materials.    CSR is a microcosm of Australia's economic history, growing fat on rural produce, expanding into mining and now increasingly turning to manufacturing as world commodity prices slump.    The company, set up in 1855, is one of Australia's oldest. &quot;It was a very conservative place,&quot; says Mr. Burgess. For many years, he says, &quot;you even had to get your wife approved. You had to go to your boss and say 'Please sir, can I get married?'&quot;    Nevertheless, the company prospered through its dominance of Australia's sugar industry. An embargo on imports secured its domestic market, and an agreement with the government gave it control of all exports. Its six mills produce one-quarter of Australia's raw sugar. It owns all but one of the country's refineries.    But moves to diversify during Australia's resources boom ended up crippling the company.    CSR bought into aluminum, coal and oil -- just in time to see the prices of those commodities slide. Worse, it financed its big 1981 acquisition of Delhi International Oil Corp. in U.S. currency just as the oil price and the local dollar began to tumble in tandem.    (CSR has invested the equivalent of $1.19 billion, at current exchange rates, in Delhi. Last year, it wrote off $397 million on the project, and it will take an additional $70 million write-off this year. Over five years, revenue from Delhi's natural-gas and oil production has totaled $123 million. Last March, CSR agreed to sell the company to Exxon Corp. for $712 million.)    Added to its diversification problems was a slump in world sugar prices and a decline in domestic sugar consumption because of health concerns. About the only bright spot was building materials, a business CSR got into almost as an afterthought when it was looking for something to do with the cane-fiber byproduct of its sugar mills and experimented with using it in wallboard.    CSR's Sydney headquarters was thick with overlapping layers of management. Mr. Burgess says the first hint that there was a better way to run a company came from from one of his competitors.    In 1982, he was named general manager of the building-materials division. The division jointly owned a ship with Boral Ltd., a highly successful building-products concern headed by Sir Eric Neal, and Mr. Burgess traveled to South Korea with Sir Eric to launch the vessel.    &quot;I found out how he thought and how effective Boral was, and I decided to see if we could match it,&quot; Mr. Burgess recalls.    A first step was to virtually abolish the building-materials unit's top-heavy head office and reorganize the division into four autonomous product groups. A total of 157 jobs were whittled to three. In five years, the average age of the unit's senior 20 managers dropped to 46 from 52.    In measures such as return on assets and shareholders' funds, CSR's building-materials division now is outperforming Boral. It is close behind in pre-tax earnings growth.    The building-materials operations contributed an after-tax profit of $44.8 million, up 41% from a year earlier, to CSR's results for the fiscal year that ended in March 1986. Overall, CSR's operating earnings increased 36% to $90.6 million in the year, on revenue of $2.17 billion. However, extraordinary charges of $148 million led to a net loss of $57.5 million.    Mr. Kelman, the current chief executive, says the company expects to report that operating earnings in the year that ended last March were considerably above the year-earlier figure and were &quot;in the vicinity of&quot; $108.4 million.    By quickly following the March announcement of the sale of Delhi with two takeover bids, for Pioneer Sugar Ltd. and the construction-materials concern Monier Ltd., CSR signaled its intention to return to its basic sugar and building-products businesses. The company intends to expand overseas in both these fields: in sugar, by setting up refineries; in building materials, by adding to its U.S. operations.    The company still faces allegations that it was negligent in its management of an asbestos mine it ran in Western Australia until 1966. Claims against CSR have been filed in the U.S. and Australia by former workers and others who have lung disease.    In Australia at least, CSR is unlikely to confront the kind of huge payouts that faced companies such as Manville Corp. Australia has neither class actions, where a group of plaintiffs sue, nor a contingency-fee system, under which lawyers are paid only if their client wins. That means plaintiffs face large costs in taking CSR to court. CSR denies any negligence.    The company also faces the problem of proving itself to a skeptical investment community. &quot;They wouldn't have to be cost-conscious to the point where they can't spare an extra pen if they hadn't lost so much on Delhi,&quot; says Michael Smith, an analyst at the brokerage McCaughan Dyson andamp; Co.    Mr. Smith says the new crop of acquisitions might prove just as poorly timed. &quot;I've never questioned their ability to spot good assets or to manage operations, but I do question their timing. They're buying in a racing industrial market and they're going to pay a fairly fancy price,&quot; he says.    When CSR finds a buyer for its harbor-view headquarters buildings, staff members who need to be in the city will move into a floor or two of a downtown building, while the others move out into the company's operating units.    Meanwhile, Mr. Burgess says the &quot;gentle jolt of anxiety&quot; that accompanies corporate streamlining doesn't do any harm, and he isn't worried if that attitude seems tough. &quot;I'm ruthless,&quot; he says, &quot;to make this company more efficient.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
