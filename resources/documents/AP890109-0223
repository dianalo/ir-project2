JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Environmental Protection Agency said Mondayit is considering charging the chemical industry a fee for the rightto produce chlorofluorocarbons as an attempt to spur the phasing outof such production.   Under international treaty, production of chlorofluorocarbons, orCFCs, is to be curtailed to l986 levels next July and cut in half byl998. The chemical is widely blamed for depletion of the world'satmospheric ozone.   In its fiscal l990 budget, announced Monday, the EPA said itplans to propose charging the chemical industry ``market value forthe rights to produce CFCs and related ozone-depleting substances.''   EPA Administrator Lee M. Thomas told reporters the agency has yetto determine precisely what mechanism will be used to determine thefee, which he said is expected to produce about $400 million inrevenue.   Under various proposals under consideration, the government couldcharge a fee for a certain volume of CFCs produced or could auctionoff production permits, officials suggested.   In either case, the federal fee structure is expected to keepproducers from reaping windfall profits as the available volume ofCFCs is reduced in the coming years. Federal officials fear highprofits would work against the industry rapidly developingsubstitute products.   Producers of CFCs immediately criticized the plan, although it isstill in the preliminary stages of development.   ``The government proposal is a blatant, illegal tax on anindustry that is striving to restructure through an orderlytransition to alternative products,'' said a statement issued by theDuPont Company, which is the world's largest producer of CFCs.   The company said either a permit fee or an auction on permits``will likely result in dislocations in the supply of theseimportant chemicals.''   The EPA last summer also said in a preliminary regulatoryproposal that some kind of permit and fee structure might benecessary to prevent CFC producers from taking in windfall profitsand, thereby, slowing down the phasing out of CFC production.   Because of the concern about ozone depletion, the nation's of theworld have agreed that the production of chlorofluorocarbons are tobe phased out.   CFCs are used for a variety of purposes including as a coolant inair conditioning units and refrigerators, in Halon gas fireextinguishers, in the production of styrofome, and in many countriesas a propellant in spray cans.   DuPont said that annually $28 billion in goods and services and$135 billion worth of equipment depend on CFCs in some way.</TEXT></DOC>
