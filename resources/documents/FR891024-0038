Applicationswhich anticipate participation of such a laboratory by subcontract, useagreement, or other arrangement must include satisfactory evidence of specificauthorization from the cognizant Federal agency.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>Public Law 94-413, enacted on September 17, 1976, then modified by PublicLaw 95-238, authorized the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to conduct aprogram of research, development and demonstration designed to promoteelectric and hybrid vehicle technologies to commercial feasibility. Basicand applied research on batteries for electric and hybrid vehicles wereamong the activities specified by this legislation.Over the past ten years DOE has searched for the battery type that wouldbe the breakthrough for electric vehicle transportation. The search goeson with static electrolyte, flowing electrolyte and solid electrolyte types.Progress toward achievement of the long range goals is as elusive as ever.Several battery types, in their earliest stages of development, have exhibitedhigh promise, but that promise has become more and more modest as researchturns up additional problems of a practical nature. Currently only twobattery types show field operational capability: Lead/acid and nickel/iron(Ni/Fe). Research work on the nickel/cadmium (Ni/Cd) battery for EV tractionhas focused on the non-sintered nickel electrode, in an effort to producea low cost Ni/Cd battery. However, the power limitation of this technologyhas always been a concern. This limitation is perhaps fundamental. At issueis internal ``resistance'' versus pore structure as an explanation forthe battery's poorer performance when compared with the lead/acid batteryof the same ampere-hour rating. This is a paradox, because standard rechargeableNi/Cd batteries are popular because of their high power with high voltagecranking ability. The non-sintered nickel electrode technology has a rapidtemperature-rise characteristic at high discharge rates. The high internalheat generation causes graphite oxidation, cell swelling, and loss of cellcapacity on each cycle following a high rate demand. The standard Ni/Cdbattery technology possesses two characteristics which make it attractiveas an improved power source for EV traction. It is a high power deliverydevice, as described above, and exhibits better operating characteristicsat cold ambient temperatures than the lead/acid battery. Thermal managementis required on battery types that lose their capability at low ambienttemperatures. Thermal management is a complication in the system that elevatescost, adds bulk and weight to the vehicle, and requires energy from thebattery to maintain its operating temperature which reduces the energyavailable for powering the vehicle.<ITAG tagnum="84">SCOPE</ITAG>This technology evaluation program is designed to refocus the Ni/Cd effortsalong more conventional lines. First it is designed to evaluate availablefiber-electrode technologies and identify the best technology. Assumingthat this evaluation identifies a technology that possesses the potentialto reduce cost without sacrificing performance and life, the next effortwould be directed at identification of a suitable cadmium recombinationelectrode technology. If successful on both counts, this project couldlead to a cost-reduced Ni/Cd battery technology with low maintenance requirements.This technology would offer significant advantages over Ni/Fe batteries,which possess no known potential for gas recombination and require almostdaily watering.The proposer is to provide a concise but definitive scope of work for inclusioninto any resulting agreement. The individual key tasks are to be definedand listed in logical sequence. It is the responsibility of the proposerto incliude all items in the scope of work that are required to accomplishthe stated purpose of the project. Each task is to be priced separately.DOE may choose none, all, or some combination of the tasks to be funded.As a minimum, the following tasks should be included and discussed in thestatement of work:1. Perform a survey of all fiber nickel and cadmium electrode technologies(without carbon or graphite additives) available from both foreign anddomestic battery developers. Using 50 Wh/kg (at 3-hour discharge rate)as the specific energy, 120 W/kg (at 50% depth of discharge) as the peakspecific power, and ^20 to +60anddegrees;C as the operating temperature rangeas targets, the surveyed technologies shall be ranked and current statusdocumented.2. Build three sample cells each, of the top three rated electrode combinations(20 Ah minimum size). Charge-discharge performance shall be establishedat five different temperatures within the range of interest (room temperaturebeing one point). A second series of tests shall be performed with thecells charged at room temperature and then discharged at each of the fivetemperatures previously chosen. Room temperature charging shall be at the5- to 6-hour rate, with all discharging at the one-hour rate. When operatingat temperatures other than room temperature, the charging rates shall beestablished at the gassing threshold for each temperature. These thresholdswill be reported as part of the cell characteristics.3. Identify the best technologies from task 2 to perform life cycle tests.Eight cells (20 Ah minimum size) are to be built. Four cells are to becycled at the one-hour discharge rate using a water bath to control temperature.The Simplified Federal Urban Driving Cyle (SFUDC) is to be run at regularintervals (i.e. every 50 cycles) to determine if any degradation of thedynamic characteristics is occurring.The objective is to determine if the best fiber nickel electrode, in combinationwith the best cadmium electrode, can achieve or exceed 1000 cycles. Thelife testing requirement is to extract 70% of the maximum one-hour rateenergy from the battery. Beginning-of-life performance is to be establishedafter 20 break-in or conditioning cycles. End-of-life is to be determinedwhen the voltage under load drops below the cutoff voltage before the specifiedenergy is delivered; or when the acceleration fails to meet the drivingcycle requirements on two consecutive cycles or twice during the same cycleon the SFUDC regime. Cutoff voltage may not be defined lower than sixtypercent (60%) of the open circuit voltage. The remaining four cells areto be sent to an independent testing facility designated by DOE.4. Survey the available cadmium recombination elecrode technologies andreport on the feasibility of using one or more of these technologies tobuild sealed or low maintenance batteries. The objective is to prove thepotential for one-year (minimum) maintenance-free operation in an EV tractionapplication. Noble metal catalysts are not an acceptable alternative toa recombining electrode technology.5. Build eight cells (20 Ah minimum size) of the type from Task 3 and includethe best cadmium recombination electrode, if the recombination technologyshows promise. Establish a test plan and test four cells to show the effectivenessof the recombination electrode. Testing shall include an initial chargecurrent equivalent to a 5- to 6-hour discharge rate, with allowance fortaper current charging after 80% SOC. The data must be usable to definethe maximum taper charge current that the recombination electrode can accommodate.The remaining four cells will be sent to an independent test facility designatedby DOE.6. Demonstrate scale-up of the chosen technologies: (1) build six full-sizeEV cells (150-200 Ah capacity) and (2) upon approval from DOE, build eightfull-size 6-volt modules for delivery.7. Prepare a detailed weight and cost analysis of the technology used intasks 3 and 5. The analysis shall highlight costly materials and manufacturingareas. This analysis shall identify and address the high-cost aspects ofmass production process (due to high labor requirements, expensive equipment,low production rates, and/or low yields).<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note:</T4> Any hazardous waste produced or the handling of hazardousmaterial must be handled in accordance with applicable EPA and/or OSHAregulations.
