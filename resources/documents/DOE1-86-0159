The paper subsequently addresses someof the more important aspects of interpreting the national standard ANSI/ASMENQA-1 in pure research environments like Fermilab. Highlights of thisdiscussion include, what is hermeneutics and why are hermeneutical considerationsrelevant for QA, a critical analysis of NQA-1 focussing on teleologicalaspects of the standard, a description of the hermeneutical approachto NQA-1 used at Fermilab which attempts to capture the true intentsof the document without violating the deeply ingrained traditions ofquality standards and peer review that have been foundational to theoverall success of the paradigms of high-energy physics.</TEXT></DOC>
