New Zealand was absent for the third straight year as a resultof its ban against visits by nuclear-armed or nuclear-poweredwarships and the U.S. refusal to confirm or deny which vessels areatomic.   Secretary of State George Shultz and Defense Secretary FrankCarlucci represented the United States at the two-day meeting withthe Australian delegation, led by Foreign Minister Bill Hayden andDefense Minister Kim Beazley.   The meetings were held at Blair House, the restored U.S.presidential guest residence facing the White House acrossPennsylvania Avenue.   Beazley told reporters after his arrival in Washington heconsiders it ``very important to hold open the possibility'' ofbringing New Zealand back nto the alliance. But he said he saw nodevelopment ``in either New Zealand or U.S. policy pointing tocompromise'' of the port visit dispute.   Australia had criticized U.S. farm supports at previous annualmeetings and was expected to do it again this year. Prime MinisterBob Hawke, visiting Washington last week, said despite being ``afirst class ally,'' Australia gets second class treatment from theUnited States on trade matters.   Subsidized U.S. wheat exports have reduced the Australian shareof the world wheat market from 20 percent to 12 percent during thelast three years, Hawke said. He warned that any further impactcould ``corrode'' Australian public opinion against America.</TEXT></DOC>
