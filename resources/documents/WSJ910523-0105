By emerging as one of the most prominent Latinopoliticians in the nation, Ms. Molina is considered to beriding a wave of demographic change sweeping the Southwest.But within her supervisorial turf, in this city of 61,000east of downtown Los Angeles, another woman's politicalfortunes are linked to immigration trends. And the long-runprospects of Judy Chu, recently mayor and still on the CityCouncil, may be even greater.</LP><TEXT>   Ms. Chu, a Democrat, is angling for creation of alegislative district in the current reapportionment thatcould let her become the first Asian-American in thestatehouse in a decade. This, when Asians constitute 10% ofCalifornia's population.   A few Asian-Americans have broken into California politicsover the years -- two are currently congressmen, and one issecretary of state -- but none has been identified with anethnic constituency. One reason is that Asians have notcongregated in numbers sufficient to ensure the election ofone of their own to a major office. The 1990 census maychange that in respect to the San Gabriel Valley, a string ofoften-smoggy suburbs settled by middle-class whites decadesago. The area was turning Latino when the great Asian influxhit in the early 1980s.   Monterey Park, at the urban end of the valley, is the onlycity on the North American mainland with an Asian majority --57.5%. Its transition in the '80s was a wrenching one, markedby interethnic bitterness and electoral upheaval along withAsian-led commercial revitalization. As a general ally oflocal business interests against &quot;slow growth&quot; opposition,Ms. Chu may be establishing a broader -- and wealthier --base than some prospective party rivals.   Ms. Chu is no conservative. A 37-year-old Los Angelesnative, she came of age in the anti-Vietnam War movement,acquiring ethnic consciousness while protesting U.S.&quot;genocide against Asians.&quot; She'd grown up typicallyembarrassed over her immigrant mother's ways and rebelliousagainst attending &quot;Chinese school&quot; after her public classes.Now she bristles at attempts to stifle or put down holdoverethnic practices, including language. A psychology professorat East Los Angeles Community College, she's come to believethat &quot;to have assimilation at the end, you have to haveseparatism at the outset.&quot;   Involvement in a Chinese-American PTA led her to a schoolboard seat. Election to the City Council followed in 1988.She stepped, fighting, into a political brawl over whetherthe higher-density business and residential patterns of thenewcomers were disturbing what remained of suburbantranquillity in Monterey Park. An earlier backlash hadushered in a council that revised the general plan to blockshopping and housing complexes that seem tacky to traditionalAmerican tastes.   Ms. Chu says she's become a &quot;middleman&quot; between many ofthe Taiwan- or Hong Kong-born businessmen and the city staff,explaining such things as why deals in an officialredevelopment district (like many California cities, MontereyPark has a huge one) entail &quot;requests for proposals&quot; andcan't just be done with a few ready millions in cash.   But she's also acted to preserve a non-Asian presencealong the main drags in town. She holds that a &quot;laissez-fairephilosophy&quot; isn't suited to a mixed community in which sharpelbows can worsen friction.   Fiscal concerns also dominate city planning decisions hereand elsewhere in California, where property-tax revenue iscurbed. Asian banks &quot;love to come to Monterey Park,&quot; Ms. Chunotes, in part to handle big money transfers across thePacific. &quot;They would make it a little Switzerland if theycould.&quot; But banks pay scant local taxes, so they aren'twelcomed.   Ms. Chu herself isn't feeling much hospitality from theDemocratic Party these days. &quot;Blacks and progressive whites&quot;set its agenda, and Asians are given short shrift, shecomplains. In return, increasing numbers of Chinese,particularly the young and newer arrivals, don't identifythemselves with the party, she says.   Protectionism is a wedge issue for them, and not taxes andwelfare as with blue-collar whites, Ms. Chu finds. Sheherself wouldn't consider a switch to the GOP, citingcivil-rights and feminist rubs. But she watches Republicanspromote Asian candidacies and issues such ascollege-admission quotas while she waits for help inreapportioning an Asian district, still far from a surething.   If and when that opportunity arrives, this promisingpolitician for the '90s will have to address matters ofgreater magnitude than those in Monterey Park: health care,environment, civil and criminal law and other aspects of theCalifornia cost crush. But the local issues of signs andstreets and schools, especially in a laboratory of pluralism,are not trivial training. People care passionately aboutthem, and moreover actually expect elected officials to dosomething about them.   In this context, the most interesting numbers in MontereyPark concern voting. About 40% of those registered are Asian-- defying the notion that even upon reaching adultcitizenship, these new Americans won't be civically inclined.And Asians' turnout, Ms. Chu says, exceeds the city average.Her fortunes, and those of others in the young leadership ofthis nation's latest ethnic political bloc, rest on keepingthat interest up.   ---   Mr. Ferguson is a Los Angeles-based member of theJournal's editorial board.</TEXT></DOC>
