(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Next season's Republicancampaigners are being advised to take firm, early positions on theissue of abortion and run on them without hedging or compromising.   Party leaders said Republicans lost votes in the off-yearelections because they equivocated on abortion, not necessarilybecause they opposed it.   In addition, they said, Democrats claimed the middle ground onthe issue in defeating Republican candidates for governor ofVirginia and New Jersey a week ago.   ``Lesson learned,'' said Lee Atwater, the Republican nationalchairman. ``Never let your opponent define you or control the termsof debate.''   Atwater said that despite the 1989 defeats, GOP prospects aregood heading into next year's campaign for Congress and 36governors.   William Bennett, head man in the war on drugs, turned topolitics to advise Republican governors Monday that hedging onabortion could cost the votes and doom candidates in 1990.   ``I believe that Americans have a much higher degree oftolerance for honest differences, deeply held differences, thanthey have for trimmers and opportunists,'' Bennett told theRepublican Governors Association.   Vice President Dan Quayle said Republicans should take theirpositions on the basis of principle.   ``Once you articulate that viewpoint, do not start changing justbecause political winds may appear to be shifting,'' Quayle said.   That meshed with Atwater's counsel. Candidates, he said, mustdecide what they believe about the issue, state that positionclearly and refuse to equivocate, no matter the campaign pressures.   ``Our party is a big tent,'' Atwater said. ``We can house manyviews on many issues. Abortion is no exception.''   The party platform of 1988 opposes abortion, but GOP leaderssaid party candidates don't need to heed it.   ``The Republican Party is not a single-issue party,'' saidQuayle, an abortion foe. Quayle said there are many pro-choice GOPleaders, in Congress and among the governors.   Long term, Quayle said he doubts the issue will help or hurteither political party.   Party policy, and President Bush's veto-enforced opposition toabortion, align the party against the abortion rights activists whodemonstrated in Washington and elsewhere Sunday.   Bennett challenged them to demonstrate next time against drugsand the birth of cocaine-addicted babies.   ``I don't think that the record suggests that the pro-lifeposition is political suicide,'' he said. ``It wasn't politicalsuicide for Ronald Reagan when he ran. It wasn't political suicidefor George Bush when he ran. ...   ``We now have a situation ... where Molly Yard, president of theNational Organization for Women, stands up and says to us if youdare to run people who are pro life we will get someone else upagainst you and beat your brains out,'' Bennett said. ``How dareshe say that.''   Bennett said that ``as long as people are marching ... forrights and freedoms and protections, I would like to see a march onWashington to protest the birth of cocaine babies.''   He said people of all parties and persuasions could join thatdemonstration, suggesting it should include ``some of the folksfrom Hollywood and elsewhere'' who march for abortion rights.   Bennett said the demonstrators claim to be concerned about thepoor, so they ought to be protesting drugs.   ``Whatever number of people have been hurt in back-alleyabortions, it is a small number compared to the number of peoplewho have been hurt by back-alley drug sales,'' he said.   The governors were winding up their annual conference today withan education discussion featuring Roger B. Porter, Bush's assistantfor economic and domestic policy.</TEXT></DOC>
