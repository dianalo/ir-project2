Ghulam Ghous Amir, of the Afghan News Agency, said the threeSoviet soldiers were captured about a month ago in Baghlan provinceby the Hezb-e-Islami guerrillas.   Amir, a member of the guerrilla group, said Moscow agreed to theexchange but he could not say when it would take place. There was noimmediate reaction from Soviet officials in Moscow or in the Sovietmedia.   Soviet officials have said 312 Red Army soldiers are missing inaction, but Moslem guerrillas dispute the figure.   A member of Hezb-e-Islami, who spoke on condition of anonymity,said his group holds most of the Soviet POWs and has less than 50.   The Hezb-e-Islami group belongs to a loose U.S.-backed guerrillaalliance, which is based in Peshawar, Pakistan.   Guerrilla officials met with officials from the Soviet Embassy inPakistan at the end of November, reportedly to complete aprisoner-exchange deal.   In early December, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Yuli Vorontsovand guerrilla leaders met in Saudi Arabia.   A guerrilla spokesman, Abdul Hadi, says about 15,000 rebelfighters or their sympathizers are being held in prisons in theAfghan capital.   There has been no independent confirmation of that figure.   The Soviet Union sent troops and tanks into Afghanistan in 1979to support Afghanistan's Marxist government.   In April, the Soviet Union signed documents in Geneva agreeing towithdraw its troops by Feb. 15, 1988. Soviet officials suspended thewithdrawal last month after complaining that Pakistan and U.S.officials continue to arm the guerrillas. Nevertheless, the Soviets,who have withdrawn about half their 100,000 soldiers, said theywould complete the withdrawal on schedule.</TEXT></DOC>
