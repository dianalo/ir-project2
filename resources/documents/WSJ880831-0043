But sources close to the investigation confirmed that it is part of a much broader inquiry involving several electric utilities around the country that were audited by Arthur Andersen, the nation's biggest accounting firm. It isn't known if accounting for spare parts is an issue in the other cases.    In addition, the IRS and the Agriculture Department's inspector general are investigating utilities that have received more than $4 billion in government-guaranteed loans. A federal grand jury also is looking into Southern, other utilities and Arthur Andersen.    According to an affidavit filed in federal court here, officials of Southern's Georgia Power Co. unit discovered in 1982 that they had been accounting improperly for certain spare parts, and realized that if they told the IRS about it the company would be liable for &quot;many millions of dollars&quot; of additional taxes. Rather than pay the money, the document alleges, the officials set up an illegal &quot;off-the-books&quot; accounting system that avoided about $50 million in taxes and penalties, according to an IRS computation.    Sources close to the investigation said the total amount could be much higher, because other Southern subsidiaries also are allegedly involved.    The affidavit says, &quot;There also appears to be ample evidence to indicate that key personnel of both the audit department and the tax department of Arthur Andersen andamp; Co. had knowledge of the scheme to defraud the Internal Revenue Service.&quot;    Georgia Power Chairman Robert W. Scherer said at a news conference, &quot;The information contained in this document, if true, is shocking to me personally.&quot; He added, &quot;I want to state to you as plainly as I can that deliberate wrongdoing will not be tolerated at Georgia Power Co.,&quot; and he vowed to &quot;get to the bottom of this matter.&quot;    Arthur Andersen said in a statement, &quot;Based on the affidavit provided by the IRS to the courts, it would be insane to believe for even a moment that Arthur Andersen andamp; Co. would risk damage to its reputation by engaging in any efforts to deceive or defraud any person, any organization or any government. These allegations by the IRS are preposterous.&quot; It added, &quot;We resent and categorically deny these challenges to our integrity.&quot;    Neither Southern nor Arthur Andersen would comment further.    According to the affidavit, Georgia Power officials set up a secret inventory system using a desktop personal computer. They also took records home with them so that they wouldn't be found if the IRS came to call, the affidavit said.    IRS agents did search Georgia Power's offices last week, seizing documents and computer files. IRS agents also obtained a search warrant for the Atlanta home of Timothy L. Fallaw, a former IRS agent who is Southern's director of taxes, but found no documents there, court records show.    The IRS was alerted to the alleged spare-parts scheme by a person who, in exchange for a non-prosecution agreement, secretly tape-recorded his conversations with Georgia Power officials, according to the affidavit. The person wasn't identified.    At a news conference, U.S. Attorney Robert L. Barr said he expected more search warrants to be issued. And he stressed that the investigation extends far beyond Georgia Power. The Department of Agriculture and the IRS are known to be investigating Oglethorpe Power Corp. in Atlanta and Sunflower Electric Cooperative of Hays, Kan. Authorities are &quot;right smack dab in the middle of a very long and complex investigation,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
