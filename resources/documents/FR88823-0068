This statement updates the policy in effectsince 1978 to more clearly distinguish significance considerations fromquestions of suitability, feasibility, and management alternatives. Theproposed policy outlines four basic significance factors that apply tonatural, cultural, and recreation resources and provides examples for eachcategory of resource. This approach replaces the separate criteria fornational recreation areas that appeared in the 1978 policies. The revisedpolicy outlines criteria for new national park system units, but does notaddress what designation (park, monument, seashore, recreation area) wouldbe most appropriate. Introductory material in the 1978 policy has beencondensed to avoid duplication with other chapters in the new managementpolicies. The new policy statement also includes a definition and criteriafor affiliated areas, responding to directions from Congress in Pub. L.100-336.The Service is hereby soliciting comment from any and all interested groupsor individuals on these policies. We urge you to be specific as to howthe policy might be changed or strengthened. All comments will be reviewedand, where appropriate, incorporated. The policies will remain on reviewfor 30 days. The revised final policy and an explanation of how commentswere addressed will be published in the <T4>Federal Register.</T4> These policies, in final form, will become apart of chapter 2 of the National Park Service Management Policies.<ITAG tagnum="6">Denis P. Galvin,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Acting Director.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="34">August 17, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">New Area Studies and Criteria</ITAG>The National Park Service (Park Service) plays a broad role in identifyingnationally significant natural, cultural, and recreational resources andassisting in their preservation both inside and outside the national parksystem. The areas managed by the National Park Service are only one partof a broader national system of special and protected areas managed byinnumerable federal, state, and local agencies and the private sector,and addition to the national park system is only one of many alternativesfor ensuring the preservation of significant national resources for publicenjoyment and benefit. A great variety of specially designated areas, includingnatural landmarks, historic landmarks, wild and scenic rivers, trails,wilderness areas, areas of critical environmental concern, biosphere reserves,and recreation areas, managed by the U.S. Forest Service, Fish and WildlifeService, Bureau of Land Management, other federal, state, county, and localagencies, Indian tribes, and the private sector, complete the broader nationalinventory.As directed by Congress, the National Park Service will study and monitorareas to determine if they are nationally signficant and if so, do theyhave potential for inclusion in the national park system. Planning forthe future of the national park system is guided by a framework of themesrepresenting all the aspects of America's natural and cultural heritage.Additions to the system recognize new understanding of natural resourcesand biological diversity, national recreational trends, and the continuingprogress of history. New area studies may be initiated within the Serviceor may be conducted in response to requests from Congress, other federal,state, or local agencies, or the private sector. The Service will reviewall proposals and provide advice about planning, studies, or other appropriateactions. Where formal new area studies are appropriate, the Service willestablish priorities and conduct studies as funds are available.To be eligible for favorable consideration as a unit of the national parksystem, an area must (1) possess nationally significant natural, cultural,or recreational resources, (2) be a suitable and feasible addition to thesystem, and (3) require direct Park Service management instead of alternativeprotection by other agencies or the private sector. These criteria aredesigned to ensure that the national park system includes the most outstandingexamples of the nation's natural, cultural, and recreational resources.They also recognize that inclusion in the national park system is not theonly option for preserving the nation's outstanding resources.Criteria for National SignificanceA natural, cultural, and recreational resource will be considered nationallysignificant if it meets all of the following criteria: It is an outstanding example of a particular type of resource.It possesses exceptional value or quality in illustrating or interpretingthe natural or cultural themes of our nation's heritage.It offers opportunities for recreation, public use, and enjoyment or forscientific study superior to other resources of the same type.It retains integrity as a true, accurate, and relatively unspoiled exampleof a resource.Examples of nationally significant natural resources include:An outstanding site that illustrates the characteristics of a geologiclandform or biotic area that is still widespread.A rare remnant geologic landform or biotic area of a type that was oncewidespread but is now vanishing due to human settlement and development.A geologic landform or biotic area that was extremely uncommon in the regionor nation prior to European settlement.A site possessing exceptional diversity of ecological components (species,communities, habitats) or geologic features (landforms, observable manifestationsof geologic processes).A site containing biotic species or communities whose natural distributionat that location makes them unusual (a relatively large population at thelimit of its range, or an isolated population).A site harboring a concentrated population of a rare plant or animal species,particularly one officially recognized as threatened or endangered.A critical refuge necessary for the continued survival of a species.A site containing rare or unusually abundant fossil deposits.An area with outstanding scenic qualities, such as dramatic topographicfeatures, unusual contrasts in landforms or vegetation, spectacular vistas,or other special landscape features.A site that is an invaluable ecological or geological benchmark due toan extensive and long-term record of research and scientific discovery.Nationally significant cultural resources include districts, sites, buildings,structures, or objects that possess exceptional value or quality in illustratingor interpreting our heritage and that possess a high degree of integrityof location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association.Examples are resources that:Are associated with events that have made a significant contribution toand are identified with, or that outstandingly represent, the broad nationalpatterns of United States history and from which an understanding and appreciationof those patterns may be gained.Are associated importantly with the lives of persons nationally significantin the history of the United States.Represent some great idea or ideal of the American people.Embody the distinguishing characteristics of an architectural type specimen,exceptionally valuable for study of a period, style, or method of constructionor that represent a significant, distinctive, and exceptional entity whosecomponents may lack individual distinction.Are composed of integral parts of the environment not sufficiently significantby reason of historical association or artistic merit to warrant individualrecognition but collectively compose an entity of exceptional historicalor artistic significance, or outstandingly commemorate or illustrate away of life or culture.Have yielded or may be likely to yield information of major scientificimportance by revealing new cultures or by shedding light upon periodsof occupation over large areas of the United States.Ordinarily cemeteries, birthplaces, graves of historic figures, propertiesowned by religious institutions or used for religious purposes, structuresthat have been moved from their original locations, reconstructed historicbuildings, and properties that have achieved significance within the past50 years are not considered appropriate for addition to the national parksystem unless they have transcendent importance, unless they possess inherentarchitectural or artistic significance, or unless no other site associatedwith that theme remains.Examples of nationally significant recreation resources include:A natural or cultural feature providing a special setting for a varietyof recreational activities different from those available at the localor regional level.A spacious area located near a major population center with the potentialto provide exceptional recreational opportunities and to serve visitorsfrom around the nation rather than solely from the immediate vicinity.An area that protects a unique recreation resource that is scarce and disappearingin a multi-state region, such as an outstanding recreational river, a uniquemaritime environment or coastline, or a unique scenic area.A unique combination of natural, cultural, and recreational resources thatcollectively offer outstanding opportunities for public use and enjoymenteven though each feature might not individually be considered nationallysignificant.Suitability and FeasibilityTo be suitable for addition to the national park system an area must representa theme or type of recreational resource that is not already adequatelyrepresented in the national park system. Adequacy of representation willbe determined on a case-by-case basis by evaluating the proposed additionin relation to other units in the national park system.To be feasible as a new unit of the national park system an area must beof sufficient size and appropriate configuration to ensure long-term protectionof resources and to accommodate public use, and it must have potentialfor efficient administration at a reasonable cost. Important feasibilityfactors include landownership, acquisition costs, access, threats to theresource, and staff or development requirements.Management AlternativesStudies of potential new park units will evaluate an appropriate rangeof management alternatives, which may include:Continued management by states, local governments, Indian tribes, the privatesector, or other federal agencies.Technical or financial assistance to others through established NPS programsor special projects.Management by others as a designated national natural landmark, nationalhistoric landmark, national wild and scenic river, national trail, biospherereserve, state or local park, or other specially designated and protectedarea.Cooperative management, including designation as an affiliated area.New additions to the national park system will not usually be recommendedif other arrangements can provide adequate protection for the resourceand opportunities for public enjoyment.Affiliated AreasCongress and the Secretary of the Interior have given special recognitionto a small group of nationally significant areas that are affiliated withbut not technically part of the national park system. These affiliatedareas are protected and managed by other organizations and agencies, butthey have some formal financial or legal relationship with the NationalPark Service, often including technical or financial assistance beyondwhat is normally available to national landmarks.To be for eligible for affiliated status, areas must meet the same criteriafor national significance as national landmarks or potential units of thenational park system. However, affiliated areas are not necessarily suitableor feasible as new units of the system. Designation as an affiliated areais a management alternative appropriate for nationally significant resourcesthat can be most effectively protected by others through a cooperativearrangement with the National Park Service. Although the National ParkService does not have direct management responsibility for affiliated areas,the Service usually maintains oversight responsibilities to assure thatmanagement and operations meet Park Service standards.<ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 88-19072 Filed 8-22-88; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4310-70-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
