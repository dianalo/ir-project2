The ``Silver Spring monkeys,'' named after the Maryland suburbwhere the primates were confiscated by police from a researchlaboratory in 1981, currently are being held in a Covington, La.,research center.   The House members asked Bush to direct the Department of Healthand Human Services to transfer the monkeys to a primate sanctuary.The department includes the National Institutes of Health, whichhas custody of the monkeys.   Rep. Robert C. Smith, R-N.H., who circulated the letter, said heand others in Congress have worked unsuccessfully for three yearson a compromise with animal-rights groups and NIH. Althoughanimal-rights groups agreed to a proposal for most of the monkeysto be sent to a santuary, NIH refused, he said.   NIH says three of the monkeys have deteriorated to the pointthat ``human considerations dictate euthanasia.'' The three werescheduled for euthanasia last December, NIH said, but a Louisianastate court issued a restraining order stopping the action at therequest of animal-rights groups.   People Protecting Primates, a coalition of 80 organizations,applauded the letter, calling the monkeys ``political prisoners,symbolic of the debate over animal testing.''   NIH had no comment, said spokesman Robert Schreiber.</TEXT></DOC>
