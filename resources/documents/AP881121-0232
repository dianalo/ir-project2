A good example is Joan Crawford in herAcademy Award-winning ``Mildred Pierce.'' The lone exception isKatharine Hepburn; it's hard to imagine her mothering a gaggle ofsqualling kids.   Diane Keaton began her transition as the career woman whoinherited an infant in the successful ``Baby Boom.'' Now she turnsdramatic in ``The Good Mother'' as a divorced mother caught in acustody battle with her former husband.   Based on the best-selling novel by Sue Miller and written byMichael Bortman, the film describes the life and background of thesingle mother, who lives on returns from a humdrum laboratory joband the grudging child support payments of her ex, played by JamesNaughton. Flashbacks disclose the reason for her repressedsexuality; her family had been dominated by an unfeeling,dictatorial father (Ralph Bellamy).   Keaton meets Liam Neeson, an attractive, free-living artist whoreleases her inhibitions with unbridled sex. The idyll is destroyedwhen Naughton appears to claim his 6-year-old daughter. In thecustody suit he accuses the couple of having intercourse in the samebed where the girl was sleeping.   Also, because Keaton sought sexual openness for her daughter,Neeson allowed the girl to satisfy her curiosity by touching hispenis when she saw him stepping out of the shower. (This incident isnot portrayed in the film).   Keaton is represented in court by Jason Robards, who warns thather case is perilous. The trial is heart-wrenching, and the resultshould not be disclosed in a review.   Leonard Nimoy directed ``The Good Mother'' in an astoundingchange of pace from his last, ``Three Men and a Baby.'' There is nohumor in the new film, and some patrons may be turned off by itsseriousness.   The filmmakers deserve credit for attempting a drama of complexsocial issues: the role of the single mother; the question of howfar sexual frankness should go. But the issues become clouded, andthe outcome lacks the emotional impact of ``Kramer vs. Kramer.''   Keaton is adept at portraying the mother's anguish, employing fewof her nervous mannerisms. The Irish actor Liam Neeson demonstrateshis star potential in an ambiguous role, and Teresa Wright offerswelcome humanity as Keaton's mother.   Arnold Glimcher produced the Touchstone film, which is rated Rbecause of language, sex scenes and adult subject matter. Runningtime: 103 minutes.   _ Bob Thomas, Associated Press Writer.</TEXT><TEXT>      ``Child's Play''      Weaving children into tales of terror and the supernaturalusually elevates the scare factor a decimal or two. Would we havebeen as horrified if Linda had been a 30-year-old instead of aschool girl in ``The Exorcist''? And Damien in ``The Omen'' sendsmore shivers up spines as a little boy than he does as a grownup.   In ``Child's Play,'' a 6-year-old takes on an evil doll.   Andy Barclay is a lonely lad until Chucky comes into his life.Chucky is all the rage, he's a Good Guy Doll and every little boyhas one. Chucky is just as cute as a button with his shock of redhair, coveralls, sneakers and wide innocent smile.   Chucky also is a malevolent mound of plastic whose soul is pureevil.   It is the soul of a sadistic murderer who learns enough of avoodoo ritual to zap out of his body as it lay dying in a toy storeand into the doll's so he can live forever and settle a few scores.   ``Child's Play'' is more than just an odyssey of revenge; it is achiller that will make you think twice about cuddling those uglylittle Cabbage Patch kids or visiting Barbie's townhouse.   Tom Holland (``Fright Night''), who also wrote the screenplaywith Don Mancini and John Lafia, plunges into the story with afast-break shootout in Chicago between the psychotic Charles Lee Ray(Brad Dourif) and police. Detective Mike Norris (Chris Sarandon)follows him into a toy store and slaughters Ray with a hail ofbullets. Ray, though, has one more trump card up his bloodied sleeve.   Cut to the Barclay home. Andy (Alex Vincent) is making breakfast(and a major mess) for his mom while he watches a Good Guyscommercial on television. It's his way of buttering her up so he canget a doll for his birthday. But mom, a struggling clerk in adepartment store, just can't afford it. Later that day, her friend,Maggie, takes her to a street peddler who's selling one for afraction of the actual price. It is, of course, the doll Rayclutched as he died.   Like most children in horror movies Andy perceives evil longbefore the grownups do, and knows that his life must depend on hisown wits.   Holland slowly develops the horror and first unleashes it whenMaggie (Dinah Manoff) baby-sits for Andy. After ordering Andy to bedand turning off the late night news, she's surprised to suddenlyhear the TV and see Chucky sitting in a chair before the set.   It's not quite the heartstopper the next few scenes turn out tobe. With her back to the hall, Maggie hears tiny footsteps rushingby. She thinks it's Andy. Silly woman. And like all baby-sitters inthese flicks, she's the first to go: Chucky hammers in her head andshe crashes through the sixth-floor window to the street below.   Andy tells his mother, Karen (Catherine Hicks), that Chucky toldhim Maggie deserved to die. She makes Chucky talk, but he only saysthe programmed words the manufacturer put in. Then Karen discoversthe batteries still in the doll's packing case! She sneaks a look atChucky's empty battery case, and with a turn almost as frighteningas Blair's head swirl in ``The Exorcist,'' Chucky snarls at Karenwith a demonic sneer and tells her exactly what he thinks of her.   The terror's afoot, climaxing in a scene that makes the Cuisinartbit in the ``Gremlins'' look like a picnic with Mary Poppins.   Holland reteams with Sarandon, who starred as the vampire in``Night Fright.'' Sarandon's so-called tough urban accent is forcedand a distraction from the action. Alex Vincent is adorable in hisfilm debut, with his deep voice. But the real star is Chucky, who'sfar more interesting than his human counterparts. Kevin Yagherdesigned and supervised the operation of the killer doll.   ``Child's Play'' will not go down in horror movie history, but itcertainly has its moments.
