(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Richard Dortch, once JimBakker's top deputy at the PTL ministry, arrived Friday at thefederal prison camp on this base to begin serving an eight-yearsentence for fraud and conspiracy.   Dortch, 58, pleaded guilty in August, days before he and Bakkerwere to go on trial in Charlotte, N.C.   Under a plea bargain, Dortch testified against Bakker at hisformer boss' trial. He also appeared in December before a grandjury that later indicted the Rev. Sam Johnson, a former PTLexecutive, for perjury.   Bakker is serving a 45-year sentence in a federal prison inMinnesota.   Dortch will be eligible for parole after serving about 2{ years.He also was fined $200,000. U.S. District Judge Robert Potter hasyet to hear a motion from Dortch's lawyers for a reduction in hissentence.   Dortch will be in an admission and orientation program for abouttwo weeks before he is assigned a job at the camp or elsewhere onthe base about 40 miles east of Pensacola, said warden Willie Scott.   Dortch is the lastest on a long list of celeberity inmates whohave served time at the unfenced, minimum-security camp.   Others have included Watergate figure E. Howard Hunt, fashionmagnates Aldo Gucci and Albert Nipon and former baseball pitcherLaMarr Hoyt. Politicians and judges also have been Eglin inmates,including former U.S. Rep. Richard Kelly, R-Fla., who was convictedin the Abscam scandal, and former Maryland Gov. Marvin Mandel.   Most of the 800 or so inmates on the 28-acre compound arewhite-collar criminals and low-level drug dealers.   The camp has been derided by critics as a ``country club''prison and nicknamed ``Club Fed.''   Two Air Force sergeants recently pleaded guilty to accepting oragreeing to accept bribes to take an inmate to nearby motel for arendezvous with his wife.   Prison officials dispute the country club image.   ``These are non-violent people from a variety of backgrounds;not all of them are big shots by any means,'' Scott told TheAssociated Press last year. ``Most of them are serving shortsentences. And, since they aren't dangerous and we are located on amilitary base, we don't even need to have a fence around theplace.''   In addition to housekeeping jobs at the camp, prisoners workthroughout the base, primarily doing landscaping, Scott said.   Eglin is the nation's largest air base, covering 720 squaremiles.</TEXT></DOC>
