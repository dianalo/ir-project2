The area, known as the Golden Triangle, is notorious for growing poppies and is the source of a good chunk of the world's illicit opium and heroin.    In 1967, a three-sided opium war was fought just across the Mekong River in Laos. The prize was a 300-mule caravan carrying 16 metric tons of opium led by warlord Khun Sa. He battled an army of former Nationalist Chinese troops as well as Lao fighters backed by their country's air force, whose commander wanted to wrest control of the lucrative drug trade.    Twenty years later, it is tranquil here. Khun Sa survives in the inaccessible Burmese section, along with lesser opium warlords and a collection of communists and ethnic insurgencies in a no-man's land outside the control of any central government.    Given the area's reputation, the arch, erected by local officials several years ago to replace a simple wood sign, has been a good draw for tourists. &quot;People are naturally curious,&quot; says Narong Pornpiriyakulchai, director of the Tourism Authority of Thailand's Chiang Mai office.    The main activity of visitors to the site has been to photograph the arch to show that they got this far. But a recently opened opium museum nearby offers exhibits on the history of opium cultivation and trading as well as the poppy's use and abuse. Thai officials contend the museum is a good educational tool. To discourage drug abuse, it displays grim photographs of wasted addicts.    Good weather has made the overall Golden Triangle crop harvested in recent months a large one. But most is coming from the chaotic Burmese portion of the triangle because Thailand has succeeded in recent years in cutting production.    Opium warlord Khun Sa, who currently is feeling the heat from Burmese government troops, boasted at a press conference in December that production in areas under his control could expand to 900 tons this year from 600 tons a year earlier. Although Thai officials believe those figures are grossly exaggerated, they fear that total triangle production might have been 600 tons -- enough to supply all the world's heroin addicts. </TEXT></DOC>
