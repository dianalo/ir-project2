(Mach operating system interprocesscommunication and virtual memory management)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Appleton, Elaine L.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>The Mach operating system was developed by a Carnegie-MellonUniversity (CMU, Pittsburgh, PA) team to providehardware-independent virtual memory management, interprocesscommunications, networking, and parallel processing support on allsizes of computers.andP;  The operating system is intended to be acommon platform for other operating systems and programminglanguages.andP;  There has only been limited commercial support forMach, but the Open Software Foundation (OSF) is apparentlyplanning to integrate Mach's virtual memory-management scheme intoOSF's OSF/1 version of UNIX.andP;  Mach's virtual memory management isimplemented as a set of primitives within the kernel to maximizemachine independence.andP;  Mach's message-oriented interprocesscommunications facilitates multiple collaborating processes in amultiprocessing, shared-memory environment.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Product:   Mach (Operating system) (design and construction).andO;Topic:     Memory ManagementCommunications ManagementSystem DesignSpecificationsUNIX-Like Operating Systems.andM;</DESCRIPT></DOC>
