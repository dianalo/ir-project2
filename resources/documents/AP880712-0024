It was the highest one-day casualtytoll in nearly a month.   After a weeklong closure, the military government reopenedPalestinian schools in the occupied West Bank on Monday.   But later, it ordered six schools shut through the end of theschool year, which will be in August this year because of earlierclosings.   Israeli officials have called the 800 schools in the West Bankflashpoints of violence.   In Arab east Jerusalem, Palestinians on Monday stoned fourIsraeli buses and firebombed a fifth, causing minor damage. Policesaid an Arab woman was struck by a stone, and two Arabs werearrested.   A top Israeli official denied charges by ABC News that Israelisecurity agents impersonated ABC News personnel in a ploy todeceive and arrest a West Bank Arab.   Also Monday, the Supreme Court rejected requests by Timemagazine and the Reuters news agency that it order the army toreturn confiscated photographs of the March shooting death of anIsraeli soldier.   The worst violence erupted Monday in Nablus, the West Bank'slargest city.   Hospital officials there said an Arab youth was killed and 13wounded when soldiers opened fire on demonstrators in severalclashes. The army said it had reports of one dead and nine wounded.   An army spokeswoman said the disturbances erupted after thefuneral of an elderly Nablus man who died of natural causes. Wheninciters spread rumors that the man was killed by army gunfire,residents took to the streets, burning tires and throwing bricksand stones at troops from rooftops, she said.   Arab reports said the riots erupted after troops shot and killed17-year-old Sares Anabtawi in a clash. Officials at Al IttihadHospital said Anabtawi died of a gunshot wound in the chest.   In subsequent clashes, seven Palestinians suffered gunshotwounds and 15 were beaten by troops, said Ittihad officials.   At St. John's Hospital, also in Nablus, six Palestinians weretreated for gunshot wounds, including one who was in seriouscondition with a bullet wound in his chest, hospital officials said.   In the West Bank village of Anabta, troops fired on students whohurled rocks and empty bottles at them after classes let out, thearmy said.   Ittihad officials identified the victim as 16-year-old HassanAddas and said he was hit by three bullets in the chest.   The deaths brought to 220 the number of Palestinians killedsince the Dec. 8 start of the uprising against Israel's 21-yearoccupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Four Israelis have alsodied.   Monday's casualty toll was the highest for a single day sinceJune 17, when two Palestinians were killed and 18 wounded during anarmy raid of the West Bank village Beit Furik near Nablus.   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's aide Avi Pazner said officialsinvestigated the ABC charges and ``found no evidence that Israelisecurity personnel impersonated ABC News persons in arresting aPalestinian Arab'' last month.   Pazner said he informed ABC News president Roone Arledge of theresults. Arledge had protested to Shamir last week, demanding aninvestigation.   Dean Reynolds, ABC's Israel correspondent, said Monday: ``ABCstands by its story. The facts were corroborated by informedIsraeli sources.''   The network reported last week that Nizar Dakdouk of Salfitvillage in the West Bank was arrested by Israelis posing as ABCNews personnel, and it had learned ``the impostors were members ofthe Israeli secret security service Shin Bet.''   In rejecting the demand by Time and Reuters for release of theconfiscated film, the Supreme Court said authorities are entitledto seize material gathered by reporters if it can help solve acrime, Israel's Itim news agency reported.   Troops seized the film after Sgt. Moshe Katz was shot and killedin the West Bank city of Bethlehem on March 20. The army said atthe time the photographs might help investigators track down theassailant.   Itim said the two news organizations sought to drop their appealafter the army returned the rolls of film on its own, but theSupreme Court refused and issued its ruling Monday.</TEXT></DOC>
