(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Democrat Michael Dukakis blamed theReagan administration Saturday for the Pentagon contracting uproar,quoting an old Greek saying that ``the fish rots from the headfirst.''   ``It starts from the top,'' the Democratic presidential nomineesaid.   Dukakis stepped up his assault on President Reagan and VicePresident George Bush, his certain Republican opponent in the fall,at a stop in Louisville, Ky., where he spoke to about 5,000 peopleat a large outdoor rally in a downtown plaza.   Dukakis was concluding a seven-state tour with stops in twotobacco states, Kentucky and North Carolina, before returning hometo Boston Saturday night.   Bush, who is pondering the selection of a running mate andawaiting nomination at the Republican National Convention in NewOrleans in two weeks, did not campaign Saturday.   In Chicago, Jesse Jackson said his unsuccessful presidential bidwas a victory for America's disenfranchised, opening the politicalprocess and blazing a trail that would lead one day to a blackoccupying the White House.   In his first public appearance since the Democratic NationalConvention in Atlanta, Jackson told an overflow gathering atOperation PUSH, the civil-rights organization he helped found,Jackson also called Dukakis</TEXT><TEXT>   a``viable alternative'' to Bush.   Jackson drew a hearty ovation when he said, ``Dukakis pledged tonot bring shame to the White House. Bush does not recognize shameat the White House.''   Dukakis attacked sharply on the Pentagon procurement problemwhen questioned about this at a news conference following hisLouisville rally with Kentucky Gov. Wallace Wilkinson and Sen,Wendell Ford.   Dukakis said the alleged bribery and other abuses in connectionwith the awarding of defense contracts seemed to be``fundamentally'' a problem of people rather than process. TheReagan administration's approach to public service was to blame, hesaid.   ``If you're going to have an administration that takes integrityand honesty and effective management seriously, that begins at thetop,'' he said. ``If an administration comes to Washington with acontempt for public service, we shouldn't be surprised that thepeople it attracts in government share that contempt, who look atgovernment service as something that you do for a year and a halfor two before you go out and make a half a million dollars.''   Asked if he blamed Reagan and Bush personally for allegedmisdeeds by Pentagon contractors, consultants and administrators,Dukakis responded:   ``There's an old Greek saying, and I suspect the Italians havethe same one: `You know, the fish rots from the head first.' Itstarts from the top.''   The son of Greek immigrants, Dukakis frequently uses Greekphrases and speaks in Greek before audiences with similarbackgrounds.   Under investigation are allegations that defense contractors andconsultants, many of them former military men, bribed Pentagonofficials for contracting details that could be vital in winningcontracts worth billions of dollars.   Dukakis had attacked the Republicans on the Pentagon problem inspeeches through the Midwest a day earlier, saying he would not``surrender our national security to greed and corruption.''   At the news conference, he said he did not expect the presidentto know everyting going on in his administration. But he said ifthe president picks good people and moves quickly to dismiss anywho violate ethical standards, ``this kind of problem is lesslikely to fester and grow and become almost an epidemic in youradministration, which is what's happened.''   Dukakis also jabbed at Bush in his speech, saying if elected hewould be ``our nation's No. 1 advocate'' for education, ``not justin an election year but every year.''   That was a reference to Bush's claim to want to be ``theeducation president.''   While in Kentucky, a state dependent on both coal and tobacco,Dukakis expressed support for greater use of coal for producingelectricity. He also voiced support for the federal tobacco pricesupport program in its current form, which is designed to supportitself from fees charged to farmers, and said he supported usinggeneral tax dollars to compensate tobacco growers hit by drought.   When asked about tobacco, however, Dukakis first replied bysaying he would try to get his wife Kitty ``to rid herself of thehabit'' of smoking. He quickly added, ``I'm just kidding.''   Dukakis also repeated his vow to make no concessions toterrorists to gain release of hostages, such as those being held inLebanon. ``The consequences will be incalculable,'' he said.   ``You use diplomacy but you never ever make concessions,'' hesaid.   Later in Raleigh, N.C., Dukakis spoke to about 4,000 peopleinside a sweltering State Fairgrounds arena and repeated the themeshe stressed throughout his seven-state, three-day campaign swing:investing public and private money to create new jobs, improvededucation, and affordable child care for working parents.   He called for more aid for college students and said ``thatsupport should include our historically black colleges anduniversities as well,'' noting that Jesse Jackson attended NorthCarolina Aandamp;T State University, one of the state's predominantlyblack institutions.   Dukakis met privately with former North Carolina leaders of theJackson and Albert Gore Jr. campaigns in the state. In a gesture ofunity, Dukakis joined upraised hands with prominent state leadersof those campaigns, former U.S. Attorney H.M. Michaux and formerGov. Jim Hunt, as well as with the candidate for governor, Lt. Gov.Bob Jordan.   During the meeting, Dukakis said, ``I can honestly say to youthat I don't recall when there has been more genuine unity in theDemocratic Party than we have right now.'' A short time later, hesaid that ``we want to involve every single one of you in thiseffort.''   Dukakis was met in Louisville and Raleigh with small groups ofprotesters, most carrying anti-abortion or Bush signs, just as hehas at nearly every stop since leaving the convention in Atlanta.Dukakis said he was unbothered. ``It's democracy,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
