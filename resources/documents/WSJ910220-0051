In U.S. futures trading, crude oil for March deliverybroke through the psychologically important level of $20 abarrel before recovering slightly. It settled at $20.07 abarrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, down 81 centsfrom the previous close.</LP><TEXT>   The catalyst in the decline was the Soviet Union's MiddleEast peace plan, which reached Saddam Hussein of Iraqyesterday. Both the U.S. and Britain appeared to reject theSoviet proposal, and that helped oil markets to rallyslightly, if only briefly. Still, oil-market participantsgenerally acted on the theory that the war won't last muchlonger and that prices will tumble when it ends because ofhigh production by the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries and a glut of crude oil.   &quot;Each day we move closer to peace is a day the market willgo down,&quot; said Peter Beutel, director of the energy group atPegasus Econometric.   Some pricing volatility had been expected yesterday infutures trading of the March crude contract because itexpires today. But the April crude contract also was downyesterday by 15 cents a barrel to $18.79.   These declines followed drops of $1.44 a barrel for theMarch crude and $1.55 a barrel for the April contract intrading Friday after Saddam Hussein's offer of a conditionalwithdrawal of Iraqi troops from Kuwait. The New YorkMercantile Exchange was closed Monday for the holiday.   Fuels futures generally followed crude down. Heating oilfor March delivery fell 1.69 cents a gallon to settle at60.63 cents.   Also, several more U.S. petroleum refineries reduced theprices they will pay in the field for crude oil by 25 centsto $1.25 a barrel. That left field postings for West TexasIntermediate, the benchmark crude, between $18.75 and $19.75a barrel.   Meanwhile, some OPEC oil ministers apparently intend tomeet Monday in Vienna, where OPEC is based, to plan astrategy to defend against the price collapse widely expectedonce the war ends.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Export sales to the Soviet Union anddry weather in Brazil supported soybean futures prices,although the bellwether March contract closed well below itshigh for the day. March soybean futures gained 1.25 cents abushel to close at $5.7475, after trading as high as $5.80.The Soviet Union bought 7.3 million bushels of soybeans, theAgriculture Department said, with a portion of the $58million in export credits allocated Friday for suchpurchases. The government allocated an additional $9 millionfor the purchase of almonds. The total of $67 million inallocations are part of $100 million in export creditsremaining from a $1 billion export package approved byPresident Bush earlier this year. Analysts said that atcurrent prices the Soviets could buy an additional 1.5million bushels of soybeans before using up the exportcredits. Soybean futures prices came off their highs in partbecause the Soviets were buying soybeans, not soybean oil ormeal. &quot;That means they don't have an immediate need forprotein,&quot; one analyst said. Corn futures posted only modestgains, partly because many traders had speculated that the$100 million in credits would go mostly for the purchase ofcorn. March corn futures added 0.25 cent a bushel to close at$2.3975. March wheat futures fell two cents a bushel to closeat $2.5450.                                                                                                          SUGAR: Futures prices strengthened. Sugar for Marchdelivery finished 0.31 cent a pound higher at 8.72 cents.Sandra Kaul, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers, tied therise to short-covering, or investors buying contracts tooffset their previous bets that prices would fall. The buyingwas triggered when sugar prices didn't fall sharply, as someinvestors had expected, after a report last week projected abigger surplus of world supplies this season. ArthurStevenson, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities, linkedthe rise to tightness in immediately available supplies,generally from the Far East and particularly from Thailand.Also contributing to the rise was the prospect for peace inthe Middle East, he added. A peace settlement would normalizeshipping to the area, and buying by Middle Eastern countrieswould pick up, he explained.                                                                                                          ORANGE JUICE: Futures prices fell in reaction tomilder-than-expected weather over the weekend. After openingat $1.1375 a pound, the day's low, orange juice for Marchdelivery recovered somewhat to end at $1.1505, off 3.35cents. Robert Terry of the Florida Agricultural StatisticsService said weekend temperatures dipped into the low 30s,which wasn't low enough to damage oranges or trees. Someforecasts had predicted temperatures in the low 20s, henoted. High winds killed some early bloom on the trees, headded, but that won't affect orange production. &quot;Basically itwas a nonevent,&quot; he said. Prices recently had been holdingmore firmly than in past years on the expectation of a latefreeze, said Sandra Kaul, an analyst at Shearson LehmanBrothers. Now that a freeze seems less likely, and withorange juice inventories at record levels, Ms. Kaul predictedprices would continue to be under pressure in the comingweeks. Stephen Platt, an analyst at Dean Witter in Chicago,however, said he expects orange juice prices to reach $1.30to $1.35 by summer. The Brazilian crop will come in lowerthan what the market is currently expecting and demand withinthe U.S. could pick up as retail prices fall, he predicted.</TEXT></DOC>
