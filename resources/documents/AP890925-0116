(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An era ended Monday with the lastNASA launch of an unmanned rocket from this spaceport, whereresponsibility for sending payloads into orbit is being turned overto private industry after 400 liftoffs in 31 years.   An Atlas-Centaur vaulted skyward at 4:56 a.m. with a $125million communications satellite to link military commands withland, sea and air forces and for use by the president in times ofcrisis.   For now on, when NASA needs an unmanned rocket, it will have tobuy launch services from McDonnell Douglas, General Dynamics andMartin Marietta.   The space agency will continue to launch manned space shuttlesfrom Cape Canaveral, where NASA got its start and where it haslaunched nearly all of its rockets.   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has oneunmanned rocket left for launch, but it will carry its payload, ascientific satellite, from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.The launch is scheduled for November.   So far, the space agency has seven contracts for privatelaunches. The first, of a scientific satellite, is scheduled forJune from one of four launch pads turned over to companies.   ``It's always sad to see the end of an era,'' said James L.Womack, NASA director of expendable launch vehicles.   ``There's a certain element of sadness, but the things we havedone have been fabulous,'' said Joseph Mahon, the agency'sassistant administrator for space flight.   Monday's unmanned launch was the 448th for NASA, dating from aThor Able that lifted off Oct. 11, 1958, hoisting the Pioneer 1probe toward a flyby of the moon. It failed, as did several otherearly launches. But the agency's overall success rate is betterthan 90 percent.   ``We have had a successful mission today; the satellite is nowbeing tracked by spacecraft controllers after a flawless rideaboard its Atlas-Centaur rocket,'' said launch commentator LisaMalone.   The agency stopped buying Atlas-Centaur, Delta and other rocketsearly in the 1980s, opting to launch payloads from the shuttle onceit exhausted its backlog of space boosters.   Officials admitted after the Challenger exploded in 1986 that itwas a mistake to rely on only one launch vehicle. Following thataccident, then-President Reagan directed NASA to get out of thebusiness of launching commercial payloads and encouraged governmentsupport of private companies that wanted to provide launch services.   Among NASA's unmanned rocket achievements are:   The Mariner, Viking, Pioneer and Voyager missions to theplanets; 42 weather satellites; the Ranger, Surveyor and LunarOrbiter probes that scouted the moon in advance of Americanastronaut landings there; 94 communications satellites; scores ofscientific payloads, and dozens of unmanned test launches for theMercury, Gemini and Apollo man-in-space projects.   The Atlas-Centaur, which made its 68th appearance Monday, andthe Delta, with 184 liftoffs, have been the workhorses of NASA'sfleet. Both have a success rate of more than 95 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
