In New York, a spokesman for the state's Budget Divisionsaid the deficit for the year beginning next July 1 could bedouble a previous $1.8 billion forecast, reflecting the weaknational economy and eroding state tax revenue. The state'scurrent fiscal year is projected to end with a $689 milliondeficit. An election-year budget gap could have a bearing ona possible presidential run by Gov. Mario Cuomo.</LP><TEXT>   Meanwhile, in California, which is already looking at a $3billion funding gap for fiscal 1993, the state FinanceDepartment said things could get much worse before the decadeis out.   The department said lagging tax revenue and continuingpopulation gains, especially among immigrants andminority-group citizens, could yield a $20 billion gap,according to Steve Olsen, the department's deputy director.The state has about 30 million residents, and the populationis expected to grow by a further 6.3 million before 2000, thedepartment said. Growth in the student population is expectedto more than double the growth rate of the workingpopulation.   The California report comes as a series of tax increasesand program cuts enacted to close a $14 billion gap for thecurrent fiscal year is proving inadequate. A bipartisancommission on state finance projects that the state willfinish the current year with an estimated $2 billion spendinggap. The commission says the shortfall stems from ananticipated $2.3 billion drop in revenue because of therecession and $800 million in unexpected costs from risinghealth and welfare assistance caseloads, among otheritems-figures that would overwhelm the state's $1.2 billionbudget reserve.</TEXT></DOC>
