CIG states that this filing is made in compliance with the requirementsof the Commission's Opinion Nos. 290 and 290A, as well as the July 1, 1988letter order and the November 29, 1988 Order Denying Appeal From StaffAction. According to CIG the instant tariff sheets reflect establishmentof a Modified Fixed Variable form of rate design and make other rate designand tariff changes for prospective application. CIG states that it has sought judicial review of the requirement that itestablish a modified fixed variable form of rate design and that it reservesits right to adjust the rates reflected in the instant filing consistentwith the ultimate outcome of the pending appeal. CIG further states that the modified fixed variable form of rate designreflected in the instant filing is predicated upon D-2 nominations submittedby its customers pursuant to Opinion No. 290-A. CIG notes that it soughtrehearing of that requirement of Opinion No. 290-A, which the Commissiondenied in Opinion No. 290-B in which CIG was also required to make certaintariff modifications. CIG has appealed Opinion No. 290-B and states thatit reserves the right to adjust the instant filing to reflect the ultimatedisposition of that appeal. CIG states the instant filing eliminates Rate Schedule PR-1 in its entiretyfor the locked in period July 14, 1987 through August 3, 1988. CIG states that it has complied with the requirement of Opinion Nos. 290and 290-A that it eliminate its fixed cost minimum commodity bill applicableto Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America. Because CIG has appealed thisaspect of Opinion Nos. 290 and 290-A CIG protests the requirement thatit make this filing pending final judicial resolution of the minimum billissue. Should it prevail in the pending litigation, such that the minimumbill is not required to be eliminated, CIG reserves its right to withdrawthe portion of this filing eliminating the minimum bill, and to substitutein lieu thereof tariff sheets: (1) Reflecting continuation of the minimumbill, (2) making appropriate rate adjustments consistent with continuationof the fixed cost minimum commodity bill, and (3) establishing any surchargethat may be required. CIG further states that it reserves the right tofile tariff sheets reflecting elimination of the minimum bill volumes andreflecting the resultant reallocation of costs based upon the eliminationof the minimum bill provision at such time as the mandate issues in therecent decision in <T3>ANR Pipeline Co., </T3>v. <T3>FERC, </T3>Nos. 87-1340 and 88-1030 (D.C. Cir. December 13, 1988),and to reflect an appropriate surcharge to recover reallocated costs retroactiveto the effective date of the rates contained in the instant filing. CIG states that because the issue of whether the minimum bill should beeliminated retroactively rather than prospectively is pending judicialreview, CIG states that it reserves the right to establish an appropriatesurcharge retroactive to whatever retroactive date that the minimum billmay ultimately be required to be eliminated. CIG states that because other aspects of Opinion Nos. 290 and 290-A arepending judicial review CIG states that it reserves the right to modifythe instant filing based upon the ultimate outcome of such pending judicialreview or final Commission action.
