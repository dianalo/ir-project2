West Bank residents closed shops and offices to protest thesudden increase in the number of Palestinians shot to death in theuprising against nearly 22 years of Israeli rule.   The teen-ager shot to death in the Gaza Strip was the 14thPalestinian killed by soldiers in a week, bringing the total to atleast 363 since the rebellion began Dec. 8, 1987. Fifteen Israelisalso have been slain.   Soldiers are allowed to fire plastic and rubber bullets morefreely under the new army policy, which also provides harsherpunishment for people throwing stones.   Tougher sentences were given Thursday, Israel radio reported.   It said two Palestinians from Ramallah in the West Bank receivedsentences of 16 months and 18 months in jail for throwing stones,which caused no damage, at an Israeli vehicle. Previously, the usualsentence for stone-throwing was four to five months.   The new policy has drawn criticism from the United States andleft-wing legislators in Israel.   PLO chairman Yasser Arafat said Israel is ``forgetting that ourpeople had decided from the beginning to continue the uprising untilthe end of the occupation, so let us have more confrontation againstthe Zionist occupation and the fascist hordes of murderoussettlers.''   ``In our steadfastness and faith, the enemy faces its inevitabledilemma, from which the way out is the retreat of its forces fromthe occupied lands,'' he said in a statement issued in Cyprus by thePLO news agency Wafa.   Small groups of Israeli activists from the Peace Now movement andYesh Gvul, which represents soldiers refusing to serve in theterritories, held silent vigils outside the Defense Ministry in TelAviv and government offices in Jerusalem.   ``Daddy, what do you do in the occupied territories?'' theirposters read.   An army spokeswoman said 18-year-old Mohammed Dahaise of GazaCity, was killed ``after he was identified as an inciter'' of astone-throwing attack on soldiers in the nearby Shati refugee camp.   The spokeswoman said Dahaise died on the spot. Arab hospitalofficials said he was shot in the head.   Israel has controlled the territories since the 1967 Middle EastWar, when it captured Gaza from Egypt and the West Bank from Jordan.The occupied lands are home to 1.7 million Palestinians.   In the West Bank village of Arraba, 10 Palestinians sufferedgunshot wounds Thursday in a clash set off by a demonstrationagainst an alleged Israeli collaborator, Arab reports said.   Arab witnesses said Arraba villagers stoned the home of aPalestinian suspected of collaborating and that he emerged with apistol, wounding four of the stone-throwers.   Israeli troops arrived and opened fire, wounding six morevillagers, the witnesses said.   Arab reporters said three villagers were wounded in a laterconfrontation in the area, prompting the army to impose a curfew andconfine the village's 5,000 residents to their homes.   Another army spokesman generally confirmed the account but wouldsay only that several villagers were wounded.   Arab reports said 25 other Palestinians were wounded in clashesin the occupied lands Thursday. But the army spokeman confirmedeight injuries from other clashes in the occupied territories andsaid it was checking the other reports.   Meanwhile, a new group called the Palestinian Popular Army issueda leaflet urging more attacks on the Israeli army and the more than70,000 Jewish settlers who have built enclaves in the territories.   The group said it was allied with the uprising's undergroundleaders who generally support the Palestine Liberation Organization.   In another development, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabinunveiled what he called ``a personal program'' for a peacesettlement in the occupied lands, Israel radio reported Thursday.   It said Rabin proposed a three-to-six month halt in the uprisingfollowed by elections to choose Palestinian representatives ``whoagree to negotiate a peace solution.''   He said the territories should be placed in a federation withJordan or Israel, the radio reported.   The defense minister was also quoted as saying that Jewishsettlements in the occupied territories would not be uprooted andresponsibility for security will remain in the hands of the Israeliarmy.</TEXT></DOC>
