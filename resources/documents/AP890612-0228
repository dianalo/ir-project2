(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A young eagle carrying a 5-ouncetransmitter is helping develop techniques to track ships, stolencars or even prison inmates.   ``We want to show that it can be done, that we can tracksomething the size of an eagle and for a reasonable cost,'' saidCarey Roberts, a researcher at the University of Tennessee SpaceInstitute. The transmitter costs $3,500, and time on a Frenchweather satellite is about $500 a month.   The two-year project, using a French weather satellite, is ajoint venture of the university and the Tennessee Wildlife ResourcesAgency, which hopes to learn more about the travel patterns of baldeagles.   The 1-year-old eagle, a male named Phoenix, was released atReelfoot Lake near Tiptonville, on May 31. It is the first ofseveral eagles, perhaps as many as 12, expected to eventually takepart in the project, said Bob Hatcher, endangered speciescoordinator for the TWRA.   The solar-powered transmitter strapped to the eagle's back willsend signals twice a day to a commercial satellite called Argos,which will relay the signals to a ground station in France, whichwill relay them to a station in Maryland. From there, theinformation can be picked up by the University of Tennessee'sresearchers using desktop computers.   The first signals are expected in Tullahoma within a week or so,Roberts said. Many of the signals may miss the satellite, dependingon its position, but impulses will be picked up about once a day.   The project could show that satellite tracking can be used tokeep up with freight trains, transport ships and even cars, shesaid. A number of states use electronic tracking devices to keep upwith parolees, but the range of that equipment is limited.   ``With these, anywhere they went in the world, we could findthem,'' Roberts said.</TEXT><HEAD>Research Throws New Light On Volcanic Eruptions</HEAD><DATELINE>ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Violent volcanic eruptions may be causedby sealed vents rather than by zones of water and volatile gases inmagma as previously thought, say scientists who studied California's600-year-old Obsidian Dome.   ``This changes the way we think about magma chambers and suggestsmagmas may be more uniformly gas rich and not as zoned as we thoughtbefore,'' said geologist John C. Eichelberger of Sandia NationalLaboratories.   Violent eruptions have been explained by the influence of watervapor and volatile gases in the upper zone of a magma chamber, deepbeneath the Earth's surface. The theory says trapped gases expand asmagma is forced into lower-pressure regions near the surface,causing explosions.   The violent eruption creates a funnel-shaped opening whichcollects debris, filling the vent through which subsequent magmamust pass. The porous rubble is like a sand pile, keeping pressureon the magma but letting gas leak out before drier magma reaches thesurface, where its lower pressure results in a flow.   Sandia's study suggests magma acts as a sponge that can leak gasas it rises to the surface. Fractured rock in the volcanic ventallows gas to escape from the magma, releasing pressure and causingless violent eruptions.   The Obsidian Dome volcano contains a magma tube within a broadervent. The vent contains debris from the initial explosive eruptionand the dome was built of lava that flowed over several weeks.Chemical studies showed the same magma caused the explosion and thedome-building, and that the material that built the dome lost mostof its gas before reaching the surface.   Magma that is 65 percent to 75 percent silica has silica-richmolecules which tend to chain together and drastically increase theresistance to flow, or viscosity. Silica-rich magma can be up to100,000 times more viscous _ thicker _ than basalt magma that are 40percent to 50 percent silica.   Because silica-rich magma is thicker, bubbles can't rise out ofit and escape, and gas remains trapped. Charles R. Carrigan ofSandia said if bubbles can't escape, magma with as little as 3percent gas will expand several hundred times when it reaches thesurface, resulting in an explosion.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for June 15</NOTE></DOC>
