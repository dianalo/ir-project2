The department's Economic Research Service said that nationallynet farm income could rise more than 10 percent this year to between$48 billion and $53 billion, $1 billion more than forecast in July.Last year's net income was around $44 billion, and the record was$47 billion in 1987.   As used by the agency, net farm income includes the value ofagricultural production whether sold or stored on the farm, andallowances for family dwellings and other adjustments, minus totaloperating expenses.   In another method of accounting, the report said this year's netcash income ``could fall from last year's record $60 billion.'' Netcash income does not include changes in inventory values and issimply gross cash income during the year minus cash operatingexpenses.   Economists said cash receipts from the sale of crops andlivestock are expected to rise $2 billion to $10 billion this year,more than offsetting a decline in direct government payments tofarmers. Total expenses are likely to go up 3 percent to 6 percent,largely because of more land being brought into crop production.   ``Wheat and corn receipts are expected to rise as much as 15percent this year, following sizeable gains last year'' the reportsaid. ``Vegetable receipts are also expected to rise. Soybeans,however, probably will see falling receipts as higher domesticproduction and record foreign output lead to a 25 percent decreasein prices.''   Total livestock and poultry receipts should see a modest rise,but hogs could be the only livestock group facing a drop, the reportsaid. Although the decline in 1989 hog receipts is expected to besmall _ less than $500 million _ it will be on top of a $1 billionreduction in 1988.</TEXT></DOC>
