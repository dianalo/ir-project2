The latest rise in the consumer price index, which followed 0.4% increases in each of the previous three months, equals 4% as a compounded annual rate, compared with a 5.5% annual rate in April. An acceleration in food costs last month was offset by smaller increases for energy, transportation and apparel.    Earlier this month, the department said its producer price index rose a modest 0.3% in May; a 0.7% spurt in those prices in April had fueled concern about inflation.    Separately, the Commerce Department said that a plunge in military bookings caused a 0.1% drop in durable goods orders in May. Excluding defense, however, orders were up a brisk 1.4%, and several economists suggested that manufacturers are benefiting from export gains.    The overall rise in orders last month followed a revised 0.7% increase in April. Previously, the department said orders were unchanged in April.    &quot;The numbers indicate that for now no spurt of inflation is likely,&quot; said Samuel Kahan, chief financial economist at Kleinwort Benson Government Securities Inc. in Chicago, commenting on the consumer price report. &quot;Those who were worried about inflation rearing its head can breathe a sigh of relief.&quot;    Charles Lieberman, senior vice president at Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp. in New York, said the figures suggest that the bulk of the spurt in oil and commodity prices earlier this year has now passed through the index. He predicted that coming monthly changes in energy prices would be modest and that food prices would &quot;settle down.&quot;    Energy prices increased 0.2% last month after a 0.3% rise in April and a 1% jump in March. Food prices were up 0.6% after a 0.3% increase in April and a 0.1% decline in March.    The Labor Department said gasoline prices rose 0.4% last month after a 0.7% increase in April; fuel oil prices had fallen 1.4% in May after rising 2.9% in April. Food prices were up 0.6% as big increases in beef and pork prices helped offset a drop in poultry prices.    Excluding food and energy costs, which sometimes vary widely from month to month, consumer prices rose 0.3% in May after a 0.5% April increase. Apparel costs, which had surged 1.5% in April and 1.7% in March, rose a modest 0.2% last month. The Labor Department said the slowdown reflected widespread sales promotions, particularly for women's and girls' clothing.    The recent spurt in clothing costs, which are sensitive to import prices, had raised fears that the decline of the dollar in foreign-exchange trading was leading to significant price rises in the U.S. Donald Ratajczak, director of the economic forecasting project at Georgia State University, said the latest report showed little effect from the dollar's drop, however.    He said the slowdown in apparel price increases, as well as smaller increases for cars and some household items, suggests that &quot;while producers are wanting to raise prices, consumers are very reluctant to accept increases. It's tough to get prices to stick.&quot;    The figures in both reports are adjusted for seasonal variation. Before adjustment, the consumer price index rose 0.3% in May to 338.7% of its 1967 average and stood 3.8% above a year earlier.    Beginning with the January report, the department has revised the index to reflect new consumer spending patterns and population shifts, among other things. For comparison purposes, the department said the old index rose 0.4% in May.    The index for urban wage earners and clerical workers, a measure that includes half the number of people covered by the broader index and is used in adjusting Social Security and retirement benefits, increased 0.4% in May after a 0.5% rise in April. Before adjustment, this index was up 0.3% to 333.4% of its 1967 average and was 3.7% above May 1986.    The Labor Department also said the average weekly earnings of U.S. workers rose 0.4% in May after adjustment for inflation and seasonal factors. These earnings fell a revised 0.8% in April. Previously, the department said earnings fell 1% in April.    The latest figure reflected a 0.4% rise in average hourly earnings and a 0.3% increase in hours worked.    Weekly earnings of U.S. workers averaged $311.46 after adjustment for seasonal factors but not for inflation, up from $309.18 in April. Before seasonal adjustment, average weekly earnings increased to $310.42 from $307.94.    The report on durable goods orders suggested that a modest pick-up for manufacturers is continuing after a long slump. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige said in a statement that orders excluding defense &quot;have strengthened appreciably this year, following three years of flat performance. The improving trend should continue with a boost from the rebound in our trade balance.&quot;    The report showed a sharp 5.8% rise last month in orders for non-defense capital goods, which are considered a barometer of business investment. These orders rose 3.3% in April. &quot;People are starting to invest as sales abroad are picking up,&quot; said Mr. Ratajczak.    Several economists cautioned, however, that much of the strength reflected civilian aircraft orders, which tend to be volatile. Mr. Lieberman said, &quot;It's a decent report but not one that indicates strength.&quot;    Defense orders fell 13.1% in May following a 10.2% April rise. Orders for transportation equipment increased 4.9% after a 7.4% drop. Primary metals were up 0.1% after a 5.6% rise. Electrical machinery fell 5.9% after a 19.6% gain. Nonelectrical machinery declined 0.4% after rising 2.6%.    The May drop brought durable goods orders to $106.85 billion from $106.93 billion in April. Shipments fell less than 0.1% to $102.66 billion after falling 1.9% to $102.71 billion. The backlog of unfilled orders rose 1.2% to $367.17 billion after a 1.2% rise in April to $362.99 billion.    Here are the seasonally adjusted changes in the components of the Labor Department's consumer price index for May.                                        % change from                                   April            May                                  1987             1986    All items ..................... 0.3              3.8    Food and beverage ............. 0.6              4.7    Housing ....................... 0.2              2.9    Apparel ....................... 0.2              5.6    Transportation ................ 0.3              2.9    Medical care .................. 0.6              6.8    Entertainment ................. 0.3              3.3    Other ......................... 0.6              5.8   May consumer price indexes for various metropolitan areas(1967 equals 100), together with the percentage increasesfrom May 1986, were:    U.S. City Average ........... 338.7              3.8    Chicago ..................... 338.4              4.4    Los Angeles ................. 345.1              4.8    New York .................... 339.0              5.7    Philadelphia ................ 336.2              5.4    San Francisco ............... 353.5              n.a.
