The Washington Post reported in its Sunday editions that FawnHall told a Drug Enforcement Administration agent of her cocaineuse during the agency's investigation of drug use and sales atnightclubs in Georgetown, an exclusive area of the city.

The former White House aide revealed her drug use to DEA agentsduring an interview in the Washington office of her attorney, PlatoCacheris, on Aug. 7, 1987, just two months after her Iran-Contratestimony, the sources told the newspaper.   ``I am not confirming any part of the story,'' said Cacheris,reached at his home Saturday night.   Hall is not a target of the DEA probe but said she is apotential grand jury witness in the ongoing investigation, the Postreported.   There were no allegations Hall sold drugs or ever used them atthe White House, according to the sources.   Hall now lives in California where she is pursuing an actingcarrer, the Post said.   Hall's close friends were surprised to learn of her acknowledgeddrug use.   ``I consider myself her best friend and I can't believe this,''Katy Dickey, who works at a Washington public relations firm, toldthe Post.
