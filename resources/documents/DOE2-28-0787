Properties are stronglyrelated to gamma precipitate size evolution and to a less extent by interstitialsolute entrainement. Fine gamma precipitation representative of lifetimeenvisaged (2 x 10/sup 5/ hours at 525/sup 0/C) localizes deformationand increases creep embrittlement. Aged materials defined by large sizeprecipitates allowing an homogeneous deformation is ideal for the utilizationenvisaged.</TEXT></DOC>
