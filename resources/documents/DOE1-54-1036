<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-54-1036 </DOCNO><TEXT>Excitation functions have been measured for different charge productsof the /sup 28/Si+/sup 48/Ti reaction in the laboratory energy range120--127 MeV in 250-keV steps at {theta}/sub lab/ = 28{sup 0}, 32{sup0}, and 40{sup 0}. Coherence energies of dissipative cross sections havebeen evaluated by statistical fluctuation analysis. The role of the angulardependence of the coherence energy in determining the interaction timeis discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
