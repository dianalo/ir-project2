(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Bush and Soviet LeaderMikhail S. Gorbachev will hold their first summit meeting nextyear, officials announced Saturday as the two superpowers completeda half-dozen accords and cleared a major roadblock to a treaty onslashing long-range nuclear weapons.   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, who spent theweekend in talks with Secretary of State James A. Baker III, saidthe summit would be held in ``spring or early summer.'' Heannounced a key concession from Moscow to move ahead toward along-range weapons agreement despite its objections to the U.S.Star Wars program.   First official word of the summit plans came from Bush, whoinformed reporters on a golf course near his vacation home in Maineafter taking a telephone call from Baker. ``I think around theworld people will be pleased,'' he said. Bush expressed pleasurewith the outcome of the weekend talks and said he would meetGorbachev in the United States, possibly in Washington.   Later, in a written statement, Bush said: ``I envision a broaddiscussion of the full agenda that the two sides have established _human rights, bilateral relations, arms control, regional issuesand transnational issues,''   Bush spoke more than a thousand miles from the snow-capped RockyMountain resort where Shevardnadze and Baker _ obviously pleasedwith their diplomacy _ reached agreement on a chemical weaponsaccord and several other points.   The agreements include:   _ Exchange of data on chemical weapons by the end of the yearand visits by inspectors of the other side to stockpiles and plantsby June 30. In a second phase, there would be more intensiveon-site inspections of the submitted data.   _ An ``umbrella agreement'' in principle that there should beverification of missile plants and information exchanged evenbefore a treaty to slash long-range nuclear weapons is completed.   _ Advance notification to the other side of exercises withlong-range bombers and other strategic weapons.   _ A ceiling of 10 on launchers carrying mobile intercontinentalballistic missiles at any one base. Some of the launchers would beexposed for monitoring.   _ Cooperating to enhance the power of the International Court ofJustice to settle disputes.   _ Two agreements to facilitate movement across the BeringStraits of Eskimos in Alaska and Eskimos in Siberia for visits.   _ Agreement on interpreting international rules for shipmovements.   Baker later told reporters that the two sides ``took a series ofsteps across the full arms control agenda to overcome oldmisconceptions and build trust.''   In one of a pair of conciliatory gestures, Shevardnadze said theSoviets would dismantle their Krasnoyarsk radar facility. TheUnited States has charged the Siberian radar was intended to bepart of a space-based defense outlawed in a 1972 treaty.   The Soviet foreign minister insisted, however, the United Statesshould ``remove our concerns'' about U.S. radar stationed inGreenland and Britain.   Baker said later he would be surprised if the Soviets weredemanding that the U.S. facilities be dismantled.   Baker said Shevardnadze wanted to send Soviet inspectors to thesites to make sure the radar is legal under the 1972 treaty.   In fact, Baker said, the installations are ``totally legal'' andany action on them required the approval of Denmark and Britain.   The Soviets also removed another key impediment to a strategicarms agreement, dropping their demand the pact include limits onsubmarine-launched cruise missiles, Shevardnadze and Baker said inback-to-back news conferences.   During the talks, the Soviets said a deal to limitnuclear-tipped SLCMs can be reached in a separate, simultaneousagreement, Shevardnadze and his aides said.   But the United States remains skeptical that means can be foundto monitor nuclear SLCMs, said Baker. And senior U.S. arms controlaides predicted the Soviets might not insist on completing the SLCMagreement before signing the more sweeping strategic arms accord.   Shevardnadze also told reporters that Moscow was making a majorconcession in arms control negotiations, announcing that hisgovernment would not let its objections to the U.S. Star Warsprogram block completion of a treaty to cut long range nuclearsubmarines, missiles and bombers by 30 to 50 percent.   ``The preparation and signing of a treaty now appears to bequite in reach,'' he said.   Baker hailed the move but stressed ``there are some difficultissues that still remain.'' He cited keeping track of cruisemissiles aboard airplanes, submarines and combat surface ships.   ``We have moved from confrontation to dialogue and now tocooperation,'' he said of the evolving superpower relationship.   The long-range weapons talks in Geneva have been deadlocked overthe Soviet demand that the treaty depend on completion of aseparate agreement on space-based defense. Since the United Statesdeclined to give ground on the search for a Star Wars defense inspace against Soviet ballistic missiles, that made an armsreduction accord improbable.   Baker acknowledged the Soviet concession on Star Wars, stressedBush's commitment to proceeding with the U.S. space-based defenseprogram and said he had offered the Soviets the opportunity tovisit research facilities associated with the program.   Baker also said the Bush administration's willingness to lift aban on mobile ICBM's ``made it possible for us to move ahead ondeveloping verification measures for mobile missiles.''   Shevardnadze said, ``This agreement (for a summit) reflects theconfidence of both sides that they will be able to reach importantmutually acceptable agreements and generally to achieve substantialprogress in relations between our two countries. And here I amreferring above all to the sphere of disarmament and security.''   The two-stage chemical weapons agreement provides for anexchange of data by the end of the year and inspection of U.S. andSoviet stockpiles and plants beginning next June 30.   More detailed inspections would be held later, if the 40 nationsmeeting in Geneva are within reach of an international treaty toban the deadly weapons.   Additional last-minute work remained to be done on anotheragreement for inspection of U.S. and Soviet underground nuclearweapons test. Baker said he hoped it could be completed before thewindup of his talks with his Soviet counterpart.   After a fishing expedition on Sunday morning, Baker andShevardnadze head for New York for the opening of the UnitedNations General Assembly on Monday.   Their work on the ground was also far-reaching. The chemicalweapons accord will open U.S. and Soviet arsenals and plants tocross-inspection and the two sides will exchange data on the deadlyweapon.   Apart from the formal agreements, Baker invited a group ofSoviet experts to visit Los Alamos National Laboratory and the TRWCorp.'s test facility in San Juan Capistrano to learn more aboutU.S. research on space defenses.   An announcement said the Soviets also would visit a particlebeam project at Los Alamos and observe a laser project at the TRWtest plant.   ``The U.S. believes that such visits would be usefulconfidence-building measures and would reduce the risk oftechnological surprise,'' the announcement said.   But, it added:``Our invitation ... is not preconditioned on areciprocal invitation by the Soviets.''</TEXT></DOC>
