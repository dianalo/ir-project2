(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An insurance executive authoritiesthought faked his death to avoid prosecution and collect $4 millionin insurance benefits was killed in a plane crash two years ago, anautopsy confirmed.   A state medical examiner said dental records Sunday proved thebody recovered from Lake Martin on Friday was that of 47-year-oldBlan Stewart of Huntsville, who disappeared while flying a smallplane in 1988.   Prosecutors had contended the insurance executive faked hisdeath to collect some $4 million and to avoid prosecution oncharges of stealing about $590,000 from clients.   Insurance companies had posted a $100,000 reward for informationon whether he was dead or alive.   The plane and Stewart's body were found under 65 feet of waterduring a private search arranged by his widow, Sarah ``Robin''Stewart.   He died of drowning and injuries suffered when the plane slammedinto the lake, said the medical examiner, who spoke on condition ofanonymity.   ``I assume we'll close the book on the case,'' said LarryChilders, spokesman for the state attorney general's office.   Once a death certificate is issued, Mrs. Stewart can start theprocess of collecting the insurance money, said John Heacock, herattorney.   A judge in May had refused Mrs. Stewart's attempt to have herhusband declared dead. The judge heard testimony from a man whoclaimed to have seen the plane flying low after air trafficcontrollers lost contact with Stewart.   The attorney general's office had said at least two peopleclaimed to have seen Stewart in the Virgin Islands and SouthCarolina long after he disappeared.   ``I have to assume, like most do, that people make mistakes,''said Childers.</TEXT></DOC>
