Dan Rather featured it on the evening news,&quot; says Stephen Brobeck, executive director of CFA, a coalition of more than 200 organizations. Looking back, Mr. Brobeck says that study &quot;was the big event&quot; that launched the publicity-driven strategy that's regaining consumer groups some clout on Capitol Hill.    They chose their target: consumer banking. And after years on the defensive in the wake of deregulation and the pro-business Reagan administration, consumer groups are finding the tide is turning more in their favor. For a change, consumer lobbyists are on the offensive and to a large extent are helping to set the agenda for consumer banking legislation.    Their successes are far more limited than in the consumer-protection heydays of the 1970s. But gains in the financial services field show at least one area where certain consumer groups are gaining ground again after years of fighting simply to hold the line.    Already this session, Congress has enacted provisions sought by consumer groups to slap caps on adjustable-rate mortgages and speed up bank customers' access to funds deposited by check. Last year, they won nothing. Other pet legislation of consumer groups is getting lawmakers' attention, too.    And the groups already have set their sights on their next target for congressional action: insurance.    Some of their success this year, of course, is because of lucky circumstances. First, Democrats took control of the Senate, where consumer banking bills had often died of inaction in Republican hands. Second, for the first time in five years, a major banking industry bill passed through Congress, providing a vehicle on which to hitch some pro-consumer provisions.    But besides luck, there was also a strategy. In 1982, some consumer groups decided to zero in on banking because they anticipated that problems would spring out of deregulation in the banking industry. Over time, they expanded from one to as many as five the number of lobbyists working on consumer banking issues. Besides CFA, major players on banking bills are the Consumers Union, Public Citizen's Congress Watch and the U.S. Public Interest Research Group. Other groups like the American Association of Retired Persons, Bankcard Holders of America and the National Consumer Law Center also join in.    The 1982 interest-rate study that made the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; exemplifies the strategy still followed today: Research problems, let news organizations publicize the findings and then slip legislative proposals to congressmen whose constituents are grumbling about what they've just read in the headlines or seen on the TV news. &quot;Clearly our strength is more through the media than grass roots,&quot; says Alan Fox, CFA's banking lobbyist.    Consumer groups also have adopted some of the lobbying tactics of their powerful and well-financed counterparts in the financial industry. Especially in the House, consumer lobbyists are gaining important behind-the-scenes influence on banking legislation. They boast that they wrote many of the provisions currently getting attention, and, indeed, sometimes they know more about a bill's fine details than the lawmaker or his staff.    &quot;There's nothing unusual or unethical about it,&quot; says Philip Corwin, a legislative strategist for the American Bankers Association, a major banking trade group often on opposite sides of issues from consumer groups. He says it's common practice for lobbyists to give receptive lawmakers either ideas or actual drafts of legislation that the special-interest groups want passed.    But the banking industry contends consumer groups sometimes create issues where none exist and unfairly limit choices for consumers. &quot;Sometimes they push measures that on the face of it are good for the consumer, when in fact they end up not being so good,&quot; says Ken Guenther, executive vice president of the Independent Bankers Association of America. And when consumer groups targeted home-equity loans for reform, bankers uniformly griped that the problems the groups cited were only hypothetical.    Part of the consumer groups' success is also that they've learned when to compromise to get bills passed, says Democratic Rep. Charles Schumer of New York, a self-described &quot;lead spear-carrier&quot; for consumer groups on the House Banking Committee.    His assessment, while true on some issues, includes a bit of wishful thinking when it comes to his own credit-card bill. In a rare disagreement with Mr. Schumer, the consumer groups are backing a move to amend his bill, when it goes to the House floor soon, to add a cap on credit-card interest rates. Mr. Schumer currently opposes a cap, after earlier supporting one; instead, he supports better disclosure of credit-card rates and fees.    There are numerous examples of how closely consumer lobbyists collaborate with sympathetic lawmakers or their staffs to draw up and push legislation, landing many of the consumer groups' ideas on the legislative plate. Says CFA's Mr. Fox: &quot;Essentially, we operate as an extension of congressmen's staffs. Occasionally we come up with the legislation, or speeches -- and questions (for lawmakers to ask at hearings) all the time. We look at it as providing staff work for allies.&quot;    The cap on adjustable-rate mortgages, including home-equity loans, that was enacted this year was added to a banking bill on the Senate floor by Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D., Ohio). It was on a list of eight ideas consumer lobbyists had given him. &quot;Metzenbaum's modus operandi,&quot; says Michelle Meier, a Consumers Union lobbyist, &quot;is (for his staff) to call us up and say, 'The bill is moving forward. What would you like us to do?' We know it can't be a major thing, but something nice and sweet we would like to see.&quot; Ms. Meier says she wrote the amendment, and indeed, Mr. Metzenbaum's office referred a caller with detailed questions on the provision to Ms. Meier.    The old publicity-raising strategy was pressed into service this year, too, to draw attention to home-equity loans and a truth-in-savings bill requiring fuller disclosure on banking accounts. Since a widely covered CFA-Consumers Union news conference on home-equity loans, Rep. David Price (D., N.C.) has introduced a bill and Mr. Schumer is preparing one. The truth-in-savings bill got an extra push when CFA's annual banking survey revealed that some banks aren't paying interest on as much as 12% of deposits in NOW and Super NOW accounts.    Different coalitions of consumer groups are trying to focus on what they would like Congress to do about insurance. Some groups already are pushing for repeal of the insurance industry's exemption from antitrust laws.    ---            Major Consumer Banking Legislation 1987   Check Holds -- Limits how long banks may delay access tofunds deposited by check.
