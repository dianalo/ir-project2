Jesse Jackson openly sought the nomination widely expected togo elsewhere, saying ``If it was offered to me I would accept it.''   Vice President George Bush said he might consider Bob Dole oranother former Republican rival as his partner when he picks arunning mate next month.   Dukakis met with Paul Brountas and then sent his longtimeconfidant to Washington to meet with Jackson, runner-up in theprimaries and widely regarded as unlikely to receive an offer tojoin the ticket.   Jackson, one of seven known candidates for the vice presidentialnomination, termed the session ``an oral interview and@or exam'' onthe topic. He said he gave Brountas his ``candid view as to theoffice of vice president ... and what I thought my qualificationsmight be.''   He said it was ``self-evident'' he would like to be vicepresident.   But more likely candidates were Sens. Bob Graham of Florida,Lloyd Bentsen of Texas; John Glenn of Ohio; Albert Gore Jr. ofTennessee and Reps. Richard Gephardt of Missouri and Lee Hamiltonof Indiana.   The increasingly delicate maneuvering came as a CBS News-NewYork Times poll found the Massachusetts governor holding a 47percent to 39 percent lead over Bush in a nationwide surveyconducted last week.   Democratic chairman Paul Kirk preached the gospel of party unityat a news conference in Atlanta one week before the partynominating convention opens. He said any disagreements over theparty's bare-bones platform ``are gradually being worked out''between the Dukakis and Jackson forces.   ``I don't expect there will be any so-called floor fights overthe platform,'' he said.   Jackson adviser Ron Brown wasn't ready to go that far, althoughhe said the two sides are continuing to negotiate in an attempt towork out remaining differences. ``There might be some very seriousissues of principle that go to the floor of the convention,'' hesaid in Atlanta. Jackson supports calls for higher taxes on thewealthy and a five-year freeze in military spending; Dukakisopposes both.   The convention hall itself was a hardhat zone. The televisionnetwork skyboxes were in place, but painters, carpenters andelectricians all worked to ready the Omni for the invasion ofDemocrats, reporters and political junkies that will fill everyavailable inch of space.   Dukakis stayed mum on the subject on every Democrat's mind _ hischoice of a political partner for the fall campaign. ``Have a goodevening,'' was all he said to reporters as he left his statehouseoffice at the end of the day.   But the signs pointed to a decision soon, and the calendardictated one. An announcement was expected this week, at least inpart to allow Dukakis and Jackson supporters time to absorb thedecision before their arrival in Atlanta.   The governor spent part of the day at his statehouse officeworking on a Massachusetts budget crunch, and the balance of theday at home. His aides said Dukakis was mulling his choices. He metduring the morning with Brountas, and the two had a second,late-night session after Brountas returned from Washington.Afterward, Brountas refused to say whether a running mate had beenpicked.   ``He hasn't made up his mind yet,'' said one Dukakis aide,speaking on condition he not be identified by name. ``Or if he has,he hasn't told anybody.''   Brountas flew to Washington to meet with Jackson, regarded astoo liberal and too controversial to get Dukakis' nod.   He joked about the subject at one point, saying, ``So far,Dukakis has not accepted my offer and I have not refused his.''   But later, Jackson turned serious.   ``If I am not on the team, then the governor must determine whothe team members are and what role they will play,'' Jackson saidbefore the session began.   He added, ``Certainly I am convinced that we have the challengeand the obligation to work together to win for the fall. But beyondthat we must establish a partnership of equity and sharedresponsibility.''   Bush took a jab at Dukakis in a speech to farm editors andbroadcasters that he billed as non-partisan. ``I am not the one whofeels that the problems of agricultural America can be solved byplanting more Belgian endive,'' he said, poking fun at an off-handcomment Dukakis made in Iowa last year.   Bush, who is waiting for Dukakis to pick a running mate beforehe does, offered praise of one-time primary foe Bob Dole and saidhe doesn't rule out any of the men who ran against him for theRepublican nomination.   ``The fact that you ran against somebody certainly in my viewwould not preclude consideration of that person,'' the vicepresident told a meeting of agricultural editors, writers andbroadcasters in Washington.   ``I will say this about Bob Dole _ he and I went head on head.So did Pat Robertson and Al Haig and Pete du Pont and Jack Kemp.... My party has never been more unified going into a Republicanconvention than we are right now, thanks to the way Bob Dole andthe others have been conducting themselves and their sense ofadvocacy.''   The vice president said he would solicit advice from a varietyof Republican lawmakers and GOP National Committee members, andthen ``make a very personal decision.''   But, he said, ``I just don't want to start going through longlists or short lists because believe me, at this juncture, we don'thave them.''   Dukakis' eight-point lead in the CBS-New York Times pollrepresented a small drop from a 10-point edge in a similar surveyin May. In addition, 28 percent of those polled expressed afavorable view of Dukakis, down from 38 percent in May. Twenty-onepercent expressed an unfavorable view, up from 14 percent.   Bush's favorable rating was 26 percent, down from 33 percent,and his unfavorable rating was 31 percent, about the same as its 35percent in May.</TEXT></DOC>
