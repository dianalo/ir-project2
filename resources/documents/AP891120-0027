(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A quaint brass plate above the front door ofJim Holman's century-old home in this historic town hints that hisattitude isn't quite in step with preservationists: ``On This Sitein 1897, Nothing Happened.''   The sentiment is Holman's way of thumbing his nose at his town'slove affair with the past and with the tourists who swarm to the``Most Picturesque Community in the Midwest.''   Galena, whose regular population of 3,800 sometimes triples withweekend visitors, has spent years sticking with its careful zoninglaws and strict adherence to federal historic preservationguidelines.   But Holman and some fellow residents are fed up with having tomaintain what they fear is becoming a living museum of antiquatedsmall-town life.   ``We feel confined,'' Holman said recently at a gathering in hishome with several members of the newly formed Citizens AgainstExcessive Zoning.   ``We're not at ease even in our own homes. We feel like theconcerns of lifelong and long-term Galenans take a backseat toweekend Galenans.''   City officials, including zoning administrator Rik Fjelde, havea different view.   ``If you own a house in the historic district, you have acertain obligation to maintain it, and that's the preference of themajority of citizens or it wouldn't be that way,'' Fjelde said.   Almost every resident of Galena lives in the historic district,whose pleasing orderliness, tucked perfectly into the hills nearthe northwest corner of the state, recalls a Currier and Ives print.   Mayor Terry Cole, elected in May, has made it a priority toenforce zoning and preservation ordinances. For property owners,that means only Federalist-style doors on Federalist-style houses.   The attention to historical detail can be expensive. A fewmonths ago, Holman bought $200 worth of wooden railroad ties tocomplete a fence around his yard. No sooner had he gotten it upthan Fjelde told him he would have to take it down and replace theties with more historically correct stone.   ``The lowest bid I could get for stone to make a wall was$3,600,'' he said.   That's when Holman, who works in the maintenance department of achemical company in East Dubuque, wrote a letter to a newspaperseeking responses from others frustrated with the regulations.   Holman said he was deluged with calls, leading to his committee.The group has started petition drives aimed at securing electedrather than appointed members of the zoning-appeals board and thehistoric-district advisory board, as well as the removal of Fjelde.   City attorney John Cox, however, said both boards are advisoryand under Illinois statute, local voters can't make them electivebodies.   ``He's probably right,'' said Charlie Petitgout, vice chairmanof the committee and owner of an electrical shop. ``But the mainreason we did this was to get the city to pay attention to ourproblems.''</TEXT></DOC>
