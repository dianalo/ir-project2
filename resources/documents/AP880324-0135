The civil lawsuit is set for trial June 26. The 29 defendants inthe case include Richard V. Secord and Albert Hakim, twobusinessmen who have been charged with conpiracy and theft in theIran-Contra case.   Secord and Hakim, along with Oliver L. North and John M.Poindexter, were arraigned before Judge Gerhard Gesell Thursday inU.S. District Court.   During the proceedings, Secord's lawyer, Thomas Green, toldGesell about a potential conflict in scheduling between theIran-Contra case and the case in Miami's federal court.   ``It will not go forward,'' Gesell said. ``A criminal case takesprecedence. This case has got to take priority.''   Gesell said: ``I've cancelled every case I have and I'vecancelled my vacation.''   Secord and Hakim are accused of helping North and Poindexter,two former White House aides, secretly sell weapons to Iran anddivert the profits to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.   The Florida lawsuit was filed by Martha Honey and Tony Avirgan,two freelance reporters based in Costa Rica. They are representedby The Christic Institute, a liberal policy group.   The lawsuit accuses the defendants of drug-trafficking,gun-running and plotting assassinations. The defendants have deniedthe charges.</TEXT></DOC>
