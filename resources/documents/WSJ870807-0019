Three Bridges Investment Group, in its lawsuit, charges that the $33.65-a-share offer is inadequate.    Birmingham, Ala.-based Parisian sells clothing, shoes, cosmetics and accessories. Hooker, an Australian real estate developer, made the offer last month in partnership with a management group that already owns 54% of Parisian's stock.    Parisian said Hooker and the individual defendants had advised it that they believe the suit, filed in state court in Birmingham, is without merit. In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Parisian closed at $30.75 a share, unchanged.    In a leveraged buy-out, a small group of investors acquires a company largely with debt that ultimately is paid with funds generated by the acquired company. </TEXT></DOC>
