Sulfites may cause severe reactions in about 500,000 Americans, mostly asthmatics. About 1,100 drugs contain sulfites, which are used as preservatives.    Earlier this year, the FDA banned the use of sulfites as preservatives on raw fruits and vegetables. According to the agency, many of the serious reactions and most of the 14 deaths that may have been caused by sulfites were linked to restaurant foods, especially salads. Warning labels also are required when sulfites are used in packaged and processed foods. </TEXT></DOC>
