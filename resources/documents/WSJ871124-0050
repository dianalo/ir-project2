Oak Brook, Ill.-based Waste Management, the nation's largest waste hauler, said it entered the plea in U.S. district court in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., on behalf of Waste Management Inc. of Florida, doing business as United Sanitation Services. The company was charged in September with engaging in criminal antitrust activity in the Miami and Fort Lauderdale area between 1980 and 1985.    Federal Judge Jose A. Gonzales Jr. accepted the plea over the objections of federal antitrust prosecutors and set sentencing for Jan. 15. The antitrust charge carries a maximum fine of $1 million.    In a no contest plea, a defendant doesn't admit guilt but is convicted and punished as if he had pleaded guilty. The defendant has the right to deny the charge in other legal proceedings. United Sanitation Services still faces a civil antitrust suit filed last year by Florida authorities.    A Waste Management spokesman yesterday blamed the Florida antitrust activities on two former United Sanitation Services executives. He said the no contest plea &quot;will allow us to bring this matter to a conclusion.&quot;    The former executives, Lewis R. Goodman and David Hoopengardner, United Sanitation's chief operating officer and general manager, respectively, were convicted on antitrust charges by federal juries last year. Federal prosecutors had argued that Waste Management should also stand trial or plead guilty. Justice Department antitrust officials declined to comment on Judge Gonzales's decision to accept the no contest plea.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Waste Management closed at $35.25 a share, up 37.5 cents.    Waste Management is a subject of antitrust investigations by federal grand juries in California, Arizona, Tennessee and Orlando, Fla., according to people familiar with the investigations. A federal grand jury in Birmingham, Ala., is also investigating allegations involving a Waste Management affiliate. The company has disputed its role in several of those investigations. In October, Waste Management and Browning-Ferris Industries Inc., the second-largest waste hauler in the U.S., pleaded guilty to a federal criminal antitrust charge in Toledo, Ohio, and each agreed to pay a maximum $1 million fine. </TEXT></DOC>
