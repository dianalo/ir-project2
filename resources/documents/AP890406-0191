The letter _ signed by Democrats Edward M. Kennedy ofMassachusetts and Sam Nunn of Georgia as well as Republicans StromThurmond of South Carolina and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania _ wasdelivered to the Justice Department after Thornburgh had left forthe day, said aide Dave Runkel.   Recently, Thornburgh ``has said he was leaning in favor ofmerging those offices into the U.S. attorneys' offices,'' Runkelsaid. ``He said he felt that would enhance the federal effortsagainst organized crime.''   The U.S. attorneys around the country have recommended _unanimously, according to Runkel _ that the strike forces ``beassimilated into the U.S. attorneys' offices.'' The recommendationis under review by the Justice Department criminal division and isexpected to be forwarded to Thornburgh soon, Runkel said.   ``A lot of the organized crime business these days is, in fact,drugs, and when you fence the U.S. attorneys out of those cases,that doesn't seem to be the right thing to do,'' Runkel said. ``Itseems appropriate to merge them and have one federal prosecutorrather than two federal prosecutors in the same parts of thecountry.''   There are strike forces in about two dozen major cities aroundthe country.   Runkel noted that the strike force in New York was merged withthe U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan several years ago.   ``Under the past three U.S. attorneys, New York was the mostactive in the country in the fight against organized crime,'' hesaid.   The senators noted that Thornburgh has said in speeches and intestimony before Congress that ``some of the reasons giving rise tothe establishment of organized crime strike forces still apply,including the need for seasoned prosecutors who can commit the timenecessary to prepare these cases and who are free of daily criminaldocket obligations.''   The 1988 drug bill, they wrote, included a provision requiring acomprehensive reorganization study that should be completed inseveral months.   ``A decision as important as this would benefit from the resultsof that study,'' the letter said. ``Accordingly, we urge you todelay any such decision until the appropriate committees of theCongress have reasonable time to consider your proposal. We pledgeto do so expeditiously.''</TEXT></DOC>
