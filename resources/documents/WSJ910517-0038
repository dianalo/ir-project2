Crude oil for June delivery briefly broke through thepsychologically important level of $21 a barrel on the NewYork Mercantile Exchange yesterday before falling back. Itthen settled at $20.89 a barrel, down three cents for theday. The July crude contract ended nearly flat at $20.99 abarrel, down one cent.</LP><TEXT>   On London's International Petroleum Exchange, Brent blendcrude-oil futures closed mixed, ranging from 18 cents abarrel lower to 35 cents higher. There was pressure on theBrent blend, according to the Dow Jones InternationalPetroleum Report, because of the prospect of higher suppliesof North Sea oil in June after the completion of maintenanceand safety work on production facilities.   Also, in the U.S. futures market, crude oil slipped into&quot;contango&quot; -- in which later-maturing contracts are worthmore than the soonest-to-expire contracts. This is considereda bearish factor by some, although the difference between theJune and July crudes yesterday was only 10 cents a barrel.   Even so, some futures brokers cautioned againstexpectations of any significant erosion of crude prices atthis time. &quot;Basically, the market is consolidating,&quot; saidShahrokh Nikkhah, executive vice president of Refco Inc.,&quot;but any surprise should be to the upside. The market stillis in a long-term uptrend.&quot;   Crude oil held in storage by Saudi Arabia and Iran stillremains high, but Mr. Nikkhah and others said the two leadingOPEC members are showing restraint in depleting theirinventories. Also, crude oil prices usually rise just priorto an OPEC meeting.   OPEC's midyear conference doesn't begin until June 4 inVienna. But many -- possibly a majority -- of the 13 oilministers will get together earlier. They will participate ina three-day conference beginning May 27 in Isfahan, Iran.   &quot;Much will be resolved before they start the OPECmeeting,&quot; said Fereidun Fesharaki, resources program directorat Honolulu's East-West Center. In his latest price advisory,Mr. Fesharaki predicts that the price of West TexasIntermediate, the U.S. benchmark crude similar to that tradedon the New York Mercantile Exchange, will average $21 abarrel for May, rising to $21.50 a barrel for June beforedropping to $20 for July.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          GRAINS and SOYBEANS: Prices of soybean futures contractsrose slightly in the wake of a U.S. Senate vote in favor ofgranting $1.5 billion in export credit guarantees to theSoviet Union. Passage was widely expected. Prices of mostcorn futures contracts rose. Traders are growing increasinglyconcerned that continued wet weather in the Midwest isdelaying the corn planting season. There are reports thatfarmers in some areas have already decided to plantshorter-term varieties.                                                                                                          PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices fell. Gold for Junedelivery ended $3.80 an ounce lower at $357.10; July silverlost 9.5 cents an ounce to finish at $4.038. Middle Easternbuying of physical silver caused prices to rise on Wednesdayto as high as $4.18, but producer selling once again derailedthe rally and forced prices down, an analyst said. Producerselling was also behind the drop in gold prices yesterday,said George Parrill, chief trader at the Bank of Nova Scotia.Producers expect gold over the longer term will fall, so theyare taking advantage of rallies to sell, he said. He thinksgold could test the $350-an-ounce level again. Oversupplywill hinder silver's attempts at rallies, said Mr. Parrill,who predicts a trading range of $3.75 to $4.25 over the nextmonth.                                                                                                          SUGAR: July sugar ended unchanged at 7.89 cents a pound.C. Zarnikow, a big London trade house, yesterday revised itssupply-and-demand estimate for the current year to showproduction outpacing consumption. The result, noted JudithGanes, senior analyst at Merrill Lynch, is surplus stocksrising by 2.5 million tons. The Zarnikow estimate can beconfusing because it reports production estimates byindividual countries' crop years and consumption on acalendar year, she said. Translating it to an internationalcrop year ending in August 1991, she said, stocks could riseby at least 3.5 million tons, compared with a surplus of halfthat amount last year. Given good weather conditions, therecould be another production surplus in 1991-92, she added.But weather could become a concern in Eastern Europe, saidJim Roemer, meteorologist of Freese Notis Weather in DesMoines, Iowa. Wet conditions in March, frost in April, andcooler-than-normal temperatures in May could affect thedevelopment of the sugar beet crop, particularly if the coolspell continues, he said. Ms. Ganes said she hasn't heard ofany concerns about the crop, but noted that a sunny summercan easily make up for any growth retardation caused by acool spring. The bigger problems in Eastern Europe and theSoviet Union, she said, are poor equipment andtransportation.</TEXT></DOC>
