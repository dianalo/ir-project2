Spain's state holding company, National Institute of Industry,selected the Italian company's offer over a bid from Daimler-BenzAG of West Germany.   Fiat's Iveco agreed to pay 1.2 billion pesetas, or about $12million, in cash for the stake, according to the NationalInstitute's president, Jordi Mercader.   He said Iveco also agreed to spend another 12 billion pesetas,or $120 million, on buying new Enasa shares that will be offered inJanuary.   Iveco, Europe's second-largest truckmaker after Daimler, willhave a six-year option to purchase the remaining 40 percent ofEnasa shares that remain under the National Institute's control, hesaid.   Mercader told Spanish National Radio that the state holdingcompany had accepted Fiat's offer because it was superior to thatmade by Daimler.   Mercader did not elaborate on the latest Daimler offer.   ``This decision strengthens Enasa as it faces the tough times upthe road ahead,'' Mercader told national radio.   A key part of the sale agreement includes Iveco guarantees forall 5,700 current jobs at the company's three plants and Enasa'stop-line heavy truck brand name Pegaso.   Attempts by National Institute of Industry officials to salvagean earlier proposed sale to Daimler-Benz reportedly floundered onthe giant German truckmaker's insistence on more job cuts, statesubsidies and a plant closure.   In a statement released in New York, Fiat said it hoped to takesteps to enable Enasa to broaden its product range in both lightand heavy vehicle markets and to become more competitive.   ``This transaction is a further step in the internationalizationof Fiat Group after the recently-signed agreements with Fordvis-a-vis the farm equipment business and Nippondenso for the jointproduction of car air conditioners and heaters,'' Cesare Romiti,president and chief executive of Fiat Group and chairman of Iveco.   Last November, the Spanish government chose a joint bid byDaimler-Benz and Man AG of West Germany to buy an 80 percent stakein the Spanish company.   In doing so, it passed over other offers by Fiat's Iveco,Anglo-Dutch truckmaker DAF NV and AB Volvo of Sweden.   But the Daimler-Man joint takeover collapsed last July. Thegovernment subsequently sought to get Daimler to take a majoritystake alone or with another European partner or to entice Fiat tocome in.   Enasa reported sales of more than 11,000 light and heavy truckslast year and earned 240 million pesetas, or $2.47 million. It wasthe first time Enasa had posted an annual profit in years.   But analysts said the confusion this year over Enasa's futureowners and slowing demand for trucks has produced losses throughthe first six months of 6 billion pesetas, or $60 million.   The industrial vehicles division of Fiat preoduced 139,300vehicles last year. Iveco had operating income of about $486million on revenue of $6.4 billion in 1989.</TEXT></DOC>
