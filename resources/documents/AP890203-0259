Industry officials in several states report little local concernabout the ads, which the American Bankers Association says have runin Texas, Arkansas and Kansas.   ``Locally, that ad stirred up nothing whatsoever and was notintended to stir up anything,'' says Thomas R. Lee, president of theUnion State Bank in Clay Center, Kan.   White House Chief of Staff John Sununu criticized the ads as``irresponsible,'' according to an industry official who metprivately Thursday in Washington with Sununu, Bush and five thriftand bank trade associations.   On Jan. 24, Union State Bank of Clay Center, Kan., placed an adin the daily Clay Center Dispatch asking, ``Are you questioning howsecure your money is with all the stories being published about thethrift industry?'' The ad also detailed the bank's stability and thesecurity of deposits there.   Lee said in a telephone interview that he wanted to reassurepeople who had questions about the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.,which insures bank deposits up to $100,000.   ``When you're in a small, rural, conservative community, peopleare very conscious about the security of their money,'' he said.   The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., which insuresthrift deposits to $100,000, is insolvent because of soaring outlaysin recent years to compensate depositors in failed thrifts.   Depositors apparently ignored the Union State ad, Lee said. Noone in the north central Kansas town of about 5,000 mentioned it tobank officials, and many of the bank's 22 employees didn't even knowit ran, he said.   ``I'm not so sure they (Bush administration officials) haven'tcreated more excitement about it just by bringing it up. Locallyit's a dead issue,'' he said.   Chuck Stones, research director for the Kansas BankersAssociation, said he hadn't heard of any similar ads by the state's589 other banks.   The Washington-based ABA said it could not disclose the names ofbanks that ran the ads. The banking industry in past years has runits own ad campaigns aimed at differentiating itself from the thriftindustry in the eyes of consumers.   ``It is a very sensitive issue for bankers who have been undersiege for years now by some bankrupt savings and loans who aretrying to compete with below-market rates,'' said Mary-Liz Meany, anABA spokeswoman.   ``Credit unions are now claiming in their ads that they have thehealthiest insurance fund,'' she said. ``So bankers are extremelysensitive and they are likely to continue to be in this case.''   She said the association was soon going ``to communicate theconcerns expressed in Washington to these institutions'' running theads.   ``The gist of one of the ads was, `You sure have read a lot ofinformation in the press about thrifts, and if you have anyconcerns, you should definitely keep your money in a bank,''' saidMs. Meany.   FDIC spokesman Stephen Katsanos said the agency has no policy onthe ad tactics and wasn't aware of them before Thursday.   At least one Arkansas bank ran an ad recently contrasting thesecurity of its deposits with those in thrifts, according to stateindustry officials.   ``That was reported to me, but we have 255 banks in this state,''said Bo Carvill, executive director of the Arkansas State BankersAssociation. ``It did happen but I don't know anything more aboutit.''   One thrift official said he was not surprised by the ads.   ``Perhaps those banks feel comfortable in making thatdistinction, but many of the banks have not been all that healthy,''said Jerry Crenshaw, Sunbelt Savings marketing manager in Dallas.``Any funds institution has to be careful in today's environment intalking about another.''</TEXT></DOC>
