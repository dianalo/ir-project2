The heavily traveled New York commuter railway has been immobilized by a strike since Jan. 18. The walkout began after the expiration of an earlier cooling-off period, which was called after 10 of 15 of the railway's unions declined to ratify a proposed new contract.    The legislation, passed yesterday by voice votes in the House and Senate, would prohibit strikes or lockouts against the Long Island Rail Road for the 60 days ending March 17, while labor-management negotiations continue. The president must sign the measure before it can have the force of law.    Of the 15 unions, 10 have settled a contract or agreed to arbitration. The strike's impact on commuters in the past week has been made more difficult by recent snowstorms in the New York area. </TEXT></DOC>
