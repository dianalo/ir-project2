Kohl's popularity among West Germans has plunged in recentmonths, and the party's fortunes appear to be following him. The bigtest, the national elections that choose a federal chancellor, is inDecember 1990.   Some key political figures already have begun distancingthemselves from Kohl, whose image has been bruised by a chemicalweapons scandal, indecisiveness over NATO strategy and numerousdomestic troubles.   Not the least of his problems is a series of poor showings by hisChristian Democrats in regional elections, which some party regularsworry may be a harbinger of the national race.   The party lost its legislative majority in West Berlin on Jan.29, and public opinion polls conducted since indicate Kohl'sconservative party would lose to the left-leaning Social Democratsif national elections were held today.   On Sunday, the Christian Democrats lost control of the Frankfurtcity council and other important local legislatures in ballotingthroughout Hesse state.   The conservative Bonn daily Die Welt suggested Tuesday that theparty could use a ``fresh start'', with Baden-Wuerttemberg stategovernor Lothar Spaeth replacing Kohl.   ``Lothar Spaeth is certainly very suitable as chancellor,''Stuttgart Mayor Manfred Rommel, a prominent Christian Democrat, saidin an interview for today's edition of the Bild newspaper.   Such speculation is bad news for the Christian Democrats, wholack a clear majority in the federal parliament, controlling thegovernment through a delicate alliance with the liberal FreeDemocratic Party.   The Free Democrats also suffered in the Hesse elections, andparty leader Otto Lambsdorff hinted that the relationship withKohl's party was being re-evaluated.   ``We have no cause to stick our head between our knees,''Lambsdorff said Monday. ``We have considerable doubts about the waythe campaign in Frankfurt was conducted in the final days and weekswith regard to policies on foreigners, asylum-seekers andimmigrants.''   Right-wing extremists of the National Democratic Party won 6.6percent of the vote in elections to the Frankfurt city council,focusing on what the federal government should do to slow the influxof foreigners.   Likewise, the Christian Democrats' showing in the world arena hasnot generated many popularity points.   The leadership has taken a beating over its handling of U.S.charges that West German companies helped build a suspected chemicalweapons plant for Libya, and over its refusal to be pinned down onwhether it will support NATO plans to modernize short-range nuclearmissiles on West German soil.   The head of the Christian Democrats' Bavarian sister party, theChristian Social Union, described the outcome of Sunday's electionsas ``catastrophic,'' but resisted suggestions that a new candidatefor chancellor is needed.   ``The chancellor is elected, he is the party's national leader,and I don't know anyone who wants to relieve him,'' Christian SocialUnion leader Theodor Waigel told the ARD television network.   Meeting reporters Monday, Kohl alternately exuded confidence anddefensiveness as he downplayed the Hesse elections and his tumble inthe polls.   ``We have every chance to win the federal elections,'' Kohl said.   He blamed the Christian Democrats' poor showing in Hesse onunpopular but necessary social security and tax reforms.   Kohl conceded that the party finds itself ``in a very serioussituation'' and must consider major policy revisions during aconference planned in mid-April.   But the chancellor bristled at questions about whether he wouldbow out of the competition for the party's nomination forchancellor, claiming he had ``survived'' political setbacks beforeand faced the next campaign ``with great composure.''   Kohl noted that the fringe parties, the ultra-rightist NationalDemocratic Party and the far-left Greens party _ not the rivalSocial Democrats _ were the biggest beneficiaries of the ChristianDemocrats' losses.   However, the Social Democrats in West Berlin have entered into analliance with the far-left Alternative List group to gain control ofthe city-state's government in the wake of the Christian Democratlosses.   Some political observers say such an alliance could happennationally, creating a liberal block strong enough to oust theChristian Democrats.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Carol J.
