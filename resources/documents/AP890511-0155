The U.S. Office of Personnel Management says it is consideringpay scales that are more ``market sensitive.''   Private sector salaries rose 22.8 percent from 1984 to 1987while federal pay rates increased only 10.5 percent, according to areport from the Boston Federal Executive Board, which represents27,000 federal employees who earned an average $21,724 in 1987.   ``The significant pay disparity severely reduces thegovernment's ability to attract and retain good and brightemployees who can provide quality, timely, and reliable publicgoods and services,'' the report said.   The Boston report follows similar studies by boards in New Yorkand New Jersey last year that found the inability to hire a qualityworkforce has hindered federal agencies.   Boston is one of the nation's most expensive cities to live in.It has had one of the highest rates of inflation throughout the1980s, and home prices and auto insurance rates are among thehighest in the country.   Boston also has one of the tightest labor markets. Costsassociated with employee turnover and recruitment in the Bostonarea amounted to $60 million or nearly 10 percent of the area'sfederal payroll, the report said.   Carl Brauer, a past head of the Public-Private Careers Projectat Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government, saidlow pay is one of many factors contributing to low morale amongfederal employees.   ``The system now has such serious problems. It's worrisome,'' hesaid.   But it would be difficult to raise the salaries of the rank andfile bureaucrats without first raising legislative and judicialsalaries. ``Those salaries put a ceiling on everything else,''Brauer said.   A proposed 50 percent salary increase for members of Congress,federal judges and high-ranking federal executives got a poorpublic reaction and was defeated last winter.   The report urges broad-based legislation to grant the Office ofPersonnel Management the authority to regulate federal salaries andkeep them in line with shifting labor market and recruitmentconditions. Market-based pay, cost of living differentials andrecruitment bonuses are among other board recommendations.   Barry Shapiro, the OPM's deputy director for pay programs,acknowledged that salaries are partly to blame for difficultiesfilling positions with qualified candidates. He said the OPMalready is considering restructuring the federal pay system toconsider regional cost-of-living factors.   ``What we're looking into is coming into some alternativeapproaches for redesigning the system so it would be more marketsensitive,'' he said. ``The pay should be more consistent (with)the demand for that occupation in a given area.''</TEXT></DOC>
