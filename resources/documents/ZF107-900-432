(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Business BBSsandM;Computer bulletin board systems have long been considered mere playthings.andO;Business computer users who hear &quot;BBS&quot; tend to think of 16-year-olds inMetallica T-shirts running a system named after an obscure episode of &quot;StarTrek.&quot;andM;But BBSs can also help home offices run more efficiently, productively, andprofitably.andP;  Bulletin board systems can speed the placing of orders byoutside salespeople and take orders directly from PC-equipped customers.andO;Data is entered electronically, making it easier to avoid mistakes.andP;  Abulletin board can even display a company's latest specials and otherinformation, reducing the need for expensive sales calls.andM;Most bulletin board systems can be customized to match whatever your businessrequires--from a simple single-line message database to a complex multiusersystem that gives your staff and customers direct access to a variety ofprograms on your PC.andM;Setting up and running a bare-bones BBS takes a minimum of software,hardware, and maintenance.andP;  Most computer bulletin board software isavailable as shareware so that small businesses can test thetelecommunications waters before diving in.andM;All bulletin board packages contain the most important features for homeoffices, including message bases, the ability to upload and download files, atext display area for bulletins and news, and various levels of security fordifferent functions.andP;  Doors--the ability to run other software throughgateways in the bulletin board--cost extra.andP;  Otherwise, since the features ofBBS programs are similar, the crucial difference is how easy they are to setup and maintain.andM;Although you can pay thousands for state-of-the-art BBS software packagescapable for handling a nearly infinite number of phone lines, you can get agood single-line BBS package for as little as $50.andP;  If your requirementsgrow, many single-line packages offer upgrades to multiline versions.andM;You can get by with running a BBS on a low-cost XT clone with 640K of RAM, a20MB hard drive, a monochrome graphics card and monitor, a serial port, andan inexpensive 9-pin dot matrix printer.andP;  A 1,200-bit-per-second modem willdo the job, but a 2,400-bps modem can pay for itself on long-distancetransmissions.andM;You may even be able to use a PC you already have in your office withoutrendering it useless for other purposes.andP;  Multitasking environments such asDESQview or Double-DOS let you run a BBS in the background while you work inanother application.andM;If you don't have enough memory for both the BBS and your other applications,or if your bulletin board gets a lot of use, you'll have to dedicate acomputer to it full time.andP;  Compare that expense with the cost of hiringanother staffer to handle voice calls and with the benefits of increasedcustomer satisfaction from faster service and fewer bungled orders.andM;A Dedicated LineandM;You'll want a dedicated phone line for your BBS.andP;  It's possible to configurea multiline phone system to hande a bulletin board, but it can be moredifficult for you and your callers to use.andP;  Having a dedicated line means youcan use the system 24 hours a day without competing with voice calls.andM;Nearly all major BBS packages come ready to run, and setting one up requireslittle more than configuring your system to meet your specific needs.andP;  Amongother items, consider the following possibilities.andM;The opening screen: The display that greets callers when they log on to yourBBS should identify your business and the purpose of the board.andP;  BBS numberscirculate easily among modem users, and you want callers to know where theyare.andP;  The opening screen should give first-time callers clear, simpledirections on how to use the board and get further help.andP;  The screen can alsobe used to communicate the day's news to your field staff or to advertiseproducts.andM;Menus: Create separate menus for your message, uploading and down-loading,and doors sections, as well as greeting and exiting menus.andP;  A main menu tiesthem all together.andP;  Remember to keep the menus simple.andM;Message bases: Most bulleting boards let you set up multiple message sectionswith different security levels accessible only to approved users.andP;  This isparticularly helpful if both staffers and customers use the same board.andP;  Acentral message base can allow all employees to leave memos for one another.andM;Uploading and downloading: A home office BBS makes it easy to transmit dataquickly and accurately.andP;  An upload-download section will let you send andreceive everything from Lotus 1-2-3 worksheets to important business letters.andO;Nearly all BBS packages offer several error-checking transmission protocols,such as Xmodem and Ymodem, in addition to simple ASCII transmissions.andM;Online help: Finally, don't forget to provide access to help file.andP;  All BBSpackages allow the display of text files, and clearly written, conciseexplanations of the commands available at each menu can do wonders toexpedite a call.andP;  It's also not a bad idea to compile the help files intohard copy for your employees to study.andM;It sounds simple and it is, but running a BBS does require a certain amountof maintenance.andP;  You must delete old messages and repack message bases (whicheliminates the empty file space left over from erased messages).andP;  You mustalso update directories of files that are available for downloading.andP;  ManyBBS packages automate these tasks, while others include external programsthat make the jobs relatively painless.andM;Choosing a SystemandM;Of the dozens of shareware and commercial BBS packages on the market, RyBBSand PCBoard are two of the most established products.andP;  RyBBS, a highlycustomizable shareware offering, lets you create nearly everything a usersees, including message bases, menus, and help screens.andP;  RyBBS runs wellunder multitasking program environments such as DESQview, Omniview, andDoubleDOS, and it comes in single-and multiline versions.andM;PCBoard, often considered the BBS standard, is less flexible than RyBBS butmore powerful.andP;  It uses external programs to help set security levels andstructure the system.andP;  PCBoard comes in a variety of versions, fromsingle-line to 99-line.andM;In addition to dedicated products, many general-purpose communicationsprograms, such as ProComm Plus and Crosstalk Mk.4, can be used as bulletinboards.andP;  But they're more of a hassle to set up and may not work as smoothlyas PCBoard or RyBBS.andM;Your best bet is to start with a shareware BBS program to see if you like theway its features work and to figure out how much time it will consume.andP;  Mostshareware BBS programs, including RyBBS, can be downloaded from localbulletin boards or national services such as CompuServe and GEnie.andP;  Once youfind a product you like, pay the registration fee to get the full-blownversion, the documentation, and access to technical support.andP;  Then log on thehigher profits and more efficient service for clients.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
