The NCUA issued a proposed IRPS in March of thisyear to address the entire range of chartering and field of membershipactivities_new charters, field of membership additions, name changes, mergersand spin-offs, and charter conversions. The proposed IRPS, with minor modification,is now made final and replaces IRPS 84-1 entitled ``Membership in FederalCredit Unions,'' the 1980 NCUA manual entitled ``Chartering and OrganizingManual for Federal Credit Unions,'' the 1985 NCUA pamphlet entitled ``Charteringandamp; Organizing of Federal Credit Unions,'' the NCUA Board's decisionson chartering issues made in November 1988, and all other previous NCUAstatements on these matters. IRPS 89-1 will be incorporated into a manualwhich will include a preface, introduction, glossary, sample forms, anda revised list of type of membership codes. The NCUA will publish the manualand distribute it to credit unions in the fall of 1989.The NCUA is also issuing a final rule to update andSection; 701.1 of itsRules and Regulations entitled ``Organizing a Federal credit union'' sothat it references and incorporates IRPS 89-1 into the regulations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>August 28, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>H.

(<T3>See </T3>54 FR 1221.) The proposal was issued with a sixty day commentperiod that was extended by the NCUA Board for thirty additional days dueto public request. The proposed IRPS generally prescribed existing policiesand procedures as set forth in previous publications or as practiced byNCUA staff. Changes in policy were highlighted in the supplementary informationsection to the IRPS. The IRPS is composed of three chapters titled as follows:1_Federal Credit Union Chartering; 2_Changes in Field of Membership; and3_Charter Conversions. CommentersForty-two public comment letters were received. Comments were receivedfrom four national credit union trade associations, five state credit unionleagues, nineteen federally-chartered credit unions, three state-charteredcredit unions, one bank, six banking trade associations, and four individuals.No specific comments were made on Chapter 3_Conversions. The Board hasmade a few minor changes to Chapter 3. They are discussed at the end ofthe Suplementary Information section. A clarification has been made in several places in the IRPS. The NCUA'sgoal of making credit union service available to ``all those who wish tohave it'' has been changed to ``all eligible groups who wish to have it''to clarify that groups must meet field of membership requirements in orderto qualify for credit union service. Minor word changes and grammaticalcorrections made throughout the IRPS are not discussed. The comments were, for the most part, favorable and were made on existingpolicy, rather than the few proposed policy changes set forth in the proposedIRPS. All comments on proposed policy changes are specifically noted. Specificissues addressed in the comment letters and changes made to the IRPS arediscussed below. Issues Raised A number of commenters raised concerns about how NCUA would define ``operatingsatisfactorily.'' This is a factor cited in Chapter 2 under the heading``Reviewing Field of Membership Addition Requests'' as a general prerequisitefor Federal credit unions (FCU's) to receive favorable consideration offield of membership amendment requests. The intent of the IRPS in usingthis terminology was to give the Regional Directors sufficient latitudeto deal with a variety of circumstances. However, in Chapter 2 under theheadings ``Select Group Additions'' and ``Reviewing Field of MembershipRequests'' there is some explanation of the factors to be considered inmaking this judgment. The discussion under these headings states that amongthe criteria to be considered are the applicant credit union's currentfinancial condition and CAMEL rating. Among the comments received werefour which recognized NCUA's need for flexibility in making this evaluationand the inappropriateness of specific negating standards. For instance,if the IRPS was to indicate that <T3>no </T3>FCU's with CAMEL ratings of 3, 4 or 5 would be considered fovorably,then a number of FCU's which either are in an improving status or whichhave problems (such as a declining field of membership) which may bestbe dealt with by field of membership expansions would automatically beexcluded from favorable consideration. The Board has therefore determinednot to specifically define ``operating satisfactorily.''Another generally-defined concept which drew comments was the ``convincingsupport'' required by groups with fewer than 500 potential members whichare seeking a Federal credit union charter. The NCUA Board maintains thatthe economic advisability requirements for a charter applicant cited inChapter 1, II, C. give adequate definition to the terminology. Furthermore,more than half of the respondents who commented on this issue either agreedwith the appropriateness of this language or asked that the Board be evenmore stringent in establishing and enforcing minimum potential member requirements.Since this is an issue (minimum potential member requirements for new charterapplicants) which has been previously considered on two occasions by theNCUA Board and for the above noted reasons, no further review is necessaryand no change in the IRPS is appropriate.In a related vein, several commenters expressed concerns about the requirementplaced on new charter applicants to conduct potential membership surveys.This requirement is set forth in Chapter 1, II, C._``Economic Advisability.''A minimum of 250 potential members must be included in the survey sampleregardless of the new group's total potential membership. This specificrequirement is a new one. Generally, 500 potential members are requiredfor the FCU to have the minimum required economic advisability. The factthat this issue was questioned by only two commenters combined with theneed for ``convincing support'' by applicants with fewer than 500 potentialmembers as expressed above suggests that the policy is reasonable.Another issue which drew comments was whether a business plan should berequired from FCU's seeking significant field of membership expansions.The proposed IRPS stated that ``the Regional Director may, at his discretion,after taking into account the significance of the field of membership expansionproposed, require the applicant to submit a business plan.'' (<T3>See Chapter 2, ``Reviewing Field of Membership Addition Requests.'')</T3>Thecommenters were evenly split on this issue. One of the commenters suggestedthat the NCUA board impose a requirement for a business plan in those instanceswhere the expansion requested involves an addition in excess of 25% ofthe FCU's current membership. Such a modification could work to the NCUA'sand FCU's detriment in a number of situations. For instance, if a largeFCU serving 100,000 members asks to add a group with a potential membershipof 20,000, it may be unnecessary to require a business plan. On the otherhand, it may be necessary for a small FCU serving 200 members to submita business plan in order to add a select group with as few as 50 potentialmembers. The NCUA Board maintains that flexibility in this area is advisableand therefore makes no change to the IRPS.Several respondents commented on the proper channelling of appeals of decisionsby Regional Directors. Chapter 1, X ``Appeals'' and Chapter 2 ``ReviewingField of Membership Requests'' state that appeals to the NCUA Board shouldbe submitted through the appropriate Regional Director. The majority ofthe commenters indicated that the appeals should go directly to the NCUABoard, instead of to the Regional Director whose decision is being appealed.The existing system for processing appeals was not established and is notchanged by this IRPS. It has been in place for some time to accommodateappeals of all types of Regional Director decisions. This IRPS is not thevehicle to accomplish a change in the appeal process. Appeals are not handledby the Regional Offices. They are forwarded by the Region to NCUA's CentralOffice and are investigated and presented to the NCUA Board by staff whoare objective and have had no previous involvement in the case.Service status reports (defined in the IRPS at the end of Chapter 2) asa written summary of the result of FCU efforts to bring service to membersof select groups added) were questioned by a number of commenters. Someof these commenters, including several who supported the concept in general,asked that the IRPS clearly state the purpose of the reports, the specificinformation to be accumulated, and the intervals at which the reports areto be submitted. The IRPS does indicate the fundamental purposes of theservice status reports. In addition to assisting credit union managementin assessing marketing needs and successes, the reports provide the NCUAwith information to evaluate the extent to which an applicant FCU is servingits current potential membership. As far as the specific information tobe reported and the intervals at which the reports are to be submitted,those determinations are best left to the respective Regional Directorsbased on the circumstances involved in each case. Hence, no change is madein this area.Community chartering and field of membership policies received a varietyof comments. First, a number of commenters were concerned about the policychange deleting select group additions for community FCU's. (<T3>See </T3>Chapter 2 ``Community FCU Field of Membership Expansions''and discussion in Supplementary Information section of proposed IRPS.)The Board maintains that the elimination of this alternative for communitycharters is appropriate. In order for a community credit union to expandits field of membership, it must provide evidence that the extended areaof service posseses all of the characteristics of a well-defined community.Upon presentation of such evidence, and satisfaction of all other appropriatecriteria, the community charter's boundaries will be modified and its areaof service will be enlarged. The intent of IRPS 84-1, which first providedcommunity charters access to select groups was to allow community chartersto add such groups outside the described community boundaries, but onlyafter the area outside the boundaries had been shown by applicant FCU torepresent a natural extension of the original community. The Board believesthat community chartering policy should be to encourage service to allof those within the community boundaries and therefore makes no changeto the IRPS.A related question raised by several commenters is what happens to selectgroups located outside of a community charter's specified boundaries whichwere added to a community charter's field of membership during the pastfive years. These groups would continue to have membership eligibilityfrom the community FCU. They would continue to be specifically named inthe community FCU's field of membership.A number of respondents questioned whether partnerships, corporations,and other legal entities (``non-natural persons'') could be included inthe field of membership of community-chartered FCU's without being specificallylisted in Section 5 of the charter. These non-natural persons are legalentities which are located within the boundaries of community charters.One commenter pointed out that Part 705 of the NCUA Rules andamp; Regulationsformerly included discussion about this topic and provided specific wordingfor use in community charter field of memberships. In addition, many communitycharters have assumed that these non-natural persons qualify for membershipunder the general clause ``organizations of such persons.'' The NCUA Boardis persuaded that a clarification is necessary. Hence, a change in theIRPS is appropriate. Chapter 1, Section II, subsection 3, has been modifiedaccordingly. Also, the community field of membership examples have beenmodified to show that business and other entities within the service areacan become members without being specifically listed in the charter.The topic of overlaps (<T3>see</T3> Chapter 1, II, C, 2.) received the attention of a number ofcommenters. Most commenters agreed with the approach to overlaps expressedin the IRPS. The remarks about overlaps from a credit union trade associationcommenter are particularly noteworthy. The commenter indicates that proceduresto deal with material and potentially troublesome overlaps have been addressedby NCUA but similar procedures have not been forthcoming from state regulators'offices. The commenter encourages NCUA to develop agreements with eachof the state regulators which will facilitate to two-way flow of informationregarding overlaps or potential overlaps that are consistent with the dualchartering policy. The Board believes that its overlap policy as set forthin the IRPS is appropriate. However, NCUA continues to pursue such agreementswith state regulators.The policy of granting cross-regional associational charters and fieldof membership expansions (<T3>see </T3>Chapter 1, IV_``Widely-Dispersed Associated Charters'') drewa number of comments. Most of the commenters agreed with the position takenin the IRPS which mandates that affected Regional Directors vote on suchexpansions and charters. Several commenters indicated complete oppositionto such charters/expansions and asked for a total prohibition of such groups.Two other commenters indicated that the policy is an overreaction to thegranting of a few charters. The NCUA Board continues to believe that thispolicy, adopted last year, is reasonable and appropriate and that it shouldbe left intact. A clarification that this policy applies to expansionsis made to Chapter 2 at the end of the Section entitled ``Select GroupAdditions.''Several commenters recommended that the term ``expansion'' be deleted fromChapter 2 of the IRPS and that some other similar term such as ``adjustment,''``change,'' ``addition,'' or ``amendment'' be substituted therefore. Theterm ``expansion'' was eliminated where possible prior to the publicationof the proposed IRPS. Accordingly, no further substitutions/changes havebeen made.The retiree/senior citizens policy received several comments. This policyis set forth in Chapter 2_``Addition of Retiree or Senior Citizen Associations''and has been NCUA policy since 1984. All credit union comments were supportiveof the policy. Letters from four bankers' associations opposed the policy.This policy is not new and is generally considered to be noncontroversial.Hence, no change is made.The issue of background/credit checks for prospective officials/employeesof new FCU's received unanimously favorable comments. This is addressedin Chapter 1, II, C, 1, b_``Proposed Management's Character and Fitness.''One commenter suggested that some type of safeguards be added to prevent``straw man'' officials from circumventing the policy's purpose. Althoughthe Board recognizes this concern as genuine, we believe that the commitmentto serve document that each prospective official must sign is a reasonablecounterbalance. No threats/punitive actions would be appropriate sincethe Board does not wish to discourage persons from serving in these largelyvolunteer capacities. Therefore, no changes are made.Several comments were received about the section in Chapter 1 entitled``Appropriateness of Proposed Federal Credit Union Name.'' (<T3>See</T3> Chapter 1, III.) These limits on the naming of FCU's are longstandingNCUA policy. However, this is the first time they have been set forth inan IRPS. Although the commenters were generally in agreement with the discussionin the proposed IRPS, one commenter wanted the list of inappropriate namesexpanded to include names used by other financial institutions and by theU.S. Government. There is in existence a criminal statute prohibiting misuseof titles of federally-insured institutions. Since it is required thatthe last three words of every Federal credit union's name must be ``FederalCredit Union,'' no modification to this section is necessary.The issue of emergency mergers/purchase and assumptions received a numberof comments. (<T3>See</T3> Chapter 2 section entitled ``Additions Via Mergers and Purchaseand Assumptions.'') The credit union commenters supported the policy inthe proposed IRPS, the bankers' associations were opposed. The bankers'associations claimed generally that the policy results in dilution of thecommon bond. The Board maintains that the latitude permitted in this subsectionof the IRPS is good public policy since it serves to reduce the exposureto loss by the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund. Also, the consolidationof a troubled credit union's field of membership with an effectively-operatedFCU does not create new credit union service. Existing eligibility formembership is simply transferred from one credit union to another. Theseare not new NCUA policies and the NCUA Board believes no change to themis necessary.The requirement for new charter applicants to enter into a Letter of Understandingandamp; Agreement (LUA) received several comments. This issue is discussedin Chapter 1, VIII entitled ``LUA's.'' LUA's have been traditionally usedwith new charters. One commenter stated that it should be made clear tothe officials of a new FCU that the terms and conditions in the LUA's maybe modified. Accordingly, a change has been made to Exhibit B of the IRPSadding a seventh clause to the specimen LUA to read ``As the credit union'sofficials gain experience and the credit union achieves target levels ofgrowth and profitability, the above terms and conditions may be renegotiatedby the two parties.'' Another commenter asked that NCUA specify the precisecircumstances under which an LUA will be required. The IRPS states thatLUA's will be required for most new charter applicants.The policy on chambers of commerce and similar organization drew severalcomments. The policy set forth in the proposed IRPS prohibiting inclusionof the employees of member of a chamber of commerce, or similar association,in a credit union's field of membership elicited several negative comments.The IRPS states that if an FCU wishes to serve the employees of a membersof a chamber of commerce or similar professional organization (e.g., employeesof member of a bar or medical association, employees of a franchisee),it must follow the procedures for field of membership expansion set forthin the select group expansion section. Although this may be considereda tightening of chartering and expansion policies, it does not eliminatethe availability of credit union service to any group. Hence the Boardmakes no change to the proposed IRPS.One commenter wanted the IRPS to assure new charter applicants that theirproposed field of membership would be given consideration early on in thechartering process. Although the IRPS does not directly address this concern,there is a full discussion of what types of fields of membership are appropriateand inappropriate. Charter applicants should deal with field of membershipissues up-front. The Regional Offices are prepared to answer any questionsand settle any uncertainties pertaining to field of membership which thecharter applicant is unable to resolve by reading the IRPS. Therefore,no change is made.One commenter recommended that there be specific discussion and encouragementin the IRPS relating to FCU service to high school student groups. Chapter1, II, A, 2 notes that student groups constitute an associational commonbond. High school student groups do qualify as student groups. It shouldbe noted that high school student groups may be added to an existing Federalcredit union under the policy pertaining to select associational groupexpansions. Of course, all other select groups expansion requirements mustbe met.Though no comments were received on charter conversions (Chapter 3), NCUAtook a final look at the subject and found some additional ways to streamlineand clarify the state-to-Federal charter conversion process. The threesignificant changes were: (1) Addition of specific reference to the needand timing for submitting Form NCUA 4000 (Federal Credit Union InvestigationReport, Conversion of State Charter to Federal Charter); (2) deletion,as unnecessary, of the requirement to submit a Form NCUA 5300; and (3)addition of specific reference to the time when an NCUA on-site reviewwill be conducted.Comments were received recommending that the introduction or preface tobe part of the manual incorporating the IRPS contain a thorough discussionof credit union uniqueness, philosophy, and the common bond. The introductionto the manual will contain such a discussion. Another commenter recommendedthat a ``glossary'' be added to furnish definitions of special terminologysuch as ``select group'' and ``multiple group charter.'' The Board believesthis recommendation is a good one, hence a glossary will be included aspart of the manual.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Procedures</ITAG>Regulatory Flexibility ActAs was noted in the proposed IRPS, the NCUA Board has determined and certifiesthat changes to NCUA policy resulting from adoption of the IRPS will nothave a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small creditunions (those under $1 million in asset size); changes are directed atclarification of existing policy rather than creation of new restrictions.Therefore, a regulatory flexibility analysis has not been performed.Paperwork Reduction ActThis IRPS does contain several collection requirements. All of the collectionrequirements contained in the IRPS and NCUA forms which will be a partof the manual were submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)for approval in early June. We have not yet heard from OMB. A notice ofOMB approval will be published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> upon its receipt. Any comments regarding collectionrequirements should be sent to the NCUA, Administrative Office, 1776 GStreet, NW., Washington, DC 20456; and to Gary Waxman, OMB, Room 3228,NEOB, Washington, DC 20503.Executive Order 12612Implementation of the IRPS will not affect the state regulation of eitherfederally- or state-chartered credit unions.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 701</ITAG>Credit union, Field of membership, Chartering, Field of membership addition,Mergers, Conversions.<ITAG tagnum="21">By the National Credit Union Administration Board on July 20, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Becky Baker,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Secretary, NCUA Board.</ITAG>Accordingly, NCUA amends 12 CFR Part 701, supersedes IRPS 84-1 and establishesthe following IRPS 89-1 as follows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 701_ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF FEDERAL CREDIT UNIONS</ITAG>1.

Goals of NCUA Chartering PolicyNCUA's chartering policies are directed toward achieving three goals:A. To uphold the provisions of the Federal Credit Union Act concerninggranting Federal charters;B. To promote credit union safety and soundness; andC. To make quality credit union service available to all eligible groupswho wish to have it.II. Who May Apply for a Federal Credit Union CharterNCUA may grant a charter to any group where it finds:<ITAG tagnum="15">_The group possesses a recognizable and appropriate common bond;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_The subscribers are of good character and are fit to represent thegroup; and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Establishment of the credit union is economically advisable_i.e.,it will be a viable institution and its chartering will not materiallyaffect the interests of other credit unions or the credit union system.</ITAG>Generally, these are the only criteria NCUA will look to. In unusual circumstances,however, NCUA may consider other factors, such as other Federal law orpublic policy in deciding if a charter should be approved.A. <T3>Common Bond</T3>. Congress has recognized three types of Federal creditunion common bonds: occupational, associational, and community. A Federalcredit union may also consist of a combination of occupational and associationalgroups_for example, NCUA may charter a Federal credit union consistingof employees of a local school district and members of a church group.Individual groups have their own common bond. All of the groups belongingto one particular credit union (i.e., listed in Section 5 of the creditunion's charter) make up the credit union's field of membership.If the charter is granted, the Federal credit union will only be able togrant loans and provide services to persons within the groups defined inthe charter. If the Federal credit union later wishes to add persons toits field of membership, it must submit a charter amendment request toNCUA in accordance with the procedures set forth in Chapter 2.1. <T3>Occupational Common Bond. </T3>NCUA has limited this common bond toemployment by the same enterprise. Persons sharing this common bond maybe geographically dispersed. Employees of a parent corporation and itswholly-owned subsidiaries and persons under contract to work regularlyfor an enterprise may be considered under a single occupational bond. Eachcategory to be served (e.g., subsidiaries, contractors) must be separatelylisted. Persons with different employers, even if closely related geographically_personsworking at a single shopping center, industrial park, or office building,for example_are not treated as having a single common bond, but will beconsidered under NCUA's community or multiple-group charter policies.All occupational common bonds will include a geographic definition: e.g.,``employees, officials, and persons who work under contract regularly forABC Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, who work in Miami, Florida.''Other acceptable geographic definitions are: ``employees * * * who arepaid from * * *'' or ``employees * * * who are supervised from * * *.''The employer may also be included in this common bond_e.g., ``ABC Corporationand its subsidiaries.'' The employer will be defined in the last clausedescribing the group.Some examples of occupational group definitions are:a. ``Employees of the Scott Manufacturing Company who work in Chester,Pennsylvania * * *.''b. ``Employees and elected and appointed officials of municipal governmentin Parma, Ohio * * *.''c. ``Employees of Johnson Soap Company and its majority-owned subsidiary,Johnson Toothpaste Company, who work in Augusta and Portland, Maine * **.''d. ``Personnel of fleet units of the U.S. Navy home ported at Mayport,Florida * * *.''e. ``Civilian and military personnel of the U.S. Government who work orare stationed at, or are attached or assigned to Fort Belvoir, Virginia,or those who are retired from, or their dependents or dependent survivorswho are eligible by law or regulations to receive and are receiving benefitsor services from, that military installation * * *.''f. ``Employees of these contractors who work regularly at U.S. Naval Shipyardin Bremerton, Washington * * *.''g. ``Employees, doctors, medical staff, technicians, medical and nursingstudents who work at Boston Medical Center at the locations stated: * **.''h. ``Employees and teachers who work for the School District Number 3 inAustin, Texas * * *.''Some examples of insufficiently defined occupational groups are:a. ``Employees of engineering firms in Seattle, Washington.'' (No commonemployer; names of firms must be stated; however, may be the basis fora multiple group.)b. ``Persons employed or working in Chicago, Illinois.'' (No common employer;names of firms must be stated.) c. ``Persons working in the entertainment industry in California.'' (Nocommon employer; names of firms must be stated.)2. <T3>Associational Common Bonds. </T3>NCUA limits this common bond to groupsconsisting primarily of individuals (natural persons) who participate inactivities developing common loyalties, mutual benefits, and mutual interests.Qualifying associational groups must hold meetings open to all naturalperson members at least once a year, must sponsor other activities providingfor contact among natural person members, and must have an authoritativedefinition of who is eligible for membership_usually, this will be theassociation's constitution and bylaws. The clarity of the associationalgroup's definition and compactness of its membership will be importantcriteria in reviewing the application. NCUA policy is to organize associationalcharters at the lowest organizational level which is economically feasible.Student groups constitute an associational common bond and may qualifyfor a Federal credit union charter.Associations formed primarily to obtain a credit union charter do not havea sufficient associational common bond; nor do associations based on aclient or customer relationship_an insurance company's customers or a buyer'sclub, for example.NCUA normally charters associational Federal credit unions consisting ofnatural person members. In certain instances, NCUA will allow nonnaturalpersons (e.g. corporate sponsor or organizations of members) to be eligiblefor membership.Moreover, the common bond extends only to the association's members. Theemployees of a member of a local chamber of commerce, for example, do nothave a sufficiently close tie to the association to be included. A proposalto include these persons among those to be served by the Federal creditunion will be considered as a multiple-group charter application.Homeowner associations, tenant groups, electric co-ops, consumer groupsand other groups of persons having an ``interest in'' a particular causeand certain consumer cooperatives may be eligible to receive a Federalcharter; however, they must make a strong showing of common activitiesand economic viability. Newly-organized associations must make a similarshowing; experience has shown that a new group's efforts are best focusedon solidifying member interest before attempting to offer credit unionservice.All associational common bonds will include a definition of the group anda geographic or ``operational area'' limitation_unless the constitutionor bylaws of the associational group limit the geographical area_e.g.,``Members of the ABC Association living or working in New York, New York,who qualify for membership in accordance with its constitution and bylawsin effect on January 21, 1989.''The association itself may also be included in the field of membership_e.g.,``ABC Association.''Some examples of associational group definitions are:a. ``Regular members of Locals 10 and 13, IBEW Union, Miami, Florida, whoqualify for membership in accordance with their constitution and bylawsin effect on May 20, 1989.''b. ``Members of the Hoosier Farm Bureau who live or work in Grant, Logan,or Lee Counties of Indiana, who qualify for membership in accordance withits constitution and bylaws in effect on March 7, 1980.''c. ``Members of the Mennonite Church who live or work in the State of Kansas.''d. ``Members of the Shalom Congregation who live in Chevy Chase, Maryland.''e. ``Regular members of the Corporate Executives Association, located inWestchester, New York, who live or work in Westchester, Rockland, and SuffolkCounties in New York, who qualify for membership in accordance with itsconstitution and bylaws in effect on December 1, 1985.''f. ``Members of the Northern Michigan Electric Co-op located in Marquette,Michigan.''Some examples of insufficiently defined associational group definitionsare:a. ``Members of military service clubs in the State of New Mexico.'' (Nosingle associational tie; specific clubs and locations must be named; maybe considered as multiple group).b. ``Veterans of U.S. military service.''Some examples of unacceptable associational common bonds are:a. ``ABC Buyers Club.'' (An interest in purchasing only does not meet associationalstandards.)b. ``Customers of ABC Insurance Company.'' (Policyholders or customer/clientrelationships do not meet associational standards.)3. <T3>Community Common Bonds. </T3>Congress has required that a credit unioncharter that will be based on a tie to a specific geographic location belimited to ``a well-defined neighborhood, community, or rural district.''NCUA policy is to limit the community to a single, compact, well-definedarea where residents commingle and interact regularly. NCUA recognizestwo types of affinity on which a community charter bond can be based: residenceand employment. Businesses and other legal entities within the communityboundaries may also qualify for membership. Given the diversity of communitycharacteristics throughout the country and NCUA's goal of making creditunion service available to all eligible groups who wish to have it, NCUAhas established the following common bond requirements:a. The geographic area's boundaries must be clearly defined; andb. The charter applicant must establish that the area is recognized bythose who live and work there as a distinct ``neighborhood, community,or rural district.''A typical definition of a community-based common bond is: ``Persons wholive or work in and businesses and other legal entities located in ABC,the area of XYZ City bounded by Fern Street on the north, Long Street onthe east, Fouth Street on the south, and Elm Avenue on the west.''If the community is also a recognized legal entity, it may also be includedin the field of membership_e.g., ``DEF Township.''Some examples of community common bond definitions are:a. ``Persons who live or work in ABC County, Maine.''b. ``Persons who live or work in and businesses and other legal entitieslocated in Independent School District No. 1, ABC County, Minnesota.''c. ``Persons who live or work within a ten-mile radius of Walnut, Illinois''(Rural areas only.)Some examples of insufficiently defined community common bond definitionsare:a. ``Persons who live or work within <T3>and businesses located within </T3>a ten-mile radius of Washington,D.C.'' (Not a recognized ``neighborhood, community, or rural district.)b. ``Persons who live or work in the industrial section of XYZ, New York.''4. <T3>Multiple-Group Charters. </T3>NCUA may charter a Federal credit unionto serve a combination of distinct, definable occupational and/or associationalgroups. However, NCUA will not charter as a single Federal credit unionmultiple groups which include one based on a community common bond.In addition to general chartering requirements, special requirements pertainingto multiple-group applications must be satisfied before NCUA will grantsuch a charter.a. Each group to be included in the proposed field of membership of theFederal credit union must have its own common bond.b. Each group must individually request inclusion in the proposed Federalcredit union's charter.c. All groups must be within the operational area of a planned home orbranch office of the proposed Federal credit union. ``Operational area''is an area surrounding the home or a branch office that can be reasonablyserved by the applicant as determined by NCUA. For chartering purposes,``branch office'' means any office of a Federal credit union where an employeeaccepts payment on shares and disburses loans. An ATM or similar cash disbursingmachine does not qualify as a ``branch office.''An example of a multiple-group field of membership is:``The field of membership of this Federal credit union shall be limitedto those having the following common bond:1. Employees of DuPont Corp. who work in Wilmington, Delaware;2. Partners and employees of the law firm of Smith andamp; Jones who workin Wilmington, Delaware;3. Members of the GHI Associations who live in Wilmington, Delaware, andqualify for membership in accordance with its constitution and bylaws.5. <T3>Other Persons Sharing Common Bond. </T3>A number of persons by virtueof their close relationship to a common bond group may be included at thecharter applicant's option in the field of membership:a. ``Spouses of persons who died while within the field of membership ofthis credit union'';b. ``Employees of this credit union'';c. ``Persons retired as pensioners or annuitants from the above employment'';d. ``Members of their immediate families'';e. ``Volunteers'';f. ``Organizations of such persons.''``Members of their immediate families'' may be generally defined as deemedappropriate by a Federal credit union when including this group among thoseto be served. To be made effective, however, the Federal credit union'sboard of directors must approve the definition by resolution, and includeit in Article XVIII, Section 2, of its bylaws. The single exception isfor those Federal credit unions serving student groups: only the ``membersof the immediate families'' of students who actually join the Federal creditunion may be included. NCUA defines this secondary group for student groupsas follows: ``Members of the immediate families of students who are membersof this credit union.''Volunteers, by virtue of their close relationship with a sponsor group,may be included. Examples include volunteers working at a hospital or ina church.Under Article II, Section 5, of NCUA's Standard Bylaws, if a member leavesthe field of membership, standard member services will be terminated. However,the board of directors may, by resolution, set forth the circumstancesunder which a member may maintain membership. This option is commonly referredto as the ``once a member, always a member'' bylaw provision.B. <T3>Character and Fitness of Subscribers.</T3> The Federal Credit UnionAct requires that seven or more natural persons must present to NCUA forapproval a sworn organization certificate stating at a minimum:1. The name of the proposed Federal credit union;2. The location of the proposed Federal credit union and the territoryin which it will operate;3. The names and addresses of the subscribers to the certificate and thenumber of shares subscribed by each;4. The initial par value of the shares;5. The proposed field of membership, specified in detail;6. The term of the existence of the corporation, which may be perpetual;and7. The fact that the certificate is made to enable such persons to availthemselves of the advantages of the Federal Credit Union Act.These seven or more persons will be the proposed Federal credit union's``subscribers.'' False statements on this certificate may be grounds forFederal criminal prosecution.The Act also requires NCUA to satisfy itself as to the ``general characterand fitness'' of these subscribers. These persons, therefore, may be thesubject of credit and background investigations at NCUA's discretion.C. <T3>Economic Advisability.</T3> Before chartering a Federal credit union,NCUA must be assured that the institution will be viable and that it willnot materially affect existing state or Federal credit unions. This economicadvisability inquiry has become especially important since 1970, when Congressassigned NCUA the obligation to establish a Fund insuring credit unionshares and to preserve that Fund.NCUA will conduct an independent on-site investigation for each charterapplication to assure itself that the proposal can be successful.1. <T3>The Proposed Federal Credit Union's Viability.</T3> The success ofany credit union depends on: (a) The depth of the members' support; (b)the character and fitness of management; and (c) present and projectedmarket conditions.a. <T3>Member Support.</T3> While NCUA has not set a minimum size field ofmembership for chartering a Federal credit union, experience has shownthat a credit union with under 500 potential members generally is unlikelyto succeed. A charter applicant with a proposed field of membership ofunder 500 will have to demonstrate convincing support for the credit union.For example, in an occupational group a commitment for significant long-termsupport from the employer must be in evidence.The group's size is only of help if members participate in the credit union.The charter applicant must show that a substantial percentage of the group'smembers will join the credit union and use its services. Survey resultsmust be based at a minimum on a sampling of 250 potential members. In particularinstances, especially where the common bond is broadly-defined or newly-established,NCUA may require a larger sampling.b. <T3>Proposed Management's Character and Fitness. </T3>The applicant mustprovide a list of the persons who will serve as officials. NCUA will conducta credit and background (including criminal record) investigation on eachof the proposed Federal credit union's officials. NCUA also reserves theright to perform such checks on employees of the applicant FCU. The Agencywill also need assurance that the management team will have the requisiteskills_particularly in leadership and accounting_and the commitment todedicate the time and effort needed to make the Federal credit union asuccess.c. <T3>Present and Future Market Conditions: </T3>The ability to compete inthe marketplace and to adapt to changing market conditions is key to thesurvival of any enterprise, and a crucial part of that is the ability toplan well. NCUA, therefore, requires an applicant to submit a businessplan based on realistic and supportable projections and assumptions, including,as a minimum, these elements:i. Mission statement;ii. Analysis of market conditions_economic prospects for the group, availabilityof financial services from credit unions, banks, Sandamp;Ls; iii. Summary of survey results;iv. Financial services needed/desired;v. Financial services to be provided;vi. How/when services are to be implemented;vii. Staffing of credit union and credentials of key employees;viii. Physical facility_office, equipment;ix. Type of recordkeeping system;x. Budget for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd year;xi. Semiannual pro forma financial statements for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd year,including assumptions_e.g., loans and dividend rates;xii. Goals for number of members;xiii. Goals for operating independently;xiv. Source of funds to pay expenses during initial months of operation;xv. Written policies (lending, investments, funds management);xvi. Goals for dividends, generation of resources;xvii. Plan for continuity_directors, committee members; and xviii. Evidence of sponsor commitment if subsidies are critical to successof the Federal credit union.NCUA expects that the subscribers and proposed officials will understandand support the business plan submitted.2. <T3>Overlaps. </T3>(This discussion pertains to new charters as well asexisting charters.)An overlap exists when a group of persons is eligible for membership intwo or more credit unions, including state charters. General policy requiresthat every effort be made to avoid an overlap. Ideally, a group of personsshould be included in the field of membership in only one credit union.Both new and existing credit unions are obligated to investigate the possibilityof an overlap prior to submitting and application for a new charter oradding a group, by surveying the prospective field of membership and contactingthe state credit union supervisor and the local credit union league ortrade association. If and when an overlap situation does arise, officialsof the involved credit unions are encouraged to work out the overlap problembetween or among themselves. If the matter is resolved informally, theapplicant must submit a letter to that effect from the credit union whosefield of membership already includes the subject group. If no resolutionis possible, an application for a new charter or expansion may still besubmitted, but must also include information regarding the overlap anddocument attempts at informal resolution. In any event, the applicant Federalcredit union must clearly indicate why a new credit union or expansionis being sought and why existing and potential members of the current creditunion will support and join a newly-chartered or expanded Federal creditunion.When resolution of an overlap problem is not forthcoming, and other circumstanceswarrant an overlap, then an overlap may be permitted. Among the circumstanceswhich may justify an overlap are: (1) Failure of the original credit unionto provide service to the group, (2) limited participation by members oremployees of the group in the original credit union after the expirationof a reasonable period of time, and (3) incidental overlap (the group ofpersons in question is so small as to have no material effect on the originalcredit union). In reviewing the overlap, the Regional Directors will considerthe nature of the problem; efforts made to resolve the situation; financialeffect on the overlapped credit union; the desires of the group(s); theopinion of the state credit union supervisor, if applicable, and otherinterested parties; and the best interests of the involved potential orcurrent members. In general, NCUA will not protect associational and communitycharters from overlaps with occupational charters.A number of situations may not justify approval of a requested overlap.For example, if the requesting credit union offers certain specializedservices not offered by the original credit union (such as credit cards,ATMs, and IRAs), the extra services alone may not justify the overlap.Also, proximity, by itself, does not warrant approval of an overlap. AFederal credit union in Chicago, Illinois, may not have a convincing argument,based on geography alone, that a select employee group (SEG) also locatedin Chicago would be better served by it than by the SEG's headquarterscredit union located in Dallas, Texas.From an overlap prevention perspective, new charter applicants and everyoccupational or associational group which comes before the Regional Directorsfor affiliation with an existing Federal credit union must advise in writingwhether the group is included within the field of membership on any othercredit union. This requirement will alert the Regional Directors to possibleoverlap situations before they occur. Thus, most potential field of membershipconflicts can be avoided. If cases do arise where the assurance given toa Regional Director concerning unavailability of credit union service turnsout later to be inaccurate, the misinformation is grounds for removal ofthe group from the Federal credit union's charter.3. <T3>Exclusionary Clauses.</T3> (This discussion pertains to new chartersas well as existing charters.)In certain instances, exclusionary wording prohibiting certain overlapsmay be used to help define the field of membership of a Federal creditunion. Use of exclusionary wording should be avoided if possible. Generally,a thorough investigation of a charter application or an application fora field of membership expansion will disclose the situations where othercredit union service is available. The field of membership should be writtenso that only the specific locations where credit union service is not currentlyavailable are allotted to the new charter or to the Federal credit unionseeking the field of membership addition.However, certain cases exist where a specific recitation of work locations(for an occupational group) or member locations (for an associational group)is not feasible. Corporations or associations with widely-dispersed employeesor members fall into this ``exception'' category. In these special cases,exclusionary wording could be used to provide some limits on an extensivefield of membership. An example might be employees of XYZ Corporation whereXYZ Corporation is a relatively new company which specializes in acquisitionsand divestitures and its corporate makeup is constantly changing. In thiscase the field of membership could be described as ``employees of XYZ Corporationwho work in the United States, except employees eligible for membershipin another occupational-type credit union serving an employee unit of XYZCorporation.''Another situation which may require exclusionary wording is the charteringof a new community credit union or the field of membership conversion ofan existing occupational or associational credit union to a community charter.Although investigation may show that the residents of the proposed areaof service by and large do not have access to a credit union, other creditunions may be operating in the community which desire to remain autonomousentities. If the Regional Director determines that avoidance of overlapis warranted, an exclusionary clause may be inserted in the community creditunion's field of membership. Examples of exclusionary wording are as follows:1. Persons who reside or work in Portland, Maine, except persons eligiblefor primary membership in ABC Employees Federal Credit Union or PortlandCity Employees Credit Union as of the date of this charter;2. Persons who reside or work in Hilo, Hawaii, except employees of HiloSugar Company and the United States Government.The exclusionary language in a community charter's field of membershipordinarily applies only to ``primary'' members of existing occupational-typecredit unions. ``Primary'' is defined as the basic occupational or associationalaffinity to the field of membership defined in section 5 of the charter.In example 1 above, assuming that the two excluded Federal credit unionshave single sponsor fields of membership, only employees of ABC Companyand of the City of Portland would be excluded. Family members (or othersecondary or derivative members) are not excluded. Also, unless specialcircumstances warrant, only occupational field of membership will be protectedby the exclusion. That is, associational, multiple group and other communitycredit unions will not normally be afforded protection from overlap. Finally,by dating the exclusion, only those employee units in the field(s) of membershipof the protected credit union(s) as of the specified date are excludedfrom membership eligibility in the community credit union. Thus, groupsadded by an occupational credit union subsequent to the establishment ofthe community charter are not excluded from the community credit union.In the second example above, dating the exclusion clause, which is writtenvery specifically, is inappropriate.Although use of exclusionary clauses by NCUA will normally be on an exceptionbasis only, Regional Directors may, at their discretion, apply exclusionarywording to a credit union's field of membership. However, the clauses shallnot be used in lieu of a thorough investigation of the availability ofexisting credit union service by a charter applicant or an applicant fora field of membership addition. Furthermore, it is NCUA's intent to useexclusionary clauses only to increase the vitality and strength of thecredit union system, not to prevent people from obtaining credit unionservice.III. Appropriateness of Proposed Federal Credit Union NameIt is the responsibility of the Federal credit union organizers to ensurethat the FCU applicant's name or FCU name change does not constitute aninfringement on the name of any corporation in their trade area. Priorto granting a charter or approving a name change, NCUA will ensure thatthe credit union's name: (a) is not already being used by another Federalcredit union; (b) will not be confused with NCUA or another Federal orState agency, or with another credit union; and (c) does not include inappropriatelanguage. The last three words in the name of every credit union charteredby NCUA must be ``Federal Credit Union.''IV. Widely-Dispersed Associational ChartersNCUA policy is to charter associational Federal credit unions at the lowestorganization level which is economically feasible. This does not precludethe granting of associational charters with widely-dispersed memberships.NCUA may grant such charters after scrutinizing the adequacy of the applicant'scommon bond. NCUA may, at its discretion, require that the proposed fieldof membership be narrowed before granting a new charter; expansion to includea large portion of the association's members may be allowed at a latertime if appropriate. Also, as with any widely-dispersed group, overlap issues are likely toarise, either at the time of or subsequent to chartering. NCUA <T3>will</T3> consider the effect that granting a charter with such a groupin its field of membership would have on any number of existing creditunions. In addition, an associational credit union with a widely-dispersedmembership may expect overlaps to be granted to other credit unions inthe future, particularly at the local level. In recognition of these unique problems, NCUA follows a separate internalprocedure for associational charter applications for associations withproposed fields of membership of 500 or more persons which cross NCUA regionalboundaries. NCUA's Director of Examination and Insurance and all NCUA RegionalDirectors with any of the association's members located in their regionmust vote on the charter application. A majority vote is required for approvals;tie votes are referred directly to the NCUA Board for decision; denialsare appealable to the Board.V. Industrial Parks, Shopping Centers and Similar Groupings A Federal charter may be available to persons working in a particular industrialpark or shopping mall, either as community-based or as a multiple group.If the multiple group option is selected, all multiple group requirementsmust be met. Each employee group within the industrial park or shoppingcenter must submit a letter requesting service. Only those groups submittingletters will be added to the charter. If the community option is selected,the industrial park or shopping center must meet the standards for communitycharters. VI. Specially-Designated Federal Credit UnionsSome credit unions are recognized and designated by NCUA to perform certainfunctions different from those available to Federal credit unions in general.An applicant wishing to be considered for such a designation may, at thetime of charter application, provide the additional information NCUA needs.NCUA will then consider the designation and the charter application together.The designation can also be applied for at a later time if all the requirementsare met. A. <T3>Low-Income Credit Union.</T3> A low-income credit union is definedas one where a majority of its members fall into one or more of these categories:(1) Those whose annual income falls at or below the lower-level standardof living classification as established by the Bureau of Labor Statisticsand as updated by the Employment and Training Administration of the U.S.Department of Labor; (2) those who are residents of a public housing projectwho qualify for such residency because of low income; (3) those who qualifyas recipients in a community action program; (4) those who are enrolledas full-time or part-time students in a college, university, high school,or vocational school. The Federal credit union applicant should forwarda separate request for a low-income designation at the time the applicationis submitted with appropriate documentation. A credit union designated by NCUA as a low-income credit union has greaterflexibility in accepting nonmember deposits insured by NCUA. The creditunion may also participate in special funding such as the Community DevelopmentRevolving Loan Program for Credit Unions if it is involved in the stimulationof economic development activities and community revitalization efforts.B. <T3>Corporate Federal Credit Union.</T3> A corporate credit union is definedas: (1) One that is operated primarily for the purpose of serving othercredit unions; and (2) one whose total dollar amount of outstanding loansto member credit unions plus shares issued to member credit unions equalsor exceeds 75 percent of its total outstanding loans plus shares and deposits.They are governed by different reserving and other standards as set forthin Part 704 of NCUA's Rules and Regulations.VII. How To Apply for a Federal Credit Union CharterA. <T3>Organizing a Federal Credit Union.</T3> Federal credit unions are organizedby persons who donate time and resources and are responsible for determiningthe interest, commitment, and advisability of forming a Federal creditunion. The organization of a Federal credit union takes considerable planningand dedication in order to ensure the success of the new credit union.Persons interested in organizing a Federal credit union should contactthe NCUA Regional Director serving the state in which the credit unionwill be organized or their state credit union league. A list of NCUA officesis attached as Exhibit A to this Chapter. NCUA will provide informationto groups interested in pursuing a Federal charter and will assist themin obtaining an organizer. A credit union organizer may be a trade association representative, anNCUA examiner, or a volunteer with training and experience in charteringnew Federal credit unions. The functions of the organizer are to providedirection, guidance, and advice on the chartering process. The organizeralso provides the group with information about a credit union's functionsand purpose as well as technical assistance in preparing and submittingthe charter application. Close communication and cooperation between theorganizer and the group members is critical to the chartering process.Once the group has decided to apply for a Federal credit union charterand the organizer is satisfied that the application has merit, the groupshould elect 7 to 10 persons to serve as subscribers. The subscribers andorganizer will work together to ensure that information required in theFederal Credit Union Investigation Report (NCUA 4001 for Federal creditunion applicants or NCUA 4000 for applications to convert to a Federalcharter) is well supported and documented. The organizer and subscribersshould develop a business plan as discussed earlier in this chapter. Thesubscribers should also locate willing individuals capable of serving onthe board of directors, credit committee, supervisory committee, and astreasurer/manager of the proposed credit union. This documentation willbe submitted along with other chartering documents by the organizer followingthe charter organization meeting. A charter organization meeting will be called as soon as the subscribersand organizer are satisfied that the required chartering information hasbeen collected. The charter organization meeting should be attended byall subscribers, persons who have agreed to serve on the board or committees,and any other potential members of the credit union. At this meeting, theorganizer will discuss the progress and conclusions of the charter investigation,will announce the proposed slate of officials, and will respond to anyquestions posed at the meeting. When satisfied that the group meets allthe chartering requirements, the subscribers should then sign and havenotarized two copies of the Organization Certificate (NCUA 4008) and providethis to the organizer for inclusion in the charter application. As theirfinal duty, the subscribers will elect the board of directors and creditcommittee of the proposed Federal credit union. The charter organizationmeeting should then be adjourned. Following the charter organization meeting, the board of directors shouldmeet to elect officers and appoint members of the supervisory committee.The credit and supervisory committees should then meet to elect their respectivechairmen and secretaries. The minutes of these and all future board ofdirectors and committee meetings should be kept and safeguarded by theirrespective secretaries. Each official should execute a copy of Report ofOfficials and Agreement to Serve (NCUA 4012) to be submitted with the charterapplication package. The board of directors should take action to apply for insurance of memberaccounts. The Certificate of Resolutions (NCUA 9501) should be executedby the president and secretary. Following action on this issue, the presidentand treasurer should execute the Application and Agreements for Issuanceof Accounts (NCUA 9500). These documents should be provided to the organizeras part of the charter application. These actions conclude the major activitiesfor the first meeting of the board of directors. B. <T3>Support for Charter Application. </T3>As discussed previously in thisChapter, applicants for Federal credit union charters must, at a minimum,provide evidence that: The group constitutes a recognized common bond; The subscribers are of good character; and The establishment of the credit union is economically feasible. In addition, the Federal Credit Union Act requires applicants to submita sworn organization certificate setting forth seven criteria (see SectionII B of this Chapter). In order to process the application and captureall required information, NCUA has developed certain chartering forms toassist organizers. 1. <T3>Federal Credit Union Investigation Report.</T3> Applications for newFederal credit unions will be submitted on Form NCUA 4001. (State-charteredcredit unions applying for conversion to Federal charter will use FormNCUA 4000. <T3>See </T3>Chapter 3 for a full discussion.) The organizer is requiredto certify the information and recommend approval or disapproval, basedon the investigation of the request. Instructions and guidance for completingthe form are provided on the form's reverse side. Associational charterapplicants must include a statement of their membership criteria (normallythe associations's constitution or bylaws) and the association's currentfinancial statement. 2. <T3>Report of Official and Agreement to Serve, NCUA 4012.</T3> This formdocuments general background information of each official of the proposedFederal credit union. Each official must complete and sign this form. Inaddition, NCUA will request credit and criminal investigations of new officials.3. <T3>Organization Certificate, NCUA 4008.</T3> This document establishesthe seven criteria required of subscribers by the Federal Credit UnionAct and is signed by the subscribers and notarized. This document shouldbe executed in duplicate. 4. <T3>Certification of Resolutions, NCUA 9501.</T3> This document certifiesthat the board of directors of the proposed Federal credit union has resolvedto apply for insurance of member accounts and has authorized the presidentand treasurer to execute the Application and Agreements for Insurance ofAccounts. This form must be signed by both the president and secretaryof the proposed Federal credit union. 5. <T3>Application and Agreements for Insurance of Accounts, NCUA 9500.</T3>This document contains the agreements with which Federal credit unionsmust comply in order to obtain National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund(NCUSIF) coverage of member accounts, including appropriate fidelity bondcoverage of officials. The document must be completed and signed by boththe president and treasurer. 6. <T3>Business Plan.</T3> While the required business plan need not followa prescribed form, it must include all of the information set forth inChapter 1. C. <T3>Submittal of Application. </T3>Applications for new charters shouldbe submitted to the Regional Director serving the state in which the proposedcredit union is headquartered. Applications for Federal credit union chartersshould include, at a minimum, the documentation discussed in section Babove. All charter applications are processed by the Regional Directorin accordance with NCUA procedures. The appropriate NCUA regional office will investigate all applicationsfor Federal credit union charters. The investigation will include on-sitecontacts by NCUA with proposed officials and others having an interestin the proposed new charter. Credit and background checks will be requestedfor the credit unions' proposed officials. NCUA will acknowledge receiptof the application and will estimate processing time. Every effort willbe made to act expeditiously on all applications.VIII. Letters of Understanding and Agreement NCUA has found from experience that certain activities generally causesignificant problems for new credit unions. Therefore, in most cases, NCUAwill require the prospective Federal credit union's officials to enterinto an agreement not to engage in certain activities. The agreement isfor a limited term_usually two to four years. A sample letter is attachedas Exhibit B of this Chapter.IX. Approvals NCUA will make every effort to process the application expeditiously. Onceapproved, the board of directors of the newly-formed Federal credit unionwill receive a signed charter and by-laws from the Regional Director. Inaddition, the officials will be advised of the name and mailing addressof the examiner who has been assigned responsibility for supervising andexamining the credit union. Generally, the examiner will contact the creditunion officials shortly after approval of the charter in order to arrangefor the initial examination (usually within the first six months of operation).Assistance in commencing operations is generally available through thevarious state credit union leagues.

To uphold the provisions of the Federal Credit Union Act concerningthe granting of Federal charters; B. To promote credit union safety and soundness; and C. To make quality credit union service available to all <T3>eligible groups </T3>who wish to have it. A Federal credit union's field of membership is an official statement whichspecifically defines who may become a member of the credit union. It isrecorded in section 5 of the credit union's charter. Any change to the field of membership, whether it is an addition, deletion,or simple update, must be reflected formally in section 5 of the creditunion's charter. Changes to section 5 are normally initiated by the officialsof the respective Federal credit union and submitted in writing to theappropriate NCUA Regional Office for approval.   The National Credit Union Administration Board has delegated the authorityto the Regional Directors to act on most charter amendment requests. Thisdelegation enables the Agency to respond to the majority of requests promptly.However, certain complex proposals require special investigation by theRegional Directors, and may also require consultation with other RegionalDirectors and the Agency's Central Office. Applicants submitting such complexproposals will be advised in writing of the need for special review andthe likelihood of extra processing time. Reasons for Requesting an Amendment A Federal credit union's board of directors may wish to request a fieldof membership amendment for a variety of reasons, including, but not limitedto:<ITAG tagnum="15">_Providing credit union access and service to an additional, clearly-definedgroup of persons who desire to be served by the applicant credit union;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Accommodating sponsor acquisitions or reorganization; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Diversifying the membership base in order to withstand real or potentialeconomic adversities (e.g., sponsor shutdown or cutback, economic downturn);</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Merger with another credit union; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Expanding the membership base to facilitate an improvement of serviceto all members. </ITAG>Field of Membership Addition Requests_Types and CriteriaFour types of charters exist (occupation, association, community, and multiplegroup) for purposes of establishing a Federal credit union. Field of membershipexpansions are achieved by adding groups (either occupational, associationalor community) to an existing credit union. The definition of common bond for purposes of field of membership additionsis the same as that found in the previous chapter concerning Federal creditunion chartering. The examples of groups which do and do not meet the definitionof common bond found in that chapter apply to field of membership additionsas well. Different criteria apply to occupational, associational and multiplegroup field of membership additions than apply to community field of membershipexpansions. These two sets of criteria are discussed below. Special rules apply for credit union additions to provide service to retireeand senior citizen groups. Additional methods of increasing the field ofmembership are possible through a merger or a purchase andamp; assumption.All of these types of expansions are discussed briefly below. Occupational and associational groups which share the same common bondas the credit union's primary sponsor fall under the category of commonbond additions. Occupational and associational groups which have a separatecommon bond from a Federal credit union's primary sponsor (common bondgroup) are added under the provisions of select group field of membershipexpansion policy. Select group and common bond expansions are treated somewhatdifferently. Additions Within the Common Bond Some field of membership expansions for occupational and associationaltype Federal credit unions can be accomplished along traditional commonbond lines. For example, an FCU whose primary sponsor is a particular corporationmay add by a charter amendment: the employees of that corporation who workat another location; employees of the corporation who are paid from orare supervised from the headquarters location, such as sales persons orsales agents who work at a number of locations; employees of a divisionor majority-owned subsidiary of the parent corporation regardless of locationor employees of a related company, such as a company under contract andpossessing a strong dependency relationship on the sponsoring corporation.  The written request for an addition must be supported by a letter froman authoritative representative of the organization to be added. This lettershould indicate:(1) That the group wants to affiliate with the applicant Federal creditunion;(2) That at present the group does not have the availability of a creditunion; and(3) The number of persons currently employed by the corporate unit.Whenever possible, this letter should be submitted on the letterhead stationeryof the respective corporate entity. Included with the request for expansionmust be a current financial statement for the applicant Federal creditunion.For associational Federal credit unions, expansions along common bond lineswill normally be allowed only at the lowest economically feasible organizationallevel of the sponsoring association. For example, a Federal credit unionserving the members of a local chapter of an association could apply toserve the members of another chapter.The approval or disapproval of a field of membership amendment requestof an existing FCU adding an association which crosses NCUA regional boundariesmay be subject to special review, and this may cause some delay in processing.The Regional Director whose jurisdiction includes the applicant creditunion will notify the applicant of the special review and will advise theapplicant in writing of the estimated time frame needed to reach a decision.Unlike select group additions, common bond additions do not have operationalarea requirements. That is, an addition within the common bond may be approvedeven though the applicant FCU does not have an office in the vicinity ofthe group to be added.Select Group AdditionsA select group of persons seeking credit union service from an occupational,associational or multiple group Federal credit union must have its owncommon bond. The select groups themselves may be either employee (occupational)groups or associational groups. However, a select group for expansion purposescannot be defined by a common bond of community. The group's common bondneed not be similar to the common bond(s) of the existing Federal creditunion. In addition to the group having its own common bond, the followingfive criteria must be satisfied before an addition request will be approved.a. All affected groups have requested service from the applicant FCU.b. The applicant FCU possesses the financial resources and management capabilityto provide quality credit union service to each group. The applicant creditunion's current CAMEL rating and financial condition will be consideredunder this criterion.c. The addition request is economically feasible and advisable.d. The applicant obtains a written statement from each group indicatingwhether the group is currently eligible for membership or is being servedby any other credit union. If the groups are eligible for membership inanother credit union, justification must be provided to show that the groupsno longer desire that eligibility for continued service. The applicantcredit union must provide a written statement from any overlapped creditunion concurring or objecting to the overlap.e. The group must be within the operational area of the home or a branchoffice of the FCU. Operational area is defined as an area surrounding thehome or branch office that can reasonably be served by the applicant asdetermined by NCUA. Although a new select group alone is not enough tojustify a proposed branch office, it is permissible to include new groupsas partial justification for a proposed branch office if that office willalso improve credit union service to the existing field of membership.However, the current field of membership must comprise a significant portionof the total field of membership to be served initially by the proposedbranch office. A branch office means any office of a Federal credit unionwhere an employee accepts payment on shares and disburses loans. An ATM,or similar cash disbursing machine, does not qualify as a branch officefor purposes of field of membership expansion.The process to add a select group to a Federal credit union's field ofmembership is a relatively simple one. A Federal credit union must submita formal written request for the expansion to the appropriate RegionalOffice of NCUA. The request should be signed by the credit union's presidentor chairman of the board of directors. Accompanying the correspondencefrom the requesting credit union should be (1) a letter signed by an authoritativerepresentative of each select group to be added and (2) a current financialstatement for the requesting credit union. The letter from the select groupshould indicate at least the following:1. The number of employees or members in the select group;2. Whether the group currently has access to another credit union (if itdoes, then the other credit union should be specifically identified. Aletter from the overlapped credit union should be obtained stating itsconcurrence or objection. If objections are raised, then the overlappedcredit union is required to furnish the number of persons from the selectgroup who are enrolled as members.);3. That the select group is interested in obtaining service from the requestingcredit union and that the group will support the credit union by such meansas providing access to its employees or members via payroll deduction,use of employee or member newsletters, etc., and4. The proximity to the applicant credit union's closest office.Credit unions using the select group addition alternative should obtainthe supporting letter from the group on the select group's letterhead stationery.The letterhead will enable NCUA to correctly identify the proper titleof the select group and will provide validation of the select group's location(to ensure that the operational area requirement is satisfied). It is possible for a Federal credit union to serve the employees or membersof a select group who are located outside the operating area of the creditunion as long as the select group has its headquarters (or its ``paid from'')location within the credit union's operating area, or a majority of thecompany's employees work within the credit union's operational area. However,special care will be exercised by the Regional Directors in consideringrequests for select associational group expansions where the association'smembership is geographically dispersed. The associational chartering policycriteria discussed in Chapter 1 including Chapter 1, IV_Widely DispersedAssociational Charters, will apply in its entirety to select associationalgroup expansion requests. Community FCU Field of Membership Expansions Community Federal credit union's may expand their fields of membershiponly by redefining the boundaries of their service area. Community charterpolicy stipulates that there be regular contact among persons who liveor work within a well-defined neighborhood, community or rural districtin order to satisfy the common bond requirements of the Federal CreditUnion Act. The burden of proof for existence of the common bond is placedupon the applicant credit union. An existing community Federal credit union may submit a request to expandits area of service by changing the boundaries which define its communityfield of membership. The enlarged area must constitute a geographical areathat could be established as a community credit union under NCUA policy.Also, an existing occupational, associational or multiple group type Federalcredit union may apply to convert to a community charter. In order to supporta case for such an expansion, the applicant Federal Credit Union must submita map or maps showing both the existing and proposed boundaries for thefield of membership. The most current population figures for the two areasmust be obtained and included in the package. The source of the populationinformation must be recorded in the credit union's request. Evidence inthe form of surveys or letters from authoritative representatives of prominentgroups located in the area to be added must be furnished to show that theresidents of the area are interested in affiliating with the applicantcredit union. Information concerning the availability of financial servicesto the residents of the new area must be supplied. Especially importantis whether other credit union service is currently available. If presentcredit union service to the residents of the new area is adequate, theremay be no basis for the proposed expansion. In addition, depending upon the significance of the potential membershipincrease, the Regional Director may require formulation of a business planto show how the residents of the new area are to be served and whetherthe costs of this proposed service can be afforded by the applicant creditunion. Whether or not a formal business plan is required, the applicantFCU must submit current financial statements with its proposal. Finally, in the majority of cases where community credit unions are askingto expand their areas of service and in all cases where a conversion toa community charter is proposed, an NCUA examiner will make an on-siteevaluation of the proposal. The examiner will prepare a separate analysisof the proposed expansion independent of the credit union's application.Following completion of the on-site evaluation and Regional Office reviewof the examiner's report, the Regional Director will act on the proposal,provided that the size of the proposed area's population does not exceedhis delegated authority. If so, the applicant credit union will be formallyapprised of the need for NCUA Board consideration. Addition of Retiree or Senior Citizen Associations Special rules apply for retiree or senior citizen groups that seek creditunion service. For field of membership addition purposes, these groupsare viewed as unique associational groups which do not need to meet allthe requirements for associations discussed in Chapter 1. It is NCUA Boardpolicy to make FCU service available to as many senior citizens and retireesas possible who are in fact interested in obtaining access to a creditunion. Federal credit unions are encouraged to bring associations of seniorcitizens or retired persons within their fields of membership, and to sponsorand assist in the formation of such associations where they do not exist.The policies recited in Chapter 1 for associational groups (requiring thatthe sponsoring association be well-established and that it not be an organizationcreated solely as a vehicle to obtain credit union service) do not applyto retiree or senior citizen associations. Such groups may be formed withthe primary purpose of providing eligibility for FCU service to the associationsand their members. The definitions of senior citizen or retiree are leftto each organization. The operational area criterion does apply to seniorcitizen and retiree organizations. Additions Via Mergers and Purchase and Assumptions A Federal credit union may obtain the entire field of membership of anothercredit union through a merger. In general, for mergers where the continuingcredit union is federally chartered, the field of membership criteria stipulatedin this and the preceding chapter are applicable. The criteria do not applyin the case of emergency mergers. The following discussion pertains to a continuing credit union that isfederally chartered. Most mergers fall into one of two fields of membershipcategories. The mergers are feasible either because the two credit unionshad common sponsors (like common bonds) or were located in the same operationalarea (multiple group). Two credit unions serving the employees of the samecorporation may merge without regard to the locations of the credit unions'offices. Similarly, two credit unions serving members of the same associationmay merge even though the two are not located in the same operational area.However, two credit unions with unlike fields of membership may only mergewhen they are located in the same operational area. Any combination ofassociational, multiple group, and occupational is permissible as longas the operational area requirement is satified. Mergers of any of thesethree types of field of membership into a community charter are permissibleas long as the merging credit union is located within the community creditunion's service area. The resulting field of membership remains a communitycharter.  Mergers of community credit unions into a Federal credit union of any typemay be accomplished where the operational area requirement is satifiedand the continuing Federal credit union is not interested in obtainingthe field of membership of the merging community charter. The continuingFederal credit union will only obtain the members of record of the mergingcredit union. Where both credit unions are community charters and the criteriafor expanding the service area of a community credit union (as discussedpreviously in this chapter) are satisfied, the entire field of membershipof the merging credit union will be added to the continuing Federal creditunion's charter.  Regardless of the type of credit union involved where the merging creditunion is suffering such severe financial difficulties that it will becomeinsolvent within six months, it may merge into any Federal credit unionin the same operational area. If the merging credit union is communitybased, its field of membership will be transferred intact to the continuingFederal credit union. In this case, the continuing Federal credit unionwill remain as an occupational, associational, multiple group, or communitycharter for purposes of future field of membership expansions.  Finally, a specifically designated emergency merger may be approved bythe NCUA Board without regard to field of membership or other legal constraints.An emergency merger involves NCUA's direct intervention. The credit unionto be merged must either be insolvent or in danger of insolvency <T3>and</T3> the NCUA Board must determine that:  A. An emergency requiring expeditious action exists;  B. Other alternatives are not reasonably available; and  C. The public interest would best be served by approving the merger.  In an emergency merger situation, NCUA takes an active role in findinga suitable merger partner (continuing credit union). NCUA is primarilyconcerned that the continuing credit union has the financial strength andmanagement expertise to absorb the troubled credit union without adverselyaffecting its own financial condition and stability. As a stipulated conditionto an emergency merger, the field of membership of the merging credit unionmay be transferred intact to the continuing credit union.  Another alternative for acquiring the field of membership of a failingcredit union is through consolidation known as purchase and assumption.A purchase and assumption has limited application because the failing creditunion must be placed into involuntary liquidation. However, in the fewinstances where purchase and assumption may occur, the assuming Federalcredit union may acquire the entire field of membership along with loans,shares and certain designated assets and liabilities, without regard tofield of membership expansion restrictions and without changing the characterof the credit union for purposes of future field of membership expansions. Spin-Offs  A ``spin-off'' is, in effect, a partial merger. By agreement of the parties,a portion of the field of membership of a credit union, along with assets,liabilities, and capital, is transferred to a new or existing credit union.If the spin-off goes to a new Federal charter, the requirements of Chapter1 apply. If it goes to an existing Federal charter, the requirements ofChapter 2 apply. Prior to completion, NCUA must approve all spin-offs inwhich a Federal credit union is involved.  Overlaps_See Chapter 1 for discussion.  Exclusionary Clauses_See Chapter 1 for discussion.  <ITAG tagnum="81">Reviewing Field of Membership Addition Requests</ITAG>All field of membership requests will be reviewed by Regional Office staffin order to ensure that the requests conform to NCUA policy, are properlydocumented and do not cause significantly harmful or unreasonable overlapwith the fields of membership of existing credit unions. NCUA understandsand appreciates the importance of timely processing of well-supported additionrequests. To respond to this desire for prompt handling, each RegionalOffice has established a goal of ten working days from the date of receiptin the Regional Office for complete processing of a routine addition request.A fully documented request that fulfills all of the criteria discussedin this manual and does not require written or telephone follow-up willnormally be processed within this time.In some cases, an on-site review by NCUA examiner staff may be requestedby the Regional Director before acting on a proposed addition. Nonstandardor controversial requests, those involving associational, community ormultiple charters, or those from credit unions with serious operationalor management problems, are most likely to fall into this category. Inaddition, as stated in the earlier discussion in this chapter under communitycharter expansions, the Regional Director may, at his discretion, aftertaking into account the significance of the field of membership expansionproposed, require the applicant to submit a business plan.The condition of the requesting credit union will be considered in everyinstance. The economic feasibility of expanding the field of membershipof a credit union with serious management or operational problems mustbe carefully considered by regional staff if the safety and soundness ofthe credit union is to be preserved. In most cases, field of membershipadditions will only be approved for credit unions which are operating satisfactorily.If a Federal credit union is having difficulty providing good service toits current membership, it may have even more difficulty serving an enlargedfield of membership. In some cases, expanding the field of membership ofa struggling credit union may do more harm than good. A struggling creditunion's resources need to be focused on current problems. Placing an additionalstrain on these resources by increasing the field of membership may alsoincrease the credit union's problems.If the requested addition is approved by the Regional Director, the creditunion will be furnished a formal, updated section 5 of its charter whichrestates the entire field of membership, including the requested addition.After action by the board of directors, the form should be promptly filedwith the credit union's official charter and bylaws.If the request is denied by the Regional Director, the credit union willbe so advised in writing and furnished specific reasons for the denial.This correspondence may include suggestions and other options for the creditunion's consideration. This letter will also include information aboutthe availability of the appeals process. If a credit union's request isdisapproved by the Regional Director, the credit union may appeal the decision(or request a review of the policy involved) to the NCUA Board throughthe appropriate Regional Director.Service Status ReportsFederal credit unions which frequently add select groups to their fieldsof membership should be prepared to furnish a written summary of the resultsof their efforts to bring service to the employees or members of the selectgroups. The Regional Offices will request periodically that such FCU'ssubmit service status reports to NCUA showing, at a minimum, the numberof primary potential members of each select group added and the numberof persons from each select group who have actually enrolled as creditunion members. These service status reports can be enlarged to requireinformation concerning aggregate share and loan activity by select groupor participation in other credit union services. In any event, Federalcredit unions using the select group addition method should implement aninformation gathering system early in their addition/diversification programto track their progress in bringing service to the potential members oftheir select groups.This information will help the credit union to operate efficiently andwill give management the data necessary to make decisions about marketingstrategy, new promotions, implementation of new services, etc. The servicestatus reports will enable NCUA to determine which Federal credit unionsare serving newly-added groups, as well as any Federal credit unions thatare not serving new groups. If the NCUA determines that a Federal creditunion is not adequately serving new groups, the Regional Director may removethe select group(s) not being served from Section 5 of the credit unioncharter.<ITAG tagnum="84">Chapter 3_Charter Conversions</ITAG>A charter conversion is a change in the jurisdictional authority underwhich a credit union operates. A credit union's charter is the instrumentgiven to the institution by the government, either state or Federal, grantingto it the authority to carry out credit union business in accordance withlaw.Federal credit unions receive their charters from NCUA and are subjectto its supervision, examination, and regulation; they are incorporatedunder Federal law. State-chartered credit unions are incorporated in aparticular state, receiving their charter from the state agency responsiblefor credit unions and subject to the state's supervisory authority. Ifthe state-chartered credit union is federally insured by NCUA, it willalso fall under NCUA's jurisdiction.A Federal credit union's power and authority are principally derived fromthe Federal Credit Union Act and NCUA Rules and Regulations. State-charterdcredit unions are principally governed by state law and regulation.There are two types of charter conversions: Federal charter to state charter,and state charter to Federal charter. Although common bond is not an issuefrom NCUA's standpoint in the case of a Federal to state charter conversion,the procedures and forms relevant to such a conversion have been included.<ITAG tagnum="85">I_Conversion of a State Credit Union to a Federal Credit Union</ITAG>A.General RequirementsAny state-chartered credit union may apply to convert to a Federal creditunion. In order to convert, it must:1. Comply with state law regarding conversion;2. File proof of compliance with NCUA;3. File the required preliminary documents with NCUA;4. Upon NCUA's approval of the preliminary documents file a proposed Federalcredit union organization certificate;5. Comply with the requirements of the Federal Credit union Act, e.g.,common bond and reserve requirements; and6. Be granted a charter by NCUA.Conversions are treated the same as any initial application for a Federalcharter, including mandatory on-site examination by NCUA. NCUA will alsoconsult with the appropriate state authority regarding the credit union'scurrent condition, management expertise, and past performance. Since theapplicant in a conversion is an ongoing credit union, the economic advisabilityof granting a charter is more readily determinable than in the case ofan initial charter application.A converting state credit union's proposed field of membership must conformto NCUA chartering policy. However, existing members who would not be withinthe revised field of membership will be allowed to retain their membershipafter the conversion.B. Submission of Conversion Proposal to NCUAThe following actions are to be taken before submitting a conversion proposal:1. The credit union board must approve a proposal for conversion.2.
