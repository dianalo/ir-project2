 The company is slated to announce at Uniforumthis week a color X terminal priced at $ 5,000.andM;In a separate announcement, NCD has released software called XRemote thatlets NCD's X window network display stations communicate serial lines.andM;The color X terminal, called the NCD17c, is based on Motorola's 20MHz 68020microprocessor and a pair of custom graphics chips.andP;  It has a 17-inch flatcolor screen.andM;TCP/IP and DECnet are available as options for the terminal.andP;  Dual protocolsupport will allow users to access applications simultaneously from networkedhosts running Unix, Ultrix and VMS.andM;According to industry analysts, NCD is releasing a solid, low-priced productinto a market that is very ready for the product's capabilities.andM;&quot;The X window displays are here to stay.andP;  There's no question they will playa major role in distributed network computing in the future,&quot; said GregBlatnik, a vice president at San Jose, Calif., market research companyDataquest.andM;Blatnik called the terminal &quot;a very impressive product.andP;  It seems to havevery quick responsiveness and performance.andP;  The colors seem to be very crispand sharp.&quot;andM;&quot;Users will have a decision to make--[an] intelligent processor on their deskor [a] full-color X terminal.andP;  Given the entry-level price [compared withdesktop systems], we believe users will go for the X terminal solution,&quot; saidJohn Dunkle, vice president of Workgroup Technologies, a Hampton, N.H.-basedmarket research company.andM;X window terminals also offer distinct network management benefits, givingusers access to graphics applications without forcing system managers tomonitor and back up a large number of CPUs across a LAN.andM;NCD's offering may encourage major vendors to step up their color X terminalefforts, Dunkle added.andP;  &quot;Given the entry-level price and the capability, manyof the entry-level competitors, i.e., DEC and IBM and even SUN, are going tobe scrambling for their color X terminal solutions in the near term, &quot;hesaid.andM;The terminal uses eight-bit planes to provide 256 simultaneous colors from apalette of 16.7 million.andM;The machine was designed for color from the ground up, according to JudyEstrin, executive vice president at NCD.andP;  &quot;We developed a set of custom ASICgraphics engines, and the software to drive those engines is optimized forcolor,&quot; she said.andM;The color terminal's $5,000 list price is only about $2,000 more than DECwill ask for its soon-to-ship monochrome X terminal, according to industrywatchers.andM;The difference in price &quot;between monochrome and color [products] ofequivalent characteristics is usually anywhere from 50 to 100 percent.andP;  Ifyou're using that as a benchmark, [NCD's price] is quite impressive,&quot;Dataquest's Blatnik said.andM;The NCD17c terminal comes with 2MB of memory that can be expanded to SMB.andO;The terminal's screen has a 70MHz non-interlaced refresh rate, 0.26mm dotpitch and a resolution of 75 dots per inch.andM;The terminal is compatible with software for NCD's two black-and-whiteterminals and uses a version of the X11 server software that has beenenhanced NCD.andP;  It supports Ethernet and thin-wire Ethernet.andM;Along with the terminal, NCD will announce a compact 97-key keyboard designedfor Unix.andP;  The Keyboard is about two-thirds the size of a standard PS/2keyboard, according to NCD officials.andM;Terminal buyers can choose the new keyboard, PS/2-style, DEC LK201-style or aKana keyboard.andM;Home, Remote UsesandM;NCD has also given all its X terminal users the ability to work at home or inremote locations using telephone lines and modems to communicate with a mainoffice.andM;&quot;XRemote mainly consists of a new protocol for our device that lets you run Xover serial lines instead of directly attached to an Ethernet connection,&quot;Estrin said.andM;XRemote can support the heavy bandwidth requirements of bit-mappedworkstations and windowing systems, she said.andM;&quot;We designed a new transport protocol that adds multilevel compression--itdoesn't compress just once--that allows you to have an X terminal away fromyour office and run text, graphics and multilayer applications,&quot; Estrin said.andM;The product also has built-in reliability mechanisms that enable XRemote totolerate noise, modem errors and other line problems, she said.andM;NCD officials claimed that XRemote has approximately 10 times the performanceof Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP), which is now generally used forserial communication on X terminal products.andM;XRemote allows serial and LAN communications from the X terminal, althoughthey can't be used concurrently.andM;XRemote will be available next month as part of a special PROM set thatcontains the XRemote protocol rather than TCP/IP, and all other standard NCDsoftware.andM;An XRemote-equipped unit can be connected to TCP/IP by rebooting from thenetwork rather than from PROM, NCD officials said.andM;A V.32 full-duplex 9600-baud or faster modem should be used with XRemote forremote serial applications, the officials added.andM;The NCD17c color X terminal will be available in March, Optical TCP/IPprotocol for the machine is priced at $50.andP;  Optional support for TCP/IP andDECnet protocols is priced at $150.andM;The Unix-style keyboard is available separately for $150.andM;The PROM set is priced at $300 per ncd unit plus one $500 cartridge tape forthe host computer.andM;Object code is available for Sun workstations and source code licenses arealso available for a nominal fee, according to officials.andM;To obtain additional information, Network Computing Devices Inc. can becontacted at 350 N.
