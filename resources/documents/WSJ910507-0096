The process involves propulsion of microscopic DNA-coatedparticles directly into plant and animal cells. The geneticmaterial introduced via the so-called &quot;gene gun&quot; combineswith existing DNA and can impart new traits.</LP><TEXT>   Du Pont said applications of the process include possibleproduction of disease-resistant or insect-resistant crops, orhigher-yielding plants, as well as potential biomedicalapplications.   The gene gun was developed in the late 1980s by CornellUniversity scientists, who formed a closely held company,Biolistics Inc.; Du Pont acquired rights to the technology in1989.   The system uses microscopic pellets of titanium, to whichtiny dabs of genetic material have been attached. Thegene-delivery system then fires millions of such particlesinto plant or animal tissue. Du Pont said the system &quot;hasbeen used successfully to introduce genes into corn,soybeans, mammalian tissues and microorganisms.&quot;   Bio-Rad, based in Hercules, Calif., makes researchproducts, diagnostic kits and anlaytical instruments. Underthe pact with Du Pont, it has the right to make instrumentsfor, &quot;and sell consumables resulting from,&quot; the deliverysystem.</TEXT></DOC>
