The unit of Swedish auto maker AB Volvo agreed to pay Ford Motor Co. $100 million for a 20% stake in Park Ridge Corp., the parent company of Hertz.    Ford owns 80% of Park Ridge and Hertz managers own the remaining 20%. Park Ridge, N.J.-based Park Ridge was formed last fall solely to buy Hertz from Allegis Corp. Allegis has since shed other non-airline businesses and now is known as UAL Inc.    Park Ridge paid about $1.3 billion for Hertz. Ford provided roughly $500 million of the purchase price; Park Ridge supplied the remainder through borrowings.    Ford Vice President and Controller David N. McCammon said Volvo will pay &quot;basically what we paid&quot; for the Park Ridge common and preferred stock it has agreed to acquire &quot;and we think that's fine.&quot; He said Ford's original interest in Hertz was &quot;defensive,&quot; to ensure Hertz &quot;wouldn't be bought by someone who would want to transfer its business.&quot; Ford vehicles make up a little more than half of Hertz's U.S. rental fleet.    Ford has also emphasized since the original purchase that it eventually hopes to cut its stake in Park Ridge to a minority position; yesterday's announcement of the Volvo agreement is a &quot;step in that direction,&quot; Mr. McCammon said.    Another Ford spokesman said the Dearborn, Mich.-based auto maker has &quot;had some discussions with other potential investors . . . but nothing's progressed far enough to make any predictions.&quot; The spokesman declined to say who the other potential investors are.    Bjorn Ahlstrom, president and chief executive officer of Volvo North America, said he wouldn't like &quot;to see another auto maker in this arrangement, but there will certainly be other minority shareholders over time, and I have no comments as to who that might be.&quot;    Volvo North America said it expects the purchase to be completed by the end of July. The terms include a &quot;supply agreement,&quot; the details of which are &quot;not to be disclosed,&quot; Mr. Ahlstrom said. But he added that he hopes Volvo representation with Hertz &quot;will substantially increase over the years. Of course, that's up to Hertz and Hertz customers.&quot;    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Ford closed up 37.5 cents at $53.875, on volume of 1.4 million shares. In over-the-counter trading, AB Volvo American depositary receipts closed unchanged at $56.50, on volume of 26,100.    A spokesman for Hertz declined to say how many of the rental-car firm's 400,000 rental and lease vehicles world-wide are Volvo models, but Mr. Ahlstrom estimated that there are about 2,000 Volvos in Hertz's U.S. rental fleet.    This is Volvo North America's second affiliation with a Big Three auto maker. It also has a 76% stake in Volvo-GM Heavy Truck Corp., which combines North American heavy-duty truck operations of Volvo and General Motors Corp.    In addition to the truck venture and a car-assembly operation in Canada, Volvo North America makes and sells marine and industrial engines. Its sales of $3.2 billion last year accounted for more than 25% of AB Volvo's world-wide product sales. </TEXT></DOC>
