A strike deadline wasn't set, but the current pact expires at 12:01 a.m. EDT June 23, putting workers in a legal position to walk out as early as next week.    The laborers, members of the Canadian Auto Workers union, voted 98% in favor of a strike, which would affect de Havilland's assembly plant at Downsview, Ontario.    The union said the negotiations -- the first to take place between it and de Havilland since the commuter aircraft maker was acquired by Boeing from the Canadian government in January 1986 -- have been proceeding slowly since they opened May 8. The union said it is &quot;disturbed&quot; by &quot;a long list of company take-away demands&quot; presented last week. It didn't elaborate.    Boeing's corporate director of labor relations, Larry McKean, said the Seattle-based aerospace and defense concern is seeking changes to work rules, job transfers and job descriptions at de Havilland like those negotiated at other aircraft manufacturers. Monetary issues have yet to be negotiated. Mr. McKean said the strike vote was expected.    De Havilland's 600 office workers, also members of the union, will take a similar vote tomorrow. Mr. McKean said a strike at de Havilland, which makes only Dash 8 commuter aircraft, would have no effect on Boeing's other operations. </TEXT></DOC>
