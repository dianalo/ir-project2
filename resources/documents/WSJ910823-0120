The inquiry, which focuses on whether the ailing bankdisregarded bourse regulations that call for listed companiesto report price-affecting information, was prompted bystatements made by Christiania's chairman, Per DitlevSimonsen, at a press conference earlier in the week,according to Bernt Bangstab, an official at the bourse.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Simonsen, who was appointed chairman this year,expressed criticism of the bank's board, and according to Mr.Bangstab, said the bank may have failed to discloseinformation regarding its credit losses.   &quot;If this is true, the bank has disregarded its obligationto supply the market with information and has, in effect,violated bourse regulations,&quot; Mr. Bangstab said.   The inquiry also aims to determine whether the bank'sconduct could have led to insider trading by three Norwegiancompanies -- oil groups Norsk Hydro AS and Statoil AS andinsurance group Uni Storebrand AS.   This week, the Stock Exchange forced Christiania Bank torelease its second-quarter earnings report three days aheadof schedule. &quot;Because of the heavy speculation around thereport, we told Christiania that we would suspend trading inthe group's shares unless it released its report,&quot; Mr.Bangstab said.   Christiania reported a second-quarter net loss of 1.36billion kroner ($200.3 million), compared with a net loss of132 million kroner a year earlier. It said actual andestimated loan losses of 1.29 billion kroner were charged offduring the quarter, compared with 571 million kroner a yearearlier.   The three Norwegian companies agreed in June to supportthe banking group by acting as underwriters for a plannedshare issue. But last Wednesday, five days before the reportwas released, the three companies pulled out. That led tosuspicion that the banking group had provided them withinformation about the earnings report, according to the stockexchange.   While the inquiry will consider insider trading, Mr.Bangstab stressed that wasn't its main focus. &quot;One has toassume that they had seen the report prior to Monday,&quot; Mr.Bangstab said. &quot;But it is a wholly other matter whether anyof the three companies actually traded using thisinformation.&quot;   Christiania denied the allegations. &quot;We have nothing tohide,&quot; a spokesman said, but he wouldn't comment furtheruntil the investigation had been completed.</TEXT></DOC>
