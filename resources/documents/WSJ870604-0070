That gloomy dilemma, he said, had arisen because private foreign investors were no longer willing to invest in U.S. assets and finance the large current-account trade deficits.    But yesterday, Mr. Greenspan was more optimistic. He said that after examining the data, he had concluded that foreign investors had been frightened earlier this year by fears that the U.S. would enact protectionist measures and, eventually, controls on capital. And new information suggests those fears may now have eased.    &quot;That episode apparently came to an end a couple of weeks ago,&quot; said Mr. Greenspan.    Fed officials contend that monetary policy has been exceedingly difficult this year because of foreign investors' fickleness and the dollar's weakness. The Fed has felt compelled to nudge up interest rates to keep the dollar from falling too rapidly, even though weakness in the economy argued against higher interest rates.    If Mr. Greenspan's analysis is correct, however, the rise in interest rates may now be over. The Fed may be able to keep the dollar from falling without pushing rates up further.    To support his view that the dollar has bottomed out, Mr. Greenspan cited new Fed data showing that foreign central bank holdings of U.S. securities dropped sharply in the week ended May 27. The decline suggests that private foreign investors are now buying U.S. securities, making intervention by governments unnecessary.    Mr. Greenspan also noted that the interest paid on U.S. Treasury bonds is now more than five percentage points higher than that paid on comparable Japanese securities. That should be enough, he argued, to keep foreigners interested in investing in U.S. assets. &quot;The range has become so wide as to make dollar investments sufficiently attractive, relative to yen securities, that stability in the dollar should not be too difficult to achieve,&quot; he said.    Like the departing chairman, Paul Volcker, Mr. Greenspan has a reputation as a tough inflation fighter. But if his analysis of the current market situation is correct, his willingness to take tough anti-inflation measures may not be put to the test soon.    Many other analysts, however, argue that the new Fed chief won't be so lucky. They believe the dollar may drop to 120 yen or below before it stabilizes. </TEXT></DOC>
