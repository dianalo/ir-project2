The heir to the British throne said people around the world arelooking to their leaders to take bold decisions to save theenvironment ``and not to put off those critical decisions that willultimately cause our grandchildren to curse us.''   He welcomed decisions by the United States and the EuropeanEconomic Community to try to ban chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, bythe end of the century but said ``I fear even that will be 10 yearstoo late.''   Earlier Monday, the Soviet Union said it needed more scientificevidence that CFCs destroy the ozone layer before it would agree tospeed up its phaseout of such chemicals.   ``We think that any decisions taken ... should be well-groundedand should have a firm scientific basis,'' said Vladimir Zhakarov,head of the Soviet delegation at a 120-nation conference on theozone layer.   ``If we take a decision which is not well-grounded we caninterfere and destroy the economies of the eveloping countries,'' hesaid.   Sherwood Rowland, an atmospheric chemist from the University ofCalifornia at Irvine, said, ``They (the Soviets) sound very muchlike people from the European Community a year ago and from theUnited States two years ago'' before they became aware of theproblem.   Most Western scientists agree that chlorofluorocarbons, commonlyused in refrigerators, aerosols and fast-food packaging, aregradually depleting the ozone shield that protects the Earth fromthe sun's cancer-causing ultraviolet rays.   The compounds also trap heat, warming the Earth's surface andcausing potentially major climate changes, a process known as the``Greenhouse Effect.''   Scientific expeditions to the Antarctic have pinpointed thecompounds as the cause of an ozone hole about the size of thecontinental United States.   Preliminary Soviet data suggests an ozone depletion of about 25percent over parts of Europe and as far into the Soviet Union asSiberia, said Zhakarov, chairman of the Soviet committee on ozoneprotection.   The Soviet delegation could not provide a map showing theboundaries of this area, which it said was caused by cyclones, notthe compounds. Zhakarov said the area could not be described as anozone hole.   The Soviet Union is among the 31 nations that have signed the1987 Montreal Protocol agreeing to halve the compounds by 1999.   The United States and the 12-nation European Economic Communityhave said they will try for a total ban by that time.   ``If there is proved scientific data that we should phase outthese substances, we will support this idea,'' Zhakarov said. ``Wedon't have such proof yet.''   However, Zhakarov's interpreter said the Soviet delegatepersonally favors quicker action.   The Soviet Union now produces 130,000 tons of the compounds ayear, he said, about 10 percent of total world production.   His country remains committed to halving that by 1999, Zhakarovsaid, acknowledging ``it will cost a lot of money.''   Liz Cook, ozone campaign chairman for the Friends of theEarth-USA environmental group, said the Soviets were trying to ``buythemselves a little time before they have to commit to a policy. ...The science is clearly there. ... It's not certain to me how theydon't have a clear picture when the rest of the world seems to bequite convinced that we need to go for a phase-out.''   Both China and India called for the industrialized countries,which use the vast majority of the compounds, to establish a fund tohelp developing nations acquire the technology to replace thecompounds.   Z.R. Ansari, India's environment minister, said the fund shouldnot cut into aid to fight poverty.   ``Any reduction in these resources for whatever reason would meanthat the poor of these countries will have to wait longer for thepromised freedom from hunger and poverty,'' he said. ``Today, thepoor are no more prepared to wait and there will be social upheavalif they are asked to wait any longer.''</TEXT></DOC>
