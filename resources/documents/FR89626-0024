Section 103 and the Department's regulations thereunder(29 CFR 2520.103-1 et seq.) describe the content of the annual report.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Section 502(c)(2) was added to ERISA by section 9342(c)(2)of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (OBRA 1987, Pub. L. 100-203).Section 502(c)(2) also provides that an annual report that has been rejectedunder section 104(a)(4) for failure to provide material information shallnot be treated as having been filed with the Secretary. ERISA section 104(a)(4)provides, in relevant part, that the Secretary may reject any filing upondetermining that such filing is incomplete. Section 104(a)(5) describesvarious remedies available to the Secretary where a filing is rejectedand a revised filing satisfactory to the Secretary is not submitted within45 days.\2\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Under section 104(a)(5), the Secretary may, in additionto engaging an independent qualified public accountant or an enrolled actuary,bring a civil action for appropriate legal or equitable relief or takeany other action authorized by Title I of ERISA, e.g., the assessment ofa civil penalty under section 502(c)(2). On October 17, 1988, the Department published a notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (53 FR 40677) containing proposed regulationsandSection; 2570.60 et seq. describing procedures relating to hearings beforean administrative law judge, and appeals, on assessment of penalties underERISA section 502(c)(2). On the same date, the Department also publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (53 FR 40674) a proposed regulation (andSection;2560.502c-2(a) et seq.) describing the manner in which the Department willassess civil penalties under ERISA section 502(c)(2) and certain proceduresfor agency review. As discussed in the supplementary information accompanyingthat publication, the Department believes that the section 502(c)(2) sanctionis a valuable additional enforcement tool which is necessary to ensurecompliance with ERISA's annual reporting requirements. In this regard,the adoption of these regulations (andSection; 2570.60 et seq.) are necessaryfor the effective implementation of its annual reporting enforcement program.\3\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Section 9342(d)(2) of OBRA 1987 provides that the Secretaryshall issue regulations necessary to carry out the 502(c)(2) civil penaltyprovisions. The Department received no comment in response to its October 17, 1988solicitation of comments on proposed regulations andSection; 2570.60 et seq.Therefore, except for two minor clarifications discussed below, the finalrules contained herein are being adopted as proposed. As noted in the supplementary information accompanying the proposed regulations,the Department has published rules of practice and procedure for administrativehearings before the Office of Administrative Law Judges at 29 CFR Part18, 48 FR 32538 (1983). The proposed regulations presented for commentseveral modifications to the rules set forth in 29 CFR Part 18. The proposedmodifications were designed to maintain the maximum degree of uniformitywith the rules set forth in 29 CFR Part 18, consistent with the rules setforth in 29 CFR Part 18, consistent with the special characteristics ofproceedings under ERISA section 502(c)(2). The final rules published hereinrelate specifically to proceedings under ERISA section 502(c)(2) and arecontrolling to the extent they are inconsistent with any portion of 29CFR Part 18. The following discussion summarizes the specific modifications to the rulesin 29 CFR Part 18 being adopted in the final rules contained in this noticeand the clarifying changes made to the proposed regulations. <ITAG tagnum="84">General </ITAG>The applicability of the procedural rules of 29 CFR Part 18 under section502(c)(2) is set forth in andSection; 2570.60. In this regard, it shouldbe noted that the procedural rules contained herein apply only to adjudicatoryproceedings before ALJs of the U.S. Department of Labor. Regulation andSection;2560.502c-2, also being published today, sets forth the procedures relatingto issuance by the Department of notices of intent to assess a penaltyunder ERISA section 502(c)(2), as well as procedures for agency reviewof statements of reasonable cause filed by persons against whom a penaltyis assessed. Under the procedural rules contained in this regulation, anadjudicatory proceeding before an ALJ is commenced only when a person againstwhom the Department intends to assess a penalty under section 502(c)(2)files an answer to a notice of the agency's determination on a statementof reasonable cause. <T3>See:</T3> andSection; 2570.61(c) and (d) below, and regulation andSection;2560.502c-2(h). The definitional section (andSection; 2570.61) incorporates the basic adjudicatoryprinciples set forth at 29 CFR Part 18, but includes terms and conceptsof specific relevance to proceedings under ERISA section 502(c)(2). Inthis respect it differs from its more general counterpart at andSection;18.2 of this title. Section 2570.61 states that the term ``Secretary''means the Secretary of Labor and includes various individuals to whom theSecretary may delegate authority. This definition is not intended to suggestany limitation on the authority which the Secretary has delegated to theAssistant Secretary for Pension and Welfare Benefits. By Order 1-87, 52FR 13139 (April 21, 1987), the Secretary has delegated most of his authorityto make final decisions to assess the penalty provided under section 502(c)(2)to the Assistant Secretary for Pension and Welfare Benefits. Thus, theDepartment contemplates that the duties assigned to the Secretary underthe procedural regulation will in fact be discharged by the Assistant Secretaryfor Pension and Welfare Benefits. The definitions set forth in andSection; 2570.61 are being adopted as proposed,except that the definition of ``pleading'', at paragraph (m), has beenmodified to clarify that the notice referred to therein is the notice describedin 29 CFR 2560.502c-2(g), i.e., the notice of a determination by the Departmenton an administrator's statement of reasonable cause. This clarificationis intended to remove any ambiguities as to which notice constitutes apart of the pleading in an adjudicatory proceeding before an ALJ. <ITAG tagnum="84">Proceedings Before Administrative Law Judges </ITAG>In general, the burden to initiate adjudicatory proceedings before an ALJwill be on the party against whom the Department is seeking to assess acivil penalty under ERISA section 502(c)(2) (the respondent). However,a respondent must comply with the procedures relating to agency reviewset forth in regulation andSection; 2560.502c-2 before initiating adjudicatoryproceedings. In this regard, it should be noted that both the notice ofintent to assess a penalty, as described in regulation andSection; 2560.502c-2(c),and the notice of determination on a statement of reasonable cause, asdescribed in regulation andSection; 2560.502c-2(g), will be issued by PWBA,the agency responsible for administration and enforcement of section 502(c)(2),in accordance with the service of notice provisions described in andSection;2560.502c-2(i). Regulation andSection; 2570.61 (c) and (d), together withregulation andSection; 2560.502c-2(h), contemplate that adjudicatory proceedingswill be initiated with the filing by a respondent of an answer to a noticeof the agency's determination on a statement of reasonable cause describedin andSection; 2560.502c-2(g). The service of documents by the parties to an adjudicatory proceeding,as well as by the ALJ, will be governed by regulation andSection; 2570.62.Section 2570.62(c), regarding service of documents by an ALJ, has beencorrected in the final regulation to delete the reference to ``notices''.Notices, for purposes of proceedings under ERISA section 502(c)(2), areissued only pursuant to subsections (c) and (g) andSection; 2560.502c-2,not by an ALJ. The provisions governing service of notices are set forthin andSection; 2560.502-2(i). Section 2570.64 of the final regulations describes the consequences ofdefault. That section provides that, if the respondent fails to file ananswer to the Department's notice of determination, described in andSection;2560.502c-2(g),within the 30-day period provided by andSection; 2560.502c-2(h), such failureshall be deemed to constitute a waiver of the right to appear and contestthe facts alleged in the notice and an admission of the facts alleged inthe notice for purposes of any proceeding involving the assessment of acivil penalty under section 502(c)(2). Regulation andSection; 2570.64 makesclear that, in the event of such a failure, the assessment of the penaltybecomes final. Section 2570.65 provides with respect to consent orders or settlementsthat the ALJ's decision shall include the terms and conditions of any consentorder or settlement which has been agreed to by the parties. That sectionalso provides that the decision of the ALJ which incorporates such consentorder shall become final agency action within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 704.The rules in 29 CFR Part 18 concerning the computation of time, pleadings,prehearing conferences and statements, and settlements, are adopted inthese procedures for adjudications under ERISA section 502(c)(2). The sectionon the designation of parties (andSection; 2570.63) differs from its counterpartunder andSection; 18.10 of this title in that it specifies that the respondentin these proceedings will, as indicated above, be the party against whomthe Department seeks to assess a civil penalty under ERISA section 502(c)(2).Section 2570.66 states that discovery may be ordered by the ALJ only upona showing of good cause by the party seeking discovery. This differs fromthe more liberal standard for discovery contained in 29 CFR 18.14. In casesin which discovery is ordered by the ALJ, the order shall expressly limitthe scope and terms of discovery to that for which good cause has beenshown. To the extent that the order of the ALJ does not specify rules forthe conduct of the discovery permitted by such order, the rules governingthe conduct of discovery from 29 CFR Part 18 are to be applied in theseproceedings under section 502(c)(2). For example, if the order of the ALJstates only that interrogatories on certain subjects may be permitted,the rules under 29 CFR Part 18 concerning the service and answering ofsuch interrogatories shall apply. The procedures under 29 CFR Part 18 forthe submission of facts to the ALJ during the hearing are also to be appliedin proceedings under ERISA section 502(c)(2).  The section on summary decisions (andSection;2570.67) provides the requisiteauthorization for an ALJ to issue a summary decision which may become finalwhen there are no genuine issues of material fact in a case arising underERISA section 502(c)(2). The section concerning the decision of the ALJ(andSection;2570.68) differs from its counterpart at andSection;18.57 of thistitle in that it states that the decision of the ALJ in section 502(c)(2)case shall become the final decision of the Secretary unless a timely appealis filed.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Appeals  </ITAG>The procedures for appeals of ALJ decisions under ERISA section 502(c)(2)are governed solely by the rules set forth in andSection;andSection;2570.69through 2570.71, and without any reference to the appellate procedurescontained in 29 CFR Part 18. Regulation andSection;2570.69 establishes thetime limit within which such appeals must be filed, the manner in whichthe issues for appeal are determined, and the procedures for making theentire record before the ALJ available to the Secretary. Regulation andSection;2570.70provides that review of the Secretary shall not be on a de novo basis,but rather on the basis of the record before the ALJ, and without an opportunityfor oral argument. Regulation andSection;2570.71 sets forth the procedurefor establishing a briefing schedule for such appeals, and states thatthe decision of the Secretary on such an appeal shall be final agency actionwithin the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 704. As noted above, the authority of theSecretary with respect to the appellate procedures has been delegated toan Assistant Secretary for Pension and Welfare Benefits. As required bythe Administrative Procedures Act (5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2)(A)) all final decisionsof the Department under section 502(c)(2) of ERISA shall be compiled inthe Public Documents Room of the Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration,Room N-5507, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington,DC 20210.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act  </ITAG>The Regulatory Flexibility Act imposes certain requirements with respectto rules which would have a significant impact on a substantial numberof small entities. A ``rule'' under the Regulatory Flexibility Act is onefor which a general notice of proposed rulemaking is required under section553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act. Under section 553(b) of theAdministrative Procedure Act a general notice of proposed rulemaking isnot required for rules of agency organization, procedure or practice. Thus,such rules are excluded from the definition of ``rule'' under the RegulatoryFlexibility Act. Since this procedural regulation is a rule of agency procedureor practice it is thus not subject to the requirements of the RegulatoryFlexibility Act.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291  </ITAG>The Department has determined that the regulation does not constitute a``major rule'' as that term is used in Executive Order 12291 because theaction would not result in: an annual effect on the economy of $100 million;a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,government agencies, or geographic regions; or significant adverse effectson competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or onthe ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-basedenterprises in domestic or export markets.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act  </ITAG>The Paperwork Reduction Act mandates that agencies provide data with respectto information collection requirements which may be imposed by certainregulatory action. Section 3518(c)(1)(B) of the Paperwork Reduction Actprovides that the requirements of that Act do not apply to administrativeactions involving specific individuals or entities. The Department hasdetermined that the administrative adjudications which would be conductedpursuant to the procedures contained in this regulation fall within thescope of this exemption from the Paperwork Reduction Act.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Statutory Authority  </ITAG>The regulation is adopted pursuant to the authority contained in sections502(c)(2) and 505 of ERISA (Pub. L. 93-406, 88 Stat. 892, 894; 29 U.S.C.1132(c), 1135).  <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 29 CFR Part 2570  </ITAG>Adminstrative practice and procedure, Employee benefit plans, EmployeeRetirement Income Security Act, Party in interest, Law enforcement, Pensions,Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration, Prohibited transactions.<ITAG tagnum="84">Final Rule  </ITAG>In view of the foregoing the Department is amending Part 2570 of ChapterXXV of Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations as follows:  <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 2570_[AMENDED]  </ITAG>1.
