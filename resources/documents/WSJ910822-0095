Albert Gore, announced he wouldn'trun in 1992.   Sen. Gore said his decision was based on personalconsiderations: &quot;My family -- my wife and four young children-- are more important than politics and personal ambition.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The Tennessee senator is the latest in a string ofDemocrats to bow out of the race. These include Sens. BillBradley of New Jersey and Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia,and Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri.   Currently, the only announced candidate is formerMassachusetts Sen. Paul Tsongas; Iowa's liberal Democraticsenator, Tom Harkin, is likely to declare next month. Neitherof these candidates, however, is considered very formidable,and either would be a prohibitive underdog in a generalelection against George Bush.   Thus, the Gore announcement is likely to focus anew thespotlight on New York Gov. Mario Cuomo. The New Yorkgovernor, who delights in causing press speculation about hisintentions, says he has no plans to run but won't rule outchanging his mind.   As a candidate, Gov. Cuomo would have clear weaknesses --in particular, his identification as a New York liberal,which wouldn't play well in much of the South, and hisstate's financial woes, which would make it tougher tocapitalize on the economic issue nationally. But hiscommanding presence and intellect privately worry some topBush strategists, and generally he's rated the Democrats'strongest candidate by political experts from both parties.   &quot;Cuomo is the only semi-heavyweight left in the Democraticfield,&quot; said Douglas Bailey, a Republican strategist. The NewYork governor, he thinks, would have problems but still wouldbe a substantial challenger: &quot;It isn't as hard for the publicto imagine a President Cuomo dealing with this week's crisisas it would be the others.&quot;   Several other candidates may yet jump in. Virginia Gov. L.Douglas Wilder is mulling a bid, although the nation's firstblack governor has lost some luster lately in a messypolitical and legal feud with Sen. Charles Robb (D., Va.).Two-time presidential candidate and civil rights leader JesseJackson hasn't said what he'll do yet, although severalJackson intimates believe he's more likely to skip 1992. Inrecent weeks former, California Gov. Edmund Brown Jr. hasbeen making sounds about elevating his comeback hopes from aSenate race to a presidential quest. This brings only smilesfrom Republican strategists.   Other than Gov. Cuomo, the most promising possibleaspirant may be Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton. He has wonconsiderable praise for his achievements during his 10 1/2years as governor, and at 45 years of age is an attractive,forceful and telegenic campaigner. But he's untested innational politics and foreign policy.   By contrast, Sen. Gore was tested politically when he rana reasonably respectable race in the 1988 Democraticprimaries. He also has foreign policy credentials aided byhis support for the Persian Gulf war.   Undoubtedly, personal considerations were a major factorin the Tennessee Democrat's decision. He noted that hiseight-year-old son was critically injured in an automobileaccident two years ago, and it's known that he worried thatthe time and distance of a presidential campaign would bevery hard on his children. Other Gore advisers worried thatit's going to be tough for anyone to defeat George Bush, andtwo consecutive losing quests might end the presidentialhopes of the 43-year-old moderate Democrat.   But Sen. Gore insisted if it weren't for the familyfactors, he would have run. &quot;I honestly believe that nextyear could be a very tough one for President Bush,&quot; he saidin an interview. &quot;The economy is anemic at best, and thepresident has no program for economic recovery or health careor any domestic agenda at all. He is vulnerable to a well-runDemocratic campaign.&quot;   However, nobody yet has come up with the Democrat to leadsuch a campaign.</TEXT></DOC>
