Accelerator contains induction accelerating sections, coaxiallylocated and connected in series. Induction sections are characterizedby radial dimensions successively increasing in direction perpendicularto the axis; they are located one inside another and fixed with electriccontact on one of the face flanges of the accelerator. Sufficient decreaseof linear dimensions of the accelerator - about 5 times - at output electronbeam energy of the order of 10 MeV was achieved. 2 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
