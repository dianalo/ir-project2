The teacher replies, &quot; Si, por favorhable en Espanol.&quot;   In schools all across America, Hispanic children eager andready to learn English are being taught their lessons inSpanish instead. Their story -- and its disturbingconsequences for the children and society -- is told byRosalie Pedaline Porter in &quot;Forked Tongue: The Politics ofBilingual Education&quot; (Basic Books, 288 pages, $22.95).</LP><TEXT>   Ms. Porter has spent nearly 20 years in the field ofbilingual education, first as a teacher, then as theadministrator of a successful program fornon-English-speaking children in Newton, Mass., and finallyas an outspoken critic of bilingual education. Herrealization that bilingual education is an ineffective methodto teach English came slowly and at considerable risk to hercareer. An early bilingual education enthusiast, Ms. Porterhoped to help a new generation of non-English-speakingyoungsters avoid what she'd gone through as a frightened,six-year-old Italian immigrant, forced to learn Englishunassisted. But Ms. Porter's enthusiasm waned as she tried toput into practice the theories she'd learned for herundergraduate degree in bilingual education.   Her first assignment was teaching kindergarten andelementary school in Springfield, Mass. Most of her day wasspent teaching the children in Spanish. She recalls dutifullyasking a young boy to identify a green box: &quot;Juan, que colores este?&quot; she asked, and he replied, &quot;Green.&quot; The boy'sresponse wasn't surprising, because most of the students werePuerto Ricans born in Massachusetts, not recent immigrants.They came from homes in which Spanish and English werespoken. Nonetheless, Ms. Porter toed the line. &quot;Verde,&quot; shecorrected the boy, and he repeated, &quot;Green.&quot; Says Ms. Porter:&quot;I came to feel that I was going about things the wrong wayaround, as if I were deliberately holding back the learningof English.&quot;   Eventually, she began introducing more English instructioninto the school day -- and the children thrived. Ms. Porterdeveloped her methods further when she became anadministrator in the Newton school system, which providedintensive English-language instruction fornon-English-speaking children. There, her efforts to teachstudents English provoked the enmity of thebilingual-education bureaucracy. She became the target of avindictive campaign to impugn her personal integrity anddiscredit the Newton program. It was only over strenuousobjections from the state education department's bilingualbureaucracy that Ms. Porter's critique of bilingual educationultimately earned her a doctoral degree from the Universityof Massachusetts at Amherst.   According to bilingual advocates, non-English-speakingchildren must develop a firm foundation in their nativelanguage before they can learn academic subjects in a newlanguage. Mexican-American children in California, forexample, spend as little as 20 minutes a day being instructedin English while they learn most of their lessons in Spanish.   The problem with bilingual education theory, according toMs. Porter and a growing list of critics, is that it ignoresthe most important principle of education: The more time achild spends on a given task, the more likely he or she is toremember the lesson. Hispanic children who spend hours a daylistening to Spanish may develop better skills in thatlanguage, but they're not likely to learn English as well asstudents who are given intensive help learning the newlanguage. Because virtually all these students will spendtheir lives in the U.S., bilingual education may ultimatelydeprive them of the ability to earn a decent living or moveinto the social mainstream.   So why do ethnic leaders promote bilingual education? Ms.Porter thinks they're motivated by their own desire topreserve Hispanic culture and language in the face of theinevitable pressure to assimilate. As she reminds readers,such attempts are usually futile: Witness the fate of Gaelicin Ireland, where the government has spent years trying tosave the country's ancient language by mandating its teachingin the public schools, to no avail. Ms. Porter also believesthat bilingual bureaucrats want to protect their own jobs andexercise control over the Hispanic community.   Despite the program's shortcomings, mainstreampolicy-makers continue to support bilingual education.Granted, the federal government recently increased itsfunding for programs that emphasize more English instruction.But most programs are supported by state and local funds, andat those levels, the trend is to expand native-languageprograms. A proposed New York state plan, already givenpreliminary approval, will extend native-language instructionfrom elementary through high school and will allow someHispanic youngsters to take graduation exams in Spanish.   In reacting to this trend, Ms. Porter is at her best whenspeaking from personal experience. She is weakest when sheveers off onto discussions of education research, much of itfrom other countries. And she spends too much time trying torefute the assertions of bilingual-education theorists, whenher most eloquent case rests in her descriptions of what goeson in bilingual classrooms. By sharing her own experiences,Ms. Porter may succeed in exposing the inanity of currentbilingual education policy.   ---   Ms. Chavez, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute forPolicy Research, was director of the U.S. Commission on CivilRights during the Reagan administration.</TEXT></DOC>
