President Jose Napoleon Duarte is dying of liver cancer, hisgoverning Christian Democratic Party is divided, and a leftistinsurgency persists into its eighth year.   The changes Thursday, the most sweeping in five years, wereannounced hours after U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz mettop officers at the Defense Ministry to discuss the civil war andallegations of human rights abuses by the military.   Gen. Adolfo Blandon, head of the joint chiefs of staff,announced the changes at a news conference at his headquarters.   Last week, Blandon and acting President Rodolfo CastilloClaramount acknowledged there had been talk of a military coup, butthey dismissed it as idle musing.   The armed forces, which have great power and influence under thecivilian government, called Thursday's changes routine.   ``The changes are comparable in scope to those of 1983, whenwhat was achieved was a more dynamic army,'' Blandon said.   The commanders of the brigades based in Chalatenango and Morazanprovinces _ the two zones where the insurgency is strongest _ wereamong those replaced.   Shultz told reporters he planned to tell the military brass``that we must see a strong effort, as we have seen, to combat theterrorist guerrillas.''   The United States has poured huge amounts of aid into ElSalvador, but the army has been unable to end the civil war thathas killed an estimated 65,000 people since 1979.   Blandon also said it was ``probable'' he would retire in thecoming months. He has headed the joint chiefs since 1983.   He said several senior officers had retired after completing 30years of service, ``making way for younger officers to rise.''Recent armed forces unrest has been blamed on unhappiness amongyounger officers, who believed their careers have been stagnatingsince the 1983 shake-up.   Security forces were blamed for the murder of tens of thousandsof suspected leftists in the early 1980s.   The record improved markedly after Duarte took office, butpolitically motivated killings have been rising this year. Manywere blamed on security forces or right-wing death squads.   Duarte's diagnosis early in June added to the general climate ofinstablity in El Salvador.   The president is now in Washington for treatment. His doctorssay he probably has a few months to live. His party has split overchosing a candidate for the March 1989 presidential elections.</TEXT></DOC>
