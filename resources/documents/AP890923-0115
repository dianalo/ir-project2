He also warned Japan's leading opposition party, the Socialists,that their desire to modify a mutual security treaty with the UnitedStates is wrong.   The Socialists, helped by scandals and a controversial tax reformthat have eroded support for the long-governing conservatives,currently are riding a wave of popularity in Japan.   ``Anybody that thinks you ought to tamper or rewrite or modifythe security treaty is wrong,'' Quayle told reporters traveling withhim on Air Force II. ``It is not just a mere piece of paper. It isan alliance, security, deterrence.''   More than 50,000 U.S. troopers are stationed throughout Japanunder the treaty the Socialists want modified.   The Socialists also have urged strict checks to ensure U.S. Navyvessels calling on Japanese ports do not have nuclear weapons onboard _ a call in conflict with Washington's policy of refusing tosay whether or not its ships carry nuclear arms.   During a visit to Japan's northernmost main island of Hokkaido,Quayle said America shares Japan's ``heartfelt desire'' for a returnof several small islands off Hokkaido's northern shores, which Japancalls its ``northern territories.''   ``We hope the idea of glasnost and perestroika will someday cometo the northern territories and that they will be rightfullyreturned to Japan,'' Quayle said in a speech at the officialresidence of Hokkaido's Gov. Takahiro Yokomichi.   Soviet troops occupied the islands in the closing days of WorldWar II in 1945, and Japanese civilians were evacuated.   The territorial dispute has stalled completion of a treatyformally ending the war and a visit to Japan by Soviet PresidentMikhail S. Gorbachev.   Gorbachev's reforms are based on his policies of glasnost, oropenness, and perestroika, the restructing of the government andeconomy.   Quayle traveled to the Japanese Air Self Defense Force base atChitose, where he was briefed on Soviet military strength in thearea.   Col. Minoru Hoso, flight group commander of the Second Air Wing,told Quayle the Soviets have stationed one army division, or about10,000 troops, in the disputed islands. He said they also have400,000 troops in the region, along with 800 ships and 2,400aircraft.   Quayle later visited the American Misawa Air Base, on thenorthern tip of Honshu, Japan's main island, where he spoke to about1,000 military personnel and their families before returning toTokyo in the evening.   He was accompanied by his wife, Marilyn, and the U.S. ambassadorto Japan, Michael Armacost, and his wife.   Quayle arrived in Tokyo on Thursday from South Korea on thesecond leg of an Asia tour that will take him to the Philippines andMalaysia.</TEXT></DOC>
