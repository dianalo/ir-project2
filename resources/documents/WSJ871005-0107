Joe Biden, Teddy Kennedy and other moralizing senators relied on a tactic once called the big lie. They repeated their charges so often they sounded as if they must be true, when the truth is the precise opposite. In particular, they repeated to exhaustion that Judge Bork does not believe the 14th Amendment applies to women. What Judge Bork in fact said was that the due process and equal protection clauses apply to &quot;all persons&quot; -- women, blacks, everyone. He said there should not be &quot;strict scrutiny&quot; of laws applied to blacks and a lower level of review for women, that the same test should apply to all.    The American Civil Liberties Union also used sleight of hand in a news release that &quot;Judge Bork, in a 1985 speech, said it would be a good thing if religion were reintroduced into public schools.&quot; Judge Bork did give a speech observing that the &quot;resurgence in the political assertiveness of religion-based movements&quot; is a reaction to the court's &quot;deliberate and thoroughgoing exclusion of religion.&quot; But nowhere did he endorse religion or school prayer. Asked to comment, an ACLU spokesperson said its claim was &quot;merely an extrapolation&quot; from Judge Bork's speech.    Some of this &quot;extrapolation&quot; is by people who truly should know better. Over the past several days we've had several discussions with Harvard Law's Laurence Tribe over the letter that appears opposite. The Biden material on which he initially relied gave an incorrect reference saying Judge Bork dismissed the Ninth Amendment as a &quot;waterblot.&quot; In the hearings, Judge Bork did use the phrase &quot;inkblot,&quot; as follows: &quot;I do not think you can use the Ninth Amendment unless you know something of what it means. For example, if you had an amendment that says 'Congress shall make no' and then there is an inkblot, and you cannot read the rest of it, and that is the only copy you have, I do not think the court can make up what might be under the inkblot.&quot;    What is at issue here is Mr. Tribe's pet project of using the Ninth Amendment as carte blanche for judges to create whatever new constitutional rights fit their fancy. Judge Bork does reject the notion &quot;that under the Ninth Amendment the court was free to make up more Bills of Rights.&quot; But it is Mr. Tribe who is out of the mainstream; he surely knows the Supreme Court has never used the Ninth Amendment in the way he advocates.    Watching the anti-intellectualism of the assault on Judge Bork, we're reminded of the campus anti-intellectualism of the 1960s. In reaction to the universities' failure to defend reason or free speech, those who treasured these values founded the neoconservative movement in this country. Significantly, many of the people who reacted to those times by embracing conservative political ideas became the men and women who stocked the brain trust of the Reagan revolution.    Whether or not Judge Bork is confirmed, this shabby treatment of the nation's most distinguished legal scholar and jurist will not soon be forgotten. Both conservatives and liberals who hold dear the ideals of rational discourse and honest scholarship will be passionate in their outrage, and that passion is likely to have lasting intellectual and political effects. </TEXT></DOC>
