In the West Bank, a village leader was killed by an assailant whosuspected him of cooperating with Israeli authorities, Arab reportssaid. The reports said Abdel Rahim Awad, 62, was shot 14 times inthe chest in Kafr Laqif.   The army confirmed the slaying. Awad is the 96th Palestiniankilled by his fellow Arabs on suspicion of cooperating with Israeliauthorities.   In the Gaza Strip, the army sealed three rooms in homes owned byPalestinians accused of attacking Arab collaborators, an armyspokesman said.   Troops shot and wounded three Palestinians in Gaza, including a17 year old who was in critical condition, Arab hospital officialssaid. An army spokesman said the military is investigating theincidents.   Also Friday, a new security policy that requires Gaza Stripresidents to show computerized identification cards before enteringIsrael took effect.   Traffic to Israel from Gaza was light, but officials said thatwas mainly because Friday is a Moslem prayer day, not because of astrike call by Palestinian activists opposed to the new cards.   Israeli newspapers reported that reserve soldier Yariv Bar-Yoseffinished work as a night guard at the state-run television studioThursday, put an Uzi submachine gun to his head and shot himself.   In a suicide letter, Bar-Yosef, 25, said he faced questioning bymilitary police and feared he would become a scapegoat for othersoldiers involved in the beating death of Hani el-Shami in August1988, the reports said.   They quoted his letter as referring to Israel as ``a land thatdevours its people.''   An army spokesman refused comment on the suicide, saying the casewas under investigation.   Four soldiers of an elite infantry brigade were charged withbeating to death el-Shami while on patrol. They were acquitted ofmanslaughter but convicted of brutality after a military tribunalruled that el-Shami died of beatings inflicted at the Jabaliyadetention center, where he was taken after being beaten by thesoldiers.   Bar-Yosef served at the detention center and told investigatorshe kicked el-Shami in the shoulder the day he died.   At least 537 Palestinians have been killed in clashes withsoldiers or Israelis since the uprising against Israeli rule of theWest Bank and Gaza Strip began in December 1987. Thirty-eightIsraelis have died.   The army spokesman said the military sealed rooms in three Gazahomes owned by Arabs accused of membership in ``popularcommittees,'' attacking Arabs who cooperated with Israel andthreatening an Arab policeman who worked with the militaryauthorities.   Israel says sealing or demolishing homes is necessary as a meansof deterrence. The army has sealed or demolished at least 330 homein the occupied territories during the uprising against Israelioccupation.   The United States and European nations have condemned themeasures as violations of human rights.   Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip were ordered toboycott their jobs in Israel, starting Friday, to protest the new IDcards. Israel radio said some Arab workers spent Thursday night inIsrael to avoid crossing the checkpoint.   Israeli officials said they introduced the cards to prevent Arabswith criminal or security records from entering Israel, butPalestinian reporters said the new system is an attempt to puteconomic pressure on Gazans who work in Israel.</TEXT></DOC>
