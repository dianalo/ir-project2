Spokeswoman Brigitte Zimmermann said the lawyer, Gregor Gysi,was the only candidate for the post.   She said in briefing reporters on a closed-door session of theemergency congress that delegates were also choosing a 100-memberparty board that will constitute its next leadership, serving undera chairman.   That meant the party had abolished its traditional hierarchy ofa general secretary, a Politburo and the policy-making CentralCommittee. The structure was a holdover from the Stalinist era.   Ms. Zimmermann said the 2,753 delegates decided unanimously notto dissolve the party but also decided by a more than a 3-1 marginto change its name from the Socialist Unity Party of Germany to anew name yet to be chosen.   The Communists have lost much of their control over society inrecent weeks and have granted historic concessions to theopposition, including opening the Berlin Wall and other borders, ina desperate effort to shed their Stalinist legacy and remain inpower.   Mass demonstrations throughout East German demanded reforms,greater freedom and the prosecution of corrupt former officials.Tens of thousands of East Germans fled earlier this year to WestGermany.   Gysi has spoken out for broad political and economic reforms andhas acted as lawyer for the opposition group New Forum. He belongedto the interim party leadership and heads a committee investigatingcorruption allegations against the ousted leadership.   In an earlier address to the congress, Gysi said the capitalistsystem in Western societies was not ``something one cannot learnfrom.'' He said it was limited by ``transnational concerns, theinternational military-industrial complex.''   Gysi said the crisis here could only be solved if East Germanyfound a ``third way, beyond Stalinist socialism and the power oftransnational monopolies.''   He called for a ``free competition'' in East German society. Hedeclared, ``We need a full break with the failed Stalinism,'' whichhe blamed for the country's political and economic crisis.   Earlier, the congress went behind closed doors after a five-hourdebate failed to produce agreement on the course of the emergencysession.   Many delegates insisted on continuing a debate to explore abusesof the past. But others insisted that the party first needs newleadership.   The deep differences reflected the rifts in the party. Ms.Zimmermann said membership had dropped from 2.3 million to lessthan 1.8 million in recent months.   Party sources said Premier Hans Modrow also presented a reporton the work of the now-ousted Communist Party Central Committee,which quit in disgrace on Sunday.   The historic congress, held in an East Berlin sports hall, beganby debating the party's proposed program that calls for freeelections and broad cooperation with opposition groups.   Elsewhere in Eastern Europe:   _Czechoslovakia's Communist leaders offered to surrender theircontrol over the government for the first time in 41 years andaccept a minority role in a coalition Cabinet.   _Bulgarian Communists ousted six members of the ruling partyPolitburo and 20 members of the policy-making Central Committee,including former hard-line party chief Todor Zhivkov.   _The Soviet Communist Party's Central Committee planned anextraordinary meeting Saturday to set the agenda for the SovietUnion's parliament next week.   The East German Communists moved the emergency congress aheadone week, worried that their slipping control of national affairswas contributing to an atmosphere of instability. The congress,shown live on national TV, could continue through Sunday.   Modrow gave the keynote speech and echoed calls for CommunistParty unity.   ``Let us not allow the party to be broken, to go under, butlet's make it clean and strong,'' he said, to applause.   ``We, too, are the people,'' Modrow said, referring to theslogan widely used by pro-democracy demonstrators.   Modrow, one of the few Communists with broad popularity, alsoruled out reunification of the two Germanys.   ``Reunification is not on the agenda,'' he said as the delegatesbroke into long applause.   The German state was divided into Communist East Germany andcapitalist, pro-Western West Germany after the defeat of AdolfHitler's Nazi regime in World War II.   Herbert Kroker, chairman of the party's 25-member interimleadership committee, told delegates they were dealing not onlywith the fate of the party but also with the fate of East Germany.   If the party split, Kroker said, ``we would also destroy thehope for a free and cohesive society that we and the others want.''   The Socialist Unity Party, as the Communists are officiallyknown, was created in 1946 through the forced merger of the GermanCommunist Party and the Social Democrats.   Party leader Walter Ulbrich ruled until 1971, when he wasreplaced by Erich Honecker.   As hundreds of thousands of East Germans began taking to thestreets in October to demand free elections and other democraticreforms, the hard-line Honecker was forced to resign on Oct. 18.   He was replaced by Egon Krenz, who opened the Berlin Wall andgave the East Germans the freedom to travel they had not enjoyedsince the wall was built in 1961.   Krenz also made promises of free elections and other reforms,but his long-time association with the corruption-wracked Honeckerregime forced him to step down on Sunday, just six weeks aftertaking office.   The ruling Politburo and the entire 163-member policy-makingCentral Committee also resigned in an unprecedented move. Theleadership was replaced by the 25-member panel of reformers, whodrew up the party's new program.   Honecker and 11 other former high-ranking officials have beenexpelled from the party. Honecker, 77, is under criminalprosecution, and seven former Politburo members have beenimprisoned on corruption charges.</TEXT></DOC>
