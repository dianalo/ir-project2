The announcement surprised many industry observers, who had expected Compaq to unveil its long-awaited line of laptop computers. The laptops may be coming soon, however. Asked when the company would roll out the smaller portables, Rod Canion, Compaq's president, said, &quot;I won't be specific, but there will be other announcements of new products this year.&quot;    The new desktop computer, the DeskPro 386-20E, uses the popular Intel Corp. 80386 microchip, and sports a trimmer design and some technical improvements, such as built-in graphics. For the company's previous model, the DeskPro 386-20, graphics had to be bought separately.    Analysts said Compaq's 15% price cut from its previous model, a widely used business machine, was a clear attempt to head off a challenge from IBM's PS-2 Model 70. Compaq's machine will list for $7,999, including a 110-megabyte hard disk for storage; a similar Model 70 has a list price of $7,995.    &quot;It's a very aggressive price,&quot; said Jim Poyner, an analyst with William Woodruff andamp; Co. in Dallas. Mr. Poyner said that Compaq's gross margin had been declining in recent quarters, and that the new pricing &quot;raises concerns that they'll have to sell a lot more computers.&quot; But Compaq officials said margins wouldn't suffer; the lower prices, they noted, reflected slashed production costs.    Mr. Poyner was surprised that Compaq didn't introduce the laptops it has often said it is working on. He said analysts were &quot;shocked&quot; in meetings with the company earlier this summer, when Compaq disclosed statistics showing its share of the portable market -- including laptops -- had shrunk from about 65% in the first quarter to just below 50% in the second quarter.    Introducing a laptop &quot;has to be done soon,&quot; said Eugene Glazer, a Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. analyst. &quot;November is too late. The others are gaining momentum.&quot; But a month or two shouldn't matter at this stage in a developing market, insisted Michael Swaveley, Compaq's vice president, sales and marketing. &quot;Ninety-five percent of the opportunity in the laptop market is still there,&quot; he said.    Compaq has shunned laptops until recently, arguing that it didn't want to introduce a laptop that wasn't as powerful as its desktop models. Compaq's portables are about the size of a tool box, but unlike smaller laptops, they don't run on batteries.    Mr. Canion conceded yesterday that Compaq had been hurt by the advanced laptops introduced by Toshiba Corp., Zenith Electronics Corp. and NEC Corp. Those models, while still not as powerful as desktop models, have proven successful with consumers, providing Compaq with an added incentive to move quickly into the growing market.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Compaq shares closed at $54.50, down $1. </TEXT></DOC>
