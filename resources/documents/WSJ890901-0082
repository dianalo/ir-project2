In fact, of the city officials and company executives interviewed, none could name a single major contract that was denied because of a company's ties to South Africa, where the government continues its internationally condemned policy of racial separation.    The idea sounded simple: If companies retained links with South Africa, cities would deny them contracts, and thus pressure them to cut those ties. Implementing that policy has been another matter. Most municipal officials underestimated not only the difficulty of discerning corporate ties to South Africa but also the complexity of defining which ties are acceptable and which aren't.    Those aren't the only complications. Most municipal services come from small companies with few foreign ties of any kind, so the new laws were essentially aimed at multinational companies. Yet some laws apply only to small contracts -- leaving the multinationals unscathed. And in some places where the rules apply to even the biggest transactions, cities are finding they need big companies more than big companies need them.    &quot;We call it the IBM problem,&quot; says Ibrahim Gassama of Transafrica, a lobbying group based in Washington, D.C. The computer giant, which retains significant ties with its former South African subsidiary, is a tough supplier to avoid because of its dominant position in mainframe computers. &quot;We get calls all the time from various localities trying to tighten up their laws. Cities from San Francisco to Pittsburgh have this problem.&quot;    A New York City law, for example, flatly bars the city from buying goods that originate in South Africa, such as diamonds, gold or sardines. But it doesn't cover companies whose parents have units in South Africa -- links known as &quot;brother-sister&quot; relationships -- or substantial business ties there. It also doesn't cover nonownership relationships such as licensing, trademark and franchise agreements held by giants including General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and International Business Machines Corp. In addition, a supplier of, say, office products, doesn't have to vouch for the manufacturer of the goods it sells, because the law covers only the immediate contractor.    &quot;If a parent had a company called Apartheid Inc. in South Africa, and they had a subsidiary here called Apartheid USA, the city could contract with it,&quot; fumes Manhattan Deputy Borough President David DeLeon.    Until June, local anti-apartheid measures also were hitting snags with the U.S. government. The Transportation Department threatened to cut off funding for various projects in states where sanction measures were deemed &quot;exclusionary and discriminatory&quot; for bidders, in violation of federal rules. When the department moved to cut off $125 million in funds for a Seattle transit project, Senator Brock Adams (D., Wash.) pushed through a rider barring such interference.    Determined to overcome such obstacles, some cities already are rewriting their laws. Miloanne Heckathorn, a consultant for Oakland, Calif., studied laws in 25 localities last year when Oakland decided to tighten its 1985 law.    Under its ordinance, Oakland tries to avoid contracts with companies that it lists as doing business in South Africa. The list, redrawn by Ms. Heckathorn last year, covers license and franchise agreements, though it still doesn't touch brother-sister companies.    As a result, more Apple Computer Inc. and Compaq Computer Inc. personal computers have been put on city desktops, because neither company is on the sanction list. This denies some sales to IBM, where price and performance are roughly comparable. But Ms. Heckathorn concedes the law hasn't denied any major contracts to big companies because another provision requires the city to accept the lower bid -- even from a company on the sanction list -- if the next bid is more than 5% higher.    &quot;If {a competitor} is 8% above General Motors' price, General Motors would get the contract,&quot; she says. &quot;Basically the ordinance says the city is willing to pay only up to 5% more&quot; to implement its social policy. GM sold its South African unit, renamed Delta Motor Corp., but the firm operates under a licensing and supply agreement with GM that, supporters of South Africa sanctions say, vitiates the effect of the divestiture.    Even so, Ms. Heckathorn feels Oakland's law has the potential to work because it gives companies that don't have South African connections an edge over those that do. If that edge hasn't been enough to deny a major contract, Ms. Heckathorn says, it's because Oakland couldn't afford to put a high enough preference figure in the law.    Joel Copperman, a New York City contracting official, says trying to penalize offending companies while not damaging the purchasing process can be a tough balancing act. &quot;If you made it so that {the law barred} all the auto manufacturers, then what would you do?&quot; he asks. &quot;The city has to buy cars. You have to find the balance that encourages them to get out of South Africa without having a law that amounts to nothing.&quot; Still, Mr. Copperman says he knows of no &quot;significant cases&quot; where the city wasn't able to buy from the low bidder because of its South Africa law.    The situation frustrates many city officials. David Dinkins, Manhattan borough president and a mayoral candidate, wants New York to stop granting service and purchase contracts to Minnesota Mining andamp; Manufacturing Co., which has a subsidiary in South Africa. Easier said than done: The city looked hard and found an alternative microfiche reader-printer from Eastman Kodak Co., but it cost twice as much. &quot;And the service 3M supplies on this is phenomenal,&quot; says a city official familiar with the procurement problem.    Under New York's law, if a company can't certify that it is free of significant ties to South Africa, and if its bid isn't more than 5% lower than that of a company without such ties, the Board of Estimate can choose to give the contract to the &quot;clean&quot; bidder. But if an agency determines that no other &quot;clean&quot; company can provide goods or services comparable to those of a South Africa-linked company, it can ask the Board of Estimate to approve a contract with the company. Hence, companies like 3M can still get the business.    &quot;The tougher the law, the more opportunity for a safety valve you have to have,&quot; says George Wolfberg, chief administrative analyst with the Los Angeles city administrative office. He calls New York's law &quot;a tough statement with nothing to back it up,&quot; but his city's statute may not have much more bite.    Los Angeles amended its statute last month to cover franchise and distributorship relationships. Now, a supplier has to certify that neither it nor the maker of the goods it sells either owns or has other substantial interests in South African companies.    A sanction-list company won't be considered unless its bid is 10% below a &quot;clean&quot; company, up from 5%. To get around that law, a city agency must request a waiver from the city council, arguing that the desired item is essential and can't be procured except from the sanction-list company.    But the Los Angeles effort has a major loophole: It doesn't apply to goods costing more than $25,000, though services are covered. &quot;And there doesn't seem to be anything we can do about it,&quot; Mr. Wolfberg says. </TEXT></DOC>
