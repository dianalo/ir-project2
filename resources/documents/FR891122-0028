Thecommentary applies and interprets the requirements of Regulation Z andis a substitute for individual staff interpretations. The majority of theproposed revisions address the amendments to Regulation Z issued in April1989 to implement the Fair Credit and Charge Card Disclosure Act of 1988and the amendments to the regulation issued in June 1989 to implement theHome Equity Loan Consumer Protection Act of 1988. The proposal incorporatesmuch of the guidance provided when those regulatory changes were adoptedand addresses additional questions that have been raised about applicationof the new requirements. The other proposals deal with other provisionsof Regulation Z, including the rules on substitution of telephone creditcards.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>Comments must be received on or before January 19, 1990.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>Comments should refer to Docket No. TIL-1 and be sentto Mr. William W.

Effective October 13, 1981,an official staff commentary (TIL-1, Supp. I to 12 CFR part 226) was publishedto interpret the regulation. The commentary is designed to provide guidanceto creditors in applying the regulation to specific transactions and isupdated periodically to address significant questions that arise. Therehave been eight general updates and one limited update so far. This noticecontains the proposed ninth general update. It is expected that it willbe adopted in final form in March 1990 with optional compliance until theuniform effective date of October 1, 1990, for mandatory compliance.(2) <T3>Proposed revisions.</T3> Within the last year the Board adopted twomajor sets of amendments to Regulation Z. The first of these were amendmentspublished in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on April 6, 1989 (54 FR 13855) to implement theFair Credit and Charge Card Disclosure Act of 1988, Public Law No. 100-583,102 Stat. 2960 (FCCCDA). (The Board also adopted technical amendments toRegulation Z, in further implementation of FCCCDA, published on August11, 1989, 54 FR 32953.) The mandatory effective date for the major portionof FCCCDA was August 31, 1989, with the effective date for certain provisionsdelayed until November 29, 1989.The second major set of amendments to Regulation Z comprised amendmentspublished in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on June 9, 1989 (54 FR 24670) to implement theHome Equity Loan Consumer Protection Act of 1988, Public Law No. 100-709,102 Stat. 4725 (HELCPA). (See also the correction notice published on July7, 1989, 54 FR 28665.) The mandatory effective date of HELCPA was November7, 1989.The <T4>Federal Register</T4> notices containing the regulatory amendmentsimplementing FCCCDA and HELCPA set forth a large amount of supplementarymaterial interpreting the new regulations. In order to provide ongoingguidance, the proposed commentary revisions in this notice reflects, inlarge measure, that supplementary material. On some points the proposedcommentary differs from the material published earlier this year; significantdifferences are noted below. The proposed commentary also addresses a numberof issues that have arisen since the publication of the regulations.In addition to the issues arising with regard to FCCCDA and HELCPA, additionalrevisions are proposed concerning other provisions of Regulation Z. Forexample, the proposed commentary revisions discusses tax refund anticipationloans; a possible new mortgage product, the price-level adjusted mortgage;and open-end credit advertising.The text of all of the proposed revisions is presented below in the orderin which it would appear in the commentary. To facilitate review and comment,however, the descriptions of the revisions are presented separately forthe FCCCDA, the HELCPA, and the other provisions.<ITAG tagnum="84">Fair Credit and Charge Card Disclosure Act Provisions</ITAG>As mentioned above, the proposed commentary to the regulation incorporatesmuch of the supplementary information that accompanied the final amendmentswhen they were published in April 1989. Some new or revised material isincluded, however, as noted below.Section 226.5a Credit and Charge Card Applications and Solicitations<ITAG tagnum="81">5a(b) Required Disclosures</ITAG>Comment 5a(b)(1)-6 would be added to state that premium initial rates wouldbe required to be disclosed, although the rate that is otherwise applicablealso may be disclosed. This interpretation differs from the disclosurerequired for a discounted initial rate, for which the otherwise applicablerate must be shown.Comment 5a(b)(5)-1 would be added to state that a card issuer may, butneed not, refer to the beginning and ending point and briefly state anyapplicable conditions for any grace period. <ITAG tagnum="81">5a(c) Direct Mail Applications and Solicitations</ITAG>Comment 5a(c)-1 discusses in detail the distinctions between applicationsand solicitations subject to the direct mail rule and those subject tothe ``take-one'' rules.<ITAG tagnum="81">5a(e) Applications and Solicitations Made Available to General Public</ITAG>Comment 5a(e)(2)-1 would explain the general rule that the credit informationprovided to a consumer under this disclosure option must be current asof the time it is mailed or delivered to the general public. Comment 5a(e)(2)-2would permit a card issuer to provide information that was current as ofthe time it was printed if the issuer also complies with andSection; 226.5a(e)(1)(ii)_thatis, states the date the required information was printed, including a statementthat it was accurate as of that date and is subject to change thereafter.Comment 5a(e)(3)-1 would prohibit card issuers from using this disclosureoption if any kind of reference is made to a term or condition of creditrequired to be disclosed under andSection; 226.5a(b) including statementssuch as ``favorable rates'' and ``low costs.''<ITAG tagnum="81">5a(g) Balance Computation Methods Defined</ITAG>Comment 5a(g)-2 would be added to discuss the applicability of the ``two-cycleaverage daily balance'' method. The interpretation incorporates a discussionof the technical clarification to the regulation about this method whichwas published on August 11, 1989 (54 FR 32953).Section 226.9 Subsequent Disclosure Requirements<ITAG tagnum="81">9(e) Disclosures Upon Renewal of Credit or Charge Card</ITAG>Comments would address the renewal notices for credit and charge card accountsin which an annual fee is imposed. Using employee preferential rates asan example, comment 9(e)-3 would explain that renewal notices should statethe terms actually imposed on the account.Comment 9(e)-4 would clarify how a card issuer discloses a variable ratewhen the rate that will be in effect if the cardholder renews the accountcannot be determined at the time the renewal notice is sent. Comment 9(e)-5discusses disclosure alternatives for card issuers that bill renewal feesmore often than annually.Comment 9(e)(1)-1 discusses how issuers may comply with the requirementthat cardholders who receive an advance notice must be given the lesserof 30 days or 1 full billing cycle both to make a decision about the renewalof the account and to use the card without having the fee billed to theaccount.Section 226.28 Effect on State Laws<ITAG tagnum="81">28(d) Special Rule for Credit and Charge Cards</ITAG>Comments 28(d)-1 through 28(d)-3 would be added to provide guidance onthe scope of preemption of state laws under the Fair Credit and ChargeCard Disclosure Act. The comments discuss the field of preemption, explainingthat it extends to any state law requiring disclosure of credit informationin open-end consumer credit or charge card applications, solicitations,or renewal notices. To address the issue of state laws that apply to bothconsumer-and business-purpose credit cards, comment 28(d)-2 would providethat such laws would be preempted to the extent they apply to applicationsand solicitations for, and renewals of, open-end consumer credit and chargecard accounts. What effect preemption as to consumer-purpose cards wouldhave on the state law as it relates to business-purpose cards is a matterthat would be determined under state law.<ITAG tagnum="84">Home Equity Loan Consumer Protection Act Provisions</ITAG>Much of the information in the proposed commentary was contained in thesupplementary information to the final rule. Although much of the proposalis self-explanatory, several provisions have been highlighted below whichgiven additional guidance. The rules for home equity lines differ fromthose set forth in several existing commentary sections. Accordingly, theproposed commentary would add several cross references to the new homeequity provisions where it was thought that confusion might result.Section 226.5b Requirements for Home Equity Plans<ITAG tagnum="81">5b(a) Form of Disclosures</ITAG>Section 226.5b(a) requires most of the disclosures to be grouped togetherand ``segregated'' from unrelated information. Greater flexibility is permittedin complying with the segregation standard than currently exists for closed-endcredit. The commentary would provide examples of the type of additionalinformation that would be permitted with the required disclosures, andwould discuss alternative methods for providing the early disclosures.<ITAG tagnum="81">5b(b) Time Disclosures</ITAG>The commentary would offer guidance on when the disclosures are requiredin the case of general purpose applications, applications sent throughthe mail or made available to the public without need for a request (suchas ``take-ones''). It would address the case where creditors provide aresponse card instead of an application in solicitation materials sentto consumers; in such cases creditors need not provide the home equitydisclosures and brochure with the response card if the only action takenby the creditor upon receiving the card is to send an application to theconsumer (which would then be accompanied by the disclosures and a brochure),or to telephone the consumer regarding an application. The commentary wouldalso discuss the action that may be taken in cases where an applicationis denied or withdrawn within a certain time period.<ITAG tagnum="81">5b(c) Duties of Third Parties</ITAG>In addition to requiring creditors to provide disclosures and a brochureto consumers at an earlier time, andSection; 226.5b(c) of the regulationimposes a limited duty on third parties who provide applications to consumers.The commentary would discuss the duty of both third parties and creditorsin such cases.<ITAG tagnum="81">5b(d) Content of Disclosures</ITAG>Section 226.5b(d) of the regulation lists the information to be given toconsumers when they receive an application for home equity plans. The commentarywould provide examples of how to disclose the payment information requiredunder andSection; 226.5b(d)(5) for reverse mortgages. In addition, more guidancewould be offered on the types of fees that must be disclosed under andSection;226.5b(d) (7) and (8). The commentary would provide examples of the typeof fees that need not be disclosed. The commentary would clarify that thirdparty fees that must be disclosed include premiums for property insuranceif such fees are required to open a plan. It states that creditors mustprovide a good faith estimate of such third party fees, and may providea range or state the fees on the basis of a typical or representative creditline.Creditors who offer variable-rate transactions must provide informationabout the variable-rate feature under andSection; 226.5b(d)(12). Many ofthese disclosures are similar to those required under andSection;226.19(b)for closed-end adjustable rate mortgages. The commentary would offer additionalguidance on how to provide the maximum payment example required under andSection;226.5b(d)(12)(x), explaining that creditors should ignore any discountedor premium initial rates or periodic rate limitations for purposes of statingthe payment amount. The commentary also would discuss the requirement thatcreditors disclose the time by which the maximum rate would be imposed.In making this disclosure, creditors would assume that the rate increasesas rapidly as possible under the plan, and should factor in any discountedor premium initial rates or periodic rate limitations. Separate exampleswould be provided for the draw and any repayment phase and, in disclosingthe time at which the maximum rate could be reached, creditors would assumethe index and margin shown in the last year of the historical example (ora more recent rate) is in effect at the beginning of each phase.Additional guidance regarding the historical example required under andSection;226.5b(d)(12)(xi) also is provided. The commentary would clarify that creditorsshould assume that the $10,000 balance upon which the disclosures are basedis an advance taken at the beginning of the first billing cycle and isreduced according to the terms of the plan, and that the consumer takesno subsequent draws. Creditors would not assume that an additional advanceis taken at any time, including the beginning of any repayment period.In stating the payment information that must be provided in the historicalexample, the commentary also would clarify that, while calculations ofpayments should be based on the creditor's actual payment computation formula,the creditor may assume that all months have an equal number of days.The commentary would make clear that, in setting forth the margin, a creditormust select for each index a representative margin in preparing the historicalexample. Thus, the margin used must be one that was used in conjunctionwith the specific index.<ITAG tagnum="81">5b(f) Limitations on Home Equity Plans</ITAG>Section 226.5b(f) imposes substantive limitations on home equity plans.Specifically, it indicates how rate changes may be implemented, when acreditor may terminate a line and accelerate payment of the outstandingbalance, and when the original terms may be changed.The commentary to andSection; 226.5b(f)(2) would provide guidance regardingthe ability of creditors to terminate and accelerate a home equity plan.Comment 5b(f)(2)(ii)-1 would be added to clarify what constitutes failureto meet repayment terms for purposes of termination and acceleration. Underthe proposed comment, a creditor would be permitted to terminate and acceleratethe balance on a home equity line if the consumer has not made a paymentwithin 60 days of the due date. A failure to make payments also would bedeemed to occur if the consumer is in default for failing to make a requiredpayment and does not make the payment within 30 days after the creditorprovides the consumer with a written notice of the missed payment and ofthe consequences of continued failure to pay. This comment would parallelthe approach taken by several states (as well as regulations promulgatedby the Federal Home Loan Bank Board dealing with certain home loans) whichspecify that a creditor must provide consumers with a right to cure beforea creditor may accelerate payment of the balance of a debt or take otheraction. This provision would not override any state or other law that requiresa right to cure notice, or any longer time period required by such statelaw.The commentary to andSection; 226.5b(f)(3) would be added to provide guidanceon when certain changes can be made to a home equity agreement. For example,comment 5b(f)(3)-2 would provide that a creditor may pass on increasesin real estate taxes, and charges for property and credit insurance imposedby third parties notwithstanding the general prohibition on changing theterms of a home equity agreement.Comments 5b(f)(3)(vi)-1 through -10 would provide general guidance regardinga creditor's ability to suspend credit privileges and reduce the creditlimit on a home equity line. Comment 5b(f)(3)(vi)-3 would clarify thatcharges incurred by a creditor for credit reports and appraisals to determinewhether a condition justifying a freeze or reduction in the credit limitcontinues to exist may be passed on to the consumer. Material has beenincluded in comment 5b(f)(3)(vi)-8 to provide examples of events that couldconstitute a default of a material obligation.<ITAG tagnum="81">5b(g) Refund of Fees</ITAG>Proposed comments 5b(g)-1 through -4 provide guidance on the requirementthat creditors refund fees to consumers if the terms originally disclosedchange after the disclosures are provided.<ITAG tagnum="81">5b(h) Imposition of Nonrefundable Fees</ITAG>Proposed comment 5b(h)-1 provides that an application fee or membershipfee may be collected prior to the consumer receiving the disclosures (forexample, when an application contained in a magazine is mailed in withan application fee) only if such fees remain refundable for three daysafter the consumer receives the andSection; 226.5b disclosures. This wouldparallel the approach taken in comment 5(b)(1)-1 for open-end plans otherthan home equity plans.Proposed comment 5b(h)-2 provides that a fee may be collected after thedisclosures and brochure are received by the consumer but that the feemust be refunded if, within three days of receiving the required information,the consumer decides not to enter into the agreement. The consumer in sucha case must be notified that the fee is refundable for three days.Section 226.6 Initial Disclosure StatementProposed comments 6(e)-1 through -4 clarify the requirement that additionaldisclosures be provided, with the disclosures required under andSection;226.6, for home equity lines of credit.Section 226.9 Subsequent Disclosure RequirementsComment 9(c)-1 would be revised to include a reference to the limitationson changes in terms for home equity lines of credit. Proposed comment 9(c)(1)-6would be added to clarify that a change in terms notice is required ifa creditor renews a home equity line on terms other than those agreed tooriginally. Comment 9(c)(3)-1 would be added to clarify that a creditorneed not provide a notice if it freezes a line in circumstances that wouldpermit it to terminate and accelerate.Section 226.15 Right of Rescission<ITAG tagnum="81">15(a) Consumer's Right to Rescind</ITAG>Comment 15(a)(3)-2 would be revised to provide that the payment terms describedin andSection; 226.6(e)(2) for any repayment phase set forth in an initialagreement are ``material disclosures'' for purposes of rescission. However,neither the payment terms nor any other information given with the applicationdisclosures would be a material disclosure for purposes of rescission.Comment 15(a)(3)-3 would be modified to provide that the variable-rateinformation provided in footnote 12 to andSection; 226.6(a)(2) for variable-raterepayment phases set forth in an initial agreement is a material disclosure.Therefore, the circumstances under which the rate may increase; any limitationson the increase; and the effects of an increase for a variable rate featurefor both the draw and repayment phase would be material disclosures forpurposes of rescission.Section 226.16 AdvertisingComment 16(b)-2 would be revised to include a reference to the specialadvertising rules for home equity plans. Comments 16(d)-1 through -6 wouldbe added to clarify these rules. Comment 16(d)-2 would clarify that therules in andSection; 226.5b applicable to disclosing required information,including third party fees to open a line, may be relied upon in statingthe information in advertisements.Section 226.30 Limitations on RatesComments 30-1 and 30-11 would be revised to clarify how the home equityrules affect the requirements of andSection; 226.30. The revisions wouldmake clear that some types of loans may not be entered into after November7, 1989. For example, comment 30-1 would be revised to clarify that becausethe home equity rules prohibit creditors from reserving a contract rightto increase the rate in a fixed-rate open-end home equity plan, only suchloans entered into before November 7, 1989, would be subject to a rateceiling.<ITAG tagnum="84">Other Provisions of Regulation Z</ITAG>Section 226.12 Special Credit Card ProvisionsComment 12(a)(2)-9 would provide guidance to multiple entities that shareresponsibility for a card, such as where a single card has been issuedby a long-distance telephone company but both that company and a localtelephone company participate in matters such as authorization and billing.The proposed commentary would restrict either entity from issuing an additionalcredit card unless the existing card is terminated, so that, for example,the local company could not issue a new card of its own without ensuringthat the original card is terminated. Comments are specifically requested,however, on a less restrictive approach, such as permitting an additionalcredit card on the same account to be issued by any one of the entities,provided the cardholder's total liability for unauthorized use of the originaland the additional card cannot exceed the liability limit set forth inandSection; 226.12(b).Section 226.16 AdvertisingComment 16(b)-7 would be revised to give further guidance on terms thattrigger additional disclosures. For example, the comment explains thatthe phrase ``small monthly service charge on the remaining balance'' triggersadditional disclosures because the statement discloses how the amount ofthe finance charge will be determined, not because the statement uses theterm ``small'' in describing that a monthly service charge will be assessed.An additional example would be added to illustrate that a statement inan advertisement that no finance charge will be imposed for some limitedperiod of time triggers additional disclosures because it refers to a periodduring which credit can be repaid without a finance charge.Section 226.17 General Disclosure Requirements<ITAG tagnum="81">17(c) Basis of Disclosures and Use of Estimates</ITAG>Comment 17(c)(1)-11 would be revised to include ``price level adjustedmortgages'' (PLAMs) as an example of variable-rate transactions. (Referencesto PLAMs would be added to the commentary to andSection;andSection; 226.19and 226.30 noting that certain provisions would be inapplicable.) PLAMshave a fixed rate of interest but provide for periodic adjustments to paymentsand loan balance to reflect changes in an index measuring prices or inflation.The comment would apply to transactions that have been authorized to beinsured by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in a demonstrationprogram. HUD's regulations for PLAMs have not yet been adopted, but rulesare expected to be issued before the Regulation Z commentary revisionsbecome final in the spring of 1990.Comment 17(c)(1)-17 would be added to provide guidance on the basis fordisclosures for income tax refund anticipation loans (RALs). RALs are loansmade on the basis of a consumer's anticipated tax refund. Repayment ofRALs is typically made by an offset to a consumer's account, into whichthe consumer's tax refund has been deposited by electronic transfer. Thecomment provides that if repayment of the loan is required at the timethe refund is deposited into the consumer's account, this date must beestimated and used in the disclosures even if the loan contains a demandclause.Section 226.19 Certain Residential Mortgage TransactionsComment 19(b)-3 would be added to clarify what constitutes an ``intermediaryagent or broker.'' The new comment would make clear that a legal agentof the creditor (as determined by applicable state or other law) is notan intermediary agent. The comment would also provide several factors tobe considered by the creditor when determining whether or not the transactioninvolves an intermediary agent. Such factors would include the percentageof applications received by a creditor from a particular broker and theamount of time and preparation the broker puts into an application.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 226</ITAG>Advertising, Banks, Banking, Consumer protection, Credit, Federal ReserveSystem, Finance, Penalties, Rate limitations, Truth in lending.Certain conventions have been used to highlight the proposed revisions.New language is shown inside bold-faced arrows, while language that wouldbe removed is set off with brackets.(3) <T3>Text of proposed revisions.</T3> Pursuant to authority granted in section105 of the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1604 as amended), the Boardproposes to amend the official staff commentary to Regulation Z (12 CFRpart 226 Supp. I) as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 226 [AMENDED]</ITAG>1.

For example, if notransaction fee is imposed for purchases, the disclosure form may containthe ``Transaction fee for purchases'' heading and box, showing ``none''in the box, or the heading and box may be deleted from the table. Thereis an exception for the grace period disclosure, however: Even if no graceperiod exists, that fact must be stated.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>5a(a)(3) Exceptions.</T3> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. <T3>Coverage.</T3> Certain exceptions to the coverage of andSection;226.5aare stated in andSection;226.5a(a)(3); in addition, the requirements of andSection;226.5ado not apply to the following:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Lines of credit accessed solely by account numbers</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Addition of a credit or charge card to an existing open-endplan</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. <T3>Noncoverage of ``consumer initiate'' requests.</T3> Applications providedto a consumer upon request are not covered by andSection;226.5a, even ifthe request is made in response to the card issuer's invitation to applyfor a card account. To illustrate, if a card issuer invites consumers tocall a toll-free number or to return a response card to obtain an application.the application subsequently sent to the consumer need not contain thedisclosures required under andSection;226.5a. Similary, if the card issuerinvites consumers to call and make an oral application on the telephone,andSection;226.5a does not apply to the application made by the consumer.If, however, the card issuer calls a consumer or initiates a telephonediscussion with a consumer about opening a card account and contemporaneouslytakes an oral application, such applications are subject to andSection;226.5a,specifically andSection;226.5a(d).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. <T3>General purpose applications.</T3> The requirements of this sectiondo not apply to general purpose applications unless the application, ormaterial accompanying it, indicates that it can be used to open a creditor charge card account.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>5a(a)(5) Certain fees that vary by State.</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. <T3>Method of disclosing range.</T3> If the card issuer discloses a rangeof fees instead of disclosing the amount of the fee imposed in each state,the range may be stated as zero (for states where no fee applies) to theamount of the highest authorized fee.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>5a(b) Required disclosures.</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>5a(b)(1) Annual percentage rate.</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. <T3>Periodic rate.</T3> The periodic rate, expressed as such, may be disclosedin addition to the required disclosure of the corresponding annual percentagerate.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. <T3>Variable-rate accounts_definition.</T3> For purposes of andSection; 226.5a(b)(1),a variable-rate account exists when rate changes are part of the plan andare tied to an index or formula.

For variable-ratedisclosures for telephone applications and solicitations subject to andSection;226.5a(d), the card issuer must use the rate in effect at the time thedisclosures are provided. For oral disclosures under andSection; 226.5a(d)(1),this requires providing the annual percentage rate currently in effect.For the alternate disclosures under andSection; 226.5a(d)(2), this requiresproviding the annual percentage rate in effect at the time the disclosuresare mailed or delivered.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. <T3>Variable-rate accounts_other disclosures.</T3> In describing how theapplicable rate will be determined, the card issuer may identify the indexor formula and disclose any margin or spread added to the index or formulain setting the rate. The card issuer may disclose the margin or spreadas a range of the highest and lowest margins that may be applicable tothe account. A disclosure of any applicable limitations on rate increasesor decreases may also be included.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">5. <T3>Introductory rates_discounted rates.</T3> If the initial rate is atemporary rate and is lower than the rate that will apply after the temporaryrate expires, the card issuer must disclose the annual percentage ratethat would otherwise apply to the account. In a fixed-rate account, thecard issuer must disclose the rate that will apply after the introductoryrate expires. In a variable-rate account, the card issuer must disclosea rate based on the index or formula applicable to the account in accordancewith comment 5a(b)(1)-2. An initial discounted rate may be provided alongwith the rate required to be disclosed if the card issuer also disclosesthe time period during which the introductory rate will remain in effect.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">6. <T3>Introductory rates_premium rates.</T3> If the initial rate is temporaryand is higher than the permanently applicable rate, the card issuer mustdisclose the initial rate.

A membership fee to join an organizationthat provides a credit or charge card as a privilege of membership mustbe disclosed only if the card is issued automatically upon membership.Such a fee need not be disclosed if membership results merely in eligibilityto apply for an account.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. <T3>Enhancements.</T3> Fees for optional services addition to basic membershipprivileges in a credit or charge card account (for example, travel insuranceor card registration services) need not be disclosed under this paragraphif the basic account may be opened without paying such fees.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. <T3>One-time fees.</T3> Disclosure of non-periodic fees is limited to feesrelated to opening the account, such as one-time membership fees. Therefore,the following need not be disclosed:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Fees for reissuing a lost or stolen card</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Statement reproduction fees</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Application fees described in andSection; 226.4(c)(1)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. <T3>Waived or reduced fees.</T3> If fees required to be disclosed are waivedor reduced for a limited time, the introductory fees or the fact of feewaivers may be provided in addition to the required fees if the card issueralso discloses how long the fees or waivers will remain in effect.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">5. <T3>Fees stated as annual amount.</T3> Fees imposed periodically must bestated as an annual total. For example, if a fee is imposed quarterly,the disclosures would state the total amount of the fees for one year.(See, however, the commentary to andSection; 226.9(e) with regard to disclosureof such fees in renewal notices.)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>5a(b)(4) Transaction charges.</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. <T3>Charges imposed by person other than card issuer.</T3> Charges imposedby a third party, such as a seller of goods, would not be disclosed underthis section; the third party would be responsible for disclosing the chargeunder andSection;226.9(d)(1).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>4a(b)(5) Grace period.</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. <T3>How disclosure is made.</T3> The card issuer may, but need not, referto the beginning or ending point of any grace period and briefly stateany conditions on the applicability of the grace period. For example, thegrace period disclosure might read ``30 days'' or ``30 days from the dateof the periodiic statement (provided you have paid your previous balancein full by the due date).''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>5a(b)(6) Balance computation method.</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. <T3>Form of disclosure.</T3> In cases where the card issuer uses a balancecomputation method that is not identified by name in the regulation, thedisclosure should clearly explain the method in as much detail as set forthin the descriptions of balance methods in andSection;226.5a(g). The explanationneed not be as detailed as that required for the disclosures under andSection;226.6(a)(3).(See the commentary to andSection;226.5a(g) for guidance on particular methods.)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. <T3>Determining the method.</T3> In determining the appropriate balancecomputation method for purchases for disclosure purposes, the card issuermust assume that a purchase balance will exist at the end of any graceperiod. Thus, for example, if the average daily balance method will includenew purchases or cover two billing cycles only if purchase balances arenot paid within the grace period, the card issuer would disclose the nameof the average daily balance method but includes new purchases or coverstwo billing cycles, respectively. The card issuer should not assume theexistence of purchase balance, however, in making other disclosures underandSection;226.5a(b).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>5a(b)(7) Statement on charge card payments.</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. <T3>Applicability and content.</T3> The disclosure that charges are payableupon receipt of the periodic statement is applicable only to charge cardaccounts. In making this disclosure, the card issuer may make such modificationsas necessary to more accurately reflect the circumstances of repaymentunder the account. For example, the disclosure might read, ``Charges aredue and payable upon receipt of the periodic statement and must be paidno later than 15 days after receipt of such statement.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>5a(b)(8) Cash advance fee.</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. <T3>Applicability.</T3> The card issuer must disclose only those fees fora cash advance on a credit or charge card account that are finance chargesunder andSection;226.4. For example, a charge for a cash advance at an automatedteller machine (ATM) would be disclosed under andSection;226.5a(b)(8) ifno charge is imposed for ATM transactions not involving an extension ofcredit. (See comment 4(a)-5 for a description of such a fee.) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>5a(b)(9) Late payment fee. </T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. <T3>Applicability.</T3> The disclosure of the fee for a late payment includesonly those fees that will be imposed for actual, unanticipated late payments.(See the commentary to andSection;226.4(c)(2) for additional guidance onlate payment fees.) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>5a(b)(10) Over-the-limit fee. </T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. <T3>Applicability.</T3> The disclosure of fees for exceeding a credit limitdoes not include fees for other types of default or for services relatedto exceeding the limit. For example, no disclosure is required of feesfor reinstating credit privileges or fees for the dishonor of checks onan account that, if paid, would cause the credit limit to be exceeded.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>5a(c) Direct mail applications and solicitations. </T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. <T3>Coverage.</T3> Applications and solicitations contained in catalogs,magazines, or other generally available publications mailed to consumersare subject to the requirements applicable to ``take-ones'' in andSection;226.5a(e),rather than the direct mail requirements of andSection;226.5a(c). A publicationmailed to a limited list of addresses, however (for example, a catalogtargeted to certain types of consumers based on prescreening), is not a``generally available'' publication and therefore is subject to the directmail rules. In addition, if a card issuer has a single application formthat is sometimes used as a ``take-one'' (in racks in public locations,for example) and at other times mailed to consumers, the form is subjectto andSection;226.5a(c) when sent by direct mail and to andSection;226.5a(e)when placed in public locations. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. <T3>Accuracy.</T3> In general, disclosures in direct mail applicationsand solicitations must be accurate as of the time of mailing. See andSection;226.5a(b)(1)(ii),however, for special rules concerning the accuracy of the annual percentagerate disclosure on a variable-rate account. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>5a(d) Telephone applications and solicitations. </T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. <T3>Coverage.</T3> This paragraph applies if: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; A telephone conversation between a card issuer and consumermay result in the issuance of a card as a consequence of an issuer-initiatedoffer to open an account for which the issuer does not require any application(that is, a ``preapproved'' telephone solicitation). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; The card issuer initiates the contact and at the same timetakes application information over the telephone. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This paragraph does not apply to: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Telephone applications initiated by the consumer. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Situations where no card will be issued_because, for example,the consumer indicates that he or she does not want the card, or the cardissuer decides either during the telephone conversation or later not toissue the card. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>5a(e) Applications and solicitations made available to general public.</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. <T3>Coverage.</T3> Applications and solicitations made available to thegeneral public include what are commonly referred to as ``take-one'' applicationstypically found at counters in banks and retail establishments, as wellas applications contained in catalogs, magazines and other generally availablepublications. In the case of credit unions, this paragraph applies to applicationsand solicitations to open card accounts made available to those in thegeneral field of membership. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. <T3>Cross-selling.</T3> If a card issuer invites a consumer to apply fora credit or charge card (for example, where the issuer engages in cross-selling),an application provided to the consumer at the consumer's request is notconsidered an application made available to the general public and thereforeis not subject to andSection;226.5a(e). For example, the following are notcovered. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; A consumer applies in person for a card loan at a financialinstitution and the loan officer invites the consumer to apply for a creditor charge card account; the consumer accepts the invitation. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; An employee of a retail establishment, in the course of processinga sales transaction using a bank credit card, asks a customer if he orshe would like to apply for the retailer's credit or charge card; the customerresponds affirmatively. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. <T3>Toll-free telephone number.</T3> If a card issuer, in complying withany of the disclosure options of andSection;226.5a(e), provides a telephonenumber for consumers to call to obtain credit information, the number mustbe toll-free for nonlocal calls made from an area code other than the oneused in the card issuer's dialing area.

If, however, the card issuer in complyingwith this paragraph provides all the applicable disclosures required underandSection;226.6, in a form that the consumer may keep and in accordancewith the other requirements for that section, the issuer will have satisfiedthe initial disclosure requirements under andSection;226.6 as well as thedisclosure requirements for andSection;226.5a(e)(2). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>5a(e)(3) No disclosure of credit information. </T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. <T3>When disclosure option available.</T3> A card issuer may use this optiononly if the issuer does not include on or with the application or solicitationany statement that refers to the credit disclosures required by andSection;226.5a(b).Statements such as ``no annual fee,'' ``low interest rate,'' ``favorablerates,'' and ``low costs'' are deemed to refer to the required credit disclosuresand, therefore, may not be included on or with the solicitation or applications,if the card issuer chooses to use this option. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>5a(e)(4) Prompt response to requests for information. </T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. <T3>Prompt disclosure.</T3> Information is promptly disclosed if it isgiven within 30 days of a consumer's request for information but in noevent later than delivery of the credit or charge card. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. <T3>Information disclosed.</T3> When a consumer requests credit information,card issuers need not provide all the required credit disclosures in allinstances. For example, if disclosures have been provided in accordancewith andSection;226.5a(e)(1) or (2), and a consumer calls or writes a cardissuer to obtain information about changes in the disclosures, the issuerneed only provide the items of information that have changed from thosepreviously disclosed on or with the application or solicitation. If a consumerrequests information about particular items, the card issuer need onlyprovide the requested information. If, however, the card issuer has madedisclosures in accordance with the option in andSection;226.5a(e)(3), anda consumer calls or writes the card issuer requesting information aboutcosts, all the required disclosure information must be given. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. <T3>Manner of response.</T3> A card issuer's response to a consumer's requestfor credit information may be provided orally or in writing, regardlessof the manner in which the consumer's request is received by the issuer.Furthermore, the card issuer may provide the information listed in eitherandSection;226.5a(e)(1) or (2).

This is the case even though the creditor offeringthe open-end credit plan may be considered an agent of the charge cardissuer (See comment 2(a)(7)-1.) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. <T3>Form of disclosures.</T3> The disclosures required by andSection;226.5a(f)may appear either in or outside the table containing the required creditdisclosures, in circumstances where tabular format is required. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>5a(g) Balance computation methods defined. </T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. <T3>Daily balance method.</T3> Card issuers using the daily balance methodmay disclose it using the name ``average daily balance (including new purchases)''or ``average daily balance (excluding new purchases),'' as appropriate.Alternatively, such card issuers may explain the method. (See comment 7(e)-5for a discussion of the daily balance method.) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. <T3>Two-cycle average daily balance methods.</T3> The ``two-cycle averagedaily balance'' methods described in andSection;226.5a(g)(2)(i) and (ii)include those methods in which the balances for two billing cycles maybe added together to compute the finance charge. The method is a ``two-cycleaverage daily balance'' even if the finance charge will be based on boththe current and prior cycle balances only under certain circumstances,such as when purchases during a prior cycle were carried over into thecurrent cycle and no finance charge was assessed during the prior cycle.Furthermore, the method is a ``two-cycle average daily balance method''if the balances for both the current and prior cycles are average dailybalances, even if those balances are figured differently. For example,the name ``two-cycle average daily balance (excluding new purchases)''should be used to describe a method in which the finance charge for thecurrent cycle, figured as an average daily balance excluding new purchases,will be added to the finance charge for the prior cycle, figured as anaverage daily balance of only new purchases during that prior cycle.andCx.21;</ITAG>7.

(Seethe commentary to andSection;226.3(a), which discusses whether transactionsare consumer or business-purpose credit, for guidance on whether a homeequity plan is subject to Regulation Z.) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. <T3>Disclosure of repayment phase_applicability of requirements.</T3> Someplans provide in the initial agreement for a period during which no furtherdraws may be taken and repayment of the amount borrowed is made. All ofthe applicable disclosures in this section must be given for the repaymentphase. Thus, for example, creditors must provide payment information aboutthe repayment phase as well as about the draw period, as required by andSection;226.5b(d)(5).If the rate that will apply during the repayment phase is fixed at a knownamount, the creditor must provide an APR under andSection;226.5b(d)(6) withregard to that phase. If, however, a creditor uses an index to determinethe rate that will apply at the time of conversion_even if the rate duringthe repayment phase will be fixed_creditors must provide the informationin andSection;226.5b(d)(12), as applicable. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. <T3>Disclosure of repayment phase_timing options.</T3> Creditors have achoice about when the disclosure of the terms for the repayment phase maybe given. Creditors may provide the information at the same time the applicationdisclosures for the draw period required by andSection;226.5b are given tothe consumer. As an alternative, creditors may disclose only the basicpayment terms information under andSection;226.5b(d)(5)(i) and (ii) withthe application disclosures, and defer the other disclosures about therepayment phase until the end of the draw period. Disclosures must be basedon the information available at that later time. (See model form G-14C.)In either case, creditors are required to provide information about therepayment phase set forth in andSection;226.6(e)(2). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. <T3>Repayment phase_applicability of closed-end provisions and substantiverules.</T3> Creditors providing disclosures about a repayment phase underandSection;andSection;226.5b and 226.6, whether at the time an applicationis provided or at the end of the draw period, are not required to provideadditional disclosures under Subpart C of the regulation for closed-endcredit. Creditors are required to continue providing periodic statementsunder andSection;226.7 and to comply with the other open-end credit provisionsof subpart B of the regulation, including the substantive provisions inandSection;226.5b(f). If the original home equity plan agreement does notcall for a repayment phase to follow the draw period, and the consumerand creditor later enter into a closed-end agreement to repay the outstandingbalance, the creditor must give closed-end credit disclosures pursuantto subpart C. In such cases, the open-end provisions in subpart B, includingthe substantive rules, do not apply to the closed-end credit transaction.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">5. <T3>Spreader clause.</T3> When a creditor holds a mortgage or deed of truston the consumer's dwelling and that mortgage or deed of trust containsa ``spreader clause'' (also known as a ``dragnet'' or cross-collateralizationclause), subsequent occurrences such as the opening of a plan are subjectto the rules applicable to home equity plans to the same degree as if asecurity interest were taken directly to secure the open-end plan, unlessthe creditor effectively waives its security interest under the spreaderclause with respect to the subsequent open-end credit extensions. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>5b(a) Form of disclosures.</T3> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>5b(a)(1) General.</T3> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. <T3>Written disclosures.</T3> The disclosures required under this sectionmust be clear and conspicuous and in writing, but need not be in a formthe consumer can keep.

For example, if the creditor offersseveral payment options, all such options must be disclosed. (See, however,the commentary to andSection; 226.5b(d)(5)(iii), andSection; 226.5b(d)(12)(x),and andSection; 226.5b(d)(12)(xi) for disclosure requirements relating tothese provisions.) If any aspects of a plan are linked together, the creditormust disclose clearly the relationship of the terms to each other. Forexample, if the consumer can only obtain a particular payment option inconjunctions with a certain variable-rate feature, this fact must be disclosed.A creditor has the option of providing separate disclosure forms for multipleoptions or variations in features. For example, a creditor that offersdifferent payment options for the draw period has the option of creatingseparate disclosure forms for the two payment options. The creditor usingthis alternative, however, must include a statement on each disclosureform that the consumer should ask about the creditor's other home equityprograms. This disclosure is required only for those programs generallyavailable to the public. Thus, if the only other programs available areemployees preferred-rate plans, for example, the creditor would not haveto provide this statement. A creditor who receives a request for informationabout other available programs must provide the additional disclosuresas soon as reasonably possible.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>5b(a)(2) Precedence of Certain Disclosures.</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1.<T3> Precedence rule. </T3>The list of conditions provided at the creditor'soption under andSection; 226.5b(d)(4)(iii) need not precede the other disclosures.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>5b(b) time of disclosures.</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1.<T3> Mail and telephone applications.</T3> If the creditor sends applicationsthrough the mail, the disclosures and a brochure must accompany the application.If an application is taken over the telephone, the disclosures and brochuremay be delivered or mailed within three business days of taking the application.If an application is mailed to the consumer following a telephone request,however, the creditor also must send the disclosures and a brochure alongwith the application.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2.<T3> General purpose applications.</T3> the disclosures and a brochureneed not be provided when a general purpose application is given to a consumerunless the application or materials accompanying it indicate that it canbe used to apply for a home equity plan. In all cases where an applicationis provided in response to a consumer's specific inquiry about a home equityplan, the disclosures and a brochure must accompany the application.

If, however, a creditor providesthe third party with disclosures along with its application form, the thirdparty must give the disclosures to the consumer with the application form.If an intermediary agent or broker takes an application over the telephoneor receives an application contained in a magazine or other publication,footnote 10a permits such a person to mail the disclosures and brochurewithin three business days of receipt of the application.

The relevant items must bedistinguished from the other information contained in the document. Forexample, the creditor may provide a cover sheet that specifically pointsout which contract provisions contain the information, or may mark therelevant items on the document itself. As an alternative to disclosingthe conditions in this manner, the creditor may simply describe the conditionsusing the language in andSection; 226.5b(f)(2) and andSection; 226.5b(f)(3)(vi).In describing specified changes that may be implemented during the plan,the creditor may provide a disclosure such as: ``Our agreement permitsus to make certain changes to the terms of the line at specified timesor upon the occurrence of specified events.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2.<T3> Form of disclosure. </T3>The list of conditions under andSection; 226.5b(d)(4)(iii)may appear with the segregated disclosures or apart from them.

For example, if an agreementprovides that the draw period is five years and that the creditor may renewthe draw period for an additional five years, the possibility of renewalshould be ignored and the draw period should be considered five years.(See the commentary accompanying andSection; 226.9(c)(1) dealing with changein terms requirements.)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">Paragraph 5b(d)(5)(ii)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1.<T3> Determination of the minimum periodic payment.</T3> This disclosuremust reflect how the minimum periodic payment is determined, but need onlydescribe the principal and interest components of the payment. Other chargesthat may be part of the payment (as well as the balance computation method)may, but need not, be described under this provision.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2.<T3> Fixed rate and term payment options during draw period.</T3> If thehome equity plan permits the consumer to pay off all or part of the balanceduring the draw period at a fixed rate (rather than a variable rate) andover a specified time period, this feature must be disclosed. To illustrate,a variable-rate plan may permit a consumer to elect during a ten-year drawperiod to repay all or a portion of the balance over a three-year periodat a fixed rate. The creditor must disclose the rules relating to thisfeature including the period during which the option can be selected, thelength of time over which repayment can occur, any fees imposed for sucha feature, and the specific rate or the index and margin that will applyupon exercise of this choice. For example, the rate disclosure might state,``If you choose to convert any portion of your balance to a fixed rate,the rate will be the highest prime rate published in the ``Wall StreetJournal'' that is in effect at the date of conversion plus 2 percentagepoints.'' If the fixed rate is to be determined according to an index,it must be one that is outside the creditor's control and is publicly availablein accordance with andSection; 26.5b(f)(1). The effect of exercising theoption should not be reflected elsewhere in the disclosures, such as inthe historical example required in andSection; 26.5b(d)(12)(xi).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3.<T3> Balloon payments.</T3> In programs where the occurrence of a balloonpayment is uncertain or unlikely but possible, the creditor must disclosethe possibility of a balloon payment. In such cases, the disclosure mightread, ``Your minimum payment may not fully repay the principal outstandingon your line. You may be required to pay the entire outstanding balancein a single payment.'' In programs where a balloon payment will occur,such as programs with interest-only payments during the draw period andno repayment period, the disclosures must reflect that fact. For example,the disclosure might read, ``Your minimum payment will not fully repaythe principal that is outstanding on your line. You will be required topay the entire outstanding balance in a single payment.'' In making thisdisclosure, the creditor is not required to use the term ``balloon payment.''The creditor also is not required to disclose the amount of the balloonpayment. (See, however, the requirement under andSection;226.5b(d)(5)(iii).)The balloon payment disclosure does not apply in cases where repaymentof the entire outstanding balance would occur only as a result of terminationand acceleration. The creditor also need not make a disclosure about balloonpayments if the final payment could not be more than twice the amount ofother minimum payments under the plan.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">Paragraph 5b(d)(5)(iii)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1.<T3> Minimum periodic payment example. </T3>In disclosing the payment example,the creditor may assume that the credit limit as well as the outstandingbalance is $10,000 if such an assumption is relevant to calculating payments.(If the creditor only offers lines of credit for less than $10,000, thecreditor may assume an outstanding balance of $5,000 instead of $10,000in making this disclosure.) The example should reflect the payment comprisedonly of principal and interest, and can assume that all months have anequal number of days. Creditors may provide an additional example reflectingother charges which may be included in the payment, such as credit insurancepremiums. For variable-rate plans, this example must be based on the lastrate in the historical example required in andSection; 226.5b(d)(12)(xi),or a more recent rate. A discounted rate may not be considered a more recentrate in calculating this payment example for either variable- or fixed-rateplans. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. <T3>Representative examples. </T3>In plans that have multiple payment optionswithin the draw period or within any repayment period, the creditor mayprovide representative examples as an alternative to providing examplesfor each payment option. The creditor may elect to provide representativepayment examples based on three categories of payment options. The firstcategory consists of plans that permit minimum payment of only accruedfinance charges (``interest only'' plans). The second category includesplans in which a fixed percentage or a fixed fraction of the outstandisngbalance or credit limit (for example, 2 percent of the balance of 1/180thof the balance) is used to determine the minimum payment. The third categoryincludes all other types of minimum payment options, such as a specifieddollar amount plus any accrued finance charges. Creditors may classifytheir minimum payment arrangements within one of these three categorieseven if other features exist, such as varying lengths of a draw or repaymentperiod, required payment of past due amounts, late charges and minimumdollar amounts. The creditor may use a single example within each categoryto represent the payment options in that category. For example, if a creditorpermits minimum payments of 1%, 2%, 3% or 4% of the outstanding balance,it may pick one of these four options and provide the example requiredunder andSection; 226.5b(d)(5)(iii) for that option alone. The example usedto represent a category must be an option commonly chosen by consumers,or a typical or representative example. (See the commentary to andSection;226.5b(d)(12)(x) and andSection; 226.5b(d)(12)(xi) for a discussion of theuse of representative examples for making those disclosures. Creditorschoosing to use a representative example within each category must usethe same example for purposes of the disclosure under andSection; 226.5b(d)(5)(iii),andSection; 226.5b(d)(12)(x), and andSection; 226.5b(d)(12)(xi).) Separateexamples must be given for the draw and repayment periods unless the paymentsare determined the same way during both periods. In setting forth paymentexamples for any repayment period under this section (and the historicalexample under andSection; 226.5b(d)(12)(xi)), creditors should assume a $10,000advance is taken at the beginning of the draw period and is reduced accordingto the terms of the plan. Creditors should not assume an additional advanceis taken at any time, including at the beginning of any repayment period.Creditors may use representative examples under andSection; 226.5b(d)(5)only with respect to the payment example required under paragraph (d)(5)(iii).Creditors must provide a full narrative description of all payment optionsunder andSection; 226.5b(d)(5) (i) and (ii). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. <T3>Reverse mortgages. </T3>Reverse mortages, also known as reverse annuityor home equity conversion mortgages, in addition to permitting the consumerto obtain advances, may involve the disbursement of monthly advances tothe consumer for a fixed period or until the occurrence of an event suchas the consumer's death. Repayment of the reverse mortgage (generally asingle payment of principal and accrued interest) may be required to bemade at the end of the disbursements or, for example, upon the death ofthe consumer. In disclosing these plans, creditors must apply the followingrules, as applicable:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; If the reverse mortgage has a specified period for drawsand disbursements but repayment is due only upon occurrence of a futureevent such as the death of the consumer, the creditor must assume thatdisbursements will be made until they are scheduled to end. The creditormust assume repayment will occur when disbursements end (or within a periodfollowing the final disbursement which is not longer than the regular intervalbetween disbursements). This assumption should be used even though repaymentmay occur before or after the disbursements are scheduled to end. In suchcases, the creditor may include a statement such as ``The disclosures assumethat you will repay the line at the time the draw period and our paymentsto you end. As provided in your agreement, your repayment may be requiredat a different time.'' The single payment should be considered the ``minimumperiodic payment'' and consequently would not be treated as a balloon payment.The example of the minimum payment under andSection; 226.5b(d)(5)(iii) shouldassume a single $10,000 draw. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; If the reverse mortgage has neither a specified period foradvances or disbursements nor a specified repayment date and these termswill be determined solely by reference to future events, including theconsumer's death, the creditor may assume that the draws and disbursementswill end upon the consumer's death (estimated by using actuarial tables,for example) and that repayment will be required at the same time (or withina period following the date of the final disbursement which is not longerthan the regular interval for disbursements). Alternatively, the creditormay base the disclosures upon another future event it estimates will bemost likely to occur first. (If terms will be determined by reference tofuture events which do not include the consumer's death, the creditor mustbase the disclosures upon the occurrence of the event estimated to be mostlikely to occur first.)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; In making the disclosures, the creditor must assume thatall draws and disbursements and accrued interest will be paid by the consumer.For example, if the note has a non-recourse provision providing that theconsumer is not obligated for an amount greater than the value of the house,the creditor must nonetheless assume that the full amount to be drawn ordisbursed will be repaid. In this case, however, the creditor may includea statement such as ``The disclosures assume full repayment of the amountadvanced plus accrued interest, although the amount you may be requiredto pay is limited by your agreement.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Some reverse mortgages provide that some or all of the appreciationin the value of the property will be shared between the consumer and thecreditor. The appreciation feature must be disclosed in accordance withandSection; 226.5b(d)(12).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">5b(d)(6) Annual Percentage Rate</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. <T3>Preferred-rate plans.</T3> If a creditor offers a preferential fixed-rateplan in which the rate will increase a specified amount upon the occurrenceof a specified event, the creditor must disclose the specific amount therate will increase.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">5b(d)(7) Fees Imposed by Creditor</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. <T3>Applicability.</T3> The fees referred to in andSection; 226.5b(d)(7)include items such as application fees, points, annual fees, transactionfees, and fees imposed for converting to the repayment phase provided forin the original agreement. This disclosure includes any fees that are imposedby the creditor to use or maintain the plan even if such fees are passedon by the creditor to a third party. For example, if a creditor annuallyobtains a credit report on the consumer and requires the consumer to paythis fee to the creditor or directly to the third party, the fee must bespecifically stated. Third party fees to open the plan that are initiallypaid by the consumer to the creditor may be included in this disclosureor in the disclosures under andSection; 226.5b(d)(8).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. <T3>Manner of describing fees.</T3> Charges may be stated as an estimateddollar amount for each fee, or as a percentage of a typical or representativeamount of credit. The creditor may provide a stepped fee schedule in whicha fee will increase a specified amount at a specified date. (See the discussioncontained in the commentary to andSection; 226.5b(f)(3)(i).)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. <T3>Fees not required to be disclosed.</T3> Fees imposed for late payment,stopping payment, returned checks, exceeding the credit limit, or closingout an account do not have to be disclosed under this section. Credit reportand appraisal fees imposed to investigate whether a condition permittinga freeze continues to exist_as discussed under andSection; 226.5b(f)(3)(vi)_arenot required to be disclosed under this section or andSection; 226.5b(d)(8).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. <T3>Rebates of closing costs.</T3> If closing costs are imposed they mustbe disclosed, regardless of whether such costs may be rebated later (forexample, rebated to the extent of any interest paid during the first yearof the plan).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">5b(d)(8) Fees Imposed by Third Parties to Open a Plan</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. <T3>Applicability.</T3> Section 226.5b(d)(8) applies only to fees imposedby third parties to open the plan. Thus, for example, this section doesnot require disclosure of a fee imposed by a government agency at the endof a plan to release a security interest. Fees to be disclosed includeappraisal, credit report, government agency, and attorney fees as wellas premiums for property insurance required by the creditor.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. <T3>Itemization of third party fees.</T3> In all cases creditors must statethird party fees as a single dollar amount or a range. A creditor has twooptions with regard to providing more detailed information about thirdparty fees. Creditors may provide a statement that the consumer may requestmore specific cost information about third party fees from the creditor.Upon receiving a consumer's request for such an itemization prior to theconsumer opening the plan, the creditor must provide the information assoon as reasonably possible. As an alternative to including this statement,creditors may provide an itemization of such fees (by type and amount)with the early disclosures.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. <T3>Manner of describing fees.</T3> A good faith estimate of the amountof fees msut be provided.

Rate limitationsimposed on less than an annual basis must be stated in terms of a specificamount of time. For example, if the creditor imposes rate limitations ononly a semiannual basis, this must be expressed as a six-month time period.If the creditor does not impose periodic limits (annual or shorter) onrate increases, the fact that there are no annual rate limitations mustbe stated.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. <T3>Maximum limitations on increases in rates.</T3> The maximum annualpercentage rate that may be imposed under each payment option over theterm of the plan (including the draw period and any repayment period providedfor in the initial agreement) must be provided. The creditor may disclosethis rate as a specific number (for example, 18 percent) or as a specificamount above the initial rate. For example, this disclosure might read,``The maximum annual percentage rate that can apply to your line will be5 percentage points above your initial rate.'' If the creditor states themaximum rate as a specific amount above the initial rate, the creditormust include a statement that the consumer should inquire about the ratelimitations that are currently available. If an initial discount is nottaken into account in applying maximum rate limitations, that fact mustbe disclosed. If separate overall limitations apply to rate increases resultingfrom events such as the exercise of a fixed-rate conversion option or leavingthe creditor's employ, those limitation also must be stated. Limitationsdo not include legal limits in the nature of usury or rate ceilings understate or federal statutes or regulations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. <T3>Form of disclosures. </T3>The creditor need not disclose each periodicor maximum rate limitation that is currently available. Instead, the creditormay disclose the range of the lowest and highest periodic and maximum ratelimitations that may be applicable to the creditor's home equity plans.Creditors using this alternative must include a statement that the consumershould inquire about the rate limitations that are currently available.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">Paragraph 5b(d)(12)(x)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. <T3>Maximum rate payment example.</T3> In calculating the payment creditorsshould assume the maximum rate is in effect. Any discounted or premiuminitial rates or periodic rate limitations should be ignored for purposesof this disclosure. If a range is used to disclosure the maximum cap underandSection; 226.5b(d)(12)(ix), the highest rate in the range must be usedfor this disclosure. As an alternative to making disclosures based on eachpayment option, the creditor may choose a representative example withinthe three categories of payment options upon which to base this disclosure.(See the commentary to andSection; 226.5b(d)(5).) However, separate examplesmust be provided for the draw period and for any repayment period unlessthe payment is determined the same way in both periods. Creditors shouldcalculate the example for the repayment period based on an assumed $10,000balance. (See the commentary to andSection; 226.5b(d)(5) for a discussionof the circumstances in which a creditor may use a lower outstanding balance.)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. <T3>Time the maximum rate could be reached.</T3> In stating the date ortime by which the maximum rate could be reached creditors should assumethe rate increases as rapidly as possible under the plan. In calculatingwhen this date or time could be reached, creditors should factor in anydiscounted or premium initial rates or periodic rate limitations. Thisdisclosure must be provided for the draw phase and any repayment phase.In calculating this disclosure for the draw and any repayment phase, creditorsshould assume the index and margin shown in the last year of the historicalexample (or a more recent rate) is in effect at the beginning of each phase.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Paragraph 5b(d)(12)(xi)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. <T3>Index values.</T3> Index values and annual percentage rates must beshown for the entire 15 years of the historical example and must be basedon the most recent 15 years. The example must be updated annually to reflectthe most recent 15 years of index values. If the length of the plan isless than 15 years, payments need only be shown for the number of yearsin the term, though all significant plan terms such as rate limitationsmust be shown for the entire 15 years. If the values for an index havenot been available for 15 years, a creditor need only go back as far asthe values have been available in giving a history and payment exampleand may start the example at the year for which values are first available.The creditor should assume that the $10,000 balance is an advance takenat the beginning of the first billing cycle and is reduced according tothe terms of the plan, and that the consumer takes no subsequent draws.As discussed in the commentary to andSection; 226.5b(d)(5), creditors shouldnot assume an additional advance is taken at the beginning of any repaymentperiod. If applicable, the creditor may assume the $10,000 is both theadvance and the credit limit. (See the commentary to andSection; 226.5b(d)(5)for a discussion of the circumstances in which a creditor may use a loweroutstanding balance.)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. <T3>Selection of index values.</T3> The historical example must reflectthe method of choosing index values for the plan. For example, if an averageof index values is used in the plan, averages would be used in the history,but if an index value as of a particular date is used, a single index valuewould be shown. The creditor is required to assume one date within a year(or one period, if an average is used) on which to base the history ofindex values for each loan plan. The creditor may choose to use index valuesas of any date or period as long as the index value as of this date orperiod is used for each year in the index history. Only one index valueper year need be shown, even if the plan provides for adjustments to theannual percentage rate or payment more than once in a year. In such cases,the creditor can assume that the index rate remained constant for the fullyear for the purpose of calculating the annual percentage rate and payment.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. <T3>Calculation of payments.</T3> The payment figures in the historicalexample must reflect all significant program terms. For example, featuressuch as rate and payment caps, a discounted initial rate, negative amortization,and rate carryover must be taken into account in calculating the paymentfigures if these would have applied to the plan. A creditor need show onlyone payment per year in the example, even though payments may vary duringa year. (The calculations should be based on the actual payment computationformula, although the creditor may assume that all months have an equalnumber of days.) The creditor may assume that payments are made on thelast day of the billing cycle, the billing date or the payment due date,but must be consistent in the manner in which the period used to illustratepayment information is selected. Information about balloon payments may,but need not, be reflected in the example.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. <T3>Representatives payment options.</T3> The creditor need not providean historical example for all of its various payment options, but may selecta representative payment option within each of the three categories ofpayments upon which to base its disclosure. (See the commentary to andSection;226.5(d)(5).)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">5. <T3>Reverse mortgages.</T3> The historical example for reverse mortgageswould reflect 15 years of index values and annual percentage rates, butthe payment column would be blank until the year that the single paymentwill be made, assuming that payment is estimated to occur within 15 years.(See the commentary to andSection; 226.5(d)(5) for a discussion of reversemortgages.)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">6. <T3>Rate limitations.</T3> Both periodic and maximum rate limitations mustbe reflected in the historical example, If ranges of rate limitations areprovided under andSection; 226.5(d)(120(ix), the highest periodic and maximumrates provided in those ranges must be used in the example. Rate limitationsthat may apply more often than annual should be treated as if they areannual limitations. For example, if a creditor imposes a 1% cap every sixmonths, this should be reflected in the example as if it were a 2 percentannual cap.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">7. <T3>Selection of margin.</T3> A value for the margin must be assumed inorder to prepare the example. A creditor must select a representative marginthat it has used with the index during the six months preceding preparationof the disclosures and state that the margin is one that it has used recently.The margin selected may be used until the creditor annually updates thedisclosure form to reflect the most recent 15 years of index values.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">8. <T3>Amount of discount or premium. </T3>In reflecting any discounted orpremium initial rate, the creditor may select a discount or premium thathas been used during the six months preceding preparation of the disclosures,and should disclose that the discount or premium is one that the creditorhas used recently. The discount or premium should be reflected in the examplefor as long as it is in effect. The creditor may assume that a discountor premium that would have been in effect for any part of a year was ineffect for the full year for purposes of reflecting it in the historicalexample.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">9. <T3>Disclosures for repayment period. </T3>In providing the historicalexample, creditors that choose to provide disclosures about the repaymentperiod as part of the disclosures provided with an application (see thecommentary to andSection; 226.5b for a discussion of the options availableon the giving of such disclosures) must reflect all features of the repaymentperiod in the table, including the appropriate index values, margin, ratelimitations, length of the repayment period, and payments. For example,if different indices are used during the draw and repayment periods, theindex values for that portion of the 15 years that reflect the repaymentperiod must be the values for the appropriate index. Creditors that chooseto provide information about the repayment period at the end of the drawperiod, rather than with the application disclosures, need not reflectthe repayment period in the example (just as they may omit informationabout the repayment period for purposes of the disclosures under andSection;226.5b(d)(12) generally). In such cases, the index values and annual percentagerates relating to the draw period would be shown for the entire 15 years(even if the draw period is less than 15 years).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">5b(e) Brochure</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. <T3>Substitutes. </T3>A brochure is a suitable substitute for the Board'shome equity brochure if it is, at a minimum, comparable to the Board'sbrochure in substance and comprehensiveness.

The limitations apply tothe draw period and any repayment period, and to any renewal or modificationof the original agreement.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">Paragraph 5b(f)(1)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. <T3>External index. </T3>A creditor may change the annual percentage ratefor a plan only if the change is based on an index outside the creditor'scontrol. Thus, a creditor may not make rate changes based on its own primerate or cost of funds and may not reserve a contractual right to changerates at its discretion. A creditor is permitted, however, to use a publishedprime rate, such as that in the ``Wall Street Journal'', even if the bank'sown prime rate is one of several rates used to establish the publishedrate.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. <T3>Publicly available. </T3>The index must be available to the public.A publicly available index need not always be published in a newspaper,but it must be one the consumer can independently obtain and use to verifyrates imposed under the plan.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. <T3>Provisions not prohibited. </T3>This paragraph does not prohibit ratechanges that are specifically set forth in the agreement. For example,stepped-rate plans, in which specified rates are imposed for specifiedperiods, are permissible. In addition, preferred-rate provisions, in whichthe rate increases by a specified amount upon the occurrence of a specifiedevent, also are permissible.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">Paragraph 5b(f)(2)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. <T3>Limitations on termination and acceleration. </T3>In general, creditorsare prohibited from terminating and accelerating payment of the outstandingbalance before the scheduled expiration of a plan. However, creditors maytake these actions in the three circumstances specified in andSection; 226.5b(f)(2).Creditors are not permitted to specify in their contracts any other eventsthat allow terminating an acocunt or accelerating payment of the outstandingbalance beyond those permitted by the regulation. Thus, for example, anagreement may not provide that the balance is payable on demand nor mayit provide that the account will be terminated and the balance acceleratedif the rate cap is reached.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. <T3>Other actions permitted. </T3>If one of the events permitting terminationand acceleration occurs, a creditor may instead take actions short of terminatingand accelerating. For example, a creditor could suspend further advances,reduce the credit limit, change the payment terms, or require the consumerto pay a fee. A creditor also may provide in its agreement that a higherrate or higher fees will apply in circumstances under which it would otherwisebe permitted to terminate the plan and accelerate the balance. A creditorthat does not immediately terminate an account and accelerate payment ortake another permitted action may take such action at a later time, providedone of the conditions permitting termination and acceleration exists atthat time.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">Paragraph 5b(f)(2)(i)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. <T3>Fraud or material misrepresentation. </T3>A creditor may terminatea plan and accelerate the balance if there has been fraud or material misrepresentationby the consumer in connection with the plan. This exception includes fraudor misrepresentation at any time, either during the application processor during the draw period and any repayment period. What constitutes fraudor misrepresentation is determined by applicable state law and may includeacts of omission as well as overt acts, as long as any necessary intenton the part of the consumer exists.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">Paragraph 5b(f)(2)(ii)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. <T3>Failure to meet repayment terms. </T3>A creditor may terminate a planand accelerate the balance if the consumer has failed to meet the repaymentterms of the agreement. Failure to make payments occurs if the consumerhas not made the payment within 60 days of the payment due date. Failureto make payments also would be deemed to occur if the consumer is in defaultfor failure to make a required payment (as provided for by state or otherapplicable law) and the consumer does not make the payment (plus any applicablelate or deferral charges) within 30 days after a credtior provides a writtennotice of the missed payment and the consequences of continued failureto pay. A creditor may not terminate a plan or accelerate the balance ifthe consumer makes payment of the amount due (the payment plus any lateor deferral charges) within the 30-day period. If the consumer has receivedsuch a notice more than twice in any one-year period, and then does notmake a payment, the creditor may terminate the account and accelerate thebalance without providing an additional written notice. To the extent thatapplicable state law provides that a creditor must send a particular rightto cure notice before terminating a plan and accelerating the balance orprovides for a period longer than 30 days, this provision does not supersedesuch a requirement. Failure to make payments does not occur if, for example,the consumer, in error, sends a payment to the wrong location, such asa branch rather than the main office of the creditor. Filing for bankruptcypermits termination if the consumer fails to make payments under the plan.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">Paragraph 5b(f)(2)(iii)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. <T3>Impairment of security. </T3>A creditor may terminate a plan and acceleratethe balance if the consumer's action or inaction adversely affects thecreditor's security for the plan, or any right of the creditor in thatsecurity. Action or inaction by third parties does not permit the creditorto terminate and accelerate.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. <T3>When permitted. </T3>A creditor may terminate and accelerate, for example,if the consumer transfers title to the property or sells the property withoutthe permission of the creditor, of if the consumer fails to maintain requiredinsurance on the dwelling. A consumer's failure to pay taxes on the propertyor action by the consumer that results in a lien senior to that held bythe creditor also permits the creditor to terminate and accelerate. Deathof the sole consumer obligated on a plan, taking of property through eminentdomain, and foreclosure by a prior lienholder permit termination and acceleration.By contrast, the filing of a judgment against the consumer would permittermination and acceleration only if the amount of the judgment and collateralsubject to the judgment is such that the creditor's security is adverselyaffected. If the consumer commits waste or otherwise destructively usesor fails to maintain the property such that the action adversely affectsthe security, the plan may be terminated. Illegal use of the property bythe consumer would permit termination of the plan if it subjects the propertyto seizure. If the consumer moves out of the dwelling that secures theplan, the creditor may not terminate a plan and accelerate the balanceunless the consumer's action adversely affects the security.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">Paragraph 5b(f)(3)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. <T3>Scope of provision. </T3>In general, a creditor may not change theterms of a plan after it is opened. For example, a creditor may not increaseany fee or impose a new fee once the plan has been opened. The change ofterms prohibition applies to all features of a plan, not only those requiredto be disclosed under the regulation. For example, a creditor may not increasethe margin for a variable-rate plan. This provision also applies to chargesimposed for later payment, for example, though this fee is not requiredto be disclosed under andSection; 226.5b(d)(7).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. <T3>Charges not covered. </T3>There are three charges not covered by thisprovision. A creditor may pass on any increases for property taxes sincesuch charges are imposed by a governmental body and are beyond the controlof the creditor. In addition a creditor may pass on increases in premiumsfor property insurance described in andSection; 226.4(d)92) and increasesin credit insurance premiums described in andSection; 226.4(d)(1), providedsuch increased costs are imposed by a third party.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">Paragraph 5b(f)(3)(i)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. <T3>Changes provided for in agreement. </T3>A creditor may provide in theinitial agreement for specific changes to take place upon the occurrenceof specific events. Both the triggering event and the resulting modificationmust be stated with specificity. For example, in an employee home equityplan, the agreement could provide that a specified higher rate or marginwill apply if the borrower's employment with the creditor ends. A contractalso could contain a stepped-rate or stepped-fee schedule providing forspecified changes in the rate or the fees on certain dates or after a specifiedperiod of time. A creditor also may provide in the initial agreement thatit will be entitled to a share of the appreciation in the value of theproperty as long as the specific appreciation share and the specific circumstanceswhich require the payment of it are set forth. A contract also may permita consumer to switch among minimum payment options during the plan.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. <T3>Prohibited provisions. </T3>A creditor may not include a general provisionin its agreement permitting changes to any or all of the terms of the plan.For example, creditors may not include ``boilerplate'' language in theagreement stating that they reserve the right to change the fees imposedunder the plan. In addition, a creditor may not include any ``triggeringevents'' or responses that the regulation expressly addresses in a mannerdifferent from that provided in the regulation. For example, an agreementmay not provide that the margin in a variable-rate plan will increase ifthere is a material change in the consumer's financial circumstances, becausethe regulation specifies that temporarily freezing the line or loweringthe credit limit is the permissible response to a material change in theconsumer's financial circumstances. Similarly a contract cannot containa provision allowing the creditor to freeze a line due to an insignificantdecrease in property value since the regulation allows that response onlyfor a significant decrease.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">Paragraph 5b(f)(3)(ii)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. <T3>Substitution of index. </T3>A creditor may change the index and marginused under the plan if the original index becomes unavailable, as longas historical fluctuations in the original and replacement indices weresubstantially similar, and as long as the replacement index and marginwill produce a rate similar to the rate that was in effect at the timethe original index became unavailable. If the replacement index is newlyestablished and therefore does not have any rate history, it may be usedif it produces a rate substantially similar to the rate in effect whenthe original index became unavailable.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">Paragraph 5b(f)(3)(iii)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. <T3>Changes by written agreement. </T3>A creditor may change the termsof a plan if the consumer expressly agrees in writing to the change atthe time it is made. For example, a consumer and a creditor could agreein writing to change the repayment terms from interest-only payments topayments that reduce the principal balance. The creditor must comply withthe change in terms notice requirements in andSection; 226.9(c), and theagreement is governed by the limitations in andSection; 226.5b(f). For example,a creditor and consumer could not enter into a subsequent agreement tobase changes in the annual percentage rate on the movement of an indexcontrolled by the creditor. Similarly, an agreement could not specify eventsthat will permit termination and acceleration other than those permittedby the regulation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. <T3>Written agreement. </T3>The change must be agreed to in writing bythe consumer. Creditors are not permitted to assume consent because theconsumer uses an account, even if use of an account constitutes acceptanceof a proposed change under state law.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">Paragraph 5b(f)(3)(iv) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. <T3>Beneficial changes. </T3>Creditors may make changes that unequivocallybenefit the consumer. Under this provision, a creditor may make changesthat offer more options to consumers, as long as existing options remain.For example, a creditor could offer the consumer the option of making lowermonthly payments or could increase the credit limit. Similarly, a creditorcould extend the length of the plan for any period, as long as it was extendedor renewed on the same terms. Creditors are permitted to temporarily reducethe rate or fees charged during the plan (though a change in terms noticemay be required under andSection; 226.9(c) when the rate or fees are returnedto their original level). Creditors also may offer as an option additionalmeans of access to the line even if fees are associated with using thedevice, provided that the consumer retains the ability to use prior accessdevices on the original terms. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">Paragraph 5b(f)(3)(v) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. <T3>Insignificant changes. </T3>A creditor is permitted to make insignificantchanges after a plan is opened. This rule allows accommodation for operationaland similar problems, such as changing the address of the creditor forpurposes of sending payments. It does not permit a creditor to change aterm such as a fee charged for late payments. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. <T3>Examples of Insignificant changes. </T3>Creditors may make minor changesto features such as the billing cycle date, the payment due date (as longas the consumer does not have a diminished grace period if one is provided),and the day of the month on which index values are measured to determinechanges to the rate for variable-rate plans. A creditor also may changeits rounding rules, in accordance with the tolerance rules set forth inandSection; 226.14 (for example, stating an exact APR of 14.3333 percentas 14.3 percent, even if it had previously been stated as 14.33 percent).A creditor may change the balance computation method it uses only if thechange produces an insignifcant difference in the finance charge paid bythe consumer. For example, a creditor may switch from using the averagedaily balance method (including new transactions) to the daily balancemethod (including new transactions). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">Paragraph 5b(f)(3)(vi) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. <T3>Suspension of credit or reduction of credit limit. </T3>A creditormay prohibit additional extensions of credit or reduce the credit limitin seven circumstances. A creditor may not take these actions under othercircumstances, unless the creditor would be permitted to terminate theline and accelerate the balance as described in andSection; 226.5b(f)(2).The creditor's right to reduce the credit limit does not permit reducingthe limit below the amount of the outstanding balance if this would requirethe consumer to make a higher payment. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. <T3>Temporary nature of suspension or reduction. </T3>Creditors are permittedto prohibit additional extensions of credit or reduce the credit limitonly while one of the designated circumstances exists. When the circumstancejustifying the creditor's action ceases to exist, credit privileges mustbe reinstated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. <T3>Imposition of fee. </T3>If permitted by state law, a creditor may collecta bona fide and reasonable fee in connection with actual expenses incurredto investigate whether the condition permitting the freeze continues toexist; a creditor may collect only appraisal and credit report fees. Acreditor may not, in any circumstances, impose a fee to reinstate a creditline once the condition has been determined not to exist. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. <T3>Reinstatement of credit privileges. </T3>Creditors are responsiblefor ensuring that credit privileges are restored as soon as reasonablypossible after the condition that permitted the creditor's action ceasesto exist. A creditor must monitor the line on an ongoing basis to determinewhen the condition ceases to exist. The creditor must investigate the conditionfrequently enough to assure itself that the condition permitting the freezecontinues to exist. The frequency with which the creditor investigatesto determine whether a condition continues to exist depends upon the specificcondition permitting the freeze. As an alternative to such monitoring,the creditor may shift the duty to the consumer to request reinstatementof credit privileges. (See andSection; 226.9(c)(3).) A consumer's requestneed not be in writing. Once the consumer has made such a request, thecreditor must investigate to determine whether the condition allowing thefreeze continues to exist. Under this alternative, the creditor has a dutyto investigate only upon the consumer's request. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">5. <T3>Suspension of credit privileges following request by consumer. </T3>Acreditor may honor a specific request by a consumer to suspend credit privileges.Thus, for example, if two consumers are obligated under a plan and eachhas the ability to take advances, the agreement may permit either of thetwo persons to direct the creditor not to make further advances. If theperson who requested suspension subsequently requests reinstatement ofdraw privileges, the creditor must honor the request for reinstatement.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">6. <T3>Significant decline defined. </T3>What constitutes a significant declinefor purposes of andSection; 226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(A) will vary accordingly toindividual circumstances. In any event, if the value of the dwelling declinessuch that the initial difference between the credit limit and the availableequity (based on the property's appraised value for purposes of the plan)is reduced by fifty percent, this constitutes a significant decline inthe value of the dwelling for purposes of andSection; 226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(A).For example, assume that a house with a first mortgage of $50,000 is appraisedat $100,000 and the credit limit is $30,000. The difference between thecredit limit and the available equity is $20,000, half of which is $10,000.Therefore, the creditor could prohibit further advances or reduce the creditlimit if the value of the property declines from $100,000 to $90,000. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">7. <T3>Material change in financial circumstances. </T3>Two conditions mustbe met for andSection; 226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(B) to apply. First, there must bea ``material change'' in the consumer's financial circumstances, such asa significant decrease in the consumer's income. Second, as a result ofthis change, the creditor must have a reasonable belief that the consumerwill be unable to fulfill the payment obligations of the plan. A creditormay, does not have to, rely on specific evidence (such as the failure topay other debts) in concluding that the second part of the test has beenmet. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">8. <T3>Default of a material obligation. </T3>Creditors may specify eventsthat would qualify as a default of a material obligation under andSection;226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(C). For example, a creditor may provide that default ofa material obligation will exist if the consumer moves out of the dwellingor permits an intervening lien to be filed that would take priority overfuture advances made by the creditor. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">9. <T3>Government limits on the annual percentage rate. </T3>Under andSection;226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(D), a creditor may prohibit further advances or reducethe credit limit if, for example, a state usury law is enacted which prohibitsa creditor from imposing the agreed-upon annual percentage rate.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">10. <T3>Maximum annual percentage rate reached.</T3> Under andSection; 226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(G),a creditor may prohibit further advances or reduce the credit limit duringany period in which the annual percentage rate reaches the maximum rateallowed under the plan. If the annual percentage rate subsequently declinesbelow the maximum rate, the creditor must reinstate credit privileges.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">5b(g) Refund of Fees</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. <T3>Refund of fees required.</T3> If any disclosed term changes betweenthe time the early disclosures are provided to the consumer and the timethe plan is opened, and the consumer as a result decides to not enter intothe plan, a creditor must refund all fees paid by the consumer in connectionwith the application. All fees, including credit report fees, appraisalfees, and insurance premiums, must be refunded whether such fees are paiddirectly to the creditor or to third parties. A consumer is entitled toa refund of fees under these circumstances whether or not terms are guaranteedby the creditor under andSection; 226.5b(d)(2)(i).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. <T3>Variable-rate plans.</T3> The right referred to in this paragraph doesnot apply to changes resulting from fluctuations in the index value ina variable-rate plan. This includes changes in the annual percentage rateand changes in the maximum rate if the maximum is expressed as an amountover the initial interest rate.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. <T3>Changes in disclosed terms.</T3> If a disclosed term, such as the maximumrate, is stated as a range in the early disclosures, and the term ultimatelyapplicable to the plan falls within that range, a change does not occurfor purposes of this section. If, however, no range is used and the termis changed (for example, a rate cap of 6 rather than 5 percentage pointsover the initial rate), the change would permit the consumer to obtaina refund of fees. If a fee imposed by the creditor is stated in the earlydisclosures as an estimate and the fee changes, the consumer could electto not enter into the agreement and would be entitled to a refund of fees.On the other hand, if fees imposed by third parties are disclosed as estimatesand those fees change, the consumer is not entitled to a refund of feespaid in connection with the application. Creditors must, however, use thebest information available in providing disclosures about such fees.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. <T3>Timing of refunds and relation to other provisions.</T3> The refundof fees must be made as soon as reasonably possible after the creditoris notified that the consumer is not entering into the plan because ofthe changed term, or that the consumer wants a refund of fees. The factthat an application fee may be refunded to some applicants under this provisiondoes not render such fees finance charges under the test set forth in comment4(c)(1)-1.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">5b(h) Imposition of Nonrefundable Fees</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. <T3>Collection of fees before consumer receives disclosures.</T3> An applicationfee may be collected before the consumer receives the disclosures and brochure(for example, when an application contained in a magazine is mailed inwith an application fee) provided that it remains refundable until threebusiness days after the consumer receives the andSection; 226.5b disclosures.No other fees except a refundable membership fee may be collected untilafter the consumer receives the disclosures required under andSection; 226.5b.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. <T3>Collection of fees after consumer receives disclosures.</T3> A feemay be collected after the consumer receives the disclosures and brochureand before the expiration of three days, although the fee must be refundedif, within three days of receiving the required information, the consumerdecides not to enter into the agreement. In such a case, the consumer mustbe notified that the fee is refundable for three days. If the disclosuresand brochure are mailed to the consumer, footnote 10d of the regulationprovides that a nonrefundable fee may not be imposed until six businessdays after the mailing.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. <T3>Relation to other provisions.</T3> A fee collected earlier may becomenonrefundable except that, under andSection; 226.5b(g), it must be refundedif the consumer elects not to enter into the plan because of a change interms. (In addition, of course, all fees must be refunded if the consumerlater rescinds under andSection; 226.15.)</ITAG>Section 226.6_Initial Disclosure Statement8.

(See andSection; 226.5a(a)(3) andthe accompanying commentary for discussion of the types of accounts subjectto andSection; 226.5a.)

Thedisclosures need not be in a form the cardholder can retain. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. <T3>Terms at renewal. </T3>Renewal notices must reflect the terms actuallyin effect at the time of renewal. For example, a card issuer that offersa preferential annual percentage rate to employees during their employmentwould send a renewal notice to employees disclosing the lower rate actuallycharged to employees rather than the rate charged to the general public.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. <T3>Variable rate. </T3>If the card issuer cannot determine the rate thatwill be in effect if the cardholder chooses to renew a variable-rate account,the card issuer may disclose any rate applicable to the account withinthe 30-day period prior to the mailing of the renewal notice.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">5. <T3>Periodic fees.</T3> If a renewal fee is billed more often than annually,the renewal notice should be provided each time the fee is billed. In thisinstance, the fee need not be disclosed as an annualized amount. Alternatively,the card issuer may provide the notice no less than once every twelve monthsif the notice explains the amount and frequency of the fee that will bebilled during the time period covered by the disclosure, and also disclosethe fee as an annualized amount. The notice under this alternative alsomust state the consequences of a cardholder's decision to terminate theaccount after the renewal notice period has expired. For example, if a$2 fee is billed monthly but the notice is given annually, the notice mustinform the cardholder that the monthly charge is $2, the annualized feeis $24 and $2 will be billed to the account each month for the coming yearunless the cardholder notifies the card issuer. If the cardholder is obligatedto pay an amount equal to the remaining unpaid monthly charges if the cardholderterminates the account during the coming year but after the first month,the notice must disclose that fact.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">6. <T3>Terminating credit availability.</T3> The regulation does not addressthe form or the content of the card issuer's instructions on how and whena cardholder may terminate credit availability to avoid paying the renewalfee. State and other applicable law governs whether the card issuer may,for example, require the consumer's response to be in writing or the outstandingbalance to be repaid in full.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">9(e)(1) Notice Prior to Renewal</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. <T3>Timing of advance notice.</T3> If the card issuer chooses to give advancenotice under andSection;226.9(e)(1), the renewal notice must be providedat least 30 days or one billing cycle, whichever is less, before the renewaldate. Thus, for example, if a billing cycle is 28 days (February 1 throughFebruary 28) and an annual fee is posted to the account on the first dayof the following billing cycle (March 1), the issuer must give notice sothat the cardholder has at least 28 days both to make a decision aboutthe renewal of the account and to use the card without having the fee billedto the account. If a cardholder sends timely notice (on February 28) ofa decision not to renew the account and the fee is posted before the cardissuer receives the notice (for example, March 3), the card issuer willbe deemed to be in compliance if the fee is reversed or otherwise withdrawnduring the March billing cycle and the cardholder is not required to takeany additional action to have the fee removed from the outstanding balance.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">9(e)(3) Notification on Periodic Statements</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. <T3>Interspersed disclosures.</T3> The form of a periodic statement thatcontains renewal notices must comply with the rules in both andSection;226.5aand andSection;226.7. For example, ``annual percentage rate'' must be printedmore conspicuously than other required disclosures to comply with the periodicstatement requirements of andSection;226.7, even though the requirementsof andSection;226.5a would not otherwise require the words to be highlighted.Similarly, the words ``grace period'' must be used and the name of thebalance calculation method must be identified (if listed in andSection;226.5a(g))to comply with the requirements of andSection;226.5a, even though the useof those terms would not otherwise be required for periodic statementsunder andSection;226.7.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. <T3>Preprinted notices on periodic statements.</T3> A card issuer may preprintthe required information on its periodic statements. A card issuer thatdoes so, however, using the advance notice option under andSection;226.9(e)(1),must make clear on the periodic statement when the preprinted renewal disclosuresare applicable. For example, the card issuer could include a special notice(not preprinted) at the appropriate time that the renewal fee will be billedin the following billing cycle, or could show the renewal date as a regular(preprinted) entry on all periodic statements.andCx.21;</ITAG>14.

The Fair Credit and Charge Card DisclosureAct fully preempts state laws relating to the disclosure of credit informationin consumer credit or charge card applications or soliciations. For example,a state law requiring disclosure of credit terms in direct mail solicitationsfor consumer credit card accounts would be preempted. A state law requiringdisclosures in telephone applications for consumer credit card accountsalso would be preempted, even as it applied to applications initiated bythe consumer rather than the issuer, because the state law relates to thedisclosure of credit information in applications or solicitations withinthe general field of preemption, that is, consumer credit and charge cards.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. <T3>Limitations on field of preemption. </T3>Preemption under the FairCredit and Charge Card Disclosure Act does not extend to state laws applyingto types of credit other than open-end consumer credit and charge cardaccounts.

(Whether, asa result, the state law would be voided in its entirety would have to bedetermined under state law.)

Comments app. G-5 through app. G-7 would be added to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">andCx.22;5. <T3>Models G-10(A) through 10(C). </T3>Models G-10(A) and G-10(B) illustratethe tabular format for providing the disclosures required under andSection;226.5a for applications and solicitations for credit cards other than chargecards. Model G-10(A) illustrates the permissible inclusion in the tabularformat of all of the disclosures. Model G-10(B) contains only the disclosuresrequired to be included in the table, while the three additional disclosuresare shown outside of the table. The two forms also illustrate two differentlevels of detail in disclosing the grace period, and different arrangementsof the disclosures. Model G-10(C) illustrates the tabular format disclosurefor charge card applications and solicitations and reflects all of thedisclosures in the table. Disclosures may be arranged in an order differentfrom that in model forms G-10(A), (B), and (C); may be arranged verticallyor horizontally; need not be highlighted aside from being included in thetable; and are not required to be in any particular type size. Variousfeatures from different model forms may be combined; for example, the shortergrace period disclosure in model form G-10(B) may be used in any disclosure.While proper use of the model forms will be deemed to comply with the regulation,card issuers are permitted to use headings and disclosures other than thosein the forms (with an exception relating to the use of ``grace period'')if they are clear and concise and are substantially similar to the headingsand disclosures contained in model forms. For further discussion of requirementsrelating to form, see the commentary to andSection; 226.5a(a)(2).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">6. <T3>Models G-11 and G-12. </T3>Model G-11 contains clauses that illustratethe general disclosures required under andSection; 226.5a(e) in applicationsand solicitations made available to the general public. Model G-12 is amodel clause for the disclosure required under andSection; 226.5a(f) whena charge card accesses an open-end plan offered by another creditor.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">7. <T3>Models G-13(A) and G-13(B). </T3>These model forms illustrate the disclosuresrequired under andSection; 226.9(f) when the card issuer changes the entityproviding insurance on a credit card account. Model G-13(A) contains theitems set forth in andSection; 226.9(f)(3) as examples of significant termsof coverage that may be affected by the change in insurance provider. Thecard issuer may either list all of these potential changes in coverageand place a check mark by the applicable changes, or list only the actualchanges in coverage. Under either approach, the card issuer must eitherexplain the changes or refer to an accompanying copy of the policy or groupcertificate for details of the new terms of coverage. Model G-13(A) alsoillustrates the permissible combination of the two notices required byandSection; 226.9(f)_the notice required for a planned change in providerand the notice required once a change has occurred. This form may be modifiedfor use in providing only the disclosure required before the change ifthe card issuer chooses to send two separate notices. Thus, for example,the references to the attached policy or certificate would not be requiredin a separate notice prior to a change in the insurance provider sincethe policy or certificate need not be provided at that time. Model G-13(B)illustrates the disclosures required under andSection; 226.9(f)(2) when theinsurance provider is changed.andCx.21;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, November 15, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">William W.
