<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-55-1280 </DOCNO><TEXT>The calibration error is consistent with the error of 1% for the home-madesensor. The total errors of the calibration devices for high temperatureand for dynamic method under irradiation are less than 0.34% respectively.The maximum flux-time is 1.7 x 10/sup 20/ n/cm/sup 2/ during the irradiationtest. Three displacement values are provided by means of the dynamiccalibration method. The calibration result is more reliable than thatprovided by conventional standing method which only gives one displacementvalue. For the calibration in high temperature, the K which is relatedto the reciprocal of sensitivity C of the sensor is adopted as charateristicfactor, which brings convenience to users, The calibration devices withreasonable configuration are reliable, and the irradiation calibrationdevice has advantages of easy handling, good reliability, safety andeconomy.</TEXT></DOC>
