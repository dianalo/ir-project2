U.S. District Judge Marvin Aspen on Thursday also ordered AlfredElliott, 45, a former law partner in Schiff, Hardin andamp; Waite, to paythe government $332,000 in fines and $353,000 in profits he madefrom trading stocks based on inside information he obtained over atwo-year period.   ``You are a brilliant, talented man who could have accomplishedanything you wanted in the practice of law,'' Aspin told Elliottbefore the sentencing. ``But to accumulate money and stockpile itthe way you did, that kind of greed boggles the mind.''   Elliott was one of two lawyers at the firm who representedcompanies on imminent corporate mergers and acquisitions. He wasindicted last July and convicted later on 70 counts of usingconfidential information to buy and sell stock. He reportedly mademore than $600,000 between March 1984 and April 1986.   Elliott said he knew he had made a mistake and that he had triedto right the wrongs made against the law firm, which he left in 1986after his actions became known.   ``I realize what I did was wrong. It was crazy, nuts,'' Elliottsaid. ``I am a person of integrity and I really am sorry thishappened.''   Elliott's attorney, James Streicker, also had argued for leniencyin the sentencing, and compared his client's case to that offinancier Ivan F. Boesky, The Wall Street speculator is serving athree-year prison sentence for conspiracy to lie to the Securitiesand Exchange Commission, a sentence he received after striking aplea bargain with federal prosecutors in return for his cooperation.   Boesky had agreed in 1986 to pay $100 million to settle insidertrading charges filed by the SEC.   For his part, Elliott paid more than $500,000 in damages andrepaid profits after insider-trading allegations in a 1986 civilcase filed in federal court by the SEC.   But Aspen rejected the comparison of Elliott to Boesky, andsentenced Elliott to five years, which the U.S. attorney's officebelieves to be the stiffest sentence ever imposed in such a case.</TEXT></DOC>
