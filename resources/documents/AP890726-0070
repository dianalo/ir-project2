A newspaper said an informaltruce was in effect.   A police spokesman, said two of the vessels dropped anchor atBeirut port in the city's Christian sector and three arrived in theport of Jounieh, in the Christian heartland.   The spokesman refused to give any information about the ships.   He said Syrian gunners, deployed in Moslem west Beirut, fired``only six howitzer shells'' at the Christian-controlled coastlineas the ships steamed slowly into dock.   He said no casualties were reported and noted it was ``veryunusual of the Syrians not to fire heavily'' at ships heading forports in the 310-square-mile Christian enclave.   The daily newspaper An-Nahar said an ``undeclared truce'' hadtaken effect in the 19-week confrontation between Gen. MichelAoun's Christian forces and Moslem militias allied with Syriantroops. The report could not be confirmed.   The Syrian land and sea blockade imposed March 8 has left theChristian community desperately short of fuel, food and othersupplies. It was imposed after Aoun blockaded illegal militia-runports south of Beirut.   A spokesman for Aoun's headquarters who refused to be namedconfirmed that ``several vessels'' anchored at Christian portsovernight and said the Syrians ``fired a only few rounds... I don'tknow why their barrage was not as intense as it usually is.''   Also today, Syrian and Christian forces skirmished withautomatic rifles across Beirut's dividing Green Line, wounding ninepeople.   That raised the overall toll to 453 killed and 1,869 wounded inthe current round of Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war.   An-Nahar said a three-member Arab League committee had won atemporary truce after ``discreet contacts'' with the warring sides.   The paper said the ``combatants agreed to give the committeeanother chance to bring about a peaceful end to the conflict.'' Itdid not elaborate.   An-Nahar noted, however, that in the absence of any officialtruce announcement ``it is not known how long the cease-fire wouldlast.''   King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, King Hassan II of Morocco andAlgerian President Chadli Bendjedid were asked at an Arab Leaguesummit in May to settle the Lebanese conflict by November.   The Kuwaiti daily newspaper Al-Qabas, in a front-page report,said the Arab committee has decided to freeze its mediation due toSyria's refusal to accept Aoun as a negotiating partner.   The paper quoted Syrian President Hafez Assad as telling theSaudi, Moroccan and Algerian foreign ministers during a recentmeeting in Damascus: ``If our Lebanese allies accept Aoun as anegotiator on behalf of the other party, we will not accept him.This is a final and irreversible decision.''   ``Accordingly, the three-member commitee has decided to freezeits activities for a short period of time, pending a solution tothis snag,'' the report added.   Aoun, a Maronite Catholic, declared a ``war of liberation''against Syria's 40,000 troops, who were deployed in predominantlyMoslem sections of Lebanon under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate.   The Christians contend the Syrian troops betrayed their mandateby fighting on the Moslem side in the civil war.</TEXT></DOC>
