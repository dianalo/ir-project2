Directcross sections for higher-lying vibrational states are provided fromDWBA calculations, normalized using B(E{ital l}) values determined from(d,d') and Coulomb excitation data. Initial fission barrier parametersand transition state density enhancements appropriate to the compoundsystems involved were obtained from previous analyses, especially fitsto charged-particle fission probability data. Further modifications tofit {sup 235}U(n,f) data were small, and the final fission parametersare generally consistent with published values. The results from thispreliminary analysis are compared with the ENDF/B-V evaluation as wellas with experimental data. 26 refs., 5 figs., 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
