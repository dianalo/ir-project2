Workforce has been developed to assist with allaspects of personnel development.andM;- o -andM;Brighton-based ABS Computers Ltd has won an order worth #480,000 from OxfordRegional Health Authority for Arix multi-processors running the WIMS2PLUSworks information management system package: ABS, which also sells Unixsystems from IBM, Prime and Pyramid Technology, says that it achieved 42shipments of Unix medium-scale systems worth #3.5m in 1988, and expects tohavedoubled that number during 1989.andM;- o -andM;The Unix pavilion at Singapore Informatics '89, organised by the SingaporeUnix Association - Sinix - included over 100 exhibitors: Sinix has grown fromfour members in 1985 to over 500, demonstrating the rapid growth in the areaand it brought in speakers from Japan's Sigma project, Unix International andATandamp;T Co (to talk about the joys of Unix System V.4), as well as the presidentof the Australian Unix Users Group to give a one-day panoramic view of theoperating system.andM;- o -andM;And New York's recent Unix Expo show was attended by 19,340 Unix enthusiasts- against 16,500 last year, according to the show's owner, NationalExpositions Company Inc - and this despite the power failure on the last dayof the show which kept many visitors outside, and those inside all in thedark.andM;- o -andM;In one of his last acts as mayor of New York City, Ed koch vetoed a bill thatwould have restricted the use of video display terminals by the more than14,000 City employees that work with them: Mayor Koch cited a lack of medicalevidence presented at a hearing on the issue and the cost of implementing thebill, which he estimated at $30m, as reasons for the veto; Koch also said hewas concerned that the bill represented the first step in an effort to extendthe regulations to all those who work in the city, and that such a step&quot;might endanger the business climate&quot;; a similar law was passed in 1987 inLong Island's Suffolk County, and last year protection was extended to allemployees in that county; the bill, which would have mandated breaks, or timeaway from the terminals, for VDU operators at city agencies as well asmeeting part of the cost of eye tests and glasses, and called for lightingand furniture adjustments to prevent alleged eye strain and other disorders&quot;associated with VDU use&quot;, will be reintroduced next year, after Mayor-electDavid Dinkins takes office.andM;- o -andM;Blyth Software Inc, Foster City, California has released the MS-DOS with MSWindows version of its Omnis 5 relational and hierarchical database at $800single-user, $100 for each additional user: Omnis 5 for the Macintosh wasreleased in June, and a version of OS/2 Presentation Manager will be releasedshortly - and applications and data can be shared with the OS/2 PresentationManager and Macintosh versions on a mixed network, Blyth says.andM;- o -andM;Stuttgart-based SEL Alcatel and the Deutsche Bundespost Telekom arm haveagreed on a trial metropolitan area network to start operation towards theend of this year: the idea of the network is to enable business users to movelarge volumes of data more cheaply over shared public transmission networksthan would be possible using point-to-point lines, and the broadband networkwill also support transmission of tomography scans, X-rays, CAD/CAM and otherbusiness images.andM;- o -andM;Norwegian schoolchildren using personal computers are set to become Unixwhizz-kids using Locus Computing Corp's PC-Interface, which integrates MS-DOSmicros with Unix-based local area networks and supports the use of bothMS-DOS and Unix commands on any file residing in the complex: the NorwegianMinistry of Education's Datasecretariat has ordered an initial 200 copiesfrom Locus' Norwegian distributor, Tallgrass Technologies, for use in threehigh schools.andM;- o -andM;NCR Ltd in the UK has now launched its 68030-based Tower 32/300 and 32/500systems: they cost #11,500 and #25,000 respectively, both now.andM;- o -andM;Zentec Corp, San Jose, California, has a new version of its Genisysprocessing terminal, which uses a 16MHz Intel 80386SX chip: the Genisys SXProcessing Terminal can be configured as a stand-alone system, or with alocal area network board as a terminal to a network or multi-user system; onthe SX, Zentec has removed the CPU unit from the monitor housing and packedit into a wedge-shaped base unit, where it comes with from 1Mb to 8Mb memory,two AT slots and an SCSI interface, and costs $1,600 in OEM quantities.andM;- o -andM;Associated Computer Experts BV, Amsterdam, Holland, has produced a reportcomparing benchmark tests carried out on over 100 Unix systems: the thingsells for $500.andM;- o -andM;Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Mosaic Software Inc now has versions of itsLotus 1-2-3-compatible spreadsheet, called Twin/UX, available for Sun-3 andSun-4 systems.andM;- o -andM;SQL communications specialist Gnosis NV, Antwerp, Belgium, has formed aBritish subsidiary, Gnosis UK Ltd, up in Stockport, Cheshire, and headed byRichard Taylor; France is to be Gnosis' next port of call.andM;- o -andM;Intersystems Corp, Cambridge, Massachusetts, has joined Sequent ComputerSystem Inc's associate programme - the two companies are to offerIntersystems' M/SQL databse on Sequent's multiprocesing Symmetry series andprices are $19,900 to $339,000: M/SQL is a merge of SQL query language andMumps database programming environment.andM;- o -andM;Gossip was flying again on Friday that Adia SA has thought again its plan tohang on to the Meridian International leasing business, and talk is of amanagement buyout: developments are expected this week.andM;- o -andM;Something is definitely up between ICL and Fujitsu Ltd and one area of closercollaboration seems likely to be Unix: although Fujitsu fabricates 25MHz and20MHz versions of the Sparc, it doesn't yet have a Sparc-based machine in itsproduct line, which suggests that it may be planning to take the ICL UnicornSparc machines OEM; it has clear ambitions to get into the European systemsbusiness in a big way but at this stage in the game, there is little point intrying to Europeanise its proprietary IBM-like but not IBM-compatiblemid-range computers; a first step to a closer alliance on the continent couldwell be a merger of Fujitsu Espana and ICL Espana - Fujitsu has the strongerpresence on the ground in Spain but ICL has a much wider range of appropriateproducts and software.andM;- o -andM;IBM's shares participated fully in the New Year rally on Wall Street, andbucked the downtrend on Thursday, adding $1.125 to close at $100 even:markets always over-react in both directions, and with a solid yield of 5%,IBM shares were almost certainly oversold at below $100.andM;- o -andM;As part of the big reorganisation that will see McDonnell Douglas InformationSystems become a British company quoted on the London International StockExchange, sales and marketing of the Reality Pick machines to dealers in theUS is to pass from the former headquarters operation to McDonnell DouglasField Service Co, which itself is on the block, but will not pass to the UKcompany; manufacturing will continue in the US for the North American and FarEastern markets.andM;- o -andM;IBM has gone to Lynx Real-Time Systems Inc for its LynxOS real-time Unixalikefor use on the on-board computers for the US Space Station Freedom, due up in1996.andM;- o -andM;British Telecom offers such a service already, but now ATandamp;T Co has filed forpermission to offer US businesses computer access to directory inquirydatabases: the Find America service is due to start on February 18 in theSouthwestern Bell Corp area, but ATandamp;T hopes to sign all the Baby Bells beforethe end of the year: the service will cost a daunting $2,200 a month, plus 35cents per screen and $22 an hour in connection charges; ATandamp;T expects $12.6mbusiness from it in the first year, $83m in the third.andM;- o -andM;Pacific Telesis Group Inc is joining the army of phone companies seeking toreduce their workforces, and is looking to lose 7,600 non-salaried people and3,400 managers from Pacific Bell via early retirement offers and otherincentives.andM;- o -andM;Symbolics Inc, Burlington, Massachusetts expects to report sales for itssecond quarter to December 31 about $3m down on those for recent quarters andas a result will see an operating loss of about $2m: the company blames &quot;theimpact on our customers' capital budgets caused by current economicuncertainty, fewer sales than we anticipated of our new UX400S co-processorboard for Sun Microsystems workstations, and delay in our final release ofenhancements to our graphics and animation products&quot;.andM;- o -andM;Kubota Ltd will pay $10m for Domain Technology Inc's Winchester San Jose diskplatter substrate plant.andM;- o -andM;Litton Industries Inc has engaged First Boston Corp to sell three of itsdivisions in electrical and electronic interconnection products: thedivisions are Advanced Circuitry and its Inter-Pak Electronics operation inSpringfield, Missouri;

a 16Mb Data General Eclipseminicomputer with 1Gb of disk is to be used in conjunction with printers andautomatic mailing machines which will issue accounts for court fees, producethe summonses and reply forms and dispatch them to defendants at a rate of10,000 a day, as well as send record cards and copies of summonses to courts:requests for summonses will be received on half inch magnetic tape fromclients such as credit firms, building societies and the water authorities;at present 28 companies have signed up for the service.andM;- o -andM;AST Research Inc, Irvine, California looks to have overcome its difficultiesand avoided the threat of being swept away by the fierce competitivepressures in the personal computer market: it expects to report a profit of$7m for its fiscal second quarter to December 29 versus a loss of $8.9m, onsales of about $130m, up from $110m; key selling point is that it designs itsmachines so that they can be upgraded by swapping the CPU board.andM;- o -andM;Daisy Systems Corp has reached a standstill agreement with its principalsecured lender, Heller Financial Inc, under which Heller will forbear fromenforcement of its loan to Daisy until February 15.andM;- o -andM;The computer industry delights in boasting that if the motor industry hadprogressed at the same rate over its lifetime, a Rolls Royce would today do amillion miles to the gallon and cost sixpence or whatever, but nothinghighlights the software crisis, and the Achilles heel of the industry morestarkly than the fact that Microsoft Corp has still not shipped an operatingsystem capable of exploiting the features of the 80386 chip, even though the80386 has now been superseded by the 80486: if the motor industry was asincompetent, your five-year-old 150mph Ferrari designed to use unleadedpetrol would still be able to run at a top speed of only 40mph because theappropriate fuel to liberate its performance would still only be promised for&quot;sometime this year&quot;.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
