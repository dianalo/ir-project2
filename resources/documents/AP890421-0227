Separately, the central bank in Belgium raised interest on fivekey lending rates, mirroring Thursday's moves by West Germany'sBundesbank as well as rate increases announced by the central banksof Austria and Denmark.   The Bundesbank's initial actions jolted financial markets in theUnited States, where Wall Street suffered a selloff, bond pricesslipped and the dollar lost substantial ground.   In early trading today, however, the dollar was mixed and bondprices were holding firm. Traders continued to look for indicationsas to whether Britain and Japan would follow with rate increases oftheir own.   Analysts said they expected the Dow Jones industrial average,which lost nearly 10 points on Thursday, to bounce back.   The unsettling of financial markets began when the Bundesbankraised West Germany's discount rate to 4.5 percent from 4.0 percentand the Lombard rate _the effective ceiling on overnight loansbetween banks _ to 6.5 percent from 6.0 percent.   Today the central bank set short-term Treasury note rates at 5.0percent, up from 4.5 percent effective immediately. A Bundesbankspokesman said the rate on the notes, whose maturity is between 3and 4 days, usually is set in accordance with the discount rate.   Domestic overnight rates also rose.   A dealer at a major West German bank said the market is ``allconfused and nervous'' following the unexpected shift in the rates.Although market liquidity remains sufficient, he said there were``too many question marks about the Bundesbank's behavior, whichmade short-term rates unstable.''   Belgium's National Bank said it was raising its discount andLombard rates by a half a percentage point each as well as hikingrates on Treasury bills following ``changes in interest ratesabroad.'' Belgium usually follows changes in interest rates in WestGermany, a key trading partner.   The new discount rate takes effect Monday. The other rates tookeffect today.</TEXT></DOC>
