Meanwhile, per-share earnings rose 19% to 50 cents, from 42 cents in the year-ago period, aided by double-digit sales increases in lodging and restaurant operations. Sales rose 12% to $1.67 billion from $1.5 billion.    As a result of the buy-back effort, the weighted average of shares outstanding shrank to 116.9 million in the latest period from 135.7 million a year earlier.    Much of Marriott's improved performance came from lodging operations, reflecting the addition over the past 12 months of 87 hotel properties with more than 15,000 rooms. Lodging sales rose 15%, and the division's pretax profit climbed 18%, aided by a $4 million pretax gain on the sale of an equity interest in the Hong Kong Marriott hotel.    The company said occupancy rates rose at its Courtyard and Residence Inn chains, while losses for Fairfield Inn, a new economy-segment chain, were &quot;minor&quot; and &quot;in line with expectations.&quot;    Meanwhile, sales and profits rose more modestly for the company's contract services, which include airline catering and health-care institution operations.    Restaurant sales improved 11% and pretax profit increased 13%, reflecting what the company called &quot;solid&quot; gains for its Roy Rogers chain and strong turnpike traffic.    For the first nine months, earnings rose 4% to $167.5 million, or $1.39 a share, from $161.3 million, or $1.19 a share. Sales rose 14% to $5 billion from $4.4 billion.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Marriott closed yesterday at $31.25 a share, up 62.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
