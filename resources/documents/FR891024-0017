It creates an informal and formalinvestigation process through which the NCUA may determine, through theuse of administrative subpoena and other investigative tools, whether anycredit union or institution-affiliated party (as defined under FIRREA and,as necessary, by the NCUA Board) has violated, is violating or is aboutto violate any provision of the Federal Credit Union Act, the Board's regulationsand other statutes or regulations that may bear on any parties fitnessto participate in the affairs of a credit union, whether any party is unfitto participate in the affairs of a credit union, whether formal enforcementproceedings are warranted, or such other matters as deemed appropriate.The current statutory language (12 U.S.C. 1784, 1786, 1787) controls suchauthority in the context of credit union examinations. This rule is necessarybecause the changes in FIRREA have clarified the scope of NCUA investigatoryauthority. Section 747.1002 sets forth rules to protect information obtained pursuantto informal and formal investigations. Section 747.1003(a) broadly defines the scope of NCUA investigations. Thisrule also incorporates the broader term ``institution-affiliated party''used in Section 901 in FIRREA and includes both persons directly associatedwith the credit union through employment or officer status and outsideparties as defined by the statute and as determined by the Board which``caused or is likely to cause more than a minimal financial loss to, ora significant adverse effect on, the insured credit union.'' The statute gives the Board latitude to define who is ``institution-affiliated''prospectively through an encompassing regulation or on a ``case-by-casebasis.'' The NCUA Board is specifically soliciting comments to better definethe term ``institution-affiliated party'' for the purpose of drafting andestablishing published guidelines. As examples, should parties that conductregular, ongoing business with a credit union, such as vendors, data processorsand broker-dealers be deemed to be an ``institution-affiliated party.''Section 747.1003(b) defines a ``formal'' and ``informal'' investigation.Formal investigations make use of the NCUA Board's power to subpoena documentsand take sworn depositions from witnesses. Section 747.1003(c) is a delegation of authority by the NCUA Board to theGeneral Counsel, or his designee, to initiate investigations. Under thisrule, the General Counsel will issue a written order of the purpose ofthe investigation and designate specific staff to conduct the investigation.The General Counsel may also narrow or expand the scope of an ongoing investigationwhen appropriate. Subpart K_Formal Investigative Proceedings Subpart K is also new. It sets forth rules for the conduct of a formalinvestigation and outlines the rights of witnesses before the Administration.Section 747.1101 defines the term, ``officer conducting the investigation.''Section 747.1102 states that all formal investigations are non-public matters.Section 747.1103 sets out rules for the issuance, service and enforcementof Administration subpoenas. Section 747.1103(a) states that the officerconducting the investigation may issue subpoenas for both documents andtestimony.Section 747.1103(b)(1) lists four permissible means of serving a subpoenaon a natural person. This section also permits substitute service by anymethod that assures actual notice to the respondent. Section 747.1103(b)(2)outlines service on other than natural persons.Section 747.1103(c) requires the Administration to pay, upon request, witnessfees based on the attendance fee and mileage paid in the district courtsof the United States. Section 747.1103(d) gives the General Counsel thediscretion to seek subpoena enforcement in the courts of the United States.Section 747.1104 allows the officer conducting the investigation to directthat witness statements be sworn. The rule incorporates criminal sanctionsin title 18 of the United States Code for making false statements.Section 747.1105 outlines the basis on which a witness before the Administrationmay refuse to answer questions. Subsection (a) lists the right againstself-incrimination as granted by the Fifth Amendment to the Constitutionof the United States. Subsection (b)(1) prohibits an officer conductingan investigation from granting or promising criminal immunity. Subsection(b)(2) allows the NCUA Board, with the approval of the Attorney General,to issue an order requiring testimony when previously refused. Subsection(b)(3) states that testimony given under subsection (b)(2) may not be usedagainst the witness in any criminal case except a prosecution for perjury,giving false statement, or failing to comply with the order to testify.Section 747.1106 requires formal investigative depositions to be recordedby an official reporter or other person designated by the officer conductingthe investigation. Witnesses may inspect the official transcript of theirtestimony. Witnesses giving testimony to the Administration are entitledto copies of transcripts at their expense unless the Board prohibits releaseof said transcripts for good cause.Section 747.1107 outlines the rights of witnesses testifying before theAdministration. Subsection (a) allows the witness to inspect a copy ofthe NCUA Board's investigatory order. Subsection (b) permits representationby counsel and sequestration of witnesses during the testimony of otherwitnesses. Subsection (c) permits counsel to accompany the witness intothe proceeding, to advise the witness throughout the testimony, to askclarification questions of the witness and to take personal notes of thetestimony. It also permits the officer conducting the investigation tobring outside counsel or other technical expert into the proceedings inan advisory capacity. Subsection (d) permits the officer conducting theinvestigation to report misconduct by a witness or counsel during the proceedings.The NCUA Board has authority to bar such individuals from attending theproceeding or bar the counsel from practicing before the NCUA Board.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Procedures</ITAG>Regulatory Flexibility ActThe NCUA Board has determined and certifies that this proposed amendment,if adopted, would not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small credit unions (primarily those under $1 million in assets).It would not impose an additional burden upon credit unions. Accordingly,the Board has determined that a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is notrequired.Paperwork Reduction ActThe Board has determined that the requirements of the Paperwork ReductionAct do not apply.Executive Order 12612The NCUA Board, pursuant to Executive Order 12612, has determined thatthis rule will not have a substantial direct effect on the States, on therelationship between the national government and the States, or on thedistribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels ofgovernment. Further the new rule will not preempt provisions of state lawor regulation.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 747 </ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Claims, Credit unions, Equal accessto justice, Lawyers, Penalties.By the National Credit Union Administration Board on October 17, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="6">Becky Baker,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Secretary of the Board.</ITAG>Accordingly, NCUA proposes to amend its regulations in 12 CFR Chapter VIIto read as follows: 1.

Thus, for example,the officer may deem it appropriate that outside counsel to the Board attendand advise him concerning the proceeding including the examination of aparticular witness. In these circumstances, outside counsel would not bean officer as that term is used. In other circumstances, it may be appropriatethat a technical expert (such as an accountant) accompany the witness andhis counsel in order to assist counsel in understanding technical issues.The Board wishes to emphasize that these latter circumstances should berare, are left to the discretion of the officer conducting the investigation,and shall not in any event be allowed to serve as a ruse to coordinatetestimony between witnesses, to oversee or supervise the testimony of anywitness, or otherwise defeat the beneficial effects of the witness sequestrationrule.(d) The officer conducting the investigation may report to the Board anyinstances where any witness or counsel has been guilty of dilatory, obstructionistor contumacious conduct during the course of a formal investigative proceedingor any other instance of violations of these rules. The Board will thereupontake such further action as the circumstance may warrant including barringthe offending person from further participation in the particular formalinvestigative proceeding or even from further practice before the Board.<ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-25038 Filed 10-23-89; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 7535-01-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
