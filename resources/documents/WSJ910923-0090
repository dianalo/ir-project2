Last year, smokersmade up 60.5% of the male population, down less than onepercentage point from 1989. The rate for women, however,jumped 1.6 percentage points -- or by 810,000 women -- to14.3% of the female population. Women in their 20s accountedfor nearly 20% of all female smokers.   Indeed, Japan &quot;is a tobacco smoker's paradise,&quot; lamentsBungaku Watanabe of the Tobacco Information Center, a civicgroup that campaigns against smoking.   Certainly, many foreign tobacco companies seem to bethriving in Japan. Even the managing director of the nation'stobacco-industry group, the Tobacco Institute of Japan,professes admiration for recent marketing efforts by foreigncompetitors. &quot;Unlike the case of automobiles, {foreigntobacco companies} are studying the Japanese market verywell,&quot; says Takahiko Ikeda.   Foreign makers held only 2% of the Japanese cigarettemarket before Japan's liberalization of tobacco imports beganin 1985. But following the 1987 abolition of import duties,the foreign share has been surging -- and may be near itspeak.   Foreign tobacco makers held a combined market share of15.9% in the year ended March 31, after chalking up a 10.9%rise in sales volume to 51.1 billion cigarettes. While that10.9% growth rate was less than the 24% surge recorded forthe previous year, it is sizable when compared with theexpansion of the entire market during the same period.   Cigarette sales in Japan climbed 3.3% to a record 3.6trillion yen ($26.89 billion) in the year ended March 31.Sales volume for the period was also a record, rising 2.6% to322 billion cigarettes. The value and volume of sales alsoincreased in the year ended March 31, 1990; but prior tothat, sales had been leveling off or on a gradual decline.   Philip Morris Cos., Brown andamp; Williamson Tobacco Corp. andR.J. Reynolds Tobacco International Inc. hold 10%, 3.3% and1.9%, respectively, of Japan's cigarette market, according tothe Tobacco Institute of Japan. Together, the three U.S.companies account for 95% of all foreign cigarettes sold inJapan.   While some foreign tobacco-industry officials predicttheir combined market share will reach 20% within severalyears, the pace of growth is expected to slow. &quot;It is ascramble for market share because Japan's tobacco market isbasically a matured one,&quot; says Konosuke Sakane, generalmanager of corporate affairs for R.J. Reynolds's Japanoperations.   High demand for foreign cigarettes that resulted from thelifting of import duties &quot;has run its course,&quot; Mr. Sakanesays. He adds that Japan Tobacco Inc., the government-ownedcompany that makes all of Japan's cigarette brands, isfighting the foreign onslaught.   Masamichi Kumagai, senior analyst at Japan MarketingResearch Institute Inc., says price reductions due to theelimination of tariffs are &quot;one of the biggest factors&quot; inforeign makers' rapid sales growth in Japan. But he says alack of marketing expertise in the past on the part of JapanTobacco also contributed to the initial success of foreignbrands. He adds, however, that the institute has almostcaught up to the foreign makers' marketing expertise.   Still, in the minds of consumers, ads for Japanesecigarettes often seem to take second place to American ads.&quot;All I remember concerning tobacco ads are Philip Morris,Lucky Strike . . . nothing about Japanese tobacco,&quot; says Ms.Watanabe. The American ads generally feature couples orgroups engaged in some kind of activity -- riding amotorcycle, say, or singing. A typical Japanese ad features asolitary man smoking.   In fact, some anti-tobacco activists say the American adsare too successful and blame them for a recent sharp rise inthe number of female smokers. Japan's smoking populationincreased by 890,000 people to 33.19 million last year, withfemale smokers accounting for much of the rise, according toestimates by Japan Tobacco.   In the past, Japanese women, particularly young ones,typically avoided smoking in public. But today, partlybecause of the rising number of women in Japan's work force,it isn't unusual to see female smokers at railway stationsand in coffee shops and office cafeterias.   Japan's smokers are also getting younger. About 22% ofmale high-school seniors smoke more than one pack ofcigarettes a week, according to a recent survey by the OsakaCancer Prevention and Detection Center. Tobacco ProblemsInformation Center, a major anti-tobacco organization,estimates that Japanese under the age of 20 smoked 40 billioncigarettes last year alone, a sixfold increase from 1978.Japanese law forbids those under 20 from smoking; butenforcement is lax, largely because cigarette vendingmachines can be found on nearly every street corner in majorcities.   While there are hints that a nonsmoking movement is afootin Japan, the phenomenon is hardly widespread. One smallconstruction company, for example, offered a total of 10million yen as a reward to be divided among its 70 employeesif everyone quit smoking. While the offer (which has yet toresult in any payoffs) and a few other ones like it made abig splash in the media, such incentives are far frommainstream.   Masakazu Nakamura of the Osaka cancer center says theJapanese medical community isn't very active and that only avery small number of medical organizations have gone on theoffensive against smoking. Calling the situation &quot;shameful,&quot;he says that &quot;awareness {of tobacco issues} even amongmedical-service-related people is very low.&quot;   For the near term, both Japanese and foreign tobaccocompanies are expected to enjoy a free hand in Japan. Anofficial at the country's Health and Welfare Ministrysuggests that it's unlikely that the government will take anystrong steps to curb cigarette consumption. &quot;In the U.S. andEuropean countries, smokers are a minority,&quot; the officialsays. &quot;But in our country, smokers are still the majority, soit is difficult to take a compulsory step across the board.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
