At a news conference Wednesday night, Reagan said the Houserejection of his $36.2 million Contra aid proposal removed thepressure on the Sandinistas and encouraged them to reject acease-fire proposal offered by a mediator during peace talks inGuatemala City.   In addition, he said that while Congress was voting to withdrawsupport from the Contras, the Soviets have doubled military aid tothe Sandinistas this year compared with a comparable period in 1987.   The Nicaraguan Embassy took immediate exception to Reagan'sallegation that the Sadninstas had rebuffed the cease-fireproposal. It maintained the government had ``responded positivelyto the proposal, saying that it was constructive and that it hadseveral points we could work with.''   Reagan ``misstated the truth,'' said Embassy spokeswoman SaraliPorta, accusing the administration of harboring ``a commitment toprevent the achievement of a cease-fire.''   Reagan spoke shortly after Rep. Tony Coelho, D-Calif., disclosedthat a vote on a ``humanitarian'' aid package for the Contras,originally scheduled for today, will be postponed until next week.   He said House members had asked for a delay to allow them moretime to evaluate a Democratic plan and a rival Republican proposal.   The $30.5 million Democratic package included $14.6 million forfood, clothing, medicine and shelter for the rebels and a likeamount for medical aid for children who are victims of Nicaragua'sseven-year civil war.   The plan's author, Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., said it had thetacit approval of Costa Rican President Oscar Arias, author of aCentral America peace initiative. Coelho predicted victory for theproposal by a comfortable margin.   Republicans criticized the Democratic plan as too weak to keepthe rebels alive as a fighting force. They proposed an alternativethat would keep the CIA in business as the delivery agent for theaid, and give Reagan a chance to trigger a guaranteed vote onfurther military help for the rebels sometime after May 1.   The Democratic plan would put responsibility for delivery of theaid in the hands of the Defense Department, which would presumablyenlist private contractors to continue air drops to the rebelssimilar to those now supervised by the CIA. It would bar anydelivery of weapons.   At his news conference, Reagan expressed a strong opposition todirect deliveries by the U.S. military.   ``You would be putting our military into a combat situation andthis is what we've been trying to avoid in Central America all theway,'' he said.   The cease-fire proposal Reagan said the Sandinistas had rejectedcalled for the Contras to accept a truce in exchange for four majorpolitical concessions by the government, including unrestrictedpress freedom and a total, unconditional amnesty.   It was not clear why Reagan had said the Sandinistas hadrejected the proposal. On Monday, the State Department stoppedshort of making that accusation, saying only that a Sandinistadelay in responding to the proposal had prompted the mediator,Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, to suspend the talks.   On Saturday, Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega had said theCardinal's proposal ``was not rejected.''</TEXT></DOC>
