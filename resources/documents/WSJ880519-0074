She would invite strangers into the house. We had to do something.&quot;    But while his 85-year-old mother lived in New York City, the advertising sales manager himself lived in Coral Springs, Fla. The answer to his dilemma: He hired Leonie Nowitz, a &quot;private geriatric care manager&quot; in New York, to handle the problem on the scene.    Such &quot;surrogate children&quot; assume the duties for aging parents that adult children can't handle themselves -- or don't want to. Ms. Nowitz assessed the mother's condition, pursued her Medicaid application through months of red tape and screened nursing homes.    The social worker also persuaded the reluctant mother to move into a home. &quot;I couldn't have done it as well,&quot; Mr. Schwamenfeld says. &quot;I probably would have ended up yelling at her.&quot;    For the surrogates, business is booming. More than 600 firms, commonly one-person or two-person operations, offer such private geriatric care management now, compared with fewer than 100 five years ago, says Sarah N. Cohen, president of the National Association of Private Geriatric Care Managers, New York. The boom results &quot;from the tremendous growth of the older population,&quot; adds Ms. Cohen, who is also a care manager.    Care managers commonly say that about half the adult children who seek their services have elderly parents living far away. The rest live near their parents but aren't familiar with the resources needed to handle the parents' problems, lack the time or don't want the trouble. Occasionally, the firms are retained by other relatives, friends or lawyers of older people.    The service may cost anything from a few hundred dollars for a one-time assessment of a parent's condition to a few thousand dollars a year for arranging and supervising 24-hour home care and providing other miscellaneous services. But many children say that the cost is well worth it, that it sharply improves their parents' lives as well as their own.    Care management &quot;has made it possible for my mother to stay in her own home, and it has relieved us of a lot of anxiety,&quot; says Bertram Coren, himself a retired textbook editor in Fort Lee, N.J. Three years ago, his 89-year-old mother, living alone in New York, started to have minor but frightening strokelike incidents. She hated to bathe because one incident occurred in the tub. Once, when the doorbell rang, she couldn't get off the floor to open the door. Police eventually had to break it down.    Meanwhile, the mother was relying on a series of part-time home aides, whom she usually fired after just a few weeks because she couldn't get along with them. &quot;We realized we were in a desperate situation,&quot; Mr. Coren says. So he retained Bernice Shepard, a New York care manager, who now arranges and supervises round-the-clock care, taking care to make sure that his mother and the home-care aides are compatible.    &quot;We could not have done it ourselves,&quot; Mr. Coren says. &quot;We would not know where to find the people. Before this, we were just on the edge of catastrophe all the time. We never knew when the phone would ring with an emergency.&quot;    The surrogate services usually cost $300 to $400 a month, Mr. Coren says. With the home care itself costing over $30,000 a year, the total cost is about the same as that of a good nursing home, he says.    Most care managers are trained as geriatric social workers or nurses, and the problems they encounter often demand their specialized skills. A client of Rona Bartelstone in North Miami Beach, Fla., might have seemed like a harmless woman in her mid-80s -- until she pulled a knife on her home aide. But Ms. Bartelstone had already trained the home aide to withdraw from the situation if the easily agitated and paranoid woman couldn't be calmed. The aide locked herself in a bedroom until the woman calmed down. Later, Ms. Bartelstone took the woman to a doctor, who prescribed medication to deal with her hallucinations and agitation, which aren't uncommon among the elderly.    Ms. Cohen, the New York care manager and association president, recalls getting a call at 11:30 one night because a 98-year-old woman was afraid to go to bed. &quot;I went over and found she was afraid to get undressed because she knew it would take four hours for her to dress again,&quot; Ms. Cohen says. &quot;She just forgot that her home aide would be there in the morning to help her.&quot; Later, the woman agreed to 24-hour-a-day care.    A New York woman, alarmed that her mother was losing weight, once retained Rita Seiden, a care manager in Brooklyn. The surrogate persuaded the reluctant mother to visit a doctor, who found no medical problem. Ms. Seiden determined that the forgetful mother found shopping and cooking overwhelming tasks and had given up. She then arranged for the daughter to bring her mother prepared platters of food, a week's supply at a time, ready to be taken out of the refrigerator and eaten. The mother soon returned to normal weight.    Such problems of coping are common. Ms. Cohen says the majority of her patients suffer from dementia. Often family members won't recognize the illness and the need for care.    Ms. Shepard cites an aging man who refuses to recognize his wife's dementia stemming from Alzheimer's disease. &quot;If she pounds on the table, he gets mad and she hits him,&quot; Ms. Shepard says. &quot;We're trying to get him to see that his wife needs care -- and that he needs some relief, too. We arranged for him to spend a weekend in Connecticut with friends&quot; while his wife stayed in New York with a caretaker, she says. &quot;Finally, we got him to at least accept part-time care for his wife. We also persuaded him to let his wife go twice a week to a program of stimulation and relaxation for Alzheimer's patients.&quot;    There is a potential for conflicts of interest in the field. For example, a care manager has a vested interest in keeping a parent out of a nursing home, perhaps longer than makes sense.    Other abuses are possible. A Minnesota care manager charged clients $200 just for names of nurses, lawyers and the like that she kept in a shoebox, says Marcie Parker, senior research associate of the InterStudy Center for Aging and Long-Term Care, Excelsior, Minn., which has studied care management. The woman, who has since left the field, also collected fees from the nurses and others she recommended, a practice social workers consider unethical, Ms. Parker adds.    But so far, problems have been rare, Ms. Parker says. Although &quot;there is very little specific regulation&quot; of care managers, she notes, most people in the field are covered by their codes of ethics as nurses or social workers.    ---                     Where They Live   Living arrangements for people 65 and over outside of institutions:                        (In percent)    Living with spouse        Men                               75.3%        Women                             38.3%    Living with other relatives        Men                                7.2%        Women                             18.2%    Living alone        Men                               14.9%        Women                             41.3%    Living with nonrelatives        Men                                2.5%        Women                              2.1%                      For people 75 and over:    Living with spouse        Men                               67.9%        Women                             22.8%    Living with other relatives        Men                               10.2%        Women                             23.8%    Living alone        Men                               19.2%        Women                             51.0%    Living with nonrelatives        Men                                2.7%        Women                              2.4%    Source: Census Bureau</TEXT></DOC>
