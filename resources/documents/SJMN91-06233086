Two of them -- Defense Minister Dmitri Yazov andPrime Minister Valentin Pavlov -- were reportedly replaced because ofillness.;   Pavlov's replacement was reported on state television. Word ofYazov's ouster came from Vladimir Lukin, the same Russian republic officialwho reported Yeltsin's conversation with Yanayev.;   A duty officer at theSoviet Defense Ministry's press center said he could neither confirm nor denythe report on Yazov.;   The report came as demonstrators surrounding theparliament building expressed fears of an assault.;   Yeltsin has rallied tensof thousands of protesters, who flooded the streets, defying tanks and agovernment ban on demonstrations.;   As the tanks formed columns near theparliament building, the Russian president told British Prime Minister JohnMajor by telephone that the tanks were moving and that he &quot;believed he had notvery much time left.&quot;;   Major told reporters in London that Yeltsin expressedconcern about the safety of his thousands of supporters ringing the building.;  A clandestine radio station inside the building, Moscow Echo, said the tanksrolled to within a mile of the building and that an assault was fearedimminent. The tank column was seen by an Associated Press photographer at theCentral Airfield, about 2 1/2 miles from the building.;   Several tanks wereseen traveling from the airfield toward the Russian parliament building alonga major street but turned off before reaching the building, according to aproducer at the nearby NBC News office. Streets around the parliament buildingwere blocked off.;   Many soldiers were going over to Yeltsin's side. Yeltsinwas quoted as saying that the elite Tamanskaya Motor Rifle Division and theKontimirovsky Tank Guard Division expressed willingness to defend theparliament. He was quoted by Lukin, the head of the Russian parliament'sForeign Relations Committee.;   Demonstrators tore up paving stones from aplaza near the parliament building and cracking pieces from its marble wall toreinforce the barricades surrounding it.;   On the steps of the parliament, aRussian Orthodox priest blessed youngsters who said they were prepared todefend the building, and the demonstrators were being shown how to usefirebombs. A dozen ambulances were parked behind the building.;   The tankmovement came hours after Yeltsin gave a fiery speech denouncing thehard-liner coup leaders, who represent conservative military and KGB forcesopposed to Gorbachev's democratic and economic reforms.;   &quot;The junta that hascome to power will not stop at anything to keep that power,&quot; Yeltsin told thecrowd of about 150,000. &quot;They understand that things have reached the pointthat if they lose, they will lose not only their armchairs, but they will beseated on court benches.&quot;;   The developments occurred as internationalpressure on the new Soviet rulers grew. President Bush said he spoke withYeltsin today and assured him of continued support for efforts to reinstateGorbachev.;   &quot;There will not be normal relations with the Soviet Union aslong as the coup is in place,&quot; Bush told reporters.;   The European Communityand Japan followed the U.S. lead in freezing aid to Moscow. In the case ofJapan, it was $640 million worth of assistance.;   Another economic threat tothe new government came from within, as coal miners in Siberia and the Sovietfar north heeded Yeltsin's call and walked off the job. But a general strike,also called for by Yeltsin, was failing to materialize.;   Despite its show ofmilitary force, the new government appeared to be making some efforts toplacate Yeltsin. The Russian republic's vice president said the chairman ofthe Supreme Soviet legislature had agreed to a special meeting of itsPresidium to consider Yeltsin's demands.;   Those demands included theimmediate removal of all restrictions on the media; lifting the state ofemergency in Russia; the return of all troops to their permanent bases;allowing Yeltsin to work at his office in the Kremlin; restoring telephonelines and other communications that have been cut to the Russian governmentheadquarters; and ceasing all threats against the Russian leadership.;   Thecurfew in Moscow, from 11 p.m. to 5 a.m., was announced on the nationalnightly television news program &quot;Vremya&quot; by Col. Gen. N.V. Kalinin, themilitary commandant and commander of the Moscow Military District.;   He alsosaid that police and military patrols will check people's documents and havethe right to detain those without the proper papers. Those found in violationwill be held until the end of the curfew. Failing proper identification, theycan be held for a maximum of three days, he said.;   One speaker told thecrowd outside parliament that a radio broadcast had said Yeltsin's arrest hadbeen ordered. &quot;Will we allow that?&quot; the speaker shouted, to cries of &quot;No!&quot; and&quot;Yeltsin! Yeltsin!&quot; However, the report that Yeltsin was ordered arrestedcould not be confirmed.;   The anti-coup demonstrations spread beyond Moscow.In Leningrad, about 200,000 people jammed Palace Square and cheered for MayorAnatoly Sobchak, a radical reformer like Yeltsin.;   About 400,000 protestersfilled the center of Kishiniev, the capital of the southwestern republic ofMoldavia, according to Moldavian television. Moldavia's leaders issued aresolution calling for the resignation of the coup leaders, the reinstatementof Gorbachev, and for Moldavians serving in the Red Army to &quot;follow thepeople, not the fascists.&quot;;   The Baltics, whose secessionist moves hadinfuriated the hard-liners who toppled Gorbachev, appeared to be absorbing thebrunt of the post-coup crackdown.;   Soviet soldiers today seized control ofLatvian broadcast studios and the central telephone exchange.
