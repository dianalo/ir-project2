The sampling and analytical methods used during the subjectperiod were the same as during the second quarter of 1964 and as describedin previous reports of this series. The report immediately prior to thisone is HW-83423. Data tabulated on pages 4 through 10 are radionuclideconcentrations in coolant from the rear riser effluent samples as determinedby the Purex Analytical Laboratory. The data on page 11 are monthly averagecuries of individual nuclides released per day, calculated by the authorfrom average analytical results and reactor flow rates. Data on page12 are the total curies of the same five radionuclides released duringdiatomaceous earth purges, calculated by Purex Laboratory personnel fromthe water volume during each purge, and the nuclide concentrations foundin purge effluent samples.</TEXT></DOC>
