Patrick Ryan, manager of OTC trading at Johnston, Lemon andamp; Co. in Washington, said the buying came from professional traders and market makers trading for their own accounts and was a response to the 1.2% jump in the industrial average on the New York Stock Exchange, most of which came in the final half-hour of trading.    If institutional investors decide to get in on the action and buy OTC stocks today, Mr. Ryan said, the Nasdaq market could advance without further prompting from the Big Board.    &quot;There seems to be optimism, but it all happened in the last hour,&quot; Mr. Ryan said. &quot;We'll have to see what happens&quot; today, he said.    Lance Zipper, head of OTC trading at Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co., said investor reaction to this morning's government report on second-quarter gross national product growth also will be important. Yesterday's gain was &quot;the first bright spot we've had in a while,&quot; he said. &quot;But it doesn't mean anything until the GNP comes out.&quot;    Volume on Nasdaq remained lackluster as only 124.5 million shares changed hands. Of the 4,401 issues that traded, 1,124 advanced and 829 declined.    The barometers of the biggest OTC issues both were up, as the Nasdaq 100 Index of nonfinancial stocks gained 3.76 to 419.79 while the Nasdaq Financial Index rose 1.46 to 440.90.    Exchange Bancorp jumped 4 1/8 to 21 7/8 after Algemene Bank Nederland said its LaSalle National unit agreed in principle to acquire the Chicago commercial bank holding company for $24 a share, or $420 million.    American depositary receipts of Volvo rose 2 5/8 to 75 3/8. Volvo Concessionaires, a United Kingdom importer and distributor of the Swedish-made automobiles, plans to offer catalytic converters as a no-cost option on all Volvo models beginning next year, the London-based Financial Times reported.    Cerner rose 1 to 13 3/4. Several analysts made positive comments about the developer of clinical information systems, Dow Jones Professional Investor Report said.    While many OTC technology stocks rebounded from sell-offs earlier in the week, Apple Computer lost 1/2 to 38 1/4.    Microsoft, which won a favorable ruling in a copyright suit brought by Apple, gained 3/4 to 52 3/4. Ashton-Tate rose 1/2 to 15. Software Publishing gained 5/8 to 21 1/8.    MCI Communications rose 1 1/8 to 38 1/8. Standard andamp; Poor's upgraded MCI's subordinated debt rating late Tuesday.    Imperial Holly dropped 1 3/4 to 28 1/2, apparently on profit-taking. The company reported first-quarter net income of $4.1 million, compared with a year-earlier loss of $882,000.    TCI International tumbled 1 5/8 to 8 5/8 after reporting that its third-quarter earnings slipped to 10 cents a share from 44 cents a share a year earlier.    Separately, the Securities and Exchange Commission said it suspended trading for 10 days in securities of Lifeline Healthcare Group, beginning yesterday.    The commission said it acted because of questions about recent market activity in the securities and about the adequacy and accuracy of several kinds of information about the company.    In April, the Broken Arrow, Okla., company reported net income for 1988 of $717,564, or 63 cents a share, on revenue of $2.1 million. In May, it paid a 1-for-1 stock dividend to shareholders other than its officers and directors. The move was aimed at thwarting what Lifeline Healthcare said was abusive short selling of its stock. Short sellers bet that a stock's price will fall by borrowing shares and immediately selling them. Their aim is to profit by buying replacement shares later at a lower price.    A spokesman for the company said officials welcome the investigation and hope regulators can &quot;get to the bottom&quot; of the irregularities in the trading of the company's stock. </TEXT></DOC>
