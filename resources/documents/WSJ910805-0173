The junk sale is significant because it is the first timein almost two years that publicly sold high-yield junk bondswill be used to replace what were intended to be temporary&quot;bridge&quot; loans.</LP><TEXT>   In the 1980s, big investment banks made bridge loans tocorporate clients to help them finance takeover deals. Theloans were supposed to be temporary, with the bridge loans tobe paid off quickly from the proceeds of junk bond sales.   But when the junk bond market collapsed in late 1989, WallStreet was stuck with billions of dollars of bridge loansthat couldn't be refinanced in the junk market.   First Boston Corp., which made a number of bridge loans inthe 80s, provided the bridge financing for American MedicalInternational Inc., an operating unit of American MedicalHoldings, when an investor group acquired 86% of the companytwo years ago.   The original bridge was replaced earlier this year with10-year notes, which were transferred to a First Bostonaffiliate. Proceeds from American Medical's planned junk-bondand stock sales will be used to retire about $450 million ofthe notes.   The American Medical bridge was part of nearly $1 billionof bridge loans First Boston had to transfer late last year.The bridges are now held in a special limited partnership inwhich CS Holding, the Swiss majority shareholder in CS FirstBoston Inc., owns an undisclosed stake. CS First Boston isthe parent of First Boston Corp.   Now, with the junk bond market dramatically improved, someon Wall Street expect First Boston and others to unwind theirold bridges for corporate clients.   &quot;This is an opportunity for companies that have performedfairly well to refinance bridges and restructure balancesheets,&quot; says Paul Shaum, head of high-yield research atBear, Stearns andamp; Co.   Among the most talked about candidates is SweetheartHoldings Corp., a paper-cut company whose banker, MorganStanley andamp; Co., sought to refinance a $225 million bridge loanin the junk market last year, but was stymied largely becauseof market conditions.   A more distant possibility is Grand Union Co. The retailfood chain, while steeped in debt, is still considered astrong franchise.   Officials at Salomon, Grand Union's investment banker, andMorgan declined to comment on their plans.   Some say the American Medical offering may be a model forthe bridge refinancings of the future. Unlike in the 80s,when bridges were refinanced almost solely with debt,American Medical is relying on a mix of debt and equity torefinance its LBO-related debt.   The Dallas hospital management holding company plans tosell 16.2 million shares of common stock in the publicmarket. In addition, a partnership led by Harry Gray, formerchairman of United Technologies Corp., and lawyer Mel Klein,together with the First Boston affiliate, have agreed to buy$92 million of stock in a private placement. Both are alreadymajor stockholders in the company. After the offerings, theGray-Klein partnership will own about 34.6% of AmericanMedical, while First Boston will hold 14%, up from 12% beforethe sales.   Analysts say the equity sales are clearly a key to thesuccess of the junk bond offering.   In composite trading on the American Stock ExchangeFriday, American Medical's shares closed at $9.875 a share,unchanged.   American Medical's planned issue of 10-year bonds carriesa rating of single-B-2 from Moody's Investors Service Inc.and a single-B-minus ranking from Standard andamp; Poor's Corp.   The 10-year senior subordinated notes are targeted toyield about 13.5%, well above the 10.5% investors received tohold RJR Nabisco Capital Corp.'s senior notes.</TEXT></DOC>
