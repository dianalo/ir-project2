As former chairman of the National Investor Relations Institute, and as a managing director of a firm that probably arranges more analyst meetings for its clients than any other, I can assure you that, in a proper investor-relations environment, such is not the case.    The information given to analysts in meetings is automatically considered public and must be disseminated to everyone at once if material non-public information is disclosed. Surely the Journal is accustomed to receiving news releases containing words like: &quot;the company reported at an analyst meeting this morning. . . .&quot;    Part of the &quot;drill&quot; for any professionally run analyst meeting is to have an investor-relations or public-relations person prepared to issue a news release on anything inadvertently disclosed by the company during the meeting that is not already public. Anyone who does not follow this practice is not only unprofessional, but is breaking the law.    Because analysts who follow a company are very knowledgeable about it, their questions are incisive and can get close to how well the company is being run and what its real prospects are. The same information is available to any investor or prospective investor (or reporter) who calls the company's investor-relations department.    Perhaps the real point is that you resent that reporters are not invited to many analyst meetings. It would not surprise us if analysts resent not being invited to press conferences. The reasons for this separation are very simple: First, many analysts have told us that they do not want reporters at meetings they attend because they are reluctant to be quoted; second, analysts and reporters will often focus on entirely different aspects of a company: Reporters are interested in what is news, while analysts are interested in data that will help them make intelligent investment recommendations. These are often not the same, and analysts tell us that listening to reporters pursue stories &quot;wastes&quot; some of the limited amount of time analysts are given with senior corporate officers.    I will not maintain that all investor-relations counselors are as professional as they should be, nor that information has never been released at an analyst meeting and not made immediately available to everyone else. But I will say that had such companies handled the matter properly, disclosure would have been made to the Dow Jones News Service and others immediately.    Johnnie D.
