On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the August contract for WestTexas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, broke throughthe $20 level, settling 54 cents higher at $20.25 a barrel. Thecontract had traded as low as $19.78 during the session.   September crude rose 47 cents to close at $19.42 a barrel, whilecontracts for later delivery posted more modest gains.   Among refined products, the July contract for unleaded gasolineadvanced 0.77 cent to finish at 63.69 cents a gallon and heating oilrose 0.16 cent to 49.65 cents a gallon. Other contract months alsofinished higher.   With little economic news to drive prices, analysts attributedMonday's advances mainly to technical factors and to OPEC-relatednews.   Two separate publications reported that Kuwaiti oil output, whilestill above the quota set by the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries, is declining. Kuwait at a meeting earlier this month hadrejected its OPEC-imposed production ceiling and set its own quota,saying it needed to exploit its massive oil reserves.   ``The reports came through, the market reacted briefly but theimpact wasn't lasting,'' said Michael Hiley, energy analyst withDrexel Burham Lambert Inc.   Kuwait's oil minister Sheik Ali Khalifa Al-Sabah also was quotedas denying that Kuwait increased its oil sales after the OPECmeeting in Vienna, Austria, earlier this month. The minister saidthat the emirate's sales blitz, which started before the conference,was halted within days of the meeting's conclusion.</TEXT></DOC>
