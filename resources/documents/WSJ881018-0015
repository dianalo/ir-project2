But trading volume throughout the credit markets was very light.    Treasury bonds traded in a narrow range all day, winding up with gains of about 3/8 of a point, or $3.75 for each $1,000 face amount. Corporate and mortgage-backed bonds finished flat to slightly higher, while state and local government issues were little changed from Friday's closing levels.    The mild rally drove down the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds to 8.87% from 8.90% late Friday. But most short-term interest rates, such as those on Treasury bills and bank certificates of deposit, increased.    Several traders said Treasury bond prices were bolstered by growing speculation that the government won't be able to issue new 30-year bonds next month as part of its quarterly financing operation. Dealers say that would create a temporary shortage, making existing bonds more attractive.    The Treasury already has used up nearly all of its authority to issue long-term debt and has asked Congress to increase its limit. The issue is part of a complex tax bill now ensnarled in a House-Senate conference committee debate. Many bond traders assume Congress won't complete work on the measure before adjourning this week. The Treasury is scheduled to announce details of its quarterly financing on Nov. 2.    &quot;A lot of people think there won't be any new long bonds&quot; next month because of innumerable congressional delays, said William M. Brachfeld, executive vice president of Daiwa Securities America Inc. &quot;That's helping to give the Treasury bond market a firmer tone.&quot;    Alfred G. Roth, senior vice president at Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc., agreed. Speculation that there won't be any new 30-year Treasury bonds next month, thus creating a temporary scarcity, &quot;was the dominant feature&quot; helping to bolster Treasury bond prices yesterday, he said.    Bonds also were helped by government reports released early yesterday indicating somewhat slower economic growth, thus easing inflation fears. One report showed that U.S. business inventories rose 0.8% in August. And the Federal Reserve Board reported that the nation's factories, utilities and mines operated at a seasonally adjusted 83.6% of capacity last month, down 0.2% from 83.8% in both August and July.    But many investment managers and financial executives still fear higher inflation lies ahead.    &quot;I think you will see a creeping-up of inflation next year,&quot; said Anthony M. Solomon, chairman of S.G. Warburg (U.S.A.) Inc. and former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. He said the economy appears to be slowing but that faster growth is likely late this year and in 1989.    &quot;For some time now, I've thought that there would be a slight weakening of the economy late this year or early next year, and I believe we are seeing some of that now,&quot; Mr. Solomon said. But he expects the economy to perk up again next year, expanding at a &quot;substantial rate.&quot;    Treasury Securities   Treasury bond prices finished near their highest levels of the day.    The government's benchmark 30-year bonds were quoted late in the afternoon at 102 21/32, up 11/32 from Friday. The yield fell to 8.87% from 8.90%.    The latest 10-year Treasury notes rose to 103, up 4/32 from Friday, while the yield dipped to 8.78% from 8.80%. The government's new seven-year notes rose to 99 24/32 from 99 21/32, while the yield declined to 8.67% from 8.69%.    An index of long-term Treasury bonds, compiled by Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., rose 2.76 points, nearly the same as Friday's advance of 2.53 points, to close at 1259.30. The high yesterday was 1260.28, and the low was 1254.34.    Traders have been focusing intently lately on congressional developments for clues to whether the Treasury will be able to sell any long-term bonds next month. The Treasury's quarterly financing usually consists of three-year notes, 10-year notes and 30-year bonds.    The tax bill, to which the long-term bond issuance provision is attached, is in a House-Senate conference committee. Even though the long-term bond issuance provision has little opposition, some of the tax bill provisions are controversial, leaving the entire package up in the air.    Uncertainty over the issue should be dispelled soon because Congress is widely expected to adjourn by the end of this week. Even Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd (D., W.Va.) has promised to break out his special &quot;adjournment necktie&quot; shortly.    Most short-term interest rates rose yesterday. For example, the interest rate on federal funds, or reserves that banks lend each other overnight, averaged about 8 3/8%. That was up from 8.14% Friday.    The increase came even though the Fed injected reserves into the banking system by arranging $2.5 billion of repurchase agreements on behalf of a &quot;customer.&quot; The Fed doesn't identify its customers, which include foreign central banks and international financial institutions. Federal funds were trading at 8 5/16% when the Fed entered the market.    The Treasury sold new short-term bills yesterday at higher rates than at last week's auction. The average rate on new 13-week bills rose to 7.36% from 7.32% at the previous week's auction, while the average on new 26-week bills increased to 7.55% from 7.46%.    Treasury bill auctions usually are held each Monday, but last week's sale was held Tuesday because of the Columbus Day holiday.    Here are details of yesterday's Treasury bill auction:   Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.                               13-Week           26-Week   Applications ........ $29,165,475,000   $24,086,835,000   Accepted bids ........ $7,076,515,000    $7,006,025,000   Accepted at low price             44%               79%   Accepted noncompet'ly    $925,765,000      $923,355,000   Average price (Rate)    98.140(7.36%)     96.183(7.55%)   High price (Rate) ..... 98.147(7.33%)     96.208(7.50%)   Low price (Rate) ...... 98.140(7.36%)     96.178(7.56%)   Coupon equivalent .....         7.60%             7.96%   Both issues are dated Oct. 20. The 13-week bills mature Jan. 19, 1989, and the 26-week bills mature April 20, 1989.   Municipal Issues   Municipal bonds ended little changed in a session dominated by a huge new issue by Utah's Intermountain Power Agency.   Intermountain Power is offering about $499 million of power supply revenue refunding bonds. Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. heads the underwriting group.   Speculation that the issuer was planning a major refunding has been circulating for at least a week, muting the impact of the actual launching of the issue, traders said.   Underwriters connected with the sale reported strong early orders for the bonds, including the current coupon serial bonds, term bonds and zero-coupon bonds due 2001-2005.   The Intermountain Power Agency offering was the largest tax-exempt refunding operation undertaken since the Securities and Exchange Commission last month issued for public comment a proposed rule intended to enhance municipal bond market disclosure.   Some issuers and underwriters have said they believe that adoption of the rule could hinder the ability of municipal bond issuers to move quickly in refunding outstanding high coupon debt.   The proposed rule would require underwriting participants to obtain and review copies of nearly final official statements before bidding for or purchasing an offering and to make available copies of preliminary and final statements to investors on request.   &quot;It does make us jump through a few hoops that we didn't necessarily have to before,&quot; said Jim Hewlett, IPA financial officer. &quot;It advances the time we have to have information out on the Street in substantially final form,&quot; narrowing &quot;the window we have to work on disclosure.&quot;   Complying with the proposed regulation, although it's not technically in effect, cost the issuer about $30,000 to $60,000 more than usual for the production of a preliminary official statement, and could cost another $30,000 to $60,000 extra for the official statement in its final form, Mr. Hewlett said.   &quot;Even though the law is not in effect yet, we're going to comply with as much as we can,&quot; he added, noting that &quot;everything that will be disclosed is already in the preliminary&quot; official statement, excluding, for example, pricing details.   The additional costs reflect higher printing costs and fees for attorneys needed to work on the hastily compiled documents, he noted.   The rule &quot;puts you captively in the hands of your printer,&quot; said Mr. Hewlett. Having to print over a weekend &quot;drives the cost up,&quot; he noted.   Corporate Issues   Corporate bond prices finished the session little changed to up 1/8 point in light trading.   No new issues came to market yesterday. But there was a new issue added to the calendar for pricing later in the week, possibly today.   Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co. plans to sell $150 million of eight-year noncallable debentures through underwriters led by Kidder Peabody andamp; Co.   The issue is slated to carry a sinking fund that begins in 1994 to retire 25% of the issue annually. The company will have the option of increasing that to 50% in any year of sinking fund eligibility.   The debentures will have a minimum average life of 6 1/2 years and a maximum average life of 7 1/4 years. The debentures are rated Baa-3 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and triple-B-minus by Standard andamp; Poor's Corp.   Mortgage-Backed Securities   Mortgage securities were unchanged to 6/32 higher in light dealings.   Ginnie Mae's 9% issue for November delivery was quoted at 95 1/2, up 1/8; the 9 1/2% issue at 98 10/32, up 1/8; and the 10% issue at 100 30/32, up 6/32. Freddie Mac's 10% issue was quoted at 100 6/32, up 2/32.   The focus of activity shifted to trades for November settlement from dealings for October settlement, because the five-day October settlement process got under way yesterday. Dealers noted considerably more liquidity in trades for November settlement than for October settlement.   Ginnie Mae's 10% issue was yielding 9.98% to a 12-year average life assumption, as the spread above the 10-year Treasury note widened one basis point to 121 basis points.   Activity in derivative markets was light after a flurry of new Remic offerings late last week. On Thursday and Friday, four Remic issues totaling more than $1.3 billion were priced. The two largest deals were a $410 million Remic from Freddie Mac and a $500 million Remic from Ryland Acceptance Corp.   Underwriters said the Remics, or real estate mortgage investment conduits, sold well.   Foreign Bonds   Prices were mixed in major government bond markets.   In London, British government bonds rallied as much as 5/8 point amid economic data suggesting a slower pace of growth and reduced inflationary pressure.   The figures showed that retail sales volume fell a seasonally adjusted 1% in September from August, although rising 5.1% from the September 1987 level. Sean Bagley, a director of Kleinwort Benson Gilts Ltd., said that while the new data had triggered the rally, it wasn't a significant boost to the market.   He cited technical factors, including recent purchases of bonds by the Bank of England that have created a relative shortage of issues and buoyed prices. The benchmark British treasury 11 3/4% issue due 2003/2007 ended up 20/32 at 117 19/32 to yield 9.47%.   In Frankfurt, traders said profit-taking caused prices of West German government issues to ease about 0.15 point. The government's benchmark 6 3/4s of 1998 traded late in the day at 102.50, off 0.15 point from Friday's close. The yield rose to 6.395%.   Japanese government bonds edged lower in listless trading.   The market had little reaction to the Bank of Japan's morning-session purchase of 200 billion yen in discount bills. Traders say it should have helped the market since the central bank lowered the two-month bill rate 1/16 percentage point, and eased credit temporarily. But the bond market failed to rally on the news.   The benchmark No. 105, 5% bonds due 1997 fell 0.03 point lower at 101.59 to yield 4.75%, up from 4.70%.</TEXT></DOC>
