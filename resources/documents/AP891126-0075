The Communist Party's Central Committee, attempting to regaincontrol of a growing popular revolt on the eve of a planned generalstrike, held a second emergency session in three days and againreshuffled the party's ruling Politburo, dumping three morehardliners.   They were Miroslav Stepan, who resigned as Prague party bossSaturday, Miroslav Zavadil, who also resigned as trade union bossSunday, and Josef Lenart, the longest-serving Politburo member.   The ouster of Stepan and Zavadil from the Politburo had beenloudly demanded by demonstrators in the past week. Stepan wasblamed for police brutality in Prague Nov. 17 that sparked thecurrent protests and Zavadil was highly unpopular as head of theofficial trade unions.   Seven new members, including Vasil Mohorita, chief of theofficial youth movement, and Miroslav Valek, head of the Writers'Union were elected to expand the Politburo to its original size of13 members. The reshuffle on Friday, which dropped seven otherhard-liners including party leader Milos Jakes, had reduced it tonine members.   Only three original Politburo members remain, including newparty chief Karel Urbanek.   Addressing the Central Committee meeting, Urbanek proposed anextraordinary party congress for Jan. 26 which would have the powerto elect an entirely new Central Committee.   The second Politburo reshuffle, the talks with reformists and aCivic Forum meeting with the official Communist youth movement werepart of a frenzied attempt by Communist authorities to avert ageneral strike planned Monday.   Even the armed forces and riot police, who just nine days agobeat peaceful protesters, indicated backing for the movement duringthe rally Sunday. ``We support the democratic changes,'' a riotpoliceman told the crowd, which braved freezing weather and snow.   Premier Ladislav Adamec became the first top official in 20years to share a platform with Dubcek, the former Communist Partyleader who spent two decades in political exile after Warsaw Pacttanks crushed his ``Prague Spring'' reform movement in 1968.   Adamec also held his first talks with leading dissident VaclavHavel and independents in an effort to find a way to end thepolitical crisis and propel Czechoslovakia toward democracy.   ``Dialogue has begun!'' Havel declared triumphantly at therally, which capped a week of pro-democracy demonstrations andhectic moves by the Communists to regain control.   Demonstrations were also reported in Bratislava, Brno, Plsen,Hradec Kralove, Ceske Budejovice, Kosice and other cities.   ``Civic Forum is ready to create a bridge for a peaceful pathfrom totalitarianism to civil freedom, which will later beguaranteed by free elections,'' Havel said, referring to the newpro-democracy group Civic Forum.   Adamec told the cheering crowd there was ``no place for rivalryand interests of prestige.''   State-run television reported 800,000 people at the rally, butreporters estimated no more than about 300,000.   Also Sunday, state television reported that the leaders of thePeople's Party, a small party allied with the Communists, submittedtheir resignations, apparently because of the anti-governmentprotest. A meeting was scheduled Monday to choose replacements.   Dubcek urged the Soviet Union, East Germany and Bulgaria to joinPoland and Hungary in condemning the 1968 invasion that smashed hisattempt to create ``socialism with a human face.''   Those countries have in various degrees accepted the reformsintroduced by Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Hard-line leaderswho rejected change _ Erich Honecker in East Germany, Todor Zhivkovin Bulgaria, and most recently Czechoslovakia's Jakes _ have beenousted.   The Soviet Union signaled support for the developments inCzechoslovakia Sunday with an article by Gorbachev in the CommunistParty daily Pravda that praised Dubcek's catchphrase ``socialismwith a human face.''   In other East bloc developments Sunday:   _Hungarians voted freely for the first time in more than 40years in a national referendum that will decide when their newpresident will be elected and whether politics should be kept outof the workplace.   _Reform-minded East German Communists demanded an investigationinto alleged diversion of hard-currency revenues from about 100party-owned businesses, and a high-ranking Communist said the partyhas lost 200,000 members since September;   _West Germany's Bonn's Die Welt newspaper said Soviet militaryleaders told East German troops not to use force againstpro-democracy demonstrators in their country.   ``Dubcek to the castle!'' the crowd in Prague yelled, referringto the president's residence.   At the one-hour talks between Adamec, Havel and severalindependents who mediated, the opposition demanded free press,release of more political prisoners and a parliamentaryinvestigation into the Nov. 17 incident in which police clubbedhundreds of demonstrators.   The sides agreed to meet again Tuesday, government spokesmanMiroslav Pavel said after the talks, which would have been out ofthe question a week ago.   At the start of the talks, Adamec and Havel shook hands across atable decorated with a small red, white and blue Czechoslovak flag.   The historic handshake was shown on national television, whichhas played a key role in the mushrooming protests, with livefootage of opposition rallies and stormy party meetings as well asits first interview with Havel.   The alacrity with which the authorities responded to oppositiondemands indicated they feared the strike planned for Monday mightattract workers to the pro-democracy movement. There were mountingsigns of worker support last week in the banners carried at rallies.   Adamec was booed at the rally for suggesting the strike last twominutes rather than two hours.   Pavel quoted Adamec as calling the general strike ``a reality wecan hardly change now,'' but appealing to all sides to avoidconfrontation.</TEXT></DOC>
