Pro-Iranian extremists pledged toprotect Western hostages held in the slums, a newspaper reported.   The nation's leading Shiite Moslem cleric said he would work toend the hostage situation.   Police said six people were killed and 14 wounded in the 17thday of fighting between the pro-Iranian Hezbollah and theSyrian-backed Amal militias.   The casualties brought the overall toll to 266 killed and 873injured since fighting broke out May 6 for control of the slums,where extremists linked to Hezbollah are believed holding 18Western hostages, including nine Americans.   Syrian troops appeared poised to enter the area.   ``There is no way to stop the fighting other than a Syrianmilitary deployment,'' Brig. Gen. Ghazi Kenaan, Syria's militaryintelligence chief in Lebanon, said in a statement broadcast byBeirut radio stations.   He did not set a deadline for deployment in the warren of narrowalleys and cement-block shanties that serves as a base forpro-Iranian kidnappers, aircraft hijackers and assassins.   But Kenaan said: ``By the time we deploy, I hope there will beno hostages left in captivity.'' He did not elaborate.   On Saturday, U.S. envoy Vernon Walters said Syria was aware itcould endanger the hostages by moving into the slums.   Walters, the U.S. ambassador at the United Nations, met withSyrian President Hafez Assad in Damascus, Syria.   ``I'm sure that the president is very much aware of the possibledangers and the possible advantages of such an action,'' Walterssaid.   The Al-Ittihad newspaper of Abu Dhabi reported Sunday thatHezbollah has pledged to safeguard all hostages held in the slumsas part of a negotiated, 8-point agreement to regulate the Syriandeployment.   The daily quoted unnamed sources in Beirut as saying the pledgewas made after Syria warned that ``any harm befalling the hostageswill be regarded as an aggressive act against Syria.''   Hezbollah's spiritual guide, Sheikh Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah,said ``I feel with the families of the hostages, and I am doing allI can to reach a happy ending.''   Fadlallah promised to ``invest all my energies'' to resolve thehostage problem and said: ``I am still exerting pressure to reach ahumanitarian solution.'' He did not say who he was pressuring.   Fadlallah released his statement late Saturday through RayBarnett, a Canadian clergyman who represents the U.S.-based Friendsin the West, a Christian Human Rights Group that has been workingfor release of the hostages.   Barnett, hoped to deliver to Fadlallah a petition signed by40,000 people from various countries pleading for the Moslemcleric's help to secure safe release of the hostages.   The hostage held longest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,1985.   Fadlallah, who lives in south Beirut, his two-story residenceriddled with shell pocks and bullet scars, has dropped hisopposition to the entry of Syrian forces into the slums.   ``The doors of the suburbs are open for the Syrian army,'' hesaid in an interview published Sunday by the conservative BeirutAl-Anwar newspaper. ``No party in the suburbs intends to confrontthe Syrians.''   The Syrians massed troops, tanks and armored vehicles around theslums after Hezbollah overran Amal positions to seize control of 90percent of the urban battle ground.   In previous statements, Fadlallah said there was no need for aSyrian military intervention, warning that ``the whole suburbs willbe destroyed if the Syrians move in.''   Shiite sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, attributedhis change of stance to Iranian pressure.   They said Iranian mediators have told Hezbollah leaders thatIran views its alliance with Syria in its war against Iraq as moreimportant than Hezbollah's interests in Lebanon.   Syria considers Lebanon to be within its sphere of influence. Ithas been angered by Iran's attempt to use Hezbollah to control the1.2 million Shiites who make up the largest sect among Lebanon's 4million people.   Iran's deputy foreign ministers Hossein Sheikholeslam and AliMohammed Besharati have been shuttling between Damascus and Beirutfor two weeks to help end the fighting and avert a Hezbollahcollision with the Syrian army.</TEXT></DOC>
