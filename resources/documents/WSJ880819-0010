Traders had spent much of the session fending off earlier rounds of coordinated intervention by the Fed and European central banks.    Dealers said the Fed's final intervention efforts came when the dollar retreated on profit-taking to around 1.9025 marks from a late intraday high of 1.9090 marks. They said the Fed sold another small parcel of dollars after the U.S. currency had bottomed out at 1.8965 marks.    In late afternoon New York trading yesterday, the dollar was at 1.8990 marks, off from 1.9100 marks late Wednesday and at 133.35 yen, down from 133.99 yen. In Tokyo on Friday, the U.S. currency opened at 133.23 yen. The pound traded at $1.6995 yesterday, up from $1.6915 Wednesday.    Earlier, the dollar held its ground as the Fed, the West German Bundesbank and several other European central banks sold dollars in tandem.    Traders said an initial round of coordinated intervention yesterday appeared effective only because it came on the heels of a bearish remark by U.S. Commerce Secretary C. William Verity that had knocked a full pfennig off the dollar.    Mr. Verity was quoted in a West German magazine as saying a dollar at 1.8000 marks would be beneficial for U.S. exports and would help the world economy.    In response to the report, the U.S. unit slipped to about 1.8950 marks, just as the Bundesbank and the Swiss National Bank were sighted selling dollars for their respective currencies.    The West German and Swiss central banks were subsequently joined by the central banks of France, England, Austria and Belgium, dealers reported. The Bank of England sold dollars for sterling, while the others sold dollars for marks.    The concerted intervention succeeded in knocking the dollar down to about 1.8870 marks, but strong demand lifted it off its lows almost immediately.    Dealers said the Bundesbank and the Swiss central bank were joined by their counterparts in the U.S. and Italy for a second round of coordinated intervention at mid-morning New York time when the dollar was changing hands around 1.8970 marks, but the U.S. currency again beat back the challenge and held steady.    Later, the dollar jumped to 1.9080 marks when the Reagan administration said Mr. Verity wasn't its official spokesman on the dollar. Mr. Verity then said his comments weren't intended to &quot;suggest any particular value&quot; for the mark against the dollar.    Dealers said the White House statement reflected an administration whose exchange-rate policy has been thrust into limbo with the departure of Treasury Secretary James Baker, who left to head the presidential campaign of Vice President George Bush.    Dealers say that as long as U.S. policy is in disarray, the market will feel confident about bidding up the dollar.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $432.30 an ounce, up $1.30. Estimated volume was a light two million ounces.    In Hong Kong early Friday, gold was quoted at a price of $432 an ounce.    ---                 Late New York Trading               Thursday, August 18, 1988   Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates.
