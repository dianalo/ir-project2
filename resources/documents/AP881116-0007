Talks between the networks and the 68,000-member AmericanFederation of Television and Radio Artists were extended on aday-to-day basis before the three-year contract expired at midnightTuesday, union spokeswoman Pamm Fair said.   ``Right now, they're really bargaining everything,'' Ms. Fairsaid, adding that a strike was still a possibility.   The contract affects all of the network news broadcasts, sportsprograms, soap operas, game shows and the variety shows ``Late Nightwith David Letterman'' and ``The Tonight Show Starring JohnnyCarson.''   Those covered by the AFTRA contract include the anchormen TomBrokaw, Peter Jennings, Dan Rather and more than 3,000 other networkemployees.   Prime-time videotaped series like ``The Cosby Show,'' are notaffected. Actors on those shows, as well as those on filmed programssuch as ``Moonlighting,'' are covered by a separate agreement withAFTRA and the Screen Actors Guild. That contract expires in July.   Details of the talks, which begin Oct. 4, were not disclosed.   Key issues include working conditions, the economic health of thenetworks and job duties for news reporters. The talks, covering somethree dozen separate contracts, are being held at CBS headquartersin New York.   AFTRA members, who struck for several months in 1980, haveauthorized a strike if the union's 150 directors are unhappy withany proposed contract.   Film and TV production was hobbled recently by a five-monthstrike by scriptwriters and a three-week walkout by drivers,laborers and electricians.</TEXT></DOC>
