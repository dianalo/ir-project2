The most profound consequences fall within West Germany, the new homeland for about 100,000 emigrants expected to arrive this year from East Germany, as well as for some 350,000 ethnic Germans expected to stream in from elsewhere in the Communist bloc. But because West Germany is Europe's largest economy and a major creditor for its allies, the economic ripple effects will likely travel far.    The dam-burst of emigrants has upset myriad assumptions about the West German economy. As a result, economists are in the process of revising forecasts to take into account the influx. The changed outlook entails higher economic growth than was previously assumed, which is regarded as positive for both West Germany and its trading partners. But the future may be clouded by the prospect of higher inflation, and lower German investment in other nations.    &quot;We've increased our forecasts somewhat,&quot; says Norbert Walter, economist with Deutsche Bank AG in Frankfurt. The waves of young, well-trained East Germans, essentially arriving without worldly possessions but expected to get jobs quickly, harbinger a consumer-spending push that's likely to extend West Germany's current economic boom. Mr. Walter predicts that the economy will grow 4% this year and at least 3% in 1990. &quot;The influx is adding strength,&quot; he said.    As the East bloc arrivals earn and consume more, the effects will carry well into the next decade. &quot;There was an underlying assumption that the German economy would grow at about 2.7% in the 1990s,&quot; said Krafft Holtz, head of Euroeconomics, a forecasting and consulting firm based in London. &quot;That should be increased. You'll see a growth pattern of the economy rising by about 3.3%, at least through the early 1990s.&quot;    By extending the growth phase of the West German economic cycle, the emigration wave may lock in another trend that economists consider to be healthy: syncopated economic cycles. As the U.S. and British economies slow down, the German economy -- and closely tied European economies -- stays robust, keeping the world out of a collective slump.    The expected surge in West Germany's domestic demand will also help shrink world trade imbalances. For years, the U.S., which runs a huge trade deficit, and various international organizations, have been jawboning West Germany to step up domestic consumption and shrink its current-account surplus, which totaled 85.2 billion marks last year ($42.8 million).    A consumption boom could do that. Deutsche Bank's Mr. Walter estimates that next year, as the new arrivals purchase more clothing, durable goods and household products, imports will shoot up 7%.    The risk is that the rally will turn into a binge. Perennially fretful of inflation, the West German Bundesbank would be expected to raise interest rates to cool the economy off. That could force other European nations to increase their base rates to avoid a slide in their own currencies relative to the mark. In the case of Britain, where base rates already stand at 14%, another increase could shove the economy into a recession.    The new West Germans, 32% of whom are under 18, mitigate another national problem -- a graying population. Showing one of the world's lowest birth rates, West Germany faces a growing proportion of citizens over 65 and a shrinking population of younger people still active in the work force. According to some demographic estimates, West Germany can expect nearly 30% of its population to be 65 or older by the year 2040.    &quot;It could remedy many of the structural, long-term demographic instabilities,&quot; says Robin Mitra, an analyst with Salomon Brothers in London. Mr. Holtz predicts that by 1995, West Germany's population could rise to 65 million, instead of dropping below 60 million, as was predicted before the deterioration in Eastern bloc countries spurred mass emigrations. Its 1989 population has been estimated at 60.2 million.    West German economics minister Helmut Haussmann said in a statement earlier this week that the emigrants will bring &quot;additional burdens on public finances&quot; initially. Outside the flood of relatively well-trained East Germans, many of the ethnic Germans arrive with a poor command of the language and few marketable skills. They will require considerable training before they can be absorbed in the economy.    Moreover, the fact that the West German population will be growing instead of shrinking will likely force new investments in roads, water services and power plants.    Heavier investment at home will probably mean that the West Germans will have less money to invest in other countries. With high exports driving up the German current-account surpluses, West Germany is one of the world major creditors, pushing up investment in allied European nations. With more projects seeking funds at home, this pattern could change also.    ---   Terence Roth in Frankfurt contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
