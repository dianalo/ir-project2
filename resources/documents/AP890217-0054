Sudan said it had repelled a rebelattack in the area.   A Sudan People's Liberation Army leader, Lam Akol, refused tolist rebel casualties in the battle Tuesday in Liria, near thesouthern provincial capital of Juba.   Akol said ``about 75 percent'' of the 1,000 government troopsdefending Liria were killed or wounded.   On Wednesday, the Sudanese army command reported a rebel attackon a military convoy on a highway heading northwest of town. Thearmy statement said the rebels killed five soldiers and injured 14,but it claimed the army ``was able to inflict heavy losses on therebels, who were forced to flee.''   There was no independent verification of the claims.   Liria is about 45 miles southeast of Juba, which is a prime rebeltarget. Between Liria and Juba is the government-held town ofNgalangala and the White Nile river.   ``We control 95 percent of southern Sudan. We are interested incapturing the other 5 percent,'' Akol said.   Rebels late last month captured the Upper Nile town of Nasirafter months of siege. Nasir is 500 miles south of Khartoum and 20miles from the Ethiopian border.   The rebel radio, believed to broadcast from Ethiopia's capital,Addis Ababa, said the main rebel leader, John Garang, led the attackon Nasir.   Garang was a Sudanese army colonel before he organized the rebelgroup in 1983. He launched the rebellion against theMoslem-dominated Khartoum government to press for greater autonomyand economic reforms in the largely Christian and animist southernprovinces of Bahr el-Ghazal, Upper Nile and Equatoria.   In November, the rebels and the Democratic Unionist Partynegotiated a peace agreement that was later rejected by PrimeMinister Sadek Mahdi's government.   The November agreement called on Mahdi to lift the state ofemergency, suspend application of Islamic law and convene aconstitutional conference by Dec. 31. The rebels agreed to aceasefire.   At the time of the negotiations, the Democratic Unionist Partywas a coalition partner in Mahdi's government. However, the partyleft the coalition after the government rejected the agreement.   Mahdi then reorganized his Cabinet, giving greater power to theNational Islamic Front, which advocates Islamic law and opposes anyagreement with the rebels.   The reported fall of Liria came while a three-man DemocraticUnionist Party delegation was meeting with rebel officials in AddisAbaba.   ``We were exploring the best ways of bringing about theagreement,'' Akol said. ``Ways to mobilize the people to force theKhartoum government to implement the agreement.''   Akol said the two parties did not discuss recent calls for acease-fire by Mahdi and Secretary of State James A. Baker III.</TEXT></DOC>
