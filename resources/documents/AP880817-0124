In support of an estimated 3,000 colleagues striking for asecond day at the July Manifesto mine in Jastrzebie, workers at thenearby Morcinek mine refused today to take up their tools andlaunched their own occupation strike.   Port workers occupied the docks in Szezecin, about 250 milesnorthwest of Warsaw, and set up a 15-member strike committee, saidJan Kostecki, a leader of the independent union federation.   A local prosecutor immediately declared the strike illegal,Solidarity officials said.   Andrzej Andrzejczak, head of the Morcinek mine strike committee,said: ``We support all of the demands of the July Manifesto mineworkers.''   The mine is about 12 miles south of July Manifesto, wherestrikers were demanding legalization of the outlawed independentlabor federation, pay raises and reinstatement of workers fired fortrade union activites.   Police ringing July Manifesto, one of Poland's largest coalmines, today turned away area residents who tried to bring food tothe strikers.   Andrzejczak said the Morcinek miners broke off talks withmanagement when they were refused access to loudspeakers andcontact with the strikers at July Manifesto. He said miners erecteda large Polish flag atop the administration building and wereblocking the complex's main entrance.   It was not immediately known how many workers were involved.   The second strike came as Solidarity strike committee membersmet with management and representatives of the Industry Ministry atthe July Manifesto colliery.   Adam Kowalczyk, a regional Solidarity leader, said more workerswere joining colleagues inside by leaping over police barricades.   The strike committee issued a communique today saying theworkers would not end their stoppage until their demands are metand charged: ``The mine management is trying to end the strike byhunger.''   Police surrounded the mine after workers put down their tools onTuesday. Witnesses said about 600 officers were outside and about3,000 strikers inside.   The strikes mark the eighth anniversary of the birth of theSolidarity, which Communist authorities crushed in a 1981 militarycrackdown.   Miners leaving July Manifesto this morning said wage demandswere based on hardships caused by Poland's worsening economy,including 60 percent inflation.   ``The economy is in ruins,'' one told The Associated Press.``Miners cannot live on their salaries because of recent pricehikes.''   Miners earn nearly twice the average national salary and receiveextra benefits because of the vital role they play in the economy.Poland is the world's fourth largest exporter of coal, and coal isthe nation's leading export.   July Manifesto, a hotbed of labor activism during the strikewave that spawned Solidarity, is one of five coal mines in theregion.   Solidarity adviser Jacek Kuron said there were no reports ofviolence and police made no attempt to move into the mine, which is280 miles southwest of Warsaw and employs about 9,000 workers.   The state-run PAP news agency, in a dispatch late Tuesday, saidthe strike was illegal. PAP said the miners were warned that ``theymay be held responsible for their illegal actions.''   The July Manifesto mine is in Silesia, Poland's industrialheartland.   Eight years ago, a wave of mine strikes in Silesia ended withthe signing at July Manifesto of the last of three agreements thatestablished Solidarity across the nation. The pact also wonwork-free weekends.   Solidarity leaders said the strike began Tuesday when overnightshift workers refused to take up their tools. They were joined byworkers arriving for the morning shift, Kuron said.   Kuron said mine management then locked out members of theafternoon shift to prevent them from joining the strike.   Solidarity spokesmen said workers at the nearby Borynia minestaged a brief sympathy rally but went back to work Tuesdayafternoon.   Also Tuesday, security officials briefly detained 10 Solidarityactivists at the Rudna copper mine near the city of Wroclaw inlower Silesia.   That mine has also been the scene of unrest in recent months,where workers have demanded improved safety conditions.   Five strikes in Poland from April 25 to May 10, and briefstoppages or strike threats in 25 more work places, constituted theworst labor unrest in the country since the 1981 martial-lawcrackdown. One of the stoppages, at a steel mill near Krakow, wasbroken up by security forces.   The workers in those strikes also demanded the legalization ofSolidarity, along with wage increases.</TEXT></DOC>
