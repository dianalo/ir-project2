In a letter in this week's issue of the British medical journal Lancet, the researchers said they found evidence of AIDS virus infection in the urine of 79 of 80 patients who also tested positive in blood tests.    Urine samples taken from these patients contained antibodies usually produced in the presence of the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome, the researchers said.    In an interview, Alvin Friedman-Kien, professor of dermatology and microbiology at New York University Medical Center, said the detection of antibodies in urine should allow for the development of a urine-based test for AIDS infection.    Such a test will be less expensive &quot;and a more acceptable way to screen huge numbers of people, especially in Africa and South America, where people are reluctant to give blood samples,&quot; he said.    Antibodies to HIV have been detected in saliva, semen and other human fluids -- but never before in urine. Dr. Friedman-Kien, an established AIDS researcher, and his colleagues identified the antibodies using detection methods used to identify antibody presence in blood.    Dr. Friedman-Kien said NYU is seeking a patent for the technique and is negotiating with several companies to license the process for use in a urine-based test. He suggested the technique might allow for development of a &quot;dipstick&quot; type of test that could be performed easily by health care providers, or even at home.    The researcher declined to name the companies and referred inquiries to other university officials, none of whom could be reached for comment. Companies that make blood-based AIDS antibody tests include Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, Ill.; Du Pont Co., Wilmington, Del.; and Bristol-Myers Co., New York.    Researchers hadn't previously searched urine for the presence of HIV antibodies, Dr. Friedman-Kien said, because blood-borne viruses, such as the one that causes AIDS, usually don't produce antibodies in urine.    The antibody presence in urine, he said, &quot;is difficult to explain.&quot; He suggested that people infected with HIV may somehow excrete antibodies for fighting the disease, one possible reason that the body is unable to adequately fend off the virus.    Explaining the antibodies' presence in urine may lead to further explanations about how the HIV virus works, he said.    Officials at the government's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, which oversees much government-backed AIDS research, couldn't be reached for comment.    Late last week, the Food and Drug Administration said it didn't want to approve any home-based AIDS test, saying such tests are more appropriately handled at medical centers. It made the statement in response to companies seeking to provide tests based on blood samples. </TEXT></DOC>
