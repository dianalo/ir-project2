Hodel said that soon-departing Attorney Gen. Edwin Meese IIIconcurs with a legal opinion by Interior solicitor Ralph Tarr thatCongress must specifically award water to a wilderness area when itcreates the no-development enclave.   ``This is a public resource giveaway of monumentalproportions,'' said Debbie Sease of the Sierra Club. ``Hodel andMeese are sacrificing the lifeblood of our wilderness areas _ water_ by saying, `Come and get it, we won't defend it.'''   Hodel noted that U.S. District Court rulings disagree on a majorquestion in the arid West: Does the mere creation of a wildernessarea by Congress guarantee it will have enough water to ensure itsproper management.   He said the administration was siding with a recent ruling inNew Mexico that said there are no water rights unless Congresswrites them into wilderness legislation.   Congress has been skirting the controversial issue in wildernessbills, leaving it up to to the Interior and Agriculture departmentsand the courts to settle conflicting demands for scarce water.   ``In most cases, these wilderness bills would not have passed ifCongress had to take water away from someone,'' Hodel said. ``Inorder to get this water, you have to take it away from someoneelse.''   Under the administration policy, the rights of existing waterusers, including federal forests, parks and wilderness areas andIndian tribes, wold be maintained and protected, according to Hodel.   He indicated that new areas lacking specific statutory waterguarantees will have to compete for water with other users beforevarious state water allotment authorities.   Sen. Steve Symms, R-Idaho, said that ``the people who live alongthe banks of the Snake River are much better qualified to makedecisions about water use than the people who live along the banksof the Potomac River.''   ``This is an important decision for all of us in the West,''added Sen. Jake Garn, R-Utah. Sen. James McClure, R-Idaho, said thepolicy ``will help us resolve an issue that has confounded us.''   Hodel's announcement was immediately attacked by environmentalgroups and by Sen. Tim Wirth, D-Colo., who called the newsconference a political event because it reiterated a position theadministration has previously taken.   ``The current administration feels threatened in the Westbecause of the all-out offensive by (Democratic presidentialnominee) Michael Dukakis,'' said Wirth, who sat in the audience atthe news conference.   ``This is the first time I've seen a full-blown press conferenceon a solicitor's opinion,'' Wirth said. ``This doesn't solveanything except inflame things politically.''   The policy runs counter to a U.S. District Court ruling inColorado in 1985 and to a 1979 opinion by an Interior Departmentsolicitor during the Carter administration, said Maggie Fox of theSierra Club.   ``This marks a new low in Meese's and Hodel's flagrant disregardfor the law,'' she said.   ``The spirit of James Watt is alive and well,'' said WildernessSociety vice president Sydney Butler, referring to theadministration's first interior secretary.   Christopher Meyer, a water lawyer for the National WildlifeFederation, said that ``the decision reflects just about as muchcareful thought as the administration's decision to sell arms toIran.''   Hodel said the policy has ``the distinct possibility'' ofextending beyond the current administration.</TEXT></DOC>
