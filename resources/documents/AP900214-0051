Earlier Tuesday, leftist guerrillas kidnapped two Americans toprotest President Bush's planned visit this week to the coastalresort city of Cartagena and said they would put their captives ontrial, police said.   One was later released.   Anti-Bush demonstrators took to the streets in Cartagena, whereabout 1,000 union members marched, and in Bogota, where policefired tear gas at about 100 rock-throwing students. No injurieswere reported.   The drug traffickers said they would turn over three labs thathave produced 21 tons of cocaine monthly as a ``contribution to ourdecision to fight for peace and strenghtening of democracy inColombia.''   They said they would also surrender 15,000 55-gallon drums ofether, acetone and other chemicals used to refine cocaine.   The offer, in a written statement Tuesday night in the cocainetrafficking center of Medellin, appeared to be another effort toforce the government to end its war on drugs and stop extraditingtraffickers to the United States.   The communique was signed by ``The Extraditables,'' as themembers of the Medellin cartel call themselves, and distributed toradio stations and newspapers. It did not give a location for thechemicals or the three laboratories.   A report by the Caracol radio network said the traffickers hadgiven the locations to a group of journalists in Medellin. Thereport from Medellin provided no additional details, and it couldnot be immediately confirmed.   The communique made no reference to Bush's visit. Extraditionreportedly is high on the agenda of the summit.   Bush is scheduled to arrive in Cartagena on Thursday. Securityis tight; there have been reports the Medellin cartel might try toassassinate him.   Presidents Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia and Alan Garcia of Peruare to arrive in Cartagena later today and briefly meet withPresident Virgilio Barco.   The two Americans abducted Tuesday were identified as DavidKent, a 40-year-old teacher from Indianapolis, and James ArcherDonnelly, a 65-year-old businessman from Detroit.   Donnelly was kidnapped with his Colombian wife and the two werereleased unhurt about three hours later in Medellin, said Lt.Eusabio Guerrero, a police spokesman from the city.   An official at the school where Kent teaches, speaking oncondition of anonymity, said Donnelly was told by his captors thatthey were leftist guerrillas and had taken the action to protestBush's visit.   The kidnappings were certain to fuel concerns, already high,over Bush's security. Two U.S. ships are patrolling off theColombian coast: the USS Nassau, an 820-foot amphibious assaultship that carries helicopters and an 1,700-man Marine landing team,and the USS Sampson, a 437-foot destroyer, according to thePentagon.   Caracol said its Medellin station received a telephone call froma man who said he was a spokesman for leftist guerrillas andclaimed responsibility for the abductions. The caller said the menwould be put on trial and would be released in five days, Caracolsaid. He did not explain why there would be a trial or why the menwould be released.   A police spokesman said the kidnappers were from the NationalLiberation Army, a leftist guerrilla group. There was no way toconfirm the claim; drug traffickers have in the past posed asleftist insurgents.   The traffickers' move for peace is only the latest in a seriessince the government declared all-out war on the country's cocainebarons in August. The drug bosses have been blamed for 262terrorist acts since that have clamed 209 lives. Most have beenbombings.   The bombings include the downing of a Colombian airliner inwhich 107 people were killed.   Fourteen suspected traffickers have been extradited to theUnited States in the last five months.   In December, an army unit killed Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha,considered number two of the cartel.   Barco has said repeatedly he will never negotiate with the druglords.</TEXT></DOC>
