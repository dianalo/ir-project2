It wants to fill them with radioactive rags,gloves and clothing.   Company officials believe that if they can prove thatlow-level radioactive refuse can be safely stored belowground, Westinghouse will win a significant edge in a muchlarger venture: disposal of highly radioactive refuse andwaste.</LP><TEXT>   For Westinghouse, burying radioactive garbage represents apotentially profitable niche in its core nuclear business,which has been flat on its back for more than a decade. TheU.S. still lacks a comprehensive system for disposal ofradioactive nuclear paraphernalia, including spent fuel rodsfrom both government and commercial reactors. IfWestinghouse's desert crypts prove a safe resting place fornuclear refuse, it could open up a potential market of morethan $100 billion over the next few decades, analysts say.   Company officials hope, moreover, that successfulresolution of the garbage issue could pave the way forrenewed construction of commercial nuclear power plants. Thecompany hasn't had any significant orders to build nuclearplants in two decades, largely because of concern about plantsafety. &quot;We believe this project would demonstrate thecontinued viability of nuclear power,&quot; says LaMar Trego,Westinghouse's general manager at the site.   The market already has big significance for Westinghouse.Over the next four years, the U.S. government proposes tospend more than $20 billion for managing wastes it hascollected and temporarily stored at nuclear weaponsfacilities around the country. Analysts expect the governmentto spend even more for permanent disposal of the wastes.   As a result, Westinghouse is racing to show that itsproposed burial methods are superior to those on drawingboards or than above-ground disposal techniques currentlyused by units of Waste Management Inc. and American EcologyCorp.   But the radioactive garbage business is fraught withrisks. Citizens groups are demanding that wastes be closelymonitored and exhumed if problems are detected decades afterinterment.   In New Mexico, Westinghouse appears to be financiallyshielded because the project is funded and overseen by theU.S. Energy Department. Located about 26 miles from Carlsbad,the project -- essentially a sophisticated salt mine -- hascost the federal government about $1 billion and has anannual budget of about $135 million.   Westinghouse believes that the site also has built-insafeguards. The honeycomb of crypts was bored into a 225million-year-old salt bed after geological surveys showed thearea was very stable. The salt itself continues to growcrystals and moves around like a natural plastic wrap.   Over time, Westinghouse officials believe, the buriedwastes would be sealed by the salt. The undergroundgraveyard, they add, could be expanded almost indefinitelybecause the salt formation extends over hundreds of miles.   Above ground, Westinghouse already has built a plant toreceive wastes brought in by truck in large thermos-likecasks. About 97% of incoming garbage would emit onlylow-level radiation, which means that it could be safelyhandled in wooden or metal containers. However, one area ofthe plant has four-foot thick walls and robotics to shieldworkers from exposure to higher-level radioactive wastes.   Westinghouse officials contend that the crypts couldaccept refuse as early as next year. But citizens groups havequestioned whether any company can ensure that buried wasteswon't be disturbed -- by explorers looking for oil, forinstance, or through forces such as moisture in the salt orgases created by the buried garbage.   Officials at Westinghouse claim citizens have little toworry about. Yet opposition continues, and some criticssuggest that the area should be marked with a giant pyramidto warn away people hundreds of years from now.   &quot;People don't trust the promises that the companies aremaking,&quot; says Marvin Resnikoff, of the Radio Active WasteCampaign, a New York activist organization. Much of themistrust, he says, stems from sloppy handling of wastes inthe past.   American Ecology was scrutinized in the 1970s when it wasdiscovered that its employees combed through radioactivemilitary garbage that was slated for burial. They pilferedtools, plywood and even a cement mixer and used them inbuilding water troughs, chicken houses and the concrete floorof a Nevada tavern. Afterwards, everything was dismantled andburied at great expense.   Now companies must adhere to stricter guidelines onaccounting for radioactive garbage as well as the handlingand disposal of wastes. One Westinghouse rival, US Ecology, aunit of American Ecology, estimates that its preconstructioncosts for a planned low-level radioactive dump in Nebraskawill total $50 million. That's because wastes will be storedin above-ground reinforced concrete warehouses that thecompany claims can withstand earthquakes and 290mile-per-hour winds.   What's more, environmentalists are demanding thatcompanies ante up funds for possible future problems. Butjust how much money is sufficient is difficult to calculate.In the case of high-level wastes, the decay process usuallytakes thousands of years. Even most low-level wastes don'tdecay for about a century.</TEXT></DOC>
