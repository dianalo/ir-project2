In Lima, two policemen were shot and killed Saturday as theywalked their beat in a working class neighborhood, according toofficials.   Police blamed both attacks on members of the Maoist Shining Pathmovement, which has been fighting for eight years to topple thegovernment.   About 30 guerrillas attacked the farming community of Aranhuayon Wednesday and ordered some 200 people to attend a ``trial'' inthe village square, police reported.   They said gunmen, wearing Peruvian army uniforms, pulled 20 menfrom the crowd and shot them after accusing them of being membersof a self-defense patrol.   Aranhuay is 30 miles north of Ayacucho, which is 230 milessoutheast of Lima. Police said the account of the massacre camefrom peasants who fled to Ayacucho seeking protection.   They said the refugees told them the guerrillas were seeking toavenge the deaths of three Shining Path members killed when theAranhuay peasant patrol aided army troops in a clash with rebels inFebruary.   The Shining Path has killed hundreds of members of self-defensepatrols since the units were organized by the military in 1984.   Civil rights groups and opposition politicians have accused themilitary of abandoning the patrols, which are frequently armed onlywith pitchforks and knives.   The government says more than 10,000 people, including nearly600 policemen, have been killed in violence related to the ShiningPath insurgency.</TEXT></DOC>
