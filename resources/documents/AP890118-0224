(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Attorneys who want to save Theodore Bundyfrom Florida's electric chair next week filed a Circuit Court appealWednesday, and a hearing was scheduled for Thursday morning, courtofficials said.   ``They've raised three claims for relief,'' said CarolynSnurkowski, chief death penalty attorney for Florida's attorneygeneral office.   Two of the arguments deal with Bundy's murder convictions in thedeaths of two sorority sisters at Florida State University, Ms.Snurkowski said. The third deals with Bundy's mental state.   Bundy, 42, is scheduled to die Tuesday for the February 1978murder of Kimberly Leach, a 12-year-old Lake City girl.   His lawyers say the question of Bundy's sanity is not settledthough the U.S. Supreme Court refused Tuesday to consider the issuein the Lake City case.   The lawyers say that Bundy's two other Florida cases should belinked to the Lake City case on the question of his sanity. Bundy,42, also is under death sentences for fatally bludgeoning twoFlorida State University sorority sisters three weeks before Leachwas killed.   In 1979, Bundy was declared legally sane to stand trial for thesorority murders. That ruling was used recently by appeals courts toreject Bundy's claim that he is insane and should not be executedfor the Leach murder.   On Dec. 12, U.S. District Judge William Zloch in Fort Lauderdalereopened the sanity issue in the sorority case, saying he would hearevidence as early as Monday.   Bundy's lawyers say that decision leaves Bundy's sanity in doubtand that he should not be executed until it is resolved.   Defense lawyers and prosecutors have asked for a delay in thefederal court hearing while they deal with the death warrant.</TEXT></DOC>
