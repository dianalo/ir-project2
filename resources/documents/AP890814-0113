There was no indication, however, that the Bush administrationwas preparing any new diplomatic initiative to try to force thewarring factions to the negotiating table. Instead, the StateDepartment again deferred to the Arab League as being in the bestposition to seek a settlement in the 14-year civil war betweenMuslim and Christian forces.   The condemnation of Syria, whose hold on Lebanese territoryappears to be expanding, was delivered by spokesman Richard Boucherat the department's daily press briefing.   An official who requested anonymity said the U.S. concern hadbeen conveyed to the Syrians ``in recent meetings in Damascus.''   Boucher told reporters that ``Syria-supported forces have joinedthe latest round of fighting in Lebanon.   ``This represents an irresponsible escalation of the violence.Syria and its allies should refrain from any further escalation andaccept immediately international and Arab League calls for acease-fire and a lifting of the blockade'' of Christian ports.   At the same time, Boucher urged the Christians to observe acease-fire and to join in the ``political reconstruction'' of thecountry. This means, in effect, agreeing to power-sharingarrangements with Muslims that would reduce Christian Maroniteinfluence in the country.   The United States has turned to Syria, as well as a number ofother parties including the Soviet Union, in the latest effort tofree the eight Americans believed to be held hostage in southernLebanon.   But Boucher said that ``clearly the unsettled situation in Beirutmakes the situation regarding the hostages more difficult.'' He didnot elaborate.   In the past, Syria has played an occasionally helpful role onbehalf of captive Americans and earned U.S. expressions ofgratitude. It has also been the target of now-lifted sanctionsimposed after the State Department concluded that Damascus hadsupported terrorism.   Apart from its dominant position in Lebanon, Syria is the onlymajor Arab ally of Iran. Shiite supporters of Iran are believed tobe holding all the American hostages.   Large-scale ground fighting over the weekend carried the latest,five-month spate of violence in Lebanon to bloodier heights. Muslimand leftist militia aligned with Syria mounted an offensive near Sukal Gharb, eight miles east of Beirut, and broke through the defenselines of Christian forces led by Gen. Michael Aoun.   Iraq, an implacable foe of Syria, is aiding the Christians intheir faltering attempts to stem the Muslim advance.   Boucher, in response to a question, reiterated U.S. support forthe territorial integrity of Lebanon. Asked what the Bushadministration might do next if Syria did not relent, the U.S.official said:   ``We have to see where we go next. That's a job for the wholeinternational community.''   He said the United States was engaged in a ``broad-based effort''to support peace-making efforts of the U.N. Security Council andFrance, as well as of the Arab League.   ``We are actively involved,'' Boucher said. But, he repeated,``the Arab League is in the best position to bring about somesolution to the problems of Lebanon.''</TEXT></DOC>
