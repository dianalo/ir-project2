Tokyo's Nikkei Index of 225 issues gained 47.38 points to32087.76, after falling 336.42 points Tuesday.   In early trading in Tokyo Thursday, the Nikkei index addedanother 51.33 points to 32139.09.   Wednesday's volume on the first section was estimated at400 million shares, up from 335 million shares Tuesday.Advancers outpaced decliners 492 to 446, while 193 issueswere unchanged.   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in thefirst section gained 12.87 points, or 0.55%, to 2366.80. Thesecond section index rose 2.52 points, or 0.06%, to 4147.58on volume estimated at 23 million shares, off from 24.5million shares Tuesday.   Trading yesterday morning was lackluster, as softer yenand bond performances led to unenthusiastic activity, whilescattered arbitrage buying lent some support.   But traders said that professional investors siftedthrough prospects for strong research-oriented companies,buying shares that also seemed underpriced.   The bargain hunting on incentive-backed issues remainedstrong all day, as dealers passed the shares on to theircustomers, who lured in the broader market, observers said.   One domestic trader mentioned that talk among dealers inthe morning included theories that foreign investors,particularly from the U.S., will get out of long cashpositions overseas and place their money in Japanese stocks.&quot;Especially in New York, many feel the market is overheatedand won't be improving for some time,&quot; he said.   The Japanese trader felt that some dealers acted on thespeculation, resulting in the initial buying onincentive-backed issues.   On the other hand, financial conditions haven't reallyturned to favor yen investments, observers noted.   From an equity point of view, the dollar-yen rate has beentrapped in an unattractive range for some time, with littlesign of breaking out of its range, traders said.   &quot;There's a very interesting tug-of-war going on&quot; with therelationship between the markets, said Julian Jones, anequity salesman at W.I. Carr, Sons andamp; Co. The battle increasesinvestors' attention to bond-yield movements.   The market is unlikely to make any large movement until itreceives a firm indication of the currency's direction, Mr.Jones said.   Arbitrage and other types of index-linked buying,meanwhile, is keeping the market from falling on weakfundamentals, traders said. Morgan Stanley, Salomon Brothersand Baring Securities were underlined as key players.   A chief trader at a midsized Japanese securities firmsubmitted that yesterday was the settlement date for pensionfund assessment, so firms would naturally push for a higherresult on the cash index, he said.   Notable gainers included NTT, which advanced 70000 yen to1.15 million yen ($456 to $7,494). According to a local newsservice report, the company's chairman hinted that there ispotential for a gratis issue.   Tokyo Steel rose 100 yen to 4950 yen, while Fuji PhotoFilm gained 100 yen to 4390 yen, both boosted byincentive-backed dealer buying, traders said.   Fujisawa Pharmaceutical, which Tuesday disclosed news on anew drug to be targeted for testing in the U.S., SovietUnion, Japan and Western Europe, rose 70 yen to 2100 yen.   In London, dealers said institutional investors generallyhave stated that they're content with the profits they havemade so far during the second quarter and are awaiting thestart of the next quarter for any new investment.   In addition, the running of the Royal Ascot horse racekept many participants out of the market, dealers said, asdid a mediocre start to Wall Street and a dearth of majorU.K. corporate or economic news.   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index gained1.5 points to 2371.2, off the midmorning best level of2384.5, but well above the early morning minimum of 2369.6.   The Financial Times 30 Share Index fell 4 points to1903.4. Volume reached a sketchy 436.8 million shares,compared with 408.3 million issues Tuesday.   Among the major losers on the day was Imperial ChemicalIndustries, Britain's largest chemical concern. The stockfell 30 pence to #11.82 (52 cents to $20.37) on news that theU.S. Commerce Department is suing eight corporations,including an ICI unit, for allegedly polluting the coastalwaters off California.   Also falling was drug maker Wellcome, which shed 34 penceto 633 pence after an earnings downgrade by brokerage firmS.G. Warburg, and worries over emerging competition for thecompany's Retrovir drug used to combat the effects of the HIVvirus.   Defense stocks continued to tailspin after the Britishgovernment Monday said it is canceling an order for 33Tornado aircraft. British Aerospace lost 26 pence to 520pence, GEC shed 11 pence to 197 pence, Rolls-Royce slipped 2pence to 215 pence, while Vickers dropped a penny to 232pence.   Food and dairy group Unigate rose 7 pence to 312 pence,after reporting a 5% rise for fiscal 1990 to #105.5 million,exceeding market forecasts.   Hambros, a banking and financial services concern,increased 3 pence to 286 pence, after it reported a 10%increase in pretax profit for the fiscal year.
