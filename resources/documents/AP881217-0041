The departure of the fleet was delayed more than a week whileJapan tried to lessen U.S. opposition to the research plan.   ``We wanted to show the United States that Japan is proceedingseriously, within the provisions of the charter of the InternationalWhaling Commission,'' one official said, speaking on condition ofanonymity.   Last spring, the U.S. government banned Japanese fishing boatsfrom U.S. waters because of the whaling research, which it chargedwas ``diminishing the effectiveness'' of a moratorium on commercialwhaling imposed in 1986 by the 42-member Whaling Commission.   ``Basic differences remain between the two sides,'' anotherofficial said, also speaking on condition he not be named. ``Webelieve that we have done everything possible to try to get theUnited States to understand our position.''   The efforts included visits by Japanese officials to the UnitedStates and contacts by embassy officials in Washington, he said.   Japan, the world's biggest consumer of whale meat, officiallyended its commercial whaling in the Antarctic at the end of the1986-87 season, after it caught 1,941 whales.   Last season it announced it would kill 875 whales for researchpurposes but reduced that to 300 after international environmentalgroups charged the research program was ``commercial whaling indisguise.''   Officials say Japanese whalers last year actually caught 273whales, all minkes, a variety not in immediate danger of extinction.   ``From our perspective, some groups in the United States havebeen taking the whaling issue to an extreme, turning it into a moralquestion rather than a scientific question,'' the second officialsaid. ``Japanese people don't see why you shouldn't kill even oneminke whale if more than 700,000 currently exist, and don't believethat eating whales makes you a barbarian.''   The whaling commission passed the commercial whaling moratoriumto give scientists a chance to evaluate whale stocks. The moratoriumis to be evaluated in 1990 on the basis of the research findings.   Under the commission's charter, each member country is able toconduct whaling research whenever it wishes. However, environmentalgroups have charged Japan is using that clause as a way to getaround the whaling ban and maintain its whaling industry.   Japanese officials, in turn, charge other commission members havenot been seriously conducting research during the moratorium periodand plan merely to renew the ban in 1990. Only a minority ofcommission members are whaling nations.   Japanese officials say a representative sampling of whales mustbe killed to accurately study their age, sex, diet and health.Anti-whaling groups say other research methods are available thatdon't involve killing.   Japan hopes the research will prove there are sufficient numbersof some whale species, such as the minke, to allow resumption oflimited commercial whaling in 1990.</TEXT></DOC>
