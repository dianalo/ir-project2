The move will affect about 10% of the company's overallcigarette sales, in markets such as Thailand, thePhilippines, the Dominican Republic, Morocco and Yugoslavia.</LP><TEXT>   The policy change was disclosed by the Rev. MichaelCrosby, a spokesman for the Midwest Province of the CapuchinOrder, which owns shares in Philip Morris and has beenpushing such a move. Fr. Crosby said adoption of the policywas contingent on the order withdrawing its plan to introducea similar resolution in this year's annual shareholdersmeeting.   A spokesman for Philip Morris said the company had beencontemplating such a move but couldn't confirm that it hadmade the policy change. However, he played down thesignificance of the move because most of its cigarettepackages already contain such warnings.   With the U.S. cigarette business shrinking, Americantobacco merchants are depending more and more oninternational sales. Total tobacco revenue for Philip Morriswas $23.84 billion last year, with $12.28 billion coming fromoverseas markets.   Scott Ballin of the American Heart Association inWashington said he saw Philip Morris's move as an effort toblunt anti-smoking sentiment -- and any possible restrictivelegislation that could result -- in potentially rich ThirdWorld markets. He cites the company's plan, contained in adocument sent to the Capuchin friars, to initially useEnglish warning labels &quot;until such time as dialogue withagencies of the local governments in question result inwarnings calling for different content and/or language.&quot;   &quot;It's a strategy on their part to ensure that theycontinue to have some say over the labeling of tobaccoproducts,&quot; said Mr. Ballin.   Brenda Follmer, spokeswoman for R.J. Reynolds TobaccoInternational, the international tobacco unit of RJR NabiscoHoldings Inc., said the nation's second-largest tobaccomarketer is also considering including health warning labelson all of its cigarette packages.   &quot;As everybody's international business grows, we're alllooking at this issue,&quot; said Ms. Follmer.   Ms. Follmer says more than 100 countries already requirewarning labels, with the U.S. and some Scandinavian countrieshaving the toughest requirements. She says labeling hasbecome a growing issue as some of the Eastern Europeanmarkets open for the first time to U.S. companies.   Like the Philip Morris officials, Ms. Follmer plays downthe importance of the decision: &quot;Because so many countriesalready require warning labels, I just don't see this as abig issue.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
