Baker III hasopened talks with China's ambassador here in an effort to resolvethe case of two dissidents being sheltered in the U.S. Embassy inBeijing, it was disclosed today.   Baker called Ambassador Han Xu to his office on Saturday and theenvoy was summoned back on Sunday for another talk with RobertKimmitt, the undersecretary for political affairs, State Departmentspokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said today.   The conversations dealt with Fang Lizhi, an astrophysicist, andhis wife, Li Shuxian, an assistant professor at Beijing University.They were accused of counter-revolutionary activities and warrantsfor their arrest were issued Sunday.   `We`re trying to resolve it,'' said a senior official whodeclined to be identified.   Ms. Tutwiler, meanwhile, challenged Chinese assertions thathundreds of protesting students were not slain by army troops onJune 3.   ``The whole world has seen what happened in Tiananmen Square,''she said. ``Large numbers of peaceful demonstrators were killed byarmy units. We condemn the use of live fire against unarmedcivilians, which is what happened in Tiananmen Square.''   The spokeswoman said the demonstrators were seeking basic humanrights. ``Labeling such people counter-revolutionaries and hooliganswill do nothing to alter the reality of what happened in TiananmenSquare on June 3,'' she said.   Earlier today, the Bush administration indicated it would notpermit the Chinese to arrest the two dissidents who took refuge inthe embassy.   ``When a person presents himself to one of our embassies and sayshe is imminent danger and we have reason to give it credencesometimes we grant refuge,'' a U.S. official said. ``And when we dothat, I ask you `What does it mean?'''   The administration, in dealing with the crackdown on dissidentsand other pro-democracy forces, is trying not to inflame thesituation by denouncing Chinese authorities.   But the statement by the U.S. official, who spoke on condition ofanonymity, indicated that any attempt to arrest Fang and Li would beresisted.   The charges against the two dissidents could amount toaccusations of treason and, amid the turmoil in China, carry thethreat of a death sentence.   The Beijing government warned that leaders of independent groupswho refuse to surrender will be arrested ``and dealt with severely.''   Meanwhile, U.S.-Chinese relations have turned sour. PresidentBush has suspended military sales to Beijing and all Americansexcept diplomats were urged to leave the country.   James Lilley, the U.S. ambassador to China, said today ``thejury's still out'' on how the situation will unfold.   ``Right now we have the semblance of order and control,'' he saidon ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America.'' ``Certainly Beijing is anorderly city right now. But I think that we have to wait and see.''   Lilley declined to discuss the Fang situation, saying ``it's toosensitive... If you get up and start posturing, it lessens thechance of getting something done.''   In a separate interview with NBC-TV's ``Today'' program, Lilleysaid he hoped the dispute over Fang and Li was ``not volatile atall.''   ``We hope that it's settled and it's out of the way fairlysoon,'' he said.   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, said when askedabout Fang: ``It's our judgment it's not helpful in any way tocomment.'' He added that the administration was ``considering thissituation.''   A reporter called out a question about Fang to President Bush atthe start of a meeting with congressional leaders.   The lawmakers took that as their cue to break out into a heartychorus of ``Happy Birthday, Mr. President'' for Bush, who turned 65today. Bush laughed and reporters were quickly escorted out of theroom.</TEXT></DOC>
