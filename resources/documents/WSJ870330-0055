But he will also tell President Reagan and other officials that he worries the U.S. might be moving too far and too fast in arms-control deals with the Russians, to the detriment of Western Europe. In a 75-minute interview, Mr. Chirac said his aims for his first U.S. visit since becoming prime minister last March are threefold: to convince U.S. officials and investors of the deep and &quot;irreversible&quot; changes in the French economy over the past year, to warn against arms treaties that would weaken European defenses and to press for a more responsible approach by rich countries toward the Third World.    Despite sagging in the opinion polls recently, the conservative prime minister, who &quot;cohabits&quot; uneasily with Socialist President Francois Mitterrand, says he is confident his economic policies within five years will &quot;make France the strongest economic power in Europe,&quot; ready to compete in a unified Common Market.    In foreign affairs, Mr. Chirac says he will stress during his three-day visit to the U.S., which starts today in New York, that while France supports nuclear disarmament and a U.S.-Russian treaty on intermediate weapons, it wants any such treaty to contain strong language calling for later treaties on short-range weapons, that the nuclear &quot;linkage&quot; between Europe and the U.S. must be maintained, and that there was &quot;no possibility&quot; that France would agree to give up its independent nuclear weapons as part of a U.S.-Soviet agreement.    The prime minister looked relaxed and confident throughout the interview in his office in the 18th-century Hotel Matignon. He rose frequently to toss extra logs into the fireplace of his handsomely decorated, if chilly office. Mr. Chirac made the following main points:    On France. &quot;We are engaged in a process to liberalize the economy and we won't change our course. We will carry out the privatizing of 65 state companies in five years. We will continue to decrease our budget deficit and reduce the tax burden on businesses and individuals. We have introduced complete and total price freedom, irreversibly, and removed exchange and credit controls.&quot;    On economic stimulus. &quot;The American position to encourage those countries that have large budget surpluses {such as Japan and West Germany} to . . . open their markets more and also to stimulate growth is a good initiative.&quot; As for France: &quot;Some people here have called for stimulus of investment by tax policies. We won't do it. We don't need to, because industrial investment will grow an average of 5% to 6% this year without it, and small-business investment will be up 23%.&quot; (Among those calling for investment tax credits here is Raymond Barre, Mr. Chirac's chief rival for the presidency among conservatives.)    On trade. &quot;Europe is the most open market in the world, and free trade is the only solution that makes progress possible. We note at present, not in American policy or in the spirit of the administration, but in Congress and public opinion, certain protectionist temptations. These are sometimes to protect threatened sectors, sometimes to protect high-technology sectors. This is very disturbing to us, and I intend to say so.&quot;    On European defense. &quot;We are in favor of disarmament. We hope the negotiations between the U.S. and U.S.S.R. will make real progress possible. But the security problems of Europe must be taken into account. Our conviction is based on three ideas. For Europe, nuclear deterrence will for a long time to come remain the main means of safeguarding peace. The linkage between Western Europe and the United States is an absolute necessity. European countries must make a bigger, better-coordinated, and more consistent effort in terms of defense.&quot;    On a missile treaty. &quot;We are in favor of the decrease or the elimination of intermediate-range missiles {in Europe} on the condition that the elimination is simultaneous, balanced and verifiable. And it must not be liable to be undermined from below. That is, it must imply another agreement on short-range weapons. We also remain alert to the superiority of the Warsaw Pact in conventional and chemical weapons, although these are matters for another forum.&quot;    On French missiles. &quot;There are no circumstances in which we could accept that the French and British nuclear forces be involved in these {U.S.-Soviet} negotiations. But I note that Mr. Gorbachev is no longer asking for this, and the U.S. hasn't proposed this, either.&quot;    On the Russians. &quot;It looks as if things are moving in the Soviet Union. But for me, it hasn't come far enough to be really credible. If Mr. Gorbachev continues taking important initiatives, like withdrawal from Afghanistan and therefore respect for rights of self-determination of nations and people, and the freeing of large numbers of political prisoners, and letting Soviet Jews emigrate if they want to, then, yes, we can start talking about a new orientation that would favor a resumption of detente. But we haven't reached that state yet.&quot;    On Soviet motives. &quot;Soviet diplomacy's ambition, from the very beginning, was to neutralize Western Europe, and to decouple Europe from the U.S. But it hasn't worked, and I don't think it will. Western solidarity, within Europe on the one hand, between Europe and the U.S. on the other, remains very strong, because it's the only way to protect the values of democracy and liberty.&quot;    On his falling poll standings. &quot;I'm not worried. For the past year, despite a recovery program that has meant some sacrifices for everybody, the right-left balance hasn't changed. The {right-led} majority won't become divided. And this majority will win the presidential elections {due in 1988} and therefore will pursue the same policies.&quot;    On his goals. &quot;In 1992, if all goes well, there will be a single European market of 320 million people. What I want to achieve in five years is to make France a strong and dynamic enough economy to face successfully this new situation. Companies must reduce their debts, rebuild their assets, increase competitiveness. We must also improve the dialogue with labor and so improve conditions for national unity. We must eliminate everything that can divide us and strengthen everything that can bring us together.&quot;    On the presidential race. &quot;I'm attached to the policy we're pursuing. My main worry would be moving away abruptly from that policy. If a Socialist president were elected, that would bring everything into question. But I don't think that's likely in real terms. Therefore, the important thing is to ensure that the genuine liberal policy is continued, and, of course, I feel that the best person to pursue such a policy is the one who started it.&quot;    On the Third World. &quot;We in France are very, very worried, in fact traumatized, by the situation in poor countries, where poverty and indebtedness are increasing. We must do everything we can to reduce the egoism of the rich countries. It's very difficult, in a period of crisis, but to do nothing is a rejection of the values we defend elsewhere. We must reschedule far more systematically the debts of Third World countries, and find ways of injecting fresh money to make development possible. It's indispensable to end the scandalous speculation on prices of commodities. We {in France} have been increasing our aid for development, but it's far from enough.&quot;    Mr. Chirac's schedule for the visit, which ends Wednesday, includes seven speeches, two to business groups today in New York, and private meetings in Washington with Mr. Reagan, Vice President George Bush, Secretary of State George Shultz, Treasury Secretary James Baker, Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, and with congressional leaders. </TEXT></DOC>
