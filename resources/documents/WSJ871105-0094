In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, the MIM group, which now holds a 9.9% stake in Di Giorgio's common shares, said it has talked to people who indicated they might be interested in seeking control of the company, although no agreements have been reached so far.    Di Giorgio declined to comment on the filing or on the MIM group's intentions.    In June, a group led by New York money manager Mario Gabelli offered to acquire Di Giorgio in a leveraged buy-out valued at $28 a share, or a total of $238 million. In July, Di Giorgio issued a &quot;poison pill&quot; shareholder rights plan aimed at discouraging unwanted bids, and it later sued the Gabelli group, alleging violations of securities laws in the way the group and its affiliates amassed a 28.6% stake in the company. In August, the Gabelli group said it was giving up the bid and had lowered its stake to 27.1%.    Nicholas DeStefano, managing director at Gabelli Group Inc., New York, said Gabelli Group has had no contact with MIM regarding Di Giorgio and has no current plans to sell its stake or make another bid for Di Giorgio. On Oct. 28, Gabelli Group held roughly 26% of Di Giorgio.    Officials representing MIM, an investment advisory firm, weren't immediately available for comment. In the SEC filing, the MIM group said it had increased its stake in Di Giorgio by acquiring 254,200 additional shares from Oct. 9 to Monday for $12.87 to $24.10 a share. The purchases boosted the total shares owned by the MIM group to 841,850 shares.    Future attempts to acquire more Di Giorgio shares are likely to be considerably cheaper than in the past. Shares of the company, a food distributor with additional interests in building materials and real estate development, traded at $23 to $25 a share in the days before the stock market collapse Oct. 19. The stock's price sank 46% immediately after the crash, to $13.50 a share. Di Giorgio's shares closed yesterday at $15 a share, up 87.5 cents, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.    The MIM group said in its filing that it is considering a takeover because it believes Di Giorgio has failed to maximize shareholder value, and because of the rejection of the Gabelli offer. If it and other parties gain control of Di Giorgio, it said it would consider selling some or all of the company's assets, particularly the real-estate operation. </TEXT></DOC>
