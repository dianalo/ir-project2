The engine is assumed ideal except for friction lossesgiven as a function of the cylinder pressure. The optimization is determinedthrough calculations of thermodynamic efficiency, cylinder pressure versuscrank angle, and friction-loss characteristics. A mathematical modelis developed, and since the efficiency consists of output work over inputfuel constraint, a calculus of variations approach are used for solvingthe problem. The constraint, however, is not constant but variable. Anew approach shows, among the value of constraint, that the maximum efficiencycan be optimized. Its inverse problem, in which the output work is constraint,also can be optimized. Results of optimizing the problem show that thefuel-injection staring angle is approximately 5{sup 0} after top deadcenter regardless of the amount of fuel injection per cycle, while theending angle varies from approximately 8 to 29{sup 0} with increasingfuel injection per cycle. In a hypergolic combustion engine, since thefuel is activated, the delayed combustion is not expected. It is easyto show that the Otto cycle is optimal, only when a frictionless engineis available, but this is not practical. The results show that the Hoppiecycle is up to 10% better in comparison to the Otto cycle with friction.</TEXT></DOC>
