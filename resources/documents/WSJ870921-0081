Move Your Business toWisconsin.&quot;   The message hits at a sore spot for Chicago businesses. After six electric rate increases in 10 years -- and with another 27% boost on the table -- Commonwealth Edison Co. is beginning to weigh heavily on efforts by the &quot;City of Big Shoulders&quot; to bounce back from one of the Midwest's worst recessions.    More than a decade ago, when Commonwealth launched the largest nuclear power plant construction program in the U.S., the Chicago-based utility predicted the project would someday boost the upper Midwest's economy with plenty of inexpensive power. But high construction costs and slumping power demand have saddled customers with some of the nation's highest electric bills and the company with more than $7 billion in unfunded debt.    With more than half the country's utilities cutting their electric rates these days, Commonwealth's soaring rates are prompting some businesses to heed the billboard message of Wisconsin Electric, which is selling electricity for as much as 40% less than Commonwealth.    General Alum andamp; Chemical Corp., for example, recently decided to build a new chemical plant in Saukville, Wis., after looking over the Chicago area. &quot;Electric rates were a key factor&quot; in that decision, says James A. Poure, the chairman and president of the Toledo, Ohio-based chemical manufacturer. &quot;We looked at both places and northern Illinois had a good economic development package,&quot; Mr. Poure says. But, he adds, &quot;electricity is our major utility. Commonwealth Edison's rates hurt.&quot;    &quot;Electric rates around Chicago are horrible,&quot; adds F. Kenneth Iverson, chairman of Nucor Corp. Mr. Iverson's Charlotte, N.C.-based company bypassed Chicago in its search for a new steel plant site. Instead, it elected to put the plant, which will cost $225 million and employ some 600 workers, in Crawfordville, Ind. &quot;I expect we'll save at least 50% on our electricity costs,&quot; Mr. Iverson says.    When Armand L. Coppe went to look at a prospective new-plant site recently, the president of Litton Precision Gear Inc. says the first question he asked was, &quot;Are we still in the Commonwealth Edison service area?&quot; He was, and Mr. Coppe scratched the site off his list.    Chicago-based Litton, a maker of helicopter transmission parts, spends nearly $1 million a year on electricity and employs some 650 workers. &quot;If we could find the skilled work force we need somewhere else,&quot; Mr. Coppe says angrily, &quot;I would sure think about leaving.&quot;    Such decisions and sentiments are costing Chicago industrial jobs. While the number of jobs in northern Illinois rose a robust 18% during the first seven months of this year from a year earlier, manufacturing jobs, the backbone of Chicago's beleaguered blue-collar economy, fell nearly 2%. The soaring electric rates may be driving off more of the solid blue-collar jobs that the city would like to see restored.    Commonwealth's rates also could put a crimp in Illinois's bid for the giant federal superconducting supercollider. Illinois, one of 23 states bidding fiercely for the atom smasher that would generate 6,000 construction jobs and 2,500 permanent jobs, wants to put the project at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in the Chicago suburb of Batavia, Ill. But Illinois officials concede Commonwealth can't match Texas's promise to supply the project's huge electrical demand for just one cent a kilowatt hour.    Ironically, Commonwealth promoted its nuclear construction program back in the early 1970s as a guarantee of Chicago's industrial future. It predicted its dozen nuclear units, when completed, would produce as much as 70% of the area's power at a price well below other utilities' nonnuclear generating cost.    But the scenario was disrupted by the sharp drop in demand and the escalation in construction costs. Sophisticated opposition from consumer activists, who charge that Commonwealth's nuclear program is overbuilt and too expensive, also has hobbled the utility. Opponents have woven court and regulatory challenges to thwart Commonwealth Edison's efforts to bill consumers for its $7 billion investment in its last three plants. Commonwealth Edison says the challenges are costing it about $2 million a day in interest charges alone.    &quot;For Edison the chickens are coming home to roost,&quot; says Howard Learner, an attorney for Business and Professional People for the Public Interest, one of the utility's opponents. Mr. Learner predicts that Commonwealth shareholders will eventually have to eat much of the utility's recent nuclear investment or the utility will drive away its customer base.    Commonwealth officials insist that despite the spate of problems, the nuclear plants will eventually prove themselves. &quot;In our judgment, people will recognize there are lots of elements in providing electricity besides price,&quot; says James J. O'Connor, chairman and president.    Mr. O'Connor says reliability and an adequate power supply are more important to big industrial customers than the immediate size of their electric bills. &quot;The commercial and industrial sector makes decisions over a 20-year or 30-year time frame,&quot; he says. &quot;They're not just buying in for the next quarter or year.&quot;    Some big customers, however, are concerned. In testimony before Illinois utility regulators recently, B.W.H. Marsden, president and chief executive officer of Acme Steel Co., which employs 1,400 workers in Chicago, called electric rates &quot;crucial&quot; to his company's survival during the next five years. &quot;Every time you try to get a large corporate headquarters to move here,&quot; adds Stephen Seftenberg, an attorney who represents more than 100 office buildings in the Chicago area, &quot;one of the first things they want to know is how the electric rates will affect the cost of space.&quot;    With one-third of Commonwealth's power going to big manufacturers, industry experts say the utility can't afford to lose too many big industrial customers. Such defections, they warn, could drive up bills for remaining customers and eventually drive them away too.    Adding to that problem: Some Chicago-area businesses are leaving the utility system and making their own power through cogeneration. With cogeneration, a company uses heat from its operation to generate steam and produce electricty. It either uses the power or sells it to the local utility. Nalco Chemical Co., which switched over to cogeneration in late 1985 at its Naperville, Ill., facility, says it saved $800,000 in the first year. Commonwealth's rising rates were a big factor in the decision, says James Lloyd, Nalco's facilities manager.    But the cruelest blow could come from Chicago itself if the city carries through on its threat to go elsewhere for power after its contract with Commonwealth expires at the end of 1990. Chicago buys about one-third of Commonwealth's output, and Mayor Harold Washington has put the utility on notice that he isn't pleased with the prospect of further rate rises to pay for the nuclear plants. &quot;We're basically opposed to any increase,&quot; says Ernest Barefield, the mayor's chief of staff.    Chicago officials plan to unveil a study in the next few weeks laying out alternatives to buying power from Commonwealth. Among the options: forming a municipal power authority to buy bulk electricity elsewhere or buying some Commonwealth facilities and generating power itself. &quot;Edison has to face up to the fact that it is pricing itself out of the market,&quot; says Charles Williams, director of the city planning department's energy-management section.    So far, the city's tough talk hasn't caused the utility to back down from its rate demands. Some of that talk may just amount to an early push for lower rates in the future, since any threat to Commonwealth's overall economic well-being could backfire and worry businesses interested in coming to the city. Nonetheless, says Mr. Williams, &quot;our contract with the utility doesn't force us to be a captive customer and simply accept their continuing investment decisions and rate increases without question.&quot;    Few people expect state regulators to give Commonwealth the rate increase it seeks. The Illinois Commerce Commission rejected a plan three times this summer that would have raised the electric rates 9.6% as part of a complicated scheme to pay for the utility's new plants.    But the latest proposed 27% boost has given Commonwealth competitors plenty of ammunition. Wisconsin Energy Corp. says it uses Commonwealth's electric rates prominently in its sales pitch for its new 1,200-acre WisPark industrial park. The park sits just a mile north of the Illinois line and the edge of Commonwealth's service territory. Prospective tenants are reminded that Wisconsin Energy's Wisconsin Electric Power Co. unit has trimmed its rates three times since 1984.    &quot;Last week, a guy called and said he had to move his paint company out of Chicago because the electric bills were killing him,&quot; says Larry Weber, WisPark's general manager. Mr. Weber smiles and says he commiserated with the paint company owner and invited him up for a visit. </TEXT></DOC>
