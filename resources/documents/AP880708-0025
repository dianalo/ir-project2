M. Danny Wall, chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board,raised the ante on the bailouts Thursday, telling the House BankingCommittee that the estimated cost of dealing with the problems ofTexas thrifts would be $15.2 billion. Previously, regulators hadsaid the bill would be $7 billion.   ``Now you see it, now you don't,'' said a frustrated Rep.Fernand J. St Germain, D-R.I., chairman of the banking panel.``Watch the bouncing ball.''   ``It's called garbage in and garbage out,'' said Rep. StanParris, R-Va. ``The definition of rosy scenario is changing so fastI can't even keep up with it.''   Wall said his agency's estimate of bailout costs in Texas hadincreased because thrifts' losses, and the costs of resolving theirproblems, have been more expensive than expected. St Germain,however, said there were other factors as well.   ``Some of the problems are just plain old-fashionedmismanagement, insider dealing, fraud and high-flying excesses,exacerbated by lax supervision and hesitant enforcement,'' he said.   Many lawmakers have long been jousting with bank boardofficials, accusing them of using optimistic economic scenarios tojustify rosy cost projections.   Wall did not reveal a new projection for what it would cost tobail out all of the country's savings and loans facing financialproblems. But he said, ``We see that the resources ... can be andwould be sufficient for the size of the problem as we see it.''   Wall also told the lawmakers that his agency would be able toraise $42.5 billion over the next decade to cover insolvenciesacross the country.   The government had previously estimated that the cost ofbailouts nationally would be in the $25 billion to $30 billionrange and that the bank board would have $30.2 billion at itsdisposal to merge, sell or liquidate troubled thrifts.   Wall said that to pay for the newly estimated costs of the Texasbailouts, his agency will raise an additional $12.3 billion, mostlyby extending the special assessment the thrifts now pay on theirdeposits.   Of the country's 3,100 thrifts, the bank board has a caseload of259 that will need financial assistance from the government and hasidentified 252 others likely to need financial help.   About 60 percent of the troubled thrifts are in the Southwest.Half of those are in Texas alone, where the economy has faltered inrecent years because of falling oil prices. Until now, thegovernment had estimated it would cost $7 billion to deal with theTexas savings and loans.   The country's savings and loans hold $950 billion in deposits in100 million accounts.   The nation's thrifts lost $7.6 billion last year, making it theindustry's worst year since the Depression. In the first threemonths of this year, 133 insolvent savings and loans in Texas havelost $3.4 billion.   The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., the federalprogram that insures thrifts, spent $3.7 billion last year tohandle the insolvencies of 47 savings and loans.   Due to the increasing strains from growing numbers of bailouts,the FSLIC saw its reserve rop from $6.8 billion in 1983 to $600million last year. Congress provided $10.8 billion more for theprogram last August.</TEXT></DOC>
