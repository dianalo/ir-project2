Leo Narvaiz, 20, was taken into custody after being treated at ahospital for a stab wound to his thigh and a cut on the hand. Hewas charged with four counts of capital murder, said Robert Grego,court officer for Magistrate Quon Lew.   Narvaiz was taken back to Medical Center Hospital after alate-night hearing and will be transferred to Bexar County Jail on$4.05 million bail, Grego said.   Narvaiz had broken up with 17-year-old Shannon Mann in the pastthree weeks and had been named in two complaints filed by theteen-ager's father, one alleging a terroristic threat, saidhomicide Lt. Albert Ortiz.   Narvaiz also had threatened Miss Mann's new boyfriend with aknife last month and damaged his pickup truck, the lieutenant said.   ``He had been trying to get back with her and since he wasunable to, we figure this is what prompted him to break into thehouse and commit these murders,'' Ortiz said.   Miss Mann was found slain along with her sisters, Jenniffer, 19,and Martha, 14, and brother Ernest, 11, in their mobile home earlyFriday.   ``We figure he either surprised them in their sleep or there's apossibility that more than one person was involved, which wouldhave kept them from running out or anything like that. We can'ttell for sure,'' said Ortiz.   Ortiz said a girl called the 911 emergency number about 3:27a.m. and said ``one of my sister's boyfriends is beating us up andhas killed my sister.''   Police were able to trace the call and found the bodies at 3:55a.m., Ortiz said.   Police said at least five steak knives were used in the slayingsand that more could have been carried off from the five-bedroommobile home.   ``It's unbelievable. All of them were savagely stabbed. Thereare knives broken off in their necks,'' said Sgt. George Wilson, a28-year member of the department. ``It's a slaughterhouse.''   Mary Mireles, who lives across from the trailer park, said therehave been numerous robberies there and that she heard a commotionearly Friday, and thought she heard gunshots.   ``I heard a lot of screams,'' Mrs. Mireles said. ``They werescreaming, `Help' and they were crying and screaming and I told myhusband and he said, `No, let's not get involved.'''   ``He thought they would shoot at anybody who went out to seewhat was going on,'' she said.   The 10-acre park in a quiet neighborhood has a full-patrolsecurity system, plus a swimming pool and well-equipped recreationcenter, said Barry Byers, a supervisor for Mobile Home Park. Hedescribed residents as middle-class. ``These people have beenscreened,'' he said.   The victims' parents, Ernest and Becky Mann, are separated. Mrs.Mann was living with the children but was not home at the time ofthe attack, police said.   Police Lt. Weldon Stinson said officers were unable to determineif the girls had been sexually assaulted.   The bodies were so mutilated that police first reported thatfour girls had been killed. But Mrs. Mann later confirmed that onewas a boy. She collapsed after identifying them, police said.   At one point, the victims' father struck a television cameramanand four officers restrained him from striking a second one.   ``Get those cameras out of here. This is not a carnival!'' Mannsaid.   Janice Pope, a friend of the girls, said the family moved inabout a month ago and were known for throwing parties forneighborhood friends.   ``They loved to have fun. They just wanted some attention,'' Ms.Pope said. ``They just wanted friends.''   Yvonne Ochoa, 20, said she had worked with Shannon Mann at agrocery store until Miss Mann resigned about four months ago.   ``She wouldn't talk, but she asked me about married life andsaid she was wanting to move in with her boyfriend,'' Ms. Ochoasaid. ``They were always breaking up but she said she loved him.   ``She said that he hit her and that he also broke into her otherhouse but that she still wanted to marry him.''   Darrell Flynt, principal of McCollum High School, said Shannonwithdrew from school last November as a sophomore, and Jenniferdropped out of school in 1985 as a junior.</TEXT></DOC>
