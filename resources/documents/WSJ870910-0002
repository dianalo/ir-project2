WhiteStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 09/10/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> FAUTOS, AUTO PARTS (AUT)TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT (TRN) </IN><TEXT>   Ford Motor Co. recalled 4.3 million cars, light trucks and vans to correct fuel-system defects that have produced 230 engine fires and injured 16 people.    In the larger of two separate actions, the No. 2 auto maker recalled 4.1 million 1986-88 cars and 1986-87 light trucks -- one of the largest totals in history -- to repair couplings on the fuel lines that connect the gas tank to fuel-injected engines.    The Dearborn, Mich.-based company said 222 engine fires had been traced to improperly installed snap-on fuel-line couplings that had come loose, causing gasoline to spill in the engine compartment. Ford said eight people were injured in those fuel-line related fires.    The 4.1 million-vehicle recall represents 56% of the 7.3 million cars and light trucks Ford has built in North America since 1986.    The defects aren't expected to be costly to repair, but they are a major embarrassment at a time when Ford is riding high. The company is being widely praised for out-earning its larger archrival, General Motors Corp., and for setting new standards in quality and design. The company's most infamous recall also was fire related: The 1978 recall of 1.7 million Ford Pintos and Mercury Bobcats was to repair a defect that caused fires when gas tanks ruptured in rear-end collisions.    The fuel-line recall affects some of Ford's biggest-selling lines: The Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable midsized cars, the compact Ford Escort, the Ford F-series and Ranger pickup trucks, and the Lincoln Continental and Town Car. Other models included in the recall are the Ford Mustang, Thunderbird and LTD Crown Victoria; the Mercury Lynx, Capri, Cougar and Grand Marquis; the Lincoln Mark VII; the Bronco and Bronco II sports utility vehicles, and the Aerostar and Econoline vans.    The snap-on fuel-line couplings, or connecting valves, weren't used before Ford introduced its 1986-model fuel-injected engines, the company said. The connection wasn't cheaper than the screw-on couplings it replaced, Ford engineer John Kasmarick said, but it was easier to install.    The problem, he said, was that the valve was also easy to install improperly. A mechanic &quot;may not snap it far enough,&quot; Mr. Kasmarick said. &quot;It feels like it's on, it looks like it's on, but it may not be totally connected.&quot; Ford said repairs will be made by adding &quot;retainer clips&quot; to reinforce the connection, adding that the procedure takes about 30 minutes.    The second recall action affects about 200,000 heavy-duty Econoline vans and certain campers and recreational vehicles built on Ford E-250 and E-350 van chassis.    Heat from the exhaust systems of these vehicles has in some cases boosted the temperature and pressure in the gas tanks, forcing fuel out of the tanks. Ford said it has reports of 83 fuel spills and eight fires stemming from this design problem. Eight people were injured in those fires, the company said.    The fuel spilling problem is similar to one that led Ford in June and July to recall 250 ambulances built on the E-350 chassis.    Charles White, Ford's chief of lighttruck chassis engineering, said yesterday that the troubles with the ambulances tipped off Ford to the broader problem with the larger vans. But, Mr. White said, the large vans experienced fuel spills in only six out of every 10,000 vehicles, whereas ambulances had them at a rate of 92 spills for every 10,000 ambulances.    To prevent fuel spills, Mr. White said Ford plans to install heat shields on the undercarriage of the vehicles to protect gas tanks from exhaust heat. The company said it also will install fuel vapor venting systems on vans equipped with 7.5-liter engines, and special vapor-venting gas-tank caps on lighter models equipped with 5.8-liter engines.    It isn't clear how yesterday's moves will hurt Ford's effort to bill itself as a leader in product quality. In recent years, the company has pushed hard for a quality image, with such advertising slogans as &quot;Quality is Job One,&quot; and &quot;The Best Built American Cars.&quot;    Yesterday's announcement also comes on the heels of Ford's April 30 recall of 1.1 million 1984 and 1985 model cars. That also was safety related, fixing a defect that could cause Ford's 1.6-liter or 2.3-liter four-cylinder engines to stall out, or prevent them from starting.    A company spokesman maintained, however, that the recalls shouldn't do long-term damage to the company's image. &quot;We've got research showing that when you do a safety recall the cars being recalled are perceived as safer,&quot; the spokesman said. &quot;People tend to appreciate the fact that you found a problem and went out and fixed it.&quot;    Yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Ford closed at $103.125, up 62.5 cents.    The 4.1 million-vehicle recall announced yesterday is Ford's second largest for safety-related reasons, and its third largest ever. The largest, according to the company, was in 1977 when 4.9 million vehicles were called back to repair defects in the exhaust system that weren't safety related. In a 1972 safety-related action, Ford recalled 4.4 million vehicles to repair defective seat belts. Of that 1972 recall, four million of the vehicles were in the U.S. Of yesterday's fuel-line recall, 3.8 million of the vehicles are in the U.S.    The National Highway Transportation Safety Administration said it began an investigation into the fuel line defect on May 7, and notified Ford in July. Ford said that it made both of yesterday's recalls voluntarily.    ---           Top Ten Safety-Related Recalls in the U.S.              NUMBER OF COMPANY YEAR VEHICLES     MODEL YEARS     PROBLEMS  1 GM   1971 6.6 million  1965-70 cars    Faulty motor                           and trucks      mounts  2 GM   1981 5.8 million  1978-81 A-cars  Defective control                                           arm bolts  3 Ford 1972 4 million    1970-71 cars    Faulty seat belts  4 Ford 1978 3.8 million* 1986-88 cars    Defective fuel                           and trucks      lines  5 GM   1973 3.7 million  1971-72 cars    Potential steering                                           interference  6 Volkswagen         1972 3.7 million  1949-69 cars    Defective                                           windshield wipers  7 GM   1984 3.1 million  1979-80 cars    Faulty rear axles  8 GM   1969 2.9 million  1968-69 cars    Carbureter fires                           and trucks  9 GM   1969 2.5 million  1965-69 cars    Exhaust fumes in                                           car 10 GM   1977 2.2 million  1976 cars and   Loss of power                           trucks          brakes    *U.S.-sold vehicles affected by a recall announcedyesterday totaling 4.1 million cars and trucks world-wide.
