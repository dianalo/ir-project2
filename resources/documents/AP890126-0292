Professor Lance J. Hoffman of George Washington University saidthe virus which affected the Pentagon's ARPANET computer networklast November ``could have had very disastrous consequences for oursociety.''   ``It wasn't Chernobyl yet, it was the Three Mile Island _ it wokea lot of people up,'' Hoffman told a delegation of Japanese computerspecialists touring this country to assess the virus problem.   He was alluding to the catastrophic explosion and fire thatwracked a nuclear power plant in the Soviet Ukraine in April 1986,along with the much less severe partial meltdown which occurred atthe TMI atomic power station near Harrisburg, Pa., in March 1979.   Hoffman added: ``Unfortunately, I think the Chernobyl may wellhappen. We are not out of the woods.''   Viruses are generally small strings of computer codes that can bestealthily inserted into software programs, causing a variety ofproblems including destruction of computer data and sudden cloggingof a computer's memory with thousands of copies of the virus.   At the same George Washington University meeting, a staff memberfrom the Library of Congress disclosed that a virus had been foundlast fall within the massive institution's main catalog computersystem.   ``It didn't cause any damage. It was identified before it couldspread or permanently erase any data,'' said Glenn McLoughlin, acomputer science specialist with the Science Policy ResearchDivision of the library's Congressional Research Service.   He said the virus was found after personnel logging ontocomputers at the library noticed they had substantially lesscomputer memory space to work with than they had expected.   The virus apparently got into the Library of Congress system,McLoughlin said, through a piece of software obtained from theUniversity of Maryland.   ``We don't know whether it was a student at Maryland, or whetherMaryland had gotten it from somebody else. That was simply thelatest point of departure for the software,'' he said.   The six-man Japanese delegation attending Thursday's briefing waswinding up a 10-day tour of the United States. Their itinerary alsoincluded visits to the San Francisco area, Los Angeles, New YorkCity, International Business Machines Corp. offices in Purchase,N.Y., and Lehigh University, Bethlehem, Pa.   The group's head, Tomihisa Naito, president of S.G. EngineeringCompany Ltd., a Tokyo-based firm dealing with factory automation,commented that many people in both the United States and Japan still``do not recognize the importance of protecting computer systems.''   ``Information in computers has a lot of power nowadays, so peopleshould be aware of the possibility that that information can becontaminated,'' he said.   Edwin B. Heinlein, a computer security consultant from SanRafael, Calif., who helped arrange the Japanese visit, said heagreed with Hoffman's assessment that the chances are ``very good''for a disastrous computer virus incident.   ``You can make all the laws you want, but only ethical behaviorwill keep people from doing bad things,'' Heinlein said. Despitesafeguards now being introduced in many computer systems, he said,``there's always going to be a loophole, or somebody being able totake advantage of things.''</TEXT></DOC>
