(Rumors)(Column)andM;</TITLE><DESCRIPT/><TEXT>A Cheshire grin spread slowly across the Katt's bestubbled puss as the firstflakes of winter melted into a heavy slush.andP;  At last! the perfect revenge forCal's unexpected arrival on his doorstep this summer: endless shoveling attheir Northeast retreat.andM;Being careful not to wake the lad before the white stuff had accumulatednicely, Spencer lit a fire, curled into a high-back leather wing chair andturned on his Sharp Wizard to begin his holiday gift list.andM;Five years from now, the hottest product on that list may be the multimedianotebook PC that Apple, Sony and Motorola are developing, the Puss pondered.andO;Tabby tattlers in Japan sent him word last week that the palm-sized devicewill use radio waves to transmit sound, images and text.andM;The toy-sized tablet will be a true collaboration, the correspondents said,noting that Sony and Motorola have invested in General Magic, an Applesubsidiary.andP;  General Magic will make the multimedia notebook, with Sonysupplying audiovisual equipment and Motorola providing communicationstechnology.andP;  The trio is also considering bringing Toshiba, Matsushita andATandamp;T into the project.andM;The notebook sure is interesting, Spencer purred; unfortunately, it won't beready for this year's Generous Gift Array (GGA).andP;  Alas, even the new printersfrom Lexmark won't be announced until January, the magnanimous muckrakermused.andP;  For a moment, Spencer considered doling out IOUs to tattlers in needof a 17-ppm laser, which Lexmark plans to have in its printer cavalcade.andM;But if he was going to do that, the wise one reckoned, he might as well waitto evaluate the two laser lines coming from Genicom next year.andP;  The24-year-old maker of impact printers will finalize its purchase of controllermaker Rastek this month.andP;  With Lexmark in Kentucky and Genicom in Virginia,the Katt looks forward to a neighborly contest of laser legions.andM;Deciding, finally, that laser printers might be a tad lavish, the frugalfeline searched instead for a useful, inexpensive gift.andP;  With a barelysuppressed &quot;Aha!&quot; the nattering nabob sprang to check his calendar for thedelivery date of Tool Technology Publishing's Win Tools.andP;  Beta testers of theproduct say it will compete handsomely against Norton Desktop for Windows.andM;Spencer wasn't absolutely certain how much Win Tools will cost, but hefigured $149 isn't too much to spend on furry friends in a frenzy overWindows' unstable code.andP;  Look for Win Tools by the end of the month.andM;While he was at it, Spencer made a note to send some homemade IBM Curtainsfor Windows to Redmond, just for fun.andP;  Better yet, he'd ship one of thegrass-roots T-shirts making the rounds these days.andP;  This takeoff on a popularad was sent to Rumor Central last week by an OS/2 promoter:andM;This is your brain: IBM OS/2 PM.andP;  This is your brain on drugs: MicrosoftWindows.andM;For the few on his list who still insist that Unix is the OS of the future,the Katt keyed in a brazenly extravagant gift: a new SPARC clone fromHyundai.andP;  The Korean manufacturer next year will make the leap from a SPARCchip house to a system supplier, his nibs has learned.andM;Toshiba, meanwhile, is in dire need of an elf this season to deliver someinternal modems for its T2200SX notebook.andP;  The company is fretting over abatch of 1,000 modems -- delivered last week -- that are too thick for theirslots.andP;  Toshiba has asked the U.S.andP;  modem maker to remold the critters andsend 'em back by mid-January.andM;Novell would probably enjoy a bootleg copy of &quot;LAN Man, the Movie,&quot; Spencerthought.andP;  The LAN Man engineer who wrote the hilarious film sent word thathe's working on release 2.0: &quot;LAN Man, the SQL.&quot;andM;The krafty Katt decided to send Philippe Kahn some coal for his shamefulravaging of rival Lotus' departed staff.andP;  The Borland heavy, who recentlylured aboard Kelsey Selander, Lotus' ex-veep of marketing, is now wooingManzi's old sidekick Heidi Sinclair.andP;  A deal is on the table, but Sinclair --Lotus' former vice president of corporate communications -- has yet to signon the dotted line.andM;Spencer, pleased by his progress on the GGA, put the Wizard away and dreamtof a White Christmas.andP;  Gazing cunningly at the precipitous pile outside, hegrabbed a shovel from the hall closet and yelled from the bottom of thestairs.andM;&quot;Oh, Cal!&quot; he called.andP;  &quot;I've got an early present for you down here.&quot;andM;.....  .FIB</TEXT></DOC>
