(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>PC laser printers suit this era of disposable products.andP;  No muss, no fuss;throwaway cartridges eliminate handling the toner powder that puts black onyour paper and nearly everything else it touches.andP;  Handy as toner cartridgesare, no one likes to change them, or worse, pay for them.andM;Even at mail-order prices, a toner cartridge for a Hewlett-Packard LaserJetII or III costs around $80.andP;  On top of that, you're sending another fourpounds of plastic and metal to the landfill every time you buy a newcartridge.andP;  The fact is, you'll eventually spend more money on lasercartridges than you did on the printer itself.andM;A growing number of companies have sprung up offering to cut your cartridgecosts and, at the same time, assuage any feelings of environmental guilt youmay have.andP;  Though the toner may be gone, the rest of the cartridge will go onworking just fine through several more loads of toner.andM;These recharge firms take your toner empties, remanufacture them, and sendthem back to you at half the cost of a new cartridge.andP;  Many are local; somealso deal through the mail.andP;  (See the table.)andP;  Typically, a rebuilt, refilledHP LaserJet II cartridge will cost you from $40 to $50, return shippingincluded.andP;  Some companies will return the same cartridge you sent in, andmany guarantee next-day turnaround, though usually not both.andM;Many recharge suppliers offer options you'll find attractive.andP;  Specialextra-black graphics toner that provides darker, more even fills for graphicsand desktop publishing costs $10 to $20 more.andP;  Sometimes called ultra-black,it also stretches farther for text.andP;  Colored toners, usually dark blue orbrown, usually run an additional $20 to $30.andP;  The same price goes formagnetic ink character recognition (MICR) toner used for printing checks.andP;  Ifyou have an HP LaserJet II, III, or other printer that uses a Canon SX laserengine, it's a good idea to invest $30 to $50 in a long-life replacement drumthat will work through another eight to twelve toner recharges.andP;  The originalphoto-conductive drum used in these type EP-S cartridges may not last throughmore than one or two recharges.andM;If you don't want to use recharged cartridges, you can still sell yourempties.andP;  The companies either rebuild and sell them, or use them or spareparts.andP;  Most of the remanufacturers will buy empties at $5 to $7 apiece ifyou ship them in the original shipping materials and include the felt-coveredfusing wand for the Canon EP and EP-S cartridges.andM;Canon toner cartridges dominate the recharge market.andP;  Unlike most other lasercartridges, they contain the expensive optical or organic photoconductor(OPC) drum responsible for receiving the image, attracting the toner, andtransferring that toner to the page.andM;This combination of high cost and popularity makes the Canon cartridges goodcandidates for a rebuild.andP;  They're found in the Hewlett-Packard LaserJet,Apple, Canon PC copiers, and many other brands of laser printers.andP;  (See thetable of common cartridge types.)andP;  IBM 4019 cartridges also contain the OPCdrum, and cost even more than Canon cartridges, so some businesses arestarting to handle them as well.andM;Other cartridges sometimes handled by recharge places are those used in SharpZ series copiers.andP;  These cartridges are also used in Xerox 5008 copiers,Fujitsu 7100 series machines, and some Ricoh printers.andM;If you've heard bad stories about toner refillers, it's time to take a secondlook.andP;  The business has matured since the days of drilling holes in usedcartridges and just refilling them.andP;  Today's toner rechargers disassemble,clean, and inspect the cartridge, replacing any worn parts.andP;  Only then dothey add new toner, and usually more than the original equipment manufacturer(OEM) supplied in the first place.andM;You may have also heard, perhaps from a laser printer salesperson, that usingremanufactured toner cartridges voids your printer's warranty.andP;  This simplyisn't true.andP;  Both Hewlett-Packard and, belatedly, Canon have made officialpronouncements debunking this policy.andP;  Legally, companies have to honor theirwarranties; they can't force you to buy their cartridges.andP;  If the dealer ormail-order house from which you bought your printer gives you trouble becauseyou use recycled cartridges, call the manufacturer.andM;What is true is that your printer's warranty won't pay for any damage causedby a rebuilt cartridge that jams or leaks toner.andP;  To cover this unlikelysituation, almost all cartridge remanufacturers provide a written warrantythat covers any damage to your printer caused by their product.andP;  None of therecharge businesses to which I have talked have yet been asked to honor thiswarranty.andM;If you do have problems with a recharged cartridge, it's more likely to bepoor printing quality resulting from a poor manufacturing job rather thantrouble with the printer itself.andM;Toner cartridge remanufacturing is a painstaking process that demandsattention to detail.andP;  Among the many good firms out there are some companieswith which you probably don't want to do business.andP;  That's why most tonerrecharge places offer a money-back 100-percent guarantee of satisfaction fora period of 30 days to one year.andP;  Go with a company that guarantees qualityand warrants against printer damage.andP;  If you don't like the print quality youget, try another firm.andP;  Chances are good that you will be satisfied.andM;Whether these businesses advertise refilling, recharging, rebuilding,reconditioning, or remanufacturing, to evaluate one of them over the phone,it helps to know how their process should go.andP;  Their first step should alwaysbe to pretest the cartridge by printing a few test pages.andP;  This is the bestway to detect damage to the delicate OPC drum, the part that wears out first.andO;Both abrasion and exposure to light can damage the drum.andP;  Surface nicks showas black dots on the page, and overexposure to light makes for grayed-outprinting.andM;Streaks probably come from a dirty corona wire, an element that helps erasethe image from the drum after printing.andP;  Shipping usually knocks loose enoughtoner for the remanufacturer to test printing, and if the cartridge isbone-dry, the rebuilder can always add enough toner for testing.andM;The Canon EP cartridge used in Canon's PC copiers and HP's first LaserJetprinters may last through seven to ten recharge cycles.andP;  However, the EP-Scartridge used in HP's LaserJet II and III series printers may last throughonly one to three recharges, if that.andP;  Some rechargers suspect Canon ofcheapening the drum coating to discourage remanufacturing.andP;  If pretesting orvisual inspection show a drum needs replacing, the company will call to letyou know what your options are.andP;  Some will also send you print samples todemonstrate the problem.andM;Drum replacement possibilities include sending you a cartridge alreadyremanufactured and ready to go, and replacing your drum with a good one froma used cartridge.andP;  Not all recharge places offer this last option and maycharge another $10 to $15 for this replacement.andP;  If you have an EP-Scartridge, however, your best bet is to pay $30 to $50 extra for a newlong-life OPC drum generally rated to last for 30,000 prints or around 10recharge cycles.andP;  A toner charge generally goes for 2,000 to 4,000 prints,depending on what kind of printing you do.andP;  Long-life replacement drums forthe LX laser engine used in HP's LaserJet IIP are just starting to appear onthe market.andM;Pretesting requires that a business buy laser printers for all or mostcartridges that it remanufactures.andP;  It's true that a recharger can evaluatethe condition of your OPC drum from printed samples you send in with thedrum, and from a visual examination of the drum surface.andP;  Relying on yoursamples, however, won't show any drum damage that could happen duringshipping.andP;  Visual examination of a drum is difficult enough that a flaw couldget through.andP;  Having equipment is also important for testing toners, whichare specific to each cartridge type.andP;  Toner is complex material, and eachbatch a recharger buys is slightly different from the last.andM;After pretesting, the recharger disassembles the cartridge and cleanseverything of toner--plastic gears, shutters, rubber scrapers, and especiallythe corona wire.andP;  Inspection determines if any parts should be replaced.andO;Other than the drum, the part most likely to wear out is the rubber scrapingblade that cleans excess toner from the drum after the toner transfers topaper.andP;  Replacement comes from either used or new parts, depending on thebusiness.andP;  The cartridge is then reassembled, and some parts, such as themagnetic roller that pulls toner from the storage chamber, are checked forproper tolerances.andM;Some cartridge rebuilders advertise a coating or treatment that makes yourexisting drum last longer.andP;  There are lots of coatings on the market, andmany don't work well.andP;  If one does work well for businesses, they won't tellyou what it is.andP;  You might ask the nature of the treatment.andP;  All drums shouldbe treated with drum-packing powder before shipping to lubricate the drumuntil the toner takes over that job.andM;Canon EP and EP-S cartridges have a fusing or fixing wand that lubricates andcleans the upper fuser roller.andP;  The two fuser rollers together supply thepressure and heat that fuses the toner to the paper.andP;  All recharge businessesask that you return this wand with the cartridge so they can replace its feltpad.andP;  If you don't, they'll supply a new wand at a few dollars extra cost.andO;HP LaserJet IIP cartridges don't have the wand.andM;The recharger fills the cleaned and reassembled cartridge with new toner andapplies a seal to keep the toner in the storage area during shipping.andP;  Theseal is critical to printing quality.andP;  It keeps toner from getting into theprinting area where it can leak out of the cartridge or dirty the coronawire, which causes streaky printing.andP;  This is why you must handle a cartridgecarefully and keep it right-side-up once you've removed the seal, and whyit's important that the remanufacturer disassemble and thoroughly clean theinside of the cartridge of old toner after receiving it from you.andM;There's some debate over the best type of seal.andP;  Some use a rigid plastic damthat others claim is hard to apply or leaks slightly.andP;  More recent ispressure-sensitive Tyvek tape that seals well, but can be hard to pull out.andO;Some cartridge refillers call the latter an OEM seal, but the real McCoycomes with a flexible seal applied with heat.andP;  Heat seals are just becomingavailable to toner rechargers.andM;The 100 percent satisfaction guarantee is the best judge here.andP;  The best sealis the one that works best and keeps returns to a minimum.andP;  After sealing,most cartridge rebuilders check their work by placing a small amount of toneralong the magnetic roller, and printing enough copies to clean it out.andM;An indication of careful remanufacturing is a company that serializes eachcartridge and keeps individual service histories as a cartridge goes throughmultiple recharges.andP;  A recharger can use that data to track problems and testimprovements in the process.andP;  Many toner refillers make a big deal ofreturning your own cartridge to you every time.andP;  With a good guarantee, thisis probably an unnecessary, though reassuring step.andM;If you're going to recycle your toner cartridges, there are several steps youcan take to make the process more successful.andP;  Always save the originalpacking material, especially the foam end caps and the lightproof bag.andP;  WithCanon cartridges, the end caps are important to keep the outer cartridge frombeing pressed against the OPC drum, which is quite close to the thin,flexible wall on the bottom of the cartridge.andP;  Because of the proximity ofthe drum to the bottom of the cartridge, it's easy to cause damage by leavingthe cartridge protruding over the edge of a table, for example.andM;The OPC drum is also very sensitive to light.andP;  Leaving the cartridge indirect sun for several minutes or under room light for half a day is enoughto overexpose the drum and make it worthless.andP;  Always store toner cartridgesin the lightproof bag.andM;If protected from physical abuse and light exposure, the OPC drum's sensitivecoating wears out from abrasion by the rubber scraper blade.andP;  Toner, thoughit contains fine abrasives to polish the drum, also lubricates the drum fromthe scraper blade.andP;  Running the printer without toner wears out a drum fast.andO;If you want the drum to last longer, there are two situations you shouldavoid.andP;  The first is leaving a printer on overnight or, worse, over theweekend.andP;  Many printers using the Canon laser engines dry cycle, which refersto the process of rotating the printing mechanism periodically to keep softrollers from developing flat spots.andP;  Dry cycling all weekend withoutlubricating toner wears on the drum.andP;  This is also true of printing to thelast drop of toner.andP;  The second tip is to send a cartridge in for rechargewhen the printer's toner light comes on, not when toner is completelyexhausted.andP;  Tip the cartridge from side to side, however, to make sure it'sreally empty.andM;In addition to inquiring about the complete remanufacturing process, askabout shipping details.andP;  Is return shipping included with the price?andO;LaserQuipt ships two-day air.andP;  Ask about the details of the return process ifyou have problems with a recharged cartridge.andP;  Black Lightning, for example,issues a UPS call tag and pays for shipping back the cartridge.andP;  You mightask for print samples, keeping in mind that you'll get hand-picked sheets.andO;This is particularly important if you're looking for a color toner.andP;  But mostof all, check the details of the warranty.andP;  You'll want satisfaction or yourmoney back.andP;  If one company doesn't satisfy you, try another.andM;SecondandM;Times AroundandM;There are several advantages to sending in your laser toner cartridges forremanufacturing:andM;* Save money by recycling expensive cartridges.andM;* For $40 to $50, half the mail-order price of a new cartridge, laserrecharge firms dismantle, clean, inspect, and refill your used cartridges.andM;* Most recharge businesses provide a 100 percent, money-back guarantee ofsatisfaction, and a written warranty covering the unlikely event that arefill damages your printer.andM;* You can make the recycling process work better by taking care of your tonercartridges.andP;  Save the original packing materials.andP;  Don't print a cartridgecompletely dry, and store it in its lightproof shipping bag.andM;LASER CARTRIDGE REMANUFACTURERSandM;Following is a sampler of businesses that remanufacture laser cartridgesthrough the mail.andP;
