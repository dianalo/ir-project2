But traders said they were generally surprised at how wellthe dollar held up in spite of the rate cut -- which came aday after Germany raised its key interest rates. Lower U.S.interest rates and higher rates abroad decrease theattractiveness of dollar-denominated investments.</LP><TEXT>   Stopping just short of retesting its historical low of1.4625 marks, the dollar was quoted late Friday in New Yorkat 1.4680 marks, down from 1.4770 marks late Thursday; itactually gained slightly against the Japanese currency, to131.50 yen from 131.27 yen. The pound rose to $1.9755 from$1.9660. The Swiss franc and Canadian dollar also scoredgains against the U.S. currency.   At midmorning in Tokyo Monday, the dollar was trading at131.25 yen, unchanged from Friday's Tokyo close. Meanwhile,the U.S. currency was trading at 1.4685 marks, down from1.4801 marks at Friday's close.   The dollar has been hit &quot;with so many lefts and rights andit still won't die,&quot; said Lenny Dendunnen, assistant vicepresident at Union Bank of Switzerland in New York.   Before the Fed's move, a survey of eight economists andforeign exchange analysts around the globe predicted that thedollar will remain weak this month. The survey is conductedmonthly by Dow Jones International News Service.   The two major factors in the market -- the war in thePersian Gulf and the U.S.'s economic fundamentals -- willtend to offset each other and blunt the dollar's movements,the analysts say. War news might send investors scurrying tothe dollar, which long has been a haven in times ofinternational tension, but the weak U.S. economy and fallinginterest rates will work the other way. Because they expectnarrow trading ranges, analysts say, dealers won't speculate,and activity will be thin.   Easier credit is also expected in Japan as that country'seconomy slows, but U.S. rates are expected to go down first.Traders also will continue to watch U.S. economic data to tryto gauge the recession's depth.   The average of the eight estimates in the survey is thatthe dollar will trade at 1.4791 marks and 130.50 yen at theend of February. The forecasters also see the U.S. currencyat 1.4675 marks and 131 yen at the end of April.   &quot;I think the war and economic data are going to conflictwith each other. We are going to trade in a range,&quot; saysMichael Rosenberg, an international foreign exchangeeconomist at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Group in New York.   Tony Cox, chief interbank dealer at BankAmerica inFrankfurt, agrees: &quot;We could well be in for a period of flatforeign exchange markets,&quot; he says.   Akira Suzuki, senior manager of foreign exchange withMitsubishi Trust andamp; Banking in Tokyo, says the market will beboxed in by traders too skittish to take positions.   At the extremes, two analysts said the dollar will tradeat 1.45 marks and three said it will stand at 1.50 marks atthe end of February. Their end-of-month range against theJapanese currency is 124 to 136 yen.   A survey published at the beginning of this year put thedollar at 1.5010 marks and 134.25 yen by the end of January.And a survey at the beginning of December predicted thedollar would trade at 1.4835 marks and 128.76 yen at the endof February.   The major pressure on the dollar is an expectation offurther U.S. rate-easing. Federal Reserve Board Chairman AlanGreenspan has sent mixed signals on rates. But he isevidently looking at the growth of the U.S. money supply togauge the depth of the nation's &quot;credit crunch.&quot;   If the money supply doesn't expand quickly enough, Mr.Greenspan has said, the Fed will be forced to ease. PresidentBush, in his State of the Union address last week, saidinterest rates should be lower &quot;now.&quot;   In some recent congressional testimony, the Fed chairmanhas appeared inclined to wait for one set of rate cuts tohave an effect on the economy before easing further. However,Charles Lieberman, an economist at Manufacturers HanoverTrust in New York, says he expects &quot;more easing of monetarypolicy&quot; by the U.S.'s central bank. Mr. Lieberman says hedoesn't see the recession bottoming out any time soon andpredicts it will take &quot;substantial new steps&quot; by the Fed toend the U.S.'s credit crunch.   Several economists expect the U.S. economy to begin toturn up, or at least bottom out, in the next few months. Buttheir estimates largely depend on the length of the PersianGulf war. Last week, Mr. Greenspan said the nation couldsuffer a long and deep recession if the war lasts longer thanabout mid-April.   Japan's cautious approach to an eventual rate cut,meanwhile, probably will work against the dollar, and aneasing in German rates is regarded as unlikely over the nextquarter.   Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno has been saying formonths that he wants to slow down Japan's overheated economy.Even so, Mr. Suzuki of Mitsubishi Trust says yen interestrates probably won't change, although short-term rates couldbegin edging lower by April amid a slowdown in the economy.   German rates, meanwhile, &quot;will stay firm until {GermanFinance Minister Theo} Waigel says what taxes will be raisedand what the effect will be,&quot; says Dieter Gloeckner, seniortrader at Deutsche Girozentrale-Deutsche Kommunalbank inFrankfurt. Economists are watching Mr. Waigel for clues towhat fiscal measures the German government will use to bridgeits budget gap.
