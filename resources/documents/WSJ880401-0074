OF AMERICA  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it raised its ratings on $1.2 billion of Alcoa's long-term debt. Senior debt and pollution control and industrial revenue bonds were raised to single-A-2 from single-A-3, convertible subordinated Eurodebentures to single-A-3 from Baa-1, and commercial paper to Prime-1 from Prime-2. The rating concern said the upgrades reflect the Pittsburgh-based aluminum maker's &quot;leadership position&quot; in the aluminum industry and its &quot;improving financial condition,&quot; largely a result of improved metals prices. Moody's also cited Alcoa's emphasis in the past few years on cost containment and modernization. A company spokesman couldn't be reached for comment.    ---   AMERICAN BRANDS Inc. -- Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. downgraded its ratings of $1.4 billion of securities of this Old Greenwich, Conn., marketer of tobacco products, distilled spirits and financial services. The rating of senior debt was lowered to single-A-minus from single-A-plus, subordinated debt and preferred stock to triple-B-plus from single-A, and commercial paper to single-A-2 from single-A-1. The rating concern cited the American Brands' recent $1.1 billion acquisition of E-II Holdings Inc., a Chicago-based holding company, and &quot;the apparent move to a less conservative financial policy.&quot; American Brands said it expects to &quot;continue to have full access to credit markets.&quot;    ---   CARE ENTERPRISES Inc. senior subordinated debt was downgraded to Ca from Caa by Moody's Investors Service Inc. About $67 million of the Laguna Hills, Calif.-based nursing-home chain's debt is affected. Moody's said its action reflects Care's decision to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection, under which a company is shielded from creditor lawsuits as it devises a debt-payment plan. A Care spokesman said the Moody's action &quot;was expected.&quot;    ---   PRIMERICA Corp. -- This Greenwich, Conn.-based financial services and retailing concern's debt ratings were lowered by Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. The rating concern downgraded Primerica's senior debt to triple-B-minus from triple-B; its subordinated debt to double-B-plus from triple-B-minus; its preferred to double-B from double-B-plus; and its commercial paper to single-A-3 from single-A-2. The moves affect about $740 million of debt and $150 million of preferred. Sandamp;P cited Primerica's pursuit of acquisitions and divestitures and the resulting increase in financial leverage. Primerica's debt as a percentage of capital grew to 57.9% at the end of 1987 from 30.9% in 1986, but a company spokesman said the ratio is being reduced. Primerica also said its fundamentals are sound and that it plans to continue to divest itself of &quot;non-strategic assets&quot; to enhance its financial position and growth prospects. </TEXT></DOC>
