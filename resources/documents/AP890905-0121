(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Evangelist Jim Bakker, facing a hearing onwhether his fraud and conspiracy trial will continue, sufferedstress and not mental illness when he collapsed, his wife saidTuesday.   Also Tuesday, Bakker's lawyers filed a motion seeking a mistrialon grounds that the collapse of a witness during defense crossexamination last week prejudiced the jury.   The U.S. Marshal's Office said a hearing would be held at 10:30a.m. on Wednesday to determine if Bakker is mentally competent tostand trial. Attorneys and others in the case are forbidden todiscuss it under a gag order.   Defense lawyer Harold Bender filed the mistrial motion justbefore the court closed Tuesday.   The motion said it was likely that jurors would blame defenseattorneys for Steve Nelson's collapse since he passed out duringcross examination by the defense.   Nelson, a former PTL official, testified he had warned Bakkerthat someone could go to prison because of financial practices atPTL. He collapsed during that testimony, and Bakker suffered hisemotional collapse the next day.   Tammy Faye Bakker said her husband ``was so out of it that hethought they were taking him to an animal hospital'' when he wassent to a prison hospital last week.   ``After 2{ years of sheer mental torture, he was just stressedout,'' Mrs. Bakker said in a taped statement broadcast Tuesday onthe Jim and Tammy Show.   Bakker resigned from the PTL ministry in March 1987 in a sex andmoney scandal. His trial started Aug. 28 in U.S. District Court oncharges that he used nearly $4 million in ministry funds to supporta lavish lifestyle. The trial was recessed Thursday when Bakkerdidn't come to court and his psychiatrist said it was because he washallucinating.   When Bakker was taken to the prison hospital at the FederalCorrectional Institution at Butner, north of Durham, Bakkerapparently confused it with an animal hospital in Charlotte namedButler Animal Hospital.   Mrs. Bakker also said her husband's civil rights were violatedwhen U.S. District Court Judge Robert Potter ordered Bakker to thefederal prison hospital.   ``Jim's constitutional rights have been violated. ... He has beentreated like a carnival show,'' she said.   The judge ``flew into a rage'' when he was told Thursday thatBakker couldn't come to court, Mrs. Bakker said in the broadcast,and ``ordered federal marshals to seize him.''   ``These big men took one small man ... and put him in shackles... and paraded him across the yard in shackles, sobbing and cryingwith his hair all messed up,'' she said.   ``Nobody called us. No one told Jim where he was going. I calledthe lawyers and they didn't even know where he was. I went for anentire day and didn't even know if Jim was dead or alive.   Bakker is charged with 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy andfaces 120 years in prison and more than $5 million in fines.   Bryan Bledsoe, a spokesman at Butner, declined to comment Tuesdayon the progress of the evaluation. But he did confirm reports fromBakker's wife that her husband was handcuffed during her visits withhim and was strip searched afterward.</TEXT></DOC>
