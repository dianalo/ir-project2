Capital spending fell to $4.7 billion from $6.1 billion in 1985, and inventories tumbled to $9.01 billion from $10.33 billion. IBM said inventories would have been $600 million lower in 1986 if adjusted for the effects of currency translation.    Though clearly scaling back after making overly optimistic growth assumptions, IBM also pointed out that spending on research, development and engineering rose 11% to $5.2 billion.    IBM acknowledged that sales, general and administrative expenses surged 19% in 1986 to $15.5 billion. But it said the rise would have been just 8% if adjusted for the impact of currency translation and would have been even smaller if not for the redeployment of employees under a cost-cutting plan.    The annual report also said IBM took a write-off associated with the planned sale of its South African operations, but the amount wasn't disclosed. An IBM spokesman said it was &quot;not material.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
