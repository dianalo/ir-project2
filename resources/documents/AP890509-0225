But when Gall applied to adopt a handicapped child six yearsago, 20 U.S. adoption agencies turned her down _ simply because shewas single.   Tenacity, she soon discovered, is a requirement for anyonejoining the growing ranks of single women who want to adopt. Herpersistence paid off: She eventually adopted two children fromGuatemala.   ``I'm thrilled those 20 agencies said no to me, because I gotthe most wonderful kids,'' said Gall, 39, now assistant secretaryof human development services in the federal Department of Healthand Human Services. ``When you have beautiful children who love youdearly, it's like sitting in the sun all the time.''   While there were few single adoptive parents 10 years ago,experts estimate they comprise 10 percent of those adopting today.Local chapters of the national Committee for Single AdoptiveParents, based in Maryland, are proliferating.   Ninety percent of singles who adopt are women. Those familiarwith the type say it takes a special kind of woman to spendthousands of dollars in adoption fees, sacrifice her social lifeand put up with one rejection after another in the search for achild to call her own.   ``These are women who have a strong maternal instinct, who wantto be called mommy, for whom marriage is not immediately in thecards and they are facing the proverbial biological clock,'' saidJeffrey Rosenberg of the National Committee for Adoption.   ``Generally they're between 35 and 45, professional women whohave established themselves. They're pretty comfortable with whatthey want out of life, and are pretty stubborn to make this wholedecision,'' said Lea Wait, 45, of Bernardsville, N.J., an ATandamp;Tmanager who adopted four children and runs a support group forsingles who adopt.   Or, as Lindsay Gambini put it, ``I knew I wanted to be a mother.I wasn't sure I wanted to be a wife.''   Gambini, 39, manager of a Manhattan performing arts center,adopted two children, but not without a struggle. First an adoptionin the Philippines fell through. She turned to the New York Cityfoster-care system but was turned down because she planned to hirea babysitter during working hours. She was offered older children,but thanks to a shortage of foster homes for infants and her ownpersistence, she prevailed and got two baby boys, now 28 months and15 months old.   Both boys were abandoned by their birth mothers, victims ofgrinding poverty and the drug epidemic that has nearly doubled thecity's foster care load since 1986.   ``The elder one is a bit developmentally delayed and the youngerone had some drugs in his system,'' she said, adding a mother'sproud P.S.: ``They're cute as buttons.''   Like other single women who adopt boys, Gambini says malefriends and relatives are happy to fill in as role models.Otherwise, they improvise, as Mary Gall did when her son's soccerteam needed a coach: She bought a book about the game and committedit to memory.   Does adopting children dash all hopes of matrimony for thesingle woman? Joy Duva, 41, who works in Washington, D.C., for theChild Welfare League, echoed most single moms when she said that ifshe ever does find the right man, ``that person would love me andthe baby.''   Duva recently adopted a girl from Paraguay, forced, as was Gall,to adopt overseas because domestic agencies favor couples. Much ofthe difficulty single women face here stems from the fact that manyof them want healthy babies, and there's a lot of competition frominfertile couples. A lot of agencies, as Gall discovered, are evenreluctant to place older, special-needs children with singles.   ``Traditionally the thinking was that families with a husbandand a wife were the best place for a child to be, particularly forkids who never had that,'' said Phil Coltoff, who heads theChildren's Aid Society in New York City.   But, he noted, ``there's been a rethinking of what single womencan offer.'' An independent career woman is a powerful role modelfor any child, he said, adding that at least 10 percent of theChildren's Aid Society's foster mothers are single.   Some agencies say certain children with special needs areactually better off with single parents.   ``If a kid has been in a group home and has learned to notattach to people, it might be easier for him to bond with oneperson than two,'' said Bob Diamond, head of Aid to Adoption ofSpecial Kids in Oakland, Calif., which makes 15 percent to 20percent of its placements with single parents.   Betsy Burch, who runs a national information and referralorganization called SPACE, for Single Parents for the Adoption ofChildren Everywhere, from her home in Natick, Mass., says singleparents today can even adopt young, healthy American children, aslong as they are open to interracial adoption.   ``I was teaching in Boston,'' Burch recalled. ``I had mymaster's degree in urban education and found out there were manyblack kids who needed placement. I decided to go ahead and do it.''Burch, who is white, has adopted four black children.   Coltoff of the Children's Aid Society also stressed the need forflexibility in interracial adoptions.   ``At any one time we have close to 500 (kids in foster care). Ifwe have one or two white kids, it's accidental,'' he said. ``Mostof the children in agencies like ours are black and Hispanic orinterracial.''   Would legislation make it any easier for single adoptiveparents? Gall thinks not.   ``You can't change public opinions through law,'' she said. ``Ifyou want to reach people and say single parent homes are goodhomes, it's a matter of educating them to realize that familiesdon't all look alike.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, May 14</NOTE></DOC>
