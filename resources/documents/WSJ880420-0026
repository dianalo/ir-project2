But the complex transaction's closing was held up by some unexpected crises involving one of First City's failing banks, debt holders who continued to refuse to exchange their notes for cash, nervous investors who backed out at the last minute and assorted eleventh-hour glitches.    First City officials predicted that the rescue would be completed by late last night -- if all the negotiators at First City's Houston headquarters managed to sign several small mountains of documents.    In the end, Texas bank regulators were forced to close a First City bank in South Texas to ease concerns of some First City investors, and to preserve the basic structure of the bailout and keep the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.'s initial outlay from escalating. First City wouldn't comment, but it also apparently abandoned its goal of redeeming 70% of its $225.8 million in long-term debt. First City insiders say it settled for slightly more than 67% of the debt.    The original terms of the rescue, the second largest in banking history, were changed in one important way, according to FDIC officials. Instead of five years, the FDIC agreed to wait for as long as 10 years for the guaranteed repayment of $100 million of its assistance. The FDIC agreed to grant more time because of depressed real estate market conditions in Texas. The $100 million is the minumum payment due the FDIC from the proceeds of the sale of First City's bad loans and foreclosed real estate, which will be spun off into a separate unit. The FDIC payments would follow payments the spin-off bank would make to other First City bank units. If proceeds from liquidating the bad assets are insufficient to pay the FDIC, terms of the transaction call for First City's new holding company to make up the difference.    To hasten completion of the bailout, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. agreed to find additional investors when other investors backed out. New York-based Drexel tentatively agreed to raise $100 million of the $500 million in fresh capital that will be injected into a recapitalized First City.    Yesterday's biggest snag concerned McAllen State Bank, McAllen, Texas, a failing unit with $590.7 million in assets and a negative net worth of about $9 million. Regulators said the bank faced suits seeking more than $400 million, the result of a large number of actions brought by borrowers. William M. Issac, a former FDIC chairman and now a bank consultant, said some new investors in First City were unwilling to close the transaction unless the McAllen bank's legal liabilities were carved out.    To do that, Texas bank regulators closed the McAllen bank and named the FDIC as receiver. The agency sold almost all the bank's assets and deposits to First City's flagship Houston bank, which plans to reopen it. Any court awards against the McAllen bank would be paid out of the slim remains of the failed bank's assets in FDIC receivership, which regulators say are almost worthless.    The FDIC's action with the McAllen bank slightly improves the value of the First City bailout at little, if any, cost to the FDIC.    The rescue plan, which was announced publicly last September, calls for the FDIC to inject a restructured First City with a $970 million note and $500 million of new capital to be raised by an investor group led by Chicago banker A. Robert Abboud. The $500 million would be exchanged for new common and preferred shares. To lure much-needed investors, initial yields were raised on two classes of the preferred stock issue last weekend. The initial yields were increased to 13 1/2% from 13% for one class and to 11% from 10% on the other. </TEXT></DOC>
