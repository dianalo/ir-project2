The 77-year-old Roman Catholic nun, famous for her 1979 NobelPeace Prize and slight stature, made an unpublicized tour ofcentral London Tuesday with sisters of her Missionaries of Charity.   The Albanian-Indian nun's charity mission, founded in 1950,operates in 80 countries.   She described her reaction to visiting London's homelessWednesday at a five-day Global Forum of Spiritual and ParliamentaryLeaders on Human Survival at Oxford. The nun came to Britain tojoin the group, which is discussing how to tackle world problemslike nuclear arms, pollution and poverty.   She told reporters in London just before meeting Mrs. Thatcherthat she would ask the prime minister ``to give us a house for ourpeople,'' a hostel for the homeless.   Her organization already operates two small hostels in Londonbut wants to establish a larger one.   As she left the official residence nearly 40 minutes later,Mother Teresa said Mrs. Thatcher pledged her help and that theprime minister's response was ``wonderful. She wants to help us tohelp our people.''   The prime minister's office said the two women did not discussdetails of a hostel but that Mrs. Thatcher told Mother Teresa aboutthe work being done by British voluntary service organizations.   Mother Teresa said that during her London visit, ``I went withthe sisters to bring a little bit of hot soup and food to homelesspeople.''   ``They were inside that cardboard box made like a little coffin.I didn't know what to say. My eyes were full of tears.   ``There was this man, lying there, protecting himself from thecold, with no home and no hope. He looked up and said: `It's along, long time since I felt the warmth of a human hand.'''   Also at the Oxford forum, Mother Teresa disagreed sharply withadvocates of contraception, urging ``natural family planningmethods'' instead.   ``I never give a child for adoption to a family that usescontraceptives that kill the power of love,'' she said. ``How can amother love another's child if she has killed the child of herlove?''</TEXT></DOC>
