They're justlaying off of it,'' he said on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America.''   He also chided members of Congress for what he said was a lackof concern for the hostages.   ``We sent 300 letters to the congressmen and senators over thelast six months and, through that time, we've only received 13replies,'' he said. One of them, whom he did not identify, askedfor a campaign contribution, said Cicippio, of Norristown, Pa.   ``I live on hope,'' said Peggy Say, who joined Cicippio on theprogram. Her brother, Terry Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent of The Associated Press, was abducted March 16, 1985.He has been held longer than any of the nine Americans in captivity.   Mrs. Say said increased activity involving the search for Lt.Col. William Higgins, who was kidnapped three weeks ago, gives hersome hope. But she said the hostage families should not ``have towait for a time when we could attach ourselves to a larger issue.''   ``I think the (Reagan) administration is consistently sayingthis is too complicated and that quiet diplomacy is the answer.None of these things are acceptable any more,'' said Mrs. Say, ofBatavia, N.Y.   She noted that a ceremony will be held in Washington March 16 tomark the third anniversary of her brother's abduction. The event,sponsored by No Greater Love, a humanitarian organization, and theJournalists' Committee to Free Terry Anderson, is to be duplicatedin other areas across the country and is indicative of a growinggrass-roots movement to gain the hostages' freedom, she said.   ``It's a human rights violation and I think Americans areunwilling to be silent any more about it,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
