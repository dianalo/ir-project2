All but four of the 300 delegates to a special joint assemblyvoted Sunday to reject the offer of $500 million ($415 millionU.S.) in cash and the use of 72,000 square miles of land in theMackenzie River region.   Leaders of the Dene Indians and the northern Metis _ who arehalf-descended from French fur traders _ called for morenegotiations with Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, setting a two-yeardeadline for agreement.   About 1,000 Indians gathered for a week at Hay River Indianreservation for the heated debate over whether to accept atentative agreement reached in May after protracted negotiations.   Some bands wanted to sign the agreement because of the tolltaken by poverty, alcoholism and other chronic problems on Indiansettlements.   But other groups demanded a broader agreement includingprovisions for self-government and clear title to their ancestralland. In the end, there were only three dissenting votes and oneabstention.   Georges Erasmus, president of the Assembly of First Nationswhich represents all Canadian Indians, urged Dene leaders not to``nail themselves to the cross'' of the federal offer. Anyone tootired to continue fighting for their rights should step down, hesaid.   The assembly called for a meeting with Mulroney and IndianAffairs Minister Bill McKnight to renegotiate areas such asself-government, aboriginal title, taxation and water rights.   In a letter to the Dene and Metis last week, McKnight termed thedeal the government's last offer and demanded a decision by July15. He warned that Ottawa may not be willing to reopen negotiations.   The Snare Lakes Indian band leader, Alexis Arrowmaker, said heis willing to take that chance. ``We are powerful, we're strongenough to talk to any government.''   The Dene live below the timber line in a wintry region rich infish, game and mineral resources. Many follow a traditional way oflife by trapping for furs and hunting caribou.   The original Dene and Meti negotiators of the land claim saidownership of 72,000 square miles _ an area larger than North Dakota_ would have made their people the largest private landholders inNorth America.   The government would have retained oil and mineral rightsunderneath most of it, but the Indians were offered subsurfacerights for 3,200 square miles.   In addition, the government promised continued hunting, trappingand fishing rights on another 480,000 square miles of Crown land,stretching from the borders of Alberta and Saskatchewan to abovethe Arctic Circle.</TEXT></DOC>
