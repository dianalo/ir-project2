The single-particlelevel density parameter a is extracted as a function of temperature forvarious isospins of the system. At large temperatures, the empiricalvalue of a{approx_equal}A/8 is reproduced. A new method of extractingthe neutron-proton asymmetry parameter is proposed. The neutron-protonasymmetry parameter is found to depend very strongly on deformation andisospin at low temperatures. The effect of the shell structure on theasymmetry energy is predominant for certain isospins corresponding tostable neutron-proton combinations. Results are presented for A = 42,44, 46, and 208. The excitation energy versus isospin plot for constantentropy of the system exhibits pockets similar to yrast traps in high-spinstates of highly excited nuclei.</TEXT></DOC>
