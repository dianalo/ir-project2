Over the years, environmental groups have attacked bothinternational lending organizations for ignoring the environmentalthreats posed by the loans they made to the Third World for suchprojects as hydroelectric dams, roads and other developmentprojects.   Last year's annual meeting in West Berlin was disrupted on theopening day by thousands of environmental protestors.   Conable told the delegates from 152 nations that his agency isstriving to improve in this area by building environmental impactassessments into its loan review process and by boosting itsmonetary support to address such key environmental threats asdepletion of tropical rain forests, ocean pollution and globalwarming from the excessive use of fossil fuels.   In addition to global pollution, the finance officials werereviewing such issues as the Third World debt crisis, the politicalupheaval in Eastern Europe and the efforts needed to keep hugetrade imbalances from derailing the global economic expansion.   The U.S. delegation, led by Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady,continued to push forward with its debt-reductioninitiative, whichseeks to trim poor countries' debt burden by using IMF and WorldBank resources to spur debt forgiveness on the part of commercialbanks.   President Bush met with 65 leading bankers and otherinternational leaders at the White House to solicit support for theBrady plan.   The administration got good news Tuesday, when Venezuelanplanning minister Miguel Rodriguez Fandeo indicated that hiscountry was backing away from its demand that commercial banksprovide the nation with a 50 percent debt reduction, a demand thebanks had dismissed as completely unreasonable.   While the negotiations are continuing, Rodriguez said a group of15 banks has indicated it would provide Venezuela with a short-termloan of $600 million to allow the country to catch up on lateinterest payments.   The remarkable political changes under way in Eastern Europewere also under review at the annual meetings. Polish FinanceMinister Leszek Balcerowicz held discussions this week with Bradyto outline the proposals his new government, the first in EasternEurope to be led by non-Communists, was considering adopting torestructure the country's crippled economy.   President Bush's speech to the finance ministers Wednesday willtouch on the need for the West to provide financial support for thehistoric reforms underway in the Communist bloc, according topresidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.   Other countries have also made international aid to Poland andHungary top priorities with many officials saying the IMF and theWorld Bank need to focus expanded resources during the next decadetoward the goal of integrating the Communist world into the globaleconomy.   In his opening speech, IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessuscalled this development ``complex and historically unprecedented''and said many of the Communist nations needed to better address thehigh rates of inflation plaguing their nations.   Fitzwater said that the administration was ``sympathetic to theneed for more funds'' being sought by the World Bank and the IMF tomeet its growing responsibilities but that ``we haven't madejudgments yet about the amounts of aid.''   Finance officials from the world's seven richest countriescontinued their efforts Tuesday to push the dollar lower on foreigncurrency markets as a way of addressing America's huge tradedeficit.   Currency traders reported that major central banks intervenednumerous times during the day to sell dollars as the bankscontinued to back up a joint statement by the Group of Sevennations on Saturday that a further rise in the dollar's valuerepresented a threat to the world economy.   The efforts managed to drive the dollar lower in trading inTokyo and London but the dollar rose slightly against the yen inNew York, to 142.35, still down significantly from the 146-yenlevel of just last Friday.   Referring to the environment, French Finance Minister PierreBeregovoy said he believed the rich nations should voluntarilyprovide more money to the World Bank for environmental problems. Hesaid France was prepared to contribute $140 million toward a goalof creating an environmental fund of $1.25 billion.   Brady, in his speech at the opening session, called it essentialfor the World Bank to be guided by the principle that ``developmentand environmental protection must go hand in hand.'' But Bradyoffered no proposal to boost World Bank resources for this purpose.   The world's richest countries also addressed environmentalproblems at this year's economic summit in Paris. In his remarks,Japanese Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said his country wasmoving forward with commitments made in Paris to provide $2.1billion over three years to support conservation efforts in theThird World.   In addition to the environment, Conable said the Third Worldmust trim the $200 billion it spends annually on defense if itexpects to end its prolonged debt problems.   Conable said developing countries are devoting 20 percent oftheir government spending to defense and in the mid-1980s militarycosts exceeded the amounts Third World nations were devoting tohealth and education combined.   ``Let us hope that, in the changing political climate of the1990s, resources are increasingly allocated to more productivepurposes, in industrial countries as well as developingcountries,'' Conable said.</TEXT></DOC>
