A person wouldn't have to be convicted of a crime to be denied participation in federal housing-voucher or certificate programs, a department spokesman explained. Substantial evidence indicating the use or sale of drugs or participation in violent criminal activity would be enough to allow local public housing officials to deny service under the proposed rules, he said.    Current regulations permit the denial of the rental assistance programs only when the tenant allows the housing unit to be used for drug dealing.    &quot;I am determined that federal taxpayers will not be required to subsidize the rent of drug dealers and users or violent criminals,&quot; Mr. Kemp said in a statement. &quot;The only housing subsidies for felons should be provided by local jails, and state and federal prisons.&quot;    The regulations would allow family members of someone involved in felonious conduct to continue receiving assistance if that person didn't reside in the housing unit. In deciding cases, local public housing authorities could consider how denial or termination of a subsidy would affect family members not involved in the illegal activity, according to a HUD statement. </TEXT></DOC>
