Pascal Zachary   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>07/23/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A5A</SO><CO>   SIGM</CO><IN>COMPUTERS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (CPR)</IN><LP>   A major supplier of computer monitors plans next year tobegin selling models that give off sharply reduced amounts ofextremely low frequency, or ELF, electromagnetic emissions.These emissions, which are produced by standard computermonitors and many other electrical devices, are consideredhazardous by some medical researchers.   Sigma Designs Inc., which makes large-screen monitorsgenerally bought as an upgrade to standard computerequipment, is the first supplier to pledge to build low-ELFproducts. Other companies, notably International BusinessMachines Corp. and Digital Equipment Corp., announced planslast year to reduce the amount of very low frequency, or VLF,emissions, but none has disclosed plans to reduce ELFemissions.</LP><TEXT>   The Fremont, Calif., company said it is responding topressure from some consumers and health researchers, whocontend that extended exposure to ELF emissions can causecancer and other illnesses. Sigma is scheduled to formallyannounce its plans today.   &quot;This is a sign that the computer industry is finallytaking this {ELF} risk very seriously,&quot; said Louis Slesin,editor of VDT News, a bimonthly publication that reports onhealth and occupational concerns involving computer monitors.   While Sigma hopes to capitalize on growing demand formonitors that emit lower ELF levels, it doesn't plan todescribe the new monitors as safer in its promotional andadvertising materials.   &quot;We think the data is absolutely indeterminate whetherthere is a safety issue or not,&quot; said Charlie Waters, Sigma'svice president of marketing, &quot;so we don't want to add to thealarm about emissions.&quot;   Nevertheless, Mr. Waters said Sigma is convinced that amarket exists in the U.S. for low-ELF monitors, and heexpects other companies to enter it. &quot;The attention beinggiven this issue is creating concern,&quot; he said. &quot;We believethat's going to generate demand.&quot;   Already, some makers of personal computers, which shipmost of the monitors sold in the U.S., are coming under firefor failing to reduce electromagnetic emissions from theirproducts. In June, for instance, MacWorld, a monthly magazinedevoted to the Macintosh computer brand, began a campaign topressure the manufacturer, Apple Computer Inc., into takingaction. So far, Apple has agreed to fund health research onthe question, but it insists that the monitors it ships withits computers are safe.   Sigma's new monitors, which will work with the mostpopular brands of personal computers, will give off onlyabout one-tenth of the ELF emissions produced by thecompany's current monitors. The new monitors, which will comein monochrome but not in color, are outfitted with specialcircuitry that reduces both ELF and VLF emissions. They willbe priced at $200 more than Sigma's standard monitors, whichrange in price from $1,299 to $3,495. The company will beginselling the low-ELF models in the first quarter of next year.</TEXT></DOC>
