That was last year.    The takeover track has been muddied, at least temporarily, by uncertainty over the widening insider-trading scandal.    &quot;Merger mania produced unsustainable gains in general, both for the (stock market) averages and for the funds,&quot; says Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical Services Inc. The stock market was strong again last week before finishing mixed Friday, and many equity funds continue to ride the wave. Still, a shortage of mergers could begin to cut into some performance differentials among funds, says Mr. Lipper, although he doesn't see any signs yet.    Although he and others say it's nearly impossible to generalize about how much of a boost mutual funds got from their holdings of takeover stocks, the effect is easier to see by looking at a few specialized funds and at funds that abstained from trading in takeover issues.    Michael Price, president of Mutual Shares Corp., notes that the recent Wall Street insider-trading arrests didn't shock stock prices the way that news of the $100 million settlement in the Ivan Boesky insider case did last November.    &quot;Now there's almost a cushion in the market about what will happen next,&quot; Mr. Price says. The fund that he heads invests largely in stocks of companies that are in extraordinary circumstances such as bankruptcy proceedings, takeovers or restructurings.    &quot;Boesky cost us 1%&quot; in 1986, Mr. Price says. The Mutual Shares fund finished the year with a gain of 16.98%. About a dozen takeover stocks tumbled late last year as Mr. Boesky liquidated a huge risk-arbitrage portfolio as part of the settlement of insider-trading charges.    Currently, about 20% of Mutual Shares' assets are in cash, compared with about 10% a year ago and 14% at the end of 1986.    The higher cash level is due largely to the general difficulty of plowing money into a stock market that keeps setting new highs, Mr. Price says. But he says &quot;a little part&quot; is due to the lack of deals.    &quot;There's not much merchandise&quot; at the moment in the sort of basic reorganizing company that the fund likes to buy into, such as LTV Corp., which is in Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law proceedings, and Smith International Inc., in which a Hong Kong investment concern holds a 15% stake.    This year so far, Mutual Shares was up 11.96% through Thursday, according to the Lipper rankings, compared with a gain of 17.92% for the Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index.    Mr. Price figures that about 10% to 12% of the fund's assets currently are invested in what he calls transaction stocks, about 45% are in what are considered to be undervalued issues, and 15% are in companies in various stages of bankruptcy-law proceedings.    The fund's basic strategy is to lock in a rate of return that beats the going rate on certificates of deposit by buying and selling stocks that are involved in &quot;done deals,&quot; as opposed to risk arbitrage, Mr. Price says.    While the deals may slow for a while, Mr. Price says, the insider-trading scandal has &quot;pulled half the money available for arbitrage out of Wall Street.&quot; He expects that money to come back and to wind up chasing fewer deals -- a scenario he sees as a plus for the specialized fund he heads.    Tom Bailey, president of Janus Capital Management, agrees that the &quot;rampant speculation&quot; and easy winnings are unlikely to continue, but he speaks from a somewhat different viewpoint.    The Janus Fund didn't join in the takeover play last year, although it does favor undervalued stocks that are in the throes of reorganization.    &quot;What we're really interested in is restructuring, not paper deals,&quot; Mr. Bailey says. Still, he concedes that the Janus Fund's 1986 gain of 11.22% &quot;should have been closer to what the market was doing.&quot;    &quot;We didn't play this takeover game, and it hurt us,&quot; he says. The Sandamp;P 500, including dividends, finished 1986 with a gain of 18.71%.    He also says, &quot;I don't think we had a great year in stock selection last year,&quot; and that further hurt performance.    Janus Capital, which manages five funds with about $700 million in assets, has reduced its emphasis on financial-services companies and is buying stocks that are &quot;on the cutting edge&quot; of a strengthening economy.    But the fund isn't abandoning its restructuring stocks, Mr. Bailey says, though some may take longer to pay off. &quot;Restructuring can be a lot of different things,&quot; he says. &quot;You don't have to be a Boone Pickens,&quot; buying companies and selling off parts of them.    Mr. Bailey says he sees long-term benefits in the proddings of Carl Icahn, Irwin Jacobs and others who have been called corporate raiders.    He says such people are &quot;forcing management to wake up and run the company for shareholders, not as their own personal fiefdom.&quot;    The concept of restructuring, he adds, is here to stay: &quot;I don't think the fact that they put a couple of guys in the slammer for misusing inside information is going to change that.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
