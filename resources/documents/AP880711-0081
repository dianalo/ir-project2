The University of Michigan added nearly 24,628 names to its listof potential major donors by asking a quarter-million alumni tofill out a detailed census.   Michigan, which raised $62 million last year and garnered $173million in a multi-year ``Campaign for Michigan,'' consulted with asociologist and behavioral psychologist in framing its four-pagequestionnaire in 1986.   The Michigan grads were asked not only their job andbiographical data, but their personal and household income, howthey felt about their alma mater, and whether they were sendingtheir children to Ann Arbor.   ``We didn't say it was or it wasn't'' going to be used to gaugetheir capacity to give, said Margaret Fisher, a Michigandevelopment office worker. Nearly 115,000 alumni responded, and 86percent gave their income.   The university ranked the potential major donors in 24categories and also identified what another Michigan developmentofficer calls ``persistent non-donors'' who may be dropped fromfuture solicitations.   Fund-raising is big business for colleges and universities. Someemploy specialists by the score whose full-time job is to convincepeople to unleash their charitable instinct.   Sixty-five campuses have embarked on drives to raise more than$100 million apiece. Washington University in St. Louis recentlywrapped up a campaign with a record $607 million in hand, andStanford University has passed the halfway mark in a $1.1 billiondrive launched last year.   The stock market collapse last October made the going tougher,but it has not derailed any of the major drives.   Stanford, which took in $198 million last year alone, is ``alittle bit behind in gifts this year _ 14 or 15 percent _ comparedto last year, but so is everybody else,'' said David Fulton,director of communications for the university's development office.   Not all the information on wealthy prospects comes from alumnithemselves.   Many campus development offices _ as the fund-raising operationsare called _ have researchers combing public records for clues onwhom to approach. Some hire commercial firms to do theirprospecting.   ``Once confined to consulting dusty alumni files, research ondonors today can include checks of land holdings, court records ofestate and divorce proceedings, stock proxies, tax forms andmemberships in clubs and on corporate boards,'' the Chronicle ofHigher Education noted in its June 22 issue.   ``In fact, college researchers who study donors are so much likedetectives that they even refer to potential contributors as`suspects,''' the Chronicle reported.   Sometimes, it added, ``they step on a few toes,'' as when onelandowner was outraged to learn from a county clerk that a collegeresearcher was probing into the size of his holdings.   Kathleen Foley, who checks prospects for Carleton College, toldthe Chronicle that to remain unobtrusive, some researchers sendrequests for information on plain white stationery and have theresponses sent to their home addresses.   According to Gerlinda S. Melchiori, the University of Michigan'sdeputy director of administrative services for development andcommunications, alumni surveys can yield ``what every fund-raiserdreams of: an in-house prospect ranking system.''   Writing in the July-August issue of Currents, a magazinepublished by the Council for Advancement and Support of Education,Melchiori said Michigan used profiles of 2,800 known major donorsto prepare the list of 24,628 new prospects _ ``more than membersof our major gift staff have time to pursue,'' Melchiori noted.   The rankings, she said, ``help us determine who deservesadditional prospect research and who warrants immediate follow-up.''   The same computer techniques can be used to figure out who isn'tlikely to respond to the pitch.   ``We're now analyzing our so-called persistent non-donors. Wecan identify alumni who share their characteristics and thus mustlikely would not be responsive to mail solicitation. We will thenbe able to drop people in those groups from our annual mailings,''Melchiori wrote.   Fisher emphasized, ``We're not releasing any information onindividuals to anyone outside the university.''</TEXT></DOC>
