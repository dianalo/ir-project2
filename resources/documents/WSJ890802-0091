In 1985 he was working as the executive chef at a suburban Holiday Inn here. He had a wife, a new baby and a dream of someday becoming a chef at the White House. But he also lived with a secret he shared with no one, not even his wife: He was addicted to crack, the highly potent form of cocaine.    &quot;I'm 6-foot-1 and weigh 250 pounds, and the first time I smoked crack, it brought me to my knees,&quot; Mr. Eargle recalls. &quot;I knew that I had found heaven. Actually, it was hell. My life started going downhill very quickly. My heart started racing. I started feeling paranoid. I kept the curtains pulled because I thought people were looking in at me. I started missing work. I broke down crying at work.&quot; And his $200-a-day habit was driving him deep into debt.    One night in 1986, when Mr. Eargle was only 28 years old, he experienced sharp chest pains that he quickly concluded were a reaction to the cocaine. He dialed the nationwide cocaine hotline that refers callers to treatment programs. With that call, Curtis Eargle began a struggle to recover from his addiction.    As many as 50,000 cocaine users will begin such battles this year. Many will fail, at least on the first try, because cocaine, and especially the highly addictive crack form of it, is a particularly difficult addiction to shake.    The rampant drug use of recent years has fueled an explosion in the demand for treatment. Private centers are usually filled, even though they charge $15,000 or more a month.    For those who can't afford private treatment, public and other subsidized centers are even more overburdened. At New York City's Daytop Village, the waiting list has doubled to nearly 2,000 people in the last year. Addicts must wait four to five months just to begin treatment there.    What's more, many treatment centers for the poor &quot;may not provide the level, type, or length of treatment best indicated for a particular abuser's needs,&quot; says Elaine Johnson, head of the federal Office for Substance Abuse Prevention.    The treatment of addiction is far from an exact science. Some respected programs believe in outpatient treatment that provides extensive counseling while the addicts continue to work and live at home. Other programs begin with a month in a psychiatric hospital or treatment center, followed by outpatient counseling. Sometimes experts recommend residential treatment that removes addicts from their former environment for as long as 18 months.    &quot;There are thousands of things out there called treatment programs,&quot; says Bush administration drug czar William Bennett. &quot;There are places that are fly-by-night operations that are taking in money and not doing a thing. We need evaluation. We need accountability. We need to know what works.&quot;    The consensus among doctors who specialize in this field is that at least a year of treatment, starting with intense therapy for a month or more and continuing with weekly meetings and counseling sessions, is necessary to overcome an addiction. The type and intensity of program needed, they say, depends on the addict.    The day after he called the cocaine hotline, Mr. Eargle started seeing a Washington psychologist, Ronald Wynne, three times a week. Such treatment works for a small percentage of addicts, but most need more intensive therapy. Mr. Eargle was one who needed more than outpatient counseling. &quot;I wasn't doing it for myself. I was doing it to appease my wife,&quot; he recalls.    As a result, he continued to use cocaine while in treatment, and on July 25, 1986, Beverly Eargle caught her husband smoking crack. She called Mr. Wynne, who had Mr. Eargle committed to Taylor Manor, a private psychiatric hospital in Ellicott City, Md.    For the first time, he faced the reality of dealing with his addiction and living without drugs. &quot;They took everything away from me -- wallet, keys, cigarette lighter, belt. They locked me up in a room for three days until I detoxed. In the detox room, your body goes through some changes,&quot; he says, recalling &quot;weird dreams&quot; and the shakes. &quot;It was scary. But in a sense it was a relief that it was over. For 14 years my life had revolved around drugs.&quot;    &quot;In the early days of rehab your head is in a fog,&quot; Mr. Eargle says. Although cocaine flushes out of the body in several days, the craving continues, producing depression, anxiety and lack of concentration.    Mr. Eargle began regular group therapy sessions at Taylor Manor. These were difficult. &quot;Group therapy is like holding a mirror up to yourself,&quot; he says, and most dope addicts don't like what they see. &quot;We hated our therapist so much, we called him Dr. Dirt. We were all good liars, but he made us tell the truth,&quot; Mr. Eargle says.    Drug addicts and alcoholics are masters of deception, particularly if they, like Mr. Eargle, manage to maintain a job and a marriage. They lie to themselves, their families, and their employers about their addictions.    At Taylor Manor, Mr. Eargle also began attending Narcotics Anonymous meetings. NA follows the same 12-step recovery process as Alcoholics Anonymous, the international self-help organization from which it emerged. To overcome their disease, people admit they can't control their addiction, seek help from God or some other higher power, apologize to people they have harmed and help other addicts to recover by following the same principles. Such meetings are crucial to almost all drug-addiction recovery programs, private or public.    &quot;The first night they called on me. I couldn't talk very well,&quot; Mr. Eargle says. &quot;I started crying. Somebody smiled at me. He said, 'You're going to be all right.' These people knew what I was going through. These are the same people who had crawled around on the floor looking for that last piece of coke. They were gamblers, alcoholics and drug addicts. They understood. There was love in that room.&quot;    Taylor Manor's program tries to teach its patients how to deal with anger, disappointment and other stress by showing them how to confront and express their emotions. During addiction &quot;ordinary coping mechanisms get put on hold because people are substituting drugs,&quot; says Joseph Chiarrocchi, Taylor Manor's director of addiction. Mr. Eargle agrees. &quot;If you use drugs, and you feel unhappy, you take more drugs.&quot;    Mr. Eargle's choice of 28 days in a &quot;crisis intervention&quot; facility, followed by sessions with a therapist and AA or NA meetings, is fairly standard for patients with health insurance. His insurance paid the $12,000 Taylor Manor bill and $25 of the $80 a session with Mr. Wynne, whom he saw for two years after he left Taylor Manor. AA and NA meetings, which he continued, are free.    Mr. Eargle says he was fortunate: He was able to get on track after his relatively short treatment. But his roommate at Taylor Manor reminded him of the fragility of recovery. He had started drinking again after 18 years of no liquor. But his attempt to recover again failed, and he died two years later.    &quot;The big thing that helped me was that when it was all over, I didn't have to cheat, I didn't have to lie, I didn't have to steal anymore,&quot; Mr. Eargle says. &quot;When the pain to quit is less than the pain to keep going, then you stop.&quot;    But his problems didn't end when he left Taylor Manor. Four months after he got home, he and his wife separated. &quot;When I got out I was 13 or 14 years old emotionally,&quot; says Mr. Eargle, who began drinking at age 12.    His psychologist, Mr. Wynne, says that such arrested development is fairly common among longtime drug users. &quot;To some extent your job as a teen-ager is to learn to deal with emotion. If you find a chemical that makes your emotion go away, you haven't done your job,&quot; he says.    Several months later, Mr. Eargle and his wife got back together. Mr. Eargle has been off drugs for nearly three years. &quot;Not every day is great now,&quot; he says. &quot;But it's better than it was. I remember where I was last night. I know how much I have in my wallet. I have two kids now. I own a house. I own stocks now. I have a 401k&quot; retirement plan.    But &quot;My addiction still haunts me,&quot; he says. &quot;I try to buy life insurance, and I can't; the price is exorbitant. When I go to the dentist, I have to tell him that I'm an addict so he doesn't give me too much Novocain.&quot;    Mr. Eargle currently works as the executive chef in a large private club, where he supervises 33 people and the preparation of about 1,000 meals a day and where his employer knows that he is in drug rehabilitation. But his past drug use has shattered his dream of a job at the White House, he says. &quot;I guess that's out.&quot;    To stay clean of drugs, he attends NA and AA meetings regularly, sometimes several times a week. On Monday nights, he frequently goes to an NA meeting at Montgomery Hills Baptist Church in suburban Silver Spring, Md. This gathering has grown from about 30 people a year ago to 100 on an average night.    The group has the air of a revival meeting. People greet each other with hugs as they crowd into a room filled with rows of folding chairs arranged around a table in the middle. Throughout the meeting, people volunteer accounts of their efforts to deal with stress and other problems and to stay drug-free. During a section when buttons are handed out to people who have been clean for a month, 90 days, a year, the wildest applause and loudest shouts rise for people who have just decided to give up drugs and made it through the first 24 hours. The meeting closes with a prayer and the chant: &quot;Keep coming back. It works.&quot;    Mr. Eargle says he delights in helping new members by showing them that it's possible to stay clean. &quot;You have to give it away to keep it,&quot; he says, repeating an NA maxim. &quot;When a new person comes, we need him,&quot; Mr. Eargle says. &quot;We need to remind ourselves of what it was like.&quot;    Even so, he finds the meetings difficult because they often trigger a craving for crack, a craving that he finds the group also helps him resist. A number of studies under way show that there is no easy cure for cocaine. To remain clean, many addicts, like Curtis Eargle, may have to be in treatment for life.    &quot;It's not hard getting clean and sober,&quot; he says. &quot;What's hard is staying clean and sober. We're all one drug away from going out again. It keeps me clean to be able to talk to other addicts -- to tell my hopes and fears and dreams. I show them it can be done. If you want it bad enough, you'll do it. If you want new life, you'll find it.&quot;    ---@ Calling for Help on Drug and Alcohol Problems @ 1-800-COCAINE National Cocaine Hotline @ 1-800-662-HELP National Institute on Drug @ Abuse, Drug Information Service @ 1-212-686-1100 Alcoholics Anonymous @ (not toll free) @ 1-800-ALCOHOL National referral helpline to @ local AA and rehabilitation @ groups @ 1-800-NCA-CALL National Council on Alcoholism @ Helpline @ 1-800-344-2666 Al-Anon Family Support Groups @ referral @ 1-800-843-4971 Drug Free Work Place Helpline @ 1-800-241-7946 PRIDE -- Parents Resource @ Institute for Drug Education- @ Drug Information Hotline </TEXT></DOC>
