(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Environmental abuse appears to beheating the Earth, damaging lungs, poisoning lakes, defacingmonuments and shrinking the food supply, scientists warned Tuesdayat a conference of chemists.   ``Six of the warmest years in the last 100 occurred in the'80s,'' said Stephen Schneider, deputy director of the NationalCenter for Atmospheric Research. ``And I'll give you odds that the'90s will be warmer than the '80s.''   Doomsday scenarios of global warming, acid rain and ozonedepletion _ once only the province of radical environmentalists _topped the agenda at the American Chemical Society convention.   The amount of carbon dioxide, the largest component of the``greenhouse effect,'' has increased by 25 percent in the atmospheresince the industrial revolution began, and 10 percent since 1950.Methane, another heat-trapping gas, has doubled.   The warmth will generate more killer hurricanes, change farmingareas to deserts and raise sea levels high enough to cause majorflooding and salinization of coastal water supplies and farm lands,Schneider said.   A worst-case scenario would raise the temperature over the next100 years by up to 10 degrees Farenheit, or more than the differencebetween the ice ages and warmer intervals _ and that took 10,000years to change.   ``We probably entered (global warming) two decades ago, but itwill take another two decades or so to be sure,'' he said. ``Theproblem is, the experiment is in a laboratory called the earth.''   Prompted by growing environmental concerns, the chemical society,which represents more than 137,000 chemists nationwide and has metannually for 198 years, scheduled three days of special sessionsthis week on atmospheric chemistry and the environment, and receivedscores of related papers.   A Texas Aandamp;M researcher found that increased ultraviolet light _an effect of the thinning ozone layer _ seems to kill phytoplanktonin the Antarctic. The tiny plants, which Sayed El-Sayed calls the``grass of the sea,'' are the basis for the entire marine food chain.   A paper from the University of Copenhagen said human beings mayalready be feeling increased acidic air pollution in their lungs,including chronic bronchitis among those already suffering fromasthma.   William Wilson, of the Atmospheric Research and ExposureAssessment Laboratory, showed that air pollution is becoming a majorissue in art and monument conservation around the world. A paper byDavid Pimentel of Cornell traced the increasing insect-caused lossesof corn and other crops despite a 1,000-fold increase in the use ofpolluting pesticides, and suggested other forms of managing farmyield.   Canadian government pollution expert Hans Martin painted a gloomypicture of acid rain in his country, saying half of the nation's720,000 lakes were affected by the fallout from sulfur and nitrogencompound pollution.   Martin showed pictures of accelerating forest damage over thepast decade from Canada to Czechoslovakia, saying little isunderstood about the phenomenon, but it is clearly worsening.   The death of the trees may be caused by pollution mobilizingaluminum in the soil _ and aluminum, Martin notes, is also blamedfor contributing to Alzheimer's disease in humans.   ``Our society has messed up for 10 to 20 years, and will mess upfor 10 more years,'' he warned.   But one of the most important changes has already occurred, mostof the speakers agreed. Martin said environmental concerns arealready listed by Canadians as their biggest concern.   Schneider said that since the long, hot summer of 1988, theinterest in global warming has increased astronomically.</TEXT></DOC>
