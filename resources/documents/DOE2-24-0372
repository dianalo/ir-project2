<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-24-0372 </DOCNO><TEXT>Thin-film multilayer reflections for polarizing neutrons have been fabricatedby sputtering bilayers of ferromagnetic iron (Fe) and non-magnetic silicon(Si) onto flat glass substrates. The multilayers were deposited accordingto the independent variation of one of four parameters: number of bilayers;bilayer thickness (D-spacing); argon sputtering gas pressure; and targetpower. The relationship between the measured neutron reflectivities ofthese multilayers and the expected theoretical values is discussed withrespect to the deposition parameters. 6 refs., 2 figs., 4 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
