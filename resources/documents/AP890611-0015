Under Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the InternationalDepartment of the Communist Party Central Committee has shiftedcourse, loosening its ties with Marxist parties in the West andcultivating relations with other less radical elements, said thedefector, Evgeny Novikov.   ``Gorbachev started to promote the principles of his `newthinking,' to find new clients, sometimes at the expense of oldclients, to find parties and groups that have influence incapitalist countries,'' Novikov said in a recent interview with TheAssociated Press.   The new approach has brought closer Soviet ties to American andWestern European environmental and peace groups that agree withGorbachev's approach to disarmament and attempts to lesseninternational tension, said Novikov.   Because his work in the International Department centered on Araband Middle Eastern affairs, Novikov declined to speculate on whichWestern groups were sympathetic to Gorbachev's new approach.   U.S. intelligence officials, who said they were not familar withthe specifics of Novikov's case, confirmed that Novikov'sdescription met their understanding of the International Department.   They said most U.S. and Western European groups weresophisticated enough to remain independent even while developingcontacts with Soviet officials known to be linked to theInternational Department.   The International Department, for which Novikov worked from 1970until his defection last year, was the successor to the Comintern,or Communist International, or later the Cominform, disbanded byJosef Stalin in 1947.   The Comintern was the main organ of Kremlin influence oncommunist parties outside the Soviet Union, a means of moldingpolitical platforms and sometimes recruiting intelligence agents,according to numerous accounts by defectors.   The International Department shares with the Foreign Ministryresponsibility for formulating Soviet foreign policy, which isdecided by the ruling Politburo, Novikov said. The Foreign Ministrycarries out state-to-state contacts, while the InternationalDepartment handles party-to-party matters.   Senior International Department experts are driven in chauffeuredcars, receive salaries equal to those of deputy ministers and haveaccess to intelligence reports from the ministries of defense andforeign affairs, and the KGB, Novikov said in a paper prepared forthe U.S. government.   Shortly after Gorbachev rose to power in March 1985, he tried togain control of the International Department and change its innerworkings by appointing as its chief Anatoly Dobrynin, who had servedas the Soviet ambassador to Washington since the 1960s.   ``Dobrynin, however, was very much an outsider'' to the Moscowbureaucracy, Novikov said. Thus Dobrynin's reform attemptsfoundered, forcing Gorbachev to move him from the Central CommitteeSecretariat into a newly created post as adviser.   ``The old timers in the International Department opposedDobrynin,'' said Novikov. ``The old cadres sabotaged Dobryinin.''   Last fall, Gorbachev reorganized the Central CommitteeSecretariat, naming his right-hand man, Aleksandr Yakovlev, as headof a newly created International Commission, which controls theInternational Department.   The new head of the International Department is Valentin Falin, aformer ambassador to West Germany.   Before the reorganization, said Novikov, many of the seniorofficials in the International Department dated back to the days ofMikhail Suslov and Boris Ponomarev, two Stalinist holdovers whoserved under the late Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev.   Novikov lectured from 1970 to 1985 in the Institute for SocialSciences, which he described as a secret school run by theInternational Department in Moscow. His job was to conduct seminarsin political philosophy for small groups of students from Marxistparties in South Yemen, Syria and Iraq and for two radicalPalestinian groups, the Democratic Front for the Liberation ofPalestine and the Peoples Front for the Liberation of Palestine.   Professors at the institute drew up classified reports on thosemovements, based in part on what the students said in class.   ``For example, I made a study of the Yemeni Socialist Party, itsorigins, history, influence of Marxism, influence of Islam,influence on the masses,'' said Novikov.   From 1985 until his defection, Novikov was chief of the Arabiceditorial office of the World Marxist Review in Prague,Czechoslovakia.   Arabic versions of the magazine ``were printed mostly in Westerncountries, and distributed in various Arab countries under titlesvery different from the original.   ``The goal was to pretend it was a national magazine, produced ineach nation, but 70-100 percent of it was prepared in Prague ...under directions from the International Department,'' said Novikov.``Nowhere did it say it was printed in Prague. One percent of thereaders would know where it came from.''   Novikov crossed the border in Austria in March 1988, was givenasylum by the U.S. Embassy there and spent the next seven monthsbriefing Western officials.   Novikov, who has the Soviet equivalent of a doctorate, has beenliving in the United States since last September, working as abutler in a small hotel while he tries to launch a career as aconsultant in Soviet affairs.   In contrast to past Soviet defectors who complained aboutinsensitivity on the part of their CIA handlers, Novikov said he``met with a very human attitude from the United States government.''</TEXT></DOC>
