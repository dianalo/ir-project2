The real estate investment trust, which invests in single-family first lien mortgages and other mortgage securities, is required to distribute all of its taxable earnings to shareholders. It said the new dividend policy is designed to &quot;reduce quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in dividends,&quot; and doesn't reflect any expectation of lower earnings.    A spokeswoman said the REIT expects to pay 20 cents in each of the first three quarters under the new policy, with the fourth-quarter payment depending on the amount of remaining taxable earnings for the year.    Countrywide also said it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a proposed offering of four million common shares. The trust, which currently has 7.7 million shares outstanding, said proceeds would be used to make additional investments in loans and mortgage-backed securities, to repay debt and for other general corporate purposes. </TEXT></DOC>
