Tibetan mobs had ransacked Chinese-owned stores and burned theircontents, stoned government buildings and attacked Chinese indemonstrations for independence and an end to Chinese rule in theremote mountain area.   Official accounts said at least 12 people were killed and morethan 100 wounded. Unofficial reports had up to 75 people killed and300 injured.   Police imposed a temporary curfew and cleared the streets Tuesdayafternoon, threatening to shoot anyone found in the central squareor in the Tibetan section nearby, the traveler said by telephonefrom Lhasa.   At midnight, jeeps carrying loudspeakers sped through the cityordering residents to stay inside and informing them martial law hadbegun, he said.   It was the first time since the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution thatmartial law had been publicly announced in China.   Dozens of trucks packed with soldiers of the People's LiberationArmy later entered Lhasa, the American reported.   ``Soldiers were patrolling in the streets,'' said a report byXinhua, the official Chinese news agency, quoting Maj. Gen. ZhangShaosong, political commissar of the Tibet regional military command.   ``There's a lot of sirens going and a lot of troop movementoutside,'' said the American, who spoke on condition of not beingidentified for fear of police reprisals.   He said he was speaking from a hotel in the center of Lhasa andhad stopped looking out the window after a soldier came to thewindow and blocked his view.   ``Now I'm here with a blanket over my head in the office hopingthat no one will notice,'' he said, speaking in a muffled voice soas not to attract attention.   Xinhua said the whole city and parts of two adjoining countieswould be ``cordoned off'' and ``all meetings, parades, strikes,petitions and any other gathering are banned.'' The order also gavesecurity forces vast powers to stop vehicles and pedestrians in thecity of 70,000people.   No foreigners were allowed to enter Lhasa without permission, andthose in the area without permission were required to leave, theorder said. The American, who said he had not been informed of therule, estimated there were about 80 foreigners in Lhasa.   The nationally televised nightly news announced martial lawTuesday evening, saying the Lhasa city government had beenauthorized to take ``any measures necessary to restore order.''   ``Any person who defies martial law or who instigates others todo so will be severely punished,'' said the order, approved byChina's Cabinet and signed by Premier Li Peng.   Xinhua said martial law had been imposed because ``separatistshave been constantly causing disturbances in the city over the pastfew days.''   In Geneva, Chinese delegate Li Zuomin told the U.N. Human RightsCommission the riots were triggered by ``a few separatists (who) donot wish to see progress and better living standards in Tibet'' andby terrorists sent from outside. He said the violence ``endangeredthe security and sovereignty of China'' and forced authorities totake ``corresponding measures.''   On Sunday and Monday, clashes between police and Tibetans left 11Tibetans and one Chinese policeman dead, along with 100 wounded,official reports said. On Tuesday, Westerners quoted Tibetans assaying as many as 75 died and 300 were wounded _ including aninstance in which Chinese militia burst into homes and killed atleast five people.   Two groups of about 100 Tibetans marched Tuesday near the mainsquare and on Beijing Road, the main thoroughfare. Police thencleared the streets, the American said. Sounds of gunfire crackledin the afternoon.   ``All the Tibetans just disappeared, everybody just evaporated,''said the American, who was given shelter in a Tibetan house. But bynightfall, Tibetans began to venture outside again and a bonfireblazed on Beijing Road after Tibetans ransacked and burned anotherChinese store.   Martial law was not imposed in outbreaks of pro-independenceviolence in Lhasa in the past 18 months that left scores dead andhundreds hurt.   The government last imposed martial law during the ultra-leftistCultural Revolution in 1966-76 when bands of Red Guards fought armedbattles on the streets of dozens of cities. A form of martial lawwas declared on all of Tibet on March 23, 1959, after an aborteduprising against Chinese rule.   China claims Tibet has been part of China since the 13th century.Many Tibetans say Tibet should be independent and led by thetraditional Tibetan leader, the Dalai Lama, who fled in exile duringthe aborted uprising in 1959.   On Monday, the Dalai Lama appealed to world leaders to persuadethe Chinese to find a peaceful solution to the protests.   The Dalai Lama has proposed that China grant Tibet autonomy inits internal affairs in exchange for the stationing of Chinesetroops on Tibetan soil and the management of Tibet's foreignrelations by Beijing. China has rejected the proposal but isconsidering the Dalai Lama's proposal of negotiations.   In India, the Dalai Lama's administration said Tuesday it was notsurprised by the imposition of martial law.   ``For all practical purposes Lhasa was already under martial law.The Chinese have only formalized it,'' said Tashi Wongdi, theTibetan leader's chief representative in New Delhi, when contactedby telephone.</TEXT></DOC>
