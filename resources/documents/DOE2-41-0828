Background information on theprovince's energy situation shows that it has no conventional energysources and must rely on imported energy to satisfy most of its demand.Policies have been implemented by the provincial government to ensureenergy security and fair energy pricing, including regulation of petroleumbased fuel prices. To overcome the Island's high electricity prices,an interprovincial electricity grid is proposed to encourage and permitthe free flow of electrical energy within Canada. And, as an alternativeto these conventional energy sources, recent developments in biomassenergy are described, including wood chip fired boilers used to heatgovernment buildings, and a 10 MW wood chip fired power plant plannedto be operational in the early 1990s.</TEXT></DOC>
