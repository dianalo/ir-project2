Or do you just want to use the same script language you're alreadyusing with your editor and with DOS?andM;If you're using Personal REXX, Mansfield Software's PC version of the REXXprogramming language, you're in luck.andP;  Quercus Systems' new communicationsprogram for DOS and OS/2, Rexxterm, uses Mansfield's REXX as its scriptlanguage, and it packs such powerful features as a built-in Xedit-like texteditor and the ability to recall, edit, and resend text previously sent to aremote computer.andM;Developed by IBM for its mainframes, REXX is IBM'S Saa-standard commandlanguage.andP;  To further ensure REXX'S future importance, IBM is including aversion of it with OS/2 1.2 Extended Edition.andP;  Mansfield's implementation,Personal REXX, serves as an advanced batch language for DOS or OS/2, and asan advanced macro facility for the vendor's Kedit text editor (see FirstLooks, PC Magazine, October 31, 1988, p. 54), making it a good choice forREXXterm's communications script language.andM;Beyond its being a personal programming tool, REXX is a complete languagesupporting variables and arrays, looping and conditional control structures,file and device 1/0, and a library of built-in functions-all of which nicelyround out REXXterm's own impressive list of features.andP;  Among these is abuilt-in ASCII file editor, which lets you edit multiple filessimultaneously.andP;  You can use the editor or a built-in file browser duringfile transfers.andM;REXXterm's command history lets you edit any of the last 20 lines of textsent to a remote computer and then resend it-a real timesaver if you oftenretype the same text.andM;The program lets you capture a communications session to memory, disk, or theprinter.andP;  When you capture to memory, the capture buffer can be as large asavailable memory, including EMS.andP;  You can scroll through the capture buffer,edit it using the built-in editor, search it for strings, or copy portions ofit to other files or to the printer.andP;  Accessing the capture buffer is as easyas hitting the PgUp key, which places you in the built-in editor.andP;  You canaccess the capture buffer at any time during a session.andM;When you choose to save captured information to disk, you can have REXXtermgenerate a unique filename for you.andP;  For example, specifying a pattern likeFILE????.DOC would generate FILE0001.DOC, if that name didn't already existin the current or specified directory.andP;  If it did exist, FILE0002.DOC wouldbe used.andM;When used inside of a REXX script, for example, you could have REXXtermgenerate a unique filename for saving the transcript of each session.andM;REXXterm is extremely reconfigurable, allowing you to create andautomatically load single-key macros.andP;  You can assign commands to just aboutany key, and you can change all of the defaults.andP;  For example, if you'drather have the Up Arrow key bring you into the capture buffer instead of thePgUp key, that's no problem.andP;  Using either the menu system or REXX scripts,you can customize the environment to your liking.andP;  In addition, you canassign defaults for things like what file transfer protocol to use or whereto place downloaded files.andP;  Even entire REXX scripts can be tied to akeystroke.andM;The program supports several file-transfer protocols, among them Xmodem,Xmodem1K, Ymodem batch, Zmodem, Kermit, and CompuServe-B.andP;  In addition, itoffers several pacing options for ASCII file uploads.andM;REXXterm supports multiple dialing directories, each of which can hold anynumber of entries.andP;  A REXX procedure can be linked to each entry andautomatically invoked upon connection.andP;  You can select a list of numbers tobe called automatically.andP;  REXXterm records the date and time of the lastconnection, and it maintains a count of the total number of calls for eachentry.andM;A buil]-in file manager lists files from any directory in a window, and itlets you invoke certain REXXterm functions against any file in the list usinga point-and-shoot interface-a handy feature if you can't remember a filenameor want to check on a file's existence.andM;All major functions in REXXterm are available either through menus, a commandline, or user-definable keystrokes.andP;  Internally, REXXterm is entirelycommand-driven, so you can use the interface with which you're mostcomfortable.andP;  Commands issued through the command line are the same ones youwould use from within REXX scripts.andP;  A command-line history feature lets yourecall and reissue past commands.andM;REXXterm is an impressive product.andP;  When combined with Personal REXX, itprovides unprecedented programmability.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
