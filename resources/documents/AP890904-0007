Billions of cocaine dollars are making their way into and in somecases corrupting the economies of Colombia, Peru, Bolivia and morerecently Ecuador on a scale that approaches the amounts they earnfrom legal exports.   Cocaine cartels, producers and traffickers have establishedvirtual autonomous states in remote areas and, with the support oflocal coca-growing peasants, operate out of the reach of the law.   Anti-government guerrillas in Peru are arming themselves withmillions of dollars from drug cartels and traffickers, with whomthey have allied themselves in their attempts to seize power.   In Colombia, traffickers have formed private armies withintelligence-gathering units, modern weapons and fleets of aircraft.In the past decade, they have killed 220 judges and other courtemployees, two newspaper editors, a justice minister, an attorneygeneral, hundreds of policemen and soldiers and dozens of othersperceived as a threat to their business.   But it was the assassination last month of the popularpresidential candidate Luis Carlos Galan that left the nation inoutrage and prompted the government to launch all-out war againstthe cartels.   In Bolivia and Peru, however, officials say the overall waragainst the cocaine trade will be lost without a regional effort andgreater resources for effective coca-leaf reduction and interdictionprograms. Peasant coca farmers in the far reaches of Bolivia andPeru are the suppliers for the traffickers of cocaine to the UnitedStates and Europe.   ``The implications for Colombia and for other Latin Americannations, where narcotraffickers are able to amass huge fortunes, arecrucial,'' the U.S. ambassador to Bolivia, Robert S. Gelbard, saidin an interview. ``The traffickers in a variety of ways are out tosuborn and destroy the democratic system in Bolivia as in othercountries of the region. This is nothing less than a war to decidewho will govern these countries.''   Gelbard added: ``Both producing and consuming nations should takeheed of what is happening in Colombia. There is no such thing asbenign drug production or consumption. The sovereignty of producingnations is a little less secure with every new acre of coca plantedand with every dollar spent on a cocaine high.''   ``What we require is a regional approach to the problem becauseotherwise whatever plans we have in Bolivia would be affected byevents in other countries,'' said Gonzalo Torrico, under secretaryof the interior in charge of Bolivia's drug interdiction programs.   Already there is concern that the offensive against the Colombiancartels will drive the traffickers to other South American nationswhere vast areas are unpatrolled and lack radar to control airtraffic. Increased border patrols have already been set up inBrazil, Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia.   So far, the U.S. government's anti-drug strategy in South Americahas been based on an effective interdiction program involving theseizure of chemicals used to process coca leaves and the destructionof cocaine-producing facilities. The intent was to drive down theprice of coca leaves and encourage farmers to shift to other crops.   Operation ``Snowcap,'' a multi-nation cocaine interdictionprogram central to the U.S. strategy, has destroyed since itsinception in 1987 more than 200 cocaine labs and seized more than 43metric tons of cocaine.   U.S. drug agents and local police forces have in recent yearsincreased their operating capacity but as police activities becomemore effective, traffickers use their vast resources to bribejudges, district attorneys and police officials.   Despite a greater U.S. presence in drug producing nations,cocaine production continues to rise by 10 percent a year, a U.S.State Department report says. As a result, cocaine prices in theUnited States have steadily declined, making cocaine and crack moreavailable. Europe and Asia are now the growth markets for cocaine.   Peru, Bolivia and Colombia produced 348 to 454 metric tons ofpure cocaine in 1988, according to U.S. government figures.   With cocaine selling wholesale in Miami for $15,000 a kilo (2.2pounds) or higher and retailing for $50,000 to $120,000, the valueof South America's cocaine is worth at least $5 billion wholesaleand at least $17 billion retail, many times the legal exports ofdrug-producing nations.   In Bolivia, an impoverished country of 6.9 million people, thecocaine produced is worth at least $1.7 billion wholesale. From thatan estimated $300 million to $500 million flows back into theeconomy, compared with $600 million for all legal exports combined.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
