The Labor Department said the growth was again foundpredominantly in the service-producing sector of the economy, whichadded 140,000 of the new jobs.   The civilian joblessness rate declined from the 5.3 percentreported for June. The government also revised its figures on newjobs created in June to 250,000, up sharply from the 180,000reported last month.   ``We have a soft economy but one that appears to have beenstronger in July than in May and June,'' said chief economist AllenSinai of Boston Co. Economic Advisers Inc. ``This certainly shouldease fears of imminent recession.''   Michael Boskin, the Bush administration's top economic adviser,said the report ``suggests the economy is continuing to expand.''He said the July job growth brought to 20 million the number of newjobs created during the record-long expansion, which began in late1982.   Today's report contained further evidence of persistent wageinflation.   The department said hourly earnings of production andnonsupervisory workers increased 0.8 percent in July _ about twicethe rate analysts had predicted _ while average weekly earningsclimbed by 1.7 percent. The jump in hourly earnings followed twomonths of modest increases.   Goods-producing industries added 29,000 new positions asconstruction posted a gain of 35,000 jobs, helping to offset adecline of more than 10,000 jobs in the automobile industry.   Manufacturing posted a modest gain of 3,000 jobs last monthafter three months of declines, according to the Labor Department'ssurvey of business establishments.   In all, 117.4 million Americans were at work in non-farm jobslast month, the government said.   The average work week for production and nonsupervisoryemployees in private industry increased by 0.3 hours, to 34.9hours. The factory work week held steady at 41 hours and overtimein July averaged 3.9 hours a week, up from 3.8 hours in June, theLabor Department said.   The jump in hourly earnings brought average hourly pay in theprivate sector to $9.70 on a seasonally adjusted basis, up from$9.62 in June.   Weekly earnings rose to an average of $338.53 from the Juneaverage of $332.85.   The government said the summer expansion of the youth laborforce in the past four months has totaled about 3.1 million, aboutthe same as recent years despite a significant drop in the youthpopulation.   The unemployment rate fell last month despite a dip in thenumber of Americans at work from 117.5 million to 117.4 million.The rate fell because the 169,000 new jobs were created in a monthin which the civilian labor force _ the number of people who havejobs or are looking for them _ fell by 146,000.   Evidence of a number of recent economic developments could befound in today's unemployment report, the first comprehensive lookat the economy's performance in July.   The data showed employment in the mining industry fell by 11,000jobs _ the result of a coal strike in Virginia, West Virginia andKentucky that also has led to wildcat walkouts in othercoal-producing states.   The rebound in construction coincides with reports showing aupswing in housing starts and home sales.   And the decline in auto manufacturing follows recentannouncements by major automakers that they are cutting productionbacause of sluggish sales.   The 140,000 job growth in the service-producing sector camedespite a 25,000 drop in the number of government jobs.   Elsewhere in that sector, retail trade added 52,000 jobs,wholesale trade 5,000, transportation and public utilities 23,000and finance, insurance and real estate 11,000. Employment inservices was up by 74,000 positions and both business and healthservices posted modest gains, the government said.   The payroll and wage data is taken from the Labor Department'ssurvey of businesses. A separate household survey found few majorshifts in unemployment among demographic groups, althoughjoblessness among black teen-agers fell to 33.1 percent last monthfrom 40.2 percent in June. The June total was up sharply from 28.4percent in May.   For white adult men, the unemployment rate was 3.8 percent lastmonth, up from 3.7 percent in June. Among adult white women, therate rose from 4.1 percent to 4.3 percent.   Unemployment among white teen-agers was 13.4 percent, up from12.6 percent in June.   Among blacks, the overall jobless rate was 10.9 percent, downfrom 11.9 percent in June. Unemployment fell from 9.4 percent to9.3 percent for adult black men and from 10.5 percent to 9.9percent among black women.   The government said 9 percent of Hispanics in the civilian laborforce were unemployed in July, up from 8.1 percent in June.   A separate calculation of unemployment that includes members ofthe armed services stationed in the United States was also 5.2percent in July, unchanged from June.</TEXT></DOC>
