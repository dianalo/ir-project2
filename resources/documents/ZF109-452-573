 IBM is tired of being seenas a puppet of Microsoft's development labs.andP;  IBM is tired of Apple alwaysgetting the credit for improving the state of computing for users.andP;  IBM istired of watching Sun Microsystems turn a virtual clone of its own strategyinto another new multi-billion business that IBM can't influence.andP;  IBM istired of constantly being identified as the dinosaur company that can't getpast its mainframe heritage and join the modern world.andP;  IBM is tired of nothaving any friends in Silicon Valley.andM;IBM isn't going to take it anymore.andP;  And its agreement to form a new venturecalled Patriot Partners in partnership with Metaphor Computer Systems is thefirst explicit signal that it has begun to change direction and try to put astop to this notion that other companies can actually set standards withoutconsulting IBM first.andM;There have been signs that IBM has begun to shift its operating systemstrategy for some months now.The first sign was in October, 1988 when IBM andNext announced their deal to port Nextstep to the AIX version of Unix andIBM's own RISC processor (now incorporated into the RS/6000 workstation).andO;IBM still has not shipped Nextstep for AIX to any customers, even though itwas most recently scheduled to become available this summer (whichtechnically ends next Saturday, September 22).andP;  And it seems certain now thatthe deal was motivated and signed by executives who are no longer with IBM because their point of view no longer found favor in Armonk), so it can'tnecessarily be viewed as a strategic move by IBM  although it might have beenoriginally).andP;  As it stands, Nextstep for AIX is now positioned merely as oneof several alternatives available on AIX on the RS/6000 and PS/2 hardwareplatforms and therefore doesn't demonstrate which of the alternatives IBM iswilling to invest its corporate resources in.andM;The next sign was the announcement of Office Vision in May, 1989.andP;  In thisannouncement, which involved several other product announcements includingthe now-significant licensing of Metaphor's DIS software for OS/2, IBM'sApplications Software Division in Milford, Connecticut announced a new layerof software for distributed networks that provided integrated officeautomation features across OS/2 and IBM's other strategic operating systems.andO;Office Vision gave really good demo and demonstrated that IBM could create adecent-looking system if it tried, but it also turned out to be about aspoorly programmed as only IBM could manage (requiring about 12 megabytes ofmemory to operate reasonably well).andM;The next sign of a shift was a series of rumors last fall and spring.andP;  Thefirst of these had IBM developing or contracting for the development of a PMLite interface for DOS.andP;  Last spring, there was another series about IBMshifting responsibility for OS/2 programming completely to Microsoft andre-organizing its own programming resources to work on IBM-developedproducts.andP;  Rumors of this magnitude almost always turn out to have some basisin truth, even if IBM never actually admits what the truth was.andP;  Since thesehave all been rumors, all they can really indicate is that IBM has beenhaving difficulty making up its mind, which means that executives fromdifferent divisions or groups within IBM have been disagreeing with eachother about what to do with its operating-system strategy.andP;  If IBM executivescan't agree on a strategy, it generally means they are not happy with thecurrent situation and are looking for a change, which means some process ofnegotiation and disagreement.andP;  This process has been going on at all levelsof the company as it struggles to adapt to the new realities of PC-based,networked, distributed computing with open standards.)andM;The next sign was the announcement in July of IBM's agreement to licensewhatever system software came out of Go Corp.'s development labs.andP;  While whatthat software is isn't clear since Go has not announced a specific productwith features and pricing, the announcement is the first indication that IBMis now willing to incorporate incompatible system software into pieces ofhardware that are very much like a personal computer.andP;  One would assume that,if Go is to successfully pursue a strategy of licensing its software, it hasto create a complete operating system for pen-based computers.andP;  And Go hasn'tbeen too shy about saying that it believes pen-based computing is notnecessarily restricted to mobile computers and that it can be as big anopportunity as personal computers themselves.andP;  If IBM agrees with thosefundamental notions - and it would be hard to imagine that the company wouldgo to the trouble of licensing a startup company's brand-new system softwarefor a niche opportunity - then one would have to imagine that IBM not onlyviews Go as a supplier of system software but as a strategic defense againstbeing held ransom by Microsoft as well as a learning opportunity for its ownengineers.andM;The most recent sign of a shift in IBM's operating system strategy is themost explicit.andP;  IBM and Metaphor have said that their new partnership willcreate a new set of software that will run on both OS/2 and AIX which willallow software developers to create one piece of software to work with boththe client and network operating systems on any one instruction set (eitherIntel or IBM RISC).andP;  In addition, this new &quot;applications environment' willbring to the system the ability to easily and naturally use suchstate-ofthe-art technology as object-oriented programming (with classlibraries, which is what Next calls mailable objects), multimedia hardware,experts systems programming, and visual programming.andP;  (Patriot will amount toa similar collection of software to what Hewlett Packard's New Wave 3.0 andparts of New Wave Office represents as an extension to Windows, except thatit will be made for OS/2 and AIX instead of for OS/2 and OSF/1, and it willbe under IBM's direct control and not HP's, and it will be more aggressivebecause it will completely isolate the application developer from theoperating systems.)andM;If successfully delivered, then, this new environment offers IBM theopportunity to get the application developers' attention away from Microsoft,which is one of the two key elements in Microsoft's now-proven ability to setstandards not endorsed by IBM (as demonstrated so far by the success ofWindows 3.0 and IBM's changes in its own LAN Server to be compatible withMicrosoft's LAN Manager).andP;  The other key element is to gain some credibilityin the industry as a company capable of recognizing and adopting newtechnologies without having to visit Redmond, Washington, first.andP;  For that,IBM is depending on Metaphor's (and, more specifically, Dave Liddle's)abilities to match Microsoft (and Next and Go and Apple and Sun) as a viableseer of technological changes.andM;For the first time, IBM is now working with a legitimate Silicon Valleyvisionary.andP;  Liddle worked at Xerox during the crucial period of developmentof the Alto and Star systems and, in his own company, clearly demonstratedthe value of object-oriented, visual database management systems.andP;  (Metaphoralso demonstrated the difficulty of selling proprietary, non-generalizedhardware-and-software systems, no matter how useful or technicallyinteresting they might be.) And, at least in IBM's mind, this appears to beevidence that they might be able to deliver the goods in Patriot, goods thatwill be competitive with systems being offered by other major systemscompanies in terms of getting developers interested in actually writing keyprograms that support it and in terms of getting customers interested inactually buying that software and using the new applications environment.andM;If it can deliver the goods with the Patriot software (which is not supposedto see the light of day for at least two years, since it is no farther alongthan a concept and an initial set of specifications, if that) along withwhatever it learns from the Next and Go relationships, then IBM will nolonger have to worry about people laughing at its software, seeing it as aMicrosoft puppet, giving Apple credit, giving its business away to Sun, orbeing called a dinosaur company.andP;  Instead, IBM will have a set of systemsoftware which it controls that incorporates the best Silicon Valley has tooffer in pen-based interfaces, object-oriented development systems,multimedia integration, and expert systems.andP;  And it will have reducedMicrosoft's role in its system software from primary or even sole vendor toone vendor of several, giving IBM the opportunity to determine how thedifferent pieces integrate and how software developers deal with thosepieces.andP;  IBM hopes that it will have truly joined the modem age of computingand gained some self respect and industry credibility.andP;  More important, itwants to finally be able to say to itself that it has some influence over itsown destiny.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
