The cutback was the latest sign of a high-tech industry slowdownthat has contributed to a softening of the region's economy.   ``Some fundamental things are happening that will drive all(computer) companies to do things differently or they will fail,''Wang president Richard Miller said.   Miller was named president of Wang in August, succeedingFrederick Wang, who had been ousted from the job by An Wang, hisfather, company founder and chairman.   Prior to Thursday's announcement, the company already had cutabout 5,000 jobs this year and announced plans to sell $200 millionin assets. Furthermore, Wang reported a first quarter loss of $62.1million in the first quarter that ended Sept. 30, and Millerpredicted more losses for the second quarter.   Miller said under the company's new approach, Wang will cut itsbureaucracy to get in closer touch with the needs of its customers.   ``We are eliminating the layers between the field andlaboratory,'' he said. ``We will eliminate entire functions _functions that I view as stifling.''   For example, he said, the company's product development programsoften duplicate efforts, with no single group takingresponsibility. As a result, products often have been introducedlate.   But Miller said departments will be combined, leading to astreamlined approach.   The reorganization of the company will mean the loss of about2,000 by Jan. 1, lowering the Wang workforce to just over 22,000,he said.   About 1,000 of the layoffs will occur in Massachusetts, mostlyat the company's headquarters in Lowell, with the rest beingscattered around the world.   A severance package for these employees will result in a onetimecharge of $30 million in the company's second quarter, which endsDec. 31.   Miller said the restructuring announced Thursday would cutannual costs by about $115 million, but he stressed that thecompany was not simply calculating how much needed to be cut inorder to be profitable.   The Massachusetts high-tech industry has suffered othersetbacks. Data General Corp. announced last month it wouldeliminate 2,200 jobs, and Digital Equipment Corp. recently offeredvoluntary severance to 700 workers.   ``I think restructuring is becoming a common word in thisindustry,'' Miller said.   Miller said much of Wang's bureaucracy grew while the high-techindustry was booming. But now the industry has reached a``maturing'' stage with slower growth, he said.   The bureaucracy ``just built up because of the luxury of verybig margins in a high growth industry,'' he said.   But while Miller pointed to the fluctuations in the computerindustry for many of his company's problems, analysts said some ofthe trouble _ particularly poor customer service _ has been uniqueto Wang.   ``They have had this problem with service and support for a longtime,'' said Steven Wendler, an analyst with Gartner Group Inc. inStamford, Conn. ``Rick Miller is a breath of fresh air.''   Also, Wendler said, after the company completes the cost-cuttingmeasures, ``the hemorrhaging, financially, will stop.''   ``A lot of Wang customers have the shakes right now,'' he said.   George Elling, an analyst with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner andSmith Inc. in New York, said during the 1970s and early 1980s, Wangdid not pay attention to customer service because it becameconfident as a leader in word processing equipment.   ``They had something everyone wanted,'' he said. ``People werewilling to put up with poorer service.''   ``Wang was too slow to recognize they needed to change,'' hesaid.   Part of the change, Miller said, will include more focus onsoftware and other computer applications.   ``Most customers are not crying for new technology,'' he said.``They are crying for new applications of technology.''</TEXT></DOC>
