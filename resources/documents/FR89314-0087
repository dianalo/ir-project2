Fenichel, NationalCommunications System, Telephone (202) 692-2124.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</T2>1. While proposals may be proprietary, the text of a draft standard (containingall interoperability-related requirements) must be publically disclosedupon solicitation of industry comment on the draft standard. In addition,all patents needed to implement the requirements of the standard must beoffered for license on a non-exclusive basis at reasonable rates (as isrequired for American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and InternationalTelegraph and Telephone Consultitive Committee (CCITT) standards).2. There are presently two public-safety trunked radio system techniquesbeing offered for sale to the Federal Government. Proposed techniques shouldbe capable of sufficient flexibility to include most, if not all, of thefeatures offered by these two systems. Both of the public-safety trunkedradio system manufacturers have been unwilling to disclose their techniquesand license patents as described above.3. Some features and performance characteristics felt to be very desirableare:a. Ability to assign channels to users employing 25 kHz channel analogvoice, 12.5 kHz channel analog voice, 25 KHz channel digitized voice ordata, 12.5 kHz channel digitized voice or data, and 6.25 kHz digitizedvoice or data.b. Ability to support a 20-channel LMR trunked radio system with one 12.5kHz or less trunked radio system control channel, while providing a rangeequal to that of 25 kHz channel analog voice.c. Ability to support a 20-channel system channel-loading in the same rangeas the two presently offered public-safety trunked radio system techniques,with response time and other requirements specified in APCO Project 16documents.d. Ability to operate in a network mode, individual-to-individual mode,and a telephone interconnect mode.4. While candidate trunked radio systems proposals are desired, other alternativesuggestions (e.g. development under Government funding) will be considered.<ITAG tagnum="6">Dennis Bodson,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Assistant Manager, NCS Technology and Standards.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-5882 Filed 3-13-89; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 3610-05-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
