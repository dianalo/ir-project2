Many big bond dealers and brokers vow to fight any proposed changes. They insist that the present system works well and that any changes could undermine the government bond market's efficiency, leading to higher Treasury borrowing costs.    Nevertheless, wider dissemination of bond price information appears increasingly likely, according to investment bankers, brokers and government officials interviewed at a U.S. General Accounting Office hearing yesterday. The hearing was conducted jointly with the Federal Reserve System, the Treasury and the Securities and Exchange Commission.    &quot;My gut feeling is that there won't be legislation on this, but that through moral suasion there will be some greater opening of the marketplace to allow wider access of information&quot; on government securities prices, said Edward J. Geng, president of Fundamental Brokers. Mr. Geng, formerly a senior vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, added: &quot;There is so much pressure on this issue, not just from the GAO hearings but from other areas,&quot; such as the Justice Department's investigation into possible antitrust violations by U.S. government bond dealers and brokers.    The GAO, in consultation with the Fed, the Treasury and the SEC, is required by a law enacted last year to study whether access to brokers' electronic screens and trading services should be expanded. That report is due April 28.    Much of the trading in the huge U.S. government securities market is funneled through a handful of brokerage firms. These firms provide electronic trading screens showing prices at which major dealers are willing to trade with each other. Dealers turn to brokers because that enables them to trade anonymously and avoid tipping off competitors to their positions.    Traders often refer to the broker screens' prices as the &quot;inside market&quot; for government bonds, and many say this information is highly valuable. Thus, the issue of who should see the brokers' electronic pricing screens is a highly sensitive one in the bond business.    Most brokers now restrict access to their screens to the 40 large commercial banks and securities dealers that have been designated &quot;primary dealers&quot; by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, as well as another dozen or so firms that have applied to the Fed to join the group.    &quot;It is absolutely necessary to open this informational source to the entire market for greater effectiveness,&quot; contended Rodger D. Shay, executive vice president of U.S. League Investment Services Inc.    Mr. Shay, a former chairman of Merrill Lynch Governmnent Securities Inc., acknowledged that his views have changed sharply in recent years. &quot;When I was at Merrill, I had to argue for the status quo,&quot; he said. But after he left Merrill Lynch in 1981, &quot;I began to look at it objectively and realized that it would be much better to make price information accessible to anyone who wants it.&quot;    Mr. Shay said he is confident that greater access to bond price information is coming. Using a basketball analogy, he said: &quot;That looks to me like an easy layup.&quot; However, he and others who testified yesterday agreed that the issue of expanding trading services is much more complex.    Proposals to overhaul the present system &quot;would adversely affect the liquidity and efficiency of the government securities market and ultimately increase the costs of financing the federal debt,&quot; contended Ralph F. Peters, chairman of Discount Corp. of New York.    E. Craig Coats Jr., a managing director of Salomon Brothers Inc. and head of the Public Securities Association's Primary Dealers Committee, echoed this view. &quot;The system's structure has evolved over many years, and we would be taking a substantial and unwarranted risk if we tampered with it,&quot; he warned.    Nonsense, retorted officials of Lazard Freres andamp; Co. They charge that the present system amounts to a &quot;private club approach&quot; and an &quot;oligopoly&quot; that has reduced the depth and liquidity of the market and violates antitrust laws. Michael G. Stout, executive vice president of First Bank Systems Capital Markets Group in Minneapolis, argued that the current system is grossly unfair and &quot;is the equivalent of insider information.&quot;    Justice Department officials won't disclose details of their probe. Several Justice Department lawyers attended yesterday's hearing as observers. </TEXT></DOC>
