 THE IBM WAYandM;EnterpriseandM;Our dictionary tells us that the word means a business, venture, or industry.andO;The implication is that an enterprise covers a lot of territory.andP;  When wethink of enterprise-wide computing, we do, indeed, think of systems thatcover a lot of territory.andP;  These systems have unique requirements and uniquecapabilities.andM;There are some important aspects to enterprise-wide computing.andP;  The first,and probably the basis for successful implementation of wide-scaleinformation management, is connectivity.andP;  This means that all of the elementsof the corporate computing environment can communicate with each other.andO;Connectivity in this instance goes well beyond the wires of local and widearea networks.andP;  It refers to the clean interface between individual computerunits within the enterprise.andP;  This brings us to the second aspect of asuccessful enterprise system: Interface.andP;  There are two types of intefacethat concern us.andP;  The first is the connection between elements of thecomputing environment.andP;  The second is the connection between the user and thecomputer.andM;The user interface presents a significant challenge because not all users orusers' needs are created equal.andP;  So the interface must serve two diversemasters--consistency and individuality.andP;  It must be consistent in the way itaddresses the system.andP;  It must be individual in the ways it addresses theusers and their needs.andP;  The final aspect of an enterprice-wide system is datamanagement.andP;  If corporate data is the organization's biggest asset, themanagement of its is the most crucial task the organization faces.andM;IBM has developed the beginnings of a vert coherent scheme for addressing thedemands of an enterprise-wide computing environment.andP;  That scheme is calledSystems Application Architecture (SAA).andP;  What SAA is, in simplest terms, isan equalizer.andP;  The impression you get with SAA is that all externalinterfaces are created equal.andP;  Under the covers, SAA allows an amazingdiversity in interconnection and data management on a variety of platforms,using a variety of operating systems, and running a variety of applications.andO;SAA also allows for the wide variance in user interface needs by providing awide variety of ways for the user to communicate with his or her individualworkstation.andM;Data Management from theandM;Top DownandM;The usual way to view a corporation's data is from the perspective of theuser.andP;  That seems, on the surface, logical since it's the users who must makeuse of the resource.andP;  But when we analyze the computing environment in termsof data management from that perspective, we are really looking into the rongend of the telescope.andP;  The data itself seems a very long way away.andP;  It's hardto get a perspective on it.andM;If, however, you view the system from the perspective of the data, everythingbecomes clearer.andP;  The data is the constant.andP;  It's the users that vary.andP;  Why?andO;Simply because there is one set of data.andP;  There are many users.andP;  Each ofthose users has different needs and different views of the data in the use.andO;What SAA offers in this situation is the consistency and control necessay tomanage the data, and the flexibility for the users to take advantage of itthe way they need to in their daily work.andM;When we talk about a large corporate computing environment, we mean a hybridof mainframes, minis, and micros, both on networks and stand alone.andP;  IBM hasdeveloped a blueprint for cooperative processing that places data in definedlocations on machines with defined tasks and distributes it to users in awide spectrum of locations using a wide variety of machines, each withequally well defined tasks.andP;  Before we get into those platforms and whattheir contributions are to SAA and the corporate computing environment, let'sdigress into a bit of database theory.andM;RelationalandM;TechnologyandM;The IBM Contribution toandM;ConsistencyandM;For there to be order in data management, we need a consistent model forstoring and retrieving the data.andP;  If we maintain consistency in those twoareas, storage and retrieval, we can use a variety of systems and productswithout fear of data loss or pollution.andP;  We can be certain that we can accessour data when and where we need to.andM;From the IBM perspective, the consistent means of storage is the relationaldatabase and the consistent means of retrieval is the Structured QueryLanguage (SQL).andP;  The relational database is nothing new, even though the termis bandied about in the micro computer community with apparent disregard foraccuracy.andP;  The relatinal model for data storage is very specific.andP;  Withoutdelving into the technology and mathematics involved, suffice it to say thatmost microcomputer database are not relational.andP;  Why do we care?andM;The beauty of Codd's relational model for database management is that itprovides the consistency and portability required to distribute data widelyin an enterprise with the absolute certainty that the data is accessible.andO;Where the data physically resides, or on what platform it may be found makesno difference at all to the relational model, as long as the system conformsto the technology.andM;Thus, we can distribute data literally around the globe and a user in themiddle of Iowa can access it without knowing or caring where it lives.andM;The retrieval issue is next.andP;  Just conforming to the relational model is notenough.andP;  If we are to avoid computer anarchy, we must have a consistent wayof retrieving the data.andP;  That method is SQL.andP;  While it is true that SQL maybe used on systems that are not truly relational, you must remember that inso doing, you are only using the appearance of SQL.andP;  Let's put it anotherway.andM;You can create a syntax for a query language that says anything you want itto.andP;  That syntax might be the SQL syntax.andP;  That doesn't make it SQL.andP;  SQLgets its power from how it uses optimization techniques to extract data froma relational database, not from its syntax.andP;  Thus, in order to take fulladvantage of the distributed model, you must have both the SQL and therelational database.andM;The next issue is the distribution of tasks in a cooperative processingenvironment.andP;  We hear a lot about database server technology in themicrocomputer marketplace.andP;  Database server technology actually started withmainframes.andP;  The mainframe computer is the ultimate database server.andP;  Thatmeans that it is the server's (mainframe's) job to handle the data.andP;  It isthe workstation's job to handle the user interface and the application.andM;The server performs the database manipulations under instructions from theworkstation application and delivers the results to the user.andP;  It's reallythat simple on the surface.andP;  Below the surface, the server must handle anumber of issues as well as simply finding data.andP;  Most of these issues existonly because of the multi-user nature of enterprise computing.andM;The most important issue is data security.andP;  The server or mainframe must beable to provide data to those users and only those users who have the rightto view/use it.andP;  The next issue is concurrency control.andM;What that means, in simplest terms, is that multiple users of data don'tinterfere with each other resulting in lost or corrupted data.andP;  The nextissue is data integrity.andP;  That's a complex issue which addresses thetechnical aspects of the relational model.andP;  For our purposes, it merely meansthat data is unique and locatable.andP;  We wouldn't want to make a query of adatabase and not know with certainty that we are getting back the data weseek and not some corrupted duplicate of it.andP;  Finally, we need to addressdata recovery.andP;  This means that if a transaction is interrupted it can berecovered or backed out as appropriate.andP;  If a complete system failure occurs,we need to be able to recreate the necessary transactions and continue as ifnothing happened.andM;What is all this leading to?andP;  Simply this: For today's industrial strengthcomputing environment, basic file server databases on LANs with languagesthat look like SQL and call themselves relational are hopelessly inadequate.andO;Even the noble LAN with its high-powered relational micro DBMS is not enough.andO;They are the vanguard of databases at the micro end of the spectrum, to besure, but before there were micros there were mainframes.andP;  And for most largecorporations, that's where the corporate data lives.andP;  The need is for anenterprise wide system for using and managing that data, not just for a wayto remove it to smaller platforms.andP;  How can we do that?andP;  Enter SAA and theIBM family of data management products.andM;The Big GunsandM;An Integrated Approach toandM;Corporate ComputingandM;It's an increasing fact of computer life that all of the seriousmicrocomputer database management systems want to communicate with IBM's DB2database.andP;  They go to great lengths to be able to do that.andP;  But there may bea cleaner way than looking for a series of translations that eventually tearsDB2 data from the depths of its mainframe prison.andP;  Why not take advantage ofSAA?andP;  This is the consistency that allows users to deal with corporate dataseamlessly as long as it is on a system that is SAA compliant.andM;That, by the way, does not necessarily mean that only IBM products areappropriate.andP;  The new IBM approach to enterprise computing recognizes that itis a multi-vendor world.andP;  There are a number of database engines thatcommunicate from the LAN end and are SAA compliant.andP;  It also does not meanthat there is no place for the database server at the LAN.andP;  It simply meansthat the bulk of the corporation's data will reside on the big platforms andwill be managed by big platform database engines.andM;Remember that we commented earlier that the mainframe was, really, a bigdatabase server.andP;  Well, that brings us to an important point.andP;  DB2 and otherlarge data management products are really just half the solution.andP;  They arethe database engines.andP;  They sit on the servers.andP;  They manage the data.andP;  Atthe user end we have the applications.andP;  And the applications need tointegrate seamlessly with the engines in order to perform efficiently.andP;  Let'sexamine the engines.andM;IBM's family of database engines is designed to fit the platform andoperating system where the data resides.andP;  They are relational and broadlyconform to SAA.andP;  Thus, there is strict consistency in the way they managedata and present it to the enterprise for use by user front end applications.andM;There are four basic database engines in the IBM family of relationalproducts.andP;  They are DB2, SQL/DS, OS/400 Data Manager, and OS/2 EE DatabaseManager.andP;  Each of the four engines has access to a suite of applicationdevelopment tools appropriate to the platform and operating system underwhich they function.andP;  All of the engines use SQL as the query language.andP;  Andall of them will, over time, work together in a distributed enterprise-widecomputing environment to manage the organization's data wherever it resides.andM;DB2andM;DB2 is the database most often touted as the one you need to connect to ifyou want to talk to mainframes from a LAN.andP;  Actually, if your LAN applicationis SAA compliant, and if it has the proper interface to the database, you'llbe able to talk to any of the IBM relational engines.andP;  Of course, yournetwork hardware will need to be correctly interfaced to the databaseplatform as well.andP;  DB2's position in the database pecking order is on thebiggest System/370 platforms running under the MVS operating system.andP;  It isdesigned to handle massive amounts of data--up to 64 Gigabytes per table--andis supported by a large number of development tools.andM;SQL/DSandM;SQL/DS is the other large scale database engine for System/370 platforms.andO;One difference is that while running on the largest of S/370 configurations,SQL/DS is not limited to the high end of the spectrum.andP;  This versatilerelational engine is also a hot performer on the smaller 9370 hardware.andO;SQL/DS runs under either the VM or VSE operating systems and provides a richenvironment for application programming using such languages as COBOL,Fortran, C, PL/1 and Assembler.andP;  The query language is a superset of SAA SQLwhich developers can embed in the host language application.andM;SQL/DS has some other distinct advantages.andP;  It's an easy program to use,administer and to develop applications form.andP;  Its applications can be used toaccess other VM-SQL/DS data distributed throughout the enterprise.andP;  Itprovides extraordinary security for data in terms of both backup and recoveryand the ability to administer widely distributed VM-SQL/DS data.andP;  WithSQL/DS, a database administrator in one location can manage data on VM-SQL/DSthroughout the enterprise from a single, centralized location.andP;  Finally,SQL/DS can accept data both from relational databases and non-relationaldatabases using a conversion utility called Data Extract (DXT).andP;  In terms oflarge platform flexibility, SQL/DS is top drawer.andM;OS/400 DataandM;ManagementandM;Not all computers are mainframes or micros.andP;  Under some circumstances thereis a requirement for what IBM calls a midrange computer.andP;  The midrangeplatform is the AS/400.andP;  The AS/400 uses a unique operating system calledOS/400 which treats data, programs, and devices as objects which itmanipulates and isolates from the user much is the way some LANs isolatephysical volumes and their resident data from users using virtual (network)drives.andP;  Even though the OS/400 database manager is an SAA participant, itoperates much differently than its larger siblings.andP;  However, in true SAAfashion, these difference are transparent to the users.andM;OS/2 EEandM;OS/2 is the small platform database manager and uses the same basic approachas DB2 and SQL/DS.andP;  However, unlike all other IBM relational databases, OS/2EE also has to deal with local area network issues.andP;  There is a bit of adifferent set of requirements for communicating within the LAN environmentand communicating with the external world.andP;  OS/2 EE supports both.andP;  And, ofcourse, from the database perspective, all of the significant capabilities ofthe larger systems are here including SAA SQL and a rich development andsupport environment.andM;At the WorkstationandM;With each level of user comes a different interface requirement.andP;  PC usersinteract with their systems differently from the EDP user.andP;  Executives havedifferent needs than accountants.andP;  The shipping clerk needs a differentenvironment than the marketing rep.andP;  The thread that runs through all ofthese users in the data.andP;  The thing that makes them different is how they useit.andM;IBM has gone to great lengths to provide as rich a user environment as itsdata management environment.andP;  That means an executive who needs timelyinformation in a readable style can have decision support tools fed to him orher quickly and with very limited intervention.andP;  The shipping clerk who needsspecific, repetitive information has exactly what he or she needs and nothingelse.andP;  The accounting clerk who is performing repetitive transactions has thetools needed and so on.andP;  Each interface is appropriate for the user and thetask.andP;  Each development environment allows for the creation and support ofthose interfaces.andP;  The objective is for this diversity of interfaces tointeract throughout the enterprise consistently, providing predictableresults and operating cleanly with the corporate data which, itself, may beon a variety of platforms in several locations.andM;And that is the crux of IBM's SAA strategy.andP;  Like a successful government orcorporation, it provides unity in diversity.andP;  Depending upon a set ofunderlying standards, the SAA enterprise computing solution recognizes amultiuser, multi-platform, multi-operating system, multi-vendor society.andP;  Itmakes the implicit diversity in an enterprise manageable and efficient.andP;  Andit strives to combine the strengths of platforms of all sizes into a singleintegrated system which meets the needs of large scale corporate users atwhatever level they need to access the enterprise data.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
