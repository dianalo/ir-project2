Richard Gephardt embracing the Reagan administration's 1981 tax cuts as &quot;fair&quot; and seeking to isolate Gov. Michael Dukakis for opposing an oil-import fee sought by Southern producers.    The Missouri congressman found himself repeatedly pressed by his rivals in next week's Super Tuesday contests, and used last night's debate here as an occasion to sound -- more than ever -- the anti-tax and economic &quot;nationalism&quot; themes he hopes will appeal to working-class white voters in the South.    The Gephardt campaign began running television ads yesterday portraying the congressman's lead rivals, Massachusetts Gov. Dukakis and Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore, as supportive of higher taxes, and Mr. Gephardt has refined his stump speech to pair the two men as part of an elite &quot;Harvard&quot; establishment.    In exchanges with Sen. Gore, the congressman defended his support of the 1981 tax cuts and interjected a reminder to the television audience that his opponent was educated at an exclusive Washington prep school. &quot;I thought they taught you manners at St. Albans,&quot; Mr. Gephardt said.    When Gov. Dukakis protested that an oil-import fee risked serious damage to the Mexican economy, Mr. Gephardt retorted bluntly: &quot;Are you running for president of Mexico or of America?&quot;    Among the five presidential candidates present last night, Gov. Dukakis is alone in vigorously opposing an oil-import fee, and even more than in the running debate over trade policy, these exchanges about the oil fee pointed to a split between the two men.    &quot;If I'm president of the United States, I'm going to be sensitive to that relationship,&quot; the governor said, referring to the relationship between Mexico and the U.S. But Rep. Gephardt's comment could have a raw appeal in Texas, where the two men are close in public opinion polls.    The 1981 tax cuts also were popular in the South, but Rep. Gephardt's remarks contradict years of analysis by House Democratic leaders -- including himself -- that the across-the-board reductions disproportionately benefited wealthy families. The congressman insisted that two-thirds of the benefits went to families earning $50,000 and less, but in the early 1980s he was among those who criticized the same law as unfair for returning benefits to the wealthy.    Sen. Gore and Gov. Dukakis will probably try to exploit this contradiction, and despite his populist rhetoric, Mr. Gephardt found himself on the defensive last night for accepting large campaign contributions from corporate interests.    Former Sen. Gary Hart, who participated in the debate along with the Rev. Jesse Jackson, joined the fray on this point and portrayed the contributions of political action committees as the &quot;toxic waste&quot; of American politics. When Rep. Gephardt protested the implication that any candidate accepting such funds was unduly influenced, Mr. Hart responded that he &quot;hoped&quot; the congressman's votes hadn't been swayed.    Last night's debate, sponsored by the Democratic Leadership Council, was the last forum at which all the major contenders were to have met before Super Tuesday. Though most attention focused on the rivalry among Sen. Gore, Rep. Gephardt and Gov. Dukakis, Mr. Jackson is expected to carry several states next Tuesday. He bridled at a question suggesting that he had been treated easily by his white rivals. &quot;My race is self-evident,&quot; answered the black preacher. &quot;My leadership is obvious.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
