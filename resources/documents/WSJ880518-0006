GENERALE DES ETABLISSEMENTS MICHELIN said it will set up a joint industrial venture in Japan with OKAMOTO INDUSTRIES INC. in a move that will strengthen the French tire and rubber group's foothold in Japan.    Under terms of the accord, Michelin's Swiss financial subsidiary, Cie. Financiere Michelin, will put up 51% of the capital of the new unit, to be called Michelin Okamoto Tire Corp., and Okamoto will put up the remaining 49%. Financial details of the agreement weren't disclosed.    The venture plans to take over Okamoto's tire-making plant at Gunma, north of Tokyo, which currently produces about 12,000 tires daily. The plant's capacity will be doubled in 1990 to produce Michelin car tires using Michelin technology. Michelin will retain management control.    Michelin, which is jostling with Goodyear Tire andamp; Rubber Corp. of the U.S. to become the world's biggest tire manufacturer, already is the leading imported brand in Japan. Sales of Michelin car tires in Japan increased more than 70% in the past five years and are just over three million annually. Through its linkup with Okamoto, Michelin will double the number of its sales outlets to 1,400. </TEXT></DOC>
