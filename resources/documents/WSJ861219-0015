The government had initially selected AGF, a large insurance group, as one of the three companies to start the nation's denationalization drive. It was expected to be put on the market next March. But Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said yesterday that AGF will be denationalized in the second half of 1987 instead.    Havas, an advertising and communications group, Credit Commercial, a medium-sized commercial bank, and two smaller banks -- Banque du Batiment andamp; Travaux Publics and Banque Industrielle andamp; Mobiliere Privee -- will be denationalized in the first half of 1987, Mr. Balladur said in a radio interview.    The government decided to delay selling AGF because, company and state officials say, there is a problem in evaluating AGF's unrealized capital gains and deciding how to divide them among future shareholders and policyholders.    The government aims to make private by 1991 26 industrial, banking and insurance groups. Saint-Gobain S.A., a glass and pipe company, was returned to the private sector this month and the state intends to denationalize Cie. Financiere de Paribas, a banking group, next month. </TEXT></DOC>
