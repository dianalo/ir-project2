In early trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Stevens rose62{ cents to $66.62{ a share.   Odyssey had charged that a Pepperell merger with Stevens wouldviolate antitrust laws. But Pepperell said today it reachedagreement last Friday with the Federal Trade Commission on theterms of its offer, which include selling certain Stevens assets.   Pepperell has proposed selling half of Stevens' bath lines and20 percent of its sheet lines for about $170 million. The FTCapproved the definitive agreement for the sale Pepperell had signedwith NTC Group, parent of the textile manufacturer Bidd Co.

Analysts had predicted further bidding in the battle forStevens, which operates a number of state-of-the-art sheet andtowel plants.   The company also has licenses for lucrative designer labelsincluding Ralph Lauren, Laura Ashley, Pierre Cardin, Vanderbilt,Perry Ellis and Givenchy. Pepperell's brands include Arrow, Martex,Lady Pepperell and Burberrys.   Bidding for Stevens began after it received a leveraged buyoutoffer from a group led by its own senior management, includingChairman Whitney Stevens _ a fifth-generation member of the familythat founded the company in 1813.   The management group initially offered $43 a share and latersweetened its bid to $55 a share in cash and securities. In aleveraged buyout, a company is acquired largely with borrowed moneyrepaid with a target company's profits or the sale of assets.   Pepperell, of West Point, Ga., last month launched a$62.50-a-share tender offer after Stevens had reached an agreementwith Odyssey on a buyout at $61.50 a share.
