(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Residents of this town pledged today towhittle their waistlines and cut cholesterol as part of a two-year,$4 million study aimed at reducing heart disease among ruralAmericans.   ``This town is looking healthier already,'' said Mayor AnthonyCipriani during a ceremony marking the start of the fitness study.``I predict that in two years we will be living longer, healthierlives.''   After Cipriani's remarks, residents released thousands of red,white and blue heart-shaped balloons into threatening skies. A cardsigned by residents who promised to adopt a healthier lifestyle wasattached to each balloon.   ``I hope to quit smoking, I've been trying for 20 years,'' saidEsther Taylor, 40, one of those attending the ceremony. ``Oureating habits are really bad, too, too much junk food and meat andeggs.''   The program, one of the first privately funded public healtheducation programs for rural areas, is sponsored by The Bayer Co.and Glenbrook Laboratories, the aspirin maker's New York-basedparent.   Signs of a fitness frenzy are evident throughout the Ohio Rivertown. Exercise bicycles, tennis rackets and baseball gloves havereplaced dresses and men's clothing in the windows of some shops.   And a sign at Wade's Barbershop advertised free ``rest facials''today guaranteed to ``cleanse the skin, increase circulation,activate glandular activity and correct certain skin disorders.''   Some of the 1,000 volunteers in the study sampled low-caloriesnacks and had their weight and blood pressure checked Sundayduring a health fair that attracted most of the town's 4,000residents.   ``I'm looking forward to it, especially because of my husband'shigh cholesterol,'' said Donna Lyons, one of those in the study.``Right now, I'm smoking. But hopefully I can break that habit withthe help of the program and begin exercising regularly, too.''   Organizers said they chose Wellsburg, about 45 miles southwestof Pittsburgh, because of its small population. Also, West Virginiaregistered the highest obesity rate in the country at 24 percent ina 1986 federal study that found 31 percent of West Virginians smokecigarettes.   The state is second only to Iowa in the annual death rate fromheart disease, said Dr. David Heydinger, West Virginia's healthdirector.   Bayer hopes a fitter Wellsburg will be a model for other smalltowns.   Robin Mills, president of The Bayer Co., and actor JohnForsythe, who portrays Blake Carrington in television's``Dynasty,'' joined Cipriani in Sunday's one-mile trek around thetown square.   ``There's nothing symbolic about this,'' Forsythe said as hestepped out in a quick stride to the strains of ``When The SaintsGo Marching In'' played by the dozen elderly women who make up theRambling Rose Kazoo Band.   ``I just want people to hear the facts from a guy who actuallywent through it.''   The 70-year-old actor underwent heart bypass surgery in 1979 andnow follows a strict diet that includes fish, chicken and low-fatfoods, but no red meat.   ``The enthusiasm has been building all week,'' said BrianMorris, coordinator of the ``wellness program.'' ``We have morethan 200 people on a wait-list who will take the place of anyonedropping out before the study is completed.''   Initial testing for the program ended today, and results ofcomprehensive health exams that checked for high blood pressure,high cholesterol, obesity and other cardiovascular risk factorswere tallied.   The tests will be repeated every three months during the study.   Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the UnitedStates, accounting for more deaths annually than all other causescombined, according to the American Heart Association.</TEXT></DOC>
