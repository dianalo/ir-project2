So far as is known, the Swedes are the first in Western Europeto modify their refugee policy to adjust for glasnost, Sovietleader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of openness.   The Swedish Immigration Board has issued deportation ordersagainst 10 Soviets asking to stay. The board held that they did notqualify as political refugees and that the risk has diminished theywill be punished if they return home.   Until last spring, asylum requests were routinely granted, onthe assumption that anyone who was sent back could be prosecutedfor anti-Soviet behavior.   But now ``the legal environment has changed'' in the SovietUnion, said Bjorn Westin, an Immigration Board official, and Swedennow will judge each case on its merits.   All 10 of the Soviets ordered deported have appealed and arestill in Sweden. While the 10 were turned down the ImmigrationBoard approved about 80 other applications, officials said.   Westin said those who were refused ``are not refugees. We don'tturn away refugees.''   He added that the board, after checking each case with theSwedish embassy in Moscow, was convinced that none would facereprisals.   ``If that had been the case, we wouldn't turn them back.''   Sweden, which has one of the most liberal refugee policies inEurope, gets more requests for asylum from Soviets than any othercountry on the continent.   Defectors often leave the Soviet Union with legal visas, thenrefuse to go back when their visas expire. Others reach the Westafter dramatic escapes. Last year a farm hand flew a crop dusterairplane across the Baltic Sea and crashed near Sweden's Gotlandisland.   Among 18,000 or so people granted asylum in Sweden last year, 73came from the Soviet Union, while other countries in Western Europeaccepted fewer than 10 Soviets each.   The number of Soviets asking to stay in Sweden was expected toreach 120 by the end of this year, partly because Sovietauthorities were allowing more people to travel abroad and wereless careful to make sure they intended to come back, officialssaid.   Officials questioned in Spain, Greece, Italy, Denmark andSwitzerland said the rules for Soviet citizens are no differentfrom for any other country and have not changed in view of glasnost.   ``Of course overall developments in the Soviet Union play arole, but we wouldn't go so far as to say that due to glasnost andperestroika (restructuring) the problem has been solved,'' saidHeinz Schoeni, spokesman for Switzerland's refugee commissioner inGeneva.   Finland, which is the only non-communist country to share a longland border with the Soviet Union and has a ``friendship pact''with the Kremlin, has handled the question of Soviet defectorsdelicately and usually in secret. Many reportedly have been turnedaway or quietly told to take the next ferry to Sweden.   Sweden's decision to scrutinize Soviet asylum seekers morecarefully has caused consternation among Soviet emigres, who saythey have less faith than the Swedish government in Soviet pledgesof human rights reforms.   Ulo Ignatz, editor of an Estonian-language newspaper publishedin Stockholm, said that those who return to the Soviet Union maynot be imprisoned as before but may find their careers blocked orface other forms of harassment.   ``The legislation has not been changed,'' Juris Kaza, aStockholm-based freelance journalist specializing in the BalticStates, said of the Soviet pledges on human rights.   ``The statute against anti-Soviet activity is still on thebooks. It's an arbitrary decision not to prosecute,'' he said.   Sweden's move also caught human rights groups by surprise.   ``It's quite a new problem for us,'' said Jan Bolling, of theSwedish branch of the London-based Amnesty International.   ``We can't say that from our point of view asylum seekers faceless of a risk today. We have no such information.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Mon PMs Nov. 7</NOTE></DOC>
