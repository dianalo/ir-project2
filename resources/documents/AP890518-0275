Kingon, the U.S. representative to the 12-nationCommon Market.   Kingon, who leaves his post June 3 after more than two years,told reporters he generally was optimistic about trade relationsbetween the United States and the Common Market.   ``There has been an effort especially in the last 12 months totry to put the tiffs that we have...into some kind ofperspective...and not let (them) unhinge the whole relationship,''he said.   Kingon noted, however, that the two sides have not settled afight over a European ban on imports of American beef from cattletreated with growth hormones. They also are at odds over governmentsupport for Airbus Industrie, a four-nation European aircraftbuilding consortium that competes with Boeing Co. and McDonnellDouglas Corp.   But he said the most troublesome dispute concerned efforts toreach agreement on the politically sensitive issue of governmentsubsidies to farmers.   The United States, the Common Market and other countries aretackling agricultural policies as part of international trade talksheld under the auspices of the 96-nation General Agreement onTariffs and Trade. GATT is a forum and an agreement for removingtrade barriers.   Kingon said that if the United States and the Common Market donot resolve their differences, ``then I must say I'm pessimisticabout what will happen to the trade relations between the twogroups.''   The two sides agreed last month to freeze current farm supportlevels and reduce aid in 1990. The accord provides a framework forfurther discussions under the Uruguay Round of talks to liberalizeglobal trade. The round ends in 1990.   The United States wants the European Community to end importbarriers and export and domestic farm subsidies that it saysdistort trade.   Kingon also predicted the European Community's openness toforeign goods after it becomes a single market in 1992 will dependon competition within the trade bloc and on world economicconditions.   Once the barriers are dismantled, he said, European businessexecutives will find their companies facing strong competition fromother European concerns. These tougher business conditions, hesaid, may take place during a period of economic recession.   ``The convergence of those two forces will put to the test theoften-stated, well-intentioned expression...that this will be anopen market,'' he said.   American and other foreign officials and business executivesworry the Europeans may use the single market to try to keep outU.S. and other foreign competition.   The European-wide market is intended reduce barriers that keepgoods, services, people and money from moving freely among the 12countries.</TEXT></DOC>
