Koch said Monday that the Rev.Jesse Jackson was stealing the spotlight at the Democraticconvention from Michael Dukakis and urged that the party unite towin the White House.   ``We ought to get together, no demands. Let the guy run forpresident,'' Koch said in an interview with reporters at City Hall.   Jackson has been demanding ``full partnership'' with Dukakis inthe upcoming campaign.   Koch said, ``I happen to think the largest number of peoplerespond to the quarterback. The quarterback in this case isDukakis. He represents, reflects the mainstream Democraticpolitics.''   The mayor said, ``I think it is a huge error on the part ofwhose who are seeking to diminish the Dukakis role by makingdemands upon him which he can't respond to.''   Koch is not going to the convention. He said that if Dukakis hadasked him to be a delegate he would have. Instead, he is going toIreland on a pilgrimage for peace in Northern Ireland with CardinalJohn O'Connor.   During the New York primary this spring, Koch backed TennesseeSen. Al Gore over Dukakis and attacked Jackson, saying that Jewswho support Israel would be ``crazy'' to vote for him because ofhis pro-Palestinian positions.</TEXT></DOC>
