According to the official Libyan news agency JANA, monitoredhere, Libya called for a urgent conference of the OPEC MinisterialCouncil as soon as possible.   It said the council should ``take the necessary measures to stopthe fall in prices, restore stability to the oil market and to takeprices up to levels which are fair to both consumer and producer.''   Oil prices tumbled last week to their lowest levels since 1986,and now are just under $13 a barrel in the U.S. futures market.   Some analysts blamed the sharp decline on indications that moreSaudi Arabian crude will be flowing into the market. The Saudishave indicated they may hike production unless other members of the13-nation OPEC adhere to production quotas aimed at supporting abenchmark price of $18 a barrel.   JANA said Libya's decision to call for the extraordinary meetingwas made ``after consultation with some OPEC member countries.''</TEXT></DOC>
