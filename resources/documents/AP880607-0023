JesseJackson bought half an hour of television time to make a liveprimary-eve appeal for votes in California, but got caught intraffic and missed half of the show.   Vice President George Bush, who wrapped up the Republicannomination weeks ago, said in California that he expects to findhimself differing increasingly with administration policy as thecampaign goes on.   ``We'll probably be dragged into more and more of these thingsrather than less,'' he said at a news conference where he was askedabout one such difference, his advocacy of a delay in an offshoreoil lease.   The oil-lease issue became moot Monday night, however, whenInterior Secretary Donald Hodel abruptly suspended plans to proceedwith a controversial drilling project off Northern California.   Hodel's primary-eve move followed Bush's call for a delay in theproject. Both Dukakis and Jackson oppose the offshore drilling, andthe issue has been an important one in environmentally sensitiveCalifornia.   Jackson, meanwhile, spent a busy last day of campaigning beforethe election _ so busy that he got tied up in traffic and arrived 16minutes late for a half-hour live broadcast that was supposed to bea dramatic final appeal for votes. The television time for the show,broadcast throughout the state, cost $150,000.   Rock disc jockey Casey Kasem, a Jackson supporter, filled thetime while waiting for Jackson with an interview with a Jacksoncampaign official and video montages.   Jackson said after the show he planned a meeting with Dukakislate Monday night at Jackson's hotel.   Dukakis' aides have confidently predicted for weeks their manwould amass the 2,081 delegates needed for the nomination by thetime the primaries ended. And with one day remaining until then,they were leaving nothing to chance.   The Massachusetts governor picked up more than 70 delegatesduring the day, increasing his total to 1,874. That left less than200 short of the total needed, and aides said he would pick up thatmany and more from the 466 at stake in primaries in California, NewJersey, Montana and New Mexico.   Dukakis was also preparing to pick up endorsements on Wednesdayfrom former rivals Rep. Richard Gephardt and Sen. Paul Simon,campaign sources said. Dukakis was to stop off in Gephardt's homestate of Missouri to formally receive the congressman's backing. AndSimon was to make an endorsement statement in Washington, withoutDukakis present, the sources said.   ``This has been a great 15 months. I'm excited about whathappened and I'm looking forward, if all goes well, to a decisivevictory ... so we can lock up the nomination,'' Dukakis said as hecampaigned in California.   An ABC News tracking poll released Monday night suggested Dukakishad a 2-1 lead over Jackson in California. The survey indicated hehad the of 61 percent of those surveyed, to 30 percent for Jackson.   The figures, from sampling of 415 voters done over the weekend,represented a slight gain for Dukakis. The poll's margin of errorwas 6 percentage points.   More than 40 of Dukakis' fresh delegates came from Kentucky,where Gov. Wallace Wilkinson led the way. Wilkinson and many otherdelegates there had been supporting drop-out candidate Albert GoreJr.   Jackson still spoke of chances for a California upset as he madethe final rounds of his campaign and arranged a 30-minute paidtelevised appeal in several of the state's large cities. But histalked turned increasingly to the pre-convention bargaining thatlies ahead.   He said he would push Dukakis to stop moving ``cautiously andconservatively'' and to use the party platoform to take a strongerstand against South Africa. ``If he will not bend on that matter,we'll simply meet each other on the floor'' at the DemocraticNational Convention in Atlanta, he said.   Jackson, who finished first or second in dozens of primaries andcaucuses, said he wanted changes in party rules, as well,particularly those dealing with selection of delegates in futurecampaigns.   In all he said, however, Jackson also was careful to add, ``Wecan resolve our differences within the contest of our party and notin the streets, and that's growth.''   He said, ``I intend to keep building our party, keep expandingparticipation, keep registering voters, keep encouraging people tobe involved.''   Dukakis sounded anything but upset at Jackson's talk.   ``I know how strongly he feels about the importance of a Democratin the White House next January,'' he said.   Of Jackson's position on South Africa, the governor said: ``Idon't think it's going to be a problem...I'm for tougher sanctions.I hope it's going to be in our platform, and I don't see where thisis going to be a division in our party or our country.''   Dukakis, the Democratic front-runner also jabbed at Bush on thesubject of off-shore oil drilling. The vice president, staking out adifference with Reagan administration policy, said on Sunday hefavors a delay in a controversal drilling project off the coast ofnorthern California.   Said Dukakis: ``I'm pleased he's coming around, but it's kind oflate. I'm not for delaying that sale. I'm for canceling it.''   Bush told a Republican audience in California on Monday nightthat he has major differences with Dukakis on a range of issues.   He criticized the Massachusetts governor for failing to supportthe death penalty for big-time drug traffickers, over aprisoner-furlough program in Massachusetts and on arms controlmatters.   Pointing to the recent U.S.-Soviet INF treaty, the vice presidentsaid: ``If we'd listened to Dukakis and Jackson, we wouldn't havemade any progress at all.''</TEXT></DOC>
