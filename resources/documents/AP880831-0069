Nearly 1,000 South African soldiers, who supported Angola'santi-Marxist guerrillas, crossed into South-West Africa on Tuesday,said Lt. Gen. Ian Gleeson, South Africa's army chief of staff.   The withdrawal completed the first phase of a U.S.-mediatedcease-fire and peace plan aimed at ending the civil war in Angola _whose Marxist government is backed by thousands of Cuban troops _and granting independence to South-West Africa, which is controlledby South Africa.   ``As of this moment, we are out of Angola,'' Gleeson said at aceremony in this town on the Angolan border. He said there had beenno truce violations.   South African and foreign journalists were flown to Rundu towitness the pullout of the last South African forces.   South Africa says it will grant independence to South-WestAfrica, also known as Namibia, after Cuba withdraws its troops fromAngola. The Cubans reportedly have offered to leave Angola in 24months.   An estimated 2,500 South African troops have gradually retreatedto Namibia after a cease-fire was declared Aug. 8. The troopssupported the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola,or UNITA, which controls about one-third of the country.   The United States mediated peace talks and a cease-fire amongAngola, Cuba and South Africa. UNITA, also backed by the UnitedStates, is not a party to the agreement.   The four countries involved in the negotiations met last week inBrazzaville, Congo, but failed to set timetables for withdrawal ofthe estimated 50,000 Cuban troops in Angola and for Namibianindependence. Another round of talks is planned next week inBrazzaville.   Cuban and Angolan officers serving on a cease-fire monitoringcommittee watched as soldiers dismantled the bridge across theOkavango River while villagers washed their clothes nearby.   The South African trucks crossing into Rundu carried troops andsupplies, and some towed giant G-5 long-range cannons across theshallow river.   Many of the vehicles had graffiti scrawled on them, such as ``Noretreat, no surrender'' and ``Hello, mom.'' The troops were greetedby a banner that read, ``Welcome, winners.''   Gleeson said South Africa will not conduct any more raids intoAngola in pursuit of guerrillas of the South-West African People'sOrganization. He said SWAPO, which has been fighting to end SouthAfrican rule over South-West Africa, said it will observe acease-fire starting Sept. 1.   South Africa has intervened in Angola regularly since 1975, whenit invaded the country on the eve of Angolan independence fromPortugal. South African army officers said their maximum strengthin Angola was 3,000 men, although other reports claimed the forcewas twice that size during battles in October.</TEXT></DOC>
