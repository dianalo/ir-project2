Five soldiers were injured in the raid, which came during aheavy downpour said the official, who spoke on condition ofanonymity.   At least 100 militants attacked the Panagoda army garrison 12miles southeast of Colombo with grenades and automatic weapons, hesaid. The garrison usually holds between 10,000 and 15,000 soldiers.   It was the biggest raid on an army post by militants since theylaunched a bloody campaign to protest government peace overtures toTamil rebels, who are fighting for a separate homeland, theofficial said.   The Sinhalese militants, who belong to the left-wing People'sLiberation Front, said a 1987 India-backed peace accord giving theTamil minority limited autonomy made too many concessions. Theybegan killing government officials and ruling party members.   India sponsored the accord, sending troops to northern andeastern Sri Lanka, because of the sympathies of its own 60 millionTamils to the rebel cause.   Indian Foreign Secretary Shailendra Kumar Singh met Tuesday withPresident Ranasinghe Premadasa to discuss the withdrawal of Indianpeacekeeping troops.   Sri Lankan officials were to meet Wednesday with Tamil rebelleaders for talks on ending their 6-year-old separatist war.   The campaign for a Tamil nation has claimed 10,000 lives.Sinhalese militants have been blamed for more than 3,000 killingssince January.   The militants have attacked army camps and police stations toget weapons. The military official said the attackers of thePanagoda garrison penetrated the camp's perimeter and came withinyards of its armory before being beaten back.   Army soldiers searched rice paddies and jungles near the campfor the militants, he said.   Sinhalese, who are mostly Buddhists, form 75 percent of SriLanka's 18 million people. They control the government and themilitary.   Tamils, predominantly Hindus, make up 18 percent of thepopulation and allege discrimination in jobs and education by theSinhalese.</TEXT></DOC>
