Yuval shifts the rifle in his lap and scans the scene with a sentry's eye.    Although it is bitterly cold on the roof of the hilltop barracks, the 20-year-old Israeli sergeant welcomes this duty. &quot;Guarding is a very honorable thing,&quot; he says. &quot;Because I am up here doing my job, my friends can rest easy in their rooms.&quot; Few of his other duties, on patrol amid rock-throwing Palestinians, have been anywhere near as clear-cut.    A few miles away, a 16-year-old named Riyad also spends his afternoons on watch. Perched on a pile of rubble near the main road to Hebron, he cradles a lump of concrete and eyes the license plates of passing cars. Blue plates belong to fellow West Bank Palestinians and aren't of any interest. But as a Fiat with yellow Israeli plates approaches, Riyad winds up like a pitcher and lobs his missile at its windshield. The concrete chunk falls just short, shattering on the roadway. He shrugs. &quot;It hasn't been a good day for me,&quot; he says. &quot;I've hardly damaged any cars.&quot;    Until eight weeks ago, Yuval, the soldier, had never set foot on the West Bank. Born in a small town near Tel Aviv, he is a second-generation Israeli whose grandparents migrated from Germany in 1913. Riyad has been here all his life, born, like his father, in the squalid West Bank camp where his grandparents wound up after fleeing their home in the 1948 war.    Arab and Jew, refugee and occupier, Riyad and Yuval have become the target of each other's rocks and rubber bullets since the occupied territories erupted in violence in early December. But while the young Israeli soldier seems depressed by that predicament, disturbed by the moral dilemmas of his duties, the Palestinian youth is buoyant: exhilarated and passionate about his protest. What follows is a look at two very different figures trapped together in a troubled landscape.    The Israeli Soldier   Yuval trudges heavily up the muddy barracks steps, returning from three days' leave on his girlfriend's kibbutz. &quot;Coming back, you're always very depressed for the first day or two,&quot; he says. &quot;Then you get used to it again.&quot;    What he must get used to is a daily patrol that begins between 4 and 5 a.m. and can last 12 hours. Pacing the narrow alleys of troubled Arab villages is worse than facing a rioting crowd, he says, because &quot;you never know where the rocks are going to come from. There might be someone on the roof that you can't see.&quot;    The Israeli army allowed Yuval to be interviewed on condition that his last name not be disclosed and neither troop details nor party politics be discussed. While the army selected the company to be visited, it didn't nominate a particular soldier.    Yuval's parents, both artists, are working in Germany. He spent several years with them before returning to Israel alone and joining a kibbutz in the Golan Heights.    Yuval tended apple orchards for a time before beginning his military service about a year ago. He volunteered for a combat unit and trained as a paratrooper. &quot;If there is a war, I want to be on the border, to protect my country,&quot; he says. &quot;But what I'm doing here isn't what I'm trained for.&quot;    His training was interrupted by the disturbances in the occupied territories. In his view, violence has been escalating since then, with the Israeli policy of mass arrests and beatings only worsening the situation.    At first, he says, only small boys were throwing stones. Now he sees whole families of children who have been beaten or jailed becoming involved -- &quot;people who two months ago wanted to live in peace with us,&quot; he thinks.    The gaunt young soldier runs a hand through cropped brown hair. &quot;The army can't give a solution,&quot; he says. &quot;We can only try to keep down the numbers killed until the politicians find an answer.&quot; The country will eventually face major outbreaks of terrorism if they don't, he fears.    The barracks Yuval is guarding is a grim place, with dirty cream-colored paint peeling from the walls and glassless windows taped over with plastic. Though usually housing only a handful of troops, it now is packed. The company has a movie projector but only one film -- &quot;Mad Max III.&quot; Everybody has seen it at least five times.    For Yuval, the past two months have led to intense self-examination about what he is prepared to do in the line of duty. He has used rubber bullets and contends that their dangers are sometimes overstated in the news media. But he has been appalled, he says, by the beatings many soldiers have inflicted under orders. &quot;It's not easy to beat someone,&quot; he says. &quot;You're standing in front of a person, you see his face -- I personally am unable to do it.&quot;    As a Jew who has lived in Germany, he is acutely aware of the issue of when to obey orders. Not all share his sensitivity. He says he has had to stop his own friends when he felt their use of force was unwarranted. In the barracks, heated arguments have sometimes erupted.    But whatever his reservations, Yuval has a steely defensiveness about his country and is untroubled by international opprobrium. &quot;I don't give a damn about what Americans are thinking,&quot; he says, &quot;because I don't believe American soldiers will come to help us if our existence is threatened. If we've learned anything in thousands of years of Jewish history, it's that we have to be responsible for our own security.&quot;    Yuval's sentry duty is interrupted by the static of a radio call. The afternoon patrol is returning, and its leader asks Yuval to prepare the table for a meal. Before leaving the rooftop to lay out fried fish and cheese blintzes, he stares for a long moment at the rows of Arab terraces marching up the Hebron hills.    Until he came to the West Bank, Yuval had never had a real conversation with a Palestinian or been inside an Arab home. He has found the forced contact intriguing. His family isn't particularly religious, and he has been fascinated by the power of the mosques in Arab villages. And with just one sibling, he has been struck by the contrast between his own small, far-flung family and the large, close-knit Arab households.    Now, he says, he finds it impossible to hate his enemy. &quot;I try to understand them,&quot; he says. &quot;They want their country, and they don't have it. I wish there was a solution for both of us.&quot; But he is pessimistic. &quot;I think we will never have peace with the Syrians, with the other Arab countries.&quot; And with the Palestinians?    &quot;Well,&quot; he says with a shrug, &quot;I hope.&quot;    The Palestinian   At the wail of an approaching siren, Riyad drops his stone and signals to his companions to scatter. There are only four of them, too few to confront a truckload of troops. Wrapping his red-and-white kaffiyeh around his face as protection against informers in the refugee camp, he speeds off through the winding back streets toward his home.    This reporter met Riyad after he had stoned her car. At first, the impassioned teen-ager refused to talk. &quot;I'm too busy now,&quot; he said, sending a stone slamming into the side of an Israeli truck. &quot;And if I start on this subject, I'll never stop.&quot; But in the lull provided by the troops' arrival, he agreed to an interview.    Riyad's home is a four-room concrete hovel that houses 18 people. Steel reinforcing bars protrude from the walls, and rain drips onto the kitchen floor through holes in the corrugated-metal roof. On a wet day, with schools disrupted because of the unrest, stepping inside is like walking into a day-care center. All 13 of Riyad's younger brothers and sisters are crowded into one room. His grandmother and his father's two wives feed the brood a lunch of rice-stuffed vine leaves.    Riyad's father, who is only 33, is at work as a bricklayer on a Jerusalem building site. There is tension between father and son. &quot;He can't excuse me to go and throw stones,&quot; Riyad says. For his part, the boy can barely excuse his father's dependence on Jewish employers, although he blames the Israelis for the poverty that makes it necessary.    His father speaks fluent Hebrew, but Riyad refuses to learn. &quot;I don't like to talk to Jews,&quot; he says. &quot;They are my enemies.&quot; Riyad dreams of becoming a doctor but fears the pressure to earn wages will cut short his studies. &quot;Look at all these mouths to feed,&quot; he says, tousling the hair of the toddlers who cluster around him.    Even in winter a stench rises from the open gutters that drain the camp. In this fetid, crowded place, Riyad dreams of his family's lost land. &quot;My grandmother had flocks of sheep, olive groves. Everything you can think of, she had,&quot; he says. He has never seen the farm, though. It now is the site of an Israeli town.    Riyad's political education began in school, where his favorite teacher ardently supports the Palestine Liberation Organization, and continued in an Israeli prison, where he served two months a year ago for stoning an Israeli bus. &quot;I was a little bit afraid when they took me to prison,&quot; he says, &quot;but the second time I won't be, because I know what to expect now.&quot; He says he made good friends in jail and was hailed as a hero when he returned.    Riyad barely looks 16, a wispy attempt at a mustache only emphasizing his boyishness. Nevertheless, this is the face of a leader. He is clearly in command of his small band of stone-throwers, and he describes how he rounds up sometimes-reluctant youths when he feels it is time for a protest.    &quot;If only the other Arab countries would help us, give us guns, we would be able to do so much more,&quot; he complains. He is particularly disparaging about King Hussein, the Jordanian monarch. &quot;He killed Palestinians in Black September,&quot; he says, referring to the king's eviction of Palestinians from Jordan 18 years ago. &quot;Now he says he wants to help us. He lies, and I would say that to his face. If he comes here, I would try to kill him.&quot;    When Riyad is asked if he thinks peace will ever be possible, his English falters. &quot;What is the meaning of this word 'peace'?&quot; The reporter tries the Arabic word, and Riyad replies that yes, the people of the camp want peace.    But his father's second wife, who has been silently cradling a baby, suddenly breaks in with a different answer.    &quot;La salaam,&quot; she shouts. &quot;No peace. The people of this camp want war.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
