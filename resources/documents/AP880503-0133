The Army has temporarily shelved its proposal to construct thefacility at Dugway Proving Grounds but plans to seek the moneyagain next year, the officials testified to a trio of Housesubcommittees.   They said the United States has unilaterally renounced any useof biological weapons but still needs to conduct research in thefield because of germ weapons that might be developed by nationslike the Soviet Union.   ``We certainly have the responsibility to the soldier to protecthim and her against those who would use biological weapons,'' saidThomas Welch, deputy assistant secretary of defense. ``We mustprovide the masks, detectors, vaccines, and so on ... ''   The controversy involves Army plans to build a $5.4 million labwhich would have a ``bio-safety level four (B-4),'' the higheststandard of protection.   Rep. Wayne Owens, D-Utah, who represents the area, noted thatthe lab would have the capability ``to convert these lethalpathogens into aerosol form.''   ``And it is this dangerous aerosol capability that is settingoff alarm bells throughout the scientific community, bothinternationally and in Utah, as to the public safety and wisdom ofbuilding the Dugway facility,'' Owens said.   Officially, the United States shut down its biological weaponsprogram, which was based at Fort Detrick, Md., in 1969 andannounced that future research in the field would be limited to``defensive'' purposes.   The United States is also a party to a 1972 treaty banningpossession of biological weapons, but the pact lacks enforcement orverification provisions.   Welch and other administration officials repeatedly emphasizedTuesday that the Army's research program was only defensive and theUnited States would not use germ weapons.   ``It would be impossible for us to use biological weaponsbecause we don't have them,'' said Welch. ``We would never usebiological weapons against anybody.''   But legislators questioned Welch closely about the Army researchprogram. Rep. Dante Fascell, D-Fla., noted that ``the line betweenoffensive and defensive biological agents seems fuzzy at best.''   Welch noted that while the lab would be constructed to a B-4standard, the Army's planned experiments could be done in a B-3lab. The higher safety level is sought as a public protection, hesaid.   Army Col. Walter Busby, who oversees the testing program, saidthere are ``no plans to use genetically engineered material'' inthe Dugway facility.   Some of the biological agents tested at Dugway are shippedthrough regular mails, officials said.   Lynn Hansen, assistant director of the Arms Control andDisarmament Agency, said the Soviet Union has ``an active researchprogram'' to build germ weapons.   ``In contrast to the openness we have practiced regarding ourmilitary programs, the Soviets, to date, have never officiallyacknowledged even having a biological weapons program,'' Hansensaid.   Welch also said the U.S. program is open to inspection. But someparts of it remain secret because ``we do not want to expose ourvulnerabilities in any area,'' he said.   The officials testified at a joint hearing of the House ForeignAffairs arms control subcommittee, the Interior subcommittee onenergy and the environment, and the Armed Services subcommittee onmilitary installations and facilities.</TEXT></DOC>
