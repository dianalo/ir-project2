Fujita Corp. said one well that it drilled a year ago in Oita onKyushu had been proved to be the largest producer of steam and hotwater in the world, issuing 120 tons of steam and 100 tons of hotwater an hour, enough to produce 20 megawatts of electricity.   Spokesman Hitoshi Miyagishima said Fujita was digging severalmore wells in the geothermal field and had a plan to build 30 wellsto produce 250 megawatts of electricity with an investment of $1.2billion.   But he said Fujita had not approached the local utility aboutbuilding the plant, nor had it asked the national government forfinancial aid.   If the field is fully developed, it would more than double thecurrent national total of 215 megawatts of electricity fromgeothermal sources, Fujita said. Press reports said Japan stillwould trail the United States because one field there has agenerating capacity of 1,900 megawatts.   Japan, despite its many volcanos and hot springs, has not devotedmuch effort to exploring geothermal energy until recently. Its maindrive has been into nuclear reactors, which supplied 29 percent ofthe country's electricity in 1987. The government has approved aplan to double the output of nuclear power plants by the year 2000.A nuclear reactor usually produces more than 1,000 megawatts ofelectricity, or more than four times the output of the projectedgeothermal field in Kyushu.</TEXT></DOC>
