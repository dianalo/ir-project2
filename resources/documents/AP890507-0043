The House and Senate each signed off on a pair of spending plansThursday. No surprise there: The documents reflected deals honedlast month between Bush administration officials and congressionalleaders, and the chambers' votes were little more than exercises inrubber stamping.   Negotiators from the two houses plan to meet this week to workout a compromise budget. That job, too, is expected to besweat-free, because the two measures differ only slightly in howthey would distribute money among science, housing and otherdomestic programs.   There are three major landmarks lying ahead, however, wherejolting crunches could occur.   First up is additional revenues, which are supposed to accountfor about half of the $28 billion in deficit reduction in thepackage.   The budget says $5.3 billion is to come from increased taxreceipts. President Bush has claimed the budget allows him to honorhis campaign mantra of ``no new taxes,'' but strictly speaking thathas yet to be decided.   Bush says $4.8 billion of the amount can be raised by loweringthe capital gains tax. His argument it that such a cut will sparkthe economy and thus boost the government's overall tax take.   Democrats largely oppose Bush's idea, calling it a boon for thewealthy. Ominously, Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., of the HouseWays and Means Committee, which writes tax legislation, calls theplan ``unpalatable.''   The result: gridlock.   ``Where are they going to deliver from?'' asks Peter J. Davis,vice president of Prudential-Bache Securities, who monitors budgetactivity.   An additional $5.7 billion is supposed to come from sales ofgovernment assets, and $2.7 billion more is slated to be raised byincreasing fees for certain federal services. Congress has rejectedsome of these before, and could do so again.   The second hurdle is the question of fiscal 1991. It doesn'tbegin until Oct. 1, 1990, but lawmakers and Bush have promised totry to complete a budget pact for that year over the next fewmonths. An early deal gives Bush a feather in his cap, and helpslegislators avoid imposing pain _ in the form of any resultingtaxes or spending cuts _ on their constituents during an electionyear.   This may not be easy. The Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction lawrequires a 1991 shortfall of no more than $64 billion _ formidableconsidering this year's red ink should reach about $160 billion.   Many lawmakers say slashes of that magnitude will require lotsof give on both sides: an acceptance of taxes by Bush and ofdomestic program cuts by Democrats.   Opinions vary on whether that will occur, or whether the resultwill be a conglomeration of bookkeeping tricks, one-time windfallslike asset sales, and heavy reliance on rosy economic projectionsthat make the deficit look smaller.   ``Next year, senators on both sides of the aisle will bedemanding more deficit reduction than we had this year,'' predictsSen. Jim Sasser, D-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Budget Committee.   ``I don't know how we get around it next year, but mark mywords, we will,'' counters Sen. J. Bennett Johnston, D-La., amember of the budget panel.   Hurdle No. 3 comes Aug. 15, when the White House's Office ofManagement and Budget is required to update its projection of thecoming year's deficit with fresh economic figures. Under theGramm-Rudman law, should OMB determine that the shortfall willexceed the 1990 target of $110 billion, a process begins that couldresult in sweeping, politically unpalatable spending cuts.   Most budget-watchers doubt OMB would upset things by decidingthat things are off course.   `The general assumption is that when the administration andCongress came up with their agreement, implicit was that OMBwouldn't change the numbers very much'' in August, says StanleyCollender, who watches budget action for the Price Waterhouseaccounting firm.</TEXT></DOC>
