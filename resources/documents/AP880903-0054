(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A vaccine that blocks strep throat andrheumatic fever has been successful with laboratory animals and maybe ready for human tests in six months, a medical researcher says.   The vaccine is made through genetic engineering, by attachinggenes from streptococcal bacteria to a form of salmonella bacteriarendered harmless in the laboratory.   Edwin Beachey, a microbiology professor at the University ofTennessee-Memphis, says mice given the vaccine withstood doses ofstrep that were thousands of times greater than needed to triggeran infection.   He said Friday he is applying to the federal government and therequired review boards at the university to test the vaccine onhuman beings.   ``It's a new approach to vaccination with an engineered organismand so it has to pass some standards that many review boards arenot quite used to,'' said Beachey, who also is director of researchat the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Memphis.   Results of work on the vaccine were published last month in theJournal of Experimental Medicine.   The research was conducted by Beachey and Thomas Poirier of theMemphis medical school and Michael Kehoe of the University ofNewcastle in London.   They attached a strep gene to a weakened form of salmonellabacteria that causes typhoid fever.   The salmonella, which has been used for years in a typhoid fevervaccine, was induced by the strep gene to produce a substancecalled M protein, Beachey said.   Given to laboratory mice, the salmonella died quickly in theanimals' intestines while the M protein led to the production ofantibodies for rheumatic fever.   The weakened salmonella, genetically altered in 1985 by otherresearchers, has been given to thousands of people to preventtyphoid fever, but this is the first time it has been used totransmit genetic material from another form of bacteria, Beacheysaid.   ``We're simply using it as a delivery vehicle where we can cloneanother gene into it,'' he said. ``You sort of have a double barrelhere where you're not only vaccinating against typhoid but in thesame dose you're also vaccinating against strep sore throat andrheumatic fever.''   Rheumatic fever, which can cause fatal heart damage, is a majorhealth problem in Third World countries and incidents of thedisease appear to be on the increase in the United States, Beacheysaid.   ``It had declined over the last 20 years but in the last threeor four years it has been rising up again. Here in Memphis we usedto see maybe one or two cases a year and last year we saw 35,'' hesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
