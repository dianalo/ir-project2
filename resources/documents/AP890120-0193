The board will investigate the death of Clement Lloyd, 23, anunarmed black motorcyclist shot in the head by a Hispanic policeofficer Monday.   Riots triggered by the shooting left one man dead and sevenothers shot in two black neighborhoods. Thirteen buildings weretorched and others looted, authorities said.   ``I'm hoping we'll begin to deal seriously with this community'sproblems and do more than just put some iodine on its cancers,''Barry said. After an introductory session, the group agreed to holdits first working meeting on Monday.   William Lozano, 29, the officer who shot Lloyd, remained onsuspension with pay during an internal police investigation. Hisattorney, Roy Black, said he expects the Colombian-born officer tobe indicted in the slaying.   ``He's being made a scapegoat to somehow save the Super Bowl,save civic pride, to stop the riots,'' said Black, who said theofficer fired in self-defense as the motorcycle bore down on him.   Mayor Xavier Suarez announced a 10-point program he called``Miami's comeback plan,'' aimed at giving an economic boost toblack areas and improving police-community relations.   The plan includes special tax districts, business and jobcreation programs and police sensitivity and screening efforts. Heacknowledged that it was only a partial solution and some of theprograms may fail.   ``I guess it's better to dare a little bit,'' the mayor said.   Suarez also met Friday with Yolanda King, daughter of slain civilrights leader Rev. Martin Luther King, and about 200 black leadersand school children at a Liberty City community center, joining themin a call for non-violent resolution to the city's racial problems.   ``We know that a little bit of anger can have good results, andwe hope to turn what was more than a little bit of anger expressedin our community into many, many good results,'' the mayor said.   Black leaders urged Suarez to act quickly without additionalcommittees or studies, and said that without real economic change,Miami's impoverished black neighborhoods would continue to erupt.   ``It's cancerous, and it's going to eat this town alive,'' saidblack Dade County Commissioner Barbara Carey.   Normal activity resumed Friday in the black neighborhoods plaguedby violence earlier in the week, with police relaxing the perimeteraround the Overtown neighborhood and opening up highway exits intothe area.   Most of the 372 people arrested in the riots remained in jail,unable to make cash bail of $250 or more. A state survey found that106 of 185 suspects whose backgrounds were checked had long criminalrecords averaging 11 arrests each.   As the crisis ebbed in the inner-city neighborhoods, securityconcerns turned to Sunday's Super Bowl. Three hundred Metro-Dadepolice officers in uniform and plainclothes will guard Joe RobbieStadium, said police spokesman Jim Hutton.   Only people with tickets will be allowed past the parking gates.No one has applied for a march or demonstration permit, police said,and if protesters do show up and obstruct the entrance, they will bemoved out quickly, Hutton said.   The Rev. Al Sharpton, a New York activist known for hisinvolvement in the Tawana Brawley case, was to arrive in Miami lateFriday.   He announced a rally for Saturday and a tour of Overtown andLiberty City aimed at drawing attention to the plight of blacks inMiami and around the nation.   Miami officials say such demonstrations should not be aimed atthem because the city lacks the money to make any meaningfulimprovements in black neighborhoods.   ``The city government has very limited resources,'' City ManagerCesar Odio said, noting property taxes were already close to theirlegal cap. ``We're almost taxed out. There's no more we can do withtaxes.''</TEXT></DOC>
