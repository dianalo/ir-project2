The Swedes build their own jet fighters, naval crusiers andpatrol boats, artillery, tanks and anti-tank guns, rifles,laser-guided missiles, explosives, radar _ enough weaponry to supplymost of its needs.   But the arms makers are worried because of cutbacks in Swedishmilitary spending and escalating production costs. Companies aretrimming production and talking about merging.   ``It's been considered part of our security policy to produceweapons systems that are necessary to defend Sweden. But that policyhas started to creak at the joints,'' said Paul Palsson, presidentof the state-owned Kockums Marine AB, which builds submarines.   ``Sweden is too small a market to carry the arms industry it has.You have to get out and export.''   With a shrinking home market, pressure to export has promptedsome big companies to evade regulations banning sales to countriesat war or even to regions where conflict is likely.   Two businessmen are on trial for illegal gunpowder exports. Fourexecutives of Bofors AB, the country's biggest arms producer, faceprosecution on charges of selling weapons to Iran and other PersianGulf states.   The country's military chief, Supreme Cmdr. Bengt Gustafsson, hassaid defense policy may have to be redefined, unless the militarygets more money.   The defense network can no longer afford to keep the armsindustry filled with orders, Gustafsson said. His gloomy reports onthe state of the military have triggered one of the biggest defensedebates here since World War II.   ``It feels unreal to hear the Swedish military talk about moremoney at a time of international detente,'' said Maj-Britt Theorin,a leading member of the governing Social Democratic Party.   Dealing in weapons is a sensitive issue in a nation thatchampions world disarmament and where the Swedish Peace andArbitration Society, a peace-promoting group, has been active for105 years.   But defense has become closely linked to economic goals forSweden's welfare state and a population of 8.5 million _ fullemployment, regional development and the well-being of the bigcompanies.   Companies at the heart of Sweden's civilian export industry alsoare involved in arms production:   _Automaker Saab-Scania AB also builds airplanes.   _Ericsson, the telecommunications giant, also makes sophisticatedelectronic military hardware.   Weapons makers employ 27,000 people, or almost 3 percent of theindustrial work force. Arms exports account for less than 1 percentof total foreign business, but they bring enough to keep productionlines going.   The stakes are high in major projects like the development of anew multirole combat plane, the JAS 39 Gripen.   The project, which already has consumed roughly $1.7 billion, is18 months behind schedule. Estimates of the final cost _ around $7billion _ are rising so fast that the plane risks being scrapped.   Gustafsson told a news conference that the project could pay offin the long run, but he added that unless the military got moregovernment money it might have to take the cheaper option and buy anAmerican plane.   Georg Harnsund, head of Saab-Scania, said if the air forcecancels the order, it could spell the end of the Swedish aviationindustry. That would cost thousands of jobs, many of them inone-industry towns, he said.   Sweden has strict export laws that effectively rule out sellingweapons to the countries that use them most.   About 25 percent of total arms production, mainly ammunition andexplosives, is exported, but few of the expensive weapon systemshave been sold abroad.   That will have to change if the arms industry is to survive, saidPalsson, whose shipbuilders secured a $2.5 billion deal in 1987 todevelop a submarine industry in Australia.   The Australian contract, including the sale of eight Swedishvessels, and the 1986 sale of $1.4 billion worth of artillery toIndia, were the two largest arms deals in Swedish history.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Thurs PMs Feb. 9</NOTE></DOC>
