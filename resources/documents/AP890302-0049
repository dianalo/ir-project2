(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jessica Hahn, whose sexual encounter withJim Bakker lead to his ouster from PTL, returned to the city wherethe evangelical organization was founded and said she hopes to runinto Bakker.   If she did, she told reporters Wednesday, ``I'd tell him, `Whatdid you hope to accomplish with all of this? Did you want to get(wife) Tammy jealous or what?'''   Hahn was last in Charlotte in 1987 to testify before a federalgrand jury investigating PTL. The former church secretary from NewYork's Long Island returned for a radio station promotion today.   The Bakkers, who live in Pineville, 10 miles south of Charlotte,have started a television ministry that is shown on some cablenetworks. PTL's properties are now owned by Canadian businessmanStephen Mernick.   Hahn admitted she felt somewhat awkward being in Charlotte. Butshe said she would walk the grounds of Heritage USA, the Fort Mill,S.C., religious retreat that was Bakker's citadel.   ``I really want to go to PTL so I can understand what it's allabout,'' she said. ``It's like trying to find your real father.''   She said she was saddened when the television ministry fell onhard times following the revelation of the tryst.   ``If people want to blame me, fine,'' she said. ``I had so littleto do with PTL falling, but it was that one day that led to it.''   Hahn, who has appeared nude in two Playboy magazine issues and iscurrently featured in a rock video version of ``Wild Thing'' bycomedian Sam Kinison, said she was enjoying her celebrity status.   ``I am 29, I'm a girl and I'm having fun,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
