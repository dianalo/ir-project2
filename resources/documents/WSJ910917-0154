The Salomon Inc. unit's market share of new stock and bondunderwritings sagged to 7.9% during the weeks since thescandal surfaced in early August, down from the biginvestment bank's 10.2% share in the first seven months of1991, according to IDD Information Services Inc.</LP><TEXT>   More important, Salomon's underwriting fees -- which itearns by buying new securities from corporate issuers andreselling them to the public -- plunged to $19.4 million, or4.6% of the overall market, in the five weeks since thescandal broke. That is down sharply from Salomon's 12% shareof Wall Street's underwriting fees for the seven previousmonths, IDD says.   The fee drop reflects a steep decline in Salomon'sunderwriting of new-stock issues, among Wall Street's mostlucrative businesses. Salomon's share of Wall Street'sstock-underwriting business has fallen to just 2.1% since thescandal became public; that's down from 11.5% for the yearthrough July.   Salomon's underwriting slump is the first concrete signalthat the firm's overall profit will be squeezed by thefallout from Salomon's admissions that it exceededTreasury-bidding rules at several government securitiesauctions.   Salomon has never disclosed what percentage of its profitcomes from underwritings; the firm is also a powerhouse insecurities and commodities trading. But Salomon has madestrides in underwriting the past few years. IDD ranks SalomonNo. 5 among all investment banks so far this year, althoughthe firm has slumped to No. 7 for the period since thescandal surfaced. (The rankings are based on full credit tothe lead underwriter.)   Immediately after the Treasury-bidding scandal erupted,Salomon scrambled to protect its underwriting business,including aggressively bidding for the right to finance newbond and stock offerings. In the second full week followingthe scandal, for instance, Salomon managed bond issues thatamounted to nearly 30% of all bond underwritings for theweek.   Salomon officials say the firm's underwriting sag ismerely temporary. They note that overall underwriting volumeon Wall Street slowed in August from 1991's record firsthalf. Thus, a few big deals can skew market-share figures,particularly for the last few weeks.   &quot;You can't infer too much from a couple of weeks'market-share numbers,&quot; says Leo I. Higdon Jr., a Salomon vicechairman and its head of investment banking. &quot;We continue tobe very active in terms of business we're seeing and businesswe're talking to companies about.&quot;   Still, analysts expect some underwriting clients to thinktwice before selecting Salomon because of the lingering stainfrom the Treasury scandal, and the possibility of furtherdamaging disclosures as the investigation continues.   &quot;Salomon has the same talent that won deals for thembefore the scandal hit, but if you have five underwriters andgo to a committee to approve an idea, it's just as easy atthis point to leave Salomon off the list,&quot; says John Keefe,an analyst at Lipper Analytical Securities Corp.   In addition to the slump in underwriting profits, Salomonis expected to set aside tens of millions of dollars inreserves in the third quarter to cover projected costs of anyfines and litigation expenses stemming from theTreasury-bidding scandal. That reserve, coupled with theunderwriting drop, is likely to devastate Salomon'sthird-quarter earnings.   Salomon Inc. earned a record $451 million, or $3.73 ashare, for the first six months of this year.   Salomon has scrambled, so far successfully, to keep mostof its underwriting clients from defecting. A major lossearlier this month was the British Treasury's decision todrop Salomon as lead manager of the U.S. portion of theBritish government's sale of stock in BritishTelecommunications PLC. That offering cost Salomon about $6million in fees, according to Wall Street executives.   Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. has gained the biggest chunkof overall market share amid Salomon's slump. The AmericanExpress Co. unit's share of the underwriting market hasjumped to 12.6% since the Salomon scandal was disclosed, upfrom 9.5% for the year through July, IDD says.   Meanwhile, Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. -- which is ranked No. 1 inunderwriting volume and fees for the year -- has grabbed thebiggest chunk of the stock underwriting business from Salomonduring the past five weeks, according to IDD. Merrill's shareof Wall Street's stock underwriting business has soared to28% from 11.6% over the same period.   So far this month, Salomon has been lead manager for threenew underwritings. All have been debt offerings: a $300million issue for Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., a $750million issue for Federal National Mortgage Association and a$170 million issue for Banc One Corp. Mortgage-backedsecurities such as the Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae offeringshave been a strong point for Salomon since August.   But Salomon's issuance of new stock offerings hastemporarily stalled; the firm has yet to underwrite a singlenew stock issue this month. This is important, because thefees securities firms earn underwriting new stock issues canrun from 3% to 7% of the proceeds.   Despite the drop in stock deals, Salomon cites itscontinued role in several pending equity deals; the biggestis a planned stock offering for Chrysler Corp. That offering,which is expected to raise as much as $500 million in theU.S. and abroad, is currently being marketed to Europeaninvestors.</TEXT></DOC>
