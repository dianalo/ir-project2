Manuel Noriega when theyheld him captive briefly, said one of the coup leaders seekingpolitical asylum here.   Among 42 Panamanians the United States flew to Miami on Saturdaywas Capt. Javier Licona, believed to be the highest-ranking coupparticipant to escape capture, said a Bush administration officialspeaking on condition of anonymity.   ``We're working with the immigration service so that they canremain here, _ those that want to file for asylum,'' Mark Franken,a refugee coordinator for the U.S. Catholic Conference, saidWednesday. ``I expect that will take about a week.''   Adela Bonilla de Giroldi, widow of the major who led theunsuccessful coup, also was among those airlifted to Miami. Shetold The New York Times the coup was betrayed by another officerwho switched sides at the last minute.   She said her husband, Maj. Moises Giroldi Vega, had worked withMaj. Francisco Olechea, commander of the elite Battalion 2000, inplanning the coup.   Battalion 2000, instead of fighting Noriega, was airlifted 55miles from the fighting and led Noriega's troops to crush the coup.``Everything was ready. But Olechea was playing a winner's game andhe failed to come through because of his cowardice,'' she told theTimes in a Miami interview.   Franken said the Panamanians flown into Miami have told him theywant to remain in seclusion for now. But administration officialsare said to be attempting to get more information from the leaderssecluded here.   One rebel leader said that during the daylong coup attempt onOct. 3, the rebels held Noriega hostage for several hours and couldhave killed him at any time, The Miami Herald reported Wednesday.   The rebel, who spoke on condition that neither his name nor thelocation where he was interviewed be disclosed, said his troopsknew him as ``Commandante Trueno'' _ Commander Thunder.   He said junior officers who took part in the coup attempt turnedNoriega over to their superiors, but that leaders of the rebellionhad no desire to kill the general.   ``There was no intention at any time to kill the man,''Commander Thunder said.   When asked why, he said it may have been because a soldier wouldfind it hard to execute his top commander. ``It may have been theirmilitary discipline,'' he said.   Mrs. Giroldi told the Times that three captains who weresupposed to persuade Noriega to surrender ``didn't do it becausethey were cowards.''   ``My husband could have killed Noriega, but he would not dothat. He thought the commander's fate should be decided by thepeople,'' not the United States, she told the paper.   In their public proclamations, the rebels said they had stagedthe coup to ``retire'' Noriega and five senior colonels of thePanamanian Defense Forces.   With Commander Thunder were about a dozen other rebel troopsseeking political asylum. He said they would make no statement asthey waited to hear what their fate would be.   ``We don't want to say anything at this time,'' CommanderThunder said. ``We are awaiting orders.''   Family members of slain coup leader Maj. Moises Giroldi alsowere in the group, State Department spokesman Rich Sanders said. Hewould not confirm whether the group included Giroldi's widow, AdelaBonilla Giroldi, a key intermediary between U.S. officials and thecoup plotters.   Earlier, one of the group said the soldiers feared for theirrelatives at home.   ``Noriega is a beast,'' said the man, who also asked not to beidentified. ``He won't stop at anything. He's going to takereprisals against our wives, our children and our parents back inPanama.''</TEXT></DOC>
