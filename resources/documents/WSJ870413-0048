CFM International is a consortium of Fairfield, Conn.-based GE and Societe Nationale d'Etude andamp; de Construction de Moteurs d'Aviation of France. As previously reported, CFM said early last week it would seek to provide the engine to Airbus, a consortium of four European aircraft makers that is based in Toulouse, France.    GE said CFM expects to deliver the engines in May 1992. The engine is a higher-thrust version of a CFM engine that is being tested in the Airbus A-320, a short-range to medium-range aircraft expected to be delivered to airlines early next year, a GE spokesman said.    As previously reported, International Aero Engine, which was developing a high-thrust engine for the Airbus A-340, decided last week to delay developing its so-called superfan engine. International Aero is a consortium of seven engine makers in five countries, including United Technologies Corp.'s Pratt andamp; Whitney unit. </TEXT></DOC>
