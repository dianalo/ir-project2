The action is bad news for New York-based Quantum,especially the roughly 300 employees being thrown out ofwork. But it may be a sign that the worst is nearly over forthe petrochemical industry, analysts say.</LP><TEXT>   The closings indicate that the &quot;price erosion is prettymuch done in petrochemicals, we're hitting the bone at theselevels,&quot; said Anantha Raman, who operates his own researchfirm in Parsippany, N.J. The over-capacity that has plaguedthe petrochemical business since the late 1980s, when highprices led many companies to build new plants, is finallybeing reduced as old plants are being shut down, he said.   &quot;This is just the beginning of many small shutdowns in theindustry,&quot; added William Young, an analyst with Dean WitterReynolds Inc. in New York.   A sustained rebound in the fortunes of companies such asQuantum that rely heavily on commodity chemical prices fortheir revenue will have to await a turnaround in the economyand greater demand for petrochemical products.   As economic growth slowed around the world, and chemicalcompanies added capacity, ethylene prices plunged about 50%over the past 18 months, from a high of 33 cents to 34 centsa pound in late 1989 to as low as 17 cents a pound currently,Mr. Raman said.   Quantum said it will permanently close its 39-year-oldethylene plant in Tuscola, Ill., one of the oldest plants inthe country making ethylene, a building block of the plasticsindustry, and portions of its Port Arthur, Texas, plantmaking high density polyethylene. The company said it wouldtemporarily close one of the units at its Morris, Ill., plantthat makes low density polyethylene.   The Tuscola plant produced 400 million pounds of ethylenea year and the other plants produced an annual total of 400million pounds of the two types of polyethylene, a plasticscomponent made from ethylene.   The shutdowns hardly leave Quantum short of ethylene. Thecompany started operating a new plant in Deer Park, Texas,earlier this year that is projected to produce more than onebillion pounds of ethylene by year end, and 1.5 billionpounds in 1992.   Quantum spokeswoman Arden Melick said she couldn't confirmanalysts' estimates that the $24 million, 83-cent-a-share,charge associated with the closings would result in a lossfor the second quarter of more than $1 a share. In 1990'ssecond quarter, the company had a gain of 27 cents a sharefrom nonrecurring items, but a loss of 33 cents a share fromcontinuing operations.   In late New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Quantumwas quoted at $12.875, up 25 cents.</TEXT></DOC>
