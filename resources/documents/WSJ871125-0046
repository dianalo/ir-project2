Wardair said it has signed a letter of intent to sell the jets to GPA Group Ltd., Shannon, Ireland, an aircraft leasing concern. Wardair, based in Edmonton, Alberta, declined to disclose the value of the transaction, but industry sources say a single DC-10 has a current market value of about $38 million to $40 million.    Proceeds of the transaction will eliminate all debt associated with past aircraft financings, Wardair said.    In the first nine months of 1987, Wardair had net income of 45.8 million dollars, or 4.41 dollars a share, on revenue of 415.9 million dollars. Net income included an extraordinary gain of 29.9 million on a separate aircraft sale.    Wardair Class A stock closed yesterday at 7.875 dollars, up 37.5 cents, in Toronto Stock Exchange trading. The Class B stock closed at 8.25 dollars, down 25 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
