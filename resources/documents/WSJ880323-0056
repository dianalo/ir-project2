Prices on spot and futures markets continued to fall early yesterday in reaction to Monday's surprise official statement by Saudi Arabia's King Fahd, confirming the kingdom has been selling oil at discount prices. Prices fell even more when Rilwanu Lukman of Nigeria, president of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, postponed indefinitely a muchanticipated news conference.    In Europe, the price of North Sea Brent crude oil traded 55 cents lower, at $14.85 a barrel. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the expiring April-delivery contract for West Texas Intermediate crude -- which broke the $17 barrier for a time Monday -- traded as low as $15.99 before closing at $16.09 a barrel, down 40 cents.    The more-active May contract, however, closed up six cents, at $16.37 a barrel, on some last-minute buying and a strong heating-oil market.    The scheduled Lukman news conference, which had become almost an obsession for many traders, was expected to deal with OPEC output and discounting issues in a price-supporting way.    That the market could tumble merely because of a canceled news conference amused some OPEC watchers. Norman Higby, a Menlo Park, Calif., energy forecaster who frequently chides traders for putting too much faith in OPEC rhetoric, said the news conference simply wasn't needed after King Fahd's statement.    &quot;You can't have a news conference to say 'Gee, (OPEC) production is down,' when King Fahd just announced he will be giving discounts&quot; to sell more oil, Mr. Higby said.    Now, Mr. Higby added, traders will try to figure out just how deep the Saudi discounts are. He said the discounts could be deeper than many traders think, because traders fail to realize Saudi Arabia's overriding goal these days isn't to protect OPEC production quotas, but to get more market share for itself.    Meanwhile, Nymex heating-oil futures rose 0.86 cent, to a three-week high of 46.26 cents a gallon, and unleaded gasoline gained 0.21 cent, to 46.32 cents a gallon, helping to buoy crude somewhat.    Such strength in refined products stemmed partly from traders' expectations that this week's U.S. supply statistics from the American Petroleum Institute, released last evening, would show a big decrease in heating-oil stocks. Strong demand for diesel fuel, which is similar to heating oil, also attracted traders to the refined products, said Andrew Lebow, a broker at E.D. andamp; F. Man International Futures Inc., New York.    After the markets closed, API reported a drop of 4%, or four million barrels, in heating-oil stocks, to almost 98.4 million barrels. That level is 10 million barrels less than the amount on hand last year at this time. Crude stocks rose slightly.    In other commodity markets yesterday:   LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: Cattle and pork prices finished higher. Much of the day's activity was in the hog-futures market, where traders received encouraging predictions about next week's quarterly hog and pig report. The 10-state report, set to be released by the Agriculture Department after the close March 31, should show a 5.5% increase in the hog population to 40.5 million head, compared with 38.4 million head a year ago, said Charles Levitt, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., Chicago. The expectations of a modest increase gave prices reason to rally, Mr. Levitt said. Hog contracts for June and July settlement reached new life-of-contract highs. June closed at 50.75 cents a pound, up 1.37 cents.    SUGAR: May prices rose to a seven-week high of 9.08 cents a pound, up 0.40 cent, on New York's Coffee, Sugar andamp; Cocoa Exchange. The rise was &quot;a technical move, purely,&quot; said Erik Dunlaevy, vice president in charge of sugar at Balfour Maclaine International Ltd., a New York trading house. Besides technical-based buying, traders reacted to continued signs of heavy world demand. There was news that Jordan was buying more than expected -- 35,000 tons -- for early April shipment, said William O'Neill, research director at Elders Futures Inc., New York.    PRECIOUS METALS: Gold prices fell, reacting to weak energy prices and a statement by Federal Reserve Governor Martha Seger that first-quarter economic growth will be &quot;flat&quot; at best. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold closed at $448.70 an ounce, down 50 cents. It was a different story among metals with greater industrial uses. Silver, after Monday's strong gains, added another 1.8 cents to close at $6.465 an ounce. Platinum on the New York Mercantile Exchange closed at $510.40 an ounce, up $7.70. Sharon Ziemian, an assistant vice president in the metals group of Citicorp's Citibank unit, said prices rose on supply concerns, including the labor unrest in South Africa, which mines most of the non-communist world's platinum. </TEXT></DOC>
