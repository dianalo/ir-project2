The ruling settled a disagreement among federal appealscourts over whether individuals with financial woes may filefor reorganization under Chapter 11 or whether they arerestricted to other, sometimes less desirable, bankruptcy-lawprovisions.</LP><TEXT>   The 8-1 decision, written by Justice Harry Blackmun, islikely to encourage increased use of bankruptcy courtreorganization by individuals. Although some proceduraldetails of Chapter 11 make it less convenient in many cases,the volume of individual bankruptcy filings is so great thatit is certain to spill over to Chapter 11 now that the lawhas been clarified.   According to court records, the number of personalbankruptcy filings increases substantially every year. In1985, there were 297,885 personal bankruptcy filings. By1989, the number had nearly doubled to 580,459; last year,there were 660,796 new cases.   Of last year's personal bankruptcy filings, the vastmajority, 468,171, were under Chapter 7. Only 2,116 wereunder Chapter 11, while 190,509 were under Chapter 13.   Chapter 7 of federal bankruptcy law requires the quicksale of many assets to pay creditors. Chapter 13, whichapplies only to those with a regular income and debts of$100,000 or less, allows for as long as five years to pay offdebts.   The advantage of Chapter 11 is that a business orindividual continues to operate and remains in possession ofassets during the reorganization. But unlike other sections,Chapter 11 gives creditors the right to review and eitherapprove or block a reorganization plan. This can make Chapter11 proceedings lengthy and contentious.   &quot;Under Chapter 11, individuals may keep a significantamount of their assets while they reorganize,&quot; said DennisDrebsky, a New York bankruptcy lawyer. &quot;Under Chapter 7,individuals give up almost all of their assets, so it's lessdesirable.&quot;   Yesterday, the high court said that when Congress rewrotefederal bankruptcy law in 1978, the legislators didn't limitChapter 11 to those engaged in business. That is the viewmost federal courts have taken.   But a federal appeals court in St. Louis reached theopposite conclusion in the case of a lawyer and former energyconsultant who filed under Chapter 7 in 1986 beforediscovering that stock he owned was more valuable than he'dthought. Trying to keep the stock rather than have it sold,he asked to change to Chapter 11 status. A federal bankruptcycourt in Missouri dismissed the Chapter 11 petition in 1988,and the appeals court upheld that action in 1990.   The Supreme Court reversed the appeals court decision,over the lone dissenting opinion of Justice John Stevens.(Toibb vs. Radloff)                                                                                                          Post-Contract Arbitration                                                                                                          The high court ruled that companies aren't obliged toarbitrate labor disputes that arise after a collectivebargaining agreement has expired and before agreement hasbeen reached on a new contract.   The 5-4 decision, written by Justice Anthony Kennedy, saida federal appeals court in San Francisco erred when itordered Litton Industries Inc.'s Financial Printing Divisionto arbitrate a dispute over layoffs in 1980 at a Santa Clara,Calif., check-printing plant. The collective bargainingagreement expired in 1979. In 1987, the National LaborRelations Board required Litton to make other grievanceprocedures available to the workers who were laid off, but itrefused to order arbitration. The appeals court reversed theNLRB decision solely on the arbitration issue.   The high court said a company must arbitrate after a laboragreement has lapsed only if the dispute arose before acontract expired or when actions after the expirationinfringe on rights that existed under the contract. Litton'sfailure to consider seniority when laying off workers didn'tqualify as a dispute that arose under an expired contract orin relation to the expired contract, the court said.   Stephen Bokat, director of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce'sNational Litigation Center, said the decision is importantfor unionized companies. The ruling, he said, &quot;givesmanagement another tool to put some pressure on the union&quot; toreach a new agreement.   Justices Stevens and Thurgood Marshall wrote dissentingopinions. Each was joined by Justices Blackmun and AntoninScalia. (Litton Financial Printing Division vs. NLRB)</TEXT></DOC>
