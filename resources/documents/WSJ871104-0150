The Constitution explicitly gives Congress the authority to declare war and the president the authority to conduct a war once declared. By no stretch of the (strictly constructionist) imagination is the congressional role limited to &quot;the power of the purse.&quot;    Diplomacy may be, so to speak, the continuation of war by other means, and Congress institutionally cannot formulate or conduct foreign policy coherently. But that is a problem of sound policy rather than of constitutionality. The Journal's stand seems to depend in part upon where it sits: A number of years ago the Journal was quite happy to have the Senate refuse ratification for the SALT II treaty. It's clear that the Constitution provides important roles for both Congress and the president in the overall conduct and formulation of foreign policy.    It's clear also that the War Powers Act represented an attempt by Congress to slough the blame for the Vietnam disaster onto the presidency, despite the fact that it was Congress that had passed the budgets year in and year out. The real problem now with the War Powers Act is that it allows Congress to take action -- proscription of further U.S. military involvement -- after 60 days without having to take responsibility for the consequences, by virtue of the requirement for a vote only if military operations are to be continued. This problem again is political; it is not constitutional. The War Powers Act would be fine if it provided for a mandatory up-or-down vote in Congress -- on the record -- at the end of the 60-day period, thus forcing Congress to take responsibility for the outcome.    Nor is the Reagan administration blameless. Once again it has chosen to avoid the issue, this time by creating sophistries about whether or not hostilities are imminent in the Persian Gulf. Political responsibility would be strengthened if the administration offered to invoke the War Powers Act in return for a guaranteed and recorded vote after 60 days. Given the likely effects upon U.S. credibility in the Middle East and elsewhere, I doubt that Congress would vote to bring the ships home; ironically, this would serve to strengthen the credibility of U.S. foreign policy.
