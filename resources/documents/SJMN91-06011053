The current system is like an ATM (cash machine) forBIA employees,&quot; said one OMB official.;    &quot;The way I characterized it (is) .. . we've got a bad system, brim-full of bad data, run by people who areinadequately trained,&quot; acknowledged William Bettenberg, a deputy assistantInterior secretary.;    12,000 had access;  Investigators discovered that12,000 people, some not even BIA employees, had access to the BIA's financialrecords. In the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, those people made &quot;over 500,000adjustments&quot; to the agency's accounts, according to a joint OMB-Interiorannouncement. That meant that &quot;for every entry, someone came in and changed it10 times,&quot; the OMB official said.;    Spokesmen for the BIA and Interiorexpressed confidence that most of the accounting changes were proper and saidthey doubted investigators would uncover any criminal activity connected withwhat they acknowledged were longstanding and well-known problems with theBIA's finances.;    Congressional investigators have complained for more thana decade about the poor state of the agency's finances, run out of a largeoffice known in the BIA as &quot;central office-west.&quot; Members of a special Senatecommittee that investigated the BIA two years ago came away so frustrated thatthey called for dismantling the agency and establishing a system of directgrants to Indian tribes.;    The Bush administration opposed therecommendation, but the BIA's many management problems last year won it arating as the worst-run agency in the federal bureaucracy in a Fortunemagazine survey of former government executives who are members of the Councilfor Excellence in Government.;    Limited funding;  Interior Secretary ManuelLujan &quot;has been fighting for two years to tell everyone that the BIA is worthsaving,&quot; said Lujan spokesman Steve Goldstein Thursday. &quot;The problem is we'refaced with a lot of people more willing to fund Indian art gallery openingsthan willing to fund Indian programs.&quot;;    Goldstein said the team of 10 ormore accountants and  financial specialists being dispatched to Albuquerquewould spend up to two years there attempting to resolve the agency's financial problems.;    &quot;We need to find this $95 million,&quot; he said. &quot;The BIAtells the secretary that they don't believe it is stolen. There are accountingdiscrepancies that need to be reconciled.&quot;;    A spokesman for the NationalCongress of American Indians, a Washington group that represents a number ofmajor Native American tribes, said the action was &quot;not surprising&quot; andexpressed doubt that OMB &quot;was big enough&quot; to resolve the problems.;    &quot;Plentyof attention has been directed at that office and they're always blaming theirproblems on their computer system. . . . They always say they're in theprocess of upgrading their system,&quot; said the official.;    Action calledoverdue;  Congressional officials called the administration's action overdue.Patricia M. Zell, chief counsel to the Senate Select Committee on IndianAffairs, described the decision as &quot;an evolutionary response to a problem thathas been consistently identified.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  BILL MCALLISTER AND JOHN LANCASTER, Washington Post  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910111  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1G  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  608  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday, January 11, 199100011053,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
