A study has been carriedout on the airborne concentration, size distribution and dissolutionrate of aerosols to evaluate the inhalation exposure of the workers.Personal air samplers were used for the measurement of concentrationof airborne radioactivity and an Andersen impactor for the particle sizedistribution. The dissolution rates of some of the collected samplesin lung serum simulant were followed for a period of about 200 days.Analysis of the samples revealed the presence of /sup 239/Pu, U, /sup90/Sr and /sup 137/Cs. For all the radionuclides measured (/sup 239/Pu,U, /sup 90/Sr, /sup 137/Cs) 40% of the activity dissolved rapidly (half-time1.2d), the remainder with a half-time of 155 d. Calculation of effectivedose equivalent for this dissolution half-time and for 6.8{mu}m AMADaerosols was carried out using the method recommended in ICRP 30 andreported in literature. The annual effective dose equivalent of the workers,if no respirators are worn, worked out to be 8.9 mSv (890 mrem), thecontribution from alpha emitters being about 91% of the total.</TEXT></DOC>
