(column)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Taylor, Alistair.andM;</AUTHOR><SUMMARY>Scope control is an often overlooked but crucial aspect of projectmanagement that can determine whether a project comes in underbudget and on schedule.andP;  The scope of a project defines the extentof a system and is a crucial aspect of customer relations.andP;  In anefficient system development team, a scope controller isdesignated with authority equal to the project manager.andP;  Theproblem in many system development situations is that a smallchange is requested; then, in the absence of a scope controller,turns the change into a major alteration that can effect othercomponents of the project with resultant confusion and costoverrun problems.andP;  Providing a manager to address scope issuesenables the system developer to retain organizational control andmaximize system development.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Project ManagementSystem DevelopmentCustomer RelationsManagement ConsultingProject Conception.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Controlling project scope is criticalandM;Some systems development projects are winners, others limp home to the finishline over budget and behind schedule.andP;  There are many factors that contributeto project failure, one of the most common is loss of control of scope.andM;The scope of the project summarizes what a system will do for the clients andwhat it will not do.andP;  Controlling project scope is a problem for many systemsorganizations.andP;  This article describes a solution.andM;If you are currently scheduling a development project, take a pencil and theproject organization chart and draw a box just to the right of the one thatidentifies the project manager.andP;  Then take a red pen and, in uppercasecharacters, write the following: THE SCOPE CONTROLLER.andP;  Here's why ...andM;Consider a familiar project scenario.andP;  Functional specifications aresigned-off and development of the system begins.andP;  Throughout the developmentphase requests for changes are received from the clients.andP;  The changerequests are negotiated upon and either included in the project, discarded,or deferred until a future release.andM;The project team is already hard at work performing the tasks outlined in theoriginal project schedule and team members do not have the time to carefullyevaluate requests for changes.andP;  In the interest of maintaining momentum theteam quickly agrees to incorporate a 'small change' to the specifications.andM;Re-open negotiationsandM;After further analysis the 'small change' turns out to be not so small -- itis in fact a major change with serious ramifications.andP;  And the foundation forfailure has been laid: the scope of the project has changed without are-evaluation of the project budget and schedule.andM;Project managers can attempt to re-open negotiations with the clients at thispoint but their bargaining position is a weak one, after all they've alreadyagreed to the change.andM;Typically, the only recourse available to the manager is to perform more workwithin the same period of time.andP;  This often compounds an already tightschedule, as most project teams are over-committed when the originalspecifications are signed-off.andM;The role of the Scope Controller is to monitor requests for changes and toadvise the project stakeholders when a change has altered the scope of theproject.andM;Traditionally this has been the responsibility of the project manager, butthat individual is often too involved in the day-to-day development issuesand too emotionally attached to the project to monitor change requests in amethodical and objective manner.andM;The Scope Controller's only task on the project is to monitor the scope.andP;  Heor she should not be added to the project team until the specs have beenfinalized -- this is the point in time when the project becomes mostvulnerable to scope changes.andM;It is critical at this point that at least one individual has the time tocarefully evaluate requests for changes.andP;  Too often changes are agreed toonly to allow the project team to return to the tasks that were underway whenthe request was received.andP;  Only later, when the request is examined indetail, are the consequences understood.andM;The Scope Controller should be external to the immediate departments ororganizations affected by the project.andP;  Individuals from other branches ofthe systems department and from user departments other than the sponsoringone should be considered.andM;Ideally, the Scope Controller has been involved in several systemsdevelopment projects and is familiar with the damage that can be caused byunmanaged scope changes; the missed deadlines, the unmet expectations, thetarnished image of the systems department, the career casualties.andM;External consultantsandM;Project managers from one systems area should serve as the Scope Controlleron projects in other systems areas.andP;  While making an important contributionto a project they will gain valuable experience that will assist them withthe management of their own projects.andM;Alternatively, the organization may choose to use the skills of externalconsultants.andP;  They can provide the most objective evaluation of changerequests, they enter the project with no pre-conceived notions or allegiancesto people or departments.andM;The tools required to perform this activity are the Project Charter, theProject Dictionary, and the Change Request Documents.andM;The Scope Controller evaluates change requests and dictionary updates withspecial emphasis on how they relate to the scope of the project as stated inthe Charter.andM;When a scope change is detected the Scope Controller chairs a meeting withthe project manager and the sponsoring user.andM;Onus is on clientandM;It is understood that the group is not meeting to discuss a 'small change',rather they are meeting to discuss issues that threaten the project scheduleand budget.andM;It is also understood that the onus is on the client to present a businesscase that justifies the implementation of the change.andP;  Too often it is up tothe project team to justify to the client why the change should not beimplemented.andM;If it is agreed that the requested change must be implemented then newschedules and budgets must be prepared; i.e.andP;  the client must be willing topay the price.andP;  The Project Charter must also be changed to reflect the newscope.andP;  Future change requests will be evaluated in relation to the modifieddocument.andM;Scope Controllers are experienced professionals, they know that changerequests cannot be evaluated merely in terms of budget dollars and scheduledates.andM;They know that every project team assumes certain characteristics, one beinga threshold number of tasks that can be performed well, another being athreshold number of team members that can be managed efficiently.andM;And they know that project teams operate very close to, or sometimes evenbeyond, those levels throughout most of the life cycle of the project.andM;Unmanaged expansion of the scope of a project can easily lead the projectteam into 'panic mode'.andM;Sometimes it is appropriate and necessary to accept the fact that a projecthas reached the point where additional resources will do more harm than good.andM;It is extremely difficult for those whose career paths may be directlyaffected by the outcome of the project to do this, only the most astute MISmanager recognizes that the project manager who refuses the offer ofadditional resources may in fact be pursuing the wise policy.andM;Once project teams have been organized, schedules developed, and tasksassigned; inserting new people into a project can be a horrendous task.andP;  TheScope Controller understands these human issues and is well positioned tomake recommendations based on that knowledge.andM;We are not suggesting that changes to the scope of a project never beconsidered.andP;  What we are suggesting is that they be recognized as threats toschedules and budgets and that they be monitored by someone who is removedfrom the day-to-day project issues.andM;The author is a systems designer with the Manufacturers Life Insurance Co.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
