Once the expected allied ground offensive begins againstdug-in Iraqi troops in Kuwait, the fate of thousands of U.Ssoldiers and Marines will hang on how well an arsenal ofhigh-tech weapons perform in combat. To avoid a bloodbath,U.S. commanders are counting on several weapons systems tomatch the spectacular success registered in the air so far bythe Patriot anti-missile missile, the Tomahawk cruise missileand precision-guided &quot;smart&quot; bombs.</LP><TEXT>   The ground-warfare technology, never before tested inbattle, includes some of the most controversial weapons everdeveloped by the Army: the M-1 tank, the Bradley FightingVehicle and the Apache helicopter. Should these systems failto perform as advertised, U.S. forces could find theirmobility and firepower hampered. Should the weapons succeed,though, they will sharply enhance the U.S. tactical edge overthe Iraqi units in Kuwait.   How these weapons systems and others hold up in the heatof desert warfare will also affect the size and shape ofPentagon budgets for the next generation of weapons, as wellas the sales -- and bottom lines -- of hundreds of defensecontractors and subcontractors. Funding for a weapon thatflops could very well be canceled by Congress.   A ground campaign isn't likely to provide as muchspectacular television footage of high-tech destruction asthe air campaign has. Lost in last weekend's excitement was aknock-out blow dealt by the Army VII Corps in eastern SaudiArabia. Corps artillerymen silenced an Iraqi surface-to-airmissile site, using LTV Corp.'s multiple-launch rocketsystem, which can deliver in a single salvo as much firepoweras an entire battalion of eight-inch howitzers.   While the desert is ideal for employing sophisticatedairborne weapons, the terrain could work to the disadvantageof a high-tech attacking force. &quot;The ground is a moredifficult environment for electronic weapons to operate ineffectively,&quot; says defense analyst Barry Blechman. &quot;There'smore clutter, more hiding places. I don't think it will be asdramatic or as bloodless.&quot;   He and other analysts don't expect the ground campaign togo as well as the opening days of the air war, primarilybecause ground warfare is the Iraqi military's strong suit.   &quot;Our ground weapons really haven't been put to the test,&quot;adds Jeffrey Record, a defense analyst who has been criticalof Pentagon procurement policies. To a considerable extent,he says, the performance of the U.S. weapons will &quot;depend onthe quality and strength of the resistance.&quot;   In the desert, sand itself can be as much a foe as theRepublican Guard troops that Saddam Hussein is holding inreserve in southern Iraq.   &quot;The sand is just eating everything alive,&quot; says ChiefWarrant Officer Bruce Bramblett, a Blackhawk helicopter pilotin an Army aviation brigade in Saudi Arabia. &quot;It's reallytearing into our rotor blades.&quot; In addition, protective tapeput on the blades to reduce wear peels off whenever thechoppers go up in rainy weather.   The $2.5 million M-1 Abrams tank, the Army's and Marines'main battle tank, has been dogged by questions about itsreliability -- and its gas mileage -- in a sustained desertpush, which might be likely if allied forces attempt to sweeparound the west end of the Iraqi defensive line. &quot;We have atank with limited mobility because of all its problems,&quot;charges Pierre Sprey, a defense consultant and one-timeaircraft designer.   But Howard Roberts, vice president, tank programs, for theM-1's maker, General Dynamics Corp., says, &quot;I don't worry atall about it.&quot; The M-1, he says, has undergone 700,000 milesof desert testing, and &quot;the Army has told us the tank issurpassing all their goals&quot; in terms of reliability.   The latest model of the M-1 is a computer-controlledversion that automatically pinpoints any mechanical problems;the drive train, if necessary, can be overhauled in about 30minutes. In battle, the tank can fire its 120mm gun on therun, thanks to its electronic innards that include athermal-imaging system, a digital ballistic computer and anadvanced stabilization system. The tank's cooling system isdesigned to give soldiers the ability to survive attacks bybiological and chemical weapons.   A bravura performance in Operation Desert Storm couldstrengthen General Dynamics's revenue. Currently, the M-1accounts for about 10% of the company's annual sales. Thoughforeign orders will keep the M-1 line open at least throughthe mid-1990s, the U.S. has no plans to order more after1993. Already, the company is planning to mothball one of itstwo M-1 plants.   The Bradley Fighting Vehicle, made by FMC Corp., wouldalso be an integral part of any end sweep or, if necessary,any armored punch through Iraqi defenses. But critics in theso-called military-reform movement contend that enemy firecan turn the lightly armored vehicle into a &quot;flaming coffin&quot;if it hits the fuel tank. John Krings, the former chief ofweapons testing for the Pentagon, told Congress in 1989 thatcrews actually survived best when they were outside thethin-skinned vehicle because of its vulnerability toanti-tank missiles.   Footage of burning Bradleys would be disastrous for FMC'sdefense group, which derives about one-third of its $900million in sales from the Bradley program. But an FMCspokesman says the Bradley's armor has been strengthened witha layer of Kevlar, and an Army spokesman says the fuel tankhas been moved to a less vulnerable area to better protectcrew members.   If a full-scale ground war begins in the Mideast, it willbe more of an air-land war, with aircraft and helicoptersproviding close-in air support and surveillance for infantry,armored and Marine amphibious units. It could be the firstbig battle in which helicopter gunships take on tanks.Result: The AH-64 Apache helicopter, built by McDonnellDouglas Corp., could be the most closely scutinized weaponssystem of all.   Pentagon watchdogs and lawmakers have long faulted theApache for unreliability. In the U.S. invasion of Panama,Apaches broke down so often that mechanics had to cannibalizedowned models for parts and dry critical electronic parts inkitchen ovens.   But McDonnell Douglas insists that such problems are oldnews, and the Army agrees. Apaches deployed in the Mideasthave an average readiness rate of 82%, as compared with theArmy's 75% standard. If Apache pilots knock out a lot oftanks with their laser-guided Hellfire missiles, it could bea boon to McDonnell Douglas and Rockwell International Corp.,maker of the Hellfire.   Another high-tech helicopter facing a test of its mettleis the Cobra attack helicopter, made for the Marine Corps byTextron Inc.'s Bell Helicopter unit. Retired Army Gen. DonaldKeith, who helped oversee weapons development for many years,believes the Pentagon's post-Vietnam investment in the Cobraand other costly weapons systems will pay off. He expects thelaser-guided Copperhead shell, fired from a 155mm howitzer,to perform &quot;the kinds of things you've seen laser-guidedbombs do&quot; to Iraqi targets.   &quot;From all I know about the inherent quality of the stuff,they should do fine,&quot; Gen. Keith said. &quot;Most of the criticsof the ground systems are the same people who criticizedeverything that's lauded today in the air war. The troops arevery confident in the {new} equipment.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
