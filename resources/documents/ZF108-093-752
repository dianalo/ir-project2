Tucson, AZ85704; (602)293-6363.andM;List Price: LANtastic starter kit (two 2Mbps adapter cards, NOS networklicense, 15-foot cable and terminators), $525; additional 2Mbps cards, $249;adapter-independent NOS, $495andM;Requires: 40K RAM on server, 12K RAM on workstation, CD-ROM drive withcontroller, MSCDEX, DOS 3.1 or later.andM;In Short: A great solution for users without an existing LAN, this versatilenetwork is easy to use and gives workstations simultaneous access to multipledrives.andP;  The operating system's built-in compability with MSCDEX offers thecleanest network integration possible.andM;Artisoft includes CD-ROM support as a standard part of its network operatingsystem, LANtastic.andP;  Selected as an Editor's Choice in our last review oflow-cost LANs (see &quot;Building Workgroup Solutions: Low-Cost LANs,&quot; PCMagazine, March 28, 1989), the system offers full networking capbility bysharing both a hard disk and a printer through specialized network interfacecards, and it also icludes a built-in capability for sharing CD-ROM drivesacross the network.andP;  If you don't already have a network established,LANtastic is an excellent alternative for CD-ROM sharing.andM;By including the ability to address the Microsoft CD-ROM extensions in theLANtastic operating system, Artisoft provides the cleanest integrationpossible for CD-ROMs in a network.andP;  Under LANtastic, you run the MicrosoftCD-ROM extensions only on the server--not on each workstation.andM;The systems makes no assumptions about the data-storage devices (for example,hard disks, tape drives, or CD-ROMs) the operating system will manage.andO;LANtastic uses standard DOS calls (Int 21) to access the storage device, butthe operating system was written with the ability to pass calls to theMicrosoft CD-ROM extensions on the server.andM;USES NONDEDICATED SERVERandM;Artisoft's menu-driven installation program copies the files from thedistribution disk to the proper directory structure.andP;  Your next step is toinstall a CD-ROM drive with the proper device driver and a copy of theMicrosoft CD-ROM extensions, supplied by the drive manufacturer, on the PCthat will be the CD-ROM server.andP;  Fortunately, the PC does not have to bededicated to the task.andP;  As the device driver loads, the next availablelogical drive letters are assigned to the CD-ROM drives.andM;After installing LANtastic, the program's menu lets you initiate an automaticbroadcast to the network, which tells each station which drive letter isassigned to the CD-ROM device driver.andP;  You then assign a network share nameto the shared resource and inform LANtastic that the resource is a CD-ROMdrive, after which the operating system channels access requests it receivesfrom application programs to the Microsoft CD-ROM extensions.andP;  LANtastic alsosupports multiple CD-ROM drives by letting you give each drive a differentnetwork share name.andM;When you want to access a particular drive on a CD-ROM server, you haveLANtastic link one of your unused drive letters to the named server anddrive.andP;  In other words, if you want your D: drive maped to a drive namedDATABASE on the CD-ROM server named CDSERVER, you enter the command NET USED: \\CDSERVER\DATABASE on the DOS command line.andP;  The networking softwaremakes the link and directs the database retrieval software to your D: driveto find its data.andM;BENEFITS FROM LARGE CACHEandM;As with al network system, LANtastic provides faster CD-ROM service, at leaston repeat queries, if you outfit the CD-ROM server with a large disk cache.andO;LANtastic does not come with a disk cache utility, but you'll find itcompatible with the utilities reviewed in &quot;Getting the Most Out of Memory,&quot;(PC Magazine, February 14, 1989).andP;  Even without caching software installed,however, LANtastic gave reasonably fast responses to single and multipledatabases.andM;Our test bed configuration--a PC workstation ready to use any networkfeature, including a CD-ROM server--lost only 11K of RAM after we loaded allthe necessary software.andP;  The network software on the CD-ROM server occupied amore substantial 42K of RAM.andM;In addition, LANtastic offers multiple levels of security for all printers,disk drives, or any other resources that can be used on the network.andP;  Inorder to control access to the CD-ROM drive, the system administrator createsspecial group names for users needing access.andM;Installing a LANtastic network for CD-ROM service is practical if you don'talready have a network installed.andP;  The comparative costs may initially seemhigh because you have to buy the complete network--including the interfacecards, cables, and software--but for the price, you get full networkingcapabilities plus CD-ROM service.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
