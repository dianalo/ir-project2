The FMP was developedby the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) under the MagnusonFishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act) and is implementedby regulations for the foreign fishery at 50 CFR Part 611 and for the U.S.fishery at 50 CFR Part 675. One of the groundfish species managed under the FMP is pollock, which U.S.fishermen have been catching and delivering to foreign processing vesselsfor joint venture processing (JVP). The current season for the JVP pollockfishery is divided into two parts as a result of Amendment 11 to the FMP(52 FR 45966, December 3, 1987) and is referred to as the pollock ``splitseason.'' The first part of the split season starts January 15 and is allowedto continue until JVP fishermen have harvested the sum of 40 percent ofthe JVP specification for pollock plus 15 percent of the initial pollocktotal allowable catch (TAC). The second part of the split season startsApril 15 and is allowed to continue until the JVP pollock specificationhas been reached. The regulation implementing the split season will expireafter 1989, having been in effect for two years. The split season served two purposes. One, since pollock spawn during Februarythrough early April, the resulting hiatus from the interim season closureafforded a conservation benefit to the pollock stock to the extent thatfuture reproductive success might have been enhanced. Second, the domesticprocessing (DAP) industry benefited to the extent that vessels deliveringto domestic processors were able to harvest pollock on fishing groundsfree from JVP competition during the interim closure. During 1988, the first year of the regulation implementing the split season,TACs for pollock were set at 1,300,000 metric tons (mt) and 45,000 mt inthe Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands subareas, respectively, (53 FR 894,January 14, 1988). The initial JVP specifications for pollock in the BeringSea and Aleutian Islands subareas were set at 490,838 mt and 34,090 mt,respectively. The permissible amounts allowed for JVP fishing in thesesubareas during the first part of the split season were 274,335 mt and16,336 mt, respectively. After the 1988 season started on January 15, as many as 90 U.S. catchervessels operating in the Bering Sea subarea delivered pollock to about70 foreign processing vessels in the directed fishery. The first part ofthe split season was closed on February 9, 1988 (53 FR 4178, February 12,1988). The catch limit during the first part was harvested at an averagerate of about 91,000 mt per week. The Council's preliminary recommendation for the 1989 pollock TAC in theBering Sea subarea again is 1,300,000 mt, but the JVP proposed apportionmentof this amount is only 205,000 mt (53 FR 47998, November 29, 1988). Inthe Aleutian Islands subarea, the Council's preliminary recommendationfor the 1989 pollock TAC is 45,000 mt and the JVP apportionment is 34,090mt. Under the ``split season'' amendment, only 160,000 mt in the BeringSea subarea and 16,336 mt in the Aleutian Islands subarea would be availableduring the first part of the split season. A total of 176,336 mt wouldbe available, therefore, for harvest during the first part of the 1989split season. At the rate of harvest of 91,000 mt per week that was experiencedduring the first part of the split season during the 1988 fishery, the176,336 mt initially available could be harvested by joint venture fishermenwithin about two weeks. Joint venture fishing representatives testified at the Council's September28-November 1, 1988 meeting that at this level of fishing the split seasonin the pollock fishery would impose unnecessary and unacceptable economiccosts. Since the season would be brief, JVP fishermen would likely departthe Bering Sea and foreign processors would also disperse. Most of theJVP vessels would be idle until the April 15 starting date of the secondpart of the split season and then return to the Bering Sea to participateagain in a very short season. The Council concurred with this analysis,recognizing that the split season was effective in the 1988 fishery, butwould have no useful purpose in the 1989 fishery. Spawning pollock wouldescape the joint venture fishery during the interim closure but would likelybe caught in the DAP fishery. Because the DAP apportionment is so large,DAP should have a competitive fishing advantage over JVP without the splitseason. Any disadvantage to DAP as a result of JVP receiving part of theapportionment would occur even without the split season. The Council, therefore,voted to recommend that the Secretary implement an emergency rule undersection 305(e) of the Magnuson Act to substitute the split season regulationwith a single JVP pollock fishing season beginning January 15. Joint venture representatives have provided the Alaska Regional Director,NMFS, examples of operating costs that JVP fishermen would incur if thesplit season were effective in 1989. Each Seattle-based catcher vesselwould spend about $13,000 in fuel to make the round trip to the BeringSea and back to Seattle. While not every vessel would return to Seattlefollowing the first pollock season, a conservative estimate of the numberof vessels that would return is about 50. Since daily fuel consumptionis about 800 gallons per day and a round trip takes 18 days, about $13,000in fuel costs are required per vessel. Under the split season regulation,a vessel operator would spend this amount to return for the second partof the season. Fifty vessels, then, would spend $650,000.Other factors contributing to increased operating costs are those relatedto increased maintenance and repair of vessels as a result of longer runningtime, and reduced labor productivity as a result of lost time on the partof crew members by having to make two round trips. These factors are difficultto quantify, given variation in vessel condition and other employment opportunitiesfor crew members, but would add additional costs on joint venture fishermen.The Secretary has reviewed this issue and concurs with the Council's recommendations.He finds that continuation of the JVP split season for pollock fishingserves no worthwhile purpose and imposes burdensome and unnecessary costson the industry that are not acceptable. He is implementing an emergencyrule under section 305(e) of the Magnuson Act that authorizes the pollockseason to start on January 15 as scheduled, and continues through December31, 1989, subject to other management measures authorized under 50 CFRPart 675. <ITAG tagnum="84">Classification </ITAG>The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, has determined that thisrule is necessary to respond to an emergency situation and that it is consistentwith the Magnuson Act and other applicable law. This rule is implementedfor 90 days under section 305(e) of the Magnuson Act. The Assistant Administrator also finds for good cause that the reasonsjustifying promulgation of this rule on an emergency basis also make itimpractical and contrary to the public interest to provide prior noticeand opportunity for comment or to delay for 30 days its effective date,under provisions of section 553 (b) and (d) of the Administrative ProcedureAct. This rule must be implemented as soon as possible if it is to accomplishits intended effect. The National Marine Fisheries Service prepared an environmental assessmentfor this action and concluded that no significant impact on the human environmentwould result from this rule. A copy of this document may be obtained fromthe address above. This emergency interim rule is exempt from the normal review proceduresof Executive Order 12291 as provided in section 8(a)(1) of that order.It is being reported to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget,with an explanation of why it is not possible to follow the regular proceduresof that order. This emergency interim rule is exempt from the requirements of the RegulatoryFlexibility Act, because it is issued without opportunity for prior publiccomment. This rule does not contain a collection of information requirement subjectto the Paperwork Reduction Act. The Assistant Administrator has determined that this rule will be implementedin a manner that is consistent to the maximum extent practicable with theapproved coastal zone management program of the State of Alaska. This determinationhas been submitted for review by the responsible State agencies under section307 of the Coastal Zone Management Act. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 675 </ITAG>Fisheries.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: December 30, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James W.
