MichelAoun today burned tires and demonstrated in Lebanon's Christianenclave against Parliament's peace plan that shifts political powerto the Moslem majority.   However, the right-wing Phalange Party, the main Christianpolitical organization in Lebanon, declared support for the peaceplan worked out by Lebanese legislators during three weeks ofdiscussions in Taif, Saudi Arabia.   The Lebanese forces, the main Christian militia, did not rejectthe plan aimed at ending 14 years of civil war, saying it hadpositive points.   Aoun had ordered his 20,000 troops on alert, after he rejectedthe peace plan because it does not include a clear timetable forthe withdrawal of Syria's 40,000 troops from Lebanon.   Salim Hoss, head of the rival Moslem government, also mustapprove the plan. He made no immediate comment, but senior aidessaid on condition of anonymity that he supports the Taif accords.   Smoke billowed from the burning tires as schools, banks,government offices and other businesses closed, abiding by a strikecall by Aoun's Christian cabinet.   About 10,000 youths, mainly students, demonstrated in Christianeast Beirut.   ``We sacrifice our blood for the general!'' the demonstratorschanted as many of them waved huge posters of the 54-year-oldMaronite Catholic soldier.   ``Yes, yes to the general. No, no to Taif!'' the demonstratorssaid as they headed to Aoun's headquarters at the bomb-ravagedpresidential palace in suburban Baabda, east of Beirut.   Addressing the demonstrators, Aoun said the accord's wording ofa Syrian withdrawal ``is very vague, from now until eternity.''   Moslems have argued that the Syrian presence was their onlyguarantee that political reforms would occur.   ``We don't want to give away our beloved land,'' Aoun said inhis 15-minute address. He has said the Lebanese people should voteon the accord and offered to step down if they support theparliamentary plan.   The Phalange Party, in a statement published by the daily paperAs-Safir and other newspapers, called for a ``unified Christianstand to pursue implementation of the Taif plan.''   Phalangist leader George Saadeh, who also heads the LebaneseFront alliance of right-wing Christian forces, was one of thelegislators who worked out the peace plan.   The Lebanese forces, the main Christian militia in the civilwar, said it was holding contacts with Aoun and other Christianleaders to formulate a ``unified Christian stand on the Taifaccord.''   When Lebanon received independence in 1943, the majorityChristians were given a 6-to-5 advantage over Moslems in allgovernment posts. Moslems now make up more than 50 percent of thenation's population.   Lebanon's pro-Syrian Moslem and leftist militias have expresseddissatisfaction with the peace plan, mainly for not giving them asmuch power in running the nation's affairs as they had requested.   The Progressive Socialist Party of Druse warlord Walid Jumblattand the mainstream Shiite Moslem Amal militia called meetings toformulate their stands on the accord.   Jumblatt, Syria's main ally in Lebanon, said Monday he was nothappy with the accord but would accept it ``upon Syria's request.''   Amal, headed by Nabih Berri, also rejected the plan because itdid not provide greater representation in parliament for the 1.2million Shiites, Lebanon's largest single sect.   Under the plan, the 99-seat chamber will be expanded to 108,equally divided between Moslems and Christians. Amal had demandedthe number be increased to 128 and hoped to get most of theadditional seats.   At least 930 people were killed and 2,744 wounded in six monthsof fierce artillery duels between Aoun's forces and Syrian gunnersuntil an Arab League-sponsored cease-fire took hold Sept. 22.   The latest outbreak began in March after Aoun blockaded illegalmilitia-run ports and the Moslem-Syrian alliance responded byshelling the Christian enclave.</TEXT></DOC>
