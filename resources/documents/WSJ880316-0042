Mr. Walsh instructed his aides to prepare the final papers stating the charges, and his staff has indicated to defense attorneys that indictments are imminent.    The principal targets are former White House National Security Adviser John Poindexter, Lt. Col. Oliver North, retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord, and Albert Hakim, an American-Iranian businessman. The main charge Mr. Walsh is expected to seek is that the four conspired to defraud the U.S. government by diverting proceeds from secret Iranian arms sales to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.    Mr. Walsh's long-awaited move would cap a 15-month investigation into the highest circles of the White House, and it could shed new light on the policy blunders and alleged cover-up that plunged President Reagan into his most serious foreign policy crisis.    The anticipated charges, coming on the heels of former National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane's guilty plea last week to charges he misled Congress, are expected to renew public discussion of the affair. They also are likely to heighten the debate in the presidential race over Vice President George Bush's knowledge of secret arms sales to Iran and the administration's efforts to assist the Contras.    Defense attorneys for the four men either couldn't be reached or declined to comment, and Mr. Walsh's office declined to comment on the status of the investigation. But some sources said they believed that a federal grand jury here would be asked to return indictments either at its scheduled meeting today or early next week.    One lawyer familiar with the investigation said there is &quot;no question&quot; that criminal charges were imminent. Mr. Walsh has argued previously that proceeds from the arms sales to Iran belonged to the U.S. government, and he has said he was looking into an alleged &quot;conspiracy to defraud the government by misusing its resources and diverting its funds.&quot;    As part of his wide-ranging inquiry, which included more than 1,000 interviews and grants of immunity to at least 13 witnesses, Mr. Walsh also has been investigating whether Col. North and others attempted to obstruct or mislead congressional investigators and illegally destroyed relevant documents.    Moreover, Mr. Walsh's investigators have looked closely at whether Col. North -- the central player in the Iran-Contra affair -- or his associates improperly benefited from the proceeds of the Iranian weapons sales and the covert resupply of the Contras. The prosecutor's investigators also have examined whether federal income tax laws were violated.    They are going to indict on everything they can,&quot; said the attorney familiar with Mr. Walsh's investigation. &quot;They are going to throw in everything but the kitchen sink.&quot;    Before any trial on the charges, the prosecution is likely to face lengthy and contentious legal challenges by defense attorneys. Some lawyers think such maneuvering could take as long as a year. Arguments are likely over defense assertions that the evidence gathered by Mr. Walsh was tainted by immunity granted to key witnesses for their congressional testimony last summer; that the funds generated in the Iran-Contra operations belonged to the private network run by Gen. Secord and Mr. Hakim; and that Mr. Walsh's appointment as an independent counsel is unconstitutional. Trials in the case could last for many more months.    Mr. Walsh's investigation will continue into another phase of the scandal -- the activities of some Central Intelligence Agency officials and agents who helped support the Contras when Congress restricted U.S. assistance under various versions of the so-called Boland amendment.    Law enforcement officials also have said Mr. Walsh's staff will continue investigating whether Messrs. North and Poindexter, while at the National Security Council, obstructed Contra-related criminal investigations by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Justice Department.    Mr. Walsh's investigation has been hampered by difficulties in obtaining documents from some of the targets and getting information from Israel about that country's role in the arms-for-hostages swap. The special prosecutor made preliminary plans to seek indictments last summer and again earlier this year, but each time opted to delay action to gather additional evidence. This time, however, Mr. Walsh instructed his staff to finish all investigative work on the central conspiracy case by this week, according to sources familiar with the investigation.    Officials yesterday said Mr. Walsh hadn't informed the White House about his specific plans. </TEXT></DOC>
