On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the January contract forWest Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude oil, settled 40cents higher at $15.32 a barrel, near its high for the day of$15.35. The contract price had fallen 11 cents a barrel on Tuesday.Other contract months also rose, though not as sharply.   Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange, theDecember contract for unleaded gasoline soared 2.18 cents to finishat 49.05 cents a gallon. The December contract for wholesale homeheating oil rose 0.53 cent to 48.32 cents a gallon. Other contractmonths for both products also advanced.   Analysts said two encouraging developments helped strengthenprices.   Non-OPEC oil-producing countries are showing signs of wanting tocooperate with OPEC countries to help reduce the glut of oil onworld markets, said Bob Baker, an analyst with Prudential-BacheSecurities Inc.   ``That's very important psychologically,'' Baker said. ``It's notthat non-OPEC countries are going to cut back much, but it couldshow some positive response.''   In addition, the oil minister from the United Arab Emiratescontinued to make efforts to soften remarks he made on Monday thathis country did not consider its new OPEC production quota the``official'' quota.   On Monday, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countriessigned a new agreement to limit the cartel's production to 18.5million barrels a day from the present level of around 22.5 million.The cartel also maintained its benchmark price of $18 a barrel,which it hopes to achieve in the first half of 1989.   Analysts said Wednesday's oil futures prices also were helped bybullish weekly statistics on U.S. inventories from the AmericanPetroleum Institute and the expiration of the December contracts onthe Mercantile Exchange.   Late Tuesday, new weekly API data showed declines in crude andgasoline inventories. Gasoline stocks dropped 2.5 million barrelslast week and crude stocks fell 2.6 million.</TEXT></DOC>
