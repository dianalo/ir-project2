In greenhouse tests, corn borer damage was reduced by 80 percentin plants inoculated with the naturally occurring microorganism,according to a statement released Friday by Crop GeneticsInternational of Hanover, Md.   ``This is the first time that a plant has been able to grow itsown genetically-engineered pesticide in its vascular system,'' thecompany said.   The borer is a pest on 20 million acres of the U.S. corn crop,the company said. U.S. farmers annually lose 200 million bushels ofcorn worth $500 million to the borer.   ``If it proves to be effective, if it can be easily used and itis not too costly it will do Minnesota farmers a lot of good,''said Ken Ostlie, a University of Minnesota entomologist.   Minnesota lost an average of $107 million worth of corn to theborer from 1981 to 1983, years in which borer infestation wasparticularly bad, Ostlie said.   The microorganism, whose scientific name is Bacillusthuringiensis, is harmless to humans and animals, making itpreferable to chemical pesticides, according to the company, whichspecializes in developing biological pesticides.</TEXT><NOTE>Georgetown Paper Skips Publication Over Ad For Abortion Rally</NOTE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Georgetown University students have refused topublish an edition of their newspaper because school officialsforbade them to run an advertisement on an abortion rights rally.   The Roman Catholic university's stand on the advertisementprompted swift protests from pro-choice organizations and nationaleducation groups.   ``The ad was not promoting any specific service,'' said KarlHente, a senior who serves as the paper's managing editor. ``The adwas for a pro-choice rally and was basically expressing a politicalviewpoint. The newspaper's foundation is freedom of expression.''   The twice-weekly Georgetown Hoya had first asked universityofficials to review the ad, but when the university was slow torespond, the paper's student board of directors voted on Wednesdayto include the ad in Friday's edition.   The school's dean of students, Jack deGioia, then told newspaperofficials that they could not publish the issue with the ad, andthe paper's board responded by voting unanimously not to put out apaper at all.   The newspaper did print up and distribute around campus severalthousand flyers explaining the decision not to publish.</TEXT></DOC>
