By a 4-1 vote, the commission ruled that Mr. Trump'sproposed restructuring of the Taj Mahal casino's $605 millionof debt was sufficient to achieve financial stability.However, the commission raised questions about Mr. Trump'spersonal financial health and will hold additional hearingslater this month.</LP><TEXT>   No mention was made of the involvement of First FidelityBancorp.'s First Fidelity bank in the proposed Taj Mahalrestructuring. People close to the negotiations say the NewJersey bank, which has a $75 million mortgage on the TajMahal, still hasn't signed off on the proposed restructuring.
