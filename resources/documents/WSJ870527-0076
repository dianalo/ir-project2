Boesky.    Mr. Boesky had argued that disclosure of evidence in the cases might interfere with the government's continuing criminal investigation of insider trading, and thus hurt his prospects of a lighter sentence based on his cooperation with prosecutors.    Mr. Boesky pleaded guilty in April to one felony and is cooperating in the government's investigation. He is scheduled to be sentenced in August and faces a maximum prison term of five years.    Federal Judge Milton Pollack said &quot;it is plainly ludicrous&quot; for Mr. Boesky to argue that three civil lawsuits brought against him by scores of his former limited partners should be put on hold until Mr. Boesky is sentenced in his criminal case. The suits, alleging securities fraud, seek the return of the partners' original $338 million investment in the Boesky partnership.    Mr. Boesky's lawyers had argued that because Mr. Boesky's plea agreement bars him from disclosing certain confidential information, Mr. Boesky would either have to violate that agreement in answering questions in the civil cases, thereby risking an unfavorable sentencing recommendation from prosecutors, or invoke the Fifth Amendment, handicapping his efforts to defend the civil cases. His lawyers said a further effect of allowing the cases to procede would be to discourage other wrongdoers from pleading guilty and cooperating with the government.    But Judge Pollack showed little sympathy for Mr. Boesky's plight. &quot;Mr. Boesky has sold himself to the prosecutors -- he hasn't given plaintiffs in the civil suits any consideration or favors,&quot; the judge wrote in a 16-page opinion. &quot;He has merchandised his knowledge of his misconduct and that of others for an exchange in which plaintiffs aren't partners, nor even parties.&quot;    Of the three suits subject to Judge Pollack's ruling, one was brought in March by 42 institutional investors, companies and individuals who contended that Mr. Boesky misled them in organizing his $1 billion investment partnership last year. Separate suits were brought by two other limited partners, Guinness PLC, a London food and liquor company, and Farnsworth andamp; Hastings Ltd., a Bermuda-based investment company.    Judge Pollack noted that neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor the U.S. attorney's office intervened to support Mr. Boesky's motion for delay, and concluded that &quot;the public interest in the integrity of securities markets militates in favor of the efficient and expeditious prosecution of these civil litigations.&quot; He added that he might later reevaluate the situation if required.    Theodore Levine, a lawyer at Wilmer, Cutler andamp; Pickering in Washington who is handling Mr. Boesky's civil litigation, said: &quot;We will respond and comply with the judge's ruling.&quot; Mr. Boesky's responses to the three complaints are due by the end of next week. </TEXT></DOC>
