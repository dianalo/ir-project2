(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   At the end, she was alone, hiding from theworld she'd shattered that day in wild gunfire. Outside, the tearsand trauma had just begun. Inside, Laurie Dann shot one last timeand her torment was over.   No one saw her place the .32-caliber revolver in her mouth orheard the shot that destroyed her demons and ended a day of terror.   Three weeks after she killed a young boy at Hubbard WoodsElementary School and ended her life in the house where she hadheld police at bay, authorities are still trying to piece togetherthe puzzle of Laurie Dann's life.   ``We want to answer the question why,'' said Winnetka Police Lt.Joseph Sumner. ``What made it happen? How did it happen? We owethat to the citizens and the community. We owe it to the familiesof victims. If you put yourself in their spot, you'd want to knowwhy.   ``It's very possible she may have taken that to the grave withher,'' he added. ``We can hopefully come down with a position of`This is probably why.'   Laurie Dann's road to tragedy was lined with signs of troubleahead, most posted in the last two years.   In that time, she was divorced, forced out of an apartment andcharged with shoplifting. She lied about her name, age andoccupation; she claimed to be a teacher or a journalism student.   She was suspected of making hundreds of harassing hang-up orthreatening phone calls to her ex-husband, his family and others.She was charged once, but the case was dropped due to insufficientevidence.   Students and officials at two schools say she hid raw meat underseat cushions, wore knit gloves when she ate, ran her shower forhours and rode an elevator day and night in her dormitory where shewas called ``psycho'' and ``elevator lady.''   ``She was definitely a very, very confused woman,'' Sumner said.   Dangerous, too, her ex-husband and others feared. But even asthey were contacting the FBI, prosecutors and police, several NorthShore families were unwittingly hiring Dann as a babysitter.   Two days before the May 20 tragedy, Arizona prosecutors wereready to charge Dann with making threatening phone calls to aformer boyfriend. Illinois authorities were working a similar case.The FBI was closing in, too.   They moved too late. By then, Dann had killed 8-year-oldNicholas Corwin. She shot five other children at the school and a20-year-old man who tried to disarm her when she burst into hisfamily's house. She barricaded herself there and committed suicide.   ``I don't see why this had to happen and get this far,'' SusanTaylor, her former sister-in law, said on ABC's ``Nightline.''Taylor said Dann called her hundreds of times, saying things like```Susie, Susie, Susie, you are going to die.'''   Dann, police say, left behind a trail of poison: 31 packets ofjuice and other foods, 29 of them contaminated with arsenic orlead, sent to her ex-husband, psychiatrist, families she workedfor, two Northwestern University fraternity houses and others.   Police believe she may once have known someone at the frathouses but don't know why she directed her poison at acquaintances,her gun at strangers.   It wasn't the only paradox in Dann's life.   Children she tended adored her, but adults came to fear her.   She was raised in a world of wealth and elegant homes, but sheleft rotting meat behind in one apartment with urine-stained floors.   Still, some say they detected no hint of growing fury.   ``She really was a pleasant ... quiet person. ... She wasn'tthis ghoulish person all her life,'' said Peter Solber, oneattorney who represented her in divorce proceedings. ``She wasn'tthe monster she turned out to be.''   For most of her 30 years, Laurie Dann lived an unremarkable life.   Laurie Wasserman, who had an older brother, Mark, graduated fromprestigious New Trier East High School. Her father, a successfulaccountant, and mother live in Glencoe on the North Shore, where$500,000 mansions, private beaches along Lake Michigan andthree-car garages are not uncommon.   In high school ``she was really quiet, kind of withdrawn. Sheheld her head low,'' said ex-classmate Margie Guiarelli. ``Therewas always kind of a wall in-between. ... She never really gave youeye contact. She was nervous when she talked to you.''   She took classes at four universities _ Drake, Arizona,Northwestern and Wisconsin-Madison _ over six years. At Arizona,she majored in home economics but did not graduate after fouryears. Later, she took courses in acting, dance and playwriting.   At Arizona, Dann pledged Alpha Delta Pi sorority, where sistersremembered her as introverted and recalled how she would makeseveral dates for one night, then cancel all but one.   ``I just perceived her to be a sweet little girl,'' DeniseShimer Janes, a former chapter president, told The Arizona Star.   For two years, Dann dated a premed student at Arizona, who laterclaimed she harassed him with threatening phone calls. His identityhas not been made public.   However, the man's friend, Louis Spivack, an Arizona prosecutorwho double-dated with them, remembers Dann as ``aloof, perhaps alittle unfriendly, possessive'' but exhibiting no especiallystrange behavior.   In 1982, two years after returning to the Chicago area, shemarried Russell Dann, who worked in his family's insurance firm.   Solber said his client, who was 5-foot-3, described herself andher husband as both ``little and cute. (She said) they looked likebrother and sister. That was her perception.''   The Danns bought a $275,000 home, but the marriage crumbled by1986. She saw a psychiatrist for part of their marriage.   Their parting was bitter. Dann, who had taken a marksmanshipcourse in her college days, bought a .357-caliber Magnum, sayingshe needed it for protection. A worried Russell Dann alertedpolice, who contacted her parents. Wasserman told officers the gunwould be locked in a safety deposit box.   The .357 was one of three guns she carried into the school.   Dann also accused her husband of assault, breaking into theirhome and setting it on fire, charges never substantiated.   Russell Dann, in turn, asserted she sneaked into his apartmentas he slept Sept. 30, 1986, and stabbed him in the chest with anice pick. He said he never saw his assailant and later claimed hisex-wife had admitted to the attack.   But Russell failed a lie detector test and refused to take asecond, while Laurie passed, said Michael Waller, assistant LakeCounty state's attorney.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
