Says Namibian Police Threaten Fair Elections</HEAD><BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A campaign of terror by the SouthAfrican-led police threatens free and fair independence elections inNamibia, the U.N. special representative for Namibia asserts.   Namibian police in armored cars mounted with heavy machine gunsreportedly drive through villages destroying crops and terrorizinginhabitants, the official, Martti Ahtisaari, wrote in a letterobtained Tuesday.   ``Their activities appear to have created an atmosphere of fearand intimidation among much of the population in the northernregion,'' he wrote Louis Pienaar, South Africa'sadministrator-general in Namibia.   The letter said a feared counterinsurgency unit called``Koevoet,'' Afrikaans for crowbar, is behind the terror campaign.   Ahtisaari sent the letter on June 9. No reply has been received,U.N. spokeswoman Nadia Younes said Tuesday.   Ahtisaari is leading a U.N. commission monitoring Pretoria'scooperation with a U.N.-mediated plan to free Namibia from 74 yearsof South African rule.   November elections for the territory's first black majority-ruledgovernment are scheduled under the independence plan.   Northern Namibia is the homeland of the Ovambo tribe, whichsupports the South-West Africa People's Organization, known as SWAPO.   The guerrilla movement, which led a 23-year bush war againstSouth African rule of Namibia, is expected to win the elections.Campaigning begins July 1. Many observers believe South Africa isactively trying to prevent SWAPO from winning a two-thirds majorityin the assembly by funding political parties and using the Koevoetpolice to intimidate SWAPO supporters.   Ahtisaari wrote that: ``the activities in which they (Koevoet)have been engaged render its members ... unfit for continued servicein the police during the transition period.''   ``The continuance of the situation ... raises grave doubt in mymind'' as to whether free and fair elections are possible, he wrote.</TEXT></DOC>
