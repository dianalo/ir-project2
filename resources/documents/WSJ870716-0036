The current Postal Service contracts are due to expire Monday at midnight, and the new development throws into turmoil talks that were expected to be relatively smooth. The contract in 1984 had to be settled by an arbitrator.    Moe Biller, president of the American Postal Workers Union, charged that postal officials made what he called an &quot;under-the-table deal&quot; with the Mail Handlers Union to reclassify jobs in an agency handbook so they would come under the smaller union's control.    The Postal Service and the Mail Handlers tentatively agreed on a contract Tuesday, but wouldn't reveal its terms. The Postal Service's chief negotiator, Thomas Fritsch, also refused to comment on Mr. Biller's charge, but said management is ready to bargain at any time.    There are about 50,000 Mail Handlers, most of whom work at loading and unloading mail at shipping docks. Postal Workers members, most of whom are clerks, and the National Association of Letter Carriers, which together include more than 500,000 members, are bargaining jointly with postal officials for a new three-year pact.    The postal unions aren't allowed to strike, under federal law, but Mr. Biller said arbitration and fact-finding processes are available as recourse. </TEXT></DOC>
