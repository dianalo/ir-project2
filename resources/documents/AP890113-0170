But the government also said it was confused by a report releasedby another U.S. agency with a contradictory view.   The Defense Department report, released Wednesday, listed theoutlawed African National Congress among 52 terrorist organizationsworldwide.   ``As far as the South African government is concerned, thePentagon report correctly analyzes terrorism,'' said ForeignMinister Pik Botha.   However, the U.S. Information Service in Pretoria released astatement from the State Department in Washington that contradictedthe Pentagon report.   ``The U.S. government has not determined that the ANC is aterrorist organization,'' said the statement prepared by the StateDepartment's Africa Affairs Bureau.   The State Department supported the ANC's aims of ending apartheidand establishing a democracy, but it disagreed with the ANC's use ofviolence, the statement said.   Apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 millionwhites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schoolsand health services.   Botha described the State Department statement as ``somewhatconfusing.'' He added, ``Nevertheless, the State Departmentacknowledges that the ANC's (violent) methods are unacceptable, andthis is the decisive issue.''   The Pentagon said its booklet, which included a foreword byPresident-elect George Bush, was prepared as a reference work _ notas a policy statement.   The booklet has prompted headlines in South African newspapersand angry condemnations of the United States by some anti-apartheidactivists and organizations.   Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the 1984 Nobel Peace Prizelaureate who says he supports the African National Congress' goalsbut opposes violence, said he was ``shocked and dismayed'' by theDefense Department report.   In Washington, a Pentagon spokesman said the group was includedin the book because authorities wanted to warn Americans of thedanger from the ANC and other organizations around the world. Thespokesman, Lt. Cmdr. Jim Kudla, said the book had been ``fullycoordinated'' with the State Department.   But within the State Department, counterterrorism officialsdisagreed with professional diplomats, who wrote the statementcontradicting the the Pentagon report and who are concerned withmaintaining ties to South Africa's black majority.   The South African government banned the African National Congressin 1960, and the group began a sabotage campaign one year later.There have been 180 bombings in South Africa during the 31-monthstate of emergency, killing 35 people and injuring at least 665 ofall races.   The government says it will not negotiate with the group unlessit renounces violence. The congress says it had no alternative butto take up arms after it was banned as a peaceful organization.</TEXT></DOC>
