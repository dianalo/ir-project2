The forum brought together various political parties, socialorganizations and fledgling pro-democracy movements into a councilof more than 40 that is to advise the interim government until freeelections in May.   After two hours of debate, participants decided to allow fivemore groups, including the official trade union federation, to takepart in the talks and granted observer status to four more.   The negotiators agreed to meet each Monday to proposelegislation and proposed that future discussions be carried live ontelevision and radio.   Hundreds of angry demonstrators disrupted the first hour of thesession, using bullhorns to shout their demands to be included andbanging on windows of the ground-floor conference room of theLutheran Church building where the talks were held.   ``Anyone who tries to force his participation in this way is notacting in the interests of democracy,'' President Manfred Gerlachsaid as the noise overwhelmed speakers.   The participants proposed a message of solidarity to PremierHans Modrow and West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who meetTuesday in Dresden.   They said the German-German summit expresses the will of bothnations to improve relations, but they warned against any movesthat would damage the sovereignty of either state _ a call to leavethe reunification issue off the agenda.   The meeting comes a day after the Communist Party concluded anemergency congress in which it embraced a multiparty system andchanged its name to the Socialist Unity Party of Germany-Party ofDemocratic Socialism.   The long title reflects both a new orientation to democraticprinciples and an eagerness to divorce itself from the corruptionand power abuses that tainted former Communist leaders ousted in apro-democracy movement that began in September.   New Communist Party leader Gregor Gysi and Wolfgang Berghofer,his chief deputy, opened the talks Dec. 7.   At that session, May 6 was set as the date for the first-evercompetitive elections to seat a new Parliament, kicking off avolatile campaign season likely to result in a minority role forthe Communists.   The talks have spurred the discredited Communists to consultwith their broadening opposition on how to run the country untilelections are held.   In his address Sunday to the congress' final session, Gysi setout a new course for the party that breaks with four decades ofStalinism.   Nearly 2,700 delegates unanimously approved the draft of a newstatute, to serve as the party rulebook until its next regularcongress, as well as the outlines of a new program.   The Communists were stripped of their constitutional mandate torule during a parliamentary session Dec. 1. It reduced their statusto that of any other political force, though the premier and muchof his Cabinet are Communist.   When a new Parliament is seated after elections, it in turn willname a new government.   The Communists polled only 12 percent support in a publicopinion survey conducted by major West German pollsters in earlyDecember, and Modrow himself has predicted his party could win nomore than 20 percent of the vote if elections were held now.   Two other political conventions were held over the weekend, bythe small Christian Democratic Union of East Germany that is aimingto win votes from the religious population, and by the oppositiongroup Democratic Awakening.   Despite the Communists' opposition to reunification, the themehas taken hold among some political groups.   Delegates at the founding party congress of Democratic Awakeningin Leipzig voted 350-35 with 21 abstentions that the right ofGerman unity should be inscribed in the East German constitution.   The Christian Democratic Union's leader, Lothar de Maiziere,told delegates he could envisage a single German state within aunited Europe.</TEXT></DOC>
