Contel, a holding company for local telephone concerns, said it expects to report an after-tax charge for the fourth quarter of between $108 million and $120 million, or $1.40 to $1.55 a share, from the equipment write-offs. The charge would lower 1987 earnings to between 95 cents and $1.05 a share, Contel said.    In addition, Contel would pay a pretax penalty of $13 million for the debt repayment. As previously reported, Contel is also expecting lower earnings for 1987 as a result of losing some U.S. government business and losses from Contel Executone, which sells equipment to small businesses that buy private phone systems. Executone is up for sale. In 1986, Contel had net income of $232.9 million, or $3.04 a share, on revenue of $3.07 billion.    The restructuring will help Contel ASC emphasize its international and data networks businesses, which were bolstered by acquisitions earlier this year, Contel said. The ASC unit, which is in the satellite and fiber-optic telecommunications business, agreed to acquire Equatorial Communications Co. for about $72 million and Communications Satellite Corp.'s VSAT and international businesses for about $38 million. VSAT links computers and their terminals, while Equatorial is a satellite data network concern.    The equipment write-down, which will improve cash flow, includes outdated telecommunications transmission equipment that has been supplanted by newer technology, Contel said. The equipment includes some satellite-related assets and analog equipment that has been replaced by digital transmission facilities. </TEXT></DOC>
