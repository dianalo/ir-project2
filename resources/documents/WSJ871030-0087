The felony charges, filed in U.S. District Court in Toledo, Ohio, accuse the two units of conspiring to allocate customers and fix prices in that portion of Ohio during 1981 and 1982.    Both companies agreed to pay the maximum $1 million fine.    Justice Department officials described the guilty pleas as an important first step in their nationwide probe of waste haulers.    While it has been known for months that several federal grand juries were investigating activities of Waste Management, Browning-Ferris and several of their units, yesterday's developments came as a surprise. Waste Management has consistently maintained it didn't violate any laws and strenuously resisted federal efforts to obtain a guilty plea.    The guilty pleas could provide federal prosecutors with a shot in the arm in two important ways. They suggest both companies were eager to avoid the risks of a trial. And as part of any plea agreement submitted for court approval, prosecutors are expected to demand cooperation from company officials in the 10 grand juries continuing to investigate industry practices from Florida to California.    The pleas follow similar antitrust charges filed by the Justice Department at the end of last month against a separate Waste Management subsidiary operating in South Florida. A Justice Department official said the company has indicated it plans to plead no contest to those charges. &quot;It would be inappropriate for us to comment until we plead,&quot; a spokesman for Waste Management said.    In the latest charges, the government accused Ohio Waste Systems Inc., the Waste Management unit, and Browning-Ferris Industries of Ohio and Michigan of conspiring to divide customers and submit &quot;collusive, noncompetitive and rigged bids&quot; to support secret agreements and inflate prices for trash hauling. In addition to federal prosecutors, at least two state attorneys general and the county of Los Angeles are also looking into Waste Management's operations.    In Oak Brook, Ill., a spokesman for Waste Management said the activities mentioned in the federal charges were &quot;isolated&quot; violations of company policy and &quot;shouldn't adversely reflect upon&quot; its &quot;otherwise exemplary performance&quot; in the Toledo area and throughout the U.S.    The company yesterday said it took action &quot;to discipline the employees&quot; involved, adding that it accepted the resignations of Richard Evenhouse, a former district manager in the Toledo area, and Jack Nichols, a former district marketing manager. Messrs. Evenhouse and Nichols couldn't be reached for comment.    In Houston, Browning-Ferris said the charges resulted from violations of its internal antitrust controls and involved &quot;unauthorized, spurious activity&quot; by a disgruntled former Toldeo district manager who later cooperated with the Justice Department and received immunity from prosecution.    Apart from the fines and public relations problems, the guilty pleas could subject both companies to state sanctions. At least 14 states -- including some of Waste Management's major business territories -- have laws that make it possible for corporations convicted of antitrust violations to be barred from doing business within the state's boundaries. </TEXT></DOC>
