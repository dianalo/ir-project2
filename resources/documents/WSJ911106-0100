They predicted the system wouldsave billions of dollars a year.   Gathering for a closed-door meeting at the invitation ofHealth and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan, chiefexecutives of major insurance companies and representativesof physicians' and hospital associations said their goal wasto come up with a system that would allow doctors andhospitals to file standardized claim forms by computer to anyinsurance company or the government. They also envisioned acomputerized data base that would allow authorizedhealth-care providers to obtain the health records ofpatients.</LP><TEXT>   It's clear the effort won't bear fruit any time soon.Participants in yesterday's meeting set no deadline, nor didthey say who would pay for the undertaking. But theypredicted that the money saved by eliminating theadministrative burdens posed by heaps of paperwork anddifferent forms would result in lower health-care fees forpatients.   &quot;Eventually, to receive care, every American patient willneed only to present a health insurance card issued by aprivate or government plan to a hospital or doctor,&quot; Dr.Sullivan said at a news conference following the meeting.Also he said, patients would not &quot;have to remember and repeattheir medical history as they move from internist tospecialist . . . . Ultimately patients should not have tofill out insurance forms.&quot;   Some studies suggest that administrative costs accountedfor as much as $100 billion of the $670 billion spent onhealth care in the U.S. last year. Government officialscontend the figure is far lower, probably around $20 to $50billion, but they agree that high overhead is contributing toescalating health costs.   The human services department drew some criticism becauseconsumer groups weren't invited to yesterday's meeting. &quot;Ifthe government is trying to find out what's going on, itshould look at all points of view,&quot; said Edwin Rothschild, aspokesman a Citizen Action, a group that tried unsuccessfullyto gain access to the meeting. &quot;It shouldn't sit down in aclosed-door meeting and then come out and say this is what wedecided.&quot;   Dr. Sullivan replied that the session was intended tofocus on narrow, technical issues, &quot;not to engage in anideological debate.&quot;   A majority of hospitals and nearly half of all doctors nowfile claims by computer to Medicare, the federal healthinsurance program for the elderly and disabled, officialssaid. Some private insurance companies also have computerizedarrangements with health-care providers. But some physicansare wary of electronic processing because the computerequipment is expensive. Dr. Sullivan also acknowledged thatsetting up a computerized pool of patient records could raiseconcerns about patients' privacy, but he vowed to ensureconfidentiality.</TEXT></DOC>
