Several publishing industry vendors made their productannouncements at PC Expo, having evidently withheld them at Comdex.andM;It seems to us that Spring Comdex may be declining in stature from a nationalshow to a regional show-albeit still a very large regional show.andP;  At the sametime, PC Expo, which has been regarded as only a regional show, seems to haverisen at least to the stature of `major regional' and perhaps even tomajor-league standing.andM;Comdex was founded as a show for computer retailers and VARs, while PC Expohas tried to position itself as the show for `volume buyers.' We wonderwhether the exhibitors' decisions about where to spend their marketingdollars was due to chance, to the show organizers' persuasive powersrespectively or to a shift in distribution patterns for PC products.andM;Fonts on the fly, from buzzword to paperandM;Facelift and ATM for Windows.andP;  Adobe demonstrated Adobe Type Manager forWindows.andP;  It is quite like the Macintosh product (see Vol.andP;  4, No.andP;  4, p. 24)in most respects.andP;  In some ways, it is better.andP;  It takes only 60K of memory(plus user-settable cache) versus about 100K on the Mac.andP;  You can put yourfont outlines into any directory; the WIN.INI file tells Windows where tolook for them.andP;  The Mac requires them to be in the system folder.andM;ATM for Windows creates bitmaps only for characters you actually request,rather than an entire font at a time.andP;  This means that there may be pauseswhenever you type a character that isn't in the cache, but they will be briefandM;Bitstream unveiled a competing product called FaceLift, which should be indistribution by the end of summer.andP;  Based on the Speedo rasterizer, it doespretty much the same thing as ATM.andP;  However, it uses only 20K of memory (pluscache), which should be a significant advantage.andM;PostScript printer support is another area where the two rasterizers differ.andO;Adobe uses its own Type I outlines, which can be downloaded to any PostScriptprinter that uses an Adobe controller and to an increasing number of newclones that can accept Type 1 fonts.andP;  But lots of existing clones can't.andM;Bitstream has a utility program that can convert a Type 1 font into theSpeedo format, so you can use Adobe fonts if you have them.andP;  FaceLift alsocomes with Bitstream's width-compatible versions of the basic 35 faces.andP;  Alookup table matches the Bitstream font name with the Adobe/Linotype fontname, so you can use Bitstream faces on the screen with a printer that has anAdobe PostScript controller.andP;  The lookup table is handy for reformatting adocument with a different printer driver because it translates the fonts inthe document, e.g., Tms Rmn to Times, or Atech's Marin to Times.andM;For non-PostScript printers, you have a choice of making downloadable fontsahead of time (faster printing but time-and disk-consuming) or making fontson the fly and sending the page to the printer as a graphic.andP;  Bitstream saysthe quality is the same, and recommends making fonts in the typical copysizes 6-14+ and using on-the-fly fonts for headlines, etc.andM;On the low-cost front.andP;  Atech has upgraded its scalable font package,Publisher's Powerpak, to a somewhat respectable level of quality.andP;  Thispackage does not include the ability to make downloadable fonts, opting tohandle its characters only as graphics.andP;  The competitive part is the price of$79.95 for three families--Cobb (Courier), Marin (Times) and Dixon(Helvetica)-in normal, bold, italic, bold-italic, hollow, compressed,semi-compressed, expanded and semi-expanded type.andM;The previous version of Publisher's Powerpak users to make screen fonts,which are now generated on the fly.andP;  The current program is great fordot-matrix/laser/typeset interchangeability, because you don't have to matchfonts.andP;  It's easy to use and requires very little memory and disk space.andO;Additional font families cost $29.95 (Atech) and $79.95 (foreign andMonotype).andP;  There are four versions, one each for Windows, WordPerfect,Ventura and First Publisher.andM;Atech Software, 5964 La Place Court, Suite 125, Carlsbad, CA 92008; phone(800) 748-5657andM;Note that many of the newer low-end publishing packages, such as Avagio (fromUnison World, a subsidiary of Kyocera) and Express Publisher (from Power UpSoftware), are including their own scalable fonts, bypassing the traditionalneed to purchase or make fonts.andM;Save a tree...andP;  With all of the font enhancements coming to HP LaserJets,scaling the entire page is still impossible without PostScript-or a utilityprogram called TreeSaver from Discoversoft.andP;  The product can scale two orfour pages down to print on one letter-size sheet, or any other size, such asa DayTimers book.andP;  It is also intended for wide spreadsheets or databasereports.andP;  It costs $89.95.andM;Discoversoft, 1516 Oak St., Alameda, CA 94501; phone (415) 769-2902, fax769-0149andM;Screen font hardware.andP;  ATI, which claims to be the second-largest maker ofvideo cards for PCs, has entered the font fray with Crystal Fonts.andP;  UnlikeSpeedo, ATM, Nimbus Q and TrueType fonts, Crystal Fonts are generated by thedisplay card's hardware and use gray-scale anti-aliasing.andM;Putting the font rasterizer on the card means that there is no perceptibledelay in generating a new screen bitmap.andP;  ATI quotes rasterizing times of2,400 characters per second, and up to 40,000 cps fetching characters fromthe on-board cache.andP;  In contrast, Speedo and ATM run at less than 400 cps ona fast 386 machine and proportionally slower on AT-class machines.andM;Anti-aliasing (that is, smoothing the jaggies on a bitmap) was invented inthe '70s at the MIT Mecha Lab.andP;  The idea is that you really want to show apartial pixel, so you substitute a gray pixel.andP;  The ATI hardware picks one of16 gray shades based on how much of each pixel is inside the font outline.andO;The resulting characters look somewhat fuzzy if you get close, but at normalviewing distances they arc quite legible (see photos).andP;  Graphic designers whoneed to judge the &quot;color of the page&quot; will be pleased.andM;The ATI card's disadvantages are twofold.andP;  First, you will pay a bit more forthe display card; prices start at $699 for an 8514/A-compatible card (16colors, 1024 x 768 pixels, interlaced display) and go up to $1,299 (256colors, 1024 x 768 pixels non-interlaced, register compatible with VGA, EGAHercules).andP;  Second, the bitmaps are only for the screen; you can't use themon dot-matrix or LaserJet-class printers.andP;  ATM and Speedo may be slower, butthey are more general.andM;At least you won't have to buy yet another set of font outlines.andP;  ATI has autility that can convert Bitstream faces to its own format, and it plans tosupport Adobe, Agfa Compugraphic and TrueType formats as well.andM;PostScript for HP LaserJets, even the IIandM;Series II PostScript from Adobe.andP;  For several years Hewlett-Packard LaserJetSeries Il customers have been searching for an honest-to-goodness, simple andinexpensive PostScript option.andP;  Hopes were raised when HP began offeringPostScript cartridges for the IIP, IID and III.andP;  But HP has all but forgottenits Series II customers in favor of the more advanced III.andP;  Pacific Datareleased a cartridge, now $495 (see Vol.andP;  4, No.andP;  10), but it requires 2.5 MBof printer memory.andM;Adobe may have the best deal yet by offering a PostScript cartridge thatneeds only 1 MB of printer memory-you need that much to print a full page ofgraphics at 300 dpi anyhow.andP;  The Adobe cartridge, which uses the ATMrasterizer, will be available in late July, also for $495.andM;PostScript: two for II.andP;  Gradco Systems, distributors ofpaper/envelope-feeding devices for laser printers, was showing its upgrade toTurboPrint, a PostScript controller and accelerator for  286 and  386 PCs.andO;It supports the LaserJet, Plus, 500, Series II, IID and III as well as theCanon LBP-811, Brother HL-8e or any Canon SX/CX engine.andP;  According to Gradco,an hour print job has been cut to 10 minutes and the Ventura Scoop page on a 286 12 MHZ PC prints in 20 seconds instead of 5 minutes.andP;  We tried aPageMaker document while in the booth at Comdex and it printed very quickly,as promised.andM;The board comes with a non-upgradable 2.5 MB of DRAM (Gradco says there is noreason ever to add more), eliminating the need to supplement printer memory.andO;The controller's language interpreter, ConoScript, is based on Conographictechnology and uses a proprietary 32-bit micro-processor.andP;  Gradco claims thatthe controller is fully compatible with the PostScript language and poses nofont compatibility problems when switching to another PostScript printer orimagesetter.andP;  It supports Bitstream font packages.andM;As for sprucing up the output quality, Gradco claims it has enhanced the fontoutlines to provide better appearance at 300 x 300 dpi rather than trying toboost resolution.andP;  TurboPrint is available for $1,195.andM;Gradco Systems, 7 Morgan, Irvine, CA 92718; phone (714) 454-0108, (800)628-1538.andM;Bell andamp; Howell Quintar announced its Q-Script laser printer controller cardfor the HP Laserjet Series II andamp; III, Canon LBP-8II, Brother HL-8e, ToshibaPageLaser 12, and Ricoh PC Laser 6000/EX.andP;  Processing is done in theback-ground using PhoenixPage implementation of PostScript or emulations ofPCL 3, Toshiba P321SL and IBM ProPrinter XL24 for non-PostScriptapplications.andP;  According to the manufacturer, it has a 50-MHz, 32-bitgraphics processor (a TMS34010) for fast PostScript language rasterizing.andO;The controller does not increase the resolution of the host printer.andP;  TheQ-Script board (with 3 MB standard, up to 7 MB available), printer board,video cable, software and the 35 standard typefaces (it supports additionalBitstream fonts) is available now for $2,295.andM;Like the Eicon Technologics board (see Vol.andP;  3, No.andP;  9), the Q-Script boardcan print without the attention of the PC's central processor.andP;  It can accessthe PC disk on its own when it needs font outlines.andP;  Application software cantreat the card as an LPT: port; the card will gobble up all the print codesand then go off on its own to rasterize the data, while you can go back tousing your computer without waiting for the printer.andP;  The Q-Script card willalso let another PC send data to the printer independently, even while it israsterizing your file.andP;  The card can also be placed in a network file serverto handle even more users.andM;Bell andamp; Howell Quintar Company, 370 Amapola Ave., Suite 106, Torrance, CA90501; phone (213) 320-5700, fax 618-1282.andM;Full spectrum of color printersandM;Color PostScript printer under $7,000.andP;  Seiko introduced the lowest-priced300-dpi color PostScript printer to date, nosing out the new $7,995 TektronixPhaser PX we reported last month.andP;  The Seiko ColorPoint PS printer is offeredin two page sizes: 8 1/2&quot; x 11&quot; for $6,995 and 11&quot; x 17&quot; for $9,999.andP;  Bothmodels use the Intel 80960 RISC chip and cart print on paper ortransparencies.andP;  They use Seiko's own thermal transfer print engine and thePhoenixPage PostScript interpreter, and they support Adobe Type 1,HP-compatible soft fonts and Bitstream fonts.andM;The letter-size unit weighs 40 pounds and has a smaller footprint (17&quot; x 14&quot;x 8.1&quot;) than any direct competitor.andP;  Seiko also claims to deliver the largestprintable image area (8.25&quot; x 10.7&quot; and 10.75&quot; x 16.6&quot;) on the finished cutsheet by using its rollfed double cutter.andP;  A &quot;supersize media&quot; optionproduces 8.53&quot; x 11.9&quot; and 11.7&quot; x 17.9&quot; pages for bleeds.andM;The controller contains 6 MB of RAM and five standard interfaces: AppleTalkCentronics, RS-232 and two SCSI.andP;  Seiko has obtained color certification fromPantone for both models.andP;  They are slated to be shipped in August.andM;Seiko Instruments Graphic Devices, 1130 Ringwood Court, San Jose, CA 95131;phone (408) 922-5800, fax 922-5840.andM;Somewhat higher on the price scale is NEC's 300-dpi, 8 1/2&quot; x 11&quot; ColormatePS thermal transfer printer.andP;  Based on a 68020 processor and an AdobePostScript interpreter, it outputs to paper and transparencies and cansimulate Pantone's colors.andP;  Its rated speed is one full-color page perminute.andM;The standard configuration includes 8 MB of RAM, five interfaces (RS-232,Rs-422, LocalTalk, Centronics parallel and SCSI) and 35 Adobe fonts.andP;  TheSCSI interface can connect to an optional 20-MB hard disk; the printer comeswith screen versions of all resident fonts for Mac or Windows.andP;  Configurationselections are made on a front LCD panel.andP;  Three ribbons are available: thefour-color one gives 150 CMYK color pages, the three-color ribbon gives 215pages using a process black and the black ribbon gives 480 pages.andP;  Availablenow, the Colormate PS lists for $9,995.andM;The newest entrant to the field is Hitachi's VY-5000 printer.andP;  We are notvery impressed by this unit for several reasons.andP;  First, it has only 155-dpiresolution.andP;  This is not too bad for scanned images, since each pixel willcarry 24 bits of color.andP;  But it is awful for text.andP;  Second, the VY-5000 willbe priced high, around $17,000 for the letter-size machine.andP;  Finally, Hitachi seems to be taking a lackadaisical attitude toward obtaining aPostScript controller for the engine, although we view that as a necessity.andM;Hitachi has contracted with TeleTypesetting, Inc., for its PostScriptemulation.andP;  TTS is a tiny firm, albeit one with deep roots in the graphicarts.andP;  Its experience in writing interpreters is limited to a series ofmodules that convert PostScript into codes for obsolete typsetters and aPostScript screen previewer for the Macintosh.andP;  We have great respect for theTTS programmers, but this will be the first color interpreter the firm hasdone; delays and bugs are almost inevitable.andP;  Hitachi seems not at allworried; if it's not ready by Comdex, we were told, maybe it will be done byyear end.andP;  We hope the market will wait.andM;Scanners: more optionsandM;Full-page hand scanner with document feeder.andP;  We discovered a handy scannerfrom Lightspeed Technology at Comdex.andP;  The 400-dpi Lightscan 400P is the onlyhand-held scanner we've seen that is wide enough to scan an 8 1/2&quot;-wide pagein one step (maximum page length is 14&quot;).andP;  Moreover, the scanner can beplaced into the independent document feeder, which holds up to 10 pages.andP;  Wehave not recommended hand scanners for OCR because of the small scanning areaand registration problems, but this unit may have those shortcomings licked.andO;In addition, many of the $2,000 + flatbed scanners do not have documentfeeders.andP;  You can tote this unit along (without the document feeder) in yourbriefcase or scan multiple pages unattended in the document feeder.andM;Usable with PCs or Macs, the Lightscan 400P features 64 levels of grayscaledata.andP;  Adjustinent software for contrast and brightness is included.andM;The Lightscan 400P seems to fill the niche for people who want portabilityand OCR capability and do not want to spend the money for a flatbed unit.andO;The scanner is currently available with the document feeder for $795.andM;Lightspeed Technology, c/o Computer Friends, 14250 NW Science Park Dr.,andO;Portland, OR 97229,- phone (503) 626-2291, fax 643-5379.andM;Help for hand scanning.andP;  Computer Aided Technology was showing some usefulscanning aids.andP;  Typically, hand scanner users avoid scanning images largerthan 4&quot; wide; existing ways to piece together separate scans have beenimprecise at best.andP;  A clever utility from CAT, ImageLinks, merges halves of ahand-scanned image using horizontal registration bars to compensate forskewing, different contrasts and changes in speed (see photo).andP;  It supportsTIFF, PCX, grayscale and scaled PCX halftone format conversion.andP;  You can cropand size the image using aspect ratio control, auto-proportion andautoscaling.andP;  ImageLinks retails for $195.andM;The CAT ScanAdapter LPT is a palm-size unit that provides a parallelinterface controller for attaching a scanner to a PC (particularly a laptop)without a slot.andP;  It includes a 12V power adapter so you can take your OCR onthe go to the library or business meetings.andP;  The device comes with CAT ImageEnhancer utility software for $149.andP;  (Will the availability of portable OCRincrease plagiarism?)andM;Computer Aided Technology, 7411 Hines Place, Suite 212, Dallas, TX 75235;phone (214) 631-6688, fax 631-4059.andM;Color at hand.andP;  Migraph introduced a hand-held color scanner.andP;  It offers upto 400-dpi resolution, settable on the scanner in 10-dpi jumps, across afour-inch scan window.andP;  But the color fidelity is only four bits (16 levels)per color.andP;  Migraph, unsurprisingly, prefers to state that it delivers 4,096colors (12 bits total).andP;  Supporting software will be offered for both PCplatforms and the Commodore Amiga.andP;  It will save images in PC TIFF or PCXformats and IFF on the Amiga.andM;Although Migraph's press handout spoke of &quot;dramatic price/performance ratio,&quot;the firm had set neither price nor schedules shipping date as we went topress.andM;Migraph, 200 South 33rd St., Suite 220, Federal Way, WA 98003; phone (206)838-4677, fax 838-4702.andM;No host required.andP;  Regent Peripherals' ScanStation 4000 has a built-in286-based host computer with 2 MB of RAM, a 40-MB hard disk and a 5 1/4&quot;floppy drive.andP;  The 400-dpi scan element can perceive 256 levels of grayscaledata; image editing software is included.andP;  The unit features two RS-232ports, two parallel ports, two serial ports, and one Hercules monochromevideo port.andP;  Hardware options include several other types of video drivers.andO;A sheet-feeder, which would make OCR, work easier, is due by year's end.andM;At $4,495, the ScanStation 4000 is in the same price ballpark as anequivalent separate computer and scanner; the convenience of built-in onlineprocessing helps it to stand out.andP;  Regent Peripherals, 901 Rainier Ave. N.,andO;Suite B202, Renton, NAA 98055; phone (206) 772-0613; fax 772-1047.andM;OCR: better hardware, new softwareandM;Xerox Imaging Systems' Kurzweil division showed a prerelease version of theK5200 intelligent character recognition system, which (initially, at least)will complement rather than replace XIS's K5100 product.andP;  Based on the samescanner, the 5200 puts the character recognition smarts on a RISC-based boardthat is housed in a separate box with a SCSI interface; the 5100 uses anAT-bus board.andM;The 5200 enjoys several advantages over the 5100: it is significantly faster,has more connectivity options (thanks to the SCSI interface), offers betterrecognition of draft dot-matrix text and can save files in additional formats(including our in-house favorite, XyWrite).andP;  The user can also see a largerportion of the document image while examining characters in the&quot;verification&quot; (training) mode.andM;Scheduled for a June release, the 5200 will sell for $19,500, only $2,000more than the 5100.andP;  If XIS keeps selling the older unit, we anticipatechange in the relative pricing of the two.andM;Meanwhile, high-end OCR, vendors have realized that the low end of the marketis booming.andP;  Kurzweil recently entered the software-only recognition fieldwith Discover Freedom 386 ($2,995).andP;  In June, Kurzweil's traditional rival,Calera Recognition Systems, also moved into the software market.andM;Calera is introducing several products.andP;  WordScan ($595) and WordScan Plus($995) both run on ATs or PS/2s.andP;  The Plus version offers such enhancementsas image display during verification; automatic processing of multiple jobs;and the ability to apply  style sheets' with which the operator can overridea document's existing layout.andP;  Also available are WordScan Plus/AT and /MCA($3,995 each), which enable background scanning and faster throughput byadding a coprocessor board.andM;Caere, which has trod the middle ground by offering both software-only andcoprocessor-based systems, met the high-end incursion by reducing the priceof OmniPage '286 from $1,995 to $1,295.andP;  Ibis package comprises software andan AT-bus coprocessor board.andM;Hardware, software face off.andP;  Systems from the first echelon of OCR products(software-only) are facing ever-greater battles against products from thesecond echelon (those that include processing hardware but no scanner).andP;  Forinstance, OmniPage '286 now lists for only 30% more than WordScan Plus;meanwhile, the list price of WordScan Plus/AT or /MCA is only 25% higher thanthat of Discover Freedom 386.andP;  The hardware-based products are generallyclaimed to be faster, but the newest generation of software may boastenhanced features.andM;We will take closer looks at leading new OCR products, and at high-endsystems, in an upcoming issue of this Report.andM;Other OCR news.andP;  OCR Systems showed ReadRight Personal, a hand scannerversion of its omnifont page recognition software.andP;  Slated to be shipped inJuly, ReadRight Personal ($249) will feature page decomposition (automaticseparation of text from graphics).andP;  Also coming from OCR Systems this summerwill be ReadRight for Windows ($595).andM;Olduvai announced Read-It OCR 2.0  (regular version $495, hand-scannerversion $249), which will run on '286 and '386 PCs under Microsoft Windows2.1 and 3.0.andP;  In addition to offering increased speed and accuracy, Olduvaisays that the new release will take advantage of all extended and expandedmemory, contain new file formats (such as WordPerfect and WordStar) and addscanner drivers.andM;Rank and file managementandM;Wang Informatics, a subsidiary of Wang Laboratories, announced a documentmanager called Profound, designed to access documents anywhere on awidely-distributed network.andP;  &quot;On a large, busy network,&quot; Bob Borgmeyer,president and CEO of Wang Informatics, explained, &quot;it can be hard enough tofind your own work, let alone someone else's.andP;  Profound solves that problem,and in addition, provides automatic backup and redundancy.&quot;andM;Profound, which was originally developed for lawyers, builds an internalstructure of &quot;library cards&quot; allowing access to all of the documents andfiles on the network.andP;  It automatically updates the library card whenever adocument is created or edited.andP;  It then automatically backs up anddistributes files across the network.andP;  Profound provides the ability toaccess up to 99 revision levels of a single document.andP;  It can search up to 18different fields on a library card, such as author, date, client anduser-defined comments and keywords.andM;Wang Informatics, 2111 East Higland Ave., Phoenix, AZ 85016; phone (602)224-0855.andM;Charisma for WindowsandM;Micrografx unveiled a business graphics program that combines draw-programfeatures with data-driven graphics  spread-sheet graphs) and word charts.andO;Called Charisma, it runs under Windows/286, Windows/386 or Windows 3.0.andP;  Withit, Micrografx intends to challenge Microsoft PowerPoint, Lotus Freelance andHarvard Graphics.andM;Like a drawing program, it supports rectangles, ellipses, polygons, arcs andfines.andP;  It also handles Bezier curves, and can transform polygons intoBezier-defined &quot;puddles&quot;; the vertices of the polygon become the controlpoints of the Bezier curves.andP;  The package includes a clip-art library of2,200 business symbols.andM;It offers styled text: you can mix fonts (Charisma supports Fontware, Speedoand Nimbus Q outlines), sizes and styles within a single text object.andP;  Textcan be anamorphically scaled and can be rotated in Vio-degree increments.andO;Text can also be converted into Bezier curves for further manipulation.andM;It also has many of the features of a slide-making package: device driversfor popular slide recorders, customizable templates and the ability to usegraphic objects as &quot;bullets.&quot; It has a slide-show utility with 20 wipes,fades and dissolves.andP;  It supports 24-bit color with CYMK, RGB and HLS colorpickers.andP;  It also offers Windows DDE links to imported spreadsheet data.andM;Charisma will be priced at $495, and will be shipped to dealers later thissummer.andM;Windows dressingandM;Amid all of the hype for Windows 3.0, two products were on hand that furtherenhanced the new and improved Windows.andP;  From Broderbund, Prompt (updated forWindows 3.0) offers a more versatile file manager that graphically displayscomplete directory trees, file sizes and can compress files.andP;  Users canquickly preview multiple graphics files just by clicking the filename.andM;HDC Computer Corporation has two Windows add-ons, Windows Express andFirstApps.andP;  Windows Express users can create &quot;work set folders&quot; and menusthat offer more advanced ways to organize applications and files.andP;  FirstAppsprovides a host of utilities from customizable screen savers and backgroundsto autosave and font viewer.andP;  Both retail for $99.95andM;HDC Computer Corporation, 6742 185th Ave. NE, Redmond, WA 98052; phone (800)321-4606.andM;Multifunction fax machinesandM;Fax machines are quickly gaining new powers.andP;  New units use existingtechnologies, such as scanning, in more useful ways.andM;A facsimile machine can now be linked to PCs and networks as a scanner orfile transmitter and can output to laser printers (the end of unwritable faxpaper!).andP;  New fax technology allows for confidential protection, storingtransmissions until a password releases them.andP;  Benefits include quickertransmission, instant onscreen viewing (no more waiting for the printout),the ability to send documents to mailing lists and to delay transmissionuntil phone rates go down, and so forth.andM;These machines come in many variations.andP;  Murata has an ordinary-lookingsheet-fed fax machine that scans text (for OCR) or graphics, sends files viamodem, outputs to plain paper and can even be used as an ordinary fax.andP;  ECACandamp;C Products was demonstrating the Bona Lan-Fax and the Bona 4-in-1 Machine,a flatbed scanner/fax/copier.andP;  Wordcraft is marketing a software package thatconverts the Canon FAX-L770 into a laser printer and scanner.andP;  Other firmshave controller cards for a network or host PC.andM;File conversionandM;White Crane Systems, developer of The Brooklyn Bridge file transfer utility,has released AutoWord 1.0 ($149.95), which translates formatting, graphicsand spreadsheet data from one word processor to another.andP;  The package allowsword processing documents and graphics files to he viewed fully formattedprior to translation, even on monochrome monitors.andP;  It will automaticallydetect the file format type of the input file.andM;AutoWord 1.0 supports such popular word processing packages as Microsoft'sWord and Word for Windows; WordPerfect, Versions 4.X and 5.X; WordStar andWordStar Professional; PFS:Write; PFS:First Choice; Multimate; IBM'sDisplayWrite, Versions 2, 3 and 4, and IBM Writing Assistant; XyWrite;Volkswriter; MacWrite II; and Samna Word and Ann.andP;  Other supported textformats and packages include intelligent ASCII, Navy DIF; DCA/RFT; DCA/FFT;DEC WPS Plus/DX; Wang PC; Total Word; Lotus 1-2-3; Smart; Enable andMicrosoft's RTF.andM;It supports leading graphics formats such as PC Paintbrush (PCX); WindowsPaint (MSP); TIFF; PICT; and Word-Perfect's WPG.andM;AutoWord also includes printer drivers for several industry standardprinters.andP;  This allows document and graphic files to he printed from withinAutoWord on any printer supporting Epson, PostScript or HP LaserJetemulation.andM;White Crane Systems, 6400 Atlantic Blvd., Suite 180, Norcross, Georgia 30071;phone (800) 344-6783 or (404) 446-0660.andM;In a class by themselvesandM;Modular keyboard.andP;  You may have seen ads for Datadesk's modular keyboard.andO;Called the Switchboard, it comprises multiple keypads (for the QWERTY group,cursor arrows, function keys and so on) that you can select and arrange in avariety of ways.andP;  You can put the arrow keys to the left of the main typinggroup while keeping the numeric keypad on your right, or vice versa.andP;  Youcould have function keys at the left or across the top-or both.andP;  Lefties cando it the opposite way.andM;One of the modules is a trackball; Datadesk told us that it is the sametrackball used in the Mac Portable.andP;  Another is a 24-key bank for 3270emulation; when it is used in normal Mac or PC software, these 24 keys behavelike regular F-keys with the shift or control keys pressed.andP;  This would begreat for programs that, like XyWrite, are entirely keystroke driven.andP;  Itwould also support lots of macros.andM;The keyboard supports both Macintosh and PC computers.andP;  At the flip of aswitch, it can emit Apple Desktop Bus codes or AT scan codes.andP;  This could bea boon to those who work at both kinds of computer.andP;  You would only have toget used to the feel and layout of one keyboard.andM;When we first started seeing Datadesk's ads, we applauded the concept butwondered how wen executed it was.andP;  Would the completed keyboard look likeFrankenstein's monster, with the seams still showing? Actually, it's prettystylish.andP;  Would the keys have a good feel for touch typing? Yes, if you likethe clicky-clicky feel of the IBM keyboard.andP;  Would the unit be strong enoughto be held on a typist's knees and to survive being taken home every night?andO;We won't know until we've worked with one for a few days, but the answer willprobably turn out to be yes.andM;Datadesk has just begun shipping Switchboards.andP;  The price depends on how manymodules you install; a typical unit with the QWERTY, arrow- and numeric keyswould cost $239.andP;  An AT-style function key module adds $49.andM;Datadesk, 9314 Eton Ave., Chatsworth, CA 91311; phone (818) 9984200, fax998-0330.andM;High compression engine.andP;  Infochip demonstrated a coprocessor chip, theIC-105, that can compress and decompress data at Winchester-disk speeds.andO;Compression ratios up 15:1 are possible, the company claimed.andP;  Unlike theJPEG compression chips we have discussed in recent months, the IC-105 giveslossless compression; the transformation is perfectly reversible.andP;  It can beused to compress data as it is being written to disk, for example, and todecompress it as it is being read.andM;Such a chip, if built into the disk controller card, could multiply theeffective size of your disk drive; on an Ethernet or Token Ring adapter, itwould multiply the effective bandwidth of your network.andP;  (Note, though, thatmost 9600bps modems already incorporate data compression.) It's not all thatexpensive, either: in thousand-piece quantities, the chip costs about $80.andM;Infochip Systems, 2840 San Tomas Expressway, Santa Clara, CA 95051; phone(408) 727-0514.andM;Two for the road.andP;  Two companies, Zirco (PowerTrip) and StatpowerTechnologies (Pocket Power Inverter), were showing palm-size devices thatconvert 12V car socket to 120V Ac house current.andP;  The new part was PowerTripInternational from Zirco which works with all 220 volt equipment.andM;Statpower Technologies, 170-717 Simundson Dr., Point Roberts, NAA 98281;phone (604) 420-1585, fax (604) 420-5941.andM;Zirco, 10900 W 44th Ave., Wheat Ridge, CO 80033; phone (303) 421-2013, fax(303) 423-8346.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
