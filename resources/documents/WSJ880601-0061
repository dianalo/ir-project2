Until recently, economists generally expected retail food prices to rise 3% to 4% this year. But if this spring's dry weather turns into a drought, says Vincent Malanga, president of LaSalle Economics Inc., it could reduce crop yields so much that by autumn the inflation figure may hit 7% to 8%.    Three big farm states -- Iowa, Illinois and Indiana -- have had their driest spring since the Dust Bowl year of 1934, says Peter Leavitt of Weather Services Corp., Bedford, Mass. Most forecasters expect the hot, dry weather to continue for several weeks.    &quot;We think food can be a major catalyst of inflation in 1989,&quot; Mr. Malanga said.    The dry weather and growing fears of shortages are already setting off inflation alarms. Farm prices, buoyed by rallying hog and soybean prices, rose 3.1% in May alone, according to figures released yesterday by the Agriculture Department.    The Commodity Research Bureau futures price index rose 2.3% yesterday, the largest one-day percentage gain by the widely watched inflation indicator since 1979. The index is weighted toward agricultural commodities.    Speculation that cash prices will climb even higher has pushed soybean futures prices to their highest level in four years. Many contracts rose 30 cents a bushel yesterday, the daily limit permitted on the Chicago Board of Trade, after weather forecasts showed little chance of significant rain this week in the Midwest. Corn and wheat futures prices also rose sharply.    Although it would take several months for a drought to affect most retail food costs, some are already rising, especially for foods tied to soybeans. The cash price of soybeans, the actual price that food companies pay, has jumped 28% so far this year at some Illinois grain elevators. Kraft Inc. boosted the price of its margarine, mayonnaise and salad dressing containing soybean oil by 5% to 10% in January and February.    The rising cost of soybean meal, which is used in livestock feeds, is squeezing the profit margins of many poultry producers. Feed accounts for roughly half the cost of raising chickens.    A food-inflation revival would change the role of food prices, which had acted as a major restraint of overall inflation in recent years. In 1987, U.S. food prices rose only 3.5%.    Donald Ratajczak, director of economic forecasting at Georgia State University, has been projecting that a soybean yield this year of roughly 30 bushels an acre would produce a crop large enough to keep food prices in 1989 from rising more than 4%. However, food prices would probably jump 6% to 7% next year if dry weather were to halve soybean output, he says.    Many grain analysts and economists have resisted trimming their crop estimates because most of the corn and soybean crop was planted only recently. Rainfall usually doesn't determine a crop yield until summer. But farm experts now figure that the dry weather has lasted almost long enough to start cutting into yields.    If dry weather cuts normal production by just three bushels an acre, the nation's soybean stockpiles could evaporate by next year, says Richard Loewy, senior grain and oilseed analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. With normal yield, the September 1989 soybean stockpile was expected to total 145 million bushels.    &quot;It is finger-biting time,&quot; Mr. Ratajczak said. &quot;The clock will start in two weeks' time on knocking down yield estimates.&quot;    The bond and stock markets ignored the soaring grain-futures prices for a change. For the past few weeks, rising grain prices had given stock and bond traders another reason to be gloomy about inflation and had helped depress stock and bond prices. But traders seemed to conclude yesterday that the weather fears driving grain prices wouldn't necessarily prompt higher interest rates -- the big fear in the stock and bond markets.    ---   Bruce Ingersoll in Washington contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
