Mogual, Silicon GraphicsandM;&quot;Some data is easier to understand if you can see it.&quot;andP;  (He managed to talkon that theme for 5 whole minutes without even mentioning an old Chineseproverb!)andM;His company offers graphics processors that range in price from workstationclass ($15K) to &quot;super&quot; class ($120K).andP;  Last week they introduced theirnewest version of a supergraphics computer.andP;  It is comprised of up to 8&quot;tightly coupled CPUs.andP;  ...  for imagery and geometric processin.&quot;andP;  Itcontains &quot;85 custom chips and 4.7 million gates.&quot;andM;He showed an impressive demo video tape.andM;Software: Mike Wilson, Wavefront TechnologiesandM;&quot;We focus on presentation and advanced 3D graphics.&quot;andM;Why use visualization?andM;1.andP;  To convey complex concepts.andM;2.andP;  To validate designs.andM;- Example: prototyping a new automobile.andM;Visualization is faster, cheaper, and in some ways better than a physicalmodel.andM;3.andP;  To &quot;create a virtual viewing environment.&quot;andM;- To go where no camera has gone before.andM;Examples: the interior of an atom of the exterior of the universe.andM;In visualization, the projected image needs:andM;* position and shapeandM;* colorandM;* transparency (when applicable)andM;* timeandM;* textureandM;* vector (direction and magnitude)andM;* tensor -- &quot;multi-directional glyphs&quot; (What's a glyph?)andM;The software process to create images follow these steps:andM;1.andP;  object preparation -- data translationandM;2.andP;  modelingandM;3.andP;  motion creationandM;4.andP;  material selectionandM;5.andP;  image creationandM;He showed an impressive demo of some of their work.andP;  One segment was theformation of a major storm.andP;  The sequence was then return showing the sotrm'seffects on air currents within the storm.andP;  Being able to see what happens isentirely different from reading the reams of printout that would be needed todescribe it mathematically.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
