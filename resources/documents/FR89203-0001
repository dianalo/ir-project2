Theterm ``presidential review'' is used in the recommendation to refer toa program of systematic oversight and dialogue that involves coordinatingagency actions where conflicts exist, and probing the agency's fact andpolicy judgments with the purpose of ensuring that the agency considersfactors of importance to the President's policies to the extent permittedby law. However the term ``presidential review'' does not include displacementof responsibilities placed in the agency by law or the use of factors nototherwise permitted by law. In addition, the Conference does not addressreview of agency rulemaking of an ad hoc nature pursuant to the President'sconstitutional authority.Recommendation 88-10, Federal Use of Computers in Acquiring and ReleasingInformation, is intended to guide agencies in addressing the questionsthat will arise when an agency considers whether to acquire or releaseinformation in electronic form. The recommendation suggests an analyticalframework for assessing options when electronic acquisition or releaseof information may facilitate performance of the agency's mission or maybe helpful in fulfilling agency obligations under the Freedom of InformationAct. Relevant factors identified in the recommendation include costs andbenefits as well as the appropriate roles of the public and private sectors.The Conference also urges agencies to experiment with electronic meansof providing public participation in administrative proceedings.Recommendation 88-11, Encouraging Settlements by Protecting Mediator Confidentiality,suggests several steps intended to ensure appropriate confidentiality toinformation divulged to mediators and other neutrals in the course of settlementnegotiations involving a statute, rule or policy administered by a federalagency. The recommendation covers agency use of contracts, policy statementsand procedural rules to ensure confidentiality of information in appropriatesituations, and it contains a model rule that agencies may adopt to governconfidentiality of communications with mediators.Recommendations of the Administrative Conference are published in fulltext in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>upon adoption.

Among its wide variety of national goals are: Ensuring competitivemarkets, spurring economic growth, checking inflation, reducing unemployment,protecting national security, assuring equal opportunity, increasing socialsecurity, protecting the environment, ensuring safety, and improving energysufficiency. Policies implementing these goals compete for scarce resourcesand sometimes conflict with one another. Thus, a central task of moderndemocratic government is to make wise choices among the courses of actionthat pursue one or more of these goals.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">While Congress establishes the goals, it seldom legislates the detailsof every action taken in pursuit of these goals or makes the balancingchoices that these decisions require. It has assigned this task to theregulatory agencies. Each regulatory agency, however, usually is givena set of primary goals, without specific regard for whether proposed actionsin pursuit of those goals might conflict with the pursuit of other goalsby other agencies. An effective mechanism is needed to coordinate agencydecisions with the judgments of officials having a broader perspective,such as the President and Congress.\1\<NOTE/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The need for greater coordination of federal regulationwas recognized in 1979 by the American Bar Association's Commission onLaw and the Economy.<ITAG tagnum="21">Some form of presidential review of agency rulemaking has been thepractice since at least 1971. Like its predecessors, the current programis established by presidential executive order.\2\<NOTE/> The responsible officer (the Administrator, Office of Informationand Regulatory Affairs, in the Office of Management and Budget) is appointedby the President, subject to Senate confirmation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Exec. Orders Nos. 11,821, 11,949 (President Ford), Exec.Order 12,044 (President Carter), Exec. Orders Nos. 12,291, 12,498 (PresidentReagan). For a thorough analysis of the experince under the executive orders,<T3>see </T3>National Academy of Public Administration, Presidential Managementof Rulemaking in Regulatory Agencies (Jan. 1987).<ITAG tagnum="21">The Conference believes that there is sufficient experience underthese executive orders to warrant continuing such review with certain guidelinesas to its implementation. The Recommendation below sets forth standardsthat should be followed whether review is governed by executive order orby a general statute. It also assumes that the President has the authorityto enunciate principles to guide agency rulemaking, even though the programmaticresponsibilities are by statute delegated to agencies. In addressing thepresidential review process, the Conference recognizes that some of theissues are analogous to congressional involvement in agency rulemaking,but it does not address this latter subject at this time.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Recommendation</ITAG>The Conference recommends that the following principles should guide anyprogram of presidential review \3\<NOTE/> of agency rulemaking.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Presidential review, as used in this Recommendation, refersto a program of systematic executive oversight and dialogue that involvescoordinating agency actions where conflicts exist, and in all cases probingthe agency's fact and policy judgments, with the purpose of ensuring thatthe agency considers factors of importance to the President's policiesto the extent permitted by law. Such review does not displace responsibilitiesplaced in the agency by law nor authorize the use of factors not otherwisepermitted by law. Other review of an ad hoc nature by the President (orthe President's delegates) of agency rulemaking pursuant to the President'sconstitutional authority is not within the scope of this Recommendation.1.General ApplicabilityPresidential review should apply generally to federal rulemaking. Suchreview can improve the coordination of agency actions and resolve conflictsamong agency rules and assist in the implementation of national priorities.However, not all agency rules or categories of rules may be appropriatefor such presidential review. Exempt categories include formal rulemaking,ratemaking, and rulemaking that resolves conflicting private claims toa valuable privilege.2. Applicability to Independent Regulatory AgenciesAs a matter of principle, presidential review of rulemaking should applyto independent regulatory agencies to the same extent it applies to therulemaking of Executive Branch departments and other agencies.3. Timeliness of Review The process of presidential review of rulemaking, including agency participation,should be completed in a timely fashion by the reviewing office and, whenso required, by the agencies, with due regard to applicable administrative,executive, judicial and statutory deadlines.4. Public Disclosure of Documents(a) <T3>Proposed or Final Rules. </T3>Where an agency submits a draft proposedor final rule for presidential review, the agency submission and any additionalformal analyses \4\<NOTE/> submitted for presidential review should be made availableto the public when the proposed or final rule to which they pertain ispublished. If a decision is made to terminate a rulemaking after a noticeof proposed rulemaking has been published, agency submissions to the officeresponsible for presidential review and any additional formal analysessubmitted for review should be made available to the public when the decisionto terminate is announced.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ See ACUS Recommendation 85-2, Agency Procedures for PerformingRegulatory Analysis of Rules, 1 CFR 305.85-2.(b) <T3>Review of Agendas or Other Summaries or Schedules of Agency RulemakingActions. </T3>Where an agency submits agendas or other summaries or schedulesof pending or planned rulemakings for presidential review, the agency submissionand any supporting documents submitted for presidential review should bemade available to the public once the agenda or other summary or scheduleis made known to the public in an official publication.5. Executive Branch Communications Relating to Presidential Review of Rulemaking(a) <T3>Policy Guidance. </T3>An agency engaged in informal rulemaking shouldbe free to receive guidance concerning that rulemaking at any time fromthe President, members of the Executive Office of the President, and othermembers of the Executive Branch, without having a duty to place these communicationsin the public file of the rulemaking unless otherwise required by law.However, official written policy guidance from the officer responsiblefor presidential review of rulemaking should be included in the publicfile of the rulemaking once a notice of proposed rulemaking or final ruleto which it pertains is issued or when the rulemaking is terminated withoutissuance of a final rule.\5\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ The Conference's position on the public availability ofofficial written policy guidance stated in this Recommendation modifiesits earlier position in Recommendation 80-6, Intragovernmental Communicationsin Informal Rulemaking Proceedings, 1 CFR 305.80-6, andpara;1.(b) <T3>Factual Information. </T3>When an agency engaged in rulemaking receivesa communication from the office responsible for presidential review whichcontains factual information relating to the substance of the rulemakingthat is not already in the public file, the agency should promptly placethe communication (or if oral, a summary) in the public file of the rulemaking.\6\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ Agencies also should place factual information receivedfrom other sources in the public file of the rulemaking, <T3>see </T3>Recommendation 80-6, andpara;2.(c) <T3>Communications Transmitting Outside Comments. </T3>When an agency receivesa communication from the office responsible for presidential review whichtransmits any factual submissions or the views or positions of personsoutside the government, the agency should promptly place the communication(or if oral, a summary) in the public file of the rulemaking.\7\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ This reaffirms the Conference's position on the handlingof comments by persons outside the government stated in Recommendation80-6, andpara;2.6. Responsibility of the Reviewing Office Regarding OutsideCommentsThe officer responsible for presidential review of rulemaking should notallow the process of review to serve as a conduit to the rulemaking agencyfor unrecorded communications from persons outside the government. To guardagainst such occurrence, the responsible officer should take appropriatesteps_and the following should be considered:(a) Identifying any communications to the rulemaking agency that transmitthe views or positions of persons outside the government;(b) Promptly transmitting written communications received by the officeresponsible for presidential review from persons outside the governmentrelating to the substance of a proposed agency rule to the rulemaking agencyfor inclusion in the public file of the rulemaking;(c) Maintaining a list identifying the time and general topic of oral communicationsthat pertain to the substance of an agency rule under review with personsoutside the government and making such list available to the rulemakingagency for inclusion in the public file; and(d) Inviting a representative of the rulemaking agency to attend any meetingsbetween the reviewing office and persons outside the government which pertainto any agency rulemaking under review by that office. The agency representativeattending any such meeting should prepare an appropriate summary of thediscussion and promptly place it in the public file of the rulemaking.7. Not Judicially ReviewableThe presidential review process should be designed to improve the internalmanagement of the federal government and should not create any substantiveor procedural rights enforceable by judicial review.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 305.88-10 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Federal agency use of computers in acquiring and releasing information(Recommendation 88-10).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The rapid evolution of computer technology raises many economic andpolicy issues that affect the acquisition and release of information bygovernment agencies. New information technologies can improve public accessto public information and reduce paperwork burdens. They can also imposesignificant economic burdens, however, and they may stimulate competitionbetween government agencies and established electronic information enterprises.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The essential role of information in a democratic system underscoresthe need to examine with care the opportunities that electronic informationstorage and transmission provide for improving the flow of informationbetween government agencies and the public.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The following recommendations are intended to guide agencies in addressingthe questions that will arise when an agency considers whether to acquireor release information in electronic form, either to facilitate performanceof the agency's mission or to fulfill requirements established by the Freedomof Information Act (FOIA) or other laws.\1\<NOTE/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ OMB Circular A-130 (50 FR 52730, Dec. 24, 1985) providesa general framework for management of federal information resources. Therelationship between parts of this recommendation and provisions of theOMB Circular is as follows. Recommendation A reflects the same policy asParagraph 7(g) of the Circular, but provides additional detail. RecommendationB deals with electronic acquisition, a subject addressed in proposed OMBguidelines, but not in detail in the existing version of Circular A-130.Recommendation C suggests a cost-benefit approach to defining agency electronicdissemination activities essentially consistent with that prescribed bythe Circular, but offers a finer level of analytical detail to guide agencyselection among three different levels of release. Recommendation D suggestsdefining the boundary between public and private sectors based on a cost-benefitanalysis; this is endorsed by Paragraph 7(e) of Circular A-130, but RecommendationD defers less to private sector activities than the Circular. RecommendationE lists more specific cost and benefit categories to be considered thandoes the Circular. Recommendation F reflects the same policy as that setforth in Appendix IV to Circular A-130 (discussing paragraph 11(a)). RecommendationsG and H have no counterparts in the Circular. Recommendation I discussesthe role and limits of governmentwide policy; Circular A-130 is an exampleof such a policy. Recommendation J is consistent with Paragraph 9(c) ofthe Circular.<ITAG tagnum="21">At the present stage in the evolution of government electronic informationpolicy, the most one can do is to suggest an analytical framework withinwhich agency electronic system designers, policy makers, and budget plannerscan assess their opinions. The process and substance of decisionmakingwithin this framework should, of course, conform with general principlesof administrative law.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Because experience is now relatively limited and information technologyis subject to rapid evolution, when Congress sets policy it should do soon as broad a basis as possible. Because changes in electronic informationcapability occur at a different pace in different sectors of the society,transitional arrangements will be necessary to ensure that electronic acquisitionand release do not disadvantage major segments of the population.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The pertinent considerations depend on the context in which electronicacquisition or release of information is addressed. For example, the factorsrelevant to the release of information in electronic form in response todiscrete FOIA requests differ from those that bear on discretionary agencydecisions to release information broadly through electronic publishing.As a further example, resolution of issues pertaining to the acquisitionof information in electronic form might depend on such factors as the technologicalcapacity of the private parties from whom electronic filing is to be requested.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Recommendation A addresses the Freedom of Information Act. The FOIAwas written with paper records in mind. The problem is to apply the Actto information maintained in electronic form. This recommendation doesnot seek to provide comprehensive guidance but does address in generalterms such matters as whether electronic records should be deemed recordssubject to the FOIA and whether an agency should be expected to write newcomputer programs for the purpose of responding to a FOIA request.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Recommendations B and C discuss principles applicable to electronicacquisition and release of information, respectively. Recommendation Doffers principles for defining the appropriate roles of the public andprivate sectors in the provision of electronic acquisition and releasesystems.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Recommendations C and D envision a three-step process for evaluatingpossible new electronic information products. The first step in the evaluationprocess is to identify the current level of release of the informationthat would be contained in a new electronic information product. Thereare in general terms three possible levels of agency activity in releasinginformation: (i) ``dissemination'' or ``publishing'', leading to the broadestavailability of information; (ii) ``disclosure'', involving wholesalingto private information suppliers or providing electronic release capabilityin public reference rooms; and (iii) ``access'', involving ad hoc releasein response to discrete requests. For the special meaning of these andother related terms used in this recommendation, it is important to referto the appended glossary.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The second step is to identify the benefits and costs of replacingor supplementing existing means of release with various levels of electronicrelease. An agency should not offer an electronic information product unlessthe cost-benefit analysis demonstrates that the electronic alternativeanalyzed is likely to be superior to existing means. The third step isto define the most desirable public and private sector roles, applyingprinciples described in Recommendation D.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Deciding to ``promote'' electronic publishing does not necessarilymean a direct, retail, electronic publishing and distribution role forthe government, if private sector electronic publishing activities andcommitments are more cost effective (see Recommendation D). Electronicpublishing contemplated by this recommendation also can occur through depositorylibraries. In some cases it may be appropriate to retain both paper andelectronic versions of the same information, even though costs almost certainlywill be higher than for either form alone.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Recommendation E identifies cost and benefit categories that shouldbe considered in applying Recommendations B, C and D. Recommendations Fthrough J deal with discrete questions of policy and technology: For example,the use of private telecommunications systems, the undesirability of exclusiveprivate or public control of information, and the need to stay abreastof developing technologies.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">These recommendations do not address such important issues as protectionof trade secrets or privileged commercial information, invasion of personalprivacy, or the need for Congress and agencies to consider allocating budgetaryresources so that FOIA staffs will include persons skilled in using electronicdatabases. Nor do they address in detail the security of electronic databases.These subjects deserve separate investigation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The recommendations also do not address issues pertaining to automationof internal agency functions including important questions of records retention,evidentiary use of electronic records, and program administration. Ratherthe recommendations assume that an agency has automated or will automatean identifiable portion of its activities and therefore is confronted withthe questions of whether and how to establish interfaces between internalelectronic information systems and the outside world.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Recommendation</ITAG>A. Freedom of Information Act1. In interpreting the Freedom of Information Act, agencies should recognizethat a ``record'' includes information maintained in electronic form.2. Agencies using electronic databases rather than paper records shouldnot deny access to the electronic data on the grounds that the electronicdata are not ``records,'' that retrieval of the electronic informationis equivalent to creation of a ``new'' record, or that programming is requiredfor retrieval. In responding to FOIA requests, agencies should provideelectronic information in the form in which it is maintained or, if sorequested, in such other form as can be generated directly and with reasonableeffort from existing databases with existing software. Agencies, however,should not be obligated under the FOIA to create large new databases forprivate advantage, thus using agency resources for private purposes. Agenciesshould use a standard of reasonableness in determining the nature and extentof the programming that provides an appropriate search for and retrievalof records in responding to FOIA requests, and in determining the extentto which FOIA requesters may ask the agency to produce data organized informats other than those used by the agency in the regular course of itsoperation.\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Agencies should be able to recover the costs of complyingwith FOIA requests, including programming costs, in a manner consistentwith the Freedom of Information Reform Act of 1986, 100 Stat. 3207, 3207-48(1986), amending 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(A), and related OMB guidance, 52 FR10012, 10017 (1987).3. Differences in technologies and database structures used by individualagencies make it necessary, for the near term, to define FOIA obligationson a case-by-case basis. Further experience with electronic informationsystems is a prerequisite to the formulation of general rules applicableto such controversies under the Act as how requesters must identify therecords sought, how much programming, if any, an agency must do, and howcosts shall be borne. The concept of reasonableness applied to searchesfor paper information made in response to FOIA requests should providea useful guideline for resolving controversies over the application ofFOIA to electronically maintained data.B. Acquisition of Information in Electronic Form1. Agencies should acquire information in electronic form when they use,or will use, the information in that form and when most information submittersalready maintain information electronically, or have ready access to intermediarieswho will prepare and submit it in electronic form. When agencies sponsorelectronic acquisition programs, they should make clear their intentionthat all information required will eventually be available to them in electronicform, either by strictly administering exceptions to mandatory programs,or by undertaking the conversion of paper submissions into electronic formthemselves.2. When most providers of information (``filers'') are technologicallysophisticated, it is appropriate for agencies to require electronic filingof information, after developing standard formats in consultation withthe filer community, and after appropriate testing and transition periods.3. In determining whether to require or permit electronic filing of informationand in designing the particulars of an electronic acquisition program,agencies should carefully weigh the costs and benefits of electronic acquisitionof information. The analysis should address the factors identified in RecommendationD together with other considerations made relevant by the agency's mandate.4. Agencies initiating electronic acquisition programs should take stepsto facilitate electronic filing by entities having limited technologicalcapacity (without raising the costs for sophisticated entities), includingthe optional use of ``smart forms.'' When a significant proportion of thefiler community is technologically unsophisticated, electronic acquisitionmay be feasible only through intermediaries. In such cases, agencies shouldcreate economic incentives for electronic filing rather than mandatingit. Part of the economic incentive to file electronically under voluntaryelectronic acquisition programs can be the imposition of a fee on technologicallysophisticated filers who choose to file on paper, assuming the statutoryauthority to do so exists.C. Release of Information in Electronic Form1. Electronic information release policies should depend on such factorsas (a) whether the desired level of release consists of electronic publishing,electronic disclosure, or electronic access in response to FOIA requests(see the glossary for definitions of these terms); (b) the agency's policiesin releasing like information maintained in paper records; and (c) thecosts and benefits of replacing or supplementing an existing paper mediumwith an electronic medium.2. When a statute or agency policy mandates the publishing of information,the agency should itself electronically publish the information or facilitateits electronic publication by others, unless the cost-benefit analysissuggests the desirability of restricting publishing to the paper medium,possibly accompanied by a lower level of electronic release.\3\<NOTE/> If the agency publishes the information only on paper, itshould consider electronic publication of the availability of the paperinformation products. Where an agency publishes information electronically,it should consider the feasibility of providing dial-up access.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ When a statute mandates electronic publishing, the agencywould not have discretion to restrict publication to a paper medium orto a lower level of electronic release.3. When a statute mandates public reference room disclosure, or paper productspresently are made available through a public reference room, agenciesshould provide electronic disclosure in public reference rooms of informationalready in electronic form. Such agencies should consider the costs andbenefits of upgrading from electronic disclosure to electronic publishing.Agencies should also make information disclosed electronically availableto any requester in an electronic form that would be easily usable by informationresellers.4. In those instances where an agency maintaining information in electronicform has no mandate to release information other than in response to FOIArequests, the agency should consider upgrading release of appropriate partsof this information to electronic disclosure through public reference roomsand wholesaling in electronic bulk form to private sector requesters.\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ The prices for such electronic information would be determinedunder the general user fee statute, 31 U.S.C. 9701, or under the FOIA.See OMB's user fee guidelines, restated in App. IV to OMB Circular A-130,50 FR 52748 (1985).D. Allocation of Responsibilities Between Public andPrivate Sectors1. Agencies that have decided under Recommendations B and C to acquireor release information in electronic form should define the appropriateroles of the public and private sectors in providing that information andrelated products (including telecommunications facilities, indexes andretrieval software as well as raw data). That choice should depend on therelative costs and benefits of privately versus publicly provided informationproducts.2. When choosing between publishing and a lower level of electronic releaseof information, an agency should determine whether private sector providersare willing to supply electronic products having features (e.g., user-friendlymenus) that will give the public greater benefits or lower costs than wouldelectronic publishing by the agency. When an agency relies on the privatesector for electronic publishing of agency information, the agency shouldseek to establish by contract the nature of the products to be provided.3. When an agency determines that its mission warrants new electronic meansof acquisition or release of information and the private sector will notcommit to provide them at appropriate prices, the agency should providethem, if clearly identified non-economic and economic benefits outweighthe capital and marginal costs. Agencies should recognize, however, thatthere may be circumstances where the costs to an agency would suggest thewisdom of creating incentives for the private provision of the desiredelectronic information product_for example, the free use of agency-developedsoftware.E. Determination of Costs and Benefits1. Agencies should take into account the following costs in the decisionmakingprocesses suggested in Recommendations B, C and D:(a) Capital costs to the agency of establishing the product, and the probableeconomic life and other uses over which the costs should be allocated;(b) Capital costs to information consumers and information providers toutilize the product, and the probable economic life and other uses overwhich these costs should be allocated;(c) The marginal costs to the agency of user access;(d) Marginal costs to users for obtaining the information;(e) Marginal costs to electronic information providers of updating theelectronic information;(f) Unrecovered costs associated with existing government or private sectorcapital that would be made obsolete by the new product;(g) The costs of updates and upgrades in service levels or capacity necessaryto permit intended benefits to be realized at levels of demand expectedover the long term; and(h) Costs of changing to standard formats or of handling different formats.2. Agencies should take into account the following benefits in decisionmakingprocesses suggested in Recommendations B, C and D: (a) Savings associated with eliminating the cost of producing and maintainingexisting paper products;(b) Savings to agencies and consumers associated with upgrading the levelof information release from ad hoc FOIA disclosure to electronic disclosurein a public reference room;(c) Savings to agencies and consumers associated with upgrading paper publicreference room disclosure to electronic publishing;(d) Increase in the number of interested persons having access to information;(e) Improvements in the utility of information for its intended purposebecause of improved organization and retrieval capabilities; and (f) Reductions in delays associated with transferring information froman agency to eventual consumers. 3. Cost-benefit analyses should take into account FOIA obligations, includingobligations to protect trade secrets and other exempt information. In designingelectronic databases, agencies should consider the types of FOIA requestslikely to be received for data in the database, consulting with representativeusers when feasible. Insofar as it is consistent with agency mission performance,databases should be designed so as to facilitate reponses to FOIA requests.A proper rule of thumb is that it should not be any more difficult to obtaininformation under the FOIA after automation than before.4. In some cases, effective design may require some sacrifices in electronicFOIA retrieval capability. In these cases, agency designers of electronicdatabases and retrieval software should consider how FOIA requests canbe satisfied consistent with the spirit of the Act. For example, an agencymight choose to make raw data available to requesters in computer-readableform along with retrieval software, so that requesters can effect theirown retrievals. In other situations, new electronic information productsmay reduce costs of FOIA requests, to both requesters and agencies. Thiswould occur, for example, if information were published or otherwise madeaccessible electronically in a public reference room, rather than providedonly on paper in response to FOIA requests. F. Exclusive Control of Public InformationAn agency generally should not grant a private party exclusive controlof its electronic information or of the acquisition or release thereof.Nor should the agency itself as a general matter maintain such controlin the absence of a compelling public purpose. Where an agency has, andwishes to exercise, authority to enter into an exclusive arrangement providinga private sector vendor with a preferential right to electronic information,the agency should first consider whether the analysis suggested in RecommendationsB, C, D and E demonstrates that efficiencies can be achieved through suchan arrangement. The agency should also guard against the possibility thatthe arrangement may be inconsistent with its responsibilities under theFOIA or may impair the ability of the agency and the public to benefitfrom subsequent technological developments.G. Technology Issues1. Agencies should use proven technologies in their electronic acquisitionand release systems. They should stay abreast of the state-of-the-art inall matters related to the electronic acquisition and release of informationand should be particularly alert to the need for up-to-date and effectiveaccess control and other techniques required to maintain an appropriatelevel of security.2. Agencies should seek to base electronic information formats on existingstandards efforts such as American National Standards Institute standardson Electronic Business Data Interchange \5\<NOTE/> before developing their own distinctive format definitions.\6\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ These standards are currently designated as ``X.12''.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ Cf. Recommendation 78-4, Federal Agency Interaction withPrivate Standard-setting Organizations in Health and Safety Regulation,1 CFR 305.78-4.3. Whenever possible, agencies should use public data networks rather thandeveloping their own communications links for public filers or consumers.4. Agencies should consider conducting demonstration projects to experimentwith evolving electronic information technology. H. Electronic Participation in Administrative ProceedingsAgencies should experiment with electronic means of providing public participationin rulemaking, adjudication and other administrative proceedings, whileretaining a means of effective participation for persons who lack the meansto access the electronic information system.I. Government-wide Policy on Electronic Information1. A government-wide policy on electronic information is desirable to affordguidance to agencies. Such a policy should articulate goals consistentwith those expressed in the foregoing recommendations. 2.

The Conference,of course, recognizes the principle that decisions affecting the publicwelfare ought to be made in the open and subject to public and judicialscrutiny. Nevertheless, since settlements are essential to administrativeagencies, a careful balance must be struck between the openness requiredfor the legitimacy of many agency agreements and the confidentiality thatis critical if sensitive negotiations are to yield agreements. This recommendationattempts to strike that balance, without thwarting open decisionmaking.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Most ADR techniques, including mediation, non-binding arbitration,factfinding and minitrials,\3\<NOTE/> involve a neutral third party who aids the parties in reachingagreement that resolves the issues in controversy. A skillful mediatorcan speed negotiations and increase chances for agreement by holding separateconfidential meetings with the parties, where each party may give the mediatora relatively full and candid account of its own interests (rather thanits litigating position), discuss what it would be willing to accept, andconsider alternative approaches. The mediator, armed with this informationbut avoiding premature disclosure of its details, can then help to shapethe negotiations in such a way that they will proceed most directly totheir goal. The mediator may also carry messages between the parties, launch``trial balloons,'' and act as an agent of reality to reduce the likelihoodof miscalculation. This structure can make it safe for the parties to talkcandidly and to raise sensitive issues and creative ideas. In non-bindingarbitration, minitrials and factfinding, the neutral may play a differentrole from that of a mediator, because he may issue a tentative decisionthat is then used as a basis for negotiations, but all of these neutralshave the common characteristic of helping the parties negotiate an agreement.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ For brief definitions of these terms, <T3>see </T3>the Appendix to Conference Recommendation 86-3, <T3>supra. </T3><ITAG tagnum="21">With all of these neutrals, many of the benefits of ADR can be achievedonly if the proceedings are held confidential. Confidentiality assuresthe parties that what is said in the discussions will be limited to thenegotiations alone so they can be free to be forthcoming. This need extendsto the neutral's materials, such as notes and reports, which are producedsolely to assist the neutral in the negotiation process and which otherscould misconstrue as indicating a bias against some party or interest.This is why many mediators routinely destroy their personal notes and draftsand return all other materials to the parties. Moreover, if the neutralwere to testify in a subsequent proceeding as to what went on during thenegotiations, his neutrality might be destroyed. The ADR process couldbe jeopardized because one party or another is likely to feel disadvantaged.Also, the parties ould justifiably feel their confidences might be threatened.All this would certainly inhibit future participation by parties and neutrals.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Limited protection for settlement negotiations and work product developedin preparation for litigation is provided by Rule 408 of the Federal Rulesof Evidence and Rule 26(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.However, uncertainties as to their application_not to mention the effectson confidentiality of the Freedom of Information Act_may raise obstaclesto protecting communications with ADR neutrals in federal agencies' disputes.As a result, many statutes, rules, and guidelines have explicitly providedfor some degree of confidentiality of mediation and similar materials.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Administrative Conference takes the view that maintaining confidentialityof settlement discussions is consistent with the principles underlyingthe FOIA, Rule 408 of the FRE, Rule 26(b)(3) of the FRCP, and the workproduct doctrine.

It does so in recognitionthat the mediator will virtually <T3>never </T3>have information or evidence that is not shared by at leastone other person, excepting of course the neutral's own notes, recollections,and judgments. The rule does not address (1) when meetings or negotiationsshould be held in public session, (2) what justification should be preparedto support any agreement reached, or (3) what information should be availablefrom a party to the negotiations. The rule covers oral communications oractions that are related to a settlement proceeding, as well as documentsthat are created specifically for the negotiations or other, previouslyexisting documents that are furnished to the neutral in confidence by aparticipant in the negotiation. The restrictions on the neutral's disclosinginformation from the negotiation are not categorically absolute, beingsubject to several narrow exceptions that deal with extraordinary cases.Finally, the model rule does not attempt to impose its terms on all partiesfor all issues; they would be free to vary the terms for their particularnegotiations. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Recommendation </ITAG>1.

Voluntary settlement processeswithin [the agency's] statutory mandates and existing policies can producedecisions more efficiently than traditional procedures, and often yielddecisions that are more effective than those reached without the concurrenceof persons with firsthand involvement. Settlement agreements thereby enablethe agency and the parties to accomplish their goals with expenditure offewer resources.(b) In addition to unassisted negotiations among the affected interests,alternative means of dispute resolution (``ADR'') can aid the parties inreaching agreement in appropriate cases. These techniques include facilitation,mediation, minitrials, factfinding, and non-binding arbitration. In each,a neutral third party helps the parties reach a voluntary agreement. [Theagency] encourages the use of these ADR processes as part of its policyfavoring settlements.(c) The voluntary settlement of issues in controversy through a disputeresolution process requires integrity, objectivity, and fairness on thepart of the neutral and of the process itself. Moreover, the parties mustfeel free to discuss the dispute with the neutral without fear of beingdisadvantaged by the negotiations. [The agency] takes the position thatthe public policy favoring voluntary resolution of disputes therefore requiresthat the neutral not reveal, either voluntarily or through legal compulsion,information learned in confidence during the negotiations. To encouragethe parties to negotiate, this rule enunciates an agency policy seekingto protect the confidentiality of settlement negotiations involving theneutral.andSection; xxx.2 Definitions.As used in this rule:(a) ``Issue in controversy'' means a question that is material to a decisioninvolving a statute, regulation, or policy administered by [the agency]about which persons who would be substantially affected or the agency disagree.(b) ``Settlement proceeding'' means any process, such as facilitation,mediation, minitrial, factfinding, or non-binding arbitration, that isused to resolve issues in controversy by agreement of the parties in whicha neutral serves, whether or not administrative or judicial proceedingshave been instituted.(c) ``Neutral'' means an individual who with respect to the issues in controversy_(1) Is not a party;(2) Does not have any official, financial, or personal conflict of interestunless such interest has been fully disclosed in writing and all partiesagree that the individual may nevertheless serve as a neutral; and(3) Works to aid the parties in arriving at settlement of the issues incontroversy through agreement.(d) ``Settlement communication'' means any oral or written communicationor conduct made in confidence and in connection with a settlement proceedingby any party, neutral, non-party participant, or other source of informationrelevant to the proceeding.(e) ``Settlement document'' means any written material that is_(1) Prepared for the purpose of, in the course of, or pursuant to a settlementproceeding, including memoranda, notes, and work product of the neutraland the parties, or(2) Provided to the neutral in confidence for purposes of the settlementproceeding.An agreement reached as a result of a settlement proceeding is not a settlementdocument unless the parties agree in writing, and the law allows, thatit shall be regarded as such.(f) ``In confidence'' means with the expressed desire of the source thatthe information be kept confidential or provided under circumstances thatwould create the reasonable expectation that it will not be disclosed.(g) ``Party'' means a person or entity whose dispute is the subject ofthe settlement proceeding, including representatives of such a party.(h) ``Non-party participant'' means a person or entity who is not a partyto the dispute but who participates in the settlement proceeding, suchas by providing information, analysis, advice, or views.andSection; xxx.3 Applicability of the Rule.(a) This rule applies to any settlement proceeding whether or not [theagency] is a party if the parties communicate with the neutral under circumstancesthat reasonably imply that the parties expect that the communications willbe held confidential. Prior to beginning substantive negotiations, theparties may (1) agree that this rule does not apply to their negotiationsor (2) modify the terms of this rule by agreement in which case that agreementwill prevail to the extent it is authorized by law or is otherwise consistentwith this rule. So that the neutral can decide whether he wishes to serveunder those conditions, the parties shall so inform the neutral otherwiseprior to commencing settlement proceedings. If they fail to do so, thisrule shall apply.(b) The provisions of the rule take effect when_(1) A person has been specifically requested or accepted by at least oneparty to (i) serve as the neutral in the settlement proceeding, or (ii)discuss the potential of conducting a settlement proceeding, or (iii) contactother potential parties to determine whether it would be appropriate toconvene a settlement proceeding to resolve the issues in controversy;(2) The other parties with whom the neutral has contact knows that he orshe is occupying the role of a neutral; and (3) They communicate with the neutral in that capacity.(c) The rule does not address_(1) The extent to which a party may disclose settlement documents and communicationseither voluntarily or in response to discovery or legal process; or,(2) The information that is required to support a decision or agreementreached in a settlement proceeding.andSection; xxx.4 Neutral Impartiality and Confidentiality of SettlementNegotiations.(a) A neutral shall not voluntarily or through compulsory process discloseor testify concerning settlement communications or settlement documents,unless_(1) All parties to the settlement proceeding and the neutral consent inwriting, and if the settlement communication or document was provided bya non-party participant, that participant also consents in writing;(2) The request is for a settlement document that was provided to the neutralin a public meeting or is otherwise already in the public domain;(3) The settlement document is required by law to be made public, but onlyif it is not available from the person who prepared it or from any othersource;(4) A court determines that there is a need for such testimony or disclosure.The agency takes the position that any such determination should be pursuantto a finding that the need for disclosure to_(i) prevent a manifest injustice,(ii) reveal a violation of law, or (iii) protect the public health or safetyis of sufficient magnitude in the particular case to outweigh the integrityof settlement proceedings in general by reducing the confidence of partiesin future cases that their communications will remain confidential; or(5) The settlement document or communication is relevant to the resolutionof a dispute between the neutral and a party or participant, but only tothe extent that the document or communication is used for purposes of resolvingthat dispute and not any issue in controversy in the settlement proceeding.(b) If a demand, by way of discovery request or other legal process, ismade for disclosure by the neutral of a settlement document or communication,the neutral shall make reasonable efforts to notify the parties and anyaffected non-party participant so that countermeasures may be taken ifdesired.andSection; xxx.5 Agency Records.(a) The agency makes no claim of control or ownership over the notes, memoranda,and other work product prepared by a neutral or by his or her staff inconnection with a settlement proceeding.(b) The agency takes the position that settlement documents and communicationsare not agency records solely on account of their having been receivedby the neutral during a settlement proceeding; a document or other materialthat is otherwise an agency record remains as such.<ITAG tagnum="6">Michael W.
