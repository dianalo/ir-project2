The nature of the discussions was not disclosed and prosecutorsand defense lawyers on Thursday declined to discuss their content.But the tapes could emerge as critical evidence in the Milken'sscheduled March 1990 trial on fraud and racketeering charges.   The tape recordings, made on Oct. 1, Oct. 9 and Nov. 6, 1986,were mentioned in a letter from the government to lawyersrepresenting Milken. The letter was attached to a recent filing inU.S. District Court in Manhattan.   The final recorded conversation occurred just eight days beforethe revelation that Boesky made a deal to cooperate withprosecutors in their probe of Wall Street corruption.   Milken, the former head of junk bond operations for DrexelBurnham Lambert Inc., was indicted in March on 98 counts of fraudand racketeering for an alleged series of schemes with Boesky.   Boesky in November 1986 agreed to plead guilty to one criminalcount of filing false information with the government and isserving a three-year jail term.   His stock dealings with Milken formed the basis of much ofMilken's indictment, principally a $5.3 million payment from Boeskyto Drexel to settle the balance in what the government calls asecret arrangement involving insider trading, tax fraud, riggedcorporate takeovers and other violations.   It was known that Boesky secretly tape-recorded conversationsafter he was recruited as an informant but the identities of thosehe tape-recorded had not been disclosed previously. Boesky wasfirst implicated in the spring of 1986 by investment banker DennisLevine and he agreed to cooperate with prosecutors some time thatsummer.   If the tapes contain damaging information about Milken, theycould strengthen the government's case. But if Milken said nothingincriminating despite attempts by Boesky to trap him, it could helpthe defense.   Tape recordings were not mentioned in the government'sindictment of Milken and two others. The government has said abroader indictment is expected in the next month.   The April 24 letter detailing the tapes was attached to a recentfiling by the government as part of the discovery process in thecase, in which prosecutors are required to inform the defense ofdocuments and other evidence gathered.   The letter said the Oct. 9 conversation was recorded on twocassettes while the others were recorded on one tape.   Assistant U.S. Attorney John K. Carroll declined to discuss thetapes.   Milken attorney Arthur Liman said in a statement released by aspokesman for Milken: ``As we've said in the past, we will not trythis case in the press, and we look forward to a full hearing incourt.''   In an internal Securities and Exchange Commission memo, thecontents of which were published by The Washington Post earlierthis month, the government said Boesky and Milken met in July 1986to substantiate the ``consulting services'' explanation allegedlyused to conceal the true nature of the $5.3 million payment.</TEXT></DOC>
