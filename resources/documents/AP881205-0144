Nir, who had been linked to the Iran-Contra affair, said in Junethat a compact allowed such covert operations, which he said hesupervised with then-National Security Council aide Oliver L. North,The Washington Post reported in Sunday's editions.   North has been charged with a variety of offenses related to theclandestine sales of U.S. arms to Iran in 1985-86 and the subsequentdiversion of proceeds to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua. He isscheduled to go on trial in late January.   Nir told the Post last summer that the agreement authorizedstill-secret operations that he and North supervised in 1985-86, thenewspaper said.
