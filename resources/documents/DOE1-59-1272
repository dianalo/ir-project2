Two categories of image analyzer can be distinguished bythe types of information made available to the computer. One class ofdevice digitizes postional information while an operator traces featuresof a microscope image or photomicrograph. The resulting data are usedby the computer to provide morphometric descriptions of the features.A second category of image analyzer, the computer-assisted imaging device(CID), does not require operator interaction during the digitizing process.Rather, a scanning digitizer transforms the image into numbers containingone intensity (z) and two positional (chi, y) image dimensions. Theseare stored in a dedicated image memory from which the image can be accessedfor display or processing. As computing power decreases in cost, CIDsare finding increasing application to cytometry, stereology, morphometry,and autoradiographic densitometry. This chapter discusses some principlesinvolved in CID densitometry. Categories of host and image processorunits are compared as are advantages of various scanner types includingscanning microscope photometers, scanning microdensitometers, chargecoupled device cameras, and vidicon cameras. Errors associated with thescanners are treated, as are software procedures for error correction.</TEXT></DOC>
