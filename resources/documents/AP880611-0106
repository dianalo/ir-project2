COLEMAN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jesse Jackson said Saturday he will continueseeking delegates to boost his strength at the Democratic NationalConvention, where he wants a laundry list of issues included in theparty's platform.   Jackson, whose 1988 presidential prospects evaporated whenMassachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis clinched the Democraticnomination last Tuesday, announced his plan in an hour-long speechbefore about 1,200 singing, cheering, applauding supporters at theChicago headquarters of Operation PUSH, the civil rights group hefounded.   ``We're going to Atlanta with the ability to help shape theplatform,'' Jackson said. ``Jesse is working on solidifying theRainbow Coalition movement and unifying the Democratic Party.''   He said he would announce specifics of his plans within the nextweek or so.   Jackson said he would spend a significant amount of time beforethe July convention pursing the support of ``super delegates,'' the643 party leaders and politicians who received seats as delegatesbecause of their posts.   Jackson has won support from just 54 super delegates, while 347are backing Dukakis, according to The Associated Press delegatecount. The rest are uncommitted.   The issues, which Jackson wants to become part of the party'splatform, include achieving statehood for the District of Columbia;getting Congress to declare South Africa a terrorist state; andestablishing a program of national health care.   Jackson again staked his claim to the No. 2 spot on theDemocratic ticket, which he says should be offered to him becauseof his second place finish in the race for the party's presidentialnomination. On Saturday, he said his experience in foreign policywould strengthen a ticket with Dukakis.   ``Dukakis says he wants a vice president with foreign policyexperience. Well ... ,'' Jackson said, pausing to an ovation.   With relations eased between the United States and the SovietUnion, the most critical foreign policy issues and conflicts are inthe developing world, said Jackson.   ``The selection of the vice president could be used to givesomeone with Third World experience and sensitivity a chance,''Jackson said.   Jackson said he was not interested in a Cabinet post, saying``an appointment position is also a disappointment position. A vicepresidential position is a constitutional position from which youcannot be fired because you're elected by the people.''   Jackson said, however, that if he were asked to be the vicepresidential nominee, acceptance would not be automatic.   ``It's a matter that my family must wrestle with, I must wrestlewith personally. It's a decision I will make at the time.''   ``The fundamental question right now is our constituency hasearned serious consideration'' for the vice presidentialnomination, he said. ``Surely based upon the tone we've set, thevotes we've delivered, the elections we've won, the general mandatewe've gotten from the American people, has earned us seriousconsideration.''</TEXT></DOC>
