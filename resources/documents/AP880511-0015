(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A Japanese monkey on the loose for 10months in southern Indiana is feasting on bananas, peanut butterand cat food this week while authorities try to figure out how tocapture the wily fugitive.   ``He's been here twice today so far,'' said Janice Rodgers, whospotted the Japanese macaque last week and began feeding it.   ``He ate peanut butter sandwiches yesterday because I was out ofbananas,'' she said Tuesday. ``He liked them real well, except hegot real disgusted when he got peanut butter between his _ I guessyou would call them his fingers.''   The Japanese macaque, dubbed ``Jack the Macaque'' by Mrs.Rodgers, stands about 3{ feet tall, weighs about 30 pounds and hasa silky, tan coat.   Macaques are generally found in southern Asia and the EastIndies. Jack, a resourceful little primate, survived the winterapparently by foraging.   Conservation officers say he runs away as soon as someone inuniform appears. ``He's a pretty smart monkey,'' said Gary Ault,conservation officer at Paynetown. ``He's kind of allergic touniforms.''   He escaped about 10 months ago from the Reptile Kingdom in BrownCounty, about 35 miles from Mrs. Rodgers' home here near theHoosier National Forest.   Attempts to recapture the monkey have failed. On Friday, Jackturned up his nose at three tranquilized bananas in favor of a dishof cat food behind the Rodgers' house.   ``He hadn't done that before,'' said Mrs. Rodgers. ``Then hewent out and sat down by the bananas and took a couple of bites andspit them out.'' Jack was a little woozy, but made it back to thewoods.   When Mrs. Rodgers first saw the monkey last Wednesday she calledher husband, Sam, who was at work. While he phoned the sheriff'sdepartment, she offered Jack some apples, carrots and bread.   ``He just kind of looked at me like, `Oh, please.' I didn'treally know what to do,'' she said. ``I didn't want to scare himaway, so I did what I thought (ape researcher) Jane Goodall woulddo, I squatted down low so that I was about his size.''   When the police car pulled up, the monkey grabbed an apple andcarrot and ran for the woods.   The animal isn't considered especially dangerous, though Mrs.Rodgers said owner Thomas Tilton told her the monkey might attackif he felt threatened.   ``He's just as cute as he can be,'' said Mrs. Rodgers, addingthat she won't be too disappointed if future attempts to recapturethe monkey also fail.   ``I know the owner wants him back,'' she said. ``But I justcouldn't stand for them to drug him.''</TEXT><DATELINE>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Five Mississippi ninth-graders who beat200 other teams playing a stock market simulation say they used thestrategies and tactics of real investors to reap a $110,723 ``paperprofit.''   And just like real investors they had a fearful day when themarket crashed on Oct. 19. As the stock market plummeted 508points, they were left holding a handful of cheap stocks that noone wanted to buy.   ``We lost $34,000,'' said Auburn Wessman of Bailey AlternativeSchool. ``We wanted to buy some penny stocks because they go up ahigher percentage. But the crash came along, and they just wentdown, down, down.''   The 15-year-old is one of five Bailey ninth-graders who playedthe stock market in a 10-week game sponsored by McLarty andamp; Co. andThe Clarion-Ledger-Jackson Daily News.   More than 200 Mississippi teams competed with others across thenation in the game, developed by the Securities IndustriesAssociation and coordinated by the American Enterprise Center.   Each team started with an imaginary $100,000 and a $100,000 lineof credit. They bought and sold stocks according to daily closingprices, and even paid imaginary broker fees.   The Bailey group, led by government teacher Johnny Gilbert,followed stocks in USA Today and watched business reports daily.They met for two hours every week to make plans to buy and sell.   Their strategy was to short-sell an engineering stock, get ridof two others at a profit, and hold onto the earnings with stableIBM.   Gilbert wanted his six teams to learn how to take risks and howto recover from mistakes. He offered advice but didn't force theteams to follow it.   ``I just told them to ask, `What companies might make somemoney?''' Gilbert said. ``It's hard to teach the risk, but I toldthem it's like a big crap game.''</TEXT></DOC>
