The version given demands a co-processer and a VGA/EGAscreen. The distribution is worked out for five different liquid flowsin the interval of 0,1-2,0 1/min. pr. m2. The loss of pressure over thecollector during that interval is rechoned and is stated as a functionof the total volume flow in the collector. The calculation of liquidflow distribution in linked solar collectors is also worked out by calculatingfive different liquid flows, between 0,1 and 2,0 1/min. pr. m2 solarcollector, and the total loss of pressure is given as a function of thevolume flow in the collectors. The results must be considered as guidelines.The author explains the mathematical principles that the program buildson, which are based on Kirchhof's law on a hydraulic circulation, andthen continiues to explain how to use the program.
