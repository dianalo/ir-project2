It has beenfashionable lately to predict another crisis in the U.S.financial system -- banks or insurance companies -- followingthe savings-and-loan debacle. While the banking system is farless precarious than the thrifts ever were, both suffer fromthe breakdown of the American political system.   This is true in both a historical and contemporary sense.Politicians have always been suspicious of bankers. To stopthe depredations of big banks, they carved the industry intoslices some 60 years ago, ensuring there'd be a lot of littlebanks restricted to narrow purposes. But the essence of banksafety is diversification. We saw this in the thrift crisis,the original problem being borrowing short to fund long-termmortgages.</LP><TEXT>   And we are seeing it again in New England, where aregional recession has damaged or even wrecked the bankswhose business is limited by law to lending in that region.The McFadden Act of 1927, which prevents the creation of atrue national banking system in the U.S., virtually ensuresthat if a region falters, the banks tethered to that regionare also likely to falter. The collapse of energy prices inthe late 1970s and early 1980s took down banks in Texas andOklahoma.   In each crisis, the FDIC is obliged to step forward toguarantee bank deposits, which in turn draws down theagency's own funds. The FDIC then replenishes the fund viahigher premium assessments on the remaining healthy banks.Trouble is, the &quot;healthy&quot; banks are themselves trying torebuild their own assets to comply with the regulators'stricter capital requirements. And thus our current recessionspreads from industry to industry and region to region.   Now, we have a fractional reserve banking system in theU.S.; indeed, credit extension and economic growth depend onsuch a system. But it means there is no way a bank can keepmoney on hand to pay all deposits at once. Nor is there anyway to construct a deposit-insurance system that can bail outall banks (or even all thrifts) at once. The isolatedfailures from bad or even crooked management can be insured;widespread failures from macroeconomic collapse cannot be.The best way to insure the banks' health is to keep thegeneral economy healthy. Which brings us to the currentpolitical breakdown.   Washington's most recent efforts at helping the economyconsisted of passing an enormous tax increase coupled with abudget reform whose cost-estimating provisions wereoverturned by House Democrats within 48 hours of the newcongressional session. To lift the economy, we've proposedcutting the tax on capital gains, which by definition wouldraise the value of New England's depressed real-estate loans.The market would quickly capitalize any viable property'shigher after-tax returns as higher prices. In the fall of1989, the House voted a capital-gains cut and a Senatemajority seemed ready to support it. But it was personallykilled by Senate Majority Leader Mitchell, from Maine.   The Bush administration is expected to introducelegislation soon to fix many of the weaknesses in the currentsystem -- putting limits on deposit insurance, breaking downthe anti-competitive restraints of McFadden and theGlass-Steagall Act and creating a more unified regulatoryapparatus. But every account we've seen of this effortcarries a qualifier: The administration's bill must passthrough the same banking committees that have thwarted systemreform for more than 10 years.   So the regulators are left to cope as best they can. Whena Bank of New England or Penn Square collapses from anundiversified portfolio, it shakes confidence in the entirefinancial system, which is why the regulators swiftlyannounce their intention to guarantee all deposits.Guaranteeing the integrity and liquidity of the paymentssystem is properly the regulators' top priority, but in theU.S. it's a policy that diminishes market discipline, as theregulators find it impossible to create a crediblealternative to their too-big-to-fail philosophy. And thepolicy creates unfortunate anomalies: All of Bank of NewEngland's depositors are fully protected, while depositorsover $100,000 in Harlem's little Freedom National Bank wererecently given partial protection.   Absent a constructive legislative response, it may be thatthe best outcome our politics can manage is lettingregulators &quot;ad hoc&quot; their way to a new system. We note thatthe Comptroller of the Currency has just given the Texasunits of both Banc One and NCNB permission to manage theassets of failed thrifts, and that regulators now hope tosell the Bank of New England to out-of-state parties. We wishthem luck. If the FDIC's Bill Seidman can construct a morenational system by selling off the weak sisters to a Banc OneCorp., NCNB Corp. or Citicorp, so be it.</TEXT></DOC>
