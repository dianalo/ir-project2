HONG</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The United States and Japan announced today theywill jointly develop a new fighter plane in a project expected tocost more than $8 billion. Japanese Foreign Minister Sosuke Uno andU.S. Ambassador Mike Mansfield signed an agreement under which Japanwill bear the costs of planning and producing the sophisticatedplane.   The fighter, named the FSX, is to be developed by U.S. andJapanese companies.   Japanese officials have said the total cost of developing theplane and producing an initial order of 130 and an expectedfollow-up order _ both of which will go to Japan _ will be more than$8.2 billion.   Each FSX plane will cost the Japanese government $42.2 million,Japanese defense officials said.   The two allied countries had clashed on the question of U.S.participation in the project _ Japan originally sought to developthe jet using only Japanese companies and technology, while U.S.officials pressed for a joint project to trim Japan's huge tradesurplus with the United States.   The two sides reportedly agreed in June to allocate between 35and 45 percent of the project to U.S. firms.   But Defense Agency chief Kichiro Tazawa said today that ``thedetails of the division of work between the two countries will bedecided later, taking into consideration such factors as economicefficiency.''   The new fighter will be based on General Dynamics' F-16,according to the U.S. Defense Security Assistance Agency and Japan'sDefense Agency's Equipment Bureau.   The Defense Agency named Mitsubishi Heavy Industries of Japan theprime contractor and General Dynamics of the United States as asubcontractor. Two other major Japanese firms, Kawasaki HeavyIndustries and Fuji Heavy Industries, also were designated assubcontractors.   The Japanese technologies expected to be used in the planeinclude a sophisticated radar, advanced materials and a special wingto enhance maneuverability. The United States is expected to developa special engine with increased power.   The plane will cost $1.35 billion to develop in eight years, theDefense Agency said. It said mass production of the fighter plane isexpected to begin in 1997.   The new fighter will replace Japan's F-1 planes _ the onlyfighter developed by Japan since World War II _ and the F-4fighter-interceptor planes. Japan has exempted the United Statesfrom its ban on the export of military technology on condition thatusage of Japanese military technology would be limited to U.S.defense activities.   After Japan's defeat in World War II, U.S. occupation forcesclosed Japan's aviation industry until 1952, when Japanese companiesbegan servicing U.S. aircraft in the Korean War.   Since then, the domestic industry has depended heavily oncontracts from the Defense Agency, including development andproduction of F-15 fighters under license from the U.S. companyMcDonnell Douglas.   Under Japan's ``no-war'' constitution written after World War II,its Self-Defense Forces are one of the world's most heavily fundedmilitary establishments and bans the introduction of nuclear armsinto the country.   Japan is spending $27.82 billion annually for defense, orslightly more than 1 percent of its projected gross national product.   The United States maintains about 64,000 military personnel inJapan under a mutual security treaty.</TEXT></DOC>
