GANS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jesse Jackson said Saturday he will go to thefloor of the Democratic National Convention to push for including adozen of his policy proposals in the party's platform.   ``We ... are determined at this point to take all 12 of ourminority planks to the floor in Atlanta ... in order to inform,inspire and open up the process, to make our convention one ofsubstance,'' Jackson said at a news conference on the lawn of hishome.   The convention's Platform Committee last week overwhelminglyrejected the planks proposed by Jackson, including a call forboosting taxes on the wealthy, freezing defense spending, pledgingno first use of nuclear weapons and doubling the money spent oneducation.   ``We will take to the convention ... the kind of program agendathat will expand our party and make us stronger,'' Jackson said.   Asked whether he thought his decision might divide the party,Jackson said that was ``an unfair accusation ... we can have unitywithout uniformity.''   Jackson said he looked forward to discussing the convention andparty platform at his Fourth of July meeting in Boston withDukakis, when the candidates and their wives are to have dinnertogether and attend a concert.   Jackson made his remarks after meeting at his home with a groupof key advisers, including his campaign chairman, Willie Brown, theCalifornia Assembly speaker, platform committee chairwoman EleanorHolmes Norton, and Walter Fauntroy, the District of Columbia'snon-voting delegate in Congress.   Dukakis supporters contended that the Jackson proposals wouldcost the party support among moderate voters and provide campaignammunition to Vice President George Bush.   Jackson said the Pentagon defense contract procurement scandalhad encouraged him to go to the convention floor with his defensespending freeze proposal.   He said ``no one feels any more insecure'' after DefenseSecretary Frank Carlucci announced Friday his decision to freeze$1.1 billion worth of contracts thought to be tainted.   ``If we in fact cut our military budget without cutting ourdefense and more effectively use our resources for long-term healthcare, affordable housing and education, we will be a better andstronger nation,'' he said.   Jackson said there had been ``good negotiations'' so far withthe Dukakis camp, which would continue prior to the July 18 startof the convention, but he said he could not imagine a convention``where there is simply no floor debate.''</TEXT></DOC>
