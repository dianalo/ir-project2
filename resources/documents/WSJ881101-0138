He's narrowing the poll deficit, we read, with the &quot;populist&quot; campaign slogan, &quot;I'm on your side.&quot; And he's running commercials showing the Japanese flag while an announcer rails against foreign ownership. Class warfare and protectionism; where have we heard this menu before?    Last week, Mr. Dukakis was advised to revive his campaign by stressing &quot;his opposition to the takeover of America by foreign corporations and banks, his opposition to the favor-the-rich policies of the Republicans, and his strong support for tough trade policies against foreign countries which are taking the jobs of millions of Americans.&quot; The theme Mr. Dukakis is grasping in the clutch was outlined by three labor unions led by the United Auto Workers, which offered a poll saying that by a 61% to 28% margin, &quot;soft Bush and undecided voters&quot; would respond to these themes.    It's understandable, of course, that in trying to avoid a Custerlike slaughter at the polls, Mr. Dukakis would fall back on the part of his coalition that actually has the mechanical abilities to run a campaign. But in adopting the old-time AFL-CIO religion of excoriating &quot;the rich&quot; and boosting &quot;economic nationalism,&quot; he risks steering the Democratic ticket into one of history's dustbins. Today's voter doesn't want to lick the rich, but to join them. And in both parties, protectionism was the big loser in the primaries.    In striking these themes, Mr. Dukakis also stopped running away from the word &quot;liberal,&quot; declaring himself a liberal in the tradition of Roosevelt, Truman and Kennedy. On balance this is healthy, for the honorable word does need some defending. But it is also demeaning to Walter Mondale, Jimmy Carter, George McGovern and Lyndon Johnson, as well as confusing to the voters who two weeks ago saw Mr. Dukakis treat the word as an insult. But most of all, it is ironic.    Above all on the issue of protectionism. From Roosevelt's reciprocal trade agreements through the creation of GATT to the Kennedy round of trade negotiations, the liberals Mr. Dukakis cites were free traders. They surely would have supported actions like Ambassador Clayton Yeutter's decision Friday to refuse retaliation for Japan's rice quotas, though Mr. Dukakis has attacked the decision and George Bush has defensively renounced it. But Japan's rice policy is no more or less defensible than U.S. sugar policy, and retaliation would set off a spiral of trade closing. The trade-opening route is to address ubiquitous agricultural barriers in a multinational framework, as Presidents Roosevelt, Truman and Kennedy surely would have recognized.    If the old-time liberals wouldn't recognize Mr. Dukakis's trade policies (or his defense attitudes), they would be at home with class-warfare themes. Over the years they won bushels of votes running for the little guy against Herbert Hoover. But when it came time to &quot;get this country moving again,&quot; President Kennedy proposed to cut taxes. It did not bother him that reducing the top marginal rate to 70% from 90% might be depicted as a &quot;giveaway to the rich.&quot;    Some even in the Democratic Party learned from this experience. Even before Mr. Reagan became President, for example, the Joint Economic Committee issued a unanimous report endorsing a supply-side view of the economy. The committe's chairman was Senator Lloyd Bentsen. Likewise, Senator Bentsen was a leading advocate of the Steiger Amendment to reduce the capital-gains rate, a hugely successful measure.    In this campaign Senator Bentsen's running mate has been listening to other advisers, making Vice President Bush's proposal to restore lower capital-gains rates the centerpiece of his assault on &quot;the rich.&quot; He refuses to admit the possibility (on the basis of actual experience, the likelihood) that a lower capital-gains rate would actually produce more revenues. Yet misunderstanding the revenue effects of changes in the capital-gains tax is the immediate cause of Governor Dukakis's budget problems back home in Massachusetts.    It's understandable why the United Auto Workers and the like would like to turn the clock back. A market cut off from the rest of the world, the workers vs. the bosses and capitalists -- these were heady days and heady themes for labor unions. Big labor has not prospered in the days of international competition, of deregulation, of entrepreneurship. The benefits of this environment redound to the risk-taker, to teamwork and to the consumer.    It will be interesting to see if Mr. Dukakis really can prosper politically with protectionism, class warfare and the AFL-CIO. The world has been moving on, and we somehow doubt that most voters want to turn back. </TEXT></DOC>
