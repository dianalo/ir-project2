BarnesStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 01/20/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> CBSTELECOMMUNICATIONS, BROADCASTING, TELEPHONE, TELEGRAPH (TEL) </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   CBS Inc. said it could have a loss of as much as $20 million in its television network operations this year.    A CBS spokesman confirmed that CBS's president and chief executive officer, Laurence A. Tisch, told a group of the network's affiliates last week that given high programming costs and assuming a continued weak national advertising outlook and no change in CBS ratings, the network could register the operating loss.    CBS's disclosure means that two of the three major networks could have losses from operations in 1987. Only top-ranked National Broadcasting Co., a General Electric Co. unit, appears certain to make a profit for the year because of its strong prime-time schedule, which includes such programs as &quot;The Cosby Show.&quot; Until last year, all three networks were highly profitable.    While the three broadcasters don't report separately their network results, Broadcasting magazine estimates that CBS network operating profit fell 19% to $226.6 million in 1985; Capital Cities/ABC Inc. network operating profit fell 34.5% to $170.3 million in 1985, and NBC operating profit jumped 92.5% to $202.5 million. Each network takes in about $2 billion in revenue each year.    The industry publication hasn't released its 1986 estimates yet, but analysts said the ABC network had a loss of about $60 million last year while CBS network profit continued to drop and NBC network profit continued to rise.    Mr. Tisch told affiliates of the projected loss at a meeting in the Virgin Islands during a discussion of the payments networks make to stations to carry network programs. Both CBS and Capital Cities/ABC, citing possible network losses, have been seeking cuts in such payments.    The loss estimate applies only to CBS's network operations, a CBS spokesman said. CBS's other operations, particularly its records division and television stations unit, are healthy.    Mr. Tisch's projection may be conservative. The spokesman noted that results in 1987's fourth quarter could significantly affect network profits because it is the first quarter leading into the 1988 Olympics and presidential election year. Such years tend to be big advertising periods for the networks. Moreover, prices for network advertising have improved recently because of a sudden short supply of available commercial time, although it remains unclear how long the upturn will continue.    The CBS estimate takes into account special write-downs the company took in 1986's third quarter that reduced the value on CBS's books of some programming, including feature film rights and sports shows, a spokesman said. CBS didn't disclose the amount of the write-down.    Capital Cities/ABC has also made downward adjustments in programming values that probably will make its network operations profitable on a financial accounting basis this year. Before the adjustments, however, some analysts expect that ABC will have a loss of as much as $60 million again this year, assuming continued weak ABC ratings and soft national advertising.    The CBS spokesman said the company didn't present any proposals for cutting affiliate payments at its conference, but intends to make one at a special affiliate meeting March 30. The three networks pay more than $400 million a year to affiliates. </TEXT></DOC>
