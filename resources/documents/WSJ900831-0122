With C$150 million of cash on hand and little debt on itsbooks, Mr. Dyment said Ranger is well positioned to financeits ambitious development plans without any backing fromWestcoast Energy Inc., which became Ranger's largest holderby acquiring a 12.1% stake last December.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;If you look at all our projects on a stand-alone basis,we'd only need net C$200 million or so to develop them,&quot;which is well within Ranger's debt comfort range, Mr. Dymentsaid in an interview. &quot;We see {Westcoast} as equityshareholders, and not necessarily providing a backstop onfinancings,&quot; he said.   Westcoast, which is intent on expanding its oil and gasproduction business and was attracted by Ranger's growthpotential in the North Sea, is bound by a standstill accordthat limits its interest in Ranger to 15% until 1992, unlessa third party offers to acquire Ranger.   Mr. Dyment didn't offer a specific production forecast forRanger, though he said he sees &quot;substantial growth&quot; by 1993,when the company hopes to have four additional North Seaproperties in production. They include Ranger's 40%-ownedColumba oil field, whose development mainly depends onwhether Ranger and the U.K. government can resolve theirdifferences on fiscal terms.   Rik Parkhill, an analyst with Deacon Barclays de ZoeteWedd Ltd. in Toronto, said he estimates Ranger's oil outputwill rise to more than 24,000 barrels a day by 1993 from anaverage of 17,854 during the 1990 first half, and dailynatural gas production will climb to about 79 million cubicfeet by 1993 from a first-half average of 43.5 million.&quot;That's pretty close,&quot; said Mr. Dyment, &quot;assuming Columba ison stream.&quot;   Mr. Dyment said he expected production in 1991 will berelatively unchanged from 1990 levels, as output at the NorthSea's mature Ninian oil field is flat, and the first ofRanger's development properties aren't scheduled to come onstream until next year's fourth quarter. They includeRanger's 35.6%-owned Anglia natural gas field, and the40%-owned Staffa oil field.   Initial production at Anglia is expected to be 50 millioncubic feet a day, of which 17.5 mcf will accrue to Ranger,the field's operator. Production at Staffa, adjacent toRanger's biggest producer, Ninian, is expected to reach 8,000barrels daily, of which 3,200 barrels daily is Ranger'sshare.   Anglia will supply feedstock to a planned gas-firedelectrical power generating plant at South Denes, GreatYarmouth, in the U.K. Ranger will own 28.3% of the plant andoperate it when it starts production, scheduled for 1994.   Mr. Dyment said the next boost in production will occur bylate 1992, when the Markham natural gas field and possiblythe Columba field, come on stream.</TEXT></DOC>
