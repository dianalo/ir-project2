The polygamist, Addam Swapp, and co-defendants Vickie Singer andJohn Timothy Singer also want separate trials, court documentsindicated Wednesday.   Mrs. Singer and Swapp also are asking again to be released fromjail. A magistrate ruled earlier that they were unlikely tovoluntarily return for trial.   A similar request was filed late Wednesday on behalf of JonathanSwapp, Addam's brother, but it had not yet been added to the courtfile.   Earlier this month, Mrs. Singer, 44; John Timothy Singer, 21;Addam Swapp, 26, and Jonathan Swapp, 21, pleaded innocent tocharges stemming from the Jan. 16 bombing of the Mormon chapel inMarion and the subsequent 13-day standoff at their nearby farm.   The siege ended Jan. 28 with the shooting death of a correctionsofficer and wounding of Addam Swapp. State murder charges have notbeen filed yet.   Mrs. Singer is the widow of John Singer, a polygamist killed bypolice nine years ago during an arrest attempt, and the mother ofJohn Timothy Singer. Two of her daughters are wives of Addam Swapp.   Addam Swapp's lawyers are asking U.S. District Chief Judge BruceS. Jenkins to transfer the trial on the ground that Swapp ``cannotobtain a fair and impartial trial in the District of Utah.''   Defense attorney Bill Morrison said news coverage and religiousprejudice make a fair trial impossible.   ``The atmosphere is charged and volatile and rife withmisinformation,'' he said. ``The LDS (Mormon) Church represents asizable portion of the population.''   Government attorneys were not available to comment on whetherthey would contest any of the defense requests.</TEXT></DOC>
