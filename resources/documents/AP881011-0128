The front page editorial in Al-Joumhouriya was the first commentby Iraq's official media on the statement Saturday by IranianForeign Minister Ali Akhbar Velayati, who said the two sides agreedin principle to United Nations proposals to end the war.   The daily said that the peace talks to end the war remaindeadlocked because Iran has not committed itself to respecting freenavigation in the Persian Gulf and clearing the Shaat al-Arabwaterway.   It said there was no breakthrough in negotiations and accusedIran of continuing ``delaying tactics and procrastination.''   The negotiations are ``still on square one where they started onAug. 25,'' Al-Joumhouriya said of the talks, which moved fromGeneva to New York and are expected to return to Geneva at the endof the month.   The paper said that Iraq will not give up its demand for freenavigation in the gulf and the clearance of the Shatt al-Arab, theestuary of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers and Iraq's main outletto the sea.   Velayati said that Iran agreed to a U.N. proposal that it giveup its right to search ships in the Strait of Hormuz, the strategicmouth of the gulf.   He did not mention Iraq's demand to clear the Shatt al-Arab,which forms the southern boundary between the foes, before lettingthe talks progress.   ``Neither of the two principles can be substituted for theother,'' Al-Joumhouriya said. ``Both are closely linked.''   The paper said that Iraq cannot benefit from free navigation inthe gulf without being able to use the Shatt Al-Arab.   ``Iraq will not relinquish its rights in seeing these twoprinciples applied,'' the paper said.   Al-Joumhouriya said ``Iraq is ready to show the same patience itdisplayed during the war, but the Iranian rulers should realizethat they are impeding the process of peace,''it said.   In a related development, a senior U.N. official visited theIraqi port of Basra, the country's second-largest city, and thesouthern sector of the warfront.   U.N. peacekeeping troops have been posted along the border tomonitor the cease-fire in the 8-year-old war.</TEXT></DOC>
