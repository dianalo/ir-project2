In 1985, a year in which U.S. video game sales slid to $100million from more than $3 billion three years earlier, Nintendochose to test its home-computer-game machine in the New York market.   Those tests told the Japanese toy company it could score big inthe United States with its Nintendo Entertainment System that turnsa television into a game screen.   Thanks to the popularity of its games, Nintendo revived amoribund U.S. market to become undisputed champ of home computergames. Only recently have serious rivals emerged, particularly NECCorp., another Japanese company.   While Nintendo thrived, American companies, such as Atari Corp.and its predecessor that pioneered the home video game concept,were nursing wounds suffered from mismanaging the boom of the early1980s.   A reason why the initial phenomenon faded in the United Stateswas that companies failed to control creation and marketing,allowing a proliferation of dull games.   Analysts also say the fad that started in 1972 fizzled becausethe industry was hampered by the limitations in computer chipmemory of the early 1980s.   Enter Nintendo of America Inc., the American corporate offspringof 100-year-old Nintendo Co. Ltd., a Kyoto, Japan-based companythat started as a maker of playing cards.   From its initial tests, Nintendo has played its cards wisely,including close monitoring of the development and distribution ofgames.   Most of the cartridges that fit into Nintendo's plasticelectronic boxes are published and sold by outside softwarespecialists. Through licenses, Nintendo restricts its softwarecreators, such as in the number of games they can bring out in ayear. Nintendo has about 50 licensees for software and accessories,such as joysticks. It also has its own software development staffbut the bulk of the work is subcontracted.   Nintendo also closely tracks demand and yanks poor sellers.   ``We've had a philosophy of weeding the garden,'' says Peter T.Main, vice president of marketing at Nintendo of America.   There are 120 Nintendo titles available in the United Statescurrently, retailing for roughly $30 to $40 a piece.   Now, a second round in the video game battle is beginning.   NEC is challenging Nintendo's dominance with a system thatboasts greater computing power.   ``The technology that's in our machines allows the software todeliver a more realistic fantasy,'' says Ken Wirt, assistant vicepresident for home entertainment at NEC Home Electronics (U.S.A.)Inc., an American subsidiary of the Japanese computer andtelecommunications powerhouse.   NEC's TurboGrafx-16, to be available in toy and electronicsstores this autumn, contains a 16-bit graphics processor, doublethe capacity of Nintendo's. The 16-bit processor allows TurboGrafxto deliver clearer, more detailed images, faster action sequencesand a wider range of colors.   The brain of the TurboGrafx is still an 8-bit chip, the same asNintendo's, but Wirt says that chip doesn't need additional oomph.   ``We're not solving differential equations here,'' says Wirt.``Video games are mostly visual and audio. They're not calculationintensive.''   TurboGrafx, which will retail for about $200, or about twice theprice of the basic Nintendo system, has been designed toaccommodate optional equipment, such as a compact disc player andan audio-video enhancer.   Wirt says the higher pricetag on NEC's system is justifiedbecause research indicates that 8- to 16-year-olds _ the target agegroup _ will play NEC games twice as long as the 60 hours or sospent playing a Nintendo game.   Backing up the fancy hardware is NEC's considerable corporateclout. The company dwarfs Nintendo, with worldwide annual sales ofabout $22 billion vs. Nintendo's $1.5 billion in 1988. NEC has aresearch and development budget and a staff size that far exceedNintendo's.   Another contender for market share is Sega of America Inc.,subsidiary of Japan's Sega Enterprises Ltd., veteran of videoarcades. Al Nilsen, director of marketing, says the company'sGenesis 16-bit system, which also will retail for around $200, hasgotten glowing reviews and orders from retailers are surpassingexpectations. Sega will start shipping Genesis in September.   Features that could give Sega an edge include the optionalTeleGenesis modem and software that will allow videophiles to linkthrough telephone lines and play video baseball against each other.Other games will be introduced next year for use with TeleGenesis.The price of TeleGenesis will be about $100 and using it will costthe price of a phone call.   Sega says Genesis will bring many of the popular arcadeclassics, such as Altered Beast, into the home and reproducearcade-quality graphics.   Nintendo claims it still can knock out the competition byintroducing dozens of hot games this year, including ``Tetris,'' agame designed in the Soviet Union, and ``Dragon Warrior.''   Also, Nintendo's hand-held Game Boy system with itsstate-of-the-art technology and stereo sound is expected to be ahit although toy industry analysts have speculated that theportable model could steal sales from regular Nintendo systems.   Nintendo has forecast sales this year at $2.6 billion, up from1988's $1.7 billion. The entire industry, Nintendo says, will postsales of $3.4 billion this year compared with $2.3 billion lastyear.   The deciding factor in how much market share competitors grabfrom Nintendo probably will be the games themselves, not thehardware.   Robert Holmes, chief operating officer of Acclaim EntertainmentInc., a major Nintendo software licensee, says most video gamedevelopers and marketers already have aligned themselves withNintendo.   Nintendo's devices are in an estimated 17 percent of Americanhouseholds and Nintendo projects its hardware will be in 26 percentof all U.S. homes by the end of this year.   ``Nintendo's position in the marketplace is akin to a tidalwave. They have the loyalty of the gaming public because of thediversity of the software,'' says Holmes, adding that NEC and Segalack a broad assortment of games.   NEC plans to have about 20 titles in stores by Christmas andSega expects to have 20 to 25.   Paul Valentine, a toy industry analyst at Standard andamp; Poor'sCorp., says the competition is intensifying at a time when themarket for the games could be peaking.   ``There is no question that the video game fad is reaching itspeak,'' says Valentine. But, he acknowledged: ``I underestimatedthe strength and duration of the video game fad in the past.''</TEXT><NOTE>End of Adv for Sunday, July 30 and thereafter.</NOTE></DOC>
