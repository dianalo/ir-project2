A scintillation dosemeter,an argon high pressure ionization chamber and a {gamma}-spectrometricsystem with both a NaI(Tl) detector and a semiconductor detector wereused. The evaluation of the dose rate from the measured spectra is describedas well as the calibration of the various measuring systems. The resultsof measurements in the vicinity of Brunsbuettel, Isar unit 1, Kruemmel,Philippsburg unit 1, Gundremmingen and Wuergassen, all BWRs are givenas well as results of measurements in the vicinity of the Biblis reactor(PWR). The measured dose rates differed for the various nuclear powerplants. All values were below the limits given in the German RadiationProtection Ordinance. At Biblis no N-16 radiation could be detected,not even close to the reactor. As expected, this was due to intensiveshielding of the N-16 radiation source. Additional measurements of doserate and integrated dose respectively were performed at Kruemmel usingTLD. The results show that the TLD-technique is a suitable and reliablemethod for measuring doses due to N-16.</TEXT></DOC>
