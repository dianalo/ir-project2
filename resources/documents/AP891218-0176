The bitter weather closed schools from Mississippi to Michigan,and forecasters said no change was in sight. The cold is beingcaused by a horseshoe-shaped flow of air that follows the WestCoast up to Alaska, chills out and plunges down through Canada intothe East and Midwest.   ``It's simply a pipeline that carries ... the cold airsouthward,'' said Ed Ferguson, deputy director of the federalgovernment's Severe Storms Forecast Center in Kansas City. ``And bysouthward, I mean all the way to the Gulf of Mexico.''   Southerners from central Mississippi to the Carolinas awokeMonday to a Yankee's vista of freezing rain and sleet that madedriving hazardous and was blamed for at least one traffic death.Hundreds of schools were closed.   The National Weather Service said as much as an inch of sleetand freezing rain covered north and central Georgia before dawn,and freezing rain extended as far south as Savannah.   Ice on Interstate 85 near Atlanta apparently contributed to acrash that killed Atlanta Falcons tight end Brad Beckman,authorities said.   At least 19 deaths around the nation were blamed on the coldduring the weekend, including the deaths of two young Tulsa, Okla.,girls who apparently were playing with a makeshift sled Sunday whenthey plunged through thin ice on a lake. Two homeless people diedof hypothermia while sleeping in New York City subway stations.   One weekend hypothermia death in Chicago brought to 10 thenumber of people who have died from exposure in the municipal areaso far this winter, said a spokeswoman for the Cook County MedicalExaminer's office.   A school bus carrying 43 children crashed into a station wagonon a slippery highway Monday near Shapleighl, Maine, but none ofthe children were seriously hurt, officials said.   Monday's cold broke Dec. 18 records that had held for more thana century in Columbus, Ohio, where it was minus 7; in Pittsburgh,where it also was 7 below, and in Detroit, where it was minus 3.   Other records included Parkersburg, W.Va., at 4 above,Cincinnati at 3 below, Fort Wayne, Ind., and Cleveland at minus 5,and Youngstown, Ohio, at minus 8.   ``Good night, it's been unreal,'' said Pam Decker, co-owner ofDecker's Wrecker Service in Boonville, Ind., which was besiegedwith calls about stalled and wrecked cars and the need tojump-start dead or dying car batteries.   The Missouri River turned to ice for about a 75-mile stretchbetween Blair, Neb., just north of Omaha, and Sioux City, Iowa,according to the National Weather Service.   The ice jam had begun late Friday and grew over the weekend.Officials feared that the ice floe could cause problems forcommunities that pump their water from the river, and WeatherService hydrologist Roy Osugi didn't hold out hope for an earlythaw.   ``Nothing is going to bust it up except warmer weather,'' Osugisaid. ``We think it's going to stay in place at least this weekbecause it's going to stay very cold.''   In St. Joseph, Mo., officials activated a new emergency pump asa precautionary measure to keep water flowing to the city.   There were similar problems in the town of Monroe, Mich., where55,000 water customers were asked to conserve while workers Mondaycleared a frozen intake valve that also was clogged with Lake Eriezebra mussels, a non-native species which has no natural predatorsand is proliferating in the lake.   In Crooksville, Ohio, officials declared a water emergency aftera series of water main breaks over the weekend. Parts of the smalltown had been without service for three days.   The cold also was the likely cause of a break in a 4-inch pipethat let water surge through all 12 floors of a new hospital atOhio State University in Columbus, causing at least $1 milliondamage and delaying its scheduled Jan. 16 opening, said OSU vicepresident Richard Jackson.   Farther west, the arctic weather system carried welcome snow toRocky Mountain ski resorts and wind chills of 35 below zero toparts of Wyoming. It was 26 below at Jordan, Mont., and hightemperatures in some parts of Montana were expected to be belowzero.   In Colorado, snowfall in the 24 hours that ended Monday morningincluded 4 inches at Denver, 16 inches at Vail and 9\ inches atSteamboat Springs _ which has gotten 99 inches in nine days, saidspokeswoman Barb Jennings.   At Denver's Stapleton International Airport, spokesman NormAvery said crews were out before daybreak, clearing 10 runways.However, he said flights were delayed up to an hour because of thesnow.   Ferguson, of the Severe Storms Forecast Center, said the outlookfor most of the country is for below-average temperatures for thenext month or so.   ``There's no promise that we can see in any of our projectionsthat we're going to have balmy weather in the middle of winter,''he said.</TEXT></DOC>
