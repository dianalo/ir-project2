A kid on a fancy bicycle ferried crack cocaine past a housingproject where the bullet-riddled body of a 34-year-old mother wasdiscovered before dawn. A squad car screamed by, blue lightspulsing. The owner of a furniture store looted in last January'sriots waited at the door for customers. He was armed.   Inside a small cement-block building set apart from the DrewElementary School, students in blue and white uniforms were toldtheir future is not necessarily foreshadowed by events on the otherside of the chain-link fence.   ``We let them know there are alternatives to drugs, to poverty,to crime,'' said Drew Principal Frederick Morley. ``The way out iseducation, literacy and skills. I think they're listening.''   The success of educators like Morley is vital not only to thepeople of Liberty City but to the nation as a whole.   As labor shortages arise, companies are hiring people fromdisadvantaged backgrounds out of necessity, not philanthropy. At thesame time, the knowledge-based economy demands more sophisticatedskills than ever.   Morley and others concede programs such as Drew's career-traininglaboratory are pitted against a Goliath. Years of disillusionmentand frustration rule the city's predominantly black inner-cityneighborhoods.   Nearly 300,000 Latin American refugees have entered Miami thisdecade, and American-born blacks complain that the immigrants arereceiving preferential treatment. The resentment was a catalyst in athree-day riot earlier this year in Liberty City, the third majorurban upheaval in Miami this decade.   ``We feel like the Indians out west. We were here first and thenewcomers are squeezing us out,'' said Tyrone Greene, 31.   Morley is focusing on the positive. In his school, ideals ofsuccess and perseverance are drilled into the 600 first- tosixth-grade students _ about a third of whom attend voluntarySaturday classes begun this year.   An 18-year-old career-planning lab at the school is a model forsimilar programs nationwide.   Each day, participating students punch simulated time cards andhead to an appointed task. At one end of the room, children tap outletters on electric typewriters while others as young as 7 work onpersonal computers. On the other side, boys and girls learn to sethair and apply cosmetics.   A real estate agent instructs children on property marketing asothers nearby study the rudiments of electronics or repairing anairplane wing.   They call each other ``Mr.'' and ``Mrs.''   ``We get them young enough so they aren't already locked into aself-defeating life of drugs or crime,'' said Morley, whose schoolhas received national awards and hosted Vice President Dan Quayle inFebruary.   ``When they leave this school, they are surrounded by all sortsof negative influences. We don't want their role models to be pimpsand dealers.''   While Morley shepherds children, Miami's black adults arelearning business skills from Philip Mann, whose round, white faceand shaggy mustache seems more suited to an Irish pub than a ghettostreetcorner.   ``I'm just trying to provide the tools _ the education _ to movein the right direction,'' said Mann, a University of Miami professorwho founded the Entrepreneurial Institute in response to LibertyCity riots in 1982.   The $15, five-week courses include accounting, internationalbusiness and business computer software. About two-thirds of the2,500 students who have taken them since 1983 are black.   ``There's an amazing resilience in the human species. The bodyand mind only lets you go so far into destitution, then the sense ofsurvival takes over,'' Mann said. ``That's what we're hoping to tapinto _ that sense that the black community will claw back againstthe odds.''   Education alone will not get blacks into the economic mainstreamin Miami. Among other things, they face discrimination from whiteand Hispanic businesses and a deterioration of the social fabric inblack communities.   ``Listen, I'll hire any one, but it seems the ones who can _ andwant _ to work are the Haitians and the Latins,'' said CharlesGenthner, president of Fire Hose Corp., which makes fire hoses in a1-year-old Liberty City plant.   ``There has to be the idea that getting into the work force isthe best option,'' said John Cordrey, an economist at the BeaconCouncil, a tax-supported Miami area business group.   ``In my opinion, the blacks have made the Hispanics a scapegoat.They see them working hard and they say they are taking our jobs,''said Thomas Boswell, a University of Miami professor studying localimmigration. ``What is really plaguing the black community here is abreakdown in the family.''   ``Identifying the problem is easy. Turning it around isdifficult.''</TEXT><NOTE>End adv for Sunday June 25</NOTE></DOC>
