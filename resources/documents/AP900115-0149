Leonid Abalkin, a vice premier and the Soviet's top economicreform official, told reporters here, ``If the situation on theconsumer market does not stabilize before the end of the year,other pretenders will try and seize power.''   Abalkin, who began a two-day private visit to the Netherlands,did not identify those thought to be waiting in the wings to unseatthe reform-minded faction in the Soviet leadership.   Speaking through a Dutch interpreter, he warned that ``those whorepeat the mistakes of the past years will not be able to play avanguard role in the reform process any more.''   Referring to Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, the Sovietofficial added, ``If there are great troubles with the economy, ifgoods disappear from the stores, a leader will lose his influencewith the population.''   Abalkin said that ``regrettably, many mistakes have been maderecently,'' citing errors or delays in the field of tax reform, andmanagement and planning system changes.   A radical plan to overhaul the ruined Soviet economy into amarket-oriented system _ a plan Abalkin helped co-author _ failedto be adopted by Gorbachev's government late last year.   Instead, a five-year economic plan submitted to the SupremeSoviet, the nation's working parliament, relied heavily on centralplanning, now held to be one of the major stumbling blocks tomeaningful economic reform.   Abalkin said that the strongly watered-down reform program was``the product of compromises and consensus. ... I think it's agreat victory that it has been achieved in such difficult times.''   He warned however that ``this plan must not remain another paperproject, there must be real changes in the economy.   ``If this government thinks that that is impossible, it shouldno longer take responsibility in the face of the parliament and thepeople,'' Abalkin said.</TEXT></DOC>
