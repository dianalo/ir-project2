Gorbachev is sending an unmistakeable signal thathe intends to seize the initiative during the pair's Moscowface-off.   The challenge facing Reagan as he awaits the start of the summitSunday is to maintain his well-rehearsed game plan _ or to alter itto compete with the Soviet leader.   The Soviets already have scrambled the schedule for the talksopening Monday and apparently imposed restraints on some of thepeople who hoped to meet with Reagan.</TEXT><DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Reagan, in his first visit to the Sovietcapital, will see an enormous city of 12-lane boulevards dominatedin part by seven massive Stalin-era Baroque buildings. He will seethe city at its best: the lilacs are blooming, the weather is mildand downtown stores are stocked with meat and tomatoes.   Arriving for the first time in the Soviet capital is at timeslike taking a trip back in time. The electrical appliances seemold-fashioned and traffic jams are rare, though smog has taken hold.   Nearly 9 million people live here, yet the only time it seemscrowded is when people are queuing to buy food, perfume, and otherscarce consumer goods. Humans are dwarfed by immense buildings,both the charmless, modern structures from the 1960s _ said to bemodeled on buildings Nikita Khrushchev saw and liked in New YorkCity _ and a variety of monuments to mother Russia's war heroes.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Senate on Friday ratified, 93-5, a treatyto abolish medium-range nuclear missiles, enabling President Reaganto present the pact to Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev at theirMoscow summit next week.   It was the first major U.S.-Soviet arms control accord ratifiedby the Senate since 1972.   Leading up to the ratification vote, the Senate rejected fourminor amendments offered by Republicans. That brought to 14 thenumber of amendments proposed by GOP conservatives and rejectedduring two weeks of floor consideration of the treaty.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Senate untied a 2-week-old knot Friday andpassed a Pentagon budget bill that grants the Pentagon wide-rangingnew powers to enter the war against illegal drug smugglers.   The nearly $300 billion bill was approved on a voice vote in amostly empty Senate chamber after Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y.,dropped his amendment that would have permitted the death penaltyto be imposed on drug dealers who are convicted of killing someone.   That amendment had stalled the measure for two weeks becausesupporters of the bill said the proposal would never be accepted bythe House. D'Amato's proposal will be considered as a separate billafter the Senate returns next month from its Memorial Day recess.</TEXT><DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Latin America appears to be ina quandary over Panama and its military ruler, Gen. Manuel AntonioNoriega.   The South and Central American nations that have espousedcivilian democratic governments after decades of military rule haveexpressed little regard for Noriega.   But, because of their own historical experience, they also lookunkindly on overt attempts by Washington to dictate who should runa country and how he should do it.   The little regional reaction to the breakdown in U.S.-Panamaniantalks aimed at Noriega's removal has been cautious and wavering.The talks involved an offer from the United States to dropdrug-trafficking charges against Noriega in exchange for hisremoval as Panama's leader.</TEXT><DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An unprecedented government order to includethe image of a deformed baby in packaging for the acne drugAccutane is unlikely to be followed by similar orders for otherdrugs with potential side-effects, analysts said Friday.   On Thursday, the drug's maker, Hoffman-La Roche Inc. of Nutley,released a Food and Drug Administration letter outlining stricterwarning requirements for the drug, which can cause life-threateningdamage to fetuses when taken by pregnant women.   Among other restrictions, the FDA also wants La Roche to providea consent form to be signed by physician and patient saying theyunderstand the risks associated with the drug.</TEXT><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   After a week in which New York City teacherswere bludgeoned, slashed, pummeled and blasted, their union leadercalled Friday for increased security and tougher sentences forteacher assaults.   ``One attack against a teacher is outrageous and to have four inone week is just intolerable,'' said United Federation of TeachersPresident Sandra Feldman. ``And we're afraid that this is just thetip of the iceberg.''   Though schools officials insisted the number of attacks onteachers had actually decreased in three years, Mayor Edward I.Koch said the city was concerned about teacher safety and he calleda ``summit meeting'' Tuesday of the chancellor, union leaders, thefive district attorneys and police commissioner to discuss theproblem.</TEXT><DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   In five weeks, Iraq has dramaticallyturned the tables on Iran with two major battlefield victories thathave aggravated Tehran's military and political troubles.   The military defeats have badly jolted Iran, which was alreadybeset by economic woes, a political power struggle between radicalsand conservatives, and growing international isolation.   ``There's a lot of confusion in Tehran now,'' said a Westerndiplomatic source with contacts in the Iranian capital. ``But theIranians will not take this lying down. They'll retaliate.''</TEXT><DATELINE>INGLESIDE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Watching ``Bullwinkle'' head into theGulf of Mexico on Friday brought tears to the eyes of some whoworked on the colossal offshore drilling platform that will betaller than Chicago's landmark Sears Tower.   ``We've worked hard for three years, and an event like this canbe somewhat emotional,'' said Gordon Sterling, Shell OffshoreInc.'s project manager for Bullwinkle. ``There were a few tearswatching it go by.''   After the 1,368-foot, 50,000-ton Bullwinkle settles on the oceanfloor off the Louisiana coast, workers will install a deck and twodrilling rigs, bringing the leviathan's weight to 78,000 tons andits height to 1,615 feet.</TEXT><DATELINE>ROCKFORD, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   There's no free lunch at Uncle Bob'sDiner. In fact there's no lunch at all _ no sunny side up, nofrench fries with gravy, no coffee.   The only food on Jerry Berta's menu nourishes the soul.   All that's cooking in the kitchen of what is now ``The DinerStore'' are other diners _ only smaller.   Berta, a 37-year-old sculptor, has been creating ceramic dinersfor 12 years _ from art-deco salt-and-pepper shakers to dinerseight inches high and 15 inches long, with working neon signs.   The diner-within-a-diner has fascinated Berta for years. But thechance to set up his gallery in Uncle Bob's Diner, believed to beMichigan's last remaining diner when it closed 15 years ago, wasmore than he had hoped for.</TEXT></DOC>
