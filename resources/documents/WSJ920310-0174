President Bush has a commanding lead in Republicandelegates, of course, but the campaign has made his problemclear. Everyone has understood all along that this is a yearof anger at incumbents; it's only now that the president'smen are starting to understand that he's one of theincumbents. Indeed, despite a suite in Texas for taxpurposes, he grew up inside the Beltway, the son of a U.S.senator, and remains a consummate insider in the politicaland social establishment.</LP><TEXT>   The president rubbed a lot of voters raw by backtrackingon his &quot;read my lips&quot; pledge. It's not so much that votersare selfish and wouldn't be willing to pay more in taxes ifthey got their money's worth. Mostly they're angry that theyhave no impact on an inbred ruling class. It's not as simpleas politicians always breaking their promises. Rather,campaign pledges are written in the wind, like no new taxes,when they constrain the power of the ruling class. But themost preposterous pledge, like no net loss of wetlands, isengraved in stone if it expands Beltway class power at theexpense of ordinary serfs.   Mr. Bush tipped his hat to the serfs, of course, by sayinghis budget deal was a mistake. But Budget Director RichardDarman has openly proclaimed the need for another budgetsummit after the election, when Remocrats and Depublicans cancut deals without interference from uppity voters. And thepresident's &quot;mistake&quot; comment came so off-handedly it didlittle to remove the suspicion that in a second term he'drevert to form.   Republican challenger Pat Buchanan taps the anger, butthen drowns it in pessimism. His ultimate message is thatAmericans can't handle the challenges of the world abroad, orthe challenges of modernity at home. We must seal ourselvesoff from the world with &quot;hardball&quot; trade tactics and BerlinWalls against immigrants. Funny-looking folks with strangehabits are to be seen as a threat, not as new pilgrims to theAmerican dream. Mr. Buchanan sounds the trumpet loud andclear, but the tune is retreat.   ---   On the Democratic side, Gov. Bill Clinton seems to haveheld his position as the choice of the Democratic Partyestablishment. But the salient aspect of his candidacy isthat he survived at the sufferance of the Washington presscorps. The press pack chose not to treat the Gennifer Flowerscharges the way the Seattle Times treated the accusationsagainst Sen. Brock Adams. Arguably this restraint was good,but it leaves candidate Clinton or President Clinton to walka mine field. The press has a fickle fuse.   Former Sen. Paul Tsongas beat death by bucking partydogma. If you're worried about global warming, for example,don't rule out nuclear power. Most of all, he has pointedlyabjured the class-warfare mantra sacred to the DemocraticParty establishment. It remains to be seen if this willreally sell in the party, or whether voters will find Mr.Tsongas's presence a sufficiently presidential one.   Jerry Brown made his mark by being not only outside theestablishment but out of bounds. Jay Leno says the Brownmessage is that the Japanese aren't our enemy; our real enemyis the Klingons. Primary voters in Colorado decided that hismessage pretty much expressed their own sentiments aboutpolitics.   At one point the Democratic race had a candidate withobvious common sense. Gov. Douglas Wilder got in, achievedthe purpose of establishing himself as vice-presidentialtimber, and got out without shedding blood or too much money.The voters whizzed by Sen. Bob Kerrey's anti-Japanese hockeygoalie, not to mention his national health plan. Sen. TomHarkin, billing himself as the only good old-fashionedDemocrat, pulled out just in time to beat Super Tuesdayvoters out of their chance to consign him to oblivion.   The message seems to be that old-fashioned big-government,blame-America-first Democrats can't hack it even withDemocratic primary voters. They continue to dominateCongress, it seems, and there's room to wonder whether aDemocratic president, once elected, would not also revert toform. How much faith should we put in the Tsongas death-bedconversion, let alone in a man married to someone expressingHillary Clinton's views?   ---   The remarkable thing about this year's national ticket,indeed, is that no one is claiming the position that wonthree presidential landslides in a row. Where is thecandidate who stands squarely for a smaller government athome and more leadership in the world? And who offers Yankeeoptimism about doing both, affirming the decency andgreatness of the American experiment?   What kind of candidate do we need to beat none of theabove? Someone not tarnished by opposition to the subduing ofSaddam Hussein, or perhaps even someone who would havesubdued him entirely. Someone not privy to the tax-boostingbudget deal, or at the very least who would apologize for itas politically necessary with Desert Storm impending. Someonewhose closet skeletons have been exhaustively vetted. Someoneable to attract a staff widely recognized as smarter thanhimself. Someone who gives us the sense that he would followhis own set principles despite various conventional wisdoms.Someone seen as not quite fit for admission to the Washingtonestablishment.   If we put a national candidate like that up against oldnone of the above, some press corps bigfeet might even stopfor reassessment. Come to think of it, one national candidatewas just reassessed in a seven-part series by David Broderand Bob Woodward. I guess the Washington Post stars are onceagain at the head of the pack. Scanning Super Tuesday'snational entrants, the obvious choice as class of the fieldis J. Danforth Quayle.   ---   Mr. Bartley is editor of the Journal.</TEXT></DOC>
