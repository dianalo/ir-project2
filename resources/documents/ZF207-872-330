 At the Exposition,this threshold gathered a near consensus from the exhibitors.andP;  Only a coupleof scanner vendors resisted the 256-level stampede; one of them (which wasmoving from 16 to 64 shades of gray) tried to convince us mathematically thateven high-resolution output devices can't use more than 6 bits of data per1/300 of an inch.andM;After our second eight-bit demo, these scanners began blending into a hazefrom which only a couple stood out.andP;  Hint to vendors: sexy image processingsoftware can sure help sell hardware.andM;Agfa Compugraphic featured the Focus II S800 GSE ($6,350), a new eight-bitgray-scale version of the six-bit, 800-dpi Focus S800 GS scanner (which hasbeen reduced from $5,495 to $4,350).andP;  The GSE also provided a showcase forthe company's new version of MC View Plus gray-scale image enhancementsoftware (see above).andM;Canon announced its new IX-30F 256-gray flatbed scanner that will comebundled with software (Hammerlabs' ScanDo on the PC, no announcement yet onthe Mac) for a list price of less than $1,500--evidence that prices forgray-scale scanners have quietly plummeted into the basement as color hasbecome the hot topic on the desktop.andP;  The IX-30F uses SCSI connections forboth Macs and PCs, a move that's becoming standard among scanner vendors.andP;  PCusers will have to pony up $100-$200 extra for the SCSI add-on board.andM;A few other vendors also showed eight-bit gray-scale scanners.andP;  Unlessotherwise indicated, these are 8-1/2&quot; X 11&quot;, 300-dpi flatbed units:andM;* Abaton--the Scan 300/GS for the PC and Mac ($1,795 each), plus an 8-bitupgrade kit ($695) for 4-bit Apple and Abaton scanners.andM;* Microtek--the MSF-300G ($2,195) and a 400-dpi version, the MSF-400G($3,995); there are also models of each that contain built-in SCSI interfacesand models for use with Sun workstations (ScanVu-300, $3,500; ScanVu-400,$5,000).andP;  Microtek also sells the new MSF-300Z scanner, which reads botheight bits of gray and 24 bits of color per pixel (see Color, above).andM;* New Dest--PC Scan 3000 models, which are sold as systems (with imagescanning and editing software and interfaces) for the PC ($2,095), MicroChannel Architecture machines ($2,195) and Macintosh ($1,995).andP;  Sheetfedmodels are also available.andM;* Truvel--the TZ-3 ($5,995), an open-table unit with an overhead tower scanengine.andP;  This model has 3,600 pixels per scan line; it can scan a 12&quot;-wideimage at 300 dpi, a 4&quot;-wide image at 900 dpi, or anywhere in between.andP;  A SCSIinterface costs $1,195; the TZ-3 can be upgraded to a TZ-3BWC unit, whichalso scans 24-bit color, for $3,995.andP;  (The TZ-3BWC costs $9,595; its SCSIinterface is $1,595.)andM;* Umax Data System--the UG80, an 8-1/2&quot; X 14&quot; unit bundled with ImageStudiofor the Macintosh or with Picture Publisher and an interface card for the PC;each package costs $2,190.andM;A scan in the hand.andP;  Another newly booming industry is handheld scanners,which appeared in a surprising number of booths.andP;  These tiny peripherals arejust the ticket for grabbing a graphic to throw into a document.andP;  As in anymarket, though, products that offer convenience and low prices also come withfunctional drawbacks (in this case, small scanning area, slow scanning and alarge opportunity for human error).andM;Two handheld scanners especially caught our eye.andP;  The Marstek Mars-128 ($299with HaloDTP image processing software) measures 5&quot; wide, a significant leapfrom the standard 4&quot; width.andP;  The extra inch enables it to scan an 8-1/2&quot;-widepage in two passes with a half-inch overlap, whereas 4&quot; scanners need threepasses.andP;  Marstek's competitors were quick to point out (and Marstek agreed)that a user who plans to scan many full pages should avoid handheld scannersand get a flatbed model.andM;The Mars-128 has 200 scan elements per inch, and it can scan at up to 400 dpiwith 32 gray levels by dithering.andP;  Its rated speed of three milliseconds perline is advertised as the highest scanning speed of any handheld model.andP;  Itis available now for use with PCs; a SCSI connection for Macintoshes will beshown at Comdex/Fall.andP;  A model with 400 scan elements per inch will bereleased later this year, one with 800 per inch next year.andP;  Marstek hopes torelease both color and &quot;real&quot; gray-scale hand-held scanners in the secondquarter of 1990.andM;Another bold newcomer is the Logitech ScanMan Plus, which boasts 400 scanelements per inch (as opposed to the original ScanMan's 200) and also claimsto read 32 gray levels.andP;  It was released just before the show.andP;  The PCversion costs $339; the Micro Channel version, $399.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
