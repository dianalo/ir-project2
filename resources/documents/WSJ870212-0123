It has a shell on top, a muscular foot beneath and the profile of a squished, aquatic toadstool.    Homely it may be, but this gastropod mollusk is a cherished item of California cuisine and the quest of a dwindling band of adventurers.    For commercial abalone divers, the pursuit of this increasingly rare delicacy demands considerable skill and stamina. And as Jay Worrell discovered, it can also be a nightmare.    Diving for abalone some years ago, Mr. Worrell sensed something squeezing him. &quot;At the start, it felt like a hug,&quot; he recalls. It wasn't. The embracing jaws of a great white shark soon crushed 4-inch-wide, razor-sharp teeth into his muscle and bones. In seconds, Mr. Worrell was badly wounded and the shark had departed, apparently startled by a burst of bubbles from the diver's severed air hose.    Fellow abalone hunters tell the tale with wry humor. &quot;Jay tasted so bad that that shark had to spit him out,&quot; says Randy Brannock. The victim himself shrugged off the incident and was working again barely six weeks later. The theory in the trade, another diver explains, is simple: &quot;If you don't like sharks, don't go in the ocean.&quot;    But more than sharks are biting at the abalone trade. The once-thriving business is disappearing. Along the California coast, where all of the nation's abalone trade is concentrated, pollution and a proliferating sea-otter population have reduced the catch to a little over 800,000 pounds a year from over four million pounds annually 25 years ago.    Prices have soared. Abalone meat is usually sliced and pounded into &quot;steaks,&quot; and prime steaks now run $30 and more wholesale per pound, compared with about $7 in 1974. Though once a popular fare in seafood restaurants throughout California, abalone is so expensive that it has disappeared from most menus.    &quot;I'd be happy to serve it, but the price is way too high, and I can't count on supplies,&quot; says Scott Bridges, the general manager of Dante's Sea Catch, a popular seafood restaurant in San Francisco.    Perhaps because of its rarity, abalone is treasured by gourmets. Traditionally, abalone steaks are fried, sometimes after being breaded. The result is a rich, buttery but subtle dish, with a taste like a delicate calamari. &quot;I love it,&quot; says Pierre Franey, who writes the &quot;60-Minute Gourmet&quot; column in the New York Times; he also favors abalone sauteed with basil and fresh tomatoes. In Oriental cuisine, abalone usually is steamed with vegetables. And aside from its value as food, the abalone is sought after for its shell, which is lined with mother-of-pearl.    Abalone divers are growing as scarce as their quarry. Two decades ago, 850 commercial permits were issued to harvest abalone. Now, only 120 divers hold permits, of whom perhaps a few dozen work full time.    The dangers of their trade make abalone divers the elite of the fisheries fleet. They are also a breed apart. &quot;They're often people who don't feel comfortable with society; they like being alone on the ocean,&quot; says Peter Howorth, a historian, chronicler of abalone tales and former diver.    Few have trained formally for underwater work. Some are flower children of the '60s who took up diving to make money. (Top abalone divers may gross upward of $75,000 in a good year.) Some drifted into the trade because they had little else to do or because they loved diving. Merrill Jacobs relates that he was studying for a doctorate in political science, &quot;which led directly to a career as an abalone diver.&quot;    In the chilly waters of the Pacific, abalone diving &quot;is like an underwater Easter-egg hunt,&quot; explains Mr. Brannock. The mollusks hide in kelp beds or between rocks or graze slowly across the bottom.    A diver may spend as much as seven or eight hours a day at depths from 10 feet to nearly 200 feet, encased in a wet suit for warmth; he breathes through a light mouthpiece attached by a long hose to a compressor on a boat. The water often is murky. And decompression sickness, or the bends, is a constant risk.    Tradition holds that divers' boats don't work too closely to one another. In the rough-and-tumble divers' world, a breach of the rule can mean war. Authorities recently were summoned when a diver fired a gun at a nearby competitor.    The boom years for abalone divers were the 1950s and '60s. Catches reached record numbers. Diving was dominated for much of that time by the &quot;Black Fleet,&quot; a group of boats and crews that worked for a single abalone-processing operation. The fleet was as tough as its name. &quot;It was like Hell's Angels coming to town,&quot; says Mr. Howorth of the fleet's periodic bar-hopping sprees.    When independent entrepreneurs gained the upper hand in the 1960s, the rowdiness remained. Drunks, drug users, and felons were part of the business, divers say. Waterfront arrests were frequent. &quot;I used to wonder how they could get out of jail with a big hangover and go diving the same day,&quot; recounts Kirby Duncan, a police lieutenant in Santa Barbara, Calif., where much of the abalone fleet is based.    Lean times have weeded out the trade's marginal practitioners. &quot;The divers who are left are serious; there aren't any novices around,&quot; says Mary Stein, one of the few women ever to dive for abalone commercially.    This is not to say that divers today never break the law. There are strict rules governing where, when and at what size abalone may be harvested. And as the value of the mollusk has mounted, poaching has been on the rise.    To catch miscreants, fish and game agents have resorted to ingenious tricks. Some years ago, one officer concocted a hollow &quot;rock&quot; to observe from. &quot;You'd see it on shore, near shallow abalone beds,&quot; says diver Gary Johnson. &quot;Once in a while the rock would move down the beach, looking like something out of a bad cartoon.&quot;    But given the vastness of the ocean they must cover, law officials face a nearly impossible task, &quot;It's a cat-and-mouse game where you lose 999 times out of 1,000,&quot; says Daniel Boczek, a former warden.    With a dwindling supply of harvestable abalone, biologists and entrepreneurs are struggling to raise the mollusk under controlled conditions ashore. The problem is that shore-grown abalone are small and make a better cocktail snack than a meal.    It is possible, however, that most abalone for human consumption will one day have to be grown ashore. The reason is a competing abalone-lover: the sea otter, whose playful, endearing ways have won it political support and extensive legal protection. A plan is afoot now to colonize with sea otters an offshore island that now holds prime abalone beds.    Abalone divers, who are rarely inclined to the niceties of political debate, are fighting a last-ditch effort to halt the move. &quot;Nobody knows we're here,&quot; laments Mr. Brannock, who heads the group's tiny lobbying campaign. Indeed, he suggests that the divers' tough, unconstrained ways may prove their undoing. If the abalone trade disappears, Mr. Brannock offers this epitaph: &quot;We were independent to the point of extinction.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
