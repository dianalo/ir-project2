 Software developersdidn't immediately grasp the notion that 900 lines also could be used to billcustomers for fee-paid tech support Calls--but the idea finally seems to becatching on.andP;  Already this year, at least three companies--Aldus, Lotus, andButtonware--have announced new 900-line programs.andP;  Dozens of other plans, wesuspect, will be unveiled in the next year or so.andM;To get a better sense of how 900-line service will affect the softwareindustry, we talked with tech support and marketing managers from the threesoftware companies that have broken the ice in this area.andP;  So far, we found,nobody has much real operating experience with 900 lines.andP;  Buttonware is theonly company that has actually put a 900-line support program in place, andButtonware's experience is barely three weeks old.andP;  Aldus expects to activateits new 900-line service as this issue goes to press, and Lotus is stillworking on the details of what it describes as a &quot;pilot program.&quot;andM;Nevertheless, all three companies have invested a fair amount of time inresearching and planning their 900-line services.andP;  Here's what we found arethe key issues:andM;*  Customer acceptance.andP;  will 900-line charges antagonize customers?andM;All three companies worried about this issue, but apparentlyandM;there isn't much resistance to the idea of fee-paid support.andM;Aldus's director of customer service, John Archdeacon, told usandM;his support technicians polled callers for several months aboutandM;a 900 line.andP;  &quot;They were surprised at how many customers wereandM;willing to pay.&quot; Jim McMullen, Lotus's director of customerandM;support, says one goal of his pilot program is to measureandM;acceptance &quot;before we go off the deep end,&quot; but he adds thatandM;&quot;early indications have been pretty favorable.&quot; And ButtonwareandM;marketing manager Dee Dee Walsh says that in the first threeandM;weeks of operation, her company's 900-line program has generatedandM;only one serious complaint.andP;  &quot;We talked for a while, and even heandM;wasn't absolutely roasted by what we were doing.&quot;andM;* Price.andP;  Buttonware's program charges callers at a rate ofandM;$1/minute, with the first minute free.andP;  Lotus hasn't set a firmandM;price yet, but McMullen says the rate will probably be &quot;in theandM;vicinity&quot; of $2/minute.andP;  Aldus's pricing is the most interesting:andM;Callers are charged a flat $15 regardless of the length of theandM;call.andP;  Archdeacon explains that the $15 figure is based on anandM;average call length of ten minutes, so the effective rate isandM;about $1.50 a minute.andP;  &quot;I didn't want us to get into the issue ofandM;how long it takes us to answer a question,&quot; he says.andP;  &quot;SometimesandM;I'll win, and sometimes I'll lose.&quot;andM;* Profitability.andP;  The cost of a 900 line varies considerably,andM;depending on which telephone company provides the service.andP;  AldusandM;pays MCI 25 cts/minute plus $1.50 per call.andP;  Walsh says ButtonwareandM;pays 60 cts-70 cts a minute to US West.andP;  (&quot;The phone company's makingandM;out like a bandit,&quot; she says.).andP;  Lotus uses ATandamp;T and won'tandM;comment on the price it pays, though McMullen says Lotus's termsandM;came straight off the ATandamp;T rate card.andP;  In addition, most 900-lineandM;service vendors charge monthly minimums and fairly steep set-upandM;charges.andP;  In a few cities, we've found that 900-line brokers canandM;provide smaller customers with more flexibility than they get inandM;dealing direct with Ma Bell and her sisters.andP;  But our guess isandM;that competition among phone companies will very quickly forceandM;prices down to more attractive levels.andM;* Service standards.andP;  Walsh says one reason Buttonware decided toandM;try a 900 line was that the company's free support service hadandM;reached a crisis situation, but we couldn't afford to keepandM;growing the support department.&quot; The company's phone lines wereandM;choked, and Walsh says the support staff spent most of its timeandM;fielding questions about DOS and non-Buttonware titles.andP;  Now thatandM;Buttonware is charging for support by the minute, she points outandM;that quality standards have to be higher.andP;  one solution, sheandM;says, is to make sure callers are never put on hold.andP;  &quot;They'llandM;get a busy signal if everybody's occupied--though so far nobodyandM;has hit a busy signal yet.&quot;andM;* Fit with other plans.andP;  All three companies say they'll continueandM;to offer some form of free support, supplemented by alternativeandM;forms of paid support.andP;  Buttonware says it will honor its formerandM;policy of a year of free support for products purchased in 1989;andM;starting in 1990, however, the free support period will drop toandM;90 days.andP;  Aldus has revamped its entire support program and nowandM;provides 90 days of free support (up from 45 days), plus aandM;choice of annual contracts priced between $89 and $149.andP;  LotusandM;offers six months free, then a choice of contracts priced at $49andM;and $79.andP;  Archdeacon points out that only about 25% of Aldus'sandM;support calls come from customers who aren't covered by theandM;initial free support period or paid contracts.andP;  &quot;We estimate thatandM;about half of these people will opt for 900 service,&quot; he says.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
