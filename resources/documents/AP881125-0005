(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Despite moves elsewhere to restrictsmoking, the tobacco industry holds a powerful home-turf advantagein Kentucky, where efforts to spell out non-smokers' rights havetaken a pounding.   The latest target for the industry and its allies in theLegislature is a proposed smoking policy at the University ofLouisville. Some key lawmakers have hinted the school may be hit inthe pocketbook if it grants certain rights to non-smokers.   In June, the Owensboro City Commission rescinded a newly enactedban on smoking in municipal buildings after a tobacco companythreatened to reconsider plans to expand a plant there.   Last year, the heat was on officials of the Greater CincinnatiInternational Airport in northern Kentucky. Some lawmakersthreatened to revoke the airport's Sunday liquor license if asmoking ban was fully implemented there.   ``Tobacco is such an ingrained part of the social, economic andpolitical structure of this entire state, it's hard for people fromnon-tobacco states to understand,'' said Mike Staufacker, healtheducation director for the American Lung Association of Kentucky.   ``I'm a little bit embarrassed by what the state legislators aretrying to do,'' he said. ``It really sheds a poor light on thestate.''   In North Carolina, the nation's leading tobacco grower, therehave been few moves to legislate restrictions on smoking, althoughsome bus companies and restaurants have instituted no-smokingsections. In September, the Research Triangle Institute won a $4million National Cancer Institute contract for a study in Raleighand Greensboro that will use advertising and community support toget smokers to quit.   Kentucky, the nation's top burley tobacco producer, had thecountry's highest smoking-related death rate in 1985, the U.S.Centers for Disease Control reported last week. Staufacker saidanother recent study showed 32 percent of all Kentuckians smoke, thehighest rate among 30 states surveyed.   The chairman of the Legislature's Tobacco Task Force, Rep. DonnieGedling, said that total income from tobacco in Kentucky was $2.3billion in 1984 and that the crop is a mainstay for many of thestate's 120,000 small farmers.   ``We're talking about a $2 billion industry out here,'' saidstate Rep. Clay Crupper, an opponent of smoking regulations andchairman of the House Agriculture Committee. ``We ought not to beout stopping smoking here and stopping smoking there.''   Crupper is among several lawmakers angry about the University ofLouisville's proposed smoking regulations, especially a portion thatsays in the case of an impasse between smokers and non-smokers,non-smokers' rights prevail.   The rules would prohibit smoking in hallways and common areas,divide eating areas into smoking and non-smoking sections andregulate smoking in offices on the urban campus, where 22,000students are enrolled.   Crupper said last week the Legislature ``might have to cutsomething out'' of the school's budget if no compromise is reached.Another alternative would be to enact legislation barringuniversities from regulating smoking in state-owned buildings,Crupper said.   Donald Hall, a university spokesman, told a meeting of theTobacco Task Force on Nov. 20 that he understood the legislators``loud and clear.'' Hall said later that Donald Swain, theuniversity president, was considering changes in the proposedsmoking policy.   ``There is a sense that the present draft may be skewed a littlemore toward the non-smoker than the smoker,'' Hall said. ``So, weare trying to develop some language that is a little moreeven-handed.''   Hall said he doubted the university would back down completelybut probably would amend the provisions governing deadlocks indisputes over smoking zones. He said he did not believe the school'sbudget had been seriously threatened.   ``I guess the intensity of the reaction from some quarters was alittle surprising,'' Hall said. ``But we know how important thetobacco industry is to the state, and we certainly do not want toget into a conflict with the General Assembly.''   Many Louisville students said they resented the threats to thebudget.   ``The tobacco industry is pulling the strings, and the Universityof Louisville is dancing,'' said Gregory Hall, a non-smokingpolitical science major.   John Jaynes, a graduate student who smokes, said he thought theproposed policy would be overly restrictive but that legislators'threats were ``petty'' and ``vindictive.''   Brett Edwards, whose relatives raise tobacco near Bloomfieldsoutheast of Louisville, said he opposed the policy and supportedwhatever steps were necessary to block the measure.   ``You have to protect your business interests any way you can,''Edwards said, taking quick puffs from a cigarette.</TEXT></DOC>
