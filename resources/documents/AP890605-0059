At the same time, Iranian rebels based in Iraq shut down theirpropaganda machine in what diplomats suspect was an Iraqi move tomuzzle them in a goodwill gesture to Tehran.   In Baghdad's first official reaction to Khomeini's death onSaturday, the al-Thawra daily said: ``Iraq once again calls ... fora comprehensive and just peace based on good neighborly relationsand non-interference in each other's internal affairs.''   Iran and Iraq declared a cease-fire in their eight-year war inAugust 1988, but have not concluded a peace treaty.   The newspaper, mouthpiece of the ruling Baath Socialist Party,said in an editorial that the ``death of Khomeini means the passingof a vicious despot who spared no effort to fulfill his dream ofbuilding a Persian empire at the expense of Iraq and other Arabnations.''   It warned that Khomeini's death will trigger a ``chapter ofstruggle among different factions'' in Tehran.   But it stressed that Iraq ``is looking forward to the new rulersworking for a peace settlement to the gulf war and new relationsbased on non-interference.''   The army-run al-Jomhuriya daily noted that Khomeini's death has``opened the gates'' for peace between the two Persian Gulfneighbors.   Iraq has repeatedly charged that peace talks to formally end thePersian Gulf war have deadlocked because political feuding inTehran has paralyzed Iran's decision-making.   The editorials clearly reflected Baghdad's hopes that a moreflexible leadership will emerge in Tehran following Khomeini'sdeath.   The Mujahedeen Khalq, or People's Holy Warriors, announced inBaghdad that in the wake of Khomeini's death, they have haltedpublication of their magazines, shut down their television stationin Iraq that beams propaganda into western Iran and called offanti-Khomeini demonstrations in world capitals planned for June 20.   The Mujahedeen noted, however, that their radio station, theVoice of Mujahed, will continue broadcasting 16 hours a day.   The group, the main Iranian opposition movement, said in astatement the actions were ``part of efforts to make ever-greaterpreparations to overthrow the remnants of Khomeini's regime.''   But diplomats in Baghdad said it appeared that the shutdown wasmore likely ordered by the Iraqi government to minimize Mujahedeenpropaganda and encourage Iranian leaders to respond to Iraq's peacecall.   The diplomats said that was the only explanation for theMujahedeen action at a time when they had been expected tointensify their propaganda to exploit the political uncertainty inIran.   Mujahedeen officials said Sunday that their military arm, theNational Liberation Army of Iran, was ready to return to Iran tooverthrow the Tehran government ``at the appropriate time.''   There was no indication that the army, with a strength estimatedat more than 20,000 fighters, was preparing military action.</TEXT></DOC>
