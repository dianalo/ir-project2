The order was made public in a joint statement byMinneapolis-based Cray and the Pittsburgh center, which is a jointventure of the University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon Universityand Westinghouse Electric Corp.   ``We think proteins are the key to biochemistry and we want toestablish the foremost protein research center in the countryhere,'' Carnegie Mellon President Cyert said. ``One of the mostcritical elements is the supercomputer center.''   As part of a contract, the center will make a $10 million downpayment for the $25 million machine, which is not scheduled fordelivery until the third quarter of 1990.   Cray officials said this was the first time the company hadcommitted itself to selling a specific supercomputer so early indevelopment, and they admitted being concerned because of the greatamount of work remaining to be done.   ``There's no reason to believe that we will not be successful,''said Edward A. Masi, Cray's vice president of marketing. ``But younever know until you ship the product.''   The machine, to be known as the Cray 3, is expected to be theworld's most powerful supercomputer, capable of speeds at leastthree times as fast as today's quickest machine. It also would bethe first commercial computer to be based on gallium arsenide,rather than on silicon microelectronics.   Cray hopes to have a prototype ready for testing by the end ofthis year.   Under terms of its contract with Cray, the Supercomputing Centerwill first purchase a Cray Y-MP, a machine introduced in February.The Y-MP, capable of 2.6 billion calculations per second, will betraded in for the Cray 3 when that machine is ready.   After accounting for that trade-in and another on a Cray X-MPthat the center already owns, the entire contract will be worthabout $30 million, Cyert said.   Cray executives acknowledge difficult problems must besurmounted before the Cray 3 can be built.   Cyert said the Supercomputing Center's contract contains anumber of escape clauses if Cray cannot meet certain target dates.   The Cray 3 is the latest creation of Seymour Cray, the computerdesigner who founded Cray Research in 1972. If the machine fulfillsits promise, it will represent the fifth time that Cray has set anew standard for computer speed and power.   He has said the new computer, under development for six years,will make as many as 16 billion calculations per second. That is 10times as fast as his last machine, the Cray 2, and at least threetimes as fast as the ETA-10, made by ETA Systems Inc., a ControlData Corp. subsidiary.   Cray Research is turning to gallium arsenide for itssemiconductor chips because electricity passes through the compoundmore rapidly than through silicon and dissipates less quickly. Theresult is a faster chip that uses less power. It also produces lessheat, allowing chips to be more densely packed into the machine.   Gallium arsenide computer chips have been used in semiconductortesting equipment and specialized military equipment. But the Cray3 ``is the farthest anyone has gone'' in the commercial field, saidGene Miles, president of Aztek Associates, a technology consultingfirm.   Officials of the Supercomputing Center said they ordered theY-MP and the Cray 3 to assure that researchers would have the mostadvanced computers.   The 3-year-old Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center is one of fivesuch centers established around the country with financing from theNational Science Foundation.</TEXT></DOC>
