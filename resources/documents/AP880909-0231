The proposed prohibitions, opposed by the administration, arecontained in the fiscal 1989 spending bill for the InteriorDepartment, U.S. Forest Service and some Energy Department researchprograms.   The $9.9 billion appropriations package is heading toward thepresident's desk following its approval by Congress on Thursday.The Senate passed it by voice vote; the House endorsed it on a359-45 roll call.   The margin of approval in the House indicates the legislationhas sufficient support to ensure its backers could win aveto-override vote.   The bill would continue, through September 1989, a ban onInterior Department sales of oil leases off the coasts of northernCalifornia and Massachusetts and reinstitute a drilling ban for thewaters off southwestern Florida.   This would stop the administration from holding lease sales forthese areas during its final months in office. Both presidentialcandidates _ Republican George Bush and Democrat Michael Dukakis _have said they oppose petroleum development in sensitive offshorewaters.   Dropped from the compromise package was a House provision, alsodrawing fire from the administration, that sought to require atleast 50 percent U.S. labor and materials for petroleum facilitiesalong the outer continental shelf.   The spending bill, which contains no major new programs, wouldprovide $190 million for the Energy Department's clean-coalresearch efforts in fiscal 1989, which begins Oct. 1.   This is $335 million less than the administration said it neededto fulfil President Reagan's pledge to Canada to spend $2.5 billionover five years in a search for ways to curb U.S. emissions ofpollutants that cause acid rain.   In a letter to lawmakers last month, James C. Miller III,director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, citedthe refusal of Congress to commit $525 million to the clean-coalprogram in fiscal 1989 as another reason the bill might be vetoed.   Since then, however, administration officials and congressionalleaders have discussed their differences and may be near anagreement that could make the partial funding acceptable to theWhite House, according to an administration source who spoke oncondition of anonymity.   Miller also has objected to giving states more than $150 millionfor energy conservation programs, which he said should not befederally financed. His letter also complained about putting morethan $60 million into Indian health facilities when existingfacilities have a 50 percent vacancy rate.   The bill calls for the National Park Service to receive $1billion in fiscal 1989, some $280 million more than Reagan proposedin his budget and about $100 million higher than fiscal 1988.   The U.S. Forest Service would receive $1.84 billion in fiscal1989, an increase of about $625 million over the current level andabout $230 million more than the administration requested.   The bill sets a goal of selling 11.45 billion board feet oflumber from public forests, 198 million more board feet than theadministration proposed. Road-building money would total about $176million, down some $20 million from fiscal 1988.</TEXT></DOC>
