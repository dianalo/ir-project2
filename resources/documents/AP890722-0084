Rep. Gerry E. Studds, D-Mass., a senior member of the HouseMerchant Marine and Fisheries Committee who pushed for thenegotiations, said he fears the disputes _ with each side accusingthe other of border cheating _ will end in tragedy.   ``If this keeps up, someone is going to get killed,'' saidStudds, a critic of the Canadians' aggressive gun-pointing pursuitsof American fishing vessels spotted on the Canadian side of GeorgesBank off the Northeast coast.   ``Clearly we have had some U.S. fishermen who have stretchedtheir luck, probably knowingly,'' the congressman said in a recentinterview. ``We do not condone that. But even in those cases, wedon't believe there is an excuse for armed force the way theCanadians are doing.''   Edward E. Wolfe, deputy assistant secretary of state for oceansand fisheries affairs, agrees that the current situation risks``more serious incidents and possibly loss of life.''   Several days after meeting with Studds, Wolfe invited officialsat the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans to a series ofmeetings on the growing border tensions. The meetings are scheduledfor July 31, Aug. 1 and Aug. 2.   Wolfe, in an interview last week, said the bilateral meetingswould cover ``the whole range of legal, navigational and lawenforcement issues.''   While the Canadians are expected to accept the invitation towhat Wolfe described as an ``urgent meeting,'' differences over theborder patrols remain deep.   ``There's always room to maintain an open dialogue on ways inwhich (the patrols) might be handled. But that's not to say thereis anything wrong at the present,'' said a Canadian Embassyofficial who has followed the dispute.   Studds, whose Cape Cod and southeastern Massachusetts districtrelies heavily on commercial fishing, believes many of the bordercrossings by U.S. vessels are ``honest mistakes.''   Jeff Pike, an aide to the congressman, said five of the sixnavigational charts issued to American fishermen by the NationalOceanic and Atmospheric Administration contain U.S.-Canadian bordererrors of up to four miles.   That, along with differences in readings from navigationalequipment in the two countries, can account for many of the bordercrossings, Studds said.   The Canadian government, however, maintains that the U.S.fishermen are knowingly entering Canadian waters to get an edge incompetitive fishing markets.   ``We certainly believe they're crossing the borderdeliberately,'' said Hugh Trudeau, director of Atlantic operationsfor the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans.   The disputes stem from an International Court of Justicedecision in 1984 establishing a border to separate the twocountries' marine zones. Before the border was established, a``disputed zone'' existed where fishermen from both countriesfished side by side.   Canada's tough marine enforcement was highlighted last year whenCanadian patrols fired at the Donna Lynn, a New Bedford, Mass.,scalloper, after the vessel's captain refused to let officials onboard. The captain claimed his boat was in U.S. waters.   Recently, another New Bedford boat was pursued by Canadianpatrols for 14 hours.</TEXT></DOC>
