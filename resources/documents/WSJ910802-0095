The Department of Energy, which sponsored the project,says the process is the first to convert coal-derived gasesinto dimethyl ether, or DME, in one step. DME is used to makeoxygen-rich additives for gasoline to reduce vehicleemissions. Recent changes in the Clean Air Act require that25% of U.S. gasoline contain such &quot;oxygenates&quot; by 1995.   Gary Voelker, director of the Energy Department's officeof coal conversion, says natural gas, petroleum and ethanolhave generally been considered the most practical startingpoints for oxygenates. But the department's project shows itis feasible to make these additives &quot;from the nation's moreabundant coal reserves,&quot; he says.   Previously, processing oxygenates from coal was toocostly. Coal-derived gases had to be synthesized intomethanol, which was then dehydrated to form DME. Under thenew technique, the entire process takes place in a singlevessel, eliminating costly steps and equipment.   Mr. Voelker cautions that he hasn't yet estimated howoxygenates made with the new process compare in cost withadditives from other materials. The process was developed bychemists from Air Products andamp; Chemicals at a Pittsburghfacility owned by the Energy Department.                                                                                                          New Theory Advances   On How Metals Interact                                                                                                          RESEARCHERS revise their understanding of how metal atomsmove about when deposited on metal surfaces.   The finding may eventually help engineers createsophisticated &quot;tailor-made&quot; materials for use in electronicsand optical devices, according to researchers at SandiaNational Laboratories in Albuquerque, N.M.   In recent years, materials engineers have tried to developnew materials by spraying one metal on another, one atom at atime. The process creates materials with properties foundneither in natural metals nor in alloys formed by meltingdifferent metals together.   This research differs from that announced by InternationalBusiness Machines last month involving silicon, which isn't ametal. The IBM researchers found a way to place individualsilicon atoms at precise locations, while materials engineershave been trying to understand and predict how metalsinteract.   Conventional wisdom has held that when one metal isdeposited on the surface of another, the atoms of thedeposited metal roll about like marbles till they find aniche and form permanent bonds.   Peter Feibelman, a Sandia physicist, came to a differentconclusion after using a supercomputer to model the behaviorof aluminum atoms. His analysis predicted that a depositedatom wouldn't roll about on the surface of another metal, butrather would dive into the surface layer and displace an atomfrom it.   Gary Kellogg, a physicist at Sandia, and Tien Tsong ofPennsylvania State University tested Mr. Feibelman's theoryon aluminum, platinum, nickel and iridium using an imagingtechnique known as field-ion microscopy. Their testssupported his theory.   Mr. Feibelman cautions that experiments with other metalsmay support the rolling-marble theory. In any event, he says,the understanding of how metal atoms behave when deposited onother metals may help materials engineers develop newcatalysts, high-strength materials, efficient X-ray mirrorsand magnetic materials for data storage.                                                                                                          Small Device Measures   Faint Magnetic Fields                                                                                                          PHYSICISTS at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in Berkeley,Calif., have developed what they call the first practicaldevice to measure faint magnetic fields.   The instrument, made of high-temperature superconductingmaterials, is capable of detecting magnetic signals that areone hundred millionth the strength of the earth's magneticfield. Such low magnetic signals are emitted by the heart andthe brain as part of these organs' normal electricalactivity.   The ability to measure such faint signals could have manyuses, from medical diagnosis to oil exploration, says JohnClarke, a physicist who led the development of the device.&quot;These aren't proven techniques yet,&quot; he says, but &quot;therewill be serious applications in relatively short time.&quot;   It isn't the first time that anyone has measured such lowmagnetic fields. Mr. Clarke says the Soviets demonstrated adevice with similar capability a few years ago, but it was&quot;too bulky&quot; to be practical. He says his group's instrumentconsists of thin films of a high-temperature superconductor,made of yttrium, barium and copper oxide, and is so smallthat it can be cooled to superconducting temperatures in anordinary thermos containing liquid helium.                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          AGRICULTURE Department microbiologists say they havedevised a cheaper, simpler way to detect two majorfood-poisoning bacteria, salmonella and listeria. Foodprocessors now incubate food samples for 24 hours in separate&quot;broths,&quot; or growth media, for each bacterium. Theresearchers have developed a single broth of protein, sugarand salt in which both bacteria can thrive. The new methodcould save processors $5 million to $7 million a year with noloss in accuracy, the researchers say. . . . Another group ofAgriculture Department researchers says it has found inshrimp and crab shells a substance, called chitosan, thatdisables enzymes that turn fruit juices brown.</TEXT></DOC>
