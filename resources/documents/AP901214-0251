Cars honked, but Martin didn't budge. The native Chicagoan wasnear her old neighborhood, and like most politicians in that brawnytown she wasn't ready to yield an inch.   ``Not mine!'' she told the man, who said her Senate campaign adswere nasty. ``Usually before you hang somebody you have someevidence.''   Her accuser was not convinced. Voters were not sold on hereither. Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., crushed the Republican challengerin a 980,000-vote landslide that even swept Martin's home county,Winnebago.   Soon to be out of work for the first time in her 18-yearpolitical career, Martin accepted an invitation Friday to joinPresident Bush's Cabinet as Labor Department secretary, replacingElizabeth Dole.   Simon immediately jumped on her bandwagon.   ``I will vote for her and I wish her the very best,'' he said.The Senate must confirm the appointment.   Despite representing Rockford, a blue-collar city that isIllinois' second-largest, Martin never forged any ties to organizedlabor during her 10 years in the House.   Business groups gave her $358,439 in campaign contributions from1983 through 1988. Labor groups donated only $3,900.   ``I, of course, am pro-business,'' Martin said earlier thisyear. ``I think pro-business is pro-worker.   ``It isn't a belief that business should always be protected. Inthings like the environment, who should be hired - there are a lotof things that business has to do a lot better with,'' she said.   In one of the most significant business-labor debates of 1988,Congress passed a bill requiring a 60-day notice of large layoffsor plant closings. Martin voted no.   ``The smaller companies who would be forced to give that 60-daynotice would find themselves losing virtually all credit and anychance to survive,'' she said.   Judith Lynn Morley Martin was born in Chicago on Dec. 26, 1939.A graduate of the University of Illinois, she taught high schooleconomics, government and English before beginning her publiccareer with a race for Winnebago County Board in 1972.   Four years later, she was elected to the Illinois House, and in1978 the Illinois Senate. When John B. Anderson ran for presidentin 1980, voters promoted Martin to the U.S. House, where she wasre-elected four times.   Declaring that Simon was too liberal for Illinois, Martin ranfor Senate this year. But she was never able to overcome hisstatewide popularity, match his $8 million campaign chest ordevelop a clear campaign theme.   Perhaps her favorite achievement in Congress, she said, was aHouse rule that established an anti-discrimination program. TheOffice of Fair Employment Practices mediates disputes betweenlawmakers and their staff members.   ``It was a giant step forward,'' Martin said in August. ``Younow see women who are administrative assistants. ... Minoritieshave a chance to complain if they feel there is racial prejudice.''   Few laws, however, carry her name.   ``The fact is it's a Democratic majority,'' she said of theHouse, ``so that means you have to be more concerned with gettingwhatever you want done in the process.   ``I think people would suggest I'm pretty good at that.''</TEXT></DOC>
