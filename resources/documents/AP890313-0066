National Guard Guard</HEAD><DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   South Carolina's Army National Guard isworried too many soldiers can't read well enough to understand themanuals for such high-tech weapons as the HAWK missile, Apacheattack helicopter and the M1 Abrams battle tank.   The training manuals are written for 10th-graders, but 40 percentof the enlistees tested read at the ninth-grade level or below,according to recent tests.   Adjutant Gen. T. Eston Marchant estimated that 25 percent ofthose reading at the ninth-grade level or below work in high-techspeciality areas or will when the Guard finishes its modernizationprogram.   ``There is no way Guardsmen reading at the fourth-grade level canget trained for using that equipment much less read the fieldmanuals,'' said Marchant, who commands the state's 15,400 Army andAir National Guardsmen.   He said the situation is embarrassing, but added: ``We have nochoice. It's either a matter of not being able to man, field andfunction as a military unit or trying to do something about it.''   To close the gap, the Guard is encouraging enlistees to enroll inadult education classes to improve their reading, officials said.   The reading program does not affect the state's Air NationalGuard.   The Guard will give reading tests to 12,798 enlisted personnel bythe summer, said Maj. Bill Power, Guard spokesman. As of February,tests given to 6,793 enlistees showed that 40 percent were readingat the ninth-grade level or below.   Sixty percent of the Guard's enlistees read well enough tocomprehend weapons' manuals, officials said. To be considered``combat ready,'' 85 percent of a guard unit must be trained in itsspecialty areas on the high-tech weaponry.   The South Carolina Army National Guard is getting the advancedweaponry because it has been ranked as the country's top outfit insix of the past nine years, said Capt. Jim Carter, Guard educationalservices coordinator.   South Carolina's HAWK missile brigade will be activated inOctober. The Guard has 60 Abrams tanks and 20 helicopters.</TEXT></DOC>
