The newcomers, members of the Democratic Progressive Party, hold just 13 seats in the 319-member Legislative Yuan, but exert a disruptive force that far exceeds their numerical strength. So far, more than a dozen microphones have been damaged as lawmakers fought to use them. The chairman's table in one of the conference rooms had to be raised as a preventive measure after an opposition legislator jumped on it to grab the mike.    The leaper was 33-year-old Chu Kao-cheng. Dubbed the Rambo of Taiwan politics, Mr. Chu has been known to spit and shout expletives at his wooden-faced elderly opponents. In one of his milder attacks, he said: &quot;The health of most of our aging legislators is failing. Why don't you all go home and rest. You're making the place weary and dreary.&quot;    For all the opposition's bravado, though, it is discovering that it really can't change the landscape of power in Taiwan. It might ruffle a few feathers from time to time, but it can't wish away the fundamental political fact that this island nation is still being ruled as firmly as ever -- if more genteelly than in past years -- by the Nationalists who fled mainland China when the Communists took over in 1949.    Since that defeat, the Nationalist Party, or Kuomintang, has used the threat of communism to justify its grip on the army, legislature and many civic organizations. Today, despite its pledges to introduce democratic reforms, its continuing determination to dominate assures that the transition to true democracy will be slow and painful.    &quot;The KMT's idea of a relationship with the opposition is one of granddaddy and grandson,&quot; complains one university professor.    On Monday, the legislature unanimously approved the cabinet's proposal to lift martial law, clearing the last hurdle for President Chiang Ching-kuo to make the historic announcement as early as next week. Then, the nine-month-old Democratic Progressive Party can be formally legalized. Civilians no longer will be tried in military courts and the government will replace the military as censors for publications. The government has even released several well-known political prisoners in recent months, presumably in anticipation of the event.    But Hu Fu, a law professor at National Taiwan University in Taipei, says the KMT is only giving up &quot;symbolic power.&quot; The real test for democracy, analysts say, is whether the ruling party is willing to dismantle the web of vested interests and business privileges that come with almost 40 years of single-party rule.    With the Nationalists outnumbering Democratic Progressive legislators 20-to-1, it is nearly impossible for the opposition to shape policy. &quot;I've tried reasoning with them -- it doesn't work,&quot; says the bespectacled Mr. Chu, who has a doctorate in philosophy from a European university.    What the opposition can do is raise its voice and draw attention to its cause. Sometimes, the strategy pays off. In May, the ruling party agreed for the first time to a reduced military budget, although the cut of 30 million New Taiwan dollars ($968,000) barely nibbles at the 198 billion-dollar total.    &quot;It's a political victory for us,&quot; says Kang Ning-hsiang, a Democratic Progressive legislator and veteran opposition leader.    Yet, even such small victories have persuaded some Kuomintang hard-liners to push for harsher crackdowns on illegal demonstrations sponsored by the opposition. &quot;We can't be seen to be losing the ability to maintain law and order, not when the country is about to lift martial law,&quot; says one senior official.    As long as concern for security haunts the Nationalists, Taiwan's road to democracy will be rugged, analysts say. The current makeup of the legislature exemplifies the problem. Only a fifth of the 320 seats represent Taiwan constituencies and may be contested in an election. The remaining seats are held for life by aging Kuomintang representatives who were elected by mainland constituencies in 1947.    As these ailing legislators die off, the opposition argues that their seats should be thrown open for election. That way, proponents of change say, the parliament will more accurately represent the native Taiwanese, who make up 85% of the population of 19 million.    Once again, Nationalist officials cite national security to explain why they oppose sharing power. &quot;Some of us are concerned that if the {Democratic Progressive Party} controls the majority seats, they will slash the national defense budget,&quot; says Liang Su-yung, a veteran Nationalist legislator. &quot;If we let down our guard, the Communists will come and Taiwan will be lost.&quot;    Thus, whatever democratic reforms come, analysts believe the format for nominations and elections will still assure the Nationalists of a majority.    Over the years, the ruling party has established a network of influence over the armed forces, however much the military is meant to stand outside politics. The opposition charges that it uses the army to promote its strict conservative line. &quot;Many years of brainwashing have succeeded in inhibiting the politically timid from coming out in the open to support the opposition,&quot; says Daniel Huang, a Democratic Progressive Party member.    But Ma Ying-jeou, deputy secretary-general of the Kuomintang Central Committee, counters that the army is taught to be loyal to the country rather than to the party.    ---               FACTS ABOUT TAIWAN    Population                     19 million    Armed forces                   424,000    GNP per capita                 $3,750    Foreign exchange reserves      $55.9 billion    Current account surplus        $16.1 billion    Note: Figures are for 1986    Source: Vickers da Costa; Pentagon</TEXT></DOC>
