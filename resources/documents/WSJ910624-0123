Eyewitness IrvingKristol reports (&quot;The Conservatives Find a Leader,&quot; editorialpage, June 3) that a group of National Review conservativesmeeting in Bermuda just prior to the Memorial Day weekendconcluded that &quot;President Bush is now the leader of theconservative movement within the Republican Party.&quot; That'snot what I saw.   Mr. Kristol's own description of George Bush makes itunlikely the president could be the leader of any movement.Leadership -- as opposed to management -- requirescharacteristics that Mr. Kristol makes it plain Mr. Bush doesnot display. He says, for example, that Mr. Bush isconducting a foreign policy that blurs ideologicaldistinctions. Exactly. But how do people who blur ideologicaldistinctions become leaders of ideological movements?</LP><TEXT>   There was certainly recognition by the conservatives inBermuda that Mr. Bush is the president, the head of theRepublican Party and is not likely to be dislodged by anyconservative revolt -- and is married to a class-act namedBarbara and lives in a big White House in Washington(conservatives pride themselves on being realists). But allthat does not make a leader of a movement -- a preconditionof leadership being a willingness to go uphill against the&quot;Zeitgeist&quot; (Bush &quot;contra mundum?&quot;).   Not that conservatives find Mr. Bush without courage oreffect: He fought for a capital-gains tax cut, he vetoed thecivil-rights quota bill, and he has selected excellentjudges. But to be the leader of the movement requires someability to teach and a willingness to sacrifice -- or besacrificed (William Buckley, Barry Goldwater, Ronald Reagan).For all the good qualities Mr. Bush may have, and any kindthoughts the Bermuda conservatives may have about him, Idoubt a single conservative there thought Mr. Bush wouldrather be right than be president.   The discussions I heard in Bermuda centered precisely onhow to raise up spokesmen to present (teach) the ferventlyheld conservative beliefs, and the programs based on them,and most especially programs aimed at helping the poor. Noone saw Mr. Bush as filling that role.   Daniel Olliver   Washington</TEXT></DOC>
