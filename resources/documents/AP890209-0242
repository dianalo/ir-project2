The program, Insults, combines and re-combines about 400 choicewords to produce PG-rated phrases like: ``You revolting box of freshbug parts,'' and, ``You skaggy bucket of infested parrot droppings.''   Dale McKinnon, the author, said Thursday he had upgraded Insultsseveral times since its publication in 1983 and won the MaledictaSeal of Approval with the current release, which was completed lastmonth.   ```Insults' is a fountain of millions of high-quality insults,''Dr. Reinhold Aman, president of the International Maledicta Societyof Waukesha, Wis., said in a statement endorsing the program.   Insults, which is only for IBM and IBM-compatible personalcomputers, is available free on computer bulletin boards and from PCclubs. McKinnon said he charges $5 for handling if people order itthrough his Salt Lake City computer consulting service, ModernAdvisory Institute.</TEXT></DOC>
