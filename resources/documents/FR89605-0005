Customers then have the opportunityto purchase stock that are tested ``clean'' of certain diseases, or thatare produced under disease-prevention requirements.The Plan currently consists of a variety of programs to prevent and controlegg-transmitted, hatchery-disseminated poultry diseases. Participationin all Plan programs is voluntary. However, flocks, hatcheries, and dealersmust qualify as ``U.S. Pullorum-Typhoid Clean'' before participating inany other Plan program.The regulations for this voluntary program are contained in 9 CFR Parts145 and 147 (referred to below as ``the regulations''). These provisionsare amended from time to time to incorporate new scientific informationand technologies within the Plan.We published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on January 6, 1989 (54 FR 418-427, Docket No.86-110), a proposal to amend the regulations by making the following changes:1. Establish a new ``U.S. Sanitation Monitored, Turkeys'' program and emblemfor turkey flocks and products.2. Require annual examination, by State Inspectors, of all records pertainingto flocks maintained primarily for production of hatching eggs. 3. Lower the minimum age at which turkeys can be blood tested.4. Change certain procedures for blood testing flocks and individual birdsfor pullorum-typhoid.5. Expand and improve the sanitation and flock management requirementsof the ``U.S. Sanitation Monitored'' program for egg-type chicken breedingflocks.6. Authorize egg yolk testing as an alternative method of monitoring certainmultiplier breeding flocks classified as ``U.S. M. Gallisepticum Clean.''7. Expand procedures used to determine if a flock is infected with theMycoplasma organism for which it was tested.8. Disclaim liability for failure, on the part of users, to adhere to OccupationalSafety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards for formaldehyde fumigation.Our proposed amendments were consistent with recommendations approved bythe voting delegates to the June 1986 and 1988 meetings of the BiennialNational Plan Conferences. Participants at these meetings represented flockowners,breeders, hatcherymen, and Official State Agencies from all cooperatingstates.<ITAG tagnum="84">Comments</ITAG>Our proposal invited the submission of written comments, which were requiredto be received or postmarked by February 6, 1989. We subsequently publishedanother document in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on March 8, 1989 (54 FR 9842, Docket No. 89-023)re-opening and extending the comment period until April 7, 1989. We receivedeleven comments before the deadline. No commenter opposed the proposedrule, although three commenters suggested relatively minor changes to therule, discussed below.Section 145.23(d)_U.S. Sanitation Monitored Program QualificationsOne commenter suggested that proposed andSection; 145.23(d)(1)(vi) be changedfrom requiring pullorum-typhoid antigen testing of 300 birds from eachflock, to requiring testing of 300 birds from primary breeding flocks and150 birds from multiplier flocks. The commenter suggested this sample sizebecause it would be consistent with the present requirements for testingflocks for the ``U.S. <T3>M. Gallisepticum </T3>Clean'' program (andSection; 145.23(c)) and the``U.S. <T3>M. Synoviae </T3>Clean'' program (andSection; 145.23(e)).We are not making any change in response to this comment. The sample sizeof 300 birds was designed to ensure a 95 percent probability of detectingflocks infected with Salmonellosis at an incidence of 1 percent. Becausethe best presently available research indicates that Salmonellosis canoccur in flocks at an incidence as low as 1 percent, while the incidenceof <T3>Mycoplasma gallisepticum </T3>and <T3>M. synoviae </T3>in flocks infected with these organisms is usuallymuch higher, we believe it is important to test for Salmonellosis at arate of 300 birds per flock. If later experience in flock testing showsthat the incidence of Salmonellosis is normally greater than 1 percent,we will consider reducing the 300 bird sample size.One commenter noted, regarding the discussion in the Background sectionof the proposed rule concerning isolation of <T3>S. enteritidis </T3>from environmental samples, that environmentalcontamination can also result from contaminated feed containing incompletelypasteurized animal protein products either prior to mixing or in completefeed. We agree with this comment. Since the comment does not relate tothe rulemaking language of the proposal, no change to the rule is beingmade.One commenter requested that <T3>S. enteritidis </T3>antigen be approved for use in the tests requiredby andSection; 145.23(d)(1)(vi). We proposed to require use of pullorum-typhoidantigen, which is as effective as <T3>S. enteritidis </T3>antigen in detecting infected birds, and whichis available in a form allowing rapid whole blood plate tests. Since thetests are used only as a screening device to identify birds to necropsy,a simple and rapid test is desirable. Because no available <T3>S. enteritidis </T3>antigen test currently meets these criteria, nochange is being made in response to this comment.Pelletized Feed Manufacturing StandardsOne commenter addressed the standards for pelletized feed fed to flocks,contained in andSection;andSection; 145.23(d)(1)(ii)(A) and 145.43(f)(3)(i).These proposed sections contain cooking time, temperature, and pressurestandards designed to destroy any <T3>Salmonella </T3>present during the feed pellet manufacturing process.The commenter suggested that a requirement be added to require that duringmanufacture, the feed mix must contain a minimum moisture content of 14.5percent. The commenter stated that this moisture content is necessary toensure that all <T3>Salmonella </T3>present are destroyed by the temperature, pressure,and cooking time standards contained in these sections.We agree that maintaining a 14.5 percent moisture content during the pelletizedfeed manufacturing process is advisable to ensure destruction of <T3>Salmonella</T3>, and are changing these sections accordingly.MiscellaneousSeveral commenters made suggestions that were outside the scope of theproposed rule, some of which addressed other areas of the National PoultryImprovement Plan. These suggestions are appropriate for discussion at thenext Biennial National Plan Conference meeting in 1990.We have replaced the term ``birth'' with the more accurate term ``hatching''at several places in the rule. We have also made minor editorial changesand corrections to the proposed rule.Based on the rationale set forth in the proposal and in this document,we are adopting the proposal, with the changes discussed in this document,as a final rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291 and Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>We are issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12291, andwe have determined that it is not a ``major rule.'' Based on informationcompiled by the Department, we have determined that this rule will havean effect on the economy of less than $100 million; will not cause a majorincrease in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal,state, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; and will notcause a significant adverse effect on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.The Plan is a cooperative Federal-state program. Participation is voluntary.Changes to provisions of this program are based on recommendations of theBiennial National Plan Conference, which included representatives of memberstates, hatcheries, dealers, flock owners, and breeders. Plan participantsrequested that we make amendments to the regulations to incorporate newtechnology and information within the Plan.The amendments made in this document should not cause significant changesin the cost of producing or buying poultry and poultry products, or inthe amount of poultry and poultry products marketed because:1. The annual examination of all records pertaining to flocks maintainedprimarily for production of hatching eggs should enable Official StateAgencies to identify more of the flocks that have incurred a possible diseaseexposure. This should increase the effectiveness of the annual on-siteinspection program, but will neither increase nor decrease the number ofinspections conducted.2. Changing the minimum age for blood testing turkeys will permit testingone month earlier than under current rules, but will neither increase nordecrease the number of birds tested annually.3. Amendments to certain of the Plan's testing and monitoring proceduresincorporate new technology and research findings. These changes shouldincrease effectiveness and permit use of alternative tests and monitoringprocedures for diseases prevented and controlled by Plan programs.4. Amendments to the provisions of the ``U.S. Sanitation Monitored, Turkeys''program will result in a slight increase in producer costs for additionaltesting. However, these same amendments should result in a slight reductionin the egg and chick mortality for participating flocks. It is difficultto project the degree to which these new producer costs and savings willbe offset, because the regulations allow flock owners to choose among testingand feed alternatives. Nevertheless, we are certain that net costs or savingsresulting from the changes will be significant, in terms of overall productioncosts, and will not affect the wholesale or retail cost of poultry or poultryproducts.5. Cost-benefits to producers who decide to participate in the new ``U.S.Sanitation Monitored, Turkeys'' program will also roughly balance out.Producers will incur a small additional cost for required sanitation measures(although many producers are already engaging in some or all of these sanitationpractices). The primary purpose of these measures is to reduce the incidenceof Salmonella in the flock, but reduced Salmonella levels should, in turn,result in a slight increase in the number of surviving eggs and poults.The experience of the turkey industry in Minnesota_where a ``U.S. SanitationMonitored, Turkeys'' program has been underway for seven years_is thatprofits from the sale of the additional eggs and poults roughly equalsthe cost of the additional sanitation measures.Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant HealthInspection Service has determined that this rule will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. <ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>This rule contains no information collection or recordkeeping requirementsunder the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>).<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12372</ITAG>These programs/activities under 9 CFR Parts 145 and 147 are listed in theCatalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.025 and are subjectto Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultationwith state and local officials.
