Box 7900, MountainView, CA 94039-7900; (415) 961-4400.andM;Version: 1.01.andM;Requires: Hard-disk drive or two 800K drives; System 6.0.2 or later.andM;Application Size: 130K.andM;Compatibility: Mac Plus or later.andM;On-screen jaggies are the bane of desktop publishers, especially for text inlarge point sizes; most PostScript-typeface suppliers provide nothing largerthan a 24-point screen font.andP;  The problem is more than cosmetic: Realisticscreen fonts are helpful for accurate positioning in graphic design, andthey're essential for quickly generating kerning pairs with any of thekerning programs available for the Mac.andP;  Adobe's eagerly awaited fontutility, ATM (Adobe Type Manager), goes a long way toward solving thejagged-text problem.andM;WHAT IT ISandM;Adobe Type Manager is a combination INIT and cdev that gives you a moreaccurate rendition of Adobe (Type 1) fonts at larger point sizes -- bothon-screen and on ImageWriter output.andP;  You simply drag ATM and an auxiliaryfile into your System Folder and restart the computer.andP;  ATM gobbles up about200K of RAM (which can spell trouble for those limited to 1 megabyte).andM;For optimal use, you need a hard disk, because you must also place printerfonts (the kind you use with downloadable Adobe fonts such as Garamond) intoyour System Folder for any of the standard 35 LaserWriter Plus fonts that youintend to use.andP;  The basic package includes the printer fonts for Times,Helvetica, Courier, and Symbol.andP;  (The other LaserWriter Plus fonts areavailable for $198.)andP;  Once installed, ATM remains transparent to the user.andO;If you need to access it, you do so through the Control Panel.andM;HOW IT WORKSandM;Whenever you type on the Mac, it grabs a bit-mapped image of a font'scharacters from the familiar suitcase files installed in your System.andP;  If youhave only 10- and 12-point bit maps of Times, the Mac has to scale thesmaller point sizes when you type a 48-point headline.andP;  The result is thedreaded jaggies that mar curved lines.andM;ATM avoids the problem, when Adobe fonts are used, by interrupting the usualfont calls and generating a bit map on the fly from the printer-font files.andO;The figure at left offers a persuasive on-screen comparison of the twoapproaches (with and without ATM).andM;Adobe's program promises substantial benefits to ImageWriter owners as well-- and Adobe's ads are strongly targeting this market -- since they can nowprint out Adobe fonts in exceptional quality -- even at large point sizes(see the figure below).andM;But even Mac users who output to PostScript printers can find a lot in ATM tosalivate over.andP;  Manipulating text is easier when the characters' on-screenappearance more closely parallels the printed output.andP;  And if you work withpaint programs such as MacPaint, in which everything is bit-mapped even whenyou're dealing with PostScript fonts, you'll find your text, expecially inlarge point sizes, drastically improved.andM;Then, of course, there's the question of how ATM doesn't work.andP;  It doesn'twork with any fonts created by Altsys' Fontographer -- the so-called Type 3fonts.andP;  Installing ATM on your Mac causes peculiar behavior in some programs.andO;For example, with ATM installed, LaserPaint Color II's text tools just giveup the ghost.andP;  And the right sides of letters are clipped off in CompuServeNavigator's main on-line window.andM;Solutions to many of these application-specific problems should be availablesoon, though.andP;  Adobe is working with many third-party developers to help themrelease new ATM-compatible versions of their programs.andM;The ATM manual says you need to keep only the Roman bit-mapped fontsinstalled in your System.andP;  ATM generates styles on-screen without the bold oritalic bit maps installed, but you still need bold and italic printer fonts.andO;(ATM includes bold, italic, and bold-italic outline fonts for Times,Helvetica, and Courier.)andM;I found ATM's rendering of italics lacking in the 10- and 12-point sizes.andO;Some letters seemed appreciably larger than others within the same word.andO;These on-screen anomalies disappear when you use type larger than 12-point.andM;Although these were the only problems I encountered after nearly a month ofdaily use, discussions on CompuServe indicate that incompatibilities betweenATM and other programs are more common than my experience indicates.andO;Complaints about ATM -- and especially about its advertised ability todramatically boost the quality of ImageWriter output -- are widespread.andP;  Inmy ImageWriter tests, using Word 4.0 and MacWrite II (version 1.1), I raninto several inconsistencies, including dropped characters, arbitrary wordwrap and margin changes, and generally poorer quality with the PreserveCharacter Shape option instead of the Preserve Line Spacing option.andP;  Mac Plusand SE users also experience significantly slower performance overall.andP;  Yourbest bet is to try ATM with the applications and hardware configurations youuse most often before you buy it.andP;  ATM is good, but it's not a panacea foryour printer problems.andM;Warts notwithstanding, this product is a welcome addition to the DTP toolset.andP;  It opens up the Adobe type collection -- one of the largest sources ofexquisitely designed PostScript type in the world -- to ImageWriter users.andO;And it brings a degree of accuracy to typographical graphic design that istruly refreshing.andP;  ATM's first version is a good start, but it could stilluse improvement.andP;  Future versions should be even better.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
