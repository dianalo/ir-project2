Here come the corporate buyers.    After years of being overshadowed by flashy raiders in billion-dollar battles, U.S. companies are staging a comeback on the takeover scene.    Corporations with strong balance sheets and plenty of cash aren't fazed by either the undermining of the junk-bond market or the possibility of a recession. With some target companies' stock prices near their lows of recent years, bargain-hunting corporations aren't hesitating to launch hostile bids. And takeover professionals say corporate interest is apparent in practically every industry, ranging from retailing to oil and gas, from consumer products to metals.    In one of the biggest non-oil acquisitions on record, Eastman Kodak Co. and Sterling Drug Inc. announced on Friday a merger agreement involving $5.1 billion in cash.    Even before that, the first three weeks of 1988 had seen a surge of corporate takeover bids, many of them hostile. Neoax Inc. is seeking IU International Corp. for $480 million. Prime Computer Inc. has gone after Computervision Inc. in a $435 million takeover fight. Emhart Corp. has launched a $598 million hostile bid for Stanadyne Inc.    And last week's move by American Brands Inc. to attempt a takeover of a potentially hostile suitor, E-II Holdings Inc., may indicate that the new corporate bids may yield some drama. The diversified tobacco concern's bid for E-II resurrects one of the most controversial of takeover tactics, the so-called Pac Man defense, which hadn't been used in a major takeover battle since the Martin Marietta-Allied-Bendix battle of 1982.    &quot;Corporate takeovers are back,&quot; says Joseph Flom, a top takeover lawyer with Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher andamp; Flom in New York. &quot;Before the (stock-market) crash, companies were staying out of the market because they didn't want to compete at those crazy prices. Now, they can buy at reasonable rates.&quot;    Hamilton James, the head of mergers and acquisitions at Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Corp., says the surge in corporate takeovers &quot;is being driven by cheaper stocks more than anything else.&quot; Moreover, while raiders such as Messrs. Jacobs and Edelman &quot;typically run stock portfolios and were hit hard in the crash, corporate buyers don't tend to park their money in stock portfolios and weren't hurt as much. Their buying power wasn't impacted,&quot; Mr. James says.    The hunters aren't limited to U.S. companies. The widely anticipated wave of foreign takeovers is also beginning to break on U.S. shores, partly because the weak dollar has turned the U.S. into a bargain basement for foreigners. The two largest such takeover plays are F. Hoffmann-La Roche andamp; Co.'s $4.62 billion hostile tender offer for Sterling Drug -- an offer that apparently was outgunned by the Kodak agreement Friday -- and B.A.T Industries PLC's $4.2 billion proposal for Farmers Group Inc. Overseas, Italian financier Carlo De Benedetti has launched a hostile bid for Belgium's largest company, Societe Generale de Belgique.    A number of factors besides low stock prices have conspired to encourage U.S. corporate executives to attempt takeovers. Gone are the potentially restrictive tax proposals that helped spark the stock-market crash; in their place are federal regulations that hobble noncorporate buyers and tax greenmailers. And with the economy so far apparently riding out the crash, U.S. companies seem less worried about the threat of an imminent recession that might have kept them from gambling heavily on takeovers.    &quot;It's an absolutely golden financial opportunity&quot; for corporate buyers, says Eric Gleacher, who heads mergers and acquisitions at Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., which is representing Sterling Drug and American Brands in two prominent battles. &quot;Two months ago, you had a shock effect,&quot; with prospective corporate buyers fearful of committing large sums, he adds. &quot;It's worn off. People aren't as pessimistic as they once were.&quot;    Few takeover professionals, however, are predicting a return to the merger mania of the past four years. The market for high-yield &quot;junk&quot; bonds, the principal source for takeover financing in recent years, remains in disarray and may have suffered permanent damage from Black Monday. And the use of the interim financing technique known as &quot;bridge loans&quot; -- in which investment banks provide temporary financing for takeovers -- remains limited because Wall Street firms have turned more cautious about lending.    But for companies with cash, bargains abound. In addition, commercial banks have often stepped into the breach created by the absence of glitzier financing techniques, especially on small to medium-sized acquisitions. And a few smaller deals, such as Franklin Computer Corp.'s acquisition of a Florida computer maker, have been done for stock.    But because many of the mega-deals of recent years were financed with junk bonds, some takeover professionals expect fewer mammoth acquisitions this year.    &quot;Most of the corporate takeovers we're seeing right now aren't home runs,&quot; Donaldson Lufkin's Mr. James says. &quot;These are singles and doubles.&quot;    Perhaps typical is a $96.8 million offer by Sonny DeCesaris andamp; Sons Development Group for Washington Homes Inc. Black Monday killed the financing for an earlier bid by the DeCesaris group, which held an 8.5% stake in the Maryland homebuilder. But the suitor's dismay quickly turned to enthusiasm when Washington Homes' stock plummeted and, recently, financing again became available. Last week, DeCesaris, armed with proposals for bank and subordinated-debt financing, came back with a bid 17% under its pre-crash offer.    &quot;Directly after the crash, we kind of just wanted to wait on the sidelines,&quot; says Geaton DeCesaris Jr., general partner of the DeCesaris group. &quot;But now, (lenders) are coming back to the plate, saying they want to do deals again. It's a good time for us to move.&quot;    The difficult financing environment may force suitors for some large companies to resort to proxy fights to gain control. Just last week, Henley Group Inc. signaled its intent to begin such a battle for Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp. after it couldn't obtain suitable financing for a takeover, either through junk bonds or through money-center banks.    Takeover professionals suggest that a similar proxy fight could emerge for control of Chicago-based USG Corp., in which Texas oil men Cyril Wagner and Jack Brown hold a 9.9% stake but also haven't been able to obtain adequate financing for a takeover. A spokesman for the Texans declined comment on their intentions.    &quot;You're going to see so many proxy fights it will make your head spin,&quot; says Don Carter of the Carter Organization, a leading proxy solicitor that is representing Henley Group. Mr. Carter, who also represents Carl Icahn and Sterling Drug in pending corporate clashes, says he expects so much proxy business that he has canceled a spring vacation to the Bahamas.    Many of the merger overtures are being cold-shouldered, and the upshot has been a surge of hostile bids. More may be on the way: Likely targets include Lorimar Telepictures Corp., rumored to be in investor Marvin Davis's sights, and Gillette Co., in which New York's Conniston Partners is believed to have a stake.    &quot;Buyers have been quick to adjust to lower stock prices; sellers haven't,&quot; says Stephen M. Waters, co-head of mergers and acquisitions at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. Targets, he says, &quot;simply don't want to see themselves bought for a low price. It's hard for them to adjust to the fact that values will never again be what they were three months ago.&quot;    Also aiding corporate buyers may be a lack of competition from noncorporate rivals. Raiders and leveraged-buy-out firms have largely lain dormant since Black Monday, hurt by the comatose junk-bond market and tougher tax laws, among other things.    Congress recently delivered a major blow to many takeover artists. It eliminated the so-called mirror-subsidiary technique, which enabled an acquirer to get appreciated assets out of a target company without incurring corporate-level taxes. This, combined with higher tax liabilities for corporate divestitures, cuts deeply into the profits of noncorporate buyers, especially leveraged-buy-out firms breaking up an acquired company.    &quot;For the corporate buyer, the elimination of mirrors has leveled the playing field with the noncorporate buyer, so that (the noncorporate buyer)doesn't have an unusual advantage to sell off pieces,&quot; Skadden Arps's Mr. Flom says. &quot;A corporate buyer who wants to just buy the company and hold on to the pieces now can compete on even ground.&quot;    An exception to that rule was investor Paul Bilzerian's $1.06 billion takeover of Singer Co. Mr. Bilzerian and his financial adviser, Shearson Lehman Brothers, plan to split up and sell Singer's different businesses. But Mr. Bilzerian initiated his deal before the mirror technique was eliminated. Moreover, his agonizing weeks-long search to finance the takeover could presage the financing difficulties to be faced by many takeover players who once relied on junk bonds.    ---                   Corporate Takeover Bids      SUITOR            TARGET              VALUE      Eastman Kodak     Sterling Drug       $5.1 billion      B.A.T Industries  Farmers Group       $4.2 billion      American Brands   E-II Holdings       $875 million      Emhard            Stanadyne           $598 million      Neoax             IU International    $480 million      Prime Computer    Computervision      $435 million</TEXT></DOC>
