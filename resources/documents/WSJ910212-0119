Dmitri Volkogonov, aprogressive historian, referring to one of the bloodiestyears of Stalin's rule. Others talk gloomily about a returnto Brezhnev-era oppression.</LP><TEXT>   From their speeches and behaviour so far, it is clear thatmany of those now in power do want to turn back the clock.But the year they have in mind is more like 1987 than 1937.   They harken back to a time when Mr. Gorbachev's policiesof perestroika and glasnost had been unleashed, but had yetto shake the foundations of the old order. The CommunistParty still ran the nation, but there were some limitedexperiments with democracy, such as elections with more thanone candidate. The press was starting to criticize, butcautiously. A search was on for ways to overhaul the economy,but nobody was openly advocating capitalism.   The new Kremlin leaders have yet to give a clear outlineof their agenda. Most have shied away from the media, andwhat little they have said may be at odds with their trueintentions.   Nonetheless, a nostalgia for the early years of Mr.Gorbachev's rule runs through their comments, both in privateconversations and in interviews published in the Sovietpress. Two main points recur: the desire to maintainsocialism as the basis of the social system, and the need torestore order.   &quot;We are against any dictatorship,&quot; Gennady Yanayev, Mr.Gorbachev's surprise choice for vice president, told a Sovietinterviewer recently. &quot;We are seeking to restore order to beable to accelerate the democratic process.&quot;   Boris Pugo, a long-time KGB official who recently wasappointed interior minister, is more forthright. &quot;A return toold methods is not possible,&quot; he says.   Messrs. Yanayev, Pugo and several of their colleaguesargue that perestroika as it was initially conceived by Mr.Gorbachev and the Communist Party has gone awry. If only thetwo conditions of socialism and order can be satisfied, thenperestroika can be put back on the rails.   When describing his goals, Ivan Polozkov, head of theRussian Communist Party, even talks about the need to restore&quot;socialist perestroika.&quot;   Appropriately, it was Yegor Ligachev who expressed thisnostalgia most succinctly. Until his unceremonious retirementlast July, Mr. Ligachev, now a favorite of hard-liners,worked closely with Mr. Gorbachev in perestroika's earlyyears.   In an interview with the Sovetskaya Rossiya daily lastweek, Mr. Ligachev referred to Mr. Gorbachev's pre-1988 ruleas &quot;years in which the country was on the ascendant. It was atime of spiritual uplift in society. People lived withenthusiasm, with real hopes for improvement. The economy wasclimbing, the volumes of production and productivity wererising.&quot;   Just how the new leadership hopes to return to thepre-1988 days remains uncertain. Mr. Gorbachev has backedaway from the use of military force following theinternational uproar over his violent crackdown in theBaltics.   The following is a sector by sector account of theemerging agenda of the new hard-line leadership, as gleanedfrom their public and private statements.                                                                                                          -- NATIONALISM. All top Kremlin officials agree that thishas gone too far. At the same time, many seem to accept theneed for some decentralization of power. &quot;The process ofnational rebirth is normal and it should happen,&quot; says asenior interior ministry official. What has gone wrong,according to this thinking, is that nationalism has becomemixed with strong anti-Communist sentiment that threatens todestroy the U.S.S.R. as a united state. &quot;It's just a minoritywho want to live in a bourgeois republic,&quot; complains theinterior ministry official, speaking on the condition that henot be identified.                                                                                                          -- DEMOCRACY. Elections in 1989 and 1990 pushed rulingCommunists out of office in many large cities, such asMoscow, Leningrad and Sverdlovsk. But the Communist Party haswatched patiently as these new governments have bogged downin the difficulties of providing food and housing. Asdisgruntlement has risen, the Communists have seized theirchance to press for stronger powers for the center. &quot;Someconfuse democracy with mob rule,&quot; Mr. Yanayev says. &quot;Thiscountry is in bad need of order and we must ensure this orderif we want people to regain confidence in their future.&quot;                                                                                                          -- ECONOMY. By all accounts, attempts at liberalizationover the past five years have been a dismal failure.Shortages of most goods have reached a crisis point, themoney supply is out of control and factories have beenignoring the orders of central planners.   Under Valentin Pavlov, the new prime minister, the Kremlinis now actively trying to reverse these trends. It hasalready moved to confiscate some of the cash in circulationand is expected in the near future to order price rises onmost goods. This is designed to reduce the enormous budgetdeficit and is in keeping with a program of action worked outby central planners last spring that was rejected at the timeby Mr. Gorbachev. Officials promise that the public willfirst receive some compensation for the price increases.   At the same time, the KGB and industry officials aredetermined to crack down on the burgeoning black market,intimidate private entrepreneurs and restore parts of thecentral-planning structure. The government recently heldmeetings to discuss new centralized programs for several keyindustries, including oil, gas, coal, chemicals and timber.As part of these programs, the military-industrial complex isbeing asked to provide new machinery. But, in an unfavorablesign for foreign investors, there has been no mention of anyrole for Western companies.   Mr. Pavlov and others describe the plans as steps towardsa &quot;market economy.&quot; But some observers say the program ismore reminiscent of the early days of perestroika, when thegovernment sought to accelerate the pace of economic growththrough big centralized investments to its machineryindustry.                                                                                                          -- MEDIA. The Kremlin's new media-policy makers insistthat glasnost, the spirit of greater openness, isn't about tobe shut down. But, they say, parts of the media have becometools of anti-socialist activists and must be countered. &quot;Ishall do my best to ensure that the mass media don'tintensify the political confrontation in society,&quot; saysLeonid Kravchenko, the hard-liner who now heads nationaltelevision. The key word is &quot;objectivity.&quot; Censors havealready moved back to work at national TV, and a big fight istaking place in the government daily Izvestia after theKremlin tried to remove the popular deputy editor. He isstill in place after the newspaper's staff protested andcalled instead for the ouster of the more hard-line editor.                                                                                                          -- FOREIGN POLICY. Some hardliners such as Messrs.Ligachev and Polozkov grumble openly about Mr. Gorbachev'spolicies to date, especially the collapse of communism inEastern Europe and the reunification of Germany. But mostagree that there should be no return to the confrontationalpolicies of the Cold War-era, which could bankrupt thealready ailing economy. Nonetheless, relations with the U.S.,particularly over the war, appear headed for cooler days. Onenewspaper called the bombing of Iraq &quot;genocide.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
