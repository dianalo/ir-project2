Posts LossOf $4.5 Million for the Fourth Quarter---By Peter WaldmanStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 01/30/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> CVGTEARNINGS (ERN) </IN><TEXT>   Convergent Technologies Inc., still woozy from losing most of a large original-equipment manufacturing contract with American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., reported a narrower fourth-quarter loss.    The computer and software concern's $4.5 million loss, which compares with a loss of $6.3 million in the year-ago quarter, resulted from nonrecurring charges totaling $4.9 million. Without the charges, the company would have shown a small profit, which is what industry analysts had expected.    The fourth-quarter one-time charges include $2.9 million from the donation of several hundred computer systems to U.S. colleges and universities, $400,000 from the closing of the company's Japanese subsidiary, and $1.6 million from the consolidation of certain leased facilities.    Convergent's chairman and chief executive officer, Paul C. Ely, is &quot;taking the opportunity to clean house, or they would have done a little better than break even,&quot; said Richard Edwards, a computer industry analyst with Robertson, Coleman andamp; Stephens in San Francisco.    The Milpitas, Calif.-based company's fourth-quarter revenue fell 35% to $77.4 million from $118.8 million a year earlier.    Convergent is struggling to wean itself from its dwindling original-equipment relationship with ATandamp;T, whose UNIX-PC microcomputer, manufactured by Convergent, has flopped in the marketplace.    The company's shipments to ATandamp;T have declined from a peak of $48 million during the fourth-quarter of 1985, to $7 million in the quarter just ended, according to Stephen K. Smith, analyst with PaineWebber Group Inc. Mr. Smith expects Convergent's ATandamp;T shipments to be &quot;just a trickle&quot; in 1987.    Under Mr. Ely, who became chief executive in early 1985, Convergent has embarked on a new strategy to create what it calls a &quot;federation&quot; of software companies specializing in applications for small businesses.    Mr. Smith said Convergent's software activities, including subsidiaries serving auto dealerships, beverage distributorships and lumber yards, currently account for about a third of the company's revenue, with the remainder coming from Convergent's traditional original-equipment, or OEM, computer businesses.    &quot;The problem is their OEM business isn't profitable,&quot; said Mr. Smith. &quot;They need to do about $65 million in OEM to break even, and they only did $51 million last quarter.&quot;    On the upside, analysts say, Convergent may benefit in coming months from many users of some of its roughly 250,000 currently installed systems, who may trade up to the new, more powerful 80386 microprocessor made by Santa Clara, Calif.-based Intel Corp.    Unlike most other personal computers, Convergent's systems contain modules that allow users to upgrade their systems when new chips become available. &quot;To some extent, they have a captive market already out there,&quot; said Mr. Smith.    For the full year, the company had a loss of $32.8 million, compared with earnings of $13.2 million, or 30 cents a share, a year earlier. The company's 1986 revenue declined 33% to $305.8 million from $459.3 million last year.
