As long as you don't rock the boat, nobodycares.&quot;;   Bonner's job rating last year: highly effective.;   &quot;I read a lot,&quot;says Bonner's neighbor, Philip Ricobono, another sidelined $80,000-a-yearsenior Labor bureaucrat. Hearing himself, Ricobono adds, &quot;I hate to make itsound like that's the whole day.&quot; There are seven cigarette butts in theashtray on his table in the cafeteria by 9 a.m.;   Jules Balog, one cubicleaway, is hardly busier. &quot;Things went kinda quiet&quot; in 1985, says Balog. Now hespends most days reading and doing elaborate mathematic doodles on hiscomputer.;   &quot;You walk up and down the corridors. You drink coffee. You're onthe phone to your friends. You read the paper,&quot; says Vincent Finan, anotherdispirited Labor bureaucrat who recently retired from the same small office.;  &quot;Heartbreak Ridge,&quot; they call their row of cubicles. It's certainly catchierthan the sign on the door that reads:;   LABOR MANAGEMENT RELATIONS; ANDCOOPERATIVE PROGRAMS; Policy, Planning andamp; Research Staff; Office of IndustrialRelations; Analysis andamp; Information Services; Div. of Industrial RelationsAnalysis; This mouthful is not a boneyard or a turkey farm -- what bureaucratscall the irrelevant offices to which misfits are exiled. Rather, it is astagnated and demoralized backwater of the federal bureaucracy that has lostits mission and nobody cares. That problem is widespread, some expertsbelieve.;   &quot;Put it this way,&quot; says Charles L. Heatherly, a bureaucracyspecialist at the conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington. &quot;There arenow a number of agencies in Washington where the administration doesn't takethe mission seriously, the Congress doesn't take their oversight seriously,and the bureaucrats don't take their jobs seriously.&quot;;   Bonner, Balog andcompany don't say that. They say their office once was Labor's pipeline to theAFL-CIO. They say they trained scores of union leaders, particularly intransportation and the public sector. They say that, to the extent that anyonein the U.S. government is promoting Japanese-style co-operative relationshipsbetween labor and management, their bureau is doing it.;   But the residentsof &quot;Heartbreak Ridge&quot; -- five white males over 50, most of them die-hardtraditional unionists -- are not doing much.;   Too savvy and too certifiablycompetent to be fired, too cynical to be easily managed, they mostly hang inthere. They work some, unbidden, at their specialties. But they get noassignments. What chains them to their desks are high salaries and lucrativepensions near at hand.;   &quot;I was very angry for a while,&quot; says Bonner, 59, apublic sector unions specialist. &quot;Then my wife pointed out that all I'd lostwas my dignity and that really isn't worth anything in the bank anyway.&quot;;   SoBonner, like his idled colleagues, continues to kill time in a cubicle crampedwith the trappings of his GS-15 rank: a leather easy chair, a hatrack, aglass-fronted bookcase, a big wooden desk. The air vents hiss but the phonesrarely ring. Classical music plays faintly in the background.;   A changedmission;   He and his colleagues didn't come to Washington for this. They camein the '60s when the vision of a Great Society was a national aspiration. &quot;Foryears I felt I was doing the Lord's work,&quot; says Bonner. &quot;I was getting praisefrom the people I was helping, from my bosses.&quot;;   Then came Ronald Reagan. Hetraumatized Labor by slashing its budget and staff by 15 percent between 1981and 1983. His Labor appointees questioned whether America really needed aminimum wage. It was no time to be teaching unions how to bargain. &quot;We weredumped,&quot; says Bonner.;   Since then, four Labor secretaries have come andgone.;   Careerists say the short tenure of Labor's top policy-makers hascaused enervating turmoil for more than a decade.;   &quot;Uncertainty has became apart of the culture,&quot; explains Jerry Barnett, a former senior official inBonner's bureau who left last summer.;   Still, Bonner and the other residentsof &quot;Heartbreak Ridge&quot; believe a determined senior policy-maker could put themback in business. There are none in sight.;   They aren't laboring;   JohannaSchneider, Labor's official representative to the news media, looks puzzledwhen asked whether it's possible that some people at Labor aren't laboring.;  &quot;Employees are required to have a position description with very clear-cutelements and performance standards,&quot; she says. A &quot;very formal and useful&quot;evaluation procedure assures that the standards are met or bad actors dealtwith &quot;if the evaluators are being honest.&quot;;   In fact, says Bonner, in 21years at Labor he's never seen an evaluation concluding that an employee&quot;needs improvement.&quot;;   So, if &quot;Heartbreak Ridge,&quot; is to be fixed, it willhave to be fixed by Charles H. Spring, 48. His title is acting deputyundersecretary of the Bureau of Labor-Management Relations and CooperativePrograms: He oversees the 61 employees and $5.9 million budget that includesBonner and company.;   A provisional leader;   It's important that Spring isonly its provisional leader. He's a careerist who spent 25 years in thebureau, not a well-connected Republican, and he wants an $108,300-a-year jobthat requires nods from Labor's top Republican appointees and from the WhiteHouse.;   He's been waiting for them since May 1990, in an awkward posturethat left him unable to effectively resist as budget cutters pared down hisbureau's staff from 75.;   One result of the cuts, Spring says in aninterview, is that &quot;as resources shrink, there are fewer shelves to put peopleon. If you're lean, the one or two people who have retired on the job becomevery, very visible.&quot;;   &quot;We may not be as harsh on them as we ought to be,&quot; hesays of the habitues of &quot;Heartbreak Ridge.&quot; But all are performingsatisfactorily, Spring says, according to the performance evaluations that hesigns. And if some are not now doing $80,000 a year worth of work, civilservice scales say they're still due it, he adds.;   On a more upbeat note,Spring says he has proposed a possible new mission for his bureau. It turnsout to be one that speaks volumes about the federal bureaucracy.;   Labor'scivil war;   According to Spring, morale is low in Labor's army of unionizedsecretaries and clerks. On one hand, pay is meager, averaging $16,000 a year.On the other, their union has resisted firings so effectively that only fivein a bargaining unit of nearly 5,000 have been fired in the past five years.;  &quot;You do your own secretarial work,&quot; says a dismissive colleague in Bonner'soffice. &quot;Some are fine, but mostly you wouldn't want to ask the clericalpeople to do clerical work; that would make them feel inferior.&quot;;   It's evenworse in Labor's solicitor's office, according to Spring, where last year, aveteran secretary who rebuked a junior part-timer was answered with a hardright that broke her jaw.;   Associate solicitor Mark Machiz, realizingsomething had to be done, transferred the assailant to another office, where,five months later, she won a two-grade promotion and a permanent job. With thepromotion came a $3,890 raise -- hard fought, you might say.;   &quot;Maybe (thesenior secretary) deserved to have her jaw broken,&quot; muses Spring, who hasoffered the services of his bureau to reduce tensions in the solicitor'soffice.;   Plainly, the men on Heartbreak Ridge could use the work. (box); WHYLABOR HAS IT HARD; There are a number of reasons to believe that the problemsof one obscure office are not unique in the Labor Department:;   (check) Weaktop management: A cadre of 112 political appointees sets Labor's policies.According to a former White House personnel specialist who helped pick them,their quality reflects the department's low priority in recentadministrations.;   (check) Tired top careerists: Dispirited by frequenttransitions and 10 years of White House neglect but expecting more, many topexecutives had planned to retire this year. Then came an 18 to 25 percent payraise with terrific impact on pensions.;   &quot;Even the most cynical, exhaustedsenior bureaucrats will hang in there until 1994,&quot; says one manager.;  (check) Stagnation: Turnover is so low that the average employee's age rosefive years in the past 10.;   (check) Internal dissent: Tight budgets andminimal workforce expansion, coupled with low turnover, make competition forpromotions so intense that it approaches warfare.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Frank Greve  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911201  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  December  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1P  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  DRAWING  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  1,459  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday, December 1, 199100336144,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  0  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
