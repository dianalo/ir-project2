It isn't clear whether the retreat will end the showdownover Iraq's cooperation with U.N. resolutions requiring thenation to disclose and destroy its weapons of massdestruction. A group of more than 40 U.N. inspectors remainedin a standoff with Iraqi troops that are refusing to allowthe inspectors to remove from an Iraqi government buildingdocuments and film that the inspectors say show Iraq'snuclear weapons program.</LP><TEXT>   The standoff is the second in two days between U.N.inspectors trying to remove documents and Iraqi troops thatare stopping them. The U.N. Security Council gave theinspectors a strong statement of support and demanded thatIraq let them remove the documents.   In addition, U.S. military equipment began moving to SaudiArabia in preparation for possible military conflict withIraq. Six batteries of Patriot defense missiles, designed toprotect Saudi Arabia from Iraqi missile attacks, startedmoving to the Saudi kingdom from bases in Europe, Pentagonofficials said. Some 600 U.S. troops are moving with themissiles.   Arrival of the missiles was a precondition for any Saudiacquiescence in any new military move against Iraq, defenseofficials said. And, the officials said, the Pentagon isproceeding with plans to send fighter aircraft and otherequipment if orders to move come in the next few days.   Iraq disclosed its retreat in a letter to the SecurityCouncil in response to an ultimatum by France, which isleading the council this month. Jean-Bernard Merimee,France's representative at the U.N., said the Iraqi letteramounted to &quot;unconditional acceptance&quot; of the use of U.N.helicopters over Iraqi territory.   David Hannay, British ambassador to the U.N., said theSecurity Council planned to inform Iraq that it consideredits reply an unconditional acceptance and would schedule ahelicopter mission over Iraq soon.   Iraq has been refusing to let the helicopters fly unlessthe U.N. inspectors accepted a series of conditions,including bans on aerial photography and flights overBaghdad. The U.N. inspectors have been unwilling to operateunder such conditions, and the U.S., Britain and France havebeen preparing to begin armed military escorts of U.N.inspection helicopters unless Iraq dropped its conditions.   The Pentagon has been preparing to move large numbers ofaircraft to Saudi Arabia to carry out such escort missions,and possibly to launch attacks on Iraqi weapons sites ifPresident Saddam Hussein fails to cooperate with U.N.inspections. The U.N. is carrying out the inspections underSecurity Council resolutions that ended the Gulf War. Thoseresolutions require Iraq to disclose and destroy materialsstockpiled for the production and use of chemical, biologicaland nuclear weapons.   Military action is possible if Iraq challenges thehelicopter flights or if the confrontation over access todocuments continues. U.S. officials said they were treatingIraq's retreat on helicopter flights skeptically,particularly because Saddam Hussein has shown a pattern ofprobing for weaknesses in the international community'sstand.   Iraq's treatment of the inspection teams has strengthenedthe resolve of U.S. officials to draw a line concerningcompliance with U.N. resolutions. That attitude wasreinforced by Mr. Merimee, who is acting as Security Councilpresident. He declared that the council has thrown its fullsupport behind the inspectors and demanded that they beallowed to leave Iraqi government offices &quot;without anyconditions, and in particular that they can take with themall the documents they deem appropriate.&quot;   President Bush signaled his willingness to act, declaringthat the current showdown &quot;is very serious business and. . .Saddam Hussein ought not to miscalculate.&quot; He added: &quot;We donot want to see any more anguish inflicted on the Iraqipeople, but overriding that is the international community'sdetermination that these resolutions be fully complied with.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
