Robusta-type coffees are in abundance, but mild coffee exports had been restricted by quotas. This situation has been the principal price-supporting factor in the market recently.    However, once that prop was taken away for the 1988-89 ICO coffee year, prices declined sharply. The 1988-89 year began Saturday.    The December futures contract closed near its low of the day, down 5.64 cents a pound at $1.2629.    In London talks, the council set the overall 1988-89 global export quota at 58 million bags, the same as for last season, but with a two-million bag cut to take effect immediately because of current low prices. A bag weighs 132 pounds.    However, with the combination of various cuts and increases that are possible under the agreement, the overall quota can range from 53 million to 63 million bags.    The export shares of individual exporting countries was left unchanged from 1987-88, but a system of price differentials between &quot;other Mild&quot; coffees and Robustas was instituted to provide for increases in exports of &quot;other Mild&quot; coffees at the expense of Robustas.    Coffee-consuming countries had been distressed by the gradually escalating prices for mild coffees that are necessary in blends. These countries had been aggressively pushing for changing the form of allocation to allow more milds to come to market. Resistance to increases in mild coffee exports had been expected from Robusta producing countries, but accommodation apparently was made in talks that dragged on more than 24 hours after they had been expected to end.    The focal point of the new allocations was in the first quarter of the ICO coffee year, the October-December period that is critical for coffee roasters because they are buying supplies to prepare for the high-consumption winter months.    On Oct. 25, a one-million-bag restoration of quota can be triggered if the ICO &quot;indicator price&quot; -- a 15-day moving average -- is at or above $1.1440. Another one million bags could be restored 15 business days following the first increase if the indicator price is still at or above $1.1440.    If the premium between the indicator price of the &quot;other Mild&quot; is 25% higher than that of the Robustas at the time of the quota increase, only the Arabica coffees' quota will be reinstated.    If the premium of &quot;other Milds&quot; over Robustas is between 15% and 25%, the quota increase will be 850,000 bags of Arabica and 150,000 bags of Robustas. If the premium is less than 15%, the quotas will be allocated to exporters on a pro-rata basis.    After Jan. 1, there still could be increases and decreases in quotas, but on a more normal basis.    One analyst, Sandra Kaul of Shearson Lehman Hutton in New York, said her initial reaction to the agreement was neutral. &quot;The quota was set at a reasonable level and the figure itself doesn't inspire bullishness or bearishness,&quot; she said. &quot;The fact that the only quota cut allowed this quarter has already been made should tend to limit downside potential to $1.20 to $1.25 here in New York, as additional weakness won't be able to reduce allocations any further.&quot;    In other commodity markets yesterday:   COPPER: Futures prices were mixed with no new developments to push prices strongly in either direction. The spot October delivery rose 0.80 cent a pound to $1.1740, but was well short of its life-of-contract high of $1.1870. On the other hand, December copper, the most active contract, edged to another life-of-contract high of $1.1060, before falling back to end at $1.0915, down 0.45 cent. As a result of October's price rise and December's decline, the premium of the October contract over December increased by 1.25 cents to 8.25 cents. The September contract, when it expired last week, had a premium of more than 13 cents a pound over December. The nearmost position in futures tends to reflect conditions in the cash market, particularly when supplies are tight. London Metal Exchange warehouse copper inventories last week declined 7,600 tons to 10,725 tons, a drop that was at the upper end of dealers and analysts expectations.    PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices rose on modest demand that followed recent weakness. December delivery gold rose $3 an ounce to $402.20, while December silver rose 11 cents an ounce to $6.3350. January platinum rose $2.90 an ounce to $505.40. One analyst said a constructive development appeared to be that precious metals seemed unaffected by the easier trend in crude oil. The analyst described the buying as mainly bargain-hunting, and said that for the first time in a while, demand that appeared to be for Middle Eastern customers was evident from Switzerland. Adding to the support, he said, was some &quot;covering,&quot; or buying back, of short positions by computer-based funds.    GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Corn futures prices rose amid speculation that U.S. stockpiles are shrinking at a faster-than-expected clip. Some market analysts trimmed their projections of U.S. corn stockpiles for next year after Friday's Agriculture Department report. The report showed Sept. 1 supplies totaled 4.26 billion bushels, about 32 million bushels less than expected. Ralph Waldron, an analyst at Stotler andamp; Co., Chicago, said the report indicates that livestock consumption of corn hasn't slackened as much as expected in the wake of the drought-related rally in grain prices. A government program to sell discount-priced corn to ranchers might have prevented farmers from slaughtering some cattle this summer, he said. Another Agriculture Department report released after the close of trading Friday also indicated that U.S. farmers don't intend to shrink their hog herds as fast as had been earlier projected. While the report depressed the futures prices of live hogs and pork belly contracts yesterday at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, it helped support the price of soybean futures contracts for delivery through next July at the Chicago Board of Trade. According to some estimates, hogs consume about one-third of the soybean meal produced in the U.S. Wheat futures-prices rose amid renewed speculation that China is close to buying U.S. wheat. </TEXT></DOC>
