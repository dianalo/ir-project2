George Bush's campaign is fully orchestrated and carefully organized. Robert Dole's campaign is a one-man band that sometimes seems to lack any kind of discipline; yesterday it fired its two senior consultants.    It is an up-and-down contest that has moved South, where it appears to be the vice president's turn to win points on what is going to be a long road to the Republican presidential nomination.    Mr. Bush, flying in Air Force Two, accompanied by a press charter that costs reporters as much as $3,000 a day to board, takes no chances. The only gambling in this campaign is the blackjack game aboard the press charter.    Mr. Dole's campaign is spontaneous, undisciplined and frequently unpredictable. Just the other day, the two senior consultants, David Keene and Donald Devine, veteran conservative activists, were put aboard the campaign aircraft to put things in sharper focus. They were dismissed yesterday, after less than a week on the job.    Chaos is the Dole code word. Asked the other day how he schedules his campaign stops, Mr. Dole replies, &quot;Well, we all get into the airplane and say to the pilot, 'Go that way for a while.'&quot;    Until late this week, the Dole campaign plane -- everyone travels together -- was an old Boeing 737 leased from an outfit called Presidential Airways. The logo seems to have been pasted to the fuselage and the &quot;P&quot; in Presidential is missing. In the aftermath of his victories in the South Dakota primary and the Minnesota caucuses, Mr. Dole says the campaign might now be able to put the &quot;P&quot; back. &quot;We have a whole new case of bailing wire,&quot; he explains, in the kind of humorous line he simply can't resist.    But Mr. Dole still seethes over Mr. Bush's victory in the New Hampshire primary and blames his staff for not responding to Mr. Bush's last-minute TV blitz that labeled the senator as a big taxer and a straddler on foreign-policy issues. He still grumbles about his poll taker, Richard Wirthlin, predicting he'd win the primary. He says he has told his embattled staff -- especially campaign chairman Bill Brock -- &quot;that we aren't going to sit back and let them beat us over the head for three straight days again.&quot;    &quot;We're probably going to have a little offensive of our own&quot; here in South Carolina, a March 5 contest, and in most of the 20 Super Tuesday states on March 8, Mr. Dole promises. He hints his ads may attack Mr. Bush on the basis that the vice president &quot;is not reluctant to increase taxes if he gets spending down.&quot;    Sen. Dole doesn't expect to come out of Super Tuesday the winner, but he does hope to do well in parts of Florida and in states like Oklahoma, Missouri, Arkansas, Kentucky, Tennessee and North Carolina. His campaign, so far, has had an affinity with agriculture.    Mr. Bush, as the popular Ronald Reagan's vice president, is well-placed all across the South. Texas, as Mr. Dole points out, is &quot;one of Bush's home states.&quot; The Dole strategy is to survive Super Tuesday and move on to better times in states like Illinois and Wisconsin. Mr. Dole expects the campaign to shift back and forth several times before it is over. In the early stages at least, each time one of these two candidates becomes a clear front-runner, the voters seem to knock him down in the next contest, a situation similar to the bitter battle between Jimmy Carter and Ted Kennedy in 1980.    But getting anything functioning properly and on schedule seems almost beyond the Dole operation. Mr. Keene and Mr. Devine were put aboard the campaign plane to try to make the message more coherent. Until recently, Mr. Devine was the Reagan administration's personnel chief.    Mr. Keene, senior campaign aides felt, communicated well with traveling reporters. And, because he worked with Mr. Bush in 1980, he was credited with special insights into the enemy camp. Mr. Devine was considered to be particularly strong on details, a welcome asset. He was given much of the credit, for example, for the Minnesota victory. He was also a key factor in keeping open the lines of communication with Pat Robertson's camp.    But, in a power struggle, they lost out to Mr. Brock, the campaign chief. &quot;They are on their way home,&quot; is the way a campaign spokesperson in Washington put it. That leaves Mr. Brock surrounded by political specialists, almost all of whom are second-raters.    Mr. Devine says Mr. Brock was disturbed about a report by syndicated columnists Rowland Evans and Robert Novak that Mr. Devine and Mr. Keene were taking over the campaign. Mr. Devine said that yesterday morning, at a Jacksonville cafeteria, Mr. Brock told Mr. Keene: &quot;Listen. I'm cutting the string with you right here.&quot; When Mr. Devine joined the group, Mr. Brock told him, &quot;You're fired too, right now.&quot; According to Mr. Devine, Mr. Dole tried to calm down his campaign chief on the plane but Mr. Brock announced to reporters on board that the two men had been fired. &quot;Dole had to go along,&quot; says Mr. Devine. &quot;Brock had to show he was in charge.&quot;    Mr. Devine says he and Mr. Keene remain Dole loyalists. &quot;This is too bad. Our field people are pretty good. It's the headquarters that hurts.&quot;    Don Ringe, the campaign's TV consultant, has been succeeded by Murphy-Castellanos Advertising, a Virginia-based firm that produced the campaign video cassette, a Dole biography. Larry McCarthy, the man in charge, was still working on a new set of commercials late yesterday and no one could be sure just when they would go on the air. &quot;We'll do what we have to do,&quot; says Mr. McCarthy.    Mr. Dole's principal message, now as it was in the beginning, is that he is a legislative leader who gets things done. He argues again and again, post-New Hampshire, that he was the point man who put President Reagan's program put into law. &quot;Bush,&quot; he says, with open contempt, &quot;tried to get into the legislative-leadership business. He ran for the Senate twice -- and lost both times.&quot; Sen. Dole, unusually open and available to reporters, despises George Bush.    Mr. Bush is a less complicated human being -- not so clever as Mr. Dole and not nearly so funny. But he is, by training and job classification, an administrator. He sits atop a vast campaign apparatus in which everything is carefully calculated and calibrated. He likes things to go smoothly, according to plan.    &quot;What I've got to do as best I can in the last two weeks (before Super Tuesday) is get my position clear on these issues,&quot; he told reporters in London, Ky., the other day.    Issues have never been Mr. Bush's strong point. After running for president in 1980 and after serving eight years as Mr. Reagan's loyal vice president, he has nothing very striking to say now that the most important moment in his political life has arrived.    His one new proposal is a four-year &quot;flexible&quot; freeze on spending. &quot;No one understands what he's talking about,&quot; sniffs Mr. Dole. The senator, no visionary himself, advocates a one-year spending freeze he says would save $150 billion over three years. Both men talk a lot about giving the president a line-item veto, a concept that doesn't arouse much passion.    Here in South Carolina, where Mr. Dole may be running behind both Mr. Bush and Pat Robertson, the discussion is pretty basic: tobacco and textiles. Mr. Dole defends tobacco farmers -- &quot;they've got a right to make a living&quot; -- and supports legislation to limit textile imports. Mr. Bush opposes the textile bill, but he refuses to criticize the senator directly. Mr. Bush usually declines to attack Mr. Dole directly, leaving that heavy work to his operatives and his TV and radio commercials.    But Mr. Bush is willing to take on Mr. Robertson, who is widely seen by Mr. Bush's advisers as a covert ally of Mr. Dole. &quot;I think there's a Robertson-Dole coalition here (in South Carolina),&quot; says Lee Atwater, the Bush campaign chief. &quot;The threat is those two working together.&quot;    Mr. Dole's biggest asset in South Carolina is that state's senior senator, Strom Thurmond, who has endorsed him and who traveled around the state with him this week. Again and again, he struck Mr. Dole's own favorite chord.    Bob Dole, said Mr. Thurmond, &quot;rose from humble beginnings.&quot; He's not &quot;of the so-called elite.&quot; He wasn't born with a silver spoon in his mouth. Nor, it turns out, with a natural ability to make things run smoothly. </TEXT></DOC>
