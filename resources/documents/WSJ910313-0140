Chairman Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.) plans to introducelegislation today aimed at preventing suspected bid-riggingin the politically popular program.</LP><TEXT>   For nearly a year, the Federal Trade Commission has beeninvestigating allegations of price-fixing among the threemajor infant-formula makers, which claim about 93% of themore than $1.6 billion U.S. market. The companies -- RossLaboratories, a unit of Abbott Laboratories; Mead Johnson, aunit of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.; and Wyeth-Ayerst, a unit ofAmerican Home Products Corp. -- are also the targets ofseveral antitrust lawsuits.   The government buys about one-third of the infant formulaproduced in the country for its Women, Infants and Childrenprogram, commonly known as WIC, which provides infantformula, milk, cereal, beans and other nutritious foods forlow-income babies, children and women who are pregnant orbreast-feeding.   If the charges are true, critics contend, the governmentis losing out on millions of dollars, money that Sen. Leahysays could bring more people into the WIC program.Agriculture Committee staff members project that the savingsachieved by his bill could bring states an extra $168 millionin rebates from infant-formula makers, and the money could bespent to add 270,000 people to the WIC program.   The Leahy bill seeks to force greater competition inbidding for WIC contracts by abolishing the currentstate-by-state bidding system and splitting the country intoseven regional markets. Companies would be required to submitsecret bids to be the sole supplier of infant formula in eachregion. Agriculture Committee aides contend that the biggermarkets would force greater competition.   Under the bill, any company that reveals its bids would bebanned from the WIC program for two years.   The bill will almost certainly clear the AgricultureCommittee and has a good chance of winning congressionalapproval because it requires that any money saved be used toadd people to the WIC program. Currently, WIC serves onlyabout 60% of the women and children thought to be eligiblefor the benefits.   Sen. Leahy's committee tomorrow is to conduct a jointhearing with a subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committeeon competition in the infant-formula industry. None of thethree major infant-formula makers has agreed to attend. OnlyCarnation Co., an American subsidary of the Swissconglomerate Nestle S.A., which is trying to break into theU.S. market, is planning to testify.   Bid figures from the federal government compiled by theCenter for Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonprofit groupthat researches poverty issues, show a curious pattern.   On March 6, 1990, not long after Congress passedlegislation requiring competitive bidding for WICinfant-formula suppliers in all states, Mead Johnson told theMontana Department of Health that it intended to offer thestate's WIC program a 75-cent rebate on the retail price ofeach 13-ounce can of infant formula. It sent letters offeringthe same bids to Wisconsin, Oklahoma and Kentucky.   The 75-cent rebate was smaller than all but one of thecompany's previous bids to 13 states. Over eight months, MeadJohnson offered 75-cent rebates to a total of 12 states.During the same period, Ross Labs and Wyeth-Ayerst came inwith 21 bids at or within pennies of 75 cents.   The companies have repeatedly denied price-fixingallegations.</TEXT></DOC>
