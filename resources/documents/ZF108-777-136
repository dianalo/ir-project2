 As vice president and general manager of Novell'sDevelopment Product Division, Woodward is ultimately responsible forsupporting the developers with efforts ranging from software toods tomanuals.andP;  We caught up with Woodward between her trips from Austin to Provoto Cambridge and her preparation for the Developers' Conference in May.andM;From her brand new offices nestled in the green hills of the northwest cornerof Austin, Texas, Woodward tells us how her division is simplifyingdevelopers' choices and lives.andP;  She explains how software development canbecome more automated with remote procedure call tools, object-orientedprogramming, and computer-aided software engineering.andP;  If softwaredevelopment becomes more efficient, then more applications will be able tobetter take advantage of a network's architecture.andP;  Woodward also offersinsight into the proposed Lotus-Novell merger--in the three years sinceNovell purchased her company Softcraft (the basis for the DevelopmentProducts Division), she has seen many acquisitions.andM;LAN Magazine: The combinations and permutations of operating systems andnetwork operating systems, and development environments provide a dauntingnumber of choices for applications developers.andP;  What is the one tool, eitherspecifically or generally, that best advances the development of networksoftware without causing developers undue risks or trouble?andM;Nancy Woodward: The easiest way to help developers face the challenge of somany platforms is to provide them standard development APIs [ApplicationsProgramming Interfaces], so that they don't have to do a completely differenteffort for every different environment they want to support.andP;  Naturally,developers are going to migrate toward the operating systems that are themost established and have the widest installed base because that gives themthe most bang for their buck.andP;  Even if you limit yourself to those choices,there are still different APIs available on different platforms the developercan write to, or port between, as he goes from one to another.andM;Novell tries to support the widest range of APIs possible, and that's why inaddition to supporting our own SPX protocol, in NetWare we support NetBIOS,and we support Named Pipes because that way developers can choose to useprotocols that they can carry across to other platforms.andM;We also provide our development tools for non-NetWare environments.andP;  So ifyou develop applications, for example, with Btrieve, you can also developversions of those applications to run on standalone machines, or with OS/2,or Windows, or DOS, or other networks like LAN Manager, without rewriting anyof your application.andP;  We do give developers the opportunity to do theirdevelopment one time.andM;We also provide tools like RPC [NetWare Remote Procedure Call] that reallyhide the network-specific logic.andP;  So you use a very generic remote procedurecall mechanism for making your procedure calls across the network, and thetool is available for different platforms to actually generate all thecommunications code specific to those platforms.andM;It is a big focus when you are doing development tools to provide productsthat let developers create their application once and be able to carry itacross to other environments.andP;  You can't focus strictly on just supportingyour own platform, because developers, even though they know that today thatmight be where all the market share is, are always wanting to know they havethe option, if they need to, to change directions and go to another platform.andO;And we want to make sure they don't feel locked in when they develop forNetWare.andM;LAN: Client-server applications have not hit the market the way they wereprojected.andP;  What do you think is the biggest impediment to developing theseapplications?andM;Woodward: The hardest implementation area is the communication code betweenthe client and server machine because that's the new element we need to do aclient-server application versus an application that runs on one processor.andO;And most application programmers are not communications programming experts.andO;So they face a big challenge in understanding how to make the two pieces ofthe code talk.andM;Putting the two pieces on two machines they understand, but making theconnection between the two and passing data back and forth is technicallydifficult for many applications programmers, which is another thing that[NetWare] RPC addresses because it generates that communication code for you.andO;So I think that just that concept of having to make the two pieces talk toeach other is probably the hardest thing they've had to face.andM;Architecturally, there are some differences.andP;  You have understand how to takeadvantage of client-server, so that it's buying you something over being justbased on one machine.andP;  That's a new education process for people.andP;  They don'tnecessarily understand the benefits of distributing an application betweenprocessors, and they have to learn that and learn how to architect anapplication for that environment.andP;  And if they don't see that, then theydon't recognize it when they make their first attempts at client-serverbecause they didn't do it in a way that took advantage of the architecture,and they're not going to be as likely to pursue to option of client-serverapplications in the future.andM;The difference of dealing with the fact that you can split your programbetween two machines has been the slowest thing.andP;  It sounded easy to do at ahigh level when people talked about it, but when you come to theimplementation phase of actually making it work and talking between twomachines, people found there was a whole level of complexity they hadn'treally looked at before.andM;LAN: Do you think these difficulties will discourage developers from doingclient-server applications?andM;Woodward: No, I thing the tools are going to come out that will make itpossible--plus the education process.andP;  If you go to different developmentconferences, there's a lot of education going on about how to useclient-server architecture efficiently, how to take advantage of it, and whatthe benefits can be if you design your application correctly.andP;  I thinkdevelopers are learning more how client-server architecture can work fortheir application, and the tools are coming out to make the actualnitty-gritty implementation easier.andM;LAN: There is a significant block of people who can't move to client-serverbecause their applications are written in dBase.andP;  Do you think it makes senseto move a dBase application to client-server?andP;  And if so, what is the biggestroadblock developers must overcome?andM;Woodward: I think it makes sense because dBAse has the same thing to gain asany database application.andP;  With dBase programming, you do relational typeoperations; you ask for certain data from the database based on certainrestrictions, certain filters, and it may be data pulled from more than onetable.andM;The tricky thing is that the dBase language doesn't map well to the SQLlanguage.andP;  dBase can work well talking advantage of relational functionally,but to map a dBase language request directly to an SQL language request hasbeen a very difficult process.andP;  It's not very straightforward.andP;  And I guessno one has done it really successfully up to this point.andM;We have one front-end partner, Communication Horizons, that developed RaSQL,a programming tool that interfaces Clipper to NetWare SQL.andP;  That was one ofthe first fron ends for NetWare SQL to ship, and it's been shipping for aboutthree months now.andM;I think it can be done, but the first attempts of trying to insert SQLdirectly into dBase programs were a lot harder than people expected.andP;  They'reharder for the dBase programmer; he doesn't understand what to do with theseSQL statements in the middle of his dBase program.andP;  And if you don't do itthat way, if you try to map it invisibly, then it's hard for the underneathguy to figure out how to map to SQL over at the server side.andM;But we've worked with a lot of other vendors besides Communication Horizons.andO;We've worked a lot with WordTech and Fox.andP;  And they're getting to understandhow they're going to do it now.andP;  And so I think you are going to see ithappen, but it's just a lot harder than people thought, like Ashton-Tate hastaken a lot longer with dBase IV than we would have expected.andP;  I think it'salmost going to require that the dBase language evolve a little bit to workeasily smoothly.andM;LAN: If a developer has a flat-file database application, do you think hewould be better off starting from scratch with a package oriented moretowards client-server?andM;Woodward: People using Clipper have been able to extend their existingapplications very easily.andP;  Throwing away your application and starting fromscratch is a last resort.andP;  Usually, if you've got something working, the lastthing you want to do is to start over because it's not elegant.andP;  I think thatpeople will transition through products like Clipper and RaSQL, so they cankeep their existing applications running, but start to move toward differentarchitectures and different technologies.andM;LAN: Many proponents of the client-server cast a major role for Windows.andO;They say that Windows--particularly Windows 3.0--will force the developmentof front-end applications.andP;  Do you see Windows as the primary graphicalinterface of the future?andP;  Or do you see another graphical interface, or acharacter-based interface?andM;Woodward: From our point of view, it looks like Windows and OS/2 both havetheir proponents.andP;  Neither is widely accepted in any way like DOS is.andO;They're both kind of leading edge, and there are some companies committed toone, and some to the other.andP;  It's not clear to me which one will be the finalwinner, or maybe they both will exist.andP;  I think that's probably the morelikely scenario.andP;  We're really committed to supporting both, to let theapplication developer use either one, and make our tools available for bothWindows and OS/2.andM;I think that Windows 3.0 is important because it does make Windows a muchstronger competitor.andP;  Windows was a very elegant solution in the past and hada lot of nice ideas buried behind it, but it was kind of cumbersome and slow.andO;3.0 should address a lot of those problems.andP;  I think 3.0 and PM [IBM'sPresentation Manager] are both going to be important graphical interfaces.andO;That's why we're looking at supporting both of them right now.andM;LAN: A lot of companies are jumping on the object-oriented programmingbandwagon, including Apple, IBM, Hewlett-Packard, and Microsoft.andP;  The NewYork Times called it the &quot;oat bran of the software industry.&quot;andP;  How importantis object-oriented programming to the network programmer and to the networkenvironment as a whole?andM;Woodward: I think it will be important.andP;  Part of the problem withobject-oriented programming--it reminds me of groupware--is the term gotpicked up and used in a million different ways so that you don't know whatthey mean by &quot;object-oriented programming.&quot;andP;  But in the true sense of thewords--the kind of object-oriented research and technology that has gone onin educational institutions for ten years now--the concept of dealing withprograms in a little different way, where you're dealing with objects insteadof strict flow control, dealing with events, will become more applicable ifit gets integrated into programming tools.andM;It's not mainstream at this point, in my mind.andP;  I think that more people arestill based in traditional programming languages like plain C, as opposed tousing something that is more object-oriented.andP;  You do see some of theapplication developers starting to base their outline methodology or theirphilosophy on more of an object-oriented approach.andM;So I do expect it's going to become important because it's going to make itsimpler for people to program, just like structured programming came intovogue because it simplified the process.andP;  The benefits of object-orientedprogramming is similar: people can produce code more quickly, it's moremaintainable, more reusable, etc.andP;  But it's like anything else, it takes timebecause there's so much investment.andM;One thing about programming is that once you learn a way to do something andyou have existing applications, it's a huge investment to make a change It'ssomething that can only happen at the right times, like when you're about tostart on a new project that has no past baggage.andM;LAN: When do you see computer-aided software engineering (CASE) becoming moreof a force in software development?andM;Woodward: CASE has been around a long time, and there are places where CASEis a force.andP;  A lot of government and large MIS shops use a lot ofsophisticated CASE tools.andP;  Right now, CASE is a fairly expensive technology,and I guess that's one reason it's limited to those types of developmentsites as opposed to every small developer out there.andP;  But the more complexsoftware development becomes, the more people you put on one project, thebigger the scope of the program you're writing, the more CASE has to offeryou because obviously, the more people you add, the more the communicationsaspect becomes important in controlling your development cycle.andP;  And CASEdoes that for you very well because it documents what everyone else is doing,as well as what you're doing.andP;  And to some extent, it almost automates thesoftware development process.andM;I think it's like any technology.andP;  Software development is learning to becomemore automated, more efficient in the process of programming.andP;  Andobject-oriented [programming] is one thing that is doing that.andP;  It's a way toprogram more efficiently.andP;  And I think CASE is another way.andM;I think CASE tools have a big and important role in the future because itremains that the biggest cost in any kind of system you install is softwaredevelopment.andP;  The programming time is still the biggest cost to get any kindof automation up, so any development tools that we can produce that minimizeor reduce that development time are going to have a future.andP;  It's hard to saywhen, because CASE has been around so long, but you would like to think, withthe power you have in the desktop machines that are now at developers'fingertips, that maybe CASE would have a chance to start taking off some timein the next few years.andM;Lotus, Novell, and the DPDandM;LAN: Some developers are wary of Microsoft because they provide developmenttools, applications software, and a network operating system.andP;  The merger ofLotus and Novell creates a similar setup.andP;  Do you think your third-partydeverlopers will come to perceive the Department Products Division as theircompetition?andM;Woodward: I don't really see Development Products Division producingapplications software.andP;  Our function will stay what it has been, which is tosupport developers.andP;  Now, some application development that we support mightbe Lotus's, which we already do to some extent because they're a Novellthird-party developer.andM;Lots of our developers wouldn't even be said to be competing with Lotus.andP;  Ifyou look at the thousands of developers that are signed up to do NetWareapplications, I don't know if any of them are doing a spreadsheet.andP;  By farthe majority are doing vertical market applications or niche products, evenif they're shrink-wrapped.andP;  They're not going out to beat up WordPerfect orLotus.andM;I think most of our vendors don't even view Lotus as a competitor, and I knowthey wouldn't view us as a competitor because we're not doing applicationsand we're not going to change that focus in our Development Products office.andO;We'll continue to provide them the same tools that we do everyone.andP;  We're notgoing to give Lotus advanced or secret information that we don't give otherpeople.andP;  We develop database engines here, and we don't know any more aboutthe API than what we tell to Oracle or XDB or any of the other third-partycompanies.andM;We can control priorities.andP;  We may come out with completelyNetWare-compatible products sooner than other people because we make it a toppriority, but it's not that we haven't given them the same information at thesame time.andP;  So we'll continue to provide that to other third parties, butyou'll see products come out of Novell, or the Lotus-Novell combination, thatprobably will be ahead of the rest of the market because that will be ourfirst priority.andP;  But we don't intend to use undocumented calls or somethingthat we won't tell outside users about.andM;LAN: At the San Francisco press conference announcing the Lotus-Novellmerger, Ray Noorda commented that he didn't see any cultural differencebetween Provo and Cambridge.andP;  Judging from your experiences coming fromSoftcraft and Austin, how do you see the different cultures mesh at Lotus andNovell?andM;Woodward: There's always some geographical flavor to an office.andP;  This officein Texas has some different characteristics from California.andP;  In California,you get a little bit of the high-tech craze, where everyboly knows what thepeople down the street are doing.andP;  Provo has a little different culture.andP;  Butthe three offices of Novell are so much involved in the same industry and thesame technology that when you put the people together there really isn't acultural difference, per se.andP;  Everyone has the same philosophy of what thecompany is trying to do, what our position is in the industry, and what we'retrying to achieve.andP;  If anything makes it fun, it is that we have people fromdifferent parts of the country so you can get a little bit of the flavor ofdifferent places when you travel.andM;We haven't had any cultural clashes to speak of at all since the merger [ofSoftcraft and Novell].andP;  One of the reasons we [Softcraft] chose to go withNovell is that we felt as a company they had a lot of the same philosophiesand orientation toward employees that we do.andP;  And in my experience withLotus, I think they're very much the same.andP;  I think it's the way any softwarecompany has to be to survive in this industry; you have to beemployee-oriented because the people are your best resource.andM;NetWare DevelopmentsandM;LAN: How would you compare LAN Manager, NetWare 386, and Unix as developmentenvironments?andM;Woodward: If you're a developer, I think the first thing you would look at isthe installed base, and NetWare 386 has a bigger installed base because it'scompatible with other NetWare versions.andM;The problem with Unix is that everyone is different.andP;  No one Unix packagethat you write could be shrink wrapped and distributed to a single marketlike NetWare offers.andP;  You could be like Oracle and do a lot of Unix versions,and if you've got the power to really maintain 80 versions of an applicationfor 80 different Unixes, then there's a good market there.andP;  But a lot ofsoftware developers can't face that kind of maintenance challenge.andP;  So Ithink the first thing you'd see when you look at those three to decide who toprogram for is that you're going to have much more installed base withNetWare 386.andM;[NetWare 386] is also a little different development environment.andP;  With 386,it's strictly defined as the backend part of your development process.andP;  We'renot presenting a platform that is to be your client side and your serverside.andP;  The operating system at the server is tuned just for those types ofapplications.andP;  So you'll find if you go to write a database back end thatNetWare 386 has all the kind of functions you want for that, but it doesn'thave a lot of windowing and keyboard and mouse control and user interfacetype functions because we don't do that on the server.andP;  Instead, we have theties out to a bunch of different client environments so you can choose [thecliet] you want, whether it's Macintosh or DOS or OS/2.andM;LAN Manager is a different approach.andP;  You have one OS whether you're theclient or the server.andP;  I guess you could say it's a benefit that you don'thave to learn two OSs.andP;  But it's a disadvantage because that OS is not astuned for either one.andP;  It's trying to be all things to all people so it's notgoing to be as efficient at the back end as NetWare 386 because it's also gotthe overhead associated with supporting multiple end user applications orsessions running on the desktop.andM;As for Unix, as a developer, the biggest challenge you face is if you want tosell a shrink-wrapped package; there's not a good platform to pick and knowthat you've got a big market share, and there's not a distribution channelthat's necessarily selling a lot of shrink-wrapped software just for aparticular version of Unix.andM;We try to make NetWare 386 the choice a developer would want to pick forclient-server applications, and I think those are the reasons that we'd sayit was the first choice.andM;LAN: NetWare 386 is a powerful operating system.andP;  Yet without applicationsthat operate as NetWare Loadable Modules (NLMs), much of that power cannot befully used.andP;  When do you foresee the trickle of available NLM-basedapplications moving to a steady stream?andM;Woodward: I think that's going to happen very shortly.andP;  We've demonstrated atNetworld Boston 40 different NLMs.andP;  When you install a network, you may notsee it, but there's a lot of NLM development that has already happened tosupport your LAN card drivers, backup devices, and printers.andP;  These are notglamorous applications, so you don't really see that you're taking advantageof NLMs.andP;  To some extent you're not; you're doing what you did with the oldnetwork.andP;  The first ones [NLMs] you see are the nuts and bolts type tools.andM;The database product is probably the first one that you will recognize as anapplication.andP;  There are already products (the Btrieve NLM began shipping todevelopers last month) that open the door for a lot of applications.andP;  TheNetWare SQL NLM is coming out within the next couple of months.andP;  But theother database vendors are all very close, and I think you'll see severalmajor ones come out before the end of the year.andM;LAN: What does a developer need to do to his application to make it work withan NLM version of Btrieve or NetWare SQL?andM;Woodward: Nothing.andP;  If you've got an application that calls Btrieve that runson a client, there's no change.andM;LAN: Would the developer benefit by doing optimization?andM;Woodward: There are a lot of new features going into NetWare SQL and Btrieve.andO;We released NetWare version 5.10 of Btrieve a couple of months ago.andP;  NetWareSQL is including support for stored statements, embedded SQL procedures,applications instead of just a function call interface.andP;  But the more power,the more of those features you use, the more you'll see a benefit withNetWare 386 because it becomes more of a load on the server environment.andM;LAN: As part of the NLM testing program, developers get two tools: NuMega forchecking memory pointers and Recorder for writing test scripts.andP;  Why werethese the two most important products for developers to have?andM;Woodward: NuMega is important because NetWare 386, in order to give you fullfunctionality and efficiency, is letting you run in [the 386 chip's]unprotected mode.andP;  So the most common type of errors you need to check for inyour development process are where you are accessing beyond your memory spacebecause you could be hurting other applications on the server or the serveroperating itself.andP;  The NuMega tool is really important to help developersdebug those things.andM;We're adding some tools of our own in future releases of NetWare 386 fordevelopers that will do that with Novell tools.andP;  But NuMega was able toprovide technology sooner for us and I thought that was important.andM;The Recorder was important to do more thorough testing, so you could repeatthe tests.andM;LAN: What do you expect will be the major concern of developers at theupcoming conference?andM;Woodward: I think a lot of people are waiting on NetWare [version] 3.1.andP;  Alot of developers, whether they need it or not, believe they need the 3.1,not the 3.0 NetWare, since they know another version is coming.andP;  That's goingto be released this summer.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
