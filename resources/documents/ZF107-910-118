withthose basic ingredients, a producer can create 20 completely differentrecords, which do share family characteristics, and in a similar manner,pre-written software routines can be ordered in various ways and linkedtogether with a modicum of new code (equivalent to the vocal track) to createa variety of different applications that will have elements in common; theonly worry the analogy raises is that the new record is never anywhere nearas good as the original Aretha Franklin track - will the same be true ofsubsequent programs compared with the ones for which the objects werecreated?andM;- o -andM;Mannesman-Tally GmbH's Wokingham, Berkshire-based operation has launched theMT645 line printer for use on personal computer networks: it uses an Intel80188 processor and will go to 450 lines per minute for #3,990, with IBMProprinter, Printronix P600 and Epson FX emulation.andM;- o -andM;NEC Technologies Inc has a new Silentwriter2 290 300 dot-per-incheight-page-per-minute PostScript laser printer: driven by a 16.7MHz 68000,the thing has 2Mb memory expandable to 4Mb, an Adobe PostScript interpreterand 35 resident scalable typefaces;
