But an unusual organization isteaching hundreds of them how to reduce the danger, short of hiringarmed guards and driving armor-plated cars.</TEXT><BYLINE>By KATHY EYRE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>OXFORD, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Taking some cues from the Bible itself, agroup of Christian law enforcement specialists and other volunteersis teaching American missionaries abroad how to protect themselvesfrom terrorists.   As security tightens around the traditional political andeconomic targets, terrorists are striking at the more vulnerablereligious community overseas, according to Chester L. Quarles ofOxford, one of the founders of the unusual organization.   Quarles, the director of the University of Mississippi's lawenforcement program, helped form Contingency PreparationConsultants, a private non-profit group based in Ventura, Calif.,that has provided anti-terrorism training for more than 500missionaries from 18 denominations.   ``We believe God is in control. But we believe as in Ephesians6:10-18 that we should put on the whole armor of God and use all ofthe knowledge, skill and ability we have to survive as soul-winningevangelical Christians,'' Quarles tells people attending hisworkshops.   ``A missionary cannot afford an armor-plated Mercedes-Benz andwould not want an armed guard,'' Quarles says. But missionaries canbe taught ways to avoid becoming victims of terrorism and increasetheir chances of not being harmed if kidnapped or involved in aplane hijacking.   ``We see this as a ministry,'' says Quarles, the son of the lateChester L. Quarles Sr., who served for years as executive secretaryand treasurer of the Southern Baptist Convention Board. ``Each ofus had a deep desire to put our specialized knowledge, skills andexpertise to work in the service of the Lord. We come fromdifferent denominational backgrounds but share the bond of Christ'slove.''   Others helping in the training of missionaries are Ted Childressof Knoxville, Tenn., a retired FBI agent who is now director oftraining for a major defense contractor; Richard Farley of LaJolla, Calif., a clinical psychologist; and Bob Klamser of Ventura,Calif., a police lieutenant who commands his department's HostageNegotiation Team.   Quarles says that in the past two years he's traveled to ninecountries to conduct his anti-terrorism workshops, which last 2{days. Quarles has had several articles published in thenon-denominational ``Evangelical Missions Quarterly'' and he'swriting a book on missionaries and terrorism.   Almost 50 American missionaries have suffered violent deathsaround the world in the past 20 years, including two from theKansas City Pentecostal Fellowship who were among 10 people hackedto death by terrorists last November in Zimbabwe.   Klamser, the president of Contingency Preparation Consultants,says he personally knows of eight American missionaries who havesuffered violent deaths abroad in the past five years.   Four missionaries are currently being held hostage.   While most of the missionaries have been released unharmed,Quarles expects ``things to get worse before they get better.''   America's 100,000 missionaries abroad ``are being singled outmore by terrorists,'' he says. ``But they're not being focused uponbecause they are Christians. They're being focused upon becausethey're Americans and they're Westerners.''   The U.S. government and private corporations have spent millionsof dollars beefing up security at offices overseas, and there about30 private organizations worldwide specializing in anti-terroristtraining.   But Quarles says missionary groups can't afford to bring inprivate help.   Contingency asks for reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses,such as travel. The workshop speakers donate their time.   The missionaries also turn to Contingency PreparationConsultants because the group provides instructors with a Christianbackground.   Often the zeal of the missionaries makes them unduly confidentin troubled lands, putting themselves as well as others in danger,Quarles says. For example, it took a lot of talking to persuade oneProtestant missionary in Honduras to leave the village where he wasserving even though intelligence sources had indicated he wastargeted by a terrorist group. He eventually left, for the sake ofthe village.   Each anti-terrorism workshop begins with several scripturalreferences illustrating the concepts to be taught. For example,Paul and Silas fled enemies in Thessalonica even though localchurch members had asked them to stay.   David Archibald is among those who have attended Quarles'workshop. He moved in June from Waxhaw, N.C., to Peru onadministrative assignment for Jungle Aviation and Radio Service,the technical support arm of Wycliffe Bible Translators of Dallas.   Wycliffe has hundreds of people in 48 countries and wanted itsstaff to be more aware of security. Archibald says he had traveledin foreign countries while working for private industry, but hadnever heard many of the safety tips provided by Quarles.   ``The typical thing was to have a business card on yourbriefcase,'' Archibald says. ``Quarles cautioned that that was aninvitation to a terrorist'' looking for someone with anadministrative or ecclesiastical position.   ``If you are traveling in an area where airline hijackingsoccur, Quarles said to stay away from doors, don't sit next to theaisle where terrorists can more easily reach you. Things like thatI hadn't thought of,'' he said.   Mission Aviation Fellowship of Redlands, Calif., began usingQuarles' workshops following the abduction of 33-year-old pilot DanRogers in Surinam. Rogers was kidnapped by the group ``JungleCommandos'' last Oct. 30 and released unharmed on Nov. 7.   ``In our opinion, they're one of the best,'' says MariannePielin, executive assistant to the president of Mission Aviation.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, July 31</NOTE></DOC>
