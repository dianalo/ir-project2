Owing to adjustible fluidic propertiesof polymer solutions to which by variation of recipe even rubber sealquality can be given, methods of well-treatment for temporary or permanent,selective or complete tightening have become possible. Selective watersealing applied to oil wells in Hungary resulted in additional oil recoveryat low cost. In gas wells this method has not yet stood its test, however,resulted in reduced water/gas-ratio. Complete inflow-preventive tighteningto the effect of secondary sealing or plugging of wells has become anestablished technique. Further applications, e.g. inside drilling holesand behind casings, are possible.</TEXT></DOC>
