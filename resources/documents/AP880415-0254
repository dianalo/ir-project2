The Department of Transportation on Wednesday charged 25accountants, auditors, economists and financial analysts withdelving into a complex structure that has steeped the ailingcarrier in controversy and made it the target of labor unionhostility.   Houston-based Texas Air, which commands 20 percent of the U.S.market, is the parent company of major carriers Eastern Airlinesand Continental Airlines.   A key figure in the government's probe will be Texas AirChairman Frank Lorenzo who aggressively built the company from asmall intrastate carrier into an airline empire. Unions and othercritics have accused Lorenzo of siphoning off Eastern andContinental assets into the parent company.   Recent Texas Air filings with the Securities and ExchangeCommission indicated that both Eastern and Continental ``are undersubstantial, increasing financial pressure,'' TransportationSecretary Jim Burnley said in announcing the investigation.   Documents indicate, for example, that Texas Air's cash reserveswere drained last year at a rate of more than $1 million a day, andthat the company has around $7 billion in liabilities related toleasing planes.   The government's financial probe will examine the corporation'smanagement and business practices and the relationships between theparent, Eastern and Continental, said DOT General Counsel B. WayneVance. The department's deputy general counsel, Rosalind Knapp,will head the investigation.   While Texas Air controls Eastern and Continental, Houston-basedContinental itself is the parent of other Lorenzo acquisitions:Frontier Airlines, People Express and New York Air. All three haveceased operating _ Frontier is in bankruptcy _ but Continental hasabsorbed their assets.   Texas Air also operates several commuter carriers: RockyMountain Airways, Britt Airways, Bar Harbor Airlines andProvincetown-Boston Airlines.   Together, the Texas Air carriers have a huge debt of around $5.4billion, but Lorenzo has set up a corporate structure thatinsulates the parent itself from most of the burden. The parentcompany sustained record losses of $466 million last year.   The Wall Street Journal recently likened the complex corporatearchitecture to a house of many rooms: Every room has a payingtenant and a bank can foreclose on an individual room, but not onthe whole house. The landlord has many partners, but no one canchallenge his management of the property.   The setup allows cash to move upstream from loss-making TexasAir units to the parent _ in the form of management fees, rents onplanes and airport gates, commissions on fuel purchases and others.   In its order for an investigation, the DOT said a number offinancial transactions between the parent and Eastern andContinental ``raise questions concerning whether substantial fundsand other resources are being diverted from the air carriersubsidiaries.''   The department questioned, for example:   _Texas Air shifting Eastern's profitable computer reservationsystem into a separate subsidiary in exchange for a note ``whichmay be less than the system's fair market value.''   _Eastern paying ``substantial fees'' for management services,fuel purchases and other activities provided by the parent company.   _Eastern accepting a no-interest note, instead of cash, for $16million in reimbursements owed to the airline as part of itsacquisition by Texas Air.   _Texas Air borrowing $25 million from Eastern in March 1987 inexchange for an unsecured note at a time when Eastern was havingcash flow problems.   Texas Air recently proposed to spin off Eastern's profitableNortheast shuttle service in exchange for an infusion of $225million in cash and securities for the strapped airline, but thatattempt has been blocked by federal courts.   While the DOT looks into the financial condition of Texas Air,Eastern and Continental, the Federal Aviation Administration isundertaking a stringent safety investigation of Miami-basedEastern. The FAA on Wednesday fined Eastern $823,000 because of``recurring trends'' of violations of safety regulations, and onThursday temporarily grounded five Eastern planes for minor safetyviolations.</TEXT></DOC>
