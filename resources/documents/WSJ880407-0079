Morgan Stanley Group Inc., the only major publicly held securities firm to have a year-to-year earnings rise in 1987, also was the only one to boost the pay of its top executives. Bosses at other big firms saw their earnings plunge along with those of their firms, but this being Wall Street, their compensation was generally still in the seven-figure range.    Lighter personal and corporate wallets were the rule at Salomon Inc., First Boston Inc., PaineWebber Group Inc., Shearson Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and Merrill Lynch andamp; Co.    In moving its five top executives into or very near the lofty $3 million-a-year neighborhood, Morgan Stanley might have been rubbing it in: the five each made more than any chief executive officer at a major rival.    Topping the compensation charts were Morgan Stanley Chairman S. Parker Gilbert, President Richard B. Fisher and executive committee member Robert F. Greenhill, each of whom made $3 million last year. Next in line were executive committee members Lewis W. Bernard and John J. Mack, at $2.85 million. In 1986, Messrs. Gilbert and Fisher each made $2.85 million and Messrs. Bernard and Greenhill earned $2.7 million each. Mr. Mack's 1986 compensation wasn't available.    Morgan Stanley earned a record $230.9 million in 1987, up 15% from 1986. The firm declined to comment on the pay figures.    The lowest cash compensation for a senior Wall Street official went to Salomon Chairman John H. Gutfreund, who decided not to take a bonus for 1987 and settled for his $300,000 salary and a bunch of stock options, a big drop from the $3.2 million he earned in 1986. A spokesman said that in a year of tighter budgets, Mr. Gutfreund wanted to make sure there was enough bonus money available for other employees. But Mr. Gutfreund also received $800,000 deferred from 1984. Salomon's earnings for 1987 plunged to $142 million from $516 million.    Firms generally report to the Securities and Exchange Commission only the earnings of their top five corporate officers. Many big wage earners, such as heads of mergers and acquisitions, often make more than their corporate chiefs, but their compensation isn't reported because they are considered officers of the firm's broker-dealer subsidiary and exempt from the reporting requirements.    First Boston's former head of mergers and acquisitions, Bruce Wasserstein, for example, is said by many on Wall Street to have earned at least $6 million last year, a figure he has declined to comment on.    Firms that are privately held, such as Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., don't make compensation figures public.    At PaineWebber, Chairman Donald B. Marron earned $1.98 million, down from $2.7 million in 1986. PaineWebber earned $72 million, down only 3.9% from a year earlier. Mr. Marron had no comment on his compensation.    First Boston Chief Executive Peter T. Buchanan and Chairman Alvin V. Shoemaker each earned $1.95 million, down from their 1986 compensation of $3 million each, almost as far down as First Boston's profit, which plunged 40% to $108.9 million. A First Boston spokesman declined to comment.    Shearson Chairman Peter A. Cohen earned $1.44 million, down sharply from $2.96 million in 1986. The firm's earnings fell even more sharply, off 70% to $101 million. &quot;I think compensation should fluctuate with the performance of the firm,&quot; Mr. Cohen said. &quot;We were having a great year until October happened, but it did happen, and I think our compensation should suffer accordingly.&quot;    Merrill Lynch Chairman William A. Schreyer earned $1.9 million, down $1 million from 1986. Merrill's earnings fell 14% to $390.6 million. Through a spokesman, Mr. Schreyer declined to comment.    The paycheck of Wall Street's biggest individual money maker last year, Alan C. Greenberg, chairman of Bear Stearns Cos., won't be available until after the firm's fiscal year ends this month. To approach his fiscal 1987 compensation of $5.7 million, &quot;we'd have to have a pretty spectacular April,&quot; Mr. Greenberg quipped. </TEXT></DOC>
