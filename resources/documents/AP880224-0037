Reagan also may be asked about his embattled attorney general,Edwin Meese III, the target of an investigation by an independentcounsel, and the separate felony convictions of former White Houseaides and presidential confidants Lyn Nofziger and Michael K.Deaver.   Also still awaited is Reagan's reaction to a plan by HouseDemocrats for $25 million in ``humanitarian'' aid for Nicaragua'sContras, a package that was put together after rejection of thepresident's proposal to give the rebels new weapons.   On the political front, Reagan has doggedly steered clear ofinvolvement in the GOP presidential race. However, he may betempted to comment on the increasingly sharp words betweenRepublicans, given that he is the author of the so-called 11thcommandment forbidding Republicans to speak ill of each other.   The 8 p.m. EST session in the East Room will be Reagan's firstnews conference since last Oct. 22, which was dominated byquestions about the 508-point collapse of the stock market.   A lot has happened since then, and Reagan has had little to sayexcept in prepared speeches. He has been largely isolated from thepress, commenting only occasionally in response to a shoutedquestion as he boards a helicopter or to a query during apicture-taking ceremony in the Oval Office.   Tonight's session comes amid intense diplomatic activity bySecretary of State George Shultz in Moscow and the Middle East.   Shultz, who arrived back in Washington on Tuesday evening, wasreporting to Reagan today on his talks in Moscow about armscontrol, the timing of a superpower summit and the likelihood of aRed Army pullout from Afghanistan.   All of those issues pose possible questions for Reagan.   With barely a day back in the capital, Shultz leaves againtonight, this time to the Middle East where he will meet with Araband Israeli leaders about efforts to revive peace negotiations.   White House officials say there is an urgency to Shultz' effortsin the Middle East because of the violence in the occupied WestBank and Gaza. The United Nations says 63 Palestinians have beenkilled by Israeli gunfire since violence began Dec. 8.   Shultz said Tuesday he has encountered ``intense skepticism''about the chances of a breakthrough on Middle East negotiations,but the United States has ``a few ideas'' that could help end thedeadlock.   Reagan likely will be asked about the kidnapping in Lebanon ofMarine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins and the eight other Americansseized there.   Higgins, onetime aide to former Defense Secretary CasparWeinberger, was serving with U.N. forces when he was taken insouthern Lebanon last Wednesday. Reagan raised some questions bysaying he wanted ``to rescue'' Higgins, but aides later clarifiedthat he was referring to diplomatic efforts, not a militarymaneuver.   A group calling itself the Organization of the Oppressed onEarth claims to have abducted Higgins. The group is demandingIsraeli withdrawal from the ``security zone'' it maintains in southLebanon, release of Palestinian and Lebanese prisoners held byIsrael and suspension of U.S. diplomatic activity in the MiddleEast.</TEXT></DOC>
