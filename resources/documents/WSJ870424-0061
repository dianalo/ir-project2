The loss, on revenue of $168.1 million, was reported Tuesday. In 1986, the Pittsburgh-based construction materials, energy development and environmental services company posted profit from continuing operations equivalent to 61 cents a share on revenue of $700 million. A loss from discontinued operations of $22.2 million and an extraordinary gain of $27.5 million made net income $14.2 million, or 99 cents a share. &quot;Overly optimistic appraisals of 1987's prospects, reached both internally and in the financial markets, prompted us to alert all parties to the need for a more realistic assessment,&quot; Robert Dickey III, chairman and president, told shareholders. </TEXT></DOC>
