In ballots counted Monday night, those members of the SeattleProfessional Engineering Employees Association voted 69 percent toreject a three-year contract offer from the world's largestcommercial airline builder.   Although members also voted by 52 percent not to authorize theirnegotiators to call a strike, the union said it might be well into1990 before the contract talks resume.   ``Our executive director has been in touch with the director oflabor relations at Boeing and we've made known our availability atany time,'' said Dan Mahoney, union general counsel.   ``However, it appears the rejection was quite a surprise tocompany negotiators and they weren't prepared for it, so they haveto assemble their negotiating team.''   Company negotiators apparently had made commitments to otheractivities and face a logistical problem in getting them all backtogether, Mahoney said.   ``Right now, if I had to guess, it would be after the first ofthe year'' before negotiations will resume, Mahoney said.   Boeing officials were meeting to discuss the situation, butthere was no indication when talks might resume, company spokesmanPaul Binder said.   The engineering union's other unit, which represents Boeingtechnical and support workers, ratified a separate three-year pactby nearly 2 to 1. Both contracts expired Dec. 1.   The offer rejected by engineers, who now make an average ofnearly $40,000 a year, included a 3 percent wage increase, aproductivity bonus of 10 percent of gross pay in the first year andno further general increases.   Technicians, with average pay of about $28,000, accepted wageincreases of up to 3 percent and bonuses of up to 10 percent.   Mahoney said the union was sending a survey to its engineermembers ``so when we do go to the table we'll know what to askfor.''   He added, however, that ``the engineers feel the money offerundervalued their services. I do believe they (company negotiators)will have to offer more money.''   Members of the International Association of Machinists andAerospace Workers voted Nov. 18 to end a 48-day strike and accept athree-year pact.</TEXT></DOC>
