The data for the design and construction of a250 t/d-pilot plant such as the materials and structures of the components,piping and instruments were obtained. The overhaul inspection was madeto observe the situation of the equipment as well as take the samplesfor the material tests of equipment. The samples were submitted to destructivetests such as the inspection of structure, Charpy test, tensile testand chemical analysis. After sampling, the components of the plant werediverted to the 1 t/d-process supporting unit and sold to effectivelyutilize the property. In putting together the findings, the coal-derivedliquid was analyzed again to compare with petroleum oil and the experimentwas made using the high-temperature and high-pressure viscometer to supplementthe data from the experimental plant and further develop the NEDOL process.</TEXT></DOC>
