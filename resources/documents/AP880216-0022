(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Vice President George Bush forecast a winbut Sen. Bob Dole also expressed optimism Monday as the GOPpresidential field sprinted for the finish line in a tight NewHampshire primary race. Democrat Michael Dukakis said his expectedwin might be smaller than predicted.   ``I sense a rising tide,'' said Bush. The vice president threwall the resources he could muster into his bid to arrest Dole'sweek-long surge, campaigning side by side and in a hurriedly tapedtelevision commercial with Barry Goldwater, patron saint ofconservatives.   ``It feels good, like it did in Iowa last Monday,'' counteredDole, hoping to ride to victory on the strength of the momentumspawned by last week's caucus win.   One candidate after another posted hopeful predictions of asurprise when New Hampshire voters render their verdict in thenation's lead-off primary on Tuesday.   ``I don't know where all those political pundits are today butthey ran for cover four years ago and they're likely to run forcover tomorrow,'' said former Delaware Gov. Pete du Pont, back inthe pack in the GOP race.   Rep. Jack Kemp, his GOP candidacy on the line, held out the hopeof a second-place finish that would confound the pollsters. ``I'mgoing to finish in a good competitive third or higher,'' he said.   Democratic Sen. Paul Simon, also facing tough times if hefalters, said he was sure he'd defeat Rep. Richard Gephardt forsecond place. Referring to Dukakis' commanding lead in the polls,he said, ``I think there is a possibility of a real surprise comingtomorrow.''   Fellow Democrat Bruce Babbitt, far off the pace in the polls,said, ``I'm anticipating a strong showing and a surprise but Ican't put a number on it.''   Former television evangelist Pat Robertson bid to deal with atempest that arose over his claim that the Soviet Union hasoffensive nulcear missiles in Cuba. The Reagan administrationdenied the claim, but the GOP hopeful said, ``The least we can dois remove those nuclear missiles.''   Democrat Dukakis' lead seemed secure, to judge by the polls, buthe and his aides worried that they would be held to an impossiblestandard when the New Hampshire results are analyzed. Thus, henoted that his rivals have been attacking him regularly, adding,``I assume that's going to take its toll.''   No two polls were alike. But they all showed a Republican raceas close as the Democratic campaign was not.   First results from New Hampshire, as usual, came from themountain hamlet of Dixville Notch, where midnight voters favoredBush and Gephardt, who claimed 11 and 4 votes respectively.   In the rest of the Republican field, Dole had 6, Kemp 5, du Pont2, Alexander Haig 2, Robertson 1. The only Democrat besidesGephardt to get any votes was Simon, who received 3.   Dukakis, governor in next-door Massachusetts, held a commandinglead among the Democrats with support of roughly 40 percent of thevoters. Gephardt and Simon, who finished a close one-two in Iowa'scaucuses last week, are in a duel for second place. Jesse Jackson,Babbitt, Gary Hart and Sen. Albert Gore Jr. are far afield in thepolls.   Among the Republicans, the surveys said that Dole has wiped outall of Bush's once-commanding lead in the eight days since theKansas senator won the Iowa caucuses and the vice president slippedto third place behind Pat Robertson. Robertson, Kemp and former duPont are in a close fight for third place in the same surveys.   What the polls couldn't say was whether Dole's momentum wouldcarry him past a struggling Bush to first place.   The vice president had his re-tooled, informal campaign style ondisplay. He went from one restaurant to another to greet voters atbreakfast time, ordering pancakes at one stop, sipping coffee at asecond and eating an Egg McMuffin during a visit to a McDonald's.   Bush attacked Dole's call for a spending freeze as a ``copout''that avoids making tough decisions, and forecast a victory forhimself in the lead-off primary.   ``I'm going to win tomorrow. Believe me,'' he told a cheeringcrowd at Daniel Webster Colleger in Nashua.   In the five-minute television commercial, Goldwater called Bushthe ``best qualified candidate of my lifetime _ other than me,George.'' Addressing the voters, Bush said, ``Who can you mosttrust to continue the Reagan Revolution?''   Dole and his senior aides sounded confident. ``I think it's thatclose,'' said Dole, who said a victory in New Hampshire might carryhim all the way to the GOP nomination.   ``I'm always skeptical until the polls close,'' he said, butthen added that he had followed his pollster's example and ``sleptwell last night.''   William Brock, Dole's campaign manager, said that no matter whatthe outcome, Bush was a loser in New Hampshire. ``You can't have acampaign that collapses this fast and have any credibility,'' hesaid.   While Bush bid to salvage New Hampshire, Brock already waslooking beyond.   As for the Bush campaign's claim to have a ``firewall ofsupport'' in Southern states which hold primaries and caucuses nextmonth, Brock said, ``It's made of straw. Straw burns pretty fast.''   But Bush's campaign manager maintained that Dole's New Hampshiresurge had stalled. ``Bush was a little behind but he's moving up,''said Lee Atwater.   Among the Democrats, Simon urged New Hampshire's voters ``toassert their independence'' from Dukakis. ``There is a differencebetween me and Michael Dukakis, a difference in experience, adifference in commitment,'' he said.   Dukakis had a speech prepared taking aim at Gephardt and Simon,but he chose not to deliver it when he faced a high school audiencein Claremont.   ``This campaign is not about the past, it is about creating afuture in which all of you can work,'' he said.   Gephardt made no attack on Dukakis or Simon in the final fullday of campaigning. ``Stand with me tomorrow and we will reformAmerica,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
