Ads for clothing and other non-tobacco items using a symbol ortrademark of a tobacco brand will be banned if the 12 EEC statesadopt the European Economic Community Commsision proposal.   It also suggested forcing tobacco makers to display any of 12health warnings in their ads and that ads for a particular brand ofcigarettes only show a pack of cigarettes and their tar content.   Any warning about the health hazards of smoking should cover atleast 10 percent of the advertisements' total space, the Commissionrecommended.   The Commission said in a statement it made its proposals as partof its `Europe Against Cancer' program. Annually, 440,000 EECnationals die of diseases caused or aggravated by smoking, it said.   The requirement that only a cigarette packet and the tar contentbe shown in advertisements is already in effect in France.   But of the 12 EEC states only Portugal and Ireland have a totalban on tobacco advertising. Greece, Luxembourg and Spain have fewrestrictions on such ads.   In the other six EEC nations tobacco ads must carry the samehealth warning that appears on the packet.   The Commission's proposals for EEC-wide rules on tobacco adsmust be approved by the European Parliament and the 12 EEC statesbefore they can take effect.</TEXT></DOC>
