Approximatelyhalf of the 400 sources discovered by Uhuru and its successor Ariel-5are galactic objects: binary systems containing neutron stars and possiblyblackholes, X-ray bursters, supernova remnants and transients. The extragalacticsources are mainly clusters of galaxies as well as Seyfert galaxies andBL Lac Objects. The identifications and follow-up studies of these sourceshave produced the main advances in X-ray astronomy in the first halfof the 1970's. The follow-up surveys with the A-1, A-2 and A-4 instrumentson HEAO-1, provided an increase in spectral coverage and somewhat highersensitivities. The A-1 experiment detected more than 800 sources withfluxes 0.5 mCrab in the 1-25 keV band. In view of the limited positionalresolution of the collimated detectors used in these missions, identificationshave been a problem. In this context the rotation modulation collimatorsflown on SAS-3 and HEAO-1 (A-3 experiment) have played a major role.In this paper the author concentrates on some scientific and technicalaspects of the X-ray sky survey. ROSAT is a German satellite with substantialUS and UK (XUV wide field camera) contributions. The ROSAT X-ray opticsconsist of a fourfold nested mirror system of Wolter type I with 83 cmaperture having an intrinsic resolution of a few arcseconds. The focalplane assembly comprises two position sensitive proportional counters(PSPC) and one high resolution imager (HRI), which are mounted on a carousel.This paper also shows a cross section of the X-ray telescope.</TEXT></DOC>
