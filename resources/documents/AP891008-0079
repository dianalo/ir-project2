Still smarting from the political fiasco last February underwhich Congress was forced by public outrage to reject a 51 percentraise, House leaders have agreed on a set of conditions for thenext attempt to raise lawmakers' salaries.   Foremost among them were that there will be a record vote andthat the increase in pay will be coupled with a phasing out ofspeaking fees members of Congress receive from interest groups.   The agreement, as outlined by a Democratic leadership source whoinsisted on anonymity, also includes a demand for active WhiteHouse support and a commitment from party organizations to refrainfrom using the pay vote as a political issue.

Delegates from more than 100 countries will meet until Oct. 20at the biennial conference of the Convention on International Tradein Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, known as CITES. Theconference began Sunday with strategy sessions and formally opensMonday.   Although they will also consider the smooth-coated otter, thesalmon-crested cockatoo and a Noah's Ark of other species,attention is focused on pachyderms and their valuable ivory.   By some reckoning, the great lumbering African elephant, formany an unmatchable symbol of the wild, will survive mainly in zoosby the turn of the century.</TEXT><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   IBM is offering early retirement to 1,000 of itsemployees; Borden's plan to reorganize its dairy operations willcost 7,000 jobs, and the megabuyout of RJR Nabisco will result inmore than 1,600 layoffs.
