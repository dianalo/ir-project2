Baker III saidWednesday that the Salvadoran government's domestic crackdown wasan ``absolutely appropriate'' response to rebel attacks on U.S. andother targets.   Earlier, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said whenasked about the government's crackdown, ``Our response is that wedeplore violence and killing on both sides.''   The leftist guerillas ``briefly overran'' the home of at leastone U.S. Embassy officer in the early morning outbreak of fighting,Baker told reporters, also saying, ``We are taking steps to assurethe safety of embassy personnel.''   Administration officials said all the Americans escaped injury.   The State Department, meanwhile, set up a 24-hour task force tomonitor the events in El Salvador.   The task force said in a statement that the family whose homewas briefly seized had been ``safely evacuated by Salvadorangovernment forces'' and that the Americans were ``not actually inthe hands of the guerrillas at any time.''   The rebels ``appeared to seize this residence at random,'' saidtask force spokesman David Denny.   After the pre-dawn attack, embassy personnel were told not toreport to work Wednesday and the embassy was closed for the day,said White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk.   However, said Denny, ``several families are unable to leavetheir homes because of fighting'' in the neighborhoods of SanBenito, Escalon and San Francisco.   U.S. Embassy spokesman Barry Jacobs said in San Salvador that acharter flight might depart Thursday with embassy dependents whowant to leave. Embassy personnel who planned to go home forChristmas would leave early, he said.   Baker said President Bush will press Soviet President Mikhail S.Gorbachev on Central America during their shipboard summit thisweekend in the Mediterranean. The secretary said Bush wants theSoviet Union to make sure its Nicaraguan ally adheres to Sovietassurances to the administration that East Bloc weapons will not gothrough Managua to the Salvadoran rebels.   In Paris, the newspaper Le Monde said Wednesday that the SovietUnion has told both Nicaragua and Cuba to stop supplying arms tothe Salvadoran rebels. The newspaper said those instructions weregiven to high Cubana and Nicaraguan officials at a secret meetingin Managua, the Nicaraguan capital, called by the Soviet ambassador.   ``It's in their power to assure themselves that they will not belied to in the future. We'd like to see them exercise that,'' Bakersaid, referring to the Soviets.   He decried ``the continuing pattern of Soviet arms shipments toMoscow's Third World clients,'' saying that in the case of CentralAmerica it was a ``disturbing approach of throwing fuel on thefire.''   Baker spoke a few hours before it was learned in Washington thata CIA plane carrying equipment to a U.S. Third-World client, theUNITA rebel movement in Angola, had crashed near Jamba, Angola.   The all-out offensive the Salvadoran rebels launched on Nov. 11,Baker said, ``was made possible by Soviet arms.''   President Alfredo Cristiani ``is cracking down in El Salvador inan attempt to rid the streets of these terrorist guerrillas. Idon't think that that's anything but absolutely appropriate,'' thesecretary said.   Separately, CIA Director William Webster told reporters that therebels were continuing to ``make a symbolic and important statementabout their ability to keep causing trouble'' through urban attacksbut that they posed no threat to Cristiani's government.   Since the rebel offensive began, Cristiani's security forceshave raided more than a dozen churches and refugee centers and havedetained labor officials.   Last week, six Jesuit priests were brutally murdered; witnesseshave said uniformed sldiers were seen near the killing site.   In a separate incident, seven civilians were lined up andexecuted on Nov. 18 in a poor San Salvador suburb. Witnesses sawgovernment soldiers a block away minutes before the killings.   Baker said Cristiani and his government ``understand very wellthat there must be complete respect for human rights in El Salvadorif they expect to contiue to receive United States support.''   As to the resurgence of right-wing death squad activity, whichin the past has been linked to Cristiani's conservative Arenaparty, Baker said, ``I think its important that they do everythingthey can to get control of that kind of activity.''   Baker was asked by reporters if President Bush was contemplatingany military intervention in light of the latest violence. He saidthe president ``has never ruled out any option that might benecessary to protect American lives.''   Under current congressional restraints, the United States canprovide 55 military advisers as part of its aid to the Salvadorangovernment.   The presence of an additional six Green Berets came to lightlast week when the rebels took over the Sheraton Hotel in SanSalvador, where the elite troops were staying. Fitzwater said thoseGreen Berets were not part of the 55-member contingent butwere onspecial temporary assignment in El Salvador.   Wednesday's outbreak of fighting occurred in the same affluentneighborhood.   Regarding the case of Connecticut church worker Jennifer Casolo,who was arrested by the Salvadoran government on Sunday on chargesof harboring weapons, Fitzwater said U.S. officials ``have beenmonitoring her case closely to assure she is well treated.''   Fitzwater said that during her four years in El Salvador, MissCasolo had become ``known to embassy officials through her workwith Christian education seminars and coordinating non-officialdelegations to El Salvador. ... The embassy will continue to assurethat she is given every benefit due her under Salvadoran law.''   Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash., who spoke with Miss Casolo in thepolice barracks where she is held, said in Seattle she ``maintainedher innocence.''   A group of Americans headed by former Attorney General RamseyClark planned to fly from Miami to San Salvador on Thursday to seeher and help slect a Salvadoran attorney, a spokesman for the groupsaid in Seattle.</TEXT></DOC>
