However, Amerada Hess Corp., which is primarily a refiner, posted a large loss, mainly reflecting inventory write-downs in the volatile environment of oil prices.    The gains posted by Mobil and Shell, a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group, were generally spurred by higher crude oil prices, a late-year turnaround in the refining business, record chemical earnings and continued cost-cutting.    The natural-gas market also played a prominent role in the results of both Mobil and Shell. Allen E. Murray, chairman of Mobil, cited increased sales of natural gas in the quarter. John F. Bookout, president of Shell, said that lower gas prices restrained the fourth-quarter earnings gain but noted that gas prices have been rising sharply this year.    The results were in line with Wall Street expectations. Mobil closed at $41.625, unchanged, and Amerada Hess finished at $25.50, down 50 cents, both in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.    Mobil, based in New York, said its fourth-quarter net income jumped 92%. The latest quarter included a $140 million write-down of foreign inventories. Revenue rose 25% to $15.66 billion from $12.5 billion.    The company said it reduced fourth-quarter corporate and other costs 40% to $45 million. The entire oil industry has been forced to reduce costs to react more quickly and preserve margins in an era of intense price volatility.    Mobil said profit of its Montgomery Ward unit rose to a record $82 million from $77 million a year earlier, with the improvement coming from the retailer's core merchandising business. Mobil recently said it was studying the possible sale of Montgomery Ward to a number of investors; a sale has been widely anticipated.    Houston-based Shell said net income surged 72% in the fourth quarter, with revenue increasing 30% to $5.89 billion from $4.51 billion.    The bulk of the earnings gains for both Mobil and Shell came from the increase in crude prices, which Shell said averaged $15.33 a barrel in the fourth quarter, a 32% increase from a year earlier. Shell noted, though, that prices &quot;remained substantially below&quot; levels before the collapse in early 1986.    Revenue for the year rose 22% to $21.22 billion from $17.35 billion.    For New York-based Amerada Hess, refining and marketing operations showed a net loss of $195 million in the fourth quarter, primarily reflecting the inventory write-downs. Revenue increased 38% to $1.27 billion from $923.5 million.    Revenue for 1987 rose to $4.78 billion from $4.06 billion.    ---                        1987            1986                    in       per     in       per     %                    millions share   millions share   chg.
