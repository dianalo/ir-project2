What we saw was thedeath of a few birds and there may be more,'' said Ted DeLaca, chiefof the Division of Polar Programs of the Washington-based NationalScience Foundation.   ``Some said this was an eco-catastrophe of biblical proportions.That clearly is not true. Others said it was nothing. That's nottrue, either. The truth is somewhere in between.''   Many krill, a small, shrimplike crustacean that is the main foodfor whalebone whales, washed up on islands after the Bahia Paraisoran aground on Jan. 28 and began leaking fuel oil.   The Argentine navy oceanographic vessel had been chartered for atourist excursion.   The accident took place near the U.S. polar research stationPalmer on the Antarctic peninsula, 600 miles below the tip of SouthAmerica. DeLaca was on the scene and helped organize the transfer oftourists from ship to land by motorized rubber boats.   The partially submerged ship was carrying an estimated 800 tonsof diesel oil, butane, compressed gas and other fuel, whichimmediately began to leak. How much leaked and how much will berecovered was not known, DeLaca said.   He said some penguins and cormorants died after ingesting oil orgetting it on themselves, and thousands of limpets, a small, marineanimal, also died.   However, navy experts from Argentina and Chile and scientistsaboard the foundation vessel Polar Duke quickly recovered floatingfuel canisters, patched the Bahia Paraiso's hull, stopped the leakand contained the spill and now are cleaning it up.   ``For the most part, the stuff that went into the water seems tohave dispersed and gone away,'' DeLaca, a bearded, 45-year-oldmarine microbiologist, said in an interview.   The concern now is what possible long-term effects the spill mayhave on animal and plant life and on research such as that conductedat Palmer since 1970.   ``The Antarctic is a hostile, unforgiving environment,'' DeLacasaid. ``The organisms that live there are specially adapted. Themargins for survival are narrow. ... Anything that takes away anedge, that compromises their fitness, could mean the differencebetween life and death.''   He said ingesting oil may affect the penguins' capacity to storeoxygen and thus their ability to dive deep for food. Oil on thefeathers of skuas, a large predator bird related to the seagull,could affect their ability to float or stay warm.   Lack of limpets and krill near a nesting may affect breedingpatterns and the ability of young creatures to survive, he said.   He said researchers also will wonder now whether the results theyobtain are valid, or a reflection of the oil spill.   ``This is the first significant spill in Antarctica,'' DeLacasaid. ``It was a pristine environment and experimental results weretaken as accurate indicators of the Antarctic environment. Thisspill could call into question future results.''   A team of scientists from the United States, Argentina and Chilewill arrive at Palmer Station next month to collect data beforewinter sets in.   ``When next spring comes is when the story will be told'' aboutthe damage caused by the spill, DeLaca said.   ``The environment will recover. No question about that. Thequestion is, is what comes back what was there before.''</TEXT></DOC>
