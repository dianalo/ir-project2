The Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association hasformed a fraud division to coordinate investigations byindividual cellular phone companies, including stingoperations across the country. Manufacturers of cellularnetwork equipment such as American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co.,Motorola Inc. and LM Ericsson are working on new softwarethat will allow carrier systems to verify calls before theycan pass. And they are planning designs for new networkequipment that won't be so easy for thieves to breach.</LP><TEXT>   It will take such a coordinated nationwide attack, saylawmen, to shut off the electronic thieves who now sellphones altered to provide free service, as well as othercrooks who submit fraudulent applications to obtain servicethat ends up being unbillable. Their pirate phones havebecome as indispensable as sidearms for drug traffickers andother criminals who crave mobility.   &quot;What self-respecting dope dealer wouldn't have a beeperon his hip and an {illegal} cellular phone in his pocket,&quot;says Earl Devaney, who heads the Secret Service's FraudDivision. &quot;It allows that person total anonymity.&quot;   In some of the poorest neighborhoods, including immigranthavens such as Jackson Heights here, law enforcementauthorities say some crooks are using the illegal phones in&quot;call-sell&quot; shops, where folks who don't want to pay thenormal long-distance charges can make a 15-minute callanywhere in the world for a few dollars.   To stop these shadow phone services, such carriers asMcCaw Cellular Communications Inc. have eliminated directdialing to places such as Barbados and South America -- thedestinations for many of the illegal calls. Now a customermust give a credit-card number to an operator before the callis put through.   Carriers also have tightened up on customer backgroundchecks before granting service, a move that &quot;is killing the{legitimate} business,&quot; according to Raul Ruidiaz of Randamp;RChalet Communications, a dealer in Jackson Heights, a centerof cellular fraud, say law enforcement authorities. &quot;Thecellular company gives us a hard time, wanting more{customer} I.D. because somebody else is ripping them off,&quot;Mr. Ruidiaz says.   To uncover subscription scams, undercover investigatorsare submitting fraudulent applications and phonyidentification to unscrupulous sales agents. When the agentspass them along without checking and claim commissions,cellular companies cut the agents off. In other stings,investigators indicate to agents that they want servicewithout being billed. When clerks or store owners pass theinvestigators along to suppliers of illegal phones, theinvestigators arrest the suppliers.   Local police and federal agents have also netted peopleusing the identities of legitimate cellular customers toobtain service. For 30 to 60 days, the crook's phone can makeunlimited calls without being detected because the servicebill is eventually sent to the customer whose identity wasused. &quot;These {untraceable} phones will sell on the street for$1,500 to $5,000,&quot; says Michael Guidry of Texas-basedinvestigators Guidry Associates.   The most sophisticated scam, phones that areelectronically altered to provide free calls, surfaced aboutfour years ago. That's when several California men figuredout how to re-program the special chip inside a cellularphone so it would transmit a bogus &quot;electronic serial number&quot;to the local phone switch and trick the system into lettingthe call pass. Easy-to-copy versions of this pirate programlater found their way across the country where crooks areusing them to evade phone taps and make free calls.   To counter, the Secret Service, working with severalcellular phone companies, designed a special software &quot;patch&quot;that will cut off bogus calls. But thieves &quot;find another wayno matter how high you build the wall,&quot; says Kevin McKeand,director of inter-carrier services at McCaw.   The bogus calls escaped detection because unlike theregular wired phone network, cellular phone companies have nomethod of cross-checking databases to verify a caller'slegitimacy. Cellular systems allow any phone's uniqueelectronic serial number to pass through when a call isinitially dialed. If the security computer then finds thatthe number is bogus, it will cut off subsequent calls fromthe phone. However, when a customer &quot;roams&quot; into a callingarea beyond his regular service territory, the securitysystem can't react fast enough to cut off the calls.   To overcome this problem, the cellular companies next yearplan to link their systems into a new nationwide network thatallows them to check each other's customer records before acall is allowed to pass, says John Marinho, a supervisor ofcellular standards development at ATandamp;T Bell Laboratories. Newdigital phones, which are more secure, will help, too. Still,Mr. Marinho says, the industry is trying to figure out how toshield calls from &quot;the {seven million} analog-type phonesthat are already out there.&quot;   If any of this works it should make life a little easier-- and safer -- for Mr. Guidry, who has seen his share ofshrewd cellular crooks. Not long ago, he came across a bunchof phones, each of which had a little magnet connected to aspring inside its housing. When the phone was opened themagnet would shoot along a little track, hitting andinstantly de-programming the special electronic chip thatcarries a phone's complex operating software and uniqueelectronic serial number, erasing the evidence of a crime.   Another time, Mr. Guidry says he almost got &quot;my head blownoff&quot; when one of the phones was found to be fitted withplastic explosive. &quot;They knew we'd be taking a look at theinsides,&quot; he says with a nervous giggle. However, the triggerdidn't work because the spring broke.</TEXT></DOC>
