others that reported virusattacks included Mid-Glamorgan County Council and &quot;a major internationalcompany,&quot; but big few commercial enterprises dependent on computers arelikely to publicise an attack.andM;- o -andM;The world overview of the effects of the Datacrime virus on Friday night fromDavid Frost of Price Waterhouse was that aside from the reported cases in theUK, the most significant outbreak was probably within Swiss governmentnetworks where about 35,000 personal computers went down, while a couple ofcompanies were affected in Holland: in the US, where the virus is known asColumbus Day most firms had a vaccine program, but one advertising companyhad been hit and there was a near miss at a large software producer wherecontrols stopped the virus and violated it before it could stop production ofcompilers.andM;- o -andM;Doubt that Apricot Computers Plc would recount the events in quite the sameway, but Martin Houston says that he turned from a senior systems programmerat Apricot into an entrepreneur, creating Houston Technology Ltd inBirmingham after &quot;Apricot made a sudden and rather strange managementdecision to redeploy all its Unix staff on OS/2 development: needless to say,the Unix staff were not impressed with the offer of retraining to somethinginferior to what they already knew; subsequently, this decision to back OS/2caused the resignation of three quarters of the staff within six weeks and asubsequent sharp U-turn in favour of Unix&quot;.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
