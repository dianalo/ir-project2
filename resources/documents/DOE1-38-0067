Presence of the colloid was inferred fromthe response of the copper ion-selective electrode and confirmed by lightscattering measurements. The colloid is only slowly converted to thermodynamicallymore stable species, with the result that copper-carbonate complexesare not formed to any significant extent in solutions exposed to atmosphericcarbon dioxide. However, copper-carbonate complexes are formed in solutionscontaining a constant amount of total carbonate. Speciation and complexationcapacity measurements should be interpreted with caution because thermodynamicequilibrium may not be attained in solution. 36 references, 7 figures,2 tables.</TEXT></DOC>
