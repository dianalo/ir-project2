<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-61-1049 </DOCNO><TEXT>Charged pions have been measured at 70/sup 0/ in coincidence with projectile-likefragments in /sup 12/C+/sup 12/C, /sup 12/C+/sup 116/Sn and /sup 12/C+/sup124/Sn reactions at 85A MeV. Neither the {pi}/sup +/ emission nor the{pi}/sup -//{pi}/sup +/ ratio exhibit differences for /sup 124/Sn and/sup 116/Sn targets outside those expected from the isospin difference.Inconsistencies in the target mass dependence of the pion yield disappearif a correction for reabsorption is included. After this correction,we observe a strong, {approx_equal} A/sup 1.1/, mass dependence. Theprojectile breakup is significantly stronger for pion-producing collisionsthan for the average collision indicating a much stronger abundance ofcentral collisions.</TEXT></DOC>
