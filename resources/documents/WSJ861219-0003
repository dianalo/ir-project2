De Lorean's acquittal on racketeering and fraud charges may have resulted from the jury's misunderstanding of an instruction from the judge.    The jurors' doubts about the verdict were spelled out in an official court transcript of a heated meeting among the judge, defense attorneys and the prosecutors that took place within an hour after the verdict Wednesday.    The transcript, released by the court yesterday, shows prosecutors arguing that &quot;a gross miscarriage of justice&quot; could occur and asking either that the jury return to its deliberations or be dismissed and a mistrial declared. The defense strongly disagreed, however, arguing that the jury had been &quot;contaminated&quot; by talking to the judge after the dismissal and &quot;can't possibly be put back together.&quot;    Judge Julian Abele Cook Jr. sided with the defense because, the transcript indicated, the jury had already been discharged and was no longer under the control of the court.    Based on the official transcript and on interviews with jurors, the jury apparently believed that if it couldn't unanimously find Mr. De Lorean guilty, then it had to find him innocent. However, when jurors fail to reach a unanimous verdict, they can tell the judge they are hopelessly deadlocked.    According to the court transcript, the misunderstanding came to light after Judge Cook dismissed the jurors and invited them into his chambers to &quot;thank (them) for having served.&quot; The judge is quoted in the transcript as saying that during the informal get-together, a juror &quot;in an unsolicited comment&quot; told him that the verdict wasn't unanimous, that &quot;she had misunderstood the jury instructions and thought that she could not live with herself if she did not express the viewpoint at that time.&quot; According to the transcript, Judge Cook said another juror &quot;advised the court that he had felt intimidated by the discussion among the jurors&quot; and wasn't allowed to speak &quot;despite raising his hand repeatedly.&quot;    Immediately after this, the transcript says, Judge Cook left the jurors and met with defense attorneys and prosecutors to explain the situation.    Several attorneys interviewed about the incident said it appears there was a misunderstanding about the law. But all agreed it's very doubtful the verdict will be changed. &quot;What you may have is a very lucky defense lawyer and an even luckier defendant,&quot; said Stanley S. Arkin, a prominent lawyer for white-collar defendants. &quot;In another world, the jury would have come back and said, 'We're hung,' and he would have been retried.&quot;    Judge Cook's secretary said he wouldn't have any comment about the controversy. &quot;He hasn't ever spoken to the media after any trial in the eight years he's been on the bench and he doesn't want to treat this case any differently,&quot; she said. &quot;You can refer back to the transcripts for anything he has said.&quot;    Joseph Papelian, lead prosecutor, referred questions to U.S. Attorney Roy C. Hayes. Neither Mr. Hayes nor Howard Weitzman, the lead defense attorney, could be reached for comment.    Donald Bryce, a Chrysler Corp. engineering supervisor who served as jury foreman, said in a telephone interview yesterday that almost from the start of deliberations Dec. 10, three jurors believed Mr. De Lorean should be convicted for allegedly converting to his own use more than $8.5 million raised to develop his sports car. The nine other jurors believed defense attorney arguments that Mr. De Lorean received the $8.5 million as a legal loan, Mr. Bryce said.    At one point last week, the jurors sent word to Judge Cook that they were deadlocked on the loan issue, but Judge Cook sent back a note telling them to &quot;continue to deliberate,&quot; Mr. Bryce said.    He said the instruction that most confused the jurors as they continued to deliberate was one line on a special verdict form that read, &quot;Without such unanimous agreement, you must find the defendant not guilty of count one&quot; -- a racketeering charge.    Mr. Bryce said the jurors asked the judge for a specific clarification of that one line. Judge Cook responded by telling them to reread two pages of his main instructions, Mr. Bryce said. After rereading those instructions, he said, the jurors decided their disagreement required an acquittal on the racketeering charge. Acquittal on the other charges quickly followed. &quot;If he was cleared on the first charge, which was racketeering, if (the $8.5 million) was a legitimate loan, then he was cleared on the other charges,&quot; Mr. Bryce said.    Mr. Bryce said he doesn't understand the controversy because all the jurors ultimately agreed on how they would interpret the judge's instructions even though, according to another juror, Ronald Nachtman, two still believed Mr. De Lorean was guilty and one had switched from guilty to undecided. Said Mr. Bryce in the interview: &quot;Before we sent the note to the judge that we had reached a verdict, we asked everybody in the room, 'Are you all agreed on this verdict?' and they said, 'Yes.' We said, 'Are you all satisfied?' and they said, 'Yes.' I wouldn't have sent the note otherwise.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
