(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The elusive imposter who posed as anastronaut, military officer and pro baseball player before hisarrest on fraud charges and his announced run for mayor has skippedout on warrants in two states, police said.   State police said Wednesday they believe Robert J. Hunt may bein New York City, where he reportedly appeared on a radio talk showlast week.   Hunt, 27, apparently fled as arrest warrants were issued inMassachusetts and New Hampshire.   Three weeks ago, a man who identified himself as a campaignworker for Hunt called The Associated Press and outlined Hunt'slatest campaign ploy. After having heard that Mayor George Colellahad arranged for pizzas to be delivered to some elderly residents,the caller said Hunt planned to deliver pizza to the mayor himself.   ``I will be the next mayor of Revere,'' Hunt said last monthafter announcing he would run. ``I am honest. I think the peopleare saying that if this guy can do what he did, maybe he can dosomething for this community.''   ``People like me,'' Hunt said. ``I know how to talk to people.I'll make a great politician.''   Hunt was surprisingly effective in what he called his``impersonations.'' While posing as an astronaut, Hunt sipped teawith the Lord Mayor of Dublin, signed autographs and lectured at anaviation club called the Experimental Aviation Club.   ``He was a very good speaker, he entertained us. He held usspellbound for 2{ hours,'' the Greater Boston chapter president,Lou Pascucci, said after Hunt's arrest early this year.   The son of a plumber from Everett, Hunt at one point scorchedsome kitchen tiles and told his wife at the time that they fell offthe ill-fated Challenger shuttle. In June, Hunt said he was in theprocess of divorcing his fourth wife.   ``He will show up somewhere else with a scam,'' said StatePolice Detective Andrew Palombo, who arrested Hunt lastJanuary.``He is incapable of doing anything that is not bizarre,and he is not going to get a 9-to-5 job.''   Hunt was convicted in May of fraudulent use of a credit card inrenting a private jet airplane and of swindling a Saugus family outof $4,000.   He was ordered to make regular restitution payments to hisvictims as part of his probation in East Boston and Lynn districtcourts.   Court officials and Palumbo said payments were not made, and thetwo courts issued arrest warrants.   He also failed to appear for a July 12 hearing in New Hampshireat which Rockingham County Attorney Brian Graf planned to ask ajudge to impose a three-year suspended sentence Hunt got in 1986for issuing bad checks.   A warrant for his arrest was issued there after he failed toappear.   Palombo went to the elder Hunts' home in Revere to arrest HuntJuly 12 and found that he had left.   Hunt's father, Leo Hunt, said his son had left his clothes, andhe thought he was staying with friends in New York's GreenwichVillage.</TEXT></DOC>
