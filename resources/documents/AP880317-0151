The Sandinista forces ``are not withdrawing at all,'' AssistantSecretary of State Elliott Abrams told reporters after a closedCapitol Hill briefing.   Members of Congress in attendance said administration officialshad also painted a picture of more than 1,000 rebels hemmed in at abase just inside Nicaragua.   A Pentagon source said the Sandinistas continued to pound theContras inside Honduras as well. The source, requesting anonymity,said that ``the Contra camps are under intense pressure.''   From Managua, a Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry spokesman said againtoday that his nation's troops had not crossed the border andcalled on the United Nations and the Organization of AmericanStates to ``establish what the facts are.''   And Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega, while not confirmingthat his troops had invaded Honduras, told a news conference thathe would not withdraw his forces stationed near the border untilthe U.S. forces left Honduras.   However, both the Democratic chairman and the Republican vicechairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee said after a briefingthat Reagan had little choice but to agree to Honduran PresidentJose Azcona's request for help.   The senators, Democrat David Boren of Oklahoma and RepublicanWilliam Cohen of Maine, also agreed that the Nicaraguan move was anstaged incursion, not a hot pursuit of fleeing Contras.   Another lawmaker who was briefed, Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill., saidthat ``there has clearly been a penetration'' by Sandinista troops``in fair numbers'' into Honduras.   Other Democrats said President Reagan was ``unjustified'' in hisaction, had been guilty of ``overreaction'' and called the reportsof an invasion of Honduras ``ridiculous.''   The American deployment, of 3,200 troops more than 100 milesfrom the fighting, was the most dramatic show of U.S. force in thesix-year Nicaraguan war.   In Managua, a Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry spokesman said againtoday that his nation's troops had not crossed the border andcalled on the United Nations and the Organization of AmericanStates to ``establish what the facts are.''   The American forces _ about 2,000 troops in two battalions fromthe 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, N.C. _ began arrivingshortly after 11 a.m. EST at Palmerola Air Base, about 125 milesfrom the reported hostilities, after a three-hour flight. They werebeing joined later in the day by two battalions from the 7thInfantry Divisions at Fort Ord, Calif.   The 2,000 men from the 82nd Airborne were ``excited,'' said Lt.Gen. John W. Foss, adding, ``but I would not say they werenervous.''   Most of the men, being ferried on a total of 55 transport planesleaving at 30-minute intervals, were flying directly to Palmerola,but about 800 would parachute into Honduran territory about 5 milesaway and then move toward Palmerola, said the commander of the 82ndAirborne, Maj. Gen. Carl Stiner.   Accompanying the 82nd Airborne troops was a giant C-5 transportloaded with three light observation helicopters, four Cobrahelicopter gunships, one Blackhawk helicopter, a command vehicleand ammunition.   Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry spokesman Alejandro Bendana,interviewed from Managua on the NBC-TV ``Today'' show, saidNicaraguan forces battling the U.S.-backed Contras had reached theborder with Honduras.   ``There's been a cross fire and there's been fighting alongsidethe border,'' he said, adding that ``the operations havesuccessfully been concluded and we don't plan to stay in the borderregion.''   Bendana said Nicaragua would fly reporters to the area later inthe day. In addition, he said, ``We've called for an OAS-UN missionto go to the site and let them establish what the facts are.''   ``They can go and see for themselves,'' he said. ``Don't takeour word for it.''   But Secretary of State George P. Shultz, appearing before theSenate Budget Committee, laid out this scenario:   _Intelligence efforts detected preparations for a Nicaraguandrive March 9. First contact between the Sandinistas and Contrasinside Honduras came the next day.   _On Tuesday, the Contras reported heavy fighting and attacksfrom Nicaraguan bombers inside Honduras.   _On Wednesday, ``we saw a presence of 1,600 to 2,000 Sandinistatroops'' in Honduras. Aiding the Nicaraguan ground forces werebombers and heavily armed helicopters, he said.   Shultz laid part of the responsibility for the Contras' direstraits on the House, which last month voted not to renew aid tothe rebels.   ``The decision ... to deny aid to the resistance has dealt themand, in my opinion, the cause of freedom, a very serious blow,'' hesaid.   But the drumbeat of Democratic opposition continued.   House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas said, ``I know of nothing thatjustifies sending troops'' to Honduras.   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., called the U.S. move ``anoverreacton,'' adding, ``I think the notion that there's a realinvasion is just ridiculous.   ``I think it's a move the president may come to regret becausethe spectacle of American troops moving into Central America inconvoy, flying down there, I think is going to remind the Americanpeople of why they don't want this.''   ``It's an overreaction,'' said Senate Majority Leader RobertByrd, D-W.Va. ``We've heard the administration cry, `wolf, wolf,'before. I don't know when they're crying wolf.''   Some members of Congress noted that the deployment came as theadministration was making a renewed push for aid for the Contras.   But Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., interviewed on ``CBS ThisMorning,'' said he doubted the events would not change lawmakers'positions.   `We're very evenly divided in the House and in the Congress onaid, and I don't see that fundamentally changing,'' he said.   Shultz said the United States had dispatched its troops in part``to get people's attention to what is happening in CentralAmerica'' and to say to the Honduran government, ```We are yourfriends. We stand with you.'''   He also told the committee, ``It's important that people knowthe United States will fight.'' But he added that the troops ``arenot there in a shooting capacity. We haven't been asked for that.''   Some congressional leaders had been briefed by telephone lateWednesday, but Byrd said today he was still waiting for hardadministration evidence to back up its statements on the Nicaraguantroop movements.   U.S. aid to the Contras ran out two weeks ago, and theadministration is hoping the new situation will earn the Contrasgreater sympathy in Congress.   Fitzwater said the U.S. deployment came in response to a requestfrom Azcona. He said Reagan was briefed on the request about 8 p.m.EST in his residence and decided to send in U.S. forces.</TEXT></DOC>
