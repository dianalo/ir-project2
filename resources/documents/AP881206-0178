But Joe Fernandez, Dade's school superintendent, says he doesn'tcare what the NRA thinks.   ``If it was in my power, we'd outlaw guns completely,'' Fernandezsaid.   The $25,000 ``Guns Kill _ Say NO to Guns'' program, drawn up inreaction to the unprecedented number of Dade children killed by gunsthis year, will begin Friday, only days after a junior at MiamiPalmetto High School died of gunshot wounds.   Sixteen-year-old Lowell Thomas Jr. was gunned down by someone ina car outside his family's apartment Sunday night, according toMetro police. Investigators say they have identified two suspects, aPalmetto High dropout and a current student at the school.   Beginning Friday, Dade County school children are to beinstructed that the best way to handle a gun is to not pick it up inthe first place.   School officials hope the message of their unprecedented GunSafety Awareness program will help prevent accidental deaths, if notdeliberate killings.   ``I'm not sure if the gun safety awareness program is geared tocope with premeditated murder,'' said School Board member JanetMcAliley. ``This program should help to prevent accidental deathssuch as when a child picks up a gun that may or not be loaded.''   Fernandez agreed.   ``We are not focused on those who have criminal intent. I'm notsure what we could do about that,'' Fernandez said. ``We're focusedon kids who wind up playing with guns, either they don't knowthey're loaded or they play Russian roulette.''   But Hammer argued the schools are taking the wrong approach.   Hammer said she knows there is a lot of anguish after a handgunslaying _ especially when the victim is a teen-ager _ but sheinsists that ``you can't teach by scaring someone to death.''   Hammer added: ``If `Just Say No' campaigns worked, our drugproblem wouldn't exist anymore.''   The new program, expected to be formally approved at Wednesday'sboard meeting, starts with principals reading a prepared text duringthe morning announcements, followed by a discussion between studentsand teachers at the elementary and middle-school level.   Phased in throughout the year will be parent workshops, publicservice announcements and, for older students, a video detailing theconsequences of getting shot _ and the agonizing recovery period.   The NRA had proposed teaching gun safety classes, but the schoolsrejected the idea.   A proposal by the NRA this fall to distribute its gun safetycoloring book in Chicago schools is still being considered by theBoard of Education there, school board spokesman Bob Saigh saidTuesday.</TEXT></DOC>
