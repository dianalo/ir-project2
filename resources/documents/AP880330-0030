In addition, Jackson lost the support of blue-collar whiteworkers in Connecticut to Michael Dukakis, the polls by ABC Newsand WNBC-TV said.   ``Jackson has improved his showing with whites, but not theworking class whites he's supposedly been getting,'' said ABC pollanalyst John Brennan. ``Those have been won decisively by MikeDukakis.''   Signs of Jackson's weakness in a fall campaign were also evidentin the survey findings. Thirty-three percent of Democrats told ABCthey would abandon the party and vote for George Bush if Jacksonwere nominated, compared with 13 percent if Dukakis were thenominee and 24 percent if Gore received the nomination.   That third of the Democrats who'd vote for Bush if Jackson werenominated include a plurality _ 45 percent _ of the Democrats whovoted for Dukakis.   Sixty percent of the Democrats, including a third of those whovoted for Jackson, said they believe Dukakis will be the nominee,WNBC found. Only 20 percent said they think the country is ready toelect a black president.   Dukakis won all demographic groups except blacks, and ABC foundthat 79 percent of Democrats said they would support him againstBush in November. Just 56 percent said they would support Sen.Albert Gore Jr. against Bush and only 52 percent of Democrats saidthey would back Jackson against Bush.   Still, the WNBC poll found some softness in Dukakis' support: 45percent of his voters said they wished there were other candidatesrunning.   ``He's swept all groups except blacks,'' said poll chief LaurilyEpstein. ``But there's disquieting news in that it's notenthusiastic support.''   ABC found that Jackson did not draw a much greater share ofblack voters to the process; their 8 percent of the total was upjust 1 point from 1984. And Jackson's white supporters wereprimarily well-educated liberals; Dukakis, governor of neighboringMassachusetts, won blue-collar workers by a 2-to-1 margin.   ``He (Jackson) is increasing his white vote,'' Brennan said.``But given the profile of his white vote it's doubtful at thispoint that he is competitive.''   Brennan noted that Jackson's share of the white vote was aboutthe same in Massachusetts and Rhode Island and greater in Vermontearly this month, before his victory Saturday in the Michigancaucuses. The WNBC poll found no evidence of movement to Jacksonafter his Michigan victory.   ``There's been a misconception that Jackson has made some kindof substantial breakthrough with the white vote,'' Brennan said.``I don't think that's happened.'' There was no exit polling in theMichigan caucuses, which, as is customary for caucuses, drewrelatively few voters.   There also was a hint of potential trouble for Bush in thegeneral election: The 40 percent of Republicans who said he not hastold the full story of the Iran-Contra affair tended to support himless strongly. ``Among those for whom it's an issue, it's hurtinghim,'' Epstein said.   Bush still was viewed favorably by 75 percent of the Republicanvoters, and unfavorably by 18 percent, in WBNC's poll. Dukakis wasviewed favorably by 70 percent of Democrats and unfavorably by 10percent.   Jackson was viewed favorably by about half Democrats andunfavorably by a third, while Gore's rating was 40 percentfavorable, a quarter unfavorable. Only one in seven Gore supportersthink he will be the party's nominee.   The WNBC poll included 1,700 voters and had a margin of samplingerror of 3 points. ABC's poll had 1,277 voters and a 5-point errormargin.</TEXT></DOC>
