This has led many states to introduce higherincome- and sales-tax rates, which damaged their owneconomies and placed a significant drag on the nationaleconomy as well.   The states' choice is part of a downward spiral. States'self-inflicted damage reduces federal tax receipts. Weakfederal receipts then increase the threat of higher federalrates, hurting the economy and in turn weakening statereceipts. States then raise taxes, and the cycle continues.</LP><TEXT>   One particular federal tax has had an especially harshimpact on state tax receipts: the 33% maximum marginal taxrate on capital gains enacted in 1986. Raising the maximummarginal rate on capital gains to 33% from 20% stopped thenatural growth of taxable state income from this source.States in which capital gains had previously been animportant source of taxable state income are finding weak taxreceipts, perhaps without understanding the reason.   The chart shows realized capital gains (net after losses)for the five states that account for nearly half the capitalgains in the entire nation (see accompanying chart -- WSJSep. 14, 1990). Florida and Texas have no income tax, whichis one reason that many people who have accumulatedsubstantial assets live there. New York, California andIllinois have long depended heavily on capital gains taxes.So have New Jersey, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania andConnecticut.   Until recently, evidence that a high federal capital gainsrate has hurt state collections might have been deemedambiguous. People rushed to realize gains in 1986 because thetax rate was about to rise to 28% the following year. Itmight be argued too that in 1987 capital gains were weakbecause of the October stock market crash, though there wereplenty of gains in the year's first eight months.   In any case, the ambiguity ended when the Internal RevenueService released its 1988 estimates this spring. For all fivestates in the chart, the amount of capital gains reported wasless than half of what it had been in 1986, the last year of20% tax rates, and well below the level of 1985 (about 5%lower, on average). This decline in taxable state income fromcapital gains over three years occurred despite thenationwide increase of more than 22% in personal income inthat same period.   For the federal government, the weakness in realizationssince 1986 has been at least partly offset by a much higheraverage tax rate on a small volume of capital gains. Themaximum federal capital gains tax was increased to 45% in1975 from 27% in 1968. Yet so few of the affectedhigh-bracket taxpayers actually realized gains at thepunitive rates of 1975 that the average capital-gains tax (onboth excluded and taxable gains) remained exactly the same in1975 as it had been in 1968: 15%. The 1985 reduction of thehighest capital gains tax to 20% percent so encouragedefficient turnover of assets among higher-income taxpayersthat the average tax paid remained exactly what it had beenin the high-tax 1970s: 15%.   In 1988, by contrast, the capital gains tax on thehighest-income taxpayers rose to 28% percent, but the averagetax rate rose to 24%. It is doubtful if there has ever been atime in U.S. history when so many taxpayers faced tax ratesabove 20% on the uncertain rewards from life savings.   States in which capital gains were a particularlyimportant source of taxable income expected this source ofincome to grow between 1985 and 1988. After all, the DowJones average at the end of 1988 was 62% higher than it hadbeen in 1985. But the states were mugged by the federal taxlaw of 1986. By imposing a 28-33% tax -- even on the inflatedcapital gains of couples with rather modest incomes -- thefederal government made it extremely expensive for nearly alltaxpayers to realize any capital gains, particularly instates that added their own tax on top of the federal levy,where the combined capital gains burden could reach 39%.Taxpayers responded by avoiding the sale of assets (exceptunder financial distress), and by making sure that theirfuture investments were not subject to combined capital-gainstaxes -- they invested in money-market funds instead ofgrowth stocks. Tax receipts collapsed in states mostdependent on capital gains -- including much of thenortheast.   But this is not the only adverse effect of high federalcapital-gains taxes on state revenues. The increased federaltax rate on capital gains also provides a greater incentiveto locate small businesses in states with little or no incometax, because of the brutal combination of federal and statecapital-gains tax on those who sell their businesses. Loss ofdeductibility for state income taxes would greatly aggravatethis effect for small businesses remaining in states like NewJersey, New York and California. For taxpayers in a 33%federal bracket and an 8% state bracket, for example, thecombined marginal tax on capital gains would rise to 41% fromthe current 38%. Even fewer capital gains would then becashed in states with high income-tax rates.   Governors of several states most injured by the federaltax on capital gains are widely considered to be &quot;liberal&quot;Democrats who are supposed to favor high federal tax rates oncapital gains out of ideological habit. Yet the evidence isnow clear that this federal tax clearly damages their ownstate treasuries, even aside from its damaging effects on theeconomic growth and on the value of real estate and otherassets. State governors properly complain about the manyother ways in which the federal government attempts topreempt the states' tax bases -- by limiting thedeductibility of state income taxes or imposing higherfederal excise taxes. Since taxpayers do not have infinitelydeep pockets, the more the federal government takes, the lessis left for the states. Yet in the case of capital gains,governors of the states most seriously injured appear willingto impose draconian state tax rates on their citizens ratherthan lobby for relief from this counterproductive federaltax.   ---   Mr. Reynolds is a research fellow at the Hudson Institutein Indianapolis.</TEXT></DOC>
