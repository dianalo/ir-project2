At least 44 people werereported killed.   The border police and Karen sources said the dead included 42government soldiers. They said only two rebels were killed and onewas wounded.   The attack was the heaviest and most sustained since Burmesetroops began their assault on the Karen base of Kaw Moo Ra in May,the police said, speaking on condition of anonymity.   Burmese troops began pounding the base with mortar fire Saturdaybefore launching the infantry assault, police said. They pulledback Sunday after taking heavy casualties, they said.   Police said the camp, about five miles from the Thai border townof Mae Sot, is defended by about 1,200 Karens. There was noindication how many Burmese troops were involved in the attack.   The Karens, with about 8,000 fighters, are the largest of 12ethnic minority groups that have fought a four-decade war forgreater autonomy from the central government.   Kaw Moo Ra, situated along a curve of the Moei River, can beattacked from Burma only with artillery or by a frontal assault ona well-defended 250-yard strip of land between the two bends in theriver.   Thai gunners fired 15 warning shots at a Burmese governmentmortar base in hills near the camp after about 80 mortar roundsfell inside Thai territory at the village of Ban Wang Kaew, policesaid.   Burmese troops burned the Thai village at the end of May, whenthey intruded into Thailand to attack Kaw Moo Ra from the rear.   Last year, the Burmese army began a campaign to dislodge theKarens from riverbank strongholds where they have controlledcross-border trade. Burmese troops have seized five key bases sinceDecember.   The Burmese government wants to clear routes throughKaren-controlled territory to allow the passage of export goods,mainly timber, into Thailand.   The Karens say the government has paid a heavy price for itsvictories. They claim to have killed at least 2,000 governmentsoldiers and wounded 4,000. They gave no total for their owncasualties.   Thai border forces said earlier in the campaign that Karencasualties were much lighter than those of the government.</TEXT></DOC>
