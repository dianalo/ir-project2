The Milwaukee-based maker of mining and mineral-processing equipment, which plans to keep operating while it reorganizes, said creditors and others failed to approve the plan as fast as it hoped. &quot;There were a cascade of problems,&quot; one lender said.    It was yet another defeat for a once-mighty industrial company. In its heyday, Allis was one of the country's largest farm-equipment makers, with sales as recently as 1981 of more than $2 billion. In recent years, as the farm-equipment and mining businesses plummeted, the company sold its farm business and began an elaborate restructuring. The company posted losses every year since 1981 and, by 1986, sales had fallen to $771.2 million.    If and when Allis completes the current planned restructuring, the company will make only air-filtration products. That business had pre-tax profit from continuing operations of about $17 million on sales of $285 million in 1985.    In the filing, the company said it had assets of $545.6 million and liabilities of $533.7 million. Of its debt, $191.9 million was listed as secured.    The company said its international operations wouldn't be affected by the filing. But it will now need court approval to proceed with the sale of its group of foreign subsidiaries to Boliden AB, a unit of Trelleborg AB of Sweden, for about $90 million.    The remainder of the restructuring plan, which was announced in early March, included the sale of all businesses except for American Air Filter Co., a public offering of debt securities, and elimination of its $200 million debt. As previously reported, bank and institutional lenders were to be repaid, in part, from the proceeds of the sales and the public offering. Also, about $60 million of debt would be swapped for 40% of the company's common stock.    In addition to lenders, the company also has been negotiating with its unions and the federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp.    Allis was asking the United Auto Workers to substantially reduce health benefits. Allis's payments for such benefits totaled $22 million in 1986, according to the filing. A UAW official said the company had given the union &quot;every indication&quot; that it was not the stumbling block to the restructuring plan.    Allis had asked the federal pension agency to forgo some obligations from Allis in exchange for a small stake in the company. A spokeswoman for the agency said it favored the restructuring proposal &quot;as long as we were treated the same as other creditors.&quot; A lender close to the negotiations said the restructuring never came to a vote.    Allis's largest unsecured creditors include KHIC America Corp., which is owed $663,950; Farrish Gravel Co., North Mississippi Asphalt Co., J.G. Grading Contractors Inc. and Hartford Accident andamp; Indemnity Co., which are jointly owed $600,000; and Manville Corp., which is owed $471,157.    Though Allis-Chalmers is based in West Allis, Wis., near Milwaukee, the company's bankruptcy-law proceedings will be handled in Manhattan by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland, who has been handling, among others, two of the biggest bankruptcy-law cases in U.S. history -- those of Dallas-based LTV Corp. and Denver-based Manville. In all three of these cases the filing companies -- each of them represented by the New York law firms of Levin andamp; Weintraub andamp; Crames, and Davis Polk andamp; Wardwell -- have chosen to litigate their cases in Manhattan rather than in courts near their headquarters.    Like the LTV and Manville cases, Judge Lifland, who is chief judge of the Manhattan bankruptcy court, was assigned the Allis-Chalmers case through a random-selection system that divides cases among Judge Lifland and four other judges.    As a result of yesterday's filing, Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. lowered Allis's ratings on $5.9 million of 6.1% sinking fund debentures to single-D from single-B-minus, and ratings on $90 million of $5.875 cumulative convertible preferred stock, series C, to single-D from single-C. Moody's Investors Service Inc. lowered the rating on Allis-Chalmers sinking fund debentures from B3 to Ca and the rating on the company's Series C preferred stock from Caa to Ca.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Allis-Chalmers shares fell 75 cents to close at $2.125. </TEXT></DOC>
