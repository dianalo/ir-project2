 No confusion, no pain.andP;  One point of IS contact for the user.andM;Present: The bills arrive throughout the month.andP;  Separate ones for hardware,systems software, applications software, consulting, maintenance.andP;  Manyvendors to deal with, contracts to keep track of.andP;  Can't someone bring orderto all this chaos?andM;Enter: IBM.andP;  The largest IS supplier in the world has heard your call.andO;Having developed or acquired products to fill most IS needs, IBM is combiningthese products with various value-added services that span everything fromsoftware code to network management.andP;  Need a systems design or networkoperations team?andP;  Want a manufacturing specialist to outline a CIM strategy?andO;All are just a call away.andP;  Dial 1-800-BIG BLUE, the Information Utility.andP;  . andM;.  .IBM is trying to achieve an all-encompassing relationship with its existingcustomers and bring newer, younger businesses into the fold.andP;  Its traditionalcustomers, the large corporations, have grown tired of controlling theirhardware architecture in an effort to enforce software consistency.andP;  Many arestuck fast in a web of technical complexity and machine-dependent programs,and want to be released.andP;  These corporations want their business decisions tobe based on the applications interface they see, not on the underlyinghardware architecture, as before.andP;  And at the opposite end of the spectrum,young companies--those that are starting with a clean systems slate--wanttheir applications to be a reflection of their businesses, not of theircomputers.andM;To both classes of business, established and new, IBM is offering a trade.andO;It will provide them with the high-level business interfaces they seek inexchange for being given the role of technical manager and businessconsultant/integrator.andP;  IBM will withhold the proprietary technicalinformation that has been the customer's lifeblood in the past--the so-calledsource code--and replace it with a vanilla version that is impossible tomodify.andP;  This is the essence of Big Blue's Object Code Only (OCO) policy.andM;IBM says that OCO is a necessary prerequisite to the steady stream ofprogrammerless machines, self-regulating network components, andsuperintelligent software that it intends to supply.andP;  Such technology, IBMclaims, will not only reduce the complexity of a customer's IS environment,but will shrink its labor force as well.andM;The Risk of Dependence on IBMandM;The price for such freedom--a price IBM doesn't talk about--is a growingdependence on the giant not only as a technology partner but also as abusiness partner.andP;  As the definer of business interfaces--most prominentlySystems Application Architecture (SAA)--IBM is trying to position itself asthe natural choice for manager of the integrated computing environment, evenin a multivendor environment.andP;  But this desire, coupled with bundledone-stop, one-shop services, adds up to more than just systems integration.andO;It's the design, specification, implementation, maintenance, and ongoingmanagement of a company's IS resources.andP;  Just plug in, and IBM will take careof the rest.andP;  In a sense, what IBM is trying to do is become the high-techequivalent of a functional utility for business.andP;  Not the legal or monolithicutility associated historically with natural gas and electricity, but aninfrastructure for our information economy, an Information Utility.andM;The technological building blocks of this information utility are SAA, keysystems software, standards, and programmerless hardware.andP;  The deliverymechanisms are IBM's own sales force backed up by thousands of IBM businesspartners: the value-added resellers and independent software vendors thatextend IBM's reach in a world where 80% of the company's personal computersand 60% of its midrange systems are sold and supported indirectly.andM;To put together this all-encompassing IS provider, the key building blocksare:andM;* SAA's &quot;standard&quot; interfaces: Common User Access (CUA), the interface thatcontrols how the system, including applications, interacts with a person at aterminal or workstation; Common Programming Interface (CPI), which allowsapplications to be independent of the underlying system; and CommonCommunications Support (CCS), which standardizes network connections.andO;Through CCS, and especially its LU 6.2 peer-to-peer protocol, IBM can supportUnix interfaces stretching from the desktop to the data center.andP;  Look forsweeping Unix announcements throughout the year.andP;  IBM executives claim thatthe company has poured billions of dollars into SAA since 1985, and regard itas the single most important project ever undertaken by the company.andP;  Manycustomers have referred to SAA as a &quot;blueprint for bundling.&quot;andP;  IBM calls SAAthe &quot;mortar.&quot;andM;* Associated systems software--operating systems, subsystems, a DBMS, and adata repository.andP;  The latter, a giant data resources manager, is expected tobe unveiled late this year.andP;  The systems software is becoming increasinglyintelligent, or expert, and is taking over functions that were formerlyhandled by the IS department.andP;  Once, systems software came with the machineat no charge.andP;  Today, it provides the recurring revenue stream that IBM lostwhen it moved away from hardware rentals.andP;  Systems software must manage thewhole organization's computing environment: it supplies the power; thehardware supplies the plugs.andM;* Programmerless machines--the plugs.andP;  Midrange systems such as the 9370 willalready run unattended.andP;  IBM is working toward a &quot;lights out&quot; mainframeenvironment for the late 1990s, according to customers and IBM itself.andO;SAA-compliant boxes from the likes of Digital Equipment Corp., Amdahl Corp.,andO;and the Japanese are also plugs.andP;  &quot;If they further the cause of SAA,&quot; saidGeorge Conrades, senior vp and head of IBM's worldwide marketing andservices, in an interview with DATAMATION, &quot;these vendors must be viewed asIBM business partners.&quot;andP;  By that, he means that IBM can always replace suchplugs with its own versions down the road.andP;  IBM now refers to its mainframesas &quot;superservers,&quot; its midrange--including high-end PS/2 and RT-classworkstations--as &quot;servers,&quot; and the rest as &quot;nodes.&quot;andP;  Having defined SAA asthe mortar, IBM refers to such boxes as &quot;the bricks.&quot;andM;* Expert system-based network management.andP;  NetView already brings voice anddata under one central point of control.andP;  It is also evolving as an automatedmainframe console manager that suppresses unnecessary messages at the sourceand automates mainframe tasks.andP;  Network Equipment Technologies' IDNX T1multiplexor/Switch automatically detects failing components and faultycircuits and switches traffic to alternate routes (IBM is a var for thisproduct).andM;Bundled applications, services, and support.andP;  This is perhaps the mostcontroversial aspect of the utility idea.andP;  New applications and solutionsfrom IBM and its partners are tied into the giant's SAA, systems software,and hardware to create a one-stop shop of bundled services.andP;  IBM is revertingto its old-style method (abandoned in 1969) of using bundling as a marketingand pricing tool.andP;  There is also a new style of bundling practice, epitomizedby its AS/400 midrange computer.andP;  Vertical industry solutions and built-inDBMS and communications management software come with the machine, in acanned form.andP;  Such closed architectures provide a fascinating contrast to theso-called open world of Unix.andP;  Conrades refers to the letter form of bundlingas &quot;proprietary added value&quot; and says that customers are happy to submit toit because, as an IBM-controlled standard, it provides them with predictablegrowth in an uncertain world.andM;These, then, are the building blocks.andP;  Woven over everything are theubiquitous levels of service, support, and hand-holding.andP;  The customer canuse such an infrastructure to create its own data utility andapplications--its own &quot;house,&quot; in IBM parlance.andP;  Or, as IBM prefers, thecustomer can rely on IBM and its partners to create such solutions, which ismore a case of IBM building its own house.andP;  Either way, IBM wins.andM;IBM stops short of referring to itself as a functional utility, preferringinstead to portray itself as a builder and its partners as subcontractors.andO;&quot;IBM,&quot; says Conrades, who has been mentioned as a possible successor to JohnAkers in the mid-1990s, &quot;aspires to be the industry's ultimate consultant.&quot;andO;As a result, the giant is downplaying the control of the market that is soapparent to customers and competitors in SAA and its bundling approach.andP;  &quot;Theword 'utility' sounds closed, inward-looking--as if we're running something,&quot;says Conrades.andP;  &quot;WE want people to feel that we're going out to them withtools, techniques, and an architecture on which they can build theirhouse--not ours.andP;  Some people,&quot; he adds, pursuing the analogy, &quot;like EnglishTudor, others French Normandy.andP;  We just want to say yes.&quot;andM;This whole message--now encapsulated by Conrades in one word, okyakusama, theJapanese word for customer, which, literally translated, means &quot;honoredguest&quot; or &quot;you before me&quot;--would play a lot better, say customers, if IBMweren't so intent on bundling.andP;  &quot;But because businesses want 'lights out'data centers, reduced labor costs, OCO, and so on, they'll play along withIBM,&quot; predicts Ronald T. Brzezinski, vp of information systems at Quaker OatsCo., Chicago.andP;  &quot;They'll permit IBM to turn itself into a giantfacilities-management-based utility because these businesses want to get outfrom under all of the technical constraints.&quot;andM;Des Lee, manager of systems and communications at Lloyds of London and formerhead of the U.K.'s IBM Computer Users Association has a similar view.andP;  &quot;Therehas been a major strategic shift, in my view, toward a focus on managednetwork services as the future direction of the company,&quot; says Lee.andP;  &quot;Manythings over the past year back this [managed network services] strategy up.andO;For example, the support of international standards, without which they couldnot run those network services effectively, and the launch of the AS/400,which is the ideal machine for interfacing with those networks.andP;  Theinformation utility is definitely where they are heading.andP;  I would go so faras to say that un 10 years' time, you will see IBM not just as an informationsystems vendor, but also as an information provider.&quot;andM;Some true-blue shops such as Fireman's Fund Insurance Co., San Rafael,Calif., claim that they have been battling for many years to separate theirbusiness applications from the underlying data structures and systems.andP;  &quot;SAAis a godsend,&quot; says systems manager Renee Buckhanan, &quot;because we were alreadybeing forced to write such strategic business interfaces ourself, at greatcost in manpower and dollars.&quot;andP;  Fireman's Fund is an all-blue site that istotally committed to SAA.andP;  Other, more typical IBM accounts, those that aremultivendor in orientation, will pick and choose their strategic interfacesfrom within SAA, Unix, and to a lesser extent from DEC, such customersexplain.andM;How SAA-Based Machines Will Be DifferentandM;Perhaps the greatest potential benefit from SAA, as users see it, comes fromwhat one leading mainframe analyst refers to as IBM's strategy of&quot;functionally obsoleting&quot; its entire hardware and systems software productline under cover of the standards framework.andP;  &quot;Once IBM customers havecommitted to SAA and are developing new applications to the standard, IBM canbegin to engineer major changes in its hardware under this umbrella.andP;  NewSAA-based machines will be radically different from those we see today,&quot; saysJoseph Payne of Alex Brown andamp; Co.andM;Sources at SAA-based sites reveal that IBM is committed to several things:replacing such hierarchical workhorses as the IMS DBMS, CICS, and DISOSS witha relational DBMS based on DB2 and OS/2 Extended Edition; a transactionmonitor that better handles objects other than data; and a better combinedoffice automation/message offering.andM;Some customers even expect IBM to use SAA to replace its immensely complexMVS operating system with an enhanced version of VM acting as a hugehypervisor in a large multiprocessor S/370 environment.andP;  In addition, theyanticipate that the current 370 itself may give way to a new architecturebased on large single-level expanded storage at 48-bit addressing.andP;  Thescenario runs like this: A 48-bit addressing &quot;G&quot; Series with 13.5nsec clocktime should be announced late this year or next.andP;  The first &quot;Summit&quot; modelswith a 10nsec clock time should appear in 1991.andP;  By 1995, IBM should be readyto make the big break from 370 with what one analyst, Brian Jeffery atInternational Techonology Group, Palo Alto, calls the &quot;A&quot; (for Advanced)Series: a 64-bit addressing mainframe based on gallium arsenide circuitry.andM;The expansion of addressing capability will provide the necessarytechnological base for a new class of front-office applications using voice,image, and expert knowledge.andM;When quizzed, James Cannavino, president of IBM's Data Systems Div.andP;  and theman given the management mission of making the most of the above come true,smiles, nods sagely, and says only this: &quot;Let's just say that the 1990s willbe the decade of the superserver [mainframe].andP;  I'm convinced of that.&quot;andM;IBM has already taken the first step toward functionally obsoleting parts ofits mainframe product line (that is, everything below the 309X model E) withits spring 1988 announcement of the new ESA/370 operating system, theplatform for a new wave of relational DBMS-based applications for voice andimage as well as text.andP;  If companies want to automate front-office and realbusiness functions, they'll have to move to SAA DB2, and ESA/370, IBM warns.andM;Many nontechnical managers look forward to the time when the data centerbecomes a &quot;lights-out&quot; environment peopled by little more thanself-regulating machines, and networks become increasingly expert at siftinggood data from bad.andP;  This process, the absoprtion by the IBM computer oflabor-intensive programming functions, has already begun--or rather, itbegan, as IBM's Cannavino notes, &quot;in the 1950s with our first mainframe, andhas been refined ever since.&quot;andP;  Midrange and entry-level systems are alreadyoffered as &quot;operatorless&quot; configurations, and progress to this end is beingmade at the high end.andM;IBM's greatest attainment in this regard, as Payne of Alex Brown explains,came last spring as part of the giant's ESA/370 announcement.andP;  Through whatIBM calls Systems Managed Resource (SMR), the memory (storage) hierarchy cannow be managed automatically.andP;  Variants of the SMR technology are nowavailable simultaneously at IBM's midrange and low end, Payne points out.andO;&quot;SMR was introduced as Single Level Store for the AS/400 midrange computer inJune 1988.andP;  It was unveiled on the RISC micro via the RT at an even earlierdate in 1986.andP;  And SMR is undoubtedly an aspect of OS/2 Extended Edition tobe phased into the microcomputer market this year,&quot; he says, adding thatthrough such moves IBM has greatly increased its ability to functionallyobsolete its hardware base simultaneously rather than in a staggered way.andM;&quot;OCO is one trade-off.andP;  This is another,&quot; says Mike Armstrong, director ofresearch and systems support for Ryder System Inc. in Miami, about thebundled SAA approach.andP;  &quot;If all of SAA were here now and we could rewrite someold back-office applications as well as create new ones for the front office,we'd whip out those old mainframes so fast that you wouldn't see them fordust!&quot;andM;IBM's Efforts To Improve Its MarketingandM;Although IBM's drive to become a pervasive information utility depends inpart on its efforts to develop a consistent, comprehensive, highly automatedproduct architecture, there are other battles that the company must fight.andM;Th eindustry's premier seller of data processing products is also takingconcrete steps to recast itself as a marketing company, one that understandsits customers' business problems and is willing and able to do whatever ittakes to solve those problems.andP;  &quot;In a broad sense, we want to see to it thatthere's an IBM solution available for every user problem,&quot; says Gerald W.andO;Ebker, president of IBM's Systems Integration Div.andM;Of course, IBM has always taken a full-service approach to its largesttraditional customers, the ones who have remained the truest blue.andP;  Thedifference is that now IBM wants to provide a practically unlimited set ofvalue-added, solution-oriented services to any and all users willing to payfor them.andP;  That means business units as well as MIS.andP;  And that means userswho rely on IS equipment from a number of vendors, not just IBM.andP;  The new IBMsays that it is willing to accept that mixed-architecture, multivendorreality, and to help users manage it, calling on any number of specialistsinside or outside of IBM.andP;  One call, IBM might say, does it all.andM;That's a big change.andP;  In recent years, the push at IBM was to unbundleproducts and services and to become the low-cost provider.andP;  Hardwareproduction was automated, and service costs and prices were driven down.andO;Under programs like IBM's Corporate Service Amendment and Midrange SystemsAmendment, much of the responsibility for service and maintenance was shiftedback to the user.andM;&quot;But since late 1986, IBM has gone through a series of 180-degree turns,&quot;says H.W.andP;  &quot;Buddy&quot; Stigler, a 39-year IBM veteran who left the company lastyear to become manager of customer service for Input, a Mountain View,Calif.-based market research firm.andP;  &quot;IBM has gone from pushing to drive theprices it charges for service as low as they would go, to being willing to doanything and everything it can to help its customers on a fee service basis.andO;IBM is finally realizing tht there are so many mixed vendor sites out therethat what the customers really need is someone to come in and manage thewhole thing for them.andP;  The guy who does that is the guy who has the accountcontrol.&quot;andM;IBM's new approach to bundled, value-added services presents a number of bigquestions for users everywhere.andP;  Just how much of the responsibility fordeveloping and managing IS are users willing to turn over to any outsideentity?andP;  And once they've decided to take on an IS management partner, is IBMthe logical choice?andP;  Does IBM have the objectivity and the in-depthapplications experience it takes to solve IS problems?andP;  (see &quot;IBM Redefinesthe Competition,&quot; p.andP;  37).andM;Even some users who have plugged into the new full-service IBM are notconvinced.andP;  Chrysler Motors is often cited as an example of an IBMcustomer/partner, bringin Big Blue in on important IS projects.andP;  On a coupleof occasions, in fact, Chrysler has taken IBM up on its offer to act as anintegrator/consultant.andP;  But, says Chrysler MIS director Nick Simonds,&quot;Frankly, I don't think [partnering with IBM] is going to be a majordirection for us.&quot;andP;  Chrysler has worked closely with IBM on two projects, oneof which, an automated plant-floor product identification project, has beenabandoned in favor of a less-costly approach.andM;&quot;IBM's greatest claim is that it makes damn good computers.andP;  But that doesn'tmean it knows anything about applications,&quot; says Simonds.andM;Few, however, would question whether IBM is taking its new customer-driven,solutions-oriented mandate seriously.andP;  The organization run by NedLautenbach, IBM vice president and general manager of the company'sApplication Solutions operation, has received orders--and resources--to getout and work with key customers, consultants, system integrators, andapplication developers to understand users, their applications, and theirbusinesses.andP;  The Systems Integration Div., for example, is one of the fastestgrowing businesses in IBM, having added &quot;several thousand&quot; technical supportpeople since last spring, according to Ebker.andP;  Many of those additions camefrom the 20,000 IBM manufacturing and staff employees redeployed as part ofIBM's cost cutting efforts.andM;IBM's rediscovery of value-added services and solution selling hasn't beenlost on most users as IBM has sent streams of sales representatives out topitch new services and to propose so-called vendor/user partnerships.andP;  &quot;Whatyou've got is a human wave of IBM marketing reps and SEs seeking partnershipswith enterprise accounts.andP;  And suddenly everyone is an enterprise account,&quot;says International Technology Group's Brian Jeffery.andM;Top IBM officials are willing to admit that all of this emphasis oncustomer-driven marketing is a reaction, not just to user needs for quick,reliable solutions but also to what is widely perceived as IBM's loss ofcustomer focus in the early and mid-1980s.andP;  &quot;We were victims of our ownsuccess in the early '80s,&quot; says Ebker.andP;  &quot;We sold as much new product as wecould make, so it was easy to focus on products and maybe give up on otherthings that weren't perceived as being necessary.&quot;andM;Some major users have jumped at IBM's offer to become their IR partner.andP;  Inkey industries, users such as United Airlines, Ford, and Du Pont have broughtIBM in to play a key role in developing major new systems.andP;  They say that IBMis a logical partner because it has the resources and the hardware andsoftware knowledge.andP;  IBM gets valuable industry-specific applicationsexperience as well as significant pull-through product sales.andM;For example, Galileo, the European automated airline-reservation-system jointventure, recently awarded IBM a $100 million-plus systems integrationcontract.andP;  IBM, which has put 60 engineers on the project and will installfour new mainframes and hundreds of workstations, has described the contractas one of its largest ever in Europe.andM;According to Galileo technical services vice president Jerry Kraus, IBM wasbrought in on the project because its 10 airline partners wanted the systemup as quickly as possible in the face of pressure from the competing EuropeanAMR-led Amadeus consortium.andP;  And IBM could offer clear technical leadershipin two technologies key to the project, IBM's proprietary Systems NetworkArchitecture and Transaction Processing Facility.andM;On top of that, a key Galileo participant, United Airlines, through its Coviasubsidiary, had plenty of experience using IBM as an integration partner inthe U.S.andP;  &quot;We decided to tie into IBM on this to try to make sure that it waspersonally involved and committed to the success of the project,&quot; says Kraus.andM;According to Kraus, Galileo is keenly aware of the danger of being lockedinto IBM and its proprietary products.andP;  Although IBM is expected to continueas a development partner for several years, Kraus points out that severalGalileo partners, including Covia, have enough experience with TPF and SNA toavoid losing control of the project.andP;  In addition, project planners pointout, Galileo will be implementing SNA on top of Galileo's own proprietarycommunications manager and API set.andP;  That would give Galileo more controlover the project.andM;Not all users are quite as sold on the value of plugging into IBM, however.andO;Many IS executives faced with both long development backlogs and urgentdemands for new strategic systems say that they wouldn't mind getting someconsulting and integration help.andP;  But they question whether IBM is the rightplace to look for it.andM;Specifically, some users wonder whether IBM can achieve the objectivity orthe technical expertise required.andP;  &quot;We've been approached by IBM on a coupleof extended services, but we don't have any interest,&quot; says Douglas R.andO;Plescia, corporate data systems manager for Toyota Motor Sales in Torrance,Calif.andP;  &quot;One of the problems, frankly, is the technical proficiency of theirSEs.&quot;andP;  And some users wonder whether or not IBM is really prepared to delivernon-IBM hardware-based solutions.andM;IBM's Retraining ChallengeandM;Executives throughout IBM answer that they are aware that the marketing forceneeds to undergo a major retraining if solutions selling is to work.andP;  Theysay that they're already spending hundreds of millions of dollars on boostingthe technical training of marketing representatives and systems engineers.andO;&quot;We're training our people so that they understand our customers' business aswell as our own.andP;  It's hard work,&quot; says Ned Lautenbach.andM;If IBM is serious about this, it will also be an expensive undertaking.andO;Chicago-based Arthur Andersen andamp; Co.'s managing partner in charge of researchand development, Mel Bergstein, estimates that his company's consulting andsystems integration business spends $6,500 annually per employee on training.andO;&quot;IBM will have to put the money in as well as change the organization beforeit starts to turn things around,&quot; says Bergstein.andM;Meanwhile, though IBM still has a long way to got to become the superconsultant/integrator it envisions, its competitors aren't discounting itschances.andP;  Competitors like Amdahl and Oracle are also investing in expandingvalue-added services such as consulting and systems integration.andP;  Andtraditional systems integrators are becoming concerned with the competitivethreat posed by IBM, even as they are brought into systems integrationprojects to work alongside Big Blue.andM;&quot;It's like when someone's petting a dog while he looks around for a rock.andP;  Inthis case, IBM's doing the petting right now,&quot; says Arthur Andersen'sBergstein.andM;Such a view may be a bit reactionary.andP;  But if IBM's big bet--that users wantthe ability to plug into a company that will handle its IS needs efficientlyand transparently--is right, such a world could be irresistible for ISmanagers everywhere.andP;  If Big Blue is wrong, however, it may find itselfmerely processing the bills that others are sending.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
