White (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> F GOVMT </CO><IN> TNM BNK </IN><TEXT>   First Nationwide Bank, a unit of Ford Motor Co., bought ailing Lincoln Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, of Westfield, N.J., with the help of a $145.7 million aid package from the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.    The deal gives First Nationwide, a $24 billion institution based in San Francisco, a solid foothold in the New Jersey financial market through Lincoln's 15 branches, and the bank launched a $1 million initial marketing campaign to herald its move.    &quot;We wanted to be in New Jersey badly,&quot; said First Nationwide's president, John Devine, in a telephone interview. First Nationwide had a branch in Cherry Hill, N.J., near Philadelphia. But the Lincoln acquisition gives First Nationwide a presence in the northeastern part of the state. &quot;We have 31 branches in New York, there's clearly a crossover&quot; there, Mr. Devine said.    Lincoln, which was officially declared insolvent Friday afternoon, was the victim of a lending strategy that concentrated on commercial loans in Texas, Oklahoma, Colorado and other oil-patch states, a FSLIC spokesman said. As of June 30, the thrift had $1.27 billion in assets and $1.32 billion in liabilities, and a negative net worth of $56.4 million. The institution had $69.8 million in delinquent or non-performing loans on its books, FSLIC said. Details of the disposition of those loans weren't disclosed.    As part of the transaction, FSLIC is providing $40 million in cash; a sevenyear, $115 million loan at a rate one percentage point below the 26-week Treasury bill rate; and a guarantee to pick up 90% of the after-tax capital losses on certain Lincoln assets. The current value of the package was put at $145.7 million by FSLIC.    For its part, FSLIC will get 80% of any gains First Nationwide realizes from using Lincoln's operating losses to offset taxes.    The transaction also includes a relatively new gimmick designed to protect First Nationwide in the event FSLIC defaults on its note. The device, called a &quot;pocket charter,&quot; will allow the San Francisco institution to place the note in a newly chartered thrift, together with an equal amount of liabilities, if FSLIC defaults. That way, First Nationwide would avoid harm from a FSLIC default.    The Bank Board provided a pocket charter in the acquisition of Bell Savings andamp; Loan Association of San Mateo, Calif., by an investor group led by former Treasury Secretary William Simon. But the Lincoln Federal transaction was the first in which the Bank Board announced its use of the device.    Many companies have been hesitant to acquire insolvent thrifts for fear that the FSLIC might be unable to honor its commitments. While disclosing its use of the pocket charter device in the First Nationwide case, the Bank Board asserted that default is unlikely because Congress's General Accounting Office and the Treasury Department have said that FSLIC notes are backed by the full faith and credit of the federal government.    Meanwhile, First Nationwide is still shopping. It is a bidder in the competition to take over the largest remaining insolvent thrift company in Texas, First Texas Financial Corp. Mr. Devine declined to comment on that situation. </TEXT></DOC>
