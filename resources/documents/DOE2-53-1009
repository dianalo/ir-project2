One of the most serious problems of the Agencytoday is seen as the process of politicization whereby governments introduceinto the Agency's affairs political issues extraneous to its statutorytasks in apparent indifference to the negative effects this may haveon its work. Another problem to which the author devotes considerablespace is the credibility of the Agency's safeguards. Considerable discussionis devoted to the connection between the Agency's creation and the disarmamentquestion of that time.</TEXT></DOC>
