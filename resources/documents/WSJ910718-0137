The Time board chose not tosubmit to shareholders a last-minute high-price takeover bidfrom Paramount Communications, and instead completed a mergerwith Warner Communications. And Time Warner's attempt,abandoned just last week, to sell a new stock offering toexisting shareholders at a price they would not be told inadvance, as well as the $78 million remuneration of ChairmanSteve Ross, have kept the controversy boiling. But in fact,the Delaware courts' decision in Paramount Communications v.Time Inc., generally known as Time/Warner, was both good lawand good economics.   The Time Warner merger may have been a bad idea. CertainlyTime's shareholders have made less money than they wouldhave, had Time's board accepted Paramount's offer. But therole of courts is to enforce pre-existing contract rights,not to punish disinterested mistakes by corporate management.And according to the corporate contract between Time'smanagement and its shareholders, Time's directors had everyright to make the decision they did.</LP><TEXT>   The essence of the corporation is a contractual divisionof labor between owners (shareholders) and operators(managers) of the company. Under this mutually agreed-uponseparation of ownership and control, management isresponsible for conducting the company's affairs.Shareholders who wish to reserve certain decisions forthemselves can write those exceptional matters into thecontract (the articles of incorporation). Owners who wish tobe the operators of their own companies typically write adifferent contract, a sole proprietorship or partnership.   The law's role in this system is simply to enforce theallocation of property rights established by the contract --a task that includes interpreting the agreement's ambiguousterms and providing missing terms for contingencies notmentioned in the contract. As in business law generally,courts have been reluctant to substitute their judgment forthat of the parties. Under the &quot;business judgment rule,&quot;courts almost never enjoin or punish directors' decisions, aslong as they are honest attempts to make money forshareholders. Finding cases where courts have intervened in adisinterested board decision, however mistaken, requires whatone scholar has called &quot;a search for a very small number ofneedles in a very large haystack.&quot;   There are four good economic reasons for this judicialreluctance to intervene in corporate decision-making.   First, economic well-being is maximized by allowingparties to decide on the the allocation of their ownresources.   Second, judges are poorly positioned to second-guessmanagement decisions. Specialized managers, with morecomplete information, will generally make better decisionsthan courts could.   Third, were courts routinely to hold directors liable forhonest but mistaken decisions, directors would shrink fromhighrisk transactions that offered the possibility of highprofit, to the ultimate detriment of shareholders.   Fourth, shareholders have ways to protect themselves fromdirector error. Shareholders can reserve decisions tothemselves, or fire erring directors after the fact. Theinformation needed to appraise management's performance isprovided daily by the stock market.   Absent self-interested dealings by directors, then, apurchaser of shares essentially enters into an agreement thatthe board will make those decisions not reserved for theshareholders. If a shareholder wants to help manage a carcompany, buying General Motors or Ford stock is not the wayto do it -- unless he buys enough to choose the managers.   Before the rise of takeover-related litigation, fewprinciples of law were better established than the businessjudgment rule. But in the 1980s new offensive and defensivetactics in the financial markets caused judges unfamiliarwith the maneuvering to intervene in management decisionsmore frequently. Judges' initial uncertainty about whether toapply the business judgment rule in takeover battles wasperhaps understandable. Successful takeovers are oftenfollowed by changes in the managerial ranks. Courts worriedthat defensive tactics might be motivated by managers' desireto preserve their positions at the shareholders' expense.   But the reasoning behind the business judgment rule isjust as valid in takeover cases as in others. Courts usuallyhave no way to distinguish disinterested from selfinteresteddefensive tactics. Directors frequently will honestly believethat a bid is inadequate. Since first bids are almost neverthe highest a company can get, management needs somedefensive measure to fend off those offers. What looks like aself-interested attempt to preserve management's jobs can infact be a reasonable gamble to increase shareholder welfare.   So a 1985 study of one defensive tacticfiling suit againsta raider -- found that in 77% of the instances where thefirst offer was defeated, there was eventually a change incorporate control -- but at a higher premium forshareholders. Even in the 23% of cases where there never wasa second bid, the board may well have made a reasonable butlosing gamble.   It is important to note what was not at stake in theTime/Warner case. The case was not about managerialentrenchment at shareholders' expense. All Time outsidedirectors but one approved the merger with Warner. Timeplanned the combination with Warner &quot;only after what could befairly characterized as an exhaustive appraisal of Time'sfuture as a corporation&quot; over the previous six years, in thewords of the Delaware Supreme Court. Well before Paramount'sbid, Time had already studied and rejected for purelybusiness reasons a combination with that company.   Since the Time Warner deal was apparently motivated bybusiness reasons, not self-interest, the Delaware SupremeCourt held that the issue in the case was simply whether Timewas &quot;entitled to the benefit and protection of the businessjudgment rule.&quot; To enjoin the transaction &quot;would involve thecourt in substituting its judgment for what is a `better'deal for that of a corporation's board of directors.&quot;   Perhaps then and certainly now, one could well concludethat the Time board was wrong to complete the Warner sharepurchase. But criticism of the Time/Warner decision, asopposed to the Time Warner transaction, mischaracterizes therole of courts. The sole ground for the Delaware decision wasenforcement of the respective property rights established byshareholders and management.   ---   Mr. McChesney teaches law at Emory University in Atlanta.Prof. William J.
