Bush said he would make permanent a 2-month-old suspension onimportation of the semiautomatic assault-style rifles if agovernment review finds they are not for sporting purposes, as isrequired under current law.   The president outlined his proposals at a police memorialservice outside the Capitol before a rain-drenched crowd ofthousands huddled under umbrellas and plastic sheets or standingunprotected.   The audience included more than 700 relatives of the 161officers killed in the line of duty nationwide last year. Alsopresent were uniformed officers from around the country.   Bush turned away an aide offering an umbrella during thedrizzling rain. ``If it doesn't start clearing up,'' he joked,``we're issuing snorkels to everybody out there.''   Although many U.S.-made models of semi-automatic weapons arevirtually identical to their foreign competitors, Bush decided notto apply the same ban to the domestic market.   Instead, he took on the controversial issue from a differentapproach: he proposed legislation to block manufacture, transfer orsale of gun magazines capable of holding more than 15 rounds.   The president said that during the heated debate overgun-control and semiautomatic weapons, he has heard many opinionsand voices, including those of crime victims and families.   ``We gather today to respond to those voices, and to honor thefallen by launching a new national strategy _ a partnership withAmerica's cities and states _ to take back the streets,'' he said.   Bush noted the debate over how to distinguish criminally usedassault weapons from those used for hunting and sport.   ``There is substantial controversy and debate on this point. Butone thing that we do know about these `assault' weapons is thatthey invariably are equipped with unjustifiably large magazines,''he said.   An administration official who briefed reporters on the packageearlier shrugged off questions about why the domestic market wasbeing treated differently than the imports when the weapons havethe same firpower.   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said onlythat existing import laws provide for a crackdown on theforeign-made models while new legislation _ which would likelyinvolve a thorny and drawn-out congressional battle _ would beneeded for the domestic guns.   In trying to determine what set semiautomatic assault weaponsapart, administration officials found the ``large detachable''magazines were a common factor.   Thus, domestic weapons, while not banned from sale, would berestricted by the 15-round magazine ban.   ``The fact of the matter is, nearly half the households in thiscountry have guns. The guns are already out there. And theoverwhelming majority are legitimately owned for legitimatepruposes,'' Bush said in his speech.   However, he said, 80 percent of all firearms used by felons arestolen or otherwise obtained unlawfully. ``So let me be very clearabout our response: the right to own guns is not a license to harmothers,'' he said.   The president's anti-crime package contained several measuresaimed at stiffer enforcement, more federal officers and a crackdownon gun use among criminals.   Among the provisions he proposed:   _Doubling the current five-year minimum sentence for using asemiautomatic firearm in commission of a crime.   ``The math is simple,'' Bush said. ``Anyone who uses asemiautomatic for crime _ or so much as has one on them during acrime _ will do an automatic 10 extra years in federal prison. Noprobation. No parole.''   _Implementing the death penalty and designating the use of afirearm as an ``aggravating factor'' for determining whether thedeath penalty should be imposed.   _Spending $1 billion for new prison construction.   _Authorizing 825 new federal agents and staff in the Bureau ofAlcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, U.S. Marshal Service and FBI.   Bush said, ``Our police need more help. And I'm here today totell you that we're prepared to match rhetoric with resources _ andcall on our cities and states to do the same.''   _Blocking the practice of plea-bargaining away charges of usinga gun in commission of a federal crime. Bush urged state and localgovernments to similarly reform their laws so that anyone using agun would be prosecuted for that charge.   _Requiring juveniles to be tried as adults for cases consideredserious drug offenses under the Armed Career Criminal statute.   _Strengthening laws against criminal access to firearms byexpanding the existing ban on sales to people convicted of violentcrimes, to cover anyone convicted of violent misdemeanor offenses.   _Adding 1,600 positions in the U.S. attorneys' office.   _Identifying government properties and facilities that can beconverted to jails and prisons.   _Offering a 5 percent bonus to drug law enforcement grants tostates that follow his standards on stiffening penalties for use ofa gun in committing a crime.   On the assault weapons matter, Bush ordered the Bureau ofAlcohol, Tobacco and Firearms two months ago to review uses ofimported semiautomatic assault weapons to determine if they areused for other than sporting purposes. Current law allows theimports for only that purpose, but because of the sticky definitionquestions, many have been allowed in that will be banned after thereview, administration officials said.</TEXT></DOC>
