Its commandingred, white and blue presence gives Gene Deeter goosebumps.   Amid the pulsating clangor of the Ball Corp. plant, Mr.Deeter, a Vietnam veteran whose paratrooper son may soon seecombat in the Gulf, expresses confidence that the U.S. willwin.</LP><TEXT>   Confidence about the U.S. economy is another matter,however. Instead of enjoying his steady $40,000-a-yearsalary, Mr. Deeter is hunkering down. Before the war, heplanned to trade in his three-year-old GMC pickup truck for anew one. &quot;Now, I've decided to keep the old one and pay itoff,&quot; he says. &quot;Our troops are going through hard times, andthere are a lot of things I can do without.&quot;   Such caution may be surprising in this Midwestmanufacturing town of 38,650. So far, it has largelysidestepped the recession. Its unemployment rate is 4.5%, oneof the lowest in Ohio. The Whirlpool Corp. appliance plantnorth of town is hiring 300 more people. Businesses asdiverse as semiconductor maker Harris Corp., Marathon Oil Co.and Cooper Tire andamp; Rubber Co. are doing well. A new industrialpark has brought in 13 manufacturers in the past three years-- and added 2,000 jobs.   &quot;If any town in America should be optimistic right now,it's Findlay, Ohio,&quot; Mayor Keith Romick says.   But it isn't. Inside the factories and along Main Street,the mood is downbeat. Most small businesses report sharplylower store traffic and sales since the war. The new shoppingmall east of town is often nearly empty. Retailers there saybusiness is dreadful, and they worry that it will get worseif a ground war begins.   That Findlay should be so downcast could be ominous forthe nation. If consumers here and in other Middle Americancities hold down their spending, the recession won't endanytime soon. That concern is shared by Federal Reserve BoardChairman Alan Greenspan, who has said that if the war isn'tover by mid-April, the nation could face a long, deeprecession.   So far, there is plenty of evidence that consumers arealready spooked by the war. One survey by the University ofMichigan reports consumer confidence 7.2% lower than beforethe war began. Sales of U.S.-made autos in the final third ofJanuary plummeted 31% from a year earlier. And retailers,too, are hurting.   What is happening in Findlay also highlights the deepdivision between Main Street and Wall Street. War has sentthe Dow Jones Industrial Average up nearly 400 points. But ifWall Streeters visited the A.G. Edwards branch here, theymight feel a little less giddy. The brokerage office iscrowded each noon with businessmen stopping by to watch CNNand discuss the war reports. And they are far from bullish.   James Wilkins, a Marathon executive, says he sold $20,000in stock mutual funds prior to the war and bought municipalbonds and money-market funds. Local brokers who call and urgehim to buy get nowhere. &quot;I'm not coming back into the marketuntil the depths of war and recession are known,&quot; he says.   Since Jan. 16, stockbroker Ward Abbey has been sellingstocks steadily and buying bonds for antsy investors seekingsafety. &quot;There's real fear of this war in our community, andwhere it's going to lead us,&quot; he says. &quot;The market'sdeclaring victory, but we're certainly not.&quot;   Not that residents aren't patriotic. The only city inAmerica to be officially designated Flag City U.S.A. byCongress, Findlay is festooned with red, white and blue; 16flags and as many yellow ribbons decorate just one block ofMain Street.   People here are preoccupied with the war perhaps partlybecause media coverage of it is so omnipresent. And otherreminders are everywhere: flags, big and small; handmadeposters that read &quot;GO USA&quot;; people wearing yellow lapelribbons inscribed, &quot;Support the American Troops in the MiddleEast&quot;; and marquees in front of movie theaters, gas stationsand restaurants exhorting people to be patriotic. Last week,the local newspaper, the Courier, ran a full-page Americanflag in color and asked readers to show their support for thetroops by displaying this flag.   At the Whirlpool plant, where some 300 yellow ribbons aretied to trees out front, workers asked for and got five TVsets in their lunchroom to monitor CNN broadcasts. Even atelementary schools, television interrupts the silence of thelibrary.   Settled early in the 19th century, Findlay is anindustrious, affluent community. People tend to go to workearly and leave late. A long row of Main Street mansions,some valued at as much as $750,000, testifies to the oilfortunes made here early in the century and to the city'swealth now. Larry Warner, a Buick and Nissan dealer, says all38 customers who bought a car from him in November paid cash.   That same prosperity is apparent in Findlay's factories.Whirlpool has just sunk $120 million into its sprawlingdishwasher and stove plant, as it consolidates its NorthAmerican dishwasher manufacturing. Yet the war &quot;has put ourwork force on edge,&quot; says Dennis Krueger, the plant manager.Not even the clean, friendly workplace inspires muchconfidence. In a random sampling of workers, half say theyare more cautious about spending money today than a monthago.   &quot;I'm kind of nervous,&quot; says Pat Julien, as she plugs wirerelays on a range panel. &quot;I was thinking about buying a newcar, but I won't now.&quot;   Elsewhere, Diane &quot;Huggie&quot; Hughart, whom Mr. Kruegerpraises as &quot;one of my most valuable employees,&quot; is anxious,too. &quot;I just hope the war doesn't affect our jobs,&quot; she says.Her concern worries Mr. Krueger. &quot;If that same conservativethinking continues to spread,&quot; he says, &quot;it will eventuallyaffect us here.&quot;   He need look no further for the connection betweenappliance production and sales than Skip Tate's store inFindlay. The city's leading appliance store is empty atmidday. Since the war started, Mr. Tate says, his sales havefallen at least 15%. &quot;The only people buying are those whoabsolutely need replacement appliances,&quot; he adds. As hespeaks, one shopper, an old man wearing a fedora, inquiresabout a small color TV to replace one that quit.   Findlay, the biggest town in rural Hancock County, is theregion's shopping hub. But fewer people come to town now tobuy their staples, according to James Heck, who owns threegrocery stores -- one in town and two in outlying areas.Since the war, he says, the one in Findlay has lost businessand the others have gained. &quot;People are clearly drivingless,&quot; he says. &quot;They're shopping closer to home.&quot;   At the mall, which is nearly empty on some midweek nights,discount and sale signs abound. Scott Johnson, who owns atrendy men's clothing store, says, &quot;Business was bad beforethe war. Now, it's awful.&quot; The war has cut store traffic 10%,he estimates, despite 50% reductions on some items and 25% onothers. To cut costs, he says, he is whittling downinventories of slow-moving apparel, such as $300 leatherjackets and hard-to-find sizes.   At McDowell Travel, Sarah Walker, an agent, says businessis off 50% because of higher air fares and customers' fearsabout terrorism. One of her customers, Bruce Zitkovic, whorecently canceled a vacation flight to Florida, says, &quot;I justdidn't want to take a chance.&quot;   Of course, not everyone is pulling back. Realtor GaryNoakes calls January a &quot;great&quot; month, with home sales up 25%from a year earlier. Two prospects, Randal and Sandra Flesch,both 24 years old, say that although they have cut back on&quot;frivolous&quot; spending such as eating out, they still intend tobuy their first home -- war or not. &quot;We've been consideringit over the last six months, but with interest rates comingdown, now seems like a good time,&quot; says Mr. Flesch, anaccountant at Marathon Oil.   Meanwhile, Findlay's big businesses are plugging along.Marathon's operating earnings more than doubled in the fourthquarter, giving its owner, USX Corp., a 9% increase in netincome. But because Marathon buys twice as much crude oil asit produces, oil-price volatility could hurt earnings thisyear.   Harris Corp.'s Findlay plant, the nation's largestsupplier of integrated circuits to the military, makescomputer chips for Patriot missiles and other hardware.Nonetheless, John Mainzer, a vice president, says he hasn'tseen any upturn in orders and doesn't expect one. &quot;I thinkconditions will be pretty flat for us this year,&quot; he says.   Unlike other tire makers, Cooper Tire andamp; Rubber has postedconsistently strong earnings, but Chairman Ivan Gorr sayssales and earnings growth this year may be a bit below what&quot;we had planned.&quot; He adds: &quot;There's a drag out there.Business could be better.&quot;   The same refrain is heard at a 6:45 a.m. meeting of thelocal Kiwanis Club. After singing &quot;My Country, 'Tis of Thee&quot;and &quot;God Bless America&quot; and giving prayful thanks for theirjobs, the members are soon talking mainly about the war.&quot;What do you think will happen with the economy?&quot; asks TimYoungpeter, who has just opened a pastry shop at the mall.Getting no answer from his colleagues, he tries to reassurehimself. &quot;Things will come back once the war's over,&quot; hesays.   Even now, a few residents are looking beyond the war. JeffHall, a sign painter, has been painting flags on businesswindows throughout the city. The &quot;We Support Our Troops inthe Middle East&quot; overlay can be removed easily, he says, oncethe war ends. Then, he will replace it, for a charge, with&quot;Flag City U.S.A.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
