If you've been following the case on the evening news,then you have a sense of the headlines, the highlights. Butup where the numbers run off the cable dial, the fledglingCourtroom Television Network (Court TV) has been covering thetrial live, from gavel to gavel. For those that follow thisvoluminous coverage, it's a whole other experience -- at oncenumbing and riveting. It is, in short, the closest thing to ajury's-eye-view of this rape trial.</LP><TEXT>   One of the first things you notice on Court TV is that thelines in this battle of the sexes are clearly drawn. Lastweek was the week of the women: A female prosecutorquestioned the female alleged rape victim, whose story wascorroborated by female friends, female detectives and femalemedical experts. (A couple of male witnesses at the end ofthe week -- the Kennedys -- began the case that the maledefense attorney will build for his male client this week.)   You also notice something else: This isn't &quot;L.A. Law.&quot;There are no flashy camera cuts here, just one camera, stuckoff in the corner, and it can barely pan from side to side.As for the Palm Beach courtroom, it looks so ticky-tack --with its photo of the U.S. flag and its fake wood veneer --that it has to be real. And while we've come to expect thelaw to be dramatic -- the Perry Mason revelations, thedevastating Sifuentes summations -- the real thing isdramatic, but it's a drama of minutiae.   On the stand, witness Anne Mercer says she was paid$40,000 for two interviews by &quot;A Current Affair.&quot; We learnthat the alleged victim had Caesar salad and rigatoni on thenight in question. We learn that three latent fingerprintsmatching those of a certain John Butler were lifted from hercar-left index, left middle and left ring finger.   And then of course, we hear her whole sad powerfultestimony, a story told between sobs: &quot;He tackled me. . . . Iwas on the ground. . . . He was crushing me. He had mepinned. . . . I was yelling, `No] Stop]' . . . He slammed meback on the ground. . . . &quot; There is a theatricality tocross-examination, and defense attorney Roy Black wasbrutally repetitive as he tried to slice away at the allegedvictim's statement: &quot;Did you have your pantyhose on when yougot to the Kennedy home? . . . Did you have your pantyhose onwhen you were in the car, in the parking lot? . . . Did youhave your pantyhose on when you got out of the car? . . . Didyou have your pantyhose on when you went into the house? . .. &quot;   Now there are several larger questions about this TVcoverage, beginning with whether there should even be acamera in the courtroom? But during this rape trial, what Ikeep wondering is how are they able to put all this luriddetail on daytime TV? How can they carry this talk about theterrible violence of rape, about tearing clothing andinserting body parts, all in the most sexually explicitlanguage, in an era when networks won't even broadcast condomads, ads that could actually save a few lives? As for thecoverage itself, it takes an odd form, but one my lawyerfriends tell me is appropriate: Court TV covers trials(Florida v. Smith and others) like sports programs. In atrial, after all, there are two sides, a referee, tactics,winners and losers. And so Court TV offers a pre-game show,and plenty of color commentary along the way.   How is it doing? Commercially, not all that well. Inbetween tearful testimony, there are only a few ads, forproducts like the Tummysizer and the inopportune SouthFlorida Cruises. Anchors like the homespun Fred Graham andthe smug Gregg Jarrett don't do much to help the cause nordoes Court TV editor in chief Steven Brill's exercise inself-promotion, getting his anchors to interview him. But thereal stars of Court TV, besides the crisp, appealing CynthiaMcFadden, are the all-star commentators, including F. LeeBailey, Floyd Abrams, NYU's Burt Neuborne, Harvard's ArthurMiller. Old, balding, bespectacled -- not much TV Q here, buta lot of IQ.   When Court TV works, as in Palm Beach, it works as astrange mix of soap opera and educational programming, &quot;Daysof Our Lives&quot; meets the Learning Channel. On-screen cardsgive background information (&quot;Roy Black, 46, received thehighest score in the 1970 Florida Bar Exam&quot;; Prosecutor MoiraLasch &quot;prosecuted the `Soldier of Fortune' murder-for-hiretrial&quot;). Commentators give play-by-play commentary: &quot;It'salmost impossible to believe this redirect. . . . If theprosecution wins, it'll be almost in spite of itself.&quot;   Some people say Court TV is boring. A few of my friendscompare it to &quot;watching paint dry.&quot; But I like Court TV, evenif it has a different rhythm. I like that it flies in theface of today's trends, MTV and the six-second soundbite. Inan era where everything is speeded up, it couldn't be slower,more hypnotic. Down in Palm Beach, there's even time to hearabout the juror who hasn't eaten breakfast. He's upset abouthis wife. Everyone else in the nation may be fascinated withthis trial, but she's demanding that he stop thissequestration nonsense and come home at once.   Which is what I like most about Court TV. In the middle ofall this fuss, it restores things to a human scale; it givesus time for human reactions -- to look into people's faces,to listen to their voices, to see how we feel.</TEXT></DOC>
