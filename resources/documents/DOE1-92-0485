<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-92-0485 </DOCNO><TEXT>A thermostated smog chamber, combined with gas chromatographic trace analysis,was designed to simulate the photochemical degradation of terpenes inthe ppbv-level. A new method of evaluation, adopted for a test guidelineof the OECD, is employed to determine simultaneously the reactivity againstozone and OH. The reactivity of 19 olefins against ozone and of 15 hydrocarbonsagainst OH was determined. Furthermore, the formation of OH radicalsoriginating from O/sub 3/-degradation of olefins could be detected, evenin the absence of light. For a transient product formed from {alpha}-pinene,pinonic acid, the reactivity against OH could be determined in the aerosol-bornestate. In simulation experiments of photosmog for the biogenic {alpha}-pinenea lower ozone forming potential was observed than for the anthropogeniccis-butene-(2) and propene. (orig.)
