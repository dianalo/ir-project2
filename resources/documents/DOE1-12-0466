Analysisis made in the analytical scanning transmission electron microscope ata magnification of 10,000x. With the use of a special counting method,the sensitivity is approximately 80,000 fibers per gram dry tissue withlengths andless;5 {mu}m and 40,000 fibers per gram dry tissue with lengths {ge}5{mu}m. In spite of the leaching and contamination effects described inthe literature - even for chrysotile fibrils taken from the lung, elementalspectra do not differ essentially from the asbestos standard. In orderto carry out a complete check of the preparation method, a suspensionof standard crocidolite fibers in water was gelatinated. No changes inlength, diameter or aspect ratio distribution occurred. After preparation,at least 40% of the fibers were recovered. Compared to the wide rangeof fiber concentrations observed in human lung tissue, these recoveryrates appear adequate for fiber analysis in lung dust for medical orlegal purposes. To date, 70 lung dust specimens have been analyzed. Theseare discussed in the paper.</TEXT></DOC>
