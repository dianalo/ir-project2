The method is an outgrowth of and related to the transientkinetics approach to the measurement of kinetic rate parameters for char-gasreactions that has been developed in our laboratory. It can be shownthat the initial transient behavior of a species introduced as a step-functioninto a ``gradientless'' reactor in which char is present, is controlledby the transport resistance offered by the char micropores. Therefore,this data can be analyzed for micropore diffusion time constants. Inaddition, due to the time-resolved nature of the process in the reactor,the initial diffusion step is separated (in time) from any subsequentgas-solid reaction steps. Therefore, diffusion measurements can be performedunder gasification conditions. This quarter was devoted to developinga method for estimating micropore and micropore volumes needed for analysisof the transient data. In addition, a technique to characterize the charsin a more comprehensive fashion for use with the computer model has beendeveloped. 3 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
