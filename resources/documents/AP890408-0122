Gen.Prosper Avril said Saturday that loyal troops crushed a mutinyafter two days of fighting and that most of the rebel soldiers werecaptured.   ``The soldiers of the Presidential Guard presently occupy theDessalines Barracks,'' said a statement issued by the armyadjutant, Gen. Andre Jean-Pierre, and read on state-run radio.   It said most of the rebels in the barracks were captured butsome fled and left behind their uniforms and weapons.   The communique did not say how many rebels were captured or hadescaped. The normal force of the Dessalines Barracks is 750soldiers.   Loyal soldiers shelled the barracks Friday night and resumed theartillery bombardment Saturday morning. There also were firefightsin the area of the barracks, which adjoin the National Palace inthe center of Port-au-Prince.   Casualty figures for Saturday's fighting were not available.   A source close to the government said 17 soldiers, all thoughtto be rebels, were killed in Friday's fighting. Haitians monitoringmilitary radio broadcasts said reports indicated the PresidentialGuard suffered 15 casualties but there was no breakdown of dead andwounded.   The state hospital said at least one civilian was killed Fridayand unconfirmed reports put the civilian death toll at three.   U.S. Embassy spokeswoman Susan Clyde said it was believed twoPresidential Guard soldiers were killed Saturday.   ``The casualty figures apparently are going to be lower than thelevel of noise might have indicated,'' she said.   Port-au-Prince remained calm after the government claimedvictory.   Its communique said the captured rebels implicated drugtraffickers in efforts to overthrow Avril that began April 2 withan attempted coup. It said an anti-government plot was organized byHaitian exiles formerly associated with the ousted regime ofdictator Jean-Claude Duvalier.   The statement also claimed the mastermind of the revolt wasformer Interior Minister Roger Lafontant, who is now living in theDominican Republic, which shares the island of Hispaniola withHaiti.   The statement was issued at 5:15 p.m. EDT after several hours ofheavy shelling of the barracks. Shooting had tapered off shortlybefore the announcement.   U.S. officials said earlier that a hole was blown in the roof ofthe gleaming white National Palace, which serves as thepresidential residence.   It was believed the damage was caused by a mortar shell firedabout a mile away by rebels who fled the barracks Friday night andtook over a Roman Catholic church compound.   Diplomats had said Friday night it appeared Avril's troops hadgained the upper hand and driven the rebels from the compound. Butfierce firefights broke out again Saturday.   Reports Saturday morning said members of the Leopards commandounit who had been involved in the mutiny were seen removing theiruniforms. Witnesses said they abandoned their base in the capital'ssuburbs.   There were no reports of fighting elsewhere in Haiti.   The rebels accuse Avril's government, which took power in amilitary coup six months ago, of favoritism toward the PresidentialGuard in pay and living conditions. They also said the governmentwas arbitrarily dismissing senior officers in a U.S.-supportedcrackdown on drugs and corruption.   In the attempted coup on April 2, rebel soldiers seized Avriland took him to the airport for deportation but he was rescued byloyalist soldiers.   Avril went on television Monday to claim the rebellion had beenput down. However, rebel soldiers continued to roam the capital,clashing with government forces.   Avril, 50, came to power in September 1988 in a coup bynon-commissioned officers that ousted Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy. Theofficers demanded democratic reform and an end to state-sponsoredviolence.   Namphy had deposed a short-lived civilian government. He hadearlier led a junta that took over after Jean-Claude Duvalier wasswept from power in a popular uprising and fled to France inFebruary 1986.   The government blamed the attempted coup earlier this month onpeople opposed to both democratic change and a ``campaign againstdrug trafficking, contraband and corruption.''   The United States has made the drug crackdown a condition forrestoring $70 million in aid that it suspended after thugsmassacred 34 voters in November 1987, thwarting Haiti's first freeelections in more than 30 years.</TEXT></DOC>
