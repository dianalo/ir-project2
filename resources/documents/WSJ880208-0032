The walkout by Ford's 32,500 U.K. hourly workers will stop production at the company's 22 plants in Britain. Ford builds about 2,300 vehicles a day in Britain, with a total sales value of roughly #19.5 million ($34.4 million), a spokesman for Ford's U.K. unit said.    The strike is the most potent sign yet of labor unrest in Britain, where ferry seamen and nurses recently staged brief walkouts. It also represents a potential setback for the government in its efforts to hold down wages and boost productivity, and illustrates a growing assertiveness by rank-and-file union members compared with their leaders. The prospect of a Ford strike sent London shares sharply lower Friday.    Officials at the auto maker's Dearborn, Mich., headquarters wouldn't estimate the strike's daily cost to the company, but said the effect would be greater than losing the U.K. production.    That is because the British strike will affect Ford's other European operations, mainly in West Germany, which depend heavily on British-made engines and parts. Company officials said the subsidiaries are trying to determine how long their supplies will last if new shipments are cut by a strike. Some disruption is expected.    After a breakdown Friday, talks between Ford and union officials didn't resume during the weekend. At Friday's meeting -- which lasted just 15 minutes -- union officials told the company that roughly 62% of their members had rejected a sweetened three-year contract offer. That rejection came despite union leaders' recommendation that members accept the offer.    The company warned union leaders that the sweetened contract offer would be withdrawn if the strike went ahead, the U.K. Ford spokesman said.    Ford's sweetened offer would have given workers a 7% pay increase in the first year, followed by raises pegged 2 1/2 percentage points above the rate of inflation in the subsequent two years. In return, workers would accept changes designed to boost productivity.    The workers' main complaints are the proposed changes in working conditions and the contract's length, said a spokesman for the Transport and General Workers' Union, which represents nearly two-thirds of Britain's Ford workers.    U.K. car sales are a crucial part of Ford's European operations, which have been solidly profitable in recent years. In 1986, European operations earned $559 million, or 17% of Ford's total net income. U.K. operations made up about 20% of the European profit.    The Ford dispute already has sparked worries in Britain of a resurgence of labor strife, which plagued the country in the 1970s. The collapse of talks Friday between Ford and union leaders helped push the London stock market sharply lower. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 index ended the day at 1737.8, down 29.1 points.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Ford shares dropped $1.375 to close at $40.875.    The Ford strike also illustrates the growing assertiveness of rank-and-file workers. Recently, union leaders have sounded more conciliatory -- at least in public -- than have grass-roots members clamoring for a bigger share of Britain's rising wealth.    The Ford strike occurred despite union leaders' approval of the company's most recent offer. On Friday, striking ferry seamen defied a back-to-work order from their union leaders, although most seamen had returned to work yesterday. And some members of the Royal College of Nursing, which has a no-strike rule, have moved to rival unions that staged a one-day walkout last week.    &quot;The union leaders aren't particularly in touch with their members,&quot; especially on issues of pay and working conditions, said Alastair Hatchet, editor of IDS, a U.K. magazine that tracks income trends.    ---   Bradley Stertz in Detroit contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
