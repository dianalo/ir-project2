Measuring ups and downs in employment is the usual way of tracking manufacturing activity. But this method ignores such important factors as the value added in the production process and the speed at which factory equipment is used.    With the Federal Reserve Board's monthly Industrial Production Index as a guide, economists at the Chicago Fed came up with a Midwest Manufacturing Index to measure factory output in the bank's five-state district -- Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan and Wisconsin.    Unfortunately, the first tabulation shows Midwest manufacturing activity for June up just 1.4% from a year earlier, compared with a 3.6% increase for the U.S. as a whole. A revised computation for the first eight months of 1987 put Midwest manufacturing up 2.3%, against 3.5% for the nation.    &quot;I'm not overly concerned,&quot; says Chicago Fed economist Robert Schnorbus. &quot;We're going through a phase of the recovery where our major industries are in a fairly slow expansion phase. One thing helping us is steel, which is getting close to full capacity. It's the major industry in our region right now.&quot;    The stock market's turmoil doesn't rattle Mr. Schnorbus either. &quot;We're a capital goods producing region, and these trends are pretty long run.&quot; Forecasters may be waffling a bit on their predictions for fixed investment, but the outlook is still better than it was a year or two ago, he says. &quot;As long as the investment sector holds up, it should be beneficial to our mix of industries.&quot;    The Chicago Fed sees added hopeful signs for its territory: a bottoming-out of the farm recession, healthy demand for labor as reflected by fat &quot;help wanted&quot; newspaper ad sections, widespread updating of industrial facilities and, at least so far, continued profits by automobile makers despite lower sales volume than in past years.    ---   CUTBACKS IN 1990 CENSUS COVERAGE ordered by the Reagan administration means that a lot of big-city households won't be scrutinized as closely by the Census Bureau as they have been in the past.    In hopes of saving money on the decennial head count, the Office of Management and Budget has told the bureau to limit distribution of the so-called long form, the full-length inquiry with several dozen questions on family size, income, education and housing, to 10 million households. The bureau had argued for a 16-million household sample.    Statisticians believe they must do relatively more interviewing in small towns than in larger population areas to get the same degree of accuracy. This &quot;oversampling&quot; of small communities and rural areas means the Census Bureau won't be able to hit its target of collecting an extended questionnaire from one of every six households in major population centers. Bureau officials worry that the quality of the census data will suffer as a result.    ---   TEXAS LOSES ITS ALLURE for outsiders. The state will attract only 19,000 more newcomers this year than it loses in people moving out of the state, according to a forecast from Southern Methodist University's Center for Enterprising. That's a huge falloff from the 106,000 net in-migration of 1986. The center says economic revival in the Middle West and New England, plus hard times for Texas industries, are leading potential new residents to think twice about moving.    ---   KOREA EXPORTED ITS FIRST HYUNDAI automobile to the U.S. less than two years ago. At last count, Hyundai's Excel was the second-best-selling car in the Western U.S., with nearly 40,000 units sold in the first half of the 1987 model year. Honda's Accord was No. 1 in the 13-state Western region. Outside the West, Hyundai isn't among the top 10 best-selling cars. The figures are from R.L. Polk andamp; Co. of Detroit and Sunset magazine.    ---   TWO-TIER ECONOMY: In New England, wages, salaries, interest, dividends and other sorts of personal income have increased close to 50% during the five-year economic expansion. In the Rocky Mountain states, the rise has been just 28%. The Bureau of Economic Analysis says personal income in each of the New England states rose between 6% and 7% in the 12 months ended last June. Wyoming's personal income dropped 6% in the same period.    ---   EXPORT CHAMP: The just-released figures may be three years old, but the Commerce Department wants you to know that Connecticut in 1984 had a bigger share of its civilian labor force working on manufactured goods for export than any other state. Runners-up were Ohio, Massachusetts, Indiana and Michigan.    ---   BRIEFS: Rolls-Royce sells a new car in greater Los Angeles roughly every other day, says Security Pacific Corp . . . National Rifle Association lobbying brings to 27 the number of states with laws making it illegal to harass hunters . . . Miami; Tampa-St. Petersburg, Fla., and Washington, D.C., have the most Hispanic-owned businesses per 1,000 Hispanics in the local population, according to the Census Bureau. </TEXT></DOC>
