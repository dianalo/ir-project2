(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two of Jim Bakker's former aides weregiven long prison terms and heavy fines, penalties their attorneyblamed on the television evangelist.   U.S. District Judge Robert Potter on Friday sentenced DavidTaggart to 18 years, five months in prison and his brother James to17 years, nine months. He also ordered each to pay $500,000 finesand for the two of them to pay $525,000 in back taxes.   ``They came and they learned everything they did from JimBakker,'' said Ben Cotten, the Taggarts' attorney who said he hadn'tdecided whether to appeal the sentences.   He called the sentences ``unduly harsh.''   David Taggart's prison sentence was the maximum he could havereceived.   Cotten also predicted that if Bakker is convicted in his fraudand conspiracy trial, the PTL founder will receive a stiff sentence.   ``He has to look forward to an even more severe sentence, notonly because of the number of counts he's charged with but becauseof Judge Potter's assessment of responsibility for what went on outthere at PTL,'' Cotten said.   Cotten said there was a possibility of a reduction in sentence inexchange for the Taggarts' testimony against Bakker. David Taggarthas testified. James Taggart has not been called in the case.   Potter announced the sentences after court recessed Friday inBakker's trial. Bakker and another aide are accused of using nearly$4 million in ministry contributions to fund his lavish lifestyle.   The Taggarts were convicted of evading taxes on $1.1 million theyreceived from the ministry _ money they used to pay for personalluxuries, such as expensive trips, a Trump Tower apartment in NewYork and Jaguar cars, according to testimony.   ``Judge Potter sent a message that white-collar crimes aren'tgoing to go unpunished,'' said prosecutor David Brown. ``They liedto the jury under oath and showed no remorse.''   Bakker was not in the courtroom for the sentencing.   Potter blasted the Taggarts, saying:   ``I cannot understand the minds of these defendants. They seem tofeel like they had an unlimited check out there. They kept going toit over the years.   ``White-collar criminals seem to get away with extremely lightsentences. It's time we do something about that.''   Neither Taggart said anything during the short hearing andneither displayed emotion. David Taggart served as Bakker's personalaide; James Taggart worked as PTL's interior decorator. The brothersjoined the ministry as piano players.   In testimony at Bakker's trial Friday, a minister said he felt``robbed and cheated'' after he bought a ``lifetime partnership''from PTL for lodging in a hotel that was never built.   The Rev. Alan Foor, pastor of the United Church of Christ inBeavertown, Pa., testified he was a monthly contributor to PTL, butbecame angry when he learned how well Bakker lived.   For $1,000, people were guaranteed a certain number of nights peryear in a hotel at the ministry's Heritage USA retreat near FortMill, S.C.   Foor said he never used the lodging because the hotel he was apartner in wasn't completed.   In Richmond, Va., a federal appeals court Friday denied Bakker'smotion for a stay of his trial. The 4th U.S. Circuit Court ofAppeals also rejected Bakker's motion to dismiss the indictmentagainst him.</TEXT></DOC>
