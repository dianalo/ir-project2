ROSENTHAL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Former National Security Adviser Robert C.McFarlane testified Monday he thought he was followingthen-President Reagan's policy when he withheld from Congressinformation about Oliver North's activities for the NicaraguanContras.   ``The policy of the president to me was to keep this movementtogether, and outside contributions from third countries were not tobe shared,'' said McFarlane, testifying as a prosecution witness inNorth's trial. He was referring specifically to money solicited fromSaudi Arabia for the rebels.   In addition, prosecutors read into the court record a separateMcFarlane statement in which he said he had acted ``under theguidance and emphatic policy instructions of the president.''   The statement was made 10 days ago to the judge who sentencedMcFarlane to pay a $20,000 fine and contribute 200 hours ofcommunity service for his own part in the Iran-Contra affair.McFarlane pleaded guilty to four misdemeanors, but North, his formeraide, faces 12 felony counts.   McFarlane will return Tuesday for a third day of testimony.   Prosecutor John Keker asked him Monday if he interpreted Reagan's``instructions to permit lies to Congress.''   ``No,'' he said.   Again and again, throughout the day, he said that if there isblame for North's actions, it should be his because he was North'ssuperior at the National Security Council.   McFarlane added that after leaving government ``I probably got arise out of him'' when he offered North a job.   For the first time in weeks of trial, North smiled broadly.   McFarlane said that on two occasions he talked with Reagan aboutthe millions of dollars contributed for the Contras by Saudi Arabia.   The first time, in June 1984 just after Congress shut off U.S.aid to the guerrillas, McFarlane said, he sent a note with thepresident's daily intelligence briefing book informing the presidentthat the Saudis had agreed to contribute $1 million a month for theContra cause.   ``Good, let's just make sure it stays that way,'' McFarlane saidReagan told him in a return note.   In February 1985, McFarlane said, he learned from the Saudiambassador that the Middle Eastern country was going to double itsgiving and he again told the president. The Saudis eventually gave atotal of $32 million.   ``If the president of the United States says something like`let's keep quiet,' is that a direction to lie to other officialbodies?'' Keker asked.   ``No,'' said McFarlane.   He pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges involving withholdinginformation from Congress. Criminal charges at the core of the Northtrial make similar allegations.   ``Did you ever instruct North to prepare false answers toCongress?'' he was asked. ``No,'' he said.   McFarlane left government in December 1985, after accompanyingReagan in November to Geneva for the summit meeting with Sovietleader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.   It was in Switzerland, he said, that he got a call from theIsraeli defense minister who was in New York, asking his helpclearing a shipment of U.S.-made Hawk missiles destined for Iran. Hesaid he told Reagan, chief of staff Donald Regan and Secretary ofState George Shultz.   The following May, by then a private citizen, McFarlane said hewent to Tehran at Reagan's request to try to open discussions. Thetrip was a failure.   On the way back during a stop in Israel, ``Colonel North told meI shouldn't be disappointed because some of the proceeds of the sale(of weapons) to Iran was going to be available for the NicaraguanContras,'' McFarlane said.   ``Were you surprised to hear that?'' Keker asked.   ``Yes.''   ``Did you ask anything about it?''   ``No, I should have.''   Earlier, he testified that North prepared a letter McFarlane sentto Congress in 1985 denying that anyone on the National SecurityCouncil staff solicited funds for the Nicaraguan Contras.   Previous witnesses at North's trial _ both private fund-raisersand contributors _ have testified that around that time North gave anumber of briefings emphasizing the needs of the rebels but alwaysleft the room afterward, letting others make the pitch forcontributions.   McFarlane said he was troubled by the draft letter and questionedNorth about it.   ``He said `I believe I have not violated the law,''' McFarlanesaid.   ``He said he had spoken to many groups (and) ... if people said`I want to help,' that in each case he said `I can't be involved'and said go to the Contra office.''   One of the 12 charges against North involves the Sept. 12, 1985,response sent to then-Rep. Michael Barnes, D-Md., who was chairmanof the House subcommittee on western hemisphere affairs. Newspaperstories at the time were reporting some of North's involvement inContra aid and Barnes asked for the facts.   ``None of us has solicited funds, facilitated contacts forprospective potential donors, or otherwise organized or coordinatedthe military or paramilitary efforts of the resistance,'' said theMcFarlane letter. The government charges that North drafted it,knowing it was not true.</TEXT></DOC>
