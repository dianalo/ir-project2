Of course, the foreseen quality assurance and qualitycontrol should be conducted by means of non-destructive techniques. Thiswork presents an over-view of various applicable non-destructive methodsof analysis, showing their fields of investigation in testing waste packages,together with some arising practical problems. The most promising methods,such as eddy current testing, ultrasonic testing, {gamma}-scanning, {gamma}-spectroscopy,neutron counting and computerized tomography, are treated more deeplyand some applications are presented. Particular attention is devotedto the development of a device based on computerized tomography; itsessential components are reported and some design problems are also discussed.35 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
