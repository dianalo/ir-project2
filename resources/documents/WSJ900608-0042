Barrett   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>06/08/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE B3</SO><GV>CONGRESS (CNG)</GV><LP>   WASHINGTON -- Democratic and Republican leaders in theSenate said they will continue efforts to salvage an omnibusanti-crime bill, after a second attempt to limit debate onthe wide-ranging legislation failed.   After private negotiations last night, proponents of thebill said they will try to preserve for a future voteprovisions already fiercely debated on the Senate floor,including a three-year ban on nine types of semi-automatic&quot;assault&quot; weapons, expansion of the federal death penalty,and sharp curbs on constitutional appeals by death-rowinmates.</LP><TEXT>   But George Mitchell, the majority leader, and Robert Dole,the minority leader, emerged from the closed-door session toreport that they didn't have an agreement. Democrats, Mr.Mitchell said, &quot;will review and take a look at&quot; a Republicanproposal to avoid a filibuster that has threatened to killthe entire bill.   Delaware Sen. Joseph Biden, who is managing thelegislation for the Democrats, sounded more optimistic in aseparate press conference. Calling the Republican proposal &quot;aserious effort,&quot; he said, &quot;my gut tells me something willbreak and we will get a bill.&quot;   Among other things, the GOP proposed to strip a measurethat would allow criminal juries in certain instances toconsider unconstitutionally gathered evidence. Mr. Bidenpredicted there would be several days of negotiations beforeany further votes.   Earlier yesterday, Democratic proponents of the bill hadpronounced it dead after the Senate failed for a second timeto limit debate on the legislation. The second vote in favorof a 30-hour debate limit was 57-37, but 60 votes are neededunder Senate rules.   With some 300 amendments pending at that point, debatecould have dragged on indefinitely. Mr. Mitchell had saidthat without a time limit, he would be forced to endconsideration of the bill. That outcome is exactly whatopponents of the gun-control provision, led by the NationalRifle Association, had sought in helping orchestrate theavalanche of amendments.   But South Carolina Sen. Strom Thurmond led a Republicaneffort to save some portion of the crime legislation. In aprivate caucus, GOP leaders agreed to propose to Democratsthat each party be allowed to propose a maximum of 12amendments to the current version of the bill, with apredetermined time limit on debate, Republican aides said.   Another set of noncontroversial amendments might also beadded under the Republican plan, aides said. GOP leadersproposed that the Senate drop consideration of a Bidenproposal to allow certain exceptions to the so-calledexclusionary rule, which bars the use of unconstitutionallygathered evidence in criminal prosecutions. Republicans haveadvocated even broader exceptions to the rule, and the issuewas sure to provoke sharp conflict.   In his news conference, Mr. Biden indicated a willingnessto consider eliminating the exclusionary-rule provision, aswell as his proposal to create a new division for drugs andorganized crime within the Justice Department.   ---   David Rogers contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
