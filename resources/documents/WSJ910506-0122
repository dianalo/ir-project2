But commodity investors have a variety of options, rangingfrom mediation to litigation. And except for litigation, noneof the processes requires an attorney, and most commodityinvestors who press their disputes don't use one.</LP><TEXT>   Commodity-brokerage disputes tend to rise after marketdisruptions. After the 1987 stock-market crash, for instance,arbitration claims concerning losses in stock-index futuresjumped 34% at the National Futures Association, to 406 in1988 from 303 in the year before.   Some commodity-dispute specialists think claims may riseagain this year in the wake of the overnight plunge in oiland gold prices when war broke out in the Persian Gulf. NewYork attorney Bill Singer says he has received a flurry ofcalls recently from investors complaining about brokers whoinduced them to invest in oil futures last fall withassertions that prices were sure to skyrocket if war brokeout.   Many of those investors &quot;just aren't aware that they havemeans of resolving their claims,&quot; Mr. Singer says.   In deciding which alternative to pursue, investors shouldkeep in mind the different risks, costs and potentialbenefits. They should also note that choosing one process maypreclude pursuit through another one later.   Here's a look at the principal alternatives.                                                                                                          MEDIATION. The fastest route to resolving a commoditydispute is through a professional mediator, who helps theparties reach an agreement between themselves. It's usuallypossible to settle a dispute through mediation in under fourmonths.   The biggest advantage, though, is the control the partiesmaintain over the settlement, says Cindy Cain, an NFAadministrator. With other procedures, a third party such asan arbitrator or judge imposes a binding decision.   The American Arbitration Association currently offersmediation services, and the NFA is awaiting approval from theCommodity Futures Trading Commission to offer a program ofits own. The National Association of Securities Dealersoffers mediation for futures disputes if member firms areinvolved.   Costs of using the arbitration association's serviceinclude filing fees of $150 to $850, depending on the size ofthe claim, and the mediator's fee, which usually runs from$300 to $500 a day. There may also be travel expenses,although the association tries to arrange a locationconvenient to the parties.                                                                                                          ARBITRATION. With arbitration, each party presents itsside to an arbitrator or, in some cases, an arbitrationpanel, which renders a final and binding decision. Except inextreme cases, an investor who loses can't press the disputeagain in another forum. Reaching a settlement typically takesunder a year.   The NFA hears most of the commodity arbitration cases, butthe American Arbitration Association and the major futuresexchanges also handle arbitration disputes. The New YorkStock Exchange and NASD can hear commodities cases involvingmember firms.   Of the 850 cases the NFA has heard since the program'sinception in 1983, claimants were awarded monetarycompensation in 67% of the cases. (Many more cases aresettled without being heard by the arbitrators.) At thearbitration association, where about 20% of the securitiesdisputes involve futures, the investor wins some award in 59%of the cases.   Investors don't need to prove a specific rule or law wasbroken in arbitration, only that he or she was damaged by thebroker's actions, says Ms. Cain of the NFA. Most of theclaims filed at the NFA involve allegations of sales-practiceviolations, with the average claim around $20,000.   Philip McBride Johnson, an attorney with Skadden, Arps,Slate, Meagher andamp; Flom in New York and former chairman of theCFTC, says new investors tend to do better than veterans.&quot;It's the new investor who will more likely prevail onarguments like `I didn't understand the risks,'&quot; he says.Experienced traders will have to come forward with somethingmore substantial, such as unauthorized trades or accountchurning, he says.   The costs are similar to those of mediation, except theNFA picks up the costs of its arbitrators and their travel.                                                                                                          REPARATIONS. The CFTC's reparations process is more formalthan arbitration and requires investors to prove that therewere specific violations of the Commodity Exchange Act orCFTC regulations and that the violations directly caused thecustomer's loss. Awards are limited to out-of-pocket losses,with no chance of punitive or other additional awards.   The reparations process attracts more cases than the NFA'sarbitration program, partly because the administrative lawjudges, who hear reparations cases, are perceived to besympathetic to new investors. &quot;The administrative law judgestend to bend over backward to give something to theplaintiff,&quot; says an attorney who mostly works for commodityindustry clients. But he adds that judgments in manyreparation cases are appealed to the commission.   Costs include a filing fee, which ranges from $25 to $200,document copying expenses, and perhaps long-distance phonecall charges -- many reparation hearings are held overconference calls.                                                                                                          LITIGATION. For most investors, going to court just isn'tworth the time and money. It's not unusual for a case to takefive to six years to be resolved, says Mr. Singer, the NewYork attorney who encourages clients to consider arbitration.   Lawsuits also require attorneys, who may demand a part oftheir fees upfront.   Still, it is in court that investors are most likely towin a big-money settlement. And litigation may be the onlyanswer in complex cases, such as those involving charges ofmarket manipulation.   Looking ahead to commodity markets this week:                                                                                                          Grains and Soybeans                                                                                                          The Agriculture Department is slated after the close oftrading Thursday to release its first rough estimate of thisyear's U.S. corn and soybean crops. Some analysts expect thegovernment to predict a relatively large corn harvest and aslight drop in the soybean crop.   Don Roose, an analyst at U.S. Commodities Inc. in DesMoines, Iowa, said he expects the department to forecast acorn harvest of 8.09 billion bushels, up slightly from lastyear's harvest of 7.93 billion bushels.   Mr. Roose said he also expects the government to projectthat about 1.73 billion bushels of that crop will beexported.   The government's forecast will change through the growingseason. The first forecast is primarily based on the numberof acres farmers intend to plant and the assumption of normalyields. Weather conditions greatly change actual yields.   Some analysts are concerned that continued wet weather inthe Midwest might delay planting and reduce the amount oftime the crop has to mature. But it is too early in theseason to trim yield forecasts.   Some analysts also expect the government to project asoybean crop of about 1.89 billion bushels, compared withlast year's harvest of 1.92 billion bushels.   Analysts will be studying the report to see whether thegovernment expects more of the crop to be exported. A poorgrowing season reduced the soybeans that Brazil has availableto export, which could prompt importing nations such as theSoviet Union to shift more business to the U.S. About 540million bushels of last year's U.S. soybean crop wasexported.                                                                                                          Energy                                                                                                          Gasoline futures prices probably will continue to dominatecenter stage in petroleum futures trading this week.Refiners, marketers and traders maintain that U.S.inventories of gasoline, while at historic lows, aren't asdisturbing as they might otherwise be because the recessionin the U.S. has tempered demand. The reality of lower demandhas kept prices from skyrocketing.   Nonetheless, with gasoline stocks as low as they are, thefutures market has become extremely sensitive to refinerydamage reports -- whether rumor or real. Also, traders havetaken to giving special significance to weekly statisticsfrom the American Petroleum Institute, due tomorrow after themarket closes.   Gasoline futures prices rose sharply last week after theAPI report showed that for the third consecutive week, U.S.gasoline stocks were below 205 million barrels, a levelconsidered very low for this time of the year. As far ascrude oil futures prices go, news that production by theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is fallingshould help keep prices firm in the near term.</TEXT></DOC>
