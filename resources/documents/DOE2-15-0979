Therefore, the developmentof a simple and precise model for the estimation of rain acidity fromthe ambient pollutant concentration was performed using the equilibriaof SO{sub 2}-CO{sub 2}-H{sub 2}O and the theory of wet scrubbers, wherethe removal mechanism of pollutants is similar to that of atmosphericpollutants by rain drops. In the validation step, the developed modelwas compared to the equilibrium model. Sensitivity analyses were performedin the range of the conditions of the city of Seoul, Korea, to identifythe important parameters affecting rainwater quality. The identifiedparameters can then be used in the abatement and management of acid rain.</TEXT></DOC>
