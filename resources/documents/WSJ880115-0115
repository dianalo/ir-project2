Mr. Li was arrested Jan. 2 by the Independent Commission Against Corruption, the agency responsible for enforcing Hong Kong's Prevention of Bribery Ordinance. He was released without charge that day and has since been free on bail of 10 million Hong Kong dollars ($1.29 million).    The commission charged Mr. Li under a section of the ordinance, which covers &quot;corrupt transactions&quot; and makes it a criminal offense to accept, solicit or offer an unauthorized advantage. An agency spokeswoman said Mr. Li is to appear in court today, when further details of the charge are expected to be disclosed.    Mr. Li, 58 years old, was exchange chairman until his term expired Dec. 16. At the time of his arrest, he continued to wield considerable influence as a vice chairman of the exchange and a member of its governing committee. But he effectively has been suspended from those duties as a result of the government-initiated management reshuffle.    Mr. Li hasn't commented publicly on the affair. If convicted, he could face seven years in prison and a fine of 500,000 dollars. The ordinance also empowers courts to require the surrender of financial advantages deemed to have been accepted illegally. </TEXT></DOC>
