(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A conservative Christian groupsays it jammed telephone lines at Universal Pictures to protest``The Last Temptation of Christ,'' while another organization hopesto raise $10 million to buy the fictional film of Jesus' life anddestroy it.   Universal received about 10,000 telephone calls Monday inresponse to a drive to flood the studio with messages seeking tostop the distribution of the movie, said Donald E. Wildmon,executive director of the American Family Association.   There was no independent way to confirm Wildmon's statement, butthe main number for MCA Inc., the parent company of UniversalPictures, remained busy throughout Monday. A call to theswitchboard normally goes through.   ``I know that God protects his own reputation, but I feel it'sthe duty of Christians to speak out,'' said Leonard Smith, aSacramento machinist affiliated with the Church of the Nazarene, anevangelical denomination.   Smith said he feared moviegoers might see the film's message asa Christian one, even though director Martin Scorsese hasemphasized the movie is fictional and not based on the Bible. OtherScorsese films include ``Taxi Driver'' and ``Raging Bull.''   The film, based on the 1955 novel of the same name by NikosKazantzakis, depicts a speculative last temptation of a dying JesusChrist, who hallucinates that he abandons his godliness to live asa man and make love to Mary Magdalene.   Those who have seen a rough cut of the movie said Christ thendecides to reject the temptation and fulfill his destiny asredeemer by dying on the cross.   Christian leaders who viewed the film are divided about itsmeaning, while conservative groups who refused to attend ascreening condemned it outright. The movie will be co-distributedby Universal and Cineplex Odeon Films.   A spokesman for Universal refused Monday to comment on ademonstration held Saturday at the studio gates and another plannedfor Wednesday at the home of Universal chairman Lew Wasserman.   ``Opponents of this film are calling for its destruction. Thisis censorship,'' the studio said in a statement. ``People have aright to choose for themselves whether or not to see this movie andform their own opinions about it. ''   The move stars Willem Dafoe as Jesus, Barbara Hershey as MaryMagdalene and Harvey Keitel as Judas Iscariot.   Universal will proceed with plans to distribute the movie inSeptember, the studio spokesman said.   An offer to buy the film for $10 million and destroy it was madeby the San Bernardino-based Campus Crusade for Christ.   The organization, which spreads the Christian gospel on collegeand universities worldwide, said it did not have the money on handbut would gather it through fund-raising.   ``I anticipate that the money will be provided by concernedindividuals across America who will pool their resources in orderto cover your costs,'' evangelist Bill Bright said in a letter sentlate Friday to Wasserman.   ``Dr. Bright's rationale for the letter is in the sprit ofChristian love and forgiveness. He has offered to help pay forUniversal's decision to make a film that demeans Jesus,'' CampusCrusade spokesman Don Beehler said Monday.</TEXT></DOC>
