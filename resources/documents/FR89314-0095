Introduction </ITAG>On September 14, 1987, The New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'')filed with the Commission, pursuant to Section 19(b) of the SecuritiesExchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,\1\<NOTE/> a proposed rule change that would require that a copy ofa member organization's compliance report be furnished annually to themember firm's control persons or, if the member firm has no control persons,to the audit committee of its Board of Directors.\2\<NOTE/> The compliance report is an annual report member firms arerequired to prepare that reviews its supervision and compliance effortsduring the preceding year. The requirement that members produce a compliancereport was part of a package of NYSE rule changes previously approved thatare intended to supplement existing internal compliance procedures of membersand member organizations by imposing additional trade review, inquiry andreporting requirements.\3\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b) and 17 CFR 240.19b-4 (1988). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ The proposed rule change was noticed in Securities ExchangeAct Release No. 25402, February 26, 1988, 53 FR 7272. The Commission receivedone comment letter on the proposal and a response by the NYSE to that comment.<T3>See </T3>discussion at p. 3, <T3>infra</T3>. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ The proposed NYSE rule change (File No. SR-NYSE-87-10)was approved by the Commission in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 25763,May 27, 1988, 53 FR 20925. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Description of Proposed Rule </ITAG>NYSE Rule 342.30 requires that members and member organizations must preparea report on supervisory and compliance efforts undertaken during the previousyear and to submit the report to its chief executive officer or managingpartner by April 1, of each year.\4\<NOTE/> Proposed Rule 354(a) would require that by April 1 of eachyear, each member organization must submit a copy of the annual compliancereport to its one or more control persons as defined under paragraph (b)of the proposed rule.\5\<NOTE/> If the member or member organization has no such controlpersons, it is required to submit a copy of the report to the audit committeeof its Board of Directors or its equivalent committee or group. Where themember organization's control person is an organization (``controllingorganization'') the proposed rule requires the member organization to submitthe report to the general counsel of the controlling organization and tothe audit committee of the controlling organization's Board of Directorsor its equivalent committee or group. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ The report must include a tabulation of customer complaintsand internal investigations, identification and analysis of significantcompliance issues, and plans for future systems or procedures to preventand detect future compliance concerns. Further, the report must includea discussion of the preceding year's compliance efforts in the areas ofantifraud, investment banking, sales practices, books and records, finance,and operations and supervision. <T3>Id</T3>. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ The Commission notes that the NYSE definition of controlperson is applicable solely to the Exchange's rule and may differ fromthe concept of control person under the Act. Proposed Rule 354(b) states that for the purpose of paragraph (a), theterm ``control person'' means a person who controls the member organizationwithin the meaning of NYSE Rule 2\6\<NOTE/> otherwise than solely by virtue of being a director, generalpartner or principal executive officer (or person occupying a similar statusor performing similar functions) of the member organization. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\NYSE Rule 2 defines the term ``control'' as meaning thepower to direct or cause the direction of the management or policies ofa person whether through ownership of securities, by contract, or otherwise.A person is presumed, under the definition in Rule 2, to control anotherperson if such person, directly or indirectly: (1) has the right to vote25% or more of the voting securities; (ii) is entitled to receive 25% ormore of the net profits; (iii) or is a director, general partner or principalexecutive officer (or person occupying a similar status or performing similarfunctions) of the other person. NYSE Rule 2 provides that any person whodoes not own voting securities, participate in profits, or function asa director, general partner or principal executive officer of another personshall be presumed not to control such other person. Under NYSE Rule 2 anypresumption may be rebutted by evidence, but shall continue until a determinationto the contrary has been made by the Exchange. As noted in note 5 <T3>supra, </T3>the NYSE definition of control person is applicable solelyto the Exchange's rule and may differ from the concept of control personunder the Act. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Comments on the Proposed Rule Change </ITAG>The Commission received one comment letter on the proposal. The SecuritiesIndustry Association (``SIA'') submitted a letter critical of the NYSEproposal and urged the Commission not to approve the proposed rule. TheNYSE submitted a letter responding to the SIA's criticisms of its proposal.\7\<NOTE/> These comments are summarized below.\8\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\<T3>See </T3>letters from Dennis H. Greenwald, Chairman, Federal RegulationCommittee, SIA, to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, Commission, dated May 25,1988, and from Edward A. Kwalwasser, Senior Vice President, NYSE, to BrandonBecker, Associate Director, Division of Market Regulation, dated August17, 1988 (``NYSE August 17 letter''). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\Prior to filing the proposed rule with the Commission,the NYSE received two other comment letters, from Prudential-Bache Securities,Inc. (``Prudential-Bache'') and Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc. (``Dean Witter''),that were critical of the proposal. These comments, and the Exchange'sresponse to them, were discussed in the notice of the proposed rule changepublished in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. <T3>See </T3>note 2, <T3>supra</T3>. <ITAG tagnum="28">In brief, Prudential-Bache argued that the proposal would create twoclasses of member organizations (those with and those without control persons)and that the proposal is discriminatory to those member firms with controlpersons. (</ITAG><T3>See </T3>discussion <T3>infra</T3>.) In addition, Prudential-Bache contended that the term``control person,'' as defined under the proposed rule, would include passiveinvestors without regard to the size of their holdings. Therefore, theyargued, submission of reports to control persons may create an obligationnot heretofore in existence. Dean Witter stated that it fully agrees withPrudential-Bache's comments. In addition, Dean Witter stated that it wasconcerned that the proposed rule would negate a control persons' abilityto use the good faith exemption from liability under section 20(a) of theAct. <T3>See </T3>discussion <T3>infra</T3>.) <T3>See </T3>letters from Loren Schechter, Senior Vice President, Prudential-Bache,to David Marcus, Executive Vice President, NYSE, dated May 26, 1987, andfrom Dennis H. Greenwald, Executive Vice President, Dean Witter, to DavidMarcus, Executive Vice President, NYSE, dated June 3, 1987. <ITAG tagnum="28">The NYSE denied that the proposal discriminates against member firmswith control persons and stated that it does not believe that receipt ofthe required compliance reports would negate a control person's abilityto use the good faith defense under section 20(a) of the Act. </ITAG>In its letter the SIA made five principle points in opposition to the NYSEproposal. First, the SIA argues that the proposed NYSE rule will not accomplishany proper purpose. In this regard the SIA states that the proposed rulewould not contribute to the ability of either member organizations or theExchange to prevent or detect securities law or Exchange rule violations.Second, the SIA contends that the proposed rule constitutes an unwarrantedextension of federal regulation to shareholders of a member firm, presumablyby placing a supervisory burden on shareholders classified as control personsor a controlling organization, and thereby interferes with matters relatingto corporate governance properly left to state law. Third, the SIA argues that the proposed NYSE rule is unfair and discriminatory.The SIA states that the proposal creates, in effect, two classes of memberorganizations by requiring only those firms with large stockholders tosubmit their annual compliance report to persons outside their own organization.Fourth, the SIA contends that the proposed requirement that member firmssubmit their annual compliance report to control persons may suggest thata control person assumes the burden to act to correct problems describedin the report. The SIA states that such a suggestion makes a basic changein the role of control persons and argues that such obligations shouldnot be created through adoption of a proposed rule change. Fifth, the SIA believes the proposed rule would make control persons andcontrolling organizations of member firm broker-dealers more vulnerableto civil actions and deprive them of the protections of section 20(a) ofthe Act.\9\<NOTE/> The SIA states that by tying a control person or a controllingorganization into a member broker-dealer's supervisory process, the proposedNYSE rule would make control persons or controlling organizations morevulnerable to unwarranted lawsuits. Moreover, the SIA states that releaseof a member firm's annual compliance report to its controlling organization'saudit committee would increase the possibility that the information inthe report would lose its privilege and thus be subject to discovery ina civil action.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\The concept of controlling persons for purposes of theAct is reflected in section 20(a). Section 20(a) of the Act provides inpertinent part: <ITAG tagnum="28">Every person who, directly or indirectly, controls any person liableunder any provision of this title or of any rule or regulation thereundershall also be liable jointly and severally with and to the same extentas such controlled person to any person to whom such controlled personis liable, unless the controlling person acted in good faith and did notdirectly or indirectly induce the act or acts constituting the violationor cause of action.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">With regard to civil penalties which the Commission can seek to imposeon control persons under the Act, we note that the recently adopted ``InsiderTrading and Securities Fraud Enforcement Act of 1988'' (``ITSFEA''), Pub.L. No. 100-704, 102 Stat. 4677 (1988) added section 21A to the Act whichprovides the Commission the authority to seek civil penalties from personswho have committed insider trading violations under the Act and their controllingpersons (as that term has been applied under the Act). ITSFEA specificallystates that section 20(a) does not apply to controlling person liabilityunder section 21A(a). Instead, the section 20(a) ``good faith'' defensesare replaced by the standard in the new section 21A(b)(1) which providesthat no control person shall be subject to a civil penalty under this sectionunless the Commission establishes that:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">(A) Such controlling person knew or recklessly disregarded the factthat such controlled person was likely to engage in the act or acts constitutingthe violation and failed to take appropriate steps to prevent such actor acts before they occurred; or</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">(B) Such controlling person knowingly or recklessly failed to establish,maintain, or enforce any policy or procedure required under section 15(f)of [the Act] or section 204A of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 andsuch failure substantially contributed to or permitted the occurrence ofthe act or acts constituting the violation.</ITAG>In its August 17 letter, the NYSE responded to the SIA's concerns and objectionsto the proposed rule change. First, the Exchange denies that the proposalwould not accomplish a proper purpose. The NYSE states that the proposedrule would require control persons or a controlling organization to benotified of the member firm's supervision and compliance efforts and ofany significant problems that may have developed and the steps plannedto alleviate those problems. The NYSE believes that by providing the controllingorganization with the member firm's annual compliance report, the probabilitythat prompt attention will be given by the member firm to resolving itssignificant compliance problems will be enhanced.Second, the Exchange disputes the SIA's contention that the proposed rulerepresents an unwarranted extension of federal regulation to shareholdersof a member firm and interferes with matters relating to corporate governanceunder state law. The NYSE states that the proposed rule merely requiresthat certain information be made available to control persons. The Exchangeargues that this information is relevant to the control person's investmentand enables the control person, if it sees fit, to respond as it deemsappropriate to the information provided in the report. The Exchange comparesthe requirement that the annual compliance report be submitted to controlpersons or a controlling organization to requirements that a subsidiaryperiodically report on its financial condition and operations to its parentcompany. The NYSE believes that the subsidiary's ability to operate ina fashion that permits it to comply with the rules of the Exchange shouldbe of significant interest and importance to the parent.Third, the NYSE disagrees with the SIA's contention that the proposed rulechange creates two classes of member organizations and that it is unfairand discriminatory. The Exchange states that the intention of the proposedrule is to place the annual compliance report into the hands of personswho are in a position to exert influence on the member to take necessarycorrective action to remedy problems discussed in the report. The NYSEargues that the report should be sent to these persons irrespective ofwhether such persons exist outside the member organization, and that thereis nothing unfair or discriminatory in this requirement.Fourth, the NYSE disputes the SIA's contention that the proposed rule placesa burden on control persons to correct problems that may be described inthe report. The Exchange states that the proposed rule simply assures thatcontrol persons will be supplied with the report. The control person remainsfree to take no steps whatsoever or any steps it may deem appropriate withrespect to the contents of the report. The Exchange presumes, however,that the control persons will be as concerned with the member firm's compliancewith NYSE rules as they will be about other aspects of the member's firm'soperations.Fifth, the NYSE asserts that the SIA's claim that the proposal will makecontrol persons or controlling organizations more vulnerable to lawsuitsis highly speculative. The Exchange also disagrees with the SIA's assertionthat receipt of this report by control persons would deprive them of thegood faith defense under section 20(a) of the Act of that release of thereport to control persons would increase the chance that the report wouldlose any privilege it may have from being subject to discovery in the courseof civil litigation.The Exchange argues that the proposed rule creates no obligation or responsibilityon the part of the control person, but simply provides them with informationthe NYSE believes they should receive. Moreover, the Exchange contendsthat the requirement might enable control persons to document that theyacted in good faith upon receipt of the report, thus providing insulationfrom civil liability. For example, if a control person acted to increasetheir member firm's supervision and compliance areas after receipt of sucha report, those actions could demonstrate a control person's good faithefforts. In this way, the NYSE asserts that the proposed rule change couldenhance a control person's ability to use the good faith defense undersection 20(a) of the Act.With regard to the possible loss of privilege from discovery of the annualcompliance report, the NYSE states that it is unclear that the report wouldbe entitled to any privilege from discovery in civil litigation even ifit remained within the member firm. Moreover, the Exchange notes that thereport does not need to be prepared in a way that should increase the exposureof the control persons or the member firm to civil liability. The NYSEstated that identification and analysis of compliance problems requiredin the report only needs to be done in a generic manner and that specificidentification of the incident or the parties involved is not necessaryunless warranted by the facts.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Discussion</ITAG>The Commission has reviewed closely the proposed NYSE rule change, thecomments received by the Commission and the Exchange in opposition to theproposal, and the NYSE's response to those comments. On the basis of thisreview, the Commission has concluded that the proposed NYSE rule changeis consistent with the requirements of the Act and, accordingly, shouldbe approved.In particular, the Commission believes that the proposed rule is consistentwith sections 6(b)(1) and 19(g)(1)(A) of the Act, which require that nationalsecurities exchanges must ensure member and member organization compliancewith the Act, its rules, and the rules of the exchange. The requirementthat a copy of the member firm's annual compliance report be provided tocontrol persons, its controlling organization, or to the audit committeeon the member firm's Board of Governors is a proper means to promote thegoals of the compliance procedures imposed by SR-NYSE-87-10. The Commission,when approving SR-NYSE-87-10, stated that the annual report requirementin NYSE Rule 342.30 will improve significantly the compliance efforts ofmember organizations by ensuring that the chief executive officer or managingpartner of the member firm focuses sufficient attention on supervisoryand compliance obligations. The Commission believes that the requirementthat the annual compliance report be provided to a member's control personsor controlling organization is an additional method of providing thesepersons with the information necessary to evaluate the compliance proceduresof the member. While the proposed rule does not, in and of itself, obligatecontrol persons to take any action upon receipt of the report, it doesensure that they will be notified of the supervisory and compliance situationof their member firm.  The Commission recognizes that a control person's obligation to act uponthe information contained in its member firm's annual compliance reportmust be viewed in light of provisions governing control person liabilityunder the Act. As noted previously, control persons are subject to liabilityunder section 20(a) unless they acted in good faith and did not directlyor indirectly induce the act or acts constituting the violation or causeof action. In addition, under the new Section 21A the Commission can seekto impose civil penalties on control persons for insider trading violationscommitted by their controlled person or organization: (1) Where the controlperson knew or recklessly disregarded the fact that the controlled personwas likely to engage in such acts and failed to take steps to prevent suchactions; or (2) where the control person knowingly or recklessly failedto establish, maintain, or enforce any policy or procedure required underSection 19(f) of the Act or Section 204A of the Investment Advisers Actof 1940 and such failure substantially contributed to or permitted theoccurrence of the act or acts constituting the violation.\1\\0\<NOTE/> In view of these standards for control person liability,the Commission believes it is likely that control persons will be and shouldbe as concerned with the member firm's compliance with the requirementsof the Act, its rules, and with NYSE rules, as they would be about otheraspects of the member firm's operations and that, as a consequence, theprobability that prompt attention will be given by the member firm to resolvingsignificant compliance issues will be enhanced. For these reasons, theCommission also believes that the proposed rule change is consistent withsection 6(b)(5) of the Act which requires that the rules of an exchangebe designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices,to promote just and equitable principles of trade, and to protect investorsand the public interest. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\<T3>See</T3> discussion <T3>infra</T3>.  Concerning the specific objections to the proposed rule change raised incomment letters received by the Commission and the NYSE, for the reasonsset forth below the Commission does not believe these objections warrantinstituting proceedings to consider disapproving the proposed rule change.The Commission believes that the intent of the proposed rule, to increasethe probability that prompt attention will be provided by member firmsto resolving significant compliance issues by providing copies of the firm'sannual compliance report to control persons, is plainly a proper purposeunder sections 6(b)(1) and 19(g)(1)(A) of the Act.  The proposed rule also does not represent an unwarranted extension of federalregulation interfering with corporate governance areas under state law.Sections 6(b)(1) and 19(g)(1)(A) require that the rules of a national securitiesexchange must ensure member and member organization compliance with theAct, its rules, and the rules of the exchange. As stated above, the intentionof the proposed rule is to increase the probability that NYSE member firmswill monitor their compliance procedures. The rule change does not alter,restrict, or impose conditions on the corporate structure of member firmsor their control persons. To comply with the rule change, an NYSE memberwould not have to make any changes to its corporate structure. In addition,the proposed rules does not impose any new obligation on control personsto respond to the report.\1\\1\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\1\<T3>See</T3> discussion <T3>infra.</T3>  Furthermore, the Commission disagrees that the proposed rule is unfairand discriminatory and that it creates two classes of member firms. Theproposed rule merely requires that member firms submit copies of theirannual compliance report to control persons or a controlling organizationwhere such persons or organization exists. The Commission finds nothingunfair or discriminatory in that requirement. Moreover, the fact that afirm's control person might be a large, outside shareholder does not placeany special requirement or burden on that firm. The NYSE believes it hasset the share ownership level for control high enough_25%_to capture shareholderswith such a substantial stake in the company that they would be in a positionto exert influence or direction over the member's operations.\1\\2\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\2\NYSE Rule 2, which defines the term ``control'' providesthat any presumption of control under the rule may be rebutted by evidence,but shall continue until a determination to the contrary has been madeby the Exchange. <T3>See</T3> note 5, <T3>supra.</T3>The Commission also can find no basis to sustain commentators' claims thatthe proposed rule will deprive them of the good faith defense under section20(a) of the Act or increase the potential that the report would be subjectto discovery. A control person who receives a report pursuant to the rulemay still assert the defense under section 20(a), where applicable, ina subsequent civil action and attempt to meet the burden of showing goodfaith and non-inducement of the acts constituting the violation or causeof action. It should be recognized, in this regard, that section 20(a)of the Act does not, and was not intended to, provide a blanket exemptionfrom control persons from civil liability. Rather, on its face, it extendsjoint and several liability to control persons for the violations of personsthat they directly or indirectly control, except where the control personacted in good faith and did not directly or indirectly induce the violation.In the normal case, the mere receipt of a compliance document identifyingminor compliance problems and the actions taken to address any complianceweaknesses would in no way eliminate the controlling person's good faithdefense. In the extraordinary case, where the report indicates seriousproblems and an absence of any effective response by the firm, it wouldappear consistent with the purposes underlying the statute to expect thecontrol person to respond.\13\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\13\ Vicarious liability may also be imposed on control personsunder respondeat superior, to which the ``good faith'' defense of Section20(a) would not apply. The Second, Fourth, Fifth Sixth and Seventh Circuitshave held that control person provisions under the Act and the SecuritiesAct of 1933 are not the exclusive means by which vicarious liability canbe imposed and that liability may also be imposed under agency principles_respondeatsuperior. <T3>See, e.g., Paul F. Newton andamp; Company</T3> v. <T3>Texas Commerce Bank, </T3>630 F.2d 1111 (5th Cir. 1980); <T3>Marbury Management, Inc. </T3> v. <T3>Kohn,</T3> 629 F.2d, 705 (2nd Cir. 1980): <T3>Halloway </T3>v. <T3>Howerdd,</T3> 536 F.2d 690 (6th Cir. 1976); <T3>Fey </T3>v. <T3>Walston andamp; Co., </T3> 493 F.2d 1036 (7th Cir. 1974); <T3>Johns Hopkins University</T3> v. <T3>Hutton,</T3> 422 F.2d 1124 (4th Cir. 1970), <T3>cert. denied,</T3> 416 U.S. 916 (1974). The Third and Ninth Circuitshave held that a control person's vicarious liability under the Act mayonly be determined under Section 20(a) and that agency principles_respondeatsuperior_may not be used. See, e.g., <T3>Rochez Brothers</T3> v. <T3>Rhoads, </T3>,527 F.2d 880 (3rd Cir. 1975); <T3>Zweig v. Hearst Corp., </T3>521 F.2d 1129 (9th Cir.), <T3>cert. denied,</T3> 423 U.S. 1025 (1975).Similarly, under the newly adopted section 21A of the Act\14\<NOTE/> the Commission may seek to impose civil penalties on controlpersons based on insider trading violations by their controlled personor organization where the control person knew or recklessly disregardedthe fact that the controlled person was likely to engage in the act oracts constituting the violation and failed to take appropriate steps toprevent such acts, or where the control person knowingly or recklesslyfailed to establish, maintain, or enforce any policy or procedure requiredunder section 15(f) of the Act, or section 204A of the Investment AdvisorsAct of 1940, and that failure substantially contributed to or permittedthe violation.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\14\ <T3>See</T3> note 8, <T3>supra.</T3>The proposed NYSE rule change requiring submission of an annual compliancereport to a control person (as defined by the NYSE) will not alter a controlperson's obligations under the Act. The Commission recognizes that thereport could be a factor in determining a control person's civil liabilityunder section 20(a), or the imposition of civil penalties by the Commissionunder section 21A, as a result of violations of the controlled person.In the Commission's view, however, any civil liability for control personswhich arises under section 20(a) as a result of the determination thata control person's actions were not in good faith and that they directlyor indirectly induced the acts constituting the violation is consistentwith the purposes of the Act. Similarly, in any case where the Commissionseeks to impose civil penalties on a control person under section 21A basedon a determination that the control person knew or recklessly disregardedinformation that their controlled person was likely to take actions constitutinga violation and failed to take steps to prevent them, or where the controlperson knowingly or recklessly failed to establish, maintain, or enforceprocedures and such failure substantially contributed to or permitted theviolation, based on the control person's knowledge of information containedin the report, such liability is appropriate and fully consistent withthe objectives of ITSFEA to increase management and supervisory effortsto prevent insider trading.Finally, the Commission believes that submission of the member firm's annualcompliance report to control persons would have no impact on the questionof whether a member firm's annual compliance report would be eligible forprivilege from discovery. Although the SIA comment letter was not specificon this point, we presume that the SIA was referring to discovery conductedunder Rule 26 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and to the potentialapplication of the attorney ``work product'' privilege from such discoveryunder the Rule. The work product privilege from discovery applies to materialgenerated for use in litigation.\15\<NOTE/> The work product privilege does not, however, apply to reportsprepared in the regular course of business.\16\<NOTE/> Under NYSE Rule 342.30 NYSE member firms are required toprepare an annual compliance report and provide it to their firm's chiefexecutive officer. In addition, members firms are required, upon the Exchange'srequest, to make the report available to the NYSE.\17\<NOTE/> In view of this, the Commission concurs with the NYSE thatit is not at all clear that such a report would be eligible for work productprivilege from discovery under any circumstances. The Commission does notbelieve that the additional requirement that the report also be distributedto a member firm's control persons will affect its eligibility for thework product privilege.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\15\ <T3>See</T3> generally, <T3>Hickman </T3>v. <T3>Taylor,</T3> 329 U.S. 495 (1947).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\16\ <T3>See, e.g., United States </T3>v. <T3>Gulf Oil Corp.,</T3> 760 F.2d 292, 296-297 (Temp.
