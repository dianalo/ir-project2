RoschandM;Two Ps predominate when pondering the compatibilities of color printers:PostScript and Pantone.andM;Together, these two standards help ensure that a given printer will have thewidest font options available and colors that can be accurately transferredto other printing processes.andM;PostScript, the page-description language developed by Adobe Systems Inc., ofMountain View, Calif., is a widely accepted standard in the graphic-artsindustry because it allows the use of a wide variety of output devices withvarying resolutions.andP;  The output of one PostScript machine will match that ofany other, outside of the limits imposed by the individual devices'resolutions.andM;There are other printer standards that allow for scalable fonts, butPostScript holds an important advantage in color printing.andM;&quot;While there are other emerging font standards, such as TrueType, PostScriptis the only one that supports color standards accepted throughout theindustry,&quot; said Terry Harbin, manager of electronic-publishing systems forQMS Inc., a Mobile, Ala., manufacturer of PostScript printers.andP;  &quot;Otherpage-description standards that are emerging are basically monochromestandards.&quot;andM;Noel Traver, owner of Amber Productions, a graphic-design and productionhouse and color service bureau in Columbus, Ohio, counts PostScript as theNo.andP;  1 issue when selecting a thermal printer.andM;&quot;PostScript compatibility is the first and foremost consideration,&quot; he said.andO;&quot;The color output that we generate is typically used for proofing or mockingup printed material, typically typeset.andP;  Consequently, the ability to displayfonts accurately is important to us.&quot;andM;PostScript was designed primarily for the publishing industry, so its mostimportant feature is one that those dealing with typography find mostimportant -- fonts.andM;By handling characters as mathematically defined shapes instead of bitimages, PostScript allows a single font description to be scaled to any size.andO;Not only can fonts be stored more efficiently, but typographers also need notbe limited to standard font sizes.andM;This versatility has made PostScript the top choice in text-based PC graphicsapplications.andM;&quot;PostScript is popular for applications that are related to graphic arts, andwhere the image that you are creating will eventually become part of apublication,&quot; explained C. Stan Perkins, marketing manager of small-formatprinters for Calcomp Inc., a manufacturer of computer graphics peripheralsbased in Anaheim, Calif.andM;&quot;Today, PostScript is not commonly used in IBM-format presentation graphics,&quot;Perkins said.andM;However, that situation is changing.andM;The designers of presentation-graphics programs have discovered the power ofPostScript's scalable fonts and are incorporating it into their products.andP;  Agrowing number of presentation-graphics packages now offer PostScriptsupport.andM;&quot;The many choices of fonts and type sizes is why PostScript is sneaking intopresentation graphics,&quot; Perkins added.andM;PostScript compatibility has become such a major issue in printing that somemakers of color thermal printers have discovered that selling productswithout PostScript abilities is near impossible.andM;When it comes to thermal wax color printers, &quot;if it's notPostScript-compatible, they don't want it,&quot; said Gary Armstrong Jr., vicepresident of marketing and sales for Computer Image Products Inc., amanufacturer of color printers in Reston, Va.andM;While PostScript gives thermal wax printers versatility, Pantone gives themaccuracy.andM;Pantone refers to the color-matching system that Pantone Inc. licenses toensure that a color produced on one device, or through one means, will matchthat of another as closely as possible.andM;Most users see Pantone as the one reliable standard in color specificationand require it in their color printing products.andM;&quot;We need Pantone for color accuracy,&quot; said Amber Productions' Traver.andO;&quot;Pantone is the most common standard.andP;  Without it, the customer won't get afair rendering of what to expect in a finished product.&quot;andM;Pantone, of Moonachie, N.J., has developed two different systems of colorstandards widely used in a variety of industries.andP;  Adhering to Pantonestandards assures a true color match from the designer's first idea to thefinished product, whether it be on printed page or woven fabric.andM;The foundation of the Pantone system is little more than a chart of colors.andO;The company then determines how a given product or process can most closelymatch the standard colors in that chart.andP;  This match assures that the outputof a color thermal wax printer used to make a mock-up, for example, willmatch the final product that's conventionally printed on an offset press.andM;&quot;We match as best as possible each Pantone color -- color by color,&quot;explained Richard Herbert, director of computer technologies for Pantone.andM;&quot;It's as close as you can possibly get on each device.andP;  When a designer usessoftware that supports Pantone on a matching thermal printer, he sees thebest representation of the colors he wants as possible,&quot; Herbert said.andM;Unlike the scientifically defined shapes that make up PostScript characters,the Pantone system has a more subjective basis because of the essentiallyartistic nature of color matching.andM;&quot;We don't use mathematical equations,&quot; said Herbert.andP;  &quot;We tweak each color sothat it is as close as possible to a Pantone color.andP;  The ultimatedetermination is the eye.andP;  Machines don't always tell the truth.&quot;andM;Of course, not all applications require an exact color match or a widevariety of typefaces and sizes.andM;Even in these situations, though, compatibility remains a major issue inchoosing a color thermal printer.andP;  The printer must be compatible with thesoftware with which it is used, especially when it is designed to work bestwith particular applications.andM;&quot;Make sure the printer you select will be compatible or will connect to theplatform and software you plan to use,&quot; advised Perkins.andM;&quot;There are a number of thermal printers on the market, and each tends to haveits own niche because it has the right connectivity,&quot; Perkins added.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
