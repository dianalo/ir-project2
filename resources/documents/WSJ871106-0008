The companies that are most likely to take such actions, the consultants say, are ones where employees can put money into a fund that invests only in the company's own stock, and where the company's stock price has dropped sharply. Many of the nation's largest corporations have such employee stock funds.    The companies are not attempting to make up for the decline in the value of their stocks. Consultants say the firms, however, are considering making up for losses that are at least partly the result of normal delays in processing withdrawals.    Interviews with more than 20 major companies that have such funds indicate that some commonly followed procedures for allowing employees to withdraw money could have resulted in losses to employees still in the funds after the Oct. 19 market crash. The companies won't admit publicly they are considering any actions.    The losses came when fund trustees were forced to sell shares at depressed prices to meet redemption orders, the consultants say. At many companies, they say, orders placed during a particular month aren't executed until three or four weeks after month's end.    At some funds, employees who placed sell orders in September received cash based on the fund's value as of Sept. 30, but the actual shares weren't sold until after Oct. 19, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 508 points. As a result, employees still in the fund saw the value of their investment further diminished.    &quot;There are some very real and tough questions dealing with whether the employer steps in and makes good on some of those losses,&quot; says Michael Footer, a principal in the Richmond, Va., office of William M. Mercer-Meidinger-Hansen. &quot;Quite a number of companies have the problem,&quot; Mr. Footer says. &quot;I know of a couple where it's substantive.&quot;    Employers are particularly concerned when such losses result from their own administrative procedures. Donald W. Hasbargen, a partner in the Minneapolis office of Hewitt Associates, says he knows of two firms that have already decided to cover such losses. &quot;They're not going to have people who stayed in (the company stock fund) paying the price for the people who got out at an opportune time,&quot; Mr. Hasbargen says. The companies don't want to be publicly identified, he says.    &quot;It's a hot issue right now and a painful one,&quot; Mr. Hasbargen says. But using corporate cash to prop up a company stock fund could raise questions about compensating for future losses in other types of funds, he notes.    Some companies apparently avoided having to face such decisions largely by luck. A Champion International Corp. spokesman says employees in the company's saving plan may have to absorb losses &quot;because of the fluctuation of the value of the plan holdings.&quot; He says, however, that such losses are expected to be small because redemptions in September were low, and they won't be made up by Stamford, Conn.-based Champion.    Two of the largest companies with such funds, General Electric Co. and General Motors Corp., say they avoided such administrative losses because they have little or no lag between redemptions and stock sales.    At American Express Co., New York, the September redemptions from the company-stock fund were unusually high, says Stephen Norman, corporate secretary. However, he says, cash flow into the fund from employees' payroll deductions and regular company contributions was enough to meet redemption orders without having to sell shares into the falling market.    Mr. Norman and others suggest that September redemptions from company-stock funds may have been higher than normal because many employees follow their company's stock price closely and sensed a market top. &quot;The employees watch the market. They've seen the stock rising year after year, and when it's high, they'll shift into something more conservative,&quot; Mr. Norman says.    Benefits consultants also expect that many employers soon will re-examine their rules governing investments in and withdrawals from such funds in light of the stock market's increased volatility.    &quot;We're into a whole new look at how those funds are going to be administered because nobody anticipated that kind of volatility,&quot; says Harold Dankner, a partner in the Washington office of Coopers andamp; Lybrand. </TEXT></DOC>
