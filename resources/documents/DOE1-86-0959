<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-86-0959 </DOCNO><TEXT>A Monte Carlo computer calculation is described which models the geometricefficiency of a fiber-scintillator flow-cell radiation detector designedto detect radiolabeled compounds in liquid chromatography eluates. Byusing special mathematical techniques, an efficiency prediction witha precision of 1% is obtained after generating only 1000 random events.Good agreement is seen between predicted and experimental efficiencyexcept for very low energy beta emission where the geometric limitationon efficiency is overcome by pulse height limitations which the modeldoes not consider. The modeling results show that in the test system,the detection efficiency for low energy beta emitters is limited primarilyby light generation and collection rather than geometry.</TEXT></DOC>
