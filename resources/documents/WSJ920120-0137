Despite such fears, the population has been surprisinglyquiescent since the drastic Jan. 2 price increases.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Nothing extraordinary has happened yet,&quot; says AndreiNechaev, Russia's first deputy economics minster, whotraveled with President Boris Yeltsin on a recent tour ofRussian cities. &quot;Our worst fears haven't been realized.&quot;   In Tashkent, the capital of the central Asian nation ofUzbekistan, consumer disgruntlement turned deadly Friday asuniversity students took to the streets to protest higherfood prices and a shortage of bread. According to Russiannews accounts, troops and police ordered to disperse thestudents shot and killed at least two protesters and injureddozens more. Authorities tried to calm the situation byclosing schools until Feb. 10, though a tense standoffremains.   The tragedy in Tashkent may well portend similar protestselsewhere. Yet observers in Moscow thus far have been struckby the relative patience of the citizenry. Prices for mostgoods have vaulted skyward this winter. In Moscow, breadprices are up 3.5 times, butter has gone up five to sixtimes, while prices of sausage are as much as 10 timesearlier levels. Most frustrating of all, despite the higher,market-driven prices, which are meant to spur greaterproduction, shortages of many goods persists.   While there is a strong sense of unhappiness amongconsumers, many seem willing to hunker down. &quot;It has becomeextremely difficult to live,&quot; says Sergei Kirov, a taxidriver in Moscow. &quot;But I'm willing to put up with hardshiptoday if it means that things will get better tomorrow.&quot;   The Russian government remains worried that labor groupswill call for widespread strikes to protest worseningeconomic conditions. So far, though, workers by and largehave kept working. The Russian Federation of IndependentTrade Unions had called for mass disobedience around thecountry Friday, though there were virtually no significantprotests, according to the Russian Interfax news agency.   Miners in the Kuzbass coal fields in Siberia, who havefrequently been at the forefront of protest strikes in recentyears, held brief rallies Friday but are continuing to work,Interfax reported. By contrast, last April, when thegovernment pushed through an earlier round of price rises,Kuzbass miners went on strike, shutting down more than 50 ofthe region's mines and demanding the resignation ofthen-Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev. There have, however,been work slowdowns this month at mines in Kazakhstan and inthe Donbass region of Ukraine.   In Moscow, leftist opponents of Mr. Yeltsin have organizeddemonstrations the past two weekends. The rallies, in whichprotesters have carried posters of former Soviet leadersLenin, Khrushchev and even Stalin, have been instructive,disclosing that there are many Russians who fear the neweconomic reforms and who pine for the days when society wasmore orderly and prices were low. Still, such sentimentsappear to remain on the fringe so far.   Beyond the economic turmoil, the attitude of the militaryis a critical question mark on the survival of the newCommonwealth of Independent States. On Friday, some 5,000military officers from all over the former Soviet Union metin Moscow in an extraordinary congress. Coming after thecontroversial price rises and as several leaders of the newCommonwealth had proposed breaking up the former Sovietmilitary, there was talk of a rebellion in the ranks. Rumorseven surfaced that another coup might be imminent.   At the start of the meeting, the head of the commonwealthforces, Marshal Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, called for calm,telling the armed forces that they represent the &quot;last borderon the path to final disintegration of the country, the lastboundary beyond which chaos and tragedy are possible.&quot;   After a day of stormy discussion, which was broadcast livethroughout the commonwealth, relative calm prevailed. Theofficers adopted a resolution calling for the army to remainunited. In an attempt to cool the air, Mr. Shaposhnikovdeclared that the military forces &quot;are not going either tooust any leader or bring any politician to power.&quot;   Despite weathering the first 17 days of life under afree-market system, the Russian government is bracing forfurther unrest. Mr. Yeltsin, who enjoyed tremendouspopularity after successfully resisting the failed coup lastAugust, now concedes that &quot;the applause has died down.&quot;   Says Mr. Nechaev, Mr. Yeltsin's deputy economics minister,&quot;We are holding our breath.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
