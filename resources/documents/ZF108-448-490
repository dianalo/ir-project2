Andy Redfernasked two software houses to explain what, if anything, they find the mostuseful.andM;Unquestionably, the last decade was the era of personal computing.andP;  Thepundits are now predicting what the 90s have in store for us all.andP;  Stevejobs, founder of NexT Inc, recently predicted that it will be the decade of'interpersonal computing'.andP;  Software will be replaced by groupware.andP;  Standalone PCs will be networked.andP;  The whole office environment will be gearedtowards information and communication.andP;  But what effect will this have on theprogrammers who develop the software?andM;Through the media and by word of mouth, the legendary programmer is portrayedhuddled over his computer keyboard.andP;  He works alone and at night.andP;  Of course,like all myths there is an element of truth in such a picture, but today'sprogrammer is often a professional who works as part of a development team.andO;Interpersonal computing' or networking would seem to offer benefits for boththe development team and the users of the end product.andP;  But do the benefitsoutweigh the disadvantages of cost and loss of individuality? Are thereenough network products to provide software developers with the specialisttools that they need?andM;In search of the answers to these questions, I talked to two very different,but equally successful UK software houses - Intuitive Systems in Stevenage,and Zortech in Woolwich.andM;Intuitive SystemsandM;Over the last five years, the team of six programmers at Intuitive Systemshave developed a range of database products.andP;  Their products are aimed at thecorporate PC network environment and, therefore, they needed to install anetwork to ensure that their final product actually worked.andP;  The Company havesince discovered that the network also plays an important role in theefficiency of their development work itself.andM;All the PCs used by the team are networked using 3Com Etherlink cards.andP;  Thenetwork unusually supports two servers - one running Novell Netware and theother running OS/2 LAN Manager - over the same cabling.andP;  As a machine bootsonto the network, the user can select which server to use depending on whichoperating system they are using.andM;All of the development work is done in the Glockenspiel C++ translator usingthe Microsoft C compiler.andP;  All C++ and C header files, compiler support filesand libraries are stored on the remote server.andP;  This allows a single backupof all the development work to be taken regularly, using a single tapestreamer.andP;  Before the network was installed, one tape streamer was shared bythe whole team.andP;  Naturally, this involved a considerable amount of time beingwasted installing and un-installing the streamer, just to make backups ofeach person's hard disk.andM;ProblemsandM;The biggest problem in having only one copy of all the files on the server ishow to control the use and modification of the files by six differentprogrammers.andP;  Andy Bowyer, Project Leader at Intuitive Systems, chosePolytron's version control software PolyPVCS and their network MAKE utility,PolyMake.andP;  'Initially, we all worked completely off the networked drives -headers, source, libraries and EXE files were all called from the remotedrives.andP;  The only problem with that was that the MAKE process sloweddramatically as the network traffic increased.andP;  We now use PolyPVCS to bookout source and header files, and keep the copies on our local hard disks.andO;This speeds up the MAKE process quite dramatically.'andM;The documentation for their products is also produced on the network usingMicrosoft Word for OS/2.andP;  This allows the programmer who created the relevantsection of the product to document it directly in a single copy of themanual.andP;  The network is also used to give everyone access to the printingresources, but the other network buzzword, email, has failed to impress anyof the development team.andM;Running the two networks side by side has given Intuitive Systems aninteresting insight into how the two products compare with each other.andP;  LANManager's biggest problem seems to be speed - it provides an average accesstime of little more than twice the speed of a floppy disk.andP;  But theadvantages of LAN Manager for a software developer are significant.andP;  Writinga server application under Netware is possible, but all the routines,protocols and techniques used are proprietary, making porting the software toanother network difficult.andP;  Using LAN Manager it is a relativelyuncomplicated process.andP;  In fact, it is similar enough in operation to UNIXthat transferring servers between the two environments is an elementary task.andO;Also the server's standard interface means that users of the IntuitiveSolution product can not only gain access to their data using Intuitive's ownserver, but also through IBM and Sybase's SQL servers.andP;  A distinct advantagefor gaining access to the IBM-dominated corporate arena.andM;Everything sounds too good to be true? Andy Bowyer admits there aredisadvantages.andP;  'If the server crashes, or fails to boot in the morning, noone can do any work until it's sorted out.andP;  Crashes are less frequent withLAN Manager than with Netware, but they still occur and it affects everyonewhen they do'.andP;  Obviously, this problem has been lessened to some extent bythe introduction of PolyPVCS for booking out files to local drives.andM;ZortechandM;The very fact that Zortech has grown as a company-pays tribute to thedramatic advances in communication and network technology.andP;  Zortech's headoffice may well be in Woolwich, but technical support is in Yorkshire, one ofthe support programmers operates from Grantham, most of the documentation iswritten in Hertfordshire, the US office is based in Boston, while WalterBright, the creator of Zortech C and C++, works at the opposite end of theStates in Seattle.andP;  Without an excellent communication structure the companywould be strangled by delays, and products not being in the right place atthe right time.andM;All the PCs in the Woolwich and Boston offices are networked together using aNovell system.andP;  These networks run all their accounts and word processing,and are used in the production of the compiler documentation.andP;  On both sidesof the Atlantic, Zortech use Sage Multi-user Accounts for its simplicity andthe excellent reporting facilities it provides.andM;It all sounds very sensible and fairly mundane until John Haggins, ManagingDirector of Zortech, begins to wax lyrical about the email system they use.andO;We use an electronic mail&quot; system called Coordinator 2 from ActionTechnologies in the States.andP;  It provides a message service for everyone onthe two networks, and for all those who work from home'.andM;Basically, Coordinator 2 can either run on a networked system or on a standalone machine, transmitting the messages across the network links or througha modem as needed.andP;  For example, if someone in Head Office wants to send amessage to Walter in Seatle, they simply enter the message and address it tohim.andP;  The UK system will then automatically dial the Boston office andtransfer the message across.andP;  At a later time, Walter would dial into theBoston server using the stand alone version of Coordinator, and download allhis messages.andP;  Then, while off line, he can prepare replies to the messagesand log on once more to the Boston system to send them.andM;John Haggins continues, 'It's amazing, I don't have to repeat myself anymore.andP;  If I have an interesting phone call that the US Managing Director andothers should hear about, I simply mail him and send copies to everyone else.andO;The system even allows us to attach files to the messages'.andM;In the Summer and Autumn of 1989, Zortech set themselves a difficultchallenge - to turn the specification of C++ version 2 from a paper documentin june, to a finished shrink wrapped product in November.andP;  Haggins claimsthat one of the main reasons that was possible was through using the emailsystem.andP;  'Even though we were 8000 miles apart, it was like Walter was in theoffice next door.andP;  The only reason that the November shipment date was met,was because of the communications technology we employed.'andM;More ProblemsandM;Of course, the system isn't perfect.andP;  If a message and six copies are sent topeople in the States, then the same message is transmitted across theAtlantic seven times.andP;  If a file is attached, that gets sent seven times aswell.andP;  This is symptomatic of the main problems facing network users - theutility and specialist software that is so abundant on the stand alone PCjust isn't available on network systems yet.andP;  Special tasks have to bewritten by yourself, or not done at all.andM;For example, Sage Multi-user Accounts, like most network software, employsfile locking because it's simpler than the more efficient record locking.andO;This means that a network user will regularly be denied access to a filebecause someone else is using it.andP;  Worse than that, it's often impossible tofind out exactly who is using it.andP;  So frustrated were the staff on thenetwork that, in the end, one of the team wrote a little pop-up utilitycalled  Who's got it?'.andM;In another instance, a utility was written to send a copy of the day'strading to the States.andP;  John Haggins maintains that it is a worthwhileproduct to use, and it certainly saves him time, but it just isn't costeffective to write that kind of software yourself.andM;There's a tremendous opportunity out there for someone to write someexcellent network products.andP;  The problem is either that people are not doingit, or the dealer/distributor network is not taking on such products.'andM;ConclusionandM;On balance, it would appear that networks do provide benefits for softwaredevelopers and their support teams who market the products they write.andO;Networked version control software and MAKE utilities are obviously a realbonus and, in the distributed company, a powerful email tool will soon becomeindispensable.andP;  But the problems are not insignificant.andM;The network takes away some of the programmer's independence, with networkand server crashes strangling the development process until they are fixed.andO;But even these problems are bearable compared with the dramatic lack ofsoftware products that not just 'support' networks, but actually makeefficient use of them.andM;The problem is exacerbated because software development is a minoritybusiness activity compared with database access, spreadsheet usage and wordprocessing activities.andP;  There is evidence that software distributors anddealers are taking networks more seriously, but the problem will only besolved when the number of installed networks is large enough to make itworthwhile for programmers and developers to produce network products.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
