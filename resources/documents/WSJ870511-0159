Hermann.    The trial lawyers and their surrogate organizations have been busy publishing studies attempting to show that excessive jury awards are not to blame for the high cost of liability insurance. This is an ingenious attempt at misdirection. Certainly, there may not be that many jury awards over a million dollars. However, there are enough excessive jury awards to make playing jury lottery attractive to plaintiffs' attorneys. So what if the final award is only $500,000; that can still make the game worth playing. Also, it is the risk of a random million-dollar award that drives defendants and their insurance companies to settle at almost any cost rather than go to court.    To know the true total cost to society of all these personal injury lawsuits, one would have to add together the cost of all awards, including juries, judges and arbitration panels, the cost of out-of-court settlements that probably far exceeds the cost of all awards, defense costs and finally the cost of company management time spent defending against these lawsuits.    Jay Jones   Seattle   ---   In the &quot;Million-Dollar Verdicts and Other Rarities&quot; article I was quoted with regard to insurance-industry statistics on the proportion of claims that are settled versus those that are ultimately tried to a verdict. Unfortunately, both the use of the quoted data and the author's overall conclusions do not help us put the current liability crisis and the tort-reform debate into sharper focus.    Average jury verdicts have increased steadily over the past decade, as Mr. Hermann readily admits. But transaction costs (i.e., legal fees and other litigation expenses) now consume some 50% of the total dollars spent! And new theories of liability added to the occasional huge jury verdict make litigation an increasingly unacceptable alternative to out-of-court, early settlements. The additional threat of a bad-faith judgment directly against the insurance carrier adds further pressure to the settlement process.    Insurance-claims employees operate in an extremely complex and increasingly unpredictable environment. From years of personal experience as a former claims executive, I can attest to their highly skillful and professional performance. Jury verdicts will continue to be a diminishing, visible, &quot;tip of the iceberg&quot; as a valid indicator of the current liability crisis as long as the legal system remains so completely unpredictable and prohibitively costly.
