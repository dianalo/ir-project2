Without dissent, the panel adopted legislation that eliminatesall of the $1.8 billion for procurement of the missile but adds $70million to Bush's request of $216 million for research anddevelopment of the submarine-launched weapon.   The Senate action comes almost one month after a Trident 2missile exploded seconds after being launched from the nuclearsubmarine Tennessee about 200 miles off the coast of Florida.   Members of the Appropriations subcommittee on defense, whichrecommended cutting the program, said two successive failures inundersea test firings prompted the panel's action.   ``It was an obvious necessity,'' Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., saidearlier this week.   ``It's time to regroup,'' said Sen. Ted Stevens of Alaska,ranking Republican on the subcommittee.   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said Thursday that the Navy isnot yet yet ready to cite the exact cause of the lastest testfailure of the Trident 2 D-5 missile, but it is expected to do sosoon.   ``The Navy is confident that technical resolution (of theproblem) will not require a major redesign of the missile,''Williams said, adding that corrects may still make possibledeployment on schedule in March 1990.   A delay, Williams said, ``is not anticipated.''   In addition to reducing funds earmarked for the Trident 2, theAppropriations Committee agreed to cut research and developmentmoney for the Star Wars anti-missile shield to $3.7 million, which,when added to the $355 million in Energy Department money andmilitary construction funds, leaves a total of about $4.1 billion.   Bush had requested $4.9 billion for Star Wars, formally theStrategic Defense Initiative, in his budget for the fiscal yearbeginning Oct. 1. The Senate authorization bill put the SDI amountat $4.5 billion while the House authorization and appropriationslegislation both provide $3.1 billion.   Differences in the House and Senate appropriations bills willhave to be resolved by a conference committee.   While agreeing to the cut, the Appropriations Committee alsoadopted an amendment requiring that $820 million of the $3.7 billionbe used for research on lasers and particle beams. The vote was16-11.   ``The purpose and architecture of SDI has been a constantlychanging ball game,'' said Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La., sponsor ofthe amendment. ``With this bill, we will have spent over $20 billionon SDI, still without a purpose, still without an architecture.''   Johnston expressed concerns that the Bush administration willsacrifice long-term research on directed energy weapons such aslasers and particle beams in favor of a ``quick fix or a Phase 1deployment'' that would favor mini-missiles fired at incoming enemymissiles along the lines of the so-called ``Brillian Pebbles''scheme favored by many in the Bush administration.   The spending bill, which mirrors the authorization packageapproved by the full Senate, leaves most of Bush's programs such asthe B-2 stealth bomber and the MX and Midgetman nuclear missilesrelatively intact.   The panel also approved $255 million for the Marine Corps to testthe V-22 Osprey, a vertical-takeoff plane, and accepted thepresident's decision to kill the Navy's F-14D jet fighter.   After some discussion, Sens. Johnston and Bumpers withdrew anamendment calling for Bush to withdraw 3,000 of the 43,800 U.S.military personnel now stationed in South Korea and requiring thepresident to study and report to Congress on troop levels there.   ``We are not reneging on our committment to defend South Korea,''said Bumpers, arguing that South Korea can afford to foot more ofthe bill for defense.   The Appropriations panel also approved a $7.7 billion militaryconstruction bill that makes wholesale cuts in spending in thePhilippines and South Korea.   The bill is $1.3 billion below this year's level and about $300million less than Bush's request.</TEXT></DOC>
