The New York Stock Exchange said short interest rose 38,239,241 shares to a total of 448,190,631 shares. A month earlier, the figure was a revised 409,951,390. A year earlier, short interest was 294,019,870 shares.    The American Stock Exchange said short interest rose 2,702,458 shares to 31,704,221 shares from a revised 29,001,763. A year earlier, short interest was 25,322,514 shares.    A short sale is a sale of borrowed stock. Although a substantial short position reflects strong speculation that a stock's price will decline, some investors consider an increase in short interest bullish because the borrowed shares eventually must be repurchased.    The seller in a short sale expects the stock's price to drop, which would reduce the cost of buying shares later to return to the lender. The short interest is the number of shares that haven't been purchased for return to lenders.    Fluctuations in short interest in certain stocks also may be caused partly by arbitraging.    In a major method of securities arbitrage, a profit can be made when a company's stock is to be exchanged for that of another or for a new issue in a proposed merger, if the stocks sell at different prices.    An arbitrager might realize a profit by buying stock of one company involved in the prospective merger and selling short the stock of the other.    The largest volume increase on the Big Board was for Pan Am Corp., in which short interest rose 2.4 million shares. The next largest was in American Electric Power Co., which rose two million shares. The largest percentage increase was in Alleghany Corp.    The largest volume decrease was recorded by Aetna Life andamp; Casualty Co., whose short interest fell 6.4 million shares, or 83.4%. Aetna had headed the volume increase list the previous month. The largest percentage decrease was Americus Score Series A, which fell 99.7%.    Analysts said that despite this month's modest increase in short interest, the level of negative betting actually declined, because the ratio of short interest to average daily trading volume decreased.    &quot;We're in gear for a further market advance on an intermediate basis,&quot; said Philip Erlanger, chief technical analyst at Advest Inc. in Hartford, Conn. He said the short interest figures show that an end to the market advance that began at the start of this year &quot;is not yet at hand.&quot;    The Big Board short interest ratio in the latest period was 2.22 times average daily trading volume, compared with the previous month's 2.78.    Adjusted to remove issues that are subject to arbitrage and examining those issues that are fully &quot;at risk,&quot; the ratio for the period through mid-February dropped to 1.46 times average daily volume from 1.73 last month. The adjusted ratio is designed to reflect the degree of pessimism in the short interest figures.    Issues ranking high on this month's short interest list included a number of energy companies. Among those with large increases in short interest were some high-technology companies.    The adjacent tables show the Big Board and Amex issues in which a short interest position of at least 100,000 shares existed as of mid-February or in which there had been a short-position change of at least 50,000 shares since mid-January.
