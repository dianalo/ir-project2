And a lot of people on Wall Street hope the change sticks.    Since the early 1980s, Wall Street investment bankers and large corporate issuers have been cooperating in a high-risk, highly competitive fee-cutting game. Racing to increase market share, investment bankers turned away from the traditional method of lining up potential investors and then negotiating a price for a company's securities. Instead, they have increasingly bought the securities from the company at a set price and tried to find buyers afterward.    Issuers eagerly cooperated. Some, in fact, began selling their securities through a kind of informal instant auction. They would give a handful of investment banks an hour or two to come up with a bid; the highest offer won the securities.    The system produced high prices for issuers and record financing volume. Last year's volume of $281.9 billion was the second-highest ever, down just 11% from 1986's record $318.3 billion.    But investment bankers claim the fierce competition also cut their profits to the point that many of their biggest lines of business just weren't making money. &quot;Wall Street has exhibited a very strong death wish,&quot; said Robert G. Scott, head of the debt syndicate department at Morgan Stanley andamp; Co.    But the market crash changed that, creating such uncertainty about prices that investment bankers had to pull back. Suddenly, issuers such as General Electric Credit Corp., Associates Corp. of North America and Household Finance Corp. --all companies that generally seek aggressive bids --started doing negotiated debt offerings. &quot;In our conversations now, issuers are saying 'We want a fair deal' --which is refreshing,&quot; said one investment banker. &quot;I hope that indicates a return to stabler times.&quot;    Don't bet on it, says one issuer. &quot;I think maybe there's some wishful thinking going on,&quot; said Leo A. Halloran, senior vice president, finance, at General Electric Credit. He switched to negotiated offerings after the crash because investment banks were so timid that he thought he'd get a better rate that way than by asking for bids. But, he adds, &quot;That'll pass.&quot;    Mr. Halloran defends competitive bids, and pooh-poohs the notion that investment banks are foolishly aggressive in pursuit of business. &quot;Some bids I've gotten have been called suicidal --though not by the winning bidder,&quot; he conceded. &quot;But I think the firms had a sound business reason&quot; --for instance, to establish a position in the market.    Whether or not it changed issuers' thinking, the crash created a new humility among the investment bankers accustomed to boom times in corporate finance. Since 1979 &quot;it's been hard not to make money in the securities business, and that covered up major flaws,&quot; said Morgan Stanley's Mr. Scott. Now, however, investment banks are looking hard at their businesses and the structure of their firms.    One early result was the wave of firings that swept over Wall Street last fall. Anthony P. Grassi, head of corporate finance at First Boston Corp., said the crash offered &quot;a sort of umbrella for all of us to do what needs to be done&quot; in cutting out fat accumulated during Wall Street's rapid expansion.    In fact, the crash changed the world of corporate finance so much that many investment bankers have a hard time focusing on the pre-crash environment. &quot;I almost need shock treatment to remember,&quot; quipped one.    One factor may be that the first nine months of last year basically offered just more of the same. Old techniques grew increasingly sophisticated, but no strikingly new or different ideas emerged.    &quot;You saw the maturation of swap-linked deals,&quot; said Edson Mitchell, head of the debt financing desk at Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. The percentage of financings linked to interest rate swaps increased sharply last year, most investment bankers say. Issuers also refined their use of other hedging techniques, such as options and futures. Often, in fact, they combined the two, as in a $130 million Eastman Kodak Co. issue last June that combined warrants based on the price of gold, hedging techniques and an interest rate swap.    Last year also saw a broad expansion of the asset-backed securities market, as well as the development of more new ways to combine and recombine the cash flows from a pool of mortgages than most investors could track. &quot;So many of the new products didn't meet expectations,&quot; said Laurence D. Fink, co-head of the taxable fixed-income department at First Boston. &quot;Investors, and investment bankers, are learning after they invest in them.&quot;    But what sticks in the mind of most corporate finance officials at the end of a hair-raising final quarter isn't the complex financing structures. It's the more basic problems: the collapse of the equity market; the disaster that struck British Petroleum's $2.5 billion U.S. stock offering, priced the week before the crash but sold afterward; and the increasing difficulty in placing so-called junk bonds.    As for this year, nobody's making predictions. Instead, people are fervently hoping for a market that's stable enough to let its participants get accustomed to the new realities of their business.    That's what it will take to bring issuers back into the stock market, said Gregory E. Sacco, co-chairman of the primary capital markets department at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. &quot;These companies are run by people who went through a terrible catharsis,&quot; Mr. Sacco said. &quot;They have to get used to where their stock is. They have to look at last year as a whole and see that it was an 'OK' year.&quot;    ---         The Biggest Corporate Financings of 1987                (In millions of dollars) Debt Issuer (Date)                             Amount Raised Fannie Mae (Feb. 25)                         $1,750.2 Southland (Dec. 8)                            1,652.2 E-II Holdings (July 2)                        1,500.2 Community Program Loan 1987 A (Sept. 2)       1,031.0 CFC-2 Grantor Tr.
