Hearne, (202) 632-7184.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>On October 21, 1985, OPM published(50 FR 42531), for comment, proposed regulations on the allowance and differentialprogram. Changes have been made to the proposed regulations based on thecomments received and consideration of other pertinent factors. These changesare sufficient to warrant a new comment period.The original deadline (December 20, 1985) for comments on the originalproposed regulations was extended twice. That comment period ended on March31, 1986. We received over 300 comments from employees, three from membersof Congress, three from Federal agencies, one from a union, two from Federalexecutive associations, one from an interagency rent commission, and onefrom an economist hired by employee organizations.Many of the comments were critical of the methodology proposed in our Octobernotice. Because of these comments, OPM has designed a new methodology basedon the procedures that are typical of private sector practice in establishingcost-of-living allowances. This new methodology is presented here for comment.The comments on the previous proposal that are still relevant are discussedbelow.<ITAG tagnum="84">I. Definitions</ITAG>One commenter requested we include definitions for ``date of arrival''and ``date of departure'' that had been removed. We agree and have replacedthese two definitions in andSection; 591.201 (Definitions).An agency requested we explain when payments begin and end. We agree andthis subject is included under andSection; 591.210(g) (Payment of Allowancesand Differentials).An agency requested we specify which Federal pay plans are covered by theprogram. We agree and this subject is included under andSection; 591.203(Agencies and Employees Covered).An employee suggested we define all Hawaii allowance areas by county. Weagree and have done so in andSection; 591.204(b) (Establishment of AllowanceAreas).Several employees suggested that 50 miles by road from the three principalcities is too far for defining areas in Alaska. Fifteen miles by road wassuggested as an alternative. We believe the 50-mile radius is a reasonabledefinition of an economic community for the purposes of these regulationsand continue to use it in the definition.In addition to changes adopted to reflect comments received, we have addedthe Commonwealth of the Northern Marinas Islands to the definitions inandSection; 591.201, to the list of nonforeign areas in andSection; 591.202,and to the list of areas eligible for the post differential in andSection;591.208, because commonwealth status was conferred upon that area by Presidentialproclamation on November 3, 1986.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Statute</ITAG>Several commenters felt that the 25 percent of base pay limit for allowancepayments is artificial and inadequate. This limit is mandated by 5 U.S.C.5941.Some commenters felt the base area for comparison of living costs shouldbe somewhere other than the alleged high cost Washington, DC, area. Thebase area is also mandated in the law authorizing the program.Section 5941 of Title 5, U.S.C., specifies the District of Columbia asthe base area. There was much concern about the base area being definedto include portions of Maryland and Virginia near the city of Washington,DC. It is unrealistic to compare living costs of employees in allowanceareas to those in the District of Columbia without considering the factthat a significant number of employees working in the District live andshop in Maryland and Virginia. The President, in Executive Order 12510,amended Executive Order 10,000 to clarify the use of the Washington areaas the base area.One commenter felt our regulations should comment on the Federal tax-freestatus of allowance payments. We cannot do so because tax regulations arethe responsibility of the Department of the Treasury.There were numerous comments that the ``manner of living'' and ``differencesin good services'' language once contained in Executive Order 10,000 wereremoved without proper notice and opportunity for comment. We are boundby the Executive Order as it has been amended by the President.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Alternative Methods</ITAG>A few commenters suggested we pay Federal employees the allowances authorizedby private firms for their employees. We cannot do so because the law onlyauthorizes payments based on living costs or conditions of environment,not payments based on private sector pay practices that may rest on factorsother than those in the law.Several commenters suggested we base Federal pay on private pay withinthe allowance area. Again, the law authorizes payments based only on livingcosts or conditions of environment. Private pay rates may reflect thesefactors but also reflect size of the firm, industry mix, degree of labormarket competition, and other factors not specified in the law governingthe COLA program.One commenter suggested we use the Urban Family Budgets published by theU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics instead of conducting our own surveys,however, the Urban Family Budget series was discontinued in 1981.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Housing</ITAG>A large number of comments were received on the housing portion of theliving cost comparison, which represents a significant fraction of totalliving costs. In the previous proposal this portion was calculated in away different from the other parts of the proposed index. The earlier proposalwould have compared actual housing costs incurred by employees rather thanestimated average unit costs. Some employees suggested that the housingcost comparison must be for similar types of houses; same size, type, composition,amenities, location, etc. Under our new proposal housing costs will becalculated for similar housing units in each area.One employee suggested we use only current market prices for housing andignore earlier purchases. We disagree because the purchase price and interestrate, two important factors in home ownership costs, are very independenton the time of purchase. We want the new methodology to include the costsof consumers who purchased in past years as well as those making more recentpurchases. Because this mix reflects the average of what consumers actuallypay, it is a more accurate measure of living costs than current marketprices, which affect only those currently purchasing housing. Because theallowance is paid to all employees, not just to those recently transferredto the area, this method is more appropriate than one based only on currentpurchases.Some commenters felt the proposed housing cost survey should be replacedwith a ``rent equivalence'' approach. This method estimates the cost forowner occupied housing based on the rental rates for similar housing unitsthat are renter occupied in an area. Commenters said this sort of surveywould be easier to administer, more accurate, and permit employees in theallowance areas to achieve economic equality with employees in Washington,DC. We intend to collect data on the cost components that effect homeownersrather than estimate those costs through a survey of rental rates.Some employees believe that the housing survey starts a vicious cycle.They believe their income is so low that they can only afford to buy low-costhousing. Subsequent surveys record their low housing costs and their allowanceis reduced. They suggested we survey non-Federal employees to eliminatethis alleged problem. Under the proposed methodology we will collect housinginformation without regard to the employment of the occupant.A rental rate committee suggested that rural areas outside a 50-mile radiusof each of the three survey cities in Alaska be exempt from the provisionsof andSection; 591.207(a)(2) (Federal Quarters), which covers allowance adjustmentsfor Federal housing. We disagree. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB)Circular A-45, ``Policy Governing Charges for Rental Quarters and RelatedFacilities'', provides the rules by which rents for Federal quarters areset. This circular provides suitable adjustments for rental rates in ruralareas. To the extent that agencies follow OMB Circular A-45, no deductionsfrom allowances will occur, so no exemption is necessary.Some commenters suggested that reductions in allowance amounts for employeeswho are provided Federal housing at rates lower than those set using theOMB Circular A-45 policy should be taken from the allowance index amountinstead of from the final allowance. It is possible, for example, to haveliving costs 50-percent higher than in Washington, while the allowancerate is limited by law to only 25 percent. The intent of the suggestionwas that for employees who are provided housing below market rates, thededuction should be made from the 50-percent index rather than from the25-percent allowance rate. In effect, no deductions would be made fromthe allowance. The intent of this provision in Executive Order 10,000 isto ensure that employees in Federal housing are not given an advantageover those who live in private housing. The advantage would arise becauseemployees in Federal housing would receive the entire allowance and alsopay below market rates for their housing. The Government would be compensatingemployees twice for high living costs: once through the allowance and againthrough low cost housing. Deductions from allowances for employees in Federalhousing provided at rates below those required by OMB Circular A-45 policywill be made from the allowance actually payable to the employees.There was also some concern about the meaning of andSection; 591.207(a)(2).The intent of that section is to reduce allowance payments to employeesin Federal housing <T3>only</T3> if the agency is charging rent below that mandated by OMBCIrcular A-45. The rental rates established under the OMB policy are <T3>net rates</T3> after all appropriate adjustments have been made. Ifthe agency is in compliance with OMB Circular A-45, the employee's allowancewill be unaffected. We have revised the wording of that section to correspondmore closely with the intent of OMB Circular A-45.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Goods and Services</ITAG>There were numerous comments regarding items covered in the surveys. Mostof these comments are discussed below in section.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Special Circumstances</ITAG>Other items suggested for inclusion in the survey include legal services,appliance repair, auto power train repair, auto painting and body work,medical operations, cable TV, child care, house painting, plumbing, andfurnace repairs. There is an almost endless list of goods and servicesthat could be priced. We will publish a list of the goods and servicespriced to establish allowance rates each time we adjust the rates. In thisfashion items can be added or dropped from the survey as needed.Many commenters stated we must price the exact brand or model of an itemin each area. The commenters maintain that this step is necessary to ensurecomplete equality of purchasing power or living standard between the nonforeignareas and Washington, DC. While we do not agree that the statute guaranteeseconomic parity, we have nevertheless modified our price collection mechanismto incorporate this comment. Under the new proposal the data will be collectedusing quality specific criteria whenever possible.Several commenters suggested that sale prices for items should be includedin the survey. This issue was raised by the General Accounting Office ina 1982 study of the allowance program. We propose to not adopt this recommendationfor the following reasons:_It is doubtful that reliable data could be obtained; it would requiremore data collection; and, it would result in increased reporting burdens._Because allowance rates reflect relative living costs, sale price patternswould have to differ significantly between an allowance area and the Washingtonarea to affect an item or category index. Because the allowance is paidto the nearest 2.5 percent, a measurable impact is unlikely.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Special Circumstances</ITAG>The most frequent comments involved special circumstances or needs, ora site-specific life style generated by isolation or climate. Items mentionedincluded_additional air travel to visit relatives or for vacation or emergencies;long distance phone calls to distant relatives; lack of adequate roads;additional auto maintenance because of salt air, high humidity, or salton the roads; winter weather needs, such as snow plowing and road grading,higher auto accident rates, engine block heaters, 4-wheel drive vehicles,and snow tires; winter clothing needs, such as boots, mittens, parkas,and rain gear; leisure activity products, such as fishing, hunting, skiing,and camping gear, ice skates, snowmobiles, lift tickets, boats, and trailers;metal garbage cans; extra heating or light bills; quality of educationalopportunities; quality of medical care; and similar items. The economistrepresenting employee groups asserted an additional five index points shouldbe added to the cost-of-living allowance index to account for these differencesin needs. We do not agree. In some locations it is possible to argue thatallowances should be reduced due to warm climate (no heating bills or winterclothing), little traffic congestion or other negative factors associatedwith urban environments, and the like. In any case, the statute does notrequire living standard equality. It only permits payment of an allowancebased on relative living costs. Further, the statute forbids payments inexcess of 25 percent of base pay regardless of living cost differences.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Notice and Comment</ITAG>Some employees felt it was too difficult to find information on the allowancesin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> and suggested we continue to publish rates inFPM letters. Section 553(b) of title 5, U.S.C., specifies the <T4>Federal Register</T4> as the vehicle for notice of rulemaking. Hence,information on allowances must appear in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. Although 5 U.S.C. 553(a) exempts allowance rateadjustments from the notice and comment provisions, we think it would beuseful to publish future rate changes for comment and propose to do so.OPM will publish an FPM bulletin to be posted in Federal agencies transmittingeach <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice. The notice will provide a discussionof the survey results specifying any unusual circumstances involved inrate changes and giving more detail on the methods employed. In addition,newspapers in the allowance areas generally report on our rate changes.We believe this will provide sufficient notice of OPM actions.Several commenters suggested we hold public hearings on these regulations.We received over 300 written comments on various aspects of the originalproposed regulations. We therefore believe the comment period gave ampleopportunity for interested parties to make known their views and that publichearings would not add new information. We anticipate that this new commentperiod on the revised regulations will also generate a significant responsefrom interested parties.<ITAG tagnum="84">VIII. Miscellaneous</ITAG>Many employees commented on the hardships that result when allowances arereduced. The consensus seemed to be that any allowance reduction shouldbe made gradually. Executive Order 10,000 permits gradual reduction inallowance rates only when the reduction is due to a change in methodology.The Executive Order further states that OPM must review the rates at leastannually to ``insure that payment of additional compensation shall continueonly during the continuance of conditions justifying such payment and shallnot in any instance exceed the amount justified.'' This language precludesthe gradual reduction of allowance rates if the change is not caused bya change in methodology.Many employees feel that the allowance should compensate for environmentalhardship. We do not agree. The Executive Order permits two payments basedon separate circumstances: an allowance to be based on living costs; anda differential to be based on environmental hardship. Because employeescan receive both an allowance and a differential, it would be inappropriateto include environmental factors in the allowance.One commenter felt that a post differential hardship allowance should bepaid in outlying areas of Alaska. At present, we are paying a 25 percentallowance. The law limits payments of allowances or differentials, or acombination of both to 25 percent. Thus, it is not possible to authorizean additional payment in these outlying areas.Another comment suggested we consider recruitment and retention conditionsin setting allowance rates. Although the reason for the allowance was toenable the Government to recruit and retain a competent workforce, ExecutiveOrder 10,000 bases the allowance only on living costs and does not includeadditional payment for recruitment and retention incentives. These conditions,therefore, cannot be factors in setting allowance rates. Recruitment andretention problems for specific occupations, grades and locations are handledthrough the special rates program authorized by 5 U.S.C. 5303.Many commenters in Puerto Rico believe consideration should be given tothe taxation of the allowance by the Commonwealth government. This issueis currently under litigation in the United States District Court for theDistrict of Puerto Rico in <T3>Parker </T3>v. <T3>Alicea and Horner </T3>(No. 87-0386, March 13, 1987). Hawaii also taxesthe allowance. The Federal government taxes the differential but not theallowance. Because current Federal tax regulations exempt allowance paymentsfrom Federal income tax, it would be to the general disadvantage of theemployees if we considered income taxes when calculating the allowance.Calculations involving income tax must consider Federal taxes as well asstate, commonwealth, and local taxes. Because an allowance eligible employee'sFederal tax burden is either zero or equal to what would be paid in Washington,including Federal taxes would generally lower the indexes more than includingstate, commonwealth, and local taxes would raise them.One commenter stated that commissaries in Alaska are the only ones thatmust pay for transportation of goods to the site. Any transportation feesincluded in the prices charged to the consumers in the commissary are includedin the prices we collect there. Surcharges added at the cash register arealso included in the index calculations.These regulations provide substantial detail with respect to the substance,subjects, and issues involved in the program and determining and settingallowance rates. The new proposed regulations reflect a balancing of objectivity,precision, and feasibility that takes into account OPM's experience inadministering the program, a careful analysis of the comments receivedon the original proposed regulations, input from private sector expertsin the field, and the current state of the applicable law as relected instatute, Executive order, and court decisions.Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana IslandsAn interim rule adding the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islandsto the locations covered by the post differential and setting a 25-percentdifferential rate there was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on April 15, 1987 (52 FR 12131). We receivedno comments on that rule and it will be incorporated in these regulationswhen they are finalized. Current Allowance and Differential RatesAllowance rates currently in effect were previously published in FPM Bulletins591-30 (Anchorage) and 591-32 and 591-33 (all other locations). Post differentialrates currently in effect were published in 5 CFR Part 591, Appendix Bof Subpart B, except for the rate for the Commonwealth of the NorthernMariana Islands, which appeared in FPM Bulletin 591-34. The rates currentlyauthorized will not change until the new regulations go into effect. Theseregulations will eliminate some of the allowance categories that existedunder the previous regulations. The Local Retail/Federal Housing and Commissary/Exchange/FederalHousing allowance categories will cease to exist when these regulationsare finalized. Deductions in allowances paid to employees in Federal housingwill be handled under andSection;591.207(a)(2) (Federal Quarters), insteadof as a separate allowance category.Any necessary deductions for employees in the old Local Retail/FederalHousing Category will be from the new Local Retail Category allowance.Those from the old Commissary/Exchange/Federal Housing Catgory will befrom the new Commissary/Exchange Category.The following allowance rates (reprinted from the FPM material cited above)and categories are authorized until these new regulations go into effect.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/> <H1>Location/category </H1><H1>Allowance rates (percent)</H1> State of AlaskaAnchorage and 50 miles by road: <ITAG tagnum="2">Local retail/private housing <D>25.0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Local retail/Federal housing <D>17.5 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Commissary/exchange/private housing <D>17.5 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Commissary/exchange/Federal housing <D>7.5 </D></ITAG>Fairbanks and 50 miles by road: <ITAG tagnum="2">Local retail/private housing <D>25.0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Local retail/Federal housing <D>25.0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Commissary/exchange/private housing <D>20.0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Commissary/exchange/federal housing <D>15.0 </D></ITAG>Juneau and 50 miles by road: <ITAG tagnum="2">Local retail/private housing <D>25.0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Local retail/Federal housing <D>25.0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Commissary/exchange/private housing <D>25.0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Commissary/exchange/federal housing <D>25.0 </D></ITAG>Alaska-all other locations: <ITAG tagnum="2">Local retail/private housing <D>25.0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Local retail/Federal housing <D>25.0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Commissary/exchange/private housing <D>25.0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Commissary/exchange/Federal housing <D>25.0 </D></ITAG>State of Hawaii City and county of Honolulu (Oahu): <ITAG tagnum="2">Local retail/private housing <D>22.5 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Local retail/Federal housing <D>5.0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Commissary/exchange/private housing <D>12.5 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Commissary/exchange/Federal housing <D>0 </D></ITAG>County of Maui (Islands of Maui, Molokai, Lanai): <ITAG tagnum="2">Local retail/private housing <D>20.0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Local retail/Federal housing <D>12.5 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Commissary/exchange/private housing <D>N/A </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Commissary/exchange/Federal housing <D>N/A </D></ITAG>County of Kauai: <ITAG tagnum="2">Local retail/private housing <D>17.5 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Local retail/Federal housing <D>7.5 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Commissary/exchange/private housing <D>17.5 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Commissary/exchange/Federal housing <D>7.5 </D></ITAG>County of Hawaii: <ITAG tagnum="2">Local retail/private housing <D>15.0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Local retail/Federal housing <D>7.5 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Commissary/exchange/private housing <D>N/A </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Commissary/exchange/Federal housing <D>N/A </D></ITAG>Territory of Guam Guam: <ITAG tagnum="2">Local retail/private housing <D>12.5 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Local retail/Federal housing <D>12.5 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Commissary/exchange/private housing <D>0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Commissary/exchange/Federal housing <D>0 </D></ITAG>Commonwealth of Puerto Rico Puerto Rico: <ITAG tagnum="2">Local retail/private housing <D>10.0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Local retail/Federal housing <D>7.5 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Commissary/exchange/private housing <D>0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Commissary/exchange/Federal housing <D>0 </D></ITAG>Virgin Islands St. Croix: <ITAG tagnum="2">Local retail/private housing <D>12.5 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Local retail/Federal housing <D>0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Commissary/exchange/private housing <D>N/A </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Commissary/exchange/Federal housing <D>N/A </D></ITAG>St. Thomas andamp;

In establishing the limits of allowanceareas, OPM considers (1) the existence of a well defined economic community;(2) the availability of consumer goods and services; (3) the concentrationof Federal employees covered by this subpart; and (4) unique circumstancesrelated to a specific location.(b) The following allowance areas have been established where an allowanceis authorized to be paid:(1) <T3>State of Hawaii. </T3>(i) City and County of Honolulu.(ii) County of Kauai.(iii) County of Maui (including Kalawao County).(iv) County of Hawaii.(2) <T3>State of Alaska. </T3>(i) City of Anchorage and 50 mile radius by road.(ii) City of Fairbanks and 50 mile radius by road.(iii) City of Juneau and 50 mile radius by road.(iv) The rest of the State.(3) <T3>Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. </T3>The entire Commonwealth.(4) <T3>The Virgin Islands.</T3> (i) St. Croix.(ii) St. Thomas and St. John.(5) <T3>Territory of Guam. </T3>The entire Territory.(c) The head of a department or agency will submit requests in writingto OPM for the establishment or revision of allowance areas.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 591.205</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Comparative cost index.</ITAG>(a) OPM calculates allowance rates for each area by comparing costs offour categories of expenses in the area to those in the Washington, D.C.area. Two allowance rates are calcualted for each area; Local Retail andCommissary/Exchange (see andSection; 591.207 of this part). The four categorieof expenses are:(1) Consumption goods and services.(2) Transportation.(3) Housing.(4) Miscellaneous expenses.(b) Costs are determined for several income levels and home occupancy types(renter or owner), and averaged.(l) Consumption goods and services budgets (excluding transportation andhousing) are estimated from appropriate consumer expenditure data at variousincome levels for a standard family size. The base budget amounts for goodsand services are adjusted by price index multipliers to estimate the budgetamounts required in each area.(i) Goods and serfvices surveyed. The goods and services surveyed for theconsumption portion of the system are derived from consumer expendituresurveys. Whenever possible, exact brands and models are priced in eachlocation. Price data are obtained from appropriate retail outlets in eacharea. Price data from military facilities are provided by the Departmentof Defense where needed. Individual items are grouped into categories accoundingto common functions or uses.(ii) The item and category weights are derived from consumer expendituresurveys. The category weights vary by income.(2) Transportation costs for each income level and area are estimated usingdata collected by or for OPM on automobile operating expenses and otherfactors affecting transportation costs.(3) Housing costs for renters and owners are estimated based on similarhousing units. Standard shelter specifications (type, size, age) are selectedfor each income level. Appropriate living communities to survey based onthe income level and housing type specified are selected for each surveylocation. Housing data on units within the selected communities meetingthe specifications are then collected. Mortgage interest rate and paymentdata are collected from lending institutions in the area, utility companiesand other sources provide information about utility rates, and local governmentsprovide information on real estate tax rates. These data are then combinedto estimate dollar expenditures within each survey area for the specifiedshelter in the selected community.(4) Miscellaneous expenses. Miscelleous expenses for gifts, contributions,savings and investments, retirement, and life insurance are estimated fromconsumer expenditure surveys and other data appropriate for Federal employeesfor each income level.(c) The dollar amounts estimated for consumption,transportation, housing,and miscellaneous expenses are combined into a total amount for each ofthe multiple income levels and renter/owner status. The renter budgetsand owner budgets for each income level are combined using weights representingthe proportion of renters and owners at each income level derived fromappropriate cunsumer expenditure or census data. The budgets for each locationare weighted into one average amount based on the GS grade distributionfor the areas. The area budget is divided by the Washington, DC, area budgetto generate a comparative cost index. The allowance rate for the area isbased upon the index.(d) OPM will describe in detail the calculation of each allowance rateat the time the rate is published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>for comment.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 591.206</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Establishment of allowance rates.</ITAG>(a) OPM uses the comparative cost indexes for each allowance area to determinethe allowance rates for that area. The range of values within which theindex value falls determines the appropriate allowance rate, expressedas a percentage of the rate of basic pay for that category of eligibleemployee.(b) The following table shows the comparative index range and correspondingallowance rate to be established for an allowance category under andSection;591.207 of this part:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Comparative Index and Allowance Rate Table</T4><H1>Index range</H1><H1>Allowance rate (percent)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Less than 105.0 <D>0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">105.0 to 106.2 <D>5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">106.3 to 108.7 <D>7.5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">108.8 to 111.2 <D>10</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">111.3 to 113.7 <D>12.5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">113.8 to 116.2 <D>15</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">116.3 to 118.7 <D>17.5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">118.8 to 121.2 <D>20</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">121.3 to 123.7 <D>22.5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">123.8 and over <D>25</D></ITAG></ITAG>(c) Allowance area survey summaries, category indexes, and allowance ratesare published as notices in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;591.207 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Allowance categories, eligibility, and adjustments.</ITAG>(a) Section 205(b) of Executive Order 10,000, as amended, requires adjustmentsto allowance payments where warranted because of Federal quarters or specialpurchasing privileges. These adjustments occur only when the quarters orpurchasing privileges are made available as a result of Federal civilianemployment and result in substantially lower costs when compared to localarea costs.(1) Special purchasing privileges. Adjustments for access to commissariesand exchanges are incorporated into the comparative index calculationsand the resulting allowance rates.(2) Federal quarters. If the rent charged an employee by an agency forquarters is less than the net reasonable value rent, after appropriateadjustments, established as prescribed by the Office of Management andBudget, the difference between the rent charged and the reasonable valuerent will be deducted from the allowance paid by the employing agency upto, but not exceeding, the amount of the allowance.(b) The allowance categories that are established in each area are_(1) ``Local Retail,'' which applies to those Federal employees who purchasegoods and services from private retail establishments.(2) ``Commissary/Exchange,'' which applies to those Federal employees whoshop at private retail establishments, but who, as a result of their Federalcivilian employment, also have unlimited access to commissary and exchangefacilities. This category is established only in those allowance areasthat have these facilities.(c) Eligibility for access to commissary and exchange facilities is determinedby the appropriate military department.
