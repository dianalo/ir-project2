He usually made money, received a sweetheart deal or two andoccasionally was bailed out of financial jams by friends andassociates. But the transactions never made Wright rich.   And at least one major non-energy investment turned into asubstantial loss for the future House speaker, whose financialclimb began only after years spent in debt.   Now battling House ethics committee charges that he may havecommitted 69 rules violations in his private business transactions,Wright was a self-described pauper in 1971.   ``My finances are a shambles,'' he wrote in his diary Dec. 30that year. ``With what unbelievable folly have I so long ignoredthem and let them drift ... I'm driving a 10-year-old car, owe sogod-awful much money I'll need luck to pay it off. But I will,somehow I will.''   Wright's luck changed one day early in 1979, when he showed upearly for a scheduled lunch with a family of Fort Worth oilinvestors, the Moncriefs.   By chance, family members told the ethics committee, the oilmenbegan discussing whether to invest in an east Texas gas well.Family patriarch and oil lobbyist Monty Moncrief, and his son Tex,had little interest in the relatively small investment. But Tex'sson Richard suggested that his grandfather make the deal for someof the other grandchildren.   Richard and Monty Moncrief turned to Wright and asked if hewanted ``to take a little interest in this deal.'' The then-Housemajority leader accepted, later investing $19,788.   Before that day Wright had assets of between $72,000 and$170,000 _ mostly the value of his Fort Worth home _ according tohis 1978 financial disclosure form. The report requires listings ofincome and assets only in broad ranges.   From then forward, his finances improved. But it was a rollercoaster ride _ up one year, down the next _ according to a recordpieced together from his own congressionally required disclosurestatements, the report of the ethics committee's special counsel,Richard J. Phelan, and published material.   Wright profited from interests in oil and gas wells, a handsomereturn on two oil stocks sold by his half-owned investment company,Mallightco, and Mallightco gemstone and real estate investments.   But he lost most of $100,000 he had borrowed to invest in anursing home company that later filed for bankruptcy protection,even though he got back at least $22,000 in dividends that othershareholders were unsuccessful in obtaining, according to publishedreports.   Wright's most profitable deal was in 1988, just before he soldhis half of Mallightco to his partner, George Mallick. By that timeWright's share was part of a blind trust he created in 1987. Hedirected the trustee to sell his share to recoup enough money topay off the nursing home loan.   Mallick, meanwhile, was looking for a last, ``bet the farm''investment. It turned up with the purchase and same-day resale ofan interest in an prospective oil and gas well. Mallightco boughtthe well for $9,120 in cash and sold it for a $340,000 profit. Thewell turned up dry.   The ethics committee is still investigating that pair oftransactions, even as it plans for hearings on the 69 unrelatedallegations that Wright circumvented House income limits andaccepted improper gifts from Mallick.   According to his disclosure statements, Wright's income wasbetween $85,703 and $101,700 in 1979. It climbed to between$192,560 and $326,550 in 1983, the year he sold his Fort Worthhome, and peaked at $358,764 to $736,758 in 1986, when he earnedsignificant oil and gas revenue and profited from a cabletelevision stock sale. In 1987, it fell to between $169,185 and$177,682.   Wright listed the value of his holdings in 1983, the peak year,at between $415,015 and $1,075,000. Half the total was attributedto investments in oil and gas wells and the value of his Fort Worthhome.   By 1987, when the holdings went into the blind trust, his listedassets dropped to a range of between $155,000 and $435,000. Part ofthe difference can be attributed to the way speaker filled out hisdisclosure forms.   Wright sold his Fort Worth home, valued at between $100,001 and$250,000 in August 1983, and purchased a more expensive home inMcLean, Va., which last year was appraised at more than $352,000,according to the Wall Street Journal.   The Texas Democrat's Fort Worth home was listed as an asset inaccordance with the rules because it produced rental income. TheMcLean home apparently had no rental income and was not listed aspart of Wright's holdings.   Another possible contributor for the drop in assets was Wright'sdisastrous 1983 investment in Jewell Enterprises of Arlington,Texas, a nursing home venture.   Whether or not Wright received favored treatment throughdividend payments, as other Jewell stockholders told The New YorkTimes last week, his investment became worthless when the companyfiled for bankruptcy protection in 1985 and later began liquidation.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
