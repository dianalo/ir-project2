Lawton Chiles of Florida, who swept into office lastfall with an average campaign contribution of only $69.95, isblunt about his goal: Kick big money out of Florida politics.   Only three months after taking office, the Democraticgovernor already has pushed a major overhaul of the state'scampaign-finance system through the state House and isgirding for a grueling battle in the Senate.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;This is part of people believing that they are part ofthe system again,&quot; says the former U.S. senator, who abruptlyended his retirement from politics last year with a populistcampaign that transformed him into something of a zealot.&quot;Bonds have been let, projects have been set, contracts havebeen granted, appointments have been made -- all on the basisof contributions. The public knows this, so the public doesnot trust,&quot; he says.   Mr. Chiles, who now does his crusading inside thegovernor's mansion, on a tranquil promenade just offTallahassee's business corridor, luxuriates in his new roleas political rebel. But he is not a lone warrior. While thedrive to overhaul the nation's campaign-finance systemrepeatedly has been stymied at the federal level, it isroiling the political waters in a number of states. Amongthem are New York, California, Iowa, Arizona, South Carolinaand Texas.   &quot;This fundamental problem at the national level exists atthe state level, too, and it's becoming more and moreapparent to people,&quot; says Fred Wertheimer, president ofCommon Cause, the self-styled citizens' lobby withheadquarters in Washington and branches across the country.&quot;It's all part of reaching the point where the Americanpublic is saying, `Enough is enough.'&quot;   The effort to overhaul campaign financing at the statelevel is being fueled in part by a new wave of scandals instatehouses across the country. In the past year alone, thespeakers of the New York Assembly and Texas House have beenindicted, undercover operations have led to charges againstseveral lawmakers in Arizona and South Carolina, andconspiracy charges have been made against legislators inTennessee.   The groundswell has even reached states such as Kansasthat haven't had major scandals. A commission on ethicalconduct filed recommendations in Topeka this winter callingfor banning campaign contributions by corporations, unionsand political action committees. Lawmakers are even talkingabout public financing of statewide races.   &quot;There's a widespread feeling there needs to be somereform,&quot; says William Hoch, a political consultant who hasworked with candidates of both parties in Kansas. &quot;There isless appetite these days for the manipulation of the publictrust.&quot;   The New York Assembly passed a bill last session thatwould provide matching funds for candidates who agree tospending limits that range from $7 million for gubernatorialgeneral-election campaigns to $75,000 for the Assembly. Thebill also would impose contribution restrictions that, in thecase of gubernatorial races, would drop the biggest gifts to$4,000 from nearly $43,000 now. A new effort to win finalpassage is expected this year. Democratic Gov. Mario Cuomo, alongtime advocate of changing the campaign-finance system, isworking on his own package.   &quot;The problem is that it's hard to know whether politiciansare just talking about this like a `motherhood' issue orwhether they are really going to cut off the flow ofspecial-interest money that they rely upon more and more toget elected,&quot; says Julian Palmer, executive director for NewYork State Common Cause. The group is part of a statewidecoalition -- including the League of Women Voters and headedby former Secretary of State Cyrus Vance and Fordham LawSchool Dean John Ferrick -- that is trying to build publicsupport for a campaign-finance overhaul.   In Florida, Gov. Chiles is wagering that he can stanch theflow of money and address the perception that, as Universityof Florida political scientist Richard Scher puts it,&quot;there's too much money talking much too loudly incampaigns.&quot;   The Chiles plan would limit campaign contributions forstatewide and legislative races to $500, ban corporateentities from making more than one $500 contribution in acontested race, set aside $4 million a year for publicfinancing of statewide races and provide as much as $2.5million in taxpayer money for each gubernatorial candidate ifboth agree to cap their individual spending at $5 million.   At the heart of the plan is a provision that would kick induring gubernatorial campaigns in which one candidate agreedto the public-financing and spending-limit system and theother didn't. In those cases, the state would provide theparticipating candidate with funds equal to the amount bywhich his opponent exceeded the limit.   &quot;This system is designed so that no one opts out,&quot; saysJames Krog, Mr. Chiles's chief of staff. &quot;If your opponentgoes over the limit, you can reach into a pot and get extramoney. This is a nuclear deterrant. It's mutually assureddestruction applied to political finance.&quot;   But Mr. Chiles faces opposition in the Florida Senate. Thepresident of that body, Democrat Gwen Margolis, says theproposal has &quot;a long way to go&quot; to win approval. Manylawmakers, facing state Senate races that can cost as much as$500,000, are concerned about the $500 contribution limit.Others find the whole notion of public financing distasteful.   &quot;We're almost $2 billion short in revenues, and I don'tknow anyone who wants to spend $20 million to fundcampaigns,&quot; says Ander Crenshaw, the Senate Republicanleader. &quot;We don't have enough money to fund programs forretarded children. Any money we divert to campaigns is aterrible idea.&quot;   At the same time, some critics are asking whether theChiles plan would skew the political system, perhaps bydiverting money to the state's weak political parties or bynudging candidates to appeal to wellorganized interest groupsthat can provide organizational help to their campaigns.   &quot;Does this mean the end to all troubles?&quot; Gov. Chiles saysof his proposal. &quot;No, it does not. But it really shakes thegame up.&quot;   J.M. &quot;Mac&quot; Stipanovich, a Tallahassee political consultantwho ran former GOP Gov. Bob Martinez's unsuccessfulre-election campaign last fall, argues that thecampaign-spending limits would make it more difficult tomount challenges to incumbents.   &quot;The governor of Florida can generate news coverage andfree publicity with `news,' while the challenger can stand onthe statehouse steps and light his hair on fire and stillonly get on the bottom of page B3 without a picture,&quot; Mr.Stipanovich says. &quot;The challenger needs to be able to spendmoney for ads.&quot;   Even so, political circles in Tallahassee and other statecapitals are trying to get used to the idea that changes maybe coming.   &quot;The bottom line is that this is going to pass, and we'regoing to have to live with it,&quot; says William Rubin, aTallahassee lobbyist and Democratic political consultant. &quot;Itwill change life as we know it.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
