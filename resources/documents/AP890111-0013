U.S. District Judge Robert Ward granted the order againstOperation Rescue, which is based in upstate Binghamton, at therequest of lawyers for various women's groups and clinics, which hadsued last April.   Ward ordered that if the injunction is violated, a $25,000 finewill be imposed against the organization on the first day anddoubled for each additional day it is violated.   The injunction does not preclude members of Operation Rescue fromprotesting on sidewalks outside abortion facilities.   The order does bar them from trespassing on the grounds ofclinics in New York and suburban Nassau, Suffolk and Westchestercounties or obstructing people from entering the buildings. It alsoprohibits members from physically abusing or harassing anyone whoseeks services or works at the clinics.   Michael Tierney, an attorney for Operation Rescue, said he hadnot seen the order and could not comment.   David Cole, a lawyer at the Center for Constitutional Rights,which represented the plaintiffs, said the judge had previouslyissued two temporary restraining orders against members of OperationRescue.   The first was in response to a week-long demonstration by thegroup last May and a second for demonstrations planned in October,according to Cole.   Ward imposed a $50,000 fine against Operation Rescue fordemonstrations actually carried out at two clinics in May. The finehas not yet been paid, he said.   Cole said his clients asked for a permanent injunction when theylearned that Operation Rescue had planned another series of protestsfor Jan. 12-14 in the metropolitan area.   The plaintiffs include the National Organization for Women andseveral clinics in the area, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
