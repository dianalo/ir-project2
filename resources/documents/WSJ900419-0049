Lincoln agreed in February 1989 to put up $13 million intwo business deals with Saudi European Bank, a frequentbusiness partner of Mr. Keating's. At the same time, thegovernment lawyers asserted in federal court here, the Saudibank agreed to loan $3.75 million to American ContinentalCorp., Lincoln's parent. American Continental needed themoney because it was facing bond payments of about $5 millionin early April, the lawyers said. Mr. Keating is AmericanContinental's chairman.</LP><TEXT>   Lincoln was taken over on April 14 of last year, and thegovernment has said it may cost more than $2 billion to bailout the Irvine, Calif., thrift. Regulators said the thriftwas engaging in many such transactions that benefitedAmerican Continental at the expense of Lincoln, which heldmore than $4 billion in government-insured deposits.   James Murphy, a lawyer for the government, described thetransactions with the Saudi bank as he cross-examined Mr.Keating for a second day in Mr. Keating's suit to reverse thetakeover.   Mr. Keating angrily denied that the three transactionswith the Saudi bank were related. &quot;Mr. Murphy, that is notcorrect,&quot; he said. &quot;That is absurd.&quot;   But Stanley Sporkin, the federal district judge presidingover the trial, asked Mr. Keating whether having AmericanContinental and Lincoln do business with the same customersdidn't raise conflict-of-interest problems. &quot;Sometimes youwore a Lincoln hat. Sometimes you wore an (AmericanContinental) hat,&quot; Judge Sporkin said. &quot;So didn't you openyourself to these kinds of suggestions?&quot;   &quot;Yes,&quot; Mr. Keating replied. But he maintained that hedidn't even know of Lincoln's transactions with the Saudibank.   Mr. Murphy described an intricate series of transactionsin which he said Lincoln sold part of a profit participationin a business run by British financier Sir James Goldsmith,only to buy it back six months later. The transaction allowedAmerican Continental to book a $37 million gain for 1987.Without the gain, American Continental would have had a lossof $11 million for that year, the government said.   Mr. Murphy introduced a Lincoln memo suggesting that thebuyer of the profit participation -- a subsidiary of SaudiEuropean Bank -- wanted only a &quot;fee&quot; and interest when theparticipation was sold back to Lincoln. Mr. Murphy said thatthis indicated the participation had been sold to the Saudibank subsidiary simply as a ruse to enable AmericanContinental to record the gain.   In addition, Mr. Murphy said, the participation had beensold for $59 million, when Mr. Keating had estimated itsvalue at about $75 million. Lincoln bought the participationback from the subsidiary for $68.5 million.   Mr. Keating said Mr. Goldsmith's business plans for theunit, General Oriental Securities Limited Partnership,changed and the Saudi bank subsidiary decided it no longerwanted the profit participation. &quot;They had no expectation Iwould take them out of that transaction&quot; when Lincolnoriginally sold the participation, Mr. Keating said.</TEXT></DOC>
