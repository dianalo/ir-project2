Michael Dukakis that theUnited States reserves the right to ``use nuclear force'' in Europeis a restatement of a longstanding but sometimes confusing policyof the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.   In the arcane parlance of nuclear weapons, there is a distinctdifference between the phrases ``first strike'' and ``first use.''   As used by nuclear strategists, the term ``first strike'' refersto a pre-emptive nuclear attack by one superpower against theother. U.S. officials have repeatedly said no such strike will beundertaken by the United States.   The phrase ``first use'' generally refers to the use of atomicweapons in Europe, an option the United States has long kept open.   U.S. policy is that the United States and its NATO allies mighthave to resort to nuclear weapons to stop a Soviet attack withconventional weapons. Supporters of NATO have argued that thepossibility of a U.S. nuclear strike is the main threat feared bythe Soviets.   The American threat arises from the Soviets' large numericaladvantage in a variety of conventional weapons such as tanks andartillery.   Dukakis was attacked on Tuesday by Democratic presidential rivalAlbert Gore for his reference to the possible use of nuclearweapons in Europe. Gore said the United States should not tip itshand on the use of nuclear force.   Dukakis responded that he was merely restating longstandingpolicy, and the record largely bears that out.   Retired Army Gen. Bernard Rogers, the former commander of NATO,repeatedly told Congress that because of the Soviets' advantage inconventional weapons, NATO might have to resort to the first use ofnuclear weapons within ``a matter of days'' to halt a large-scaleSoviet attack.   The policy has received new attention in the debate over theIntermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty, the U.S.-Soviet packeliminating medium-range atomic weapons.   Critics of the INF pact, such as conservative Republicans, haveargued that eliminating the nuclear threat posed by the U.S.Pershing II and ground-launched cruise missiles was one of the mainreasons the Soviets agreed to the pact.   Even supporters of the treaty have argued that NATO needs toupgrade its conventional forces to keep the peace in Europe.   While American doctrine for strategic, or long-range, atomicweapons is based on a ``no first strike'' plan, U.S. officials havebeen intentionally vague about spelling out just what would causethe launching of the United States strategic arsenal.   For example, American strategic doctrine is generally thought tobe based on the philosophy that the United States would be able toride out a Soviet first strike and then deal a devastatingcounterattack. That doctrine of absorbing the first strike arisesfrom the desire to avoid a nuclear war caused by computer error, nomatter how small that likelihood.</TEXT></DOC>
