The obtained data enabled toconclude that metastable matallic alloys represented systems with strongelectron-electron interaction in virtual phonon exchanges. Because ofthis the electron energy spectrum of these alloys differs from the spectraof pure metals by weakly occupied conductivity band and a great numberof groups of covalently bound electrons in the vicinity of Fermi level.</TEXT></DOC>
