Fakhoury said Lebanon wants the council to condemn the raid,demand that Israel withdraw and take steps to prevent furtherIsraeli ``aggression.''   Israeli Ambassador Johanan Bein told the council his countrythrust into Lebanon to protect itself. He said years of civil warhave left Lebanon unable to curb the warring Arab factions that useits territory to attack Israel.   ``Israel's only interest and purpose in this operation was todefend and ensure the peace and security of its villages andtowns,'' Bein said.   The real threats to Lebanon, he said, are the 35,000 Syriantroops in that country, Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas whowant to set up a radical Islamic state and feuding factions of thePalestine Liberation Organization.   Two Palestinian factions battled in Beirut slums on Friday,leaving at least 28 people dead and 90 wounded, said police in theLebanese capital.   According to Fakhoury, about 800 Israeli troops were still insouthern Lebanon on Thursday. Bein said Israel had withdrawn all ofits troops Wednesday, two days after the raid was launched.   Israeli officials said their operation was aimed at Palestinianguerrillas, but it turned into a battle with Hezbollah guerrillasin Maydoun, a village in southern Lebanon.   Fakhoury said 3,000 Israeli troops and their Lebanese Christianmilitia allies destroyed homes, orchards and crops and left atleast 500 families homeless, including the population of Maydoun.   Bein said Hezbollah had evicted all the civilians from Maydoun ayear ago and turned it into a fortified guerrilla base. ``Duringthe action, utmost caution was taken to avoid civiliancasualties,'' he said.   Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982 and withdrew most of itsoccupation forces in 1985, but maintains a six-to-10 mileself-declared security zone in southern Lebanon as a buffer againstterrorist raids.   The council is scheduled to resume debate Monday.</TEXT></DOC>
