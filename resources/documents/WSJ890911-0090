Buyers for the properties include a number of well-known U.S. real-estate concerns.    The Coal Board, which invests about $20 billion of United Kingdom coal workers' pension money, bought the properties over the past decade, when the real-estate market was much stronger than it is today. It put its American real-estate portfolio on the block, it said, because it thought there were better opportunities for real-estate investment in Europe.    The Watergate complex will be purchased either by Dallas developer Trammel Crow Co. or Washington builder Oliver Carr Co., according to people close to the negotiations. They said Morgan Stanley Realty, the real-estate arm of Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. that is handling the sale, was negotiating with both parties and is expected to select the winning bidder within a week. Morgan Stanley Realty declined comment on the sale.    The sales price for the Watergate, most famous as the scene of the break-in at Democratic headquarters that led to the resignation of President Richard M. Nixon, will be between $100 million and $120 million, said people close to the deal.    The Coal Board has also signed a contract with the New York-based J.W. O'Connor Co. to purchase 12 retail properties, consisting of two regional shopping centers and 10 smaller developments, located mainly in Southern California.    The Coal Board plans to sell its 38 office and warehouse properties to Trammel Crow Ventures, a subsidiary of Trammel Crow. The Coal Board's properties are held by its subsidiaries, Pan-American Properties, Inc. and Buckingham Holdings Inc. People involved with the sale wouldn't provide details on exactly how much the Coal Board will receive for each piece of the portfolio.    While the Coal Board's retail properties attracted the most investor interest, the sale of the Watergate is expected to arouse the most public curiosity. Opened in 1965, the Watergate includes a 237-room hotel, two office buildings and shopping areas. Its location and riverfront views make it a prime property.    British Coal's sale of its U.S. holdings runs counter to the national trend of foreigners increasing their share of U.S. real estate. Over the last half decade, Japanese, British, Canadian and other overseas interests have taken big bites of the U.S. real-estate market, particularly in major markets such as New York, Los Angeles and Washington. Over the next few years, investor attention is expected to shift toward Europe, where internal trade barriers will be eliminated in 1992. </TEXT></DOC>
