Overall 10-year relapse-freesurvival rate is 94% (97,3% stage I, 85,5% stage II A-B). Global survival-rate:95,8% (100% stage I). Saving treatment was always effective in five relapsesat stage I (2 lymphnodal recurrences in untreated areas, and 3 distantmetastases). Out of twelve relapses at stage II A-B and Nx patients (4lymphnodal recurrences in treated areas, 2 in untreated areas, and 6distant metastases) saving treatment was effective in 3 patients, oneof whom died for radiation late effect. Nine radiation sequelae wereobserved, three of which were neoplastic diseases. Referring to analysisof the results, failure and possible options in the management of semiomas,the authors confirm the effectiveness of current treatment schedule.33 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
