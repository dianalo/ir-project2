Upset over General Electric Co.'s involvement in themanufacture of nuclear materials for weapons, HuguleyMemorial Hospital in Fort Worth, Texas, purchased $2.7million of diagnostic equipment from a GE competitor. For thesame reason, Central Kansas Medical Center in Great Bend,Kan., shunned GE medical equipment and made orders of about$1.8 million with another manufacturer.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;GE's nuclear involvement played a 100% role in ourdecision,&quot; says Roger Baker, the head of the radiologydepartment at Huguley Memorial Hospital. Based on hisrecommendations, he says, the hospital administrators lastyear purchased a CT scanner from Philips N.V., a Dutchcompany, and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machine fromDiasonics Inc., whose MRI business now is owned by ToshibaCorp. &quot;Under no circumstances would I have accepted GEmachines. If it would have come to that, I would have put myjob on the line,&quot; he says.   Such boycotts are part of a campaign started by a Bostonactivist group, Infact, in June 1986. The group has publisheda list of nine hospitals around the country that it says areshunning GE medical equipment, at an estimated loss of $7.2million since the boycott began. (Infact says the boycott hasspread to GE's appliances and light bulbs as well. Itestimates the total impact at $60 million.)   However, other manufacturers to which hospitals areturning, including Philips and Siemens AG, are also defensecontractors. &quot;It is a difficult situation,&quot; concedes aspokesman for Physicians for Social Responsibility, a groupof doctors and health-care professionals based in Washingtonthat endorsed the GE boycott last September. &quot;But it'simportant to single out one company to send a message to allothers. We also realized that because GE has substantialbusiness in medical equipment in the U.S., the boycott wouldbe effective.&quot;   GE declines to discuss details of the boycott, saying theimpact has been negligible. Nevertheless, the Fairfield,Conn., company, with annual revenue of $55 billion, isconcerned enough that its marketing managers accompanysalesmen in negotiations with hospitals that raise thenuclear issue. &quot;The salespeople aren't the best qualified topresent our position in this matter,&quot; says Ford Slater, a GEspokesman.   GE's position, he says, is that the company is &quot;simplyfollowing the nation's defense policy.&quot; Mr. Slater says themarketing people also underscore GE's involvement incommunity and philanthropic activities to show GE as acompany concerned with community welfare, not onecontaminating the environment with radiation, as theactivists claim.   GE Chairman John F. Welch Jr. asserted at the company'sstockholder meeting recently that it was the nation's &quot;strongdefense policy&quot; in the 1980s that &quot;brought about the changes,to a great extent, in Eastern Europe. And we are proud of thepart that we played in participating in that change.&quot;   The boycott has raised the question of whether health careis being compromised by anti-nuclear policy at the boycottinghospitals. GE, which has a dominant share of the medicaldiagnostic equipment market in the U.S., asserts it is. &quot;Webelieve that GE medical systems are used by so manyhealth-care institutions because they were judged on theircapacity to help provide a superior level of patient care,and that this is the proper criterion for evaluating suchtechnology,&quot; GE says in letters it has sent to somehospitals. &quot;Quality of care will surely suffer if politicalcriteria are substituted.&quot;   Mr. Baker, the radiologist at the Huguley MemorialHospital, disagrees. Other machines &quot;are just as good,&quot; hesays. &quot;The images {produced by the machines} are a littledifferent. It's something you get used to.&quot; Moreover, hesays, the Diasonic MRI machine was priced $250,000 lower thanGE's, and the Philips CT machine it purchased was $500,000lower. Still, he says, &quot;there was a lot of pressure from themembers of the hospital administration committee to buy GE&quot;because other hospitals in the area had purchased GEmachines.   Mr. Baker says the hospital committee investigateddiagnostic machines made by all major manufacturers andeventually &quot;accepted my recommendations.&quot;   Central Kansas Hospital leased its MRI machine fromDiasonics in the fall of 1989, at a cost of $1.4 million overfive to seven years. &quot;We did take performance as one of ourcriteria. We wouldn't buy equipment that was inferior,&quot; saysGemma Doll, a Dominican sister who was the head of thehospital board when it decided to boycott GE equipment.   &quot;GE sent its representatives to try to convince us to buytheir machines,&quot; she says. &quot;They pointed out GE's communityactivities. But we felt we had to take a stance.&quot;   A shareholder proposal calling for GE to get out of thenuclear business -- it makes neutron &quot;triggers&quot; for weaponsand nuclear fuels for commercial power plants -- has come upat GE annual meetings in one form or another every year since1980. The proposals have never managed to garner more than10% of the vote cast at the meetings. At the stockholdermeeting in April, the latest proposal received 6.2% of thevotes.   But the nuclear issue dominated the public discussionportion of the meeting. Despite a repeated urging by Mr.Welch that shareholders move on to another topic, activistspersisted. Says a spokesman for Infact, where three dozenfull-time staff are involved in the GE boycott: &quot;It's acampaign that won't go away.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
