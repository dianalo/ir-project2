Also Friday about 3,000 Moslem fundamentalists in Sudan, someshouting ``Down, down with Britain!'' demanded that Sudan breakrelations with the British government which has defended publicationof Rushdie's book ``The Satanic Verses.''   In Malaysia, the government banned the March 13 issue of Newsweekmagazine and the March 9 issues of the Hong Kong-based Far EasternEconomic Review for printing extracts from the book.   Many Moslems find the book blasphemous because it suggests theprophet Mohammed wrote the Koran instead of receiving it from Godand because its characters include prostitutes who take the names ofMohammed's wives.   Several countries including Bangladesh and Malaysia have bannedthe book, and Iran has offered $5.2 million to any Moslem who killsRushdie, an Indian-born Briton of Moslem upbringing.   Marchers in Dhaka chanted ``We will kill Rushdie'' and gatherednear the Secretariat, the headquarters of the government. Severalhundred policemen in riot gear followed the marchers but there wasno violence.   More than 15,000 followers of Jamaat-e-Islami, a fundamentalistMoslem party, held another rally in front of the city's main mosqueand religious leaders accused Zionists of ``conspiring against Islamand its prophet Mohammed.''   Seven of the country's top religious leaders have called for anationwide general strike on Tuesday to protest the book.   A youth organization has set up a 15-member death squad to killRushdie if he comes to Bangladesh. The group is led by Farooq Ahmed,who said the squad had no plans to go to London to kill Rushdie, whois in hiding somewhere in Britain.   The demonstrators in the Sudanese capital, Khartoum, urged thegovernment to break relations with Britain and boycott all its goods.   The protest, led by the fundamenalist National Islamic Front, isseen as the party's first sign of opposition to Prime Minister SadekMahdi.   Mahdi is in the process of forming a new broad-based governmentthat would start talks with Sudan's southern rebels to end the6-year-old civil war.   The National Islamic Front has said it will not join the newgovernment because negotiations and a peace treaty with the rebelSudan People's Liberation Army would mean a suspension of theIslamic Sharia law.   Malaysia's deputy home affairs minister, Megat Junid Megat Ayub,told reporters the Newsweek and Far Eastern Economic Review issueswere banned because the contents would have a deterimental effect onMoslems, whose faith is the official religion.   The Malaysian Home Affairs Ministry must receive a copy of allincoming foreign publications including newspapers. Sometimesarticles or parts of articles are blackened out and occasionally theentire issue is banned.</TEXT></DOC>
