The chip maker said net income climbed to $7.2 million, or 17 cents a share, from the year-earlier period's $257,000, or one cent a share. Revenue rose 54% to $92.5 million from $59.9 million.    LSI credited its big earnings gain in part to record orders for its application-specific integrated circuits, which are custom-produced chips used to perform tasks in products ranging from microcomputers to microwave ovens. While these chips currently represent only a small segment of the semiconductor market, LSI's success with them indicates the speed at which the market is growing.    &quot;The current operating environment for LSI Logic is more favorable now than at any time in the company's history,&quot; said its chairman and chief executive officer, Wilfred J. Corrigan, in a prepared release. He added that the momentum of the company's incoming orders &quot;has accelerated&quot; through the second quarter, with orders from the computer industry leading the way.    For every $100 of product it shipped during the period, LSI said, it received orders for $160 more. In contrast, the chip industry's June average was $115 of orders for $100 of product, a level considered to be very strong. LSI's &quot;book-to-bill ratio&quot; bodes well for revenue in coming periods, when the new orders are shipped. Mr. Corrigan said orders from the domestic market were &quot;particularly strong,&quot; but noted that markets in Europe, Japan and Canada are showing increasing demand.    For the six months, LSI had net income of $11.9 million, or 29 cents a share, compared with last year's $2.4 million, or six cents a share. Six-month revenue rose 44% to $165.5 million from $115 million.    Mr. Corrigan said LSI's second half &quot;continues to look promising, as long as the computer industry remains healthy,&quot; with continued gains in revenue and earnings.    LSI's earnings were released late in the trading day; in national over-the-counter trading, its shares closed at $12.375, off 25 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
