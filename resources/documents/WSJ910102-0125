The FTC has subpoenaed internal pricing documents from allmajor manufacturers of infant formula, as well as materialsfrom the national pediatricians' trade association, accordingto company officials and others familiar with theinvestigation.</LP><TEXT>   The commission's staff launched its investigation in May,in conjunction with a Senate hearing at which state welfareadministrators and lawmakers charged that major infantformula manufacturers had collaborated in setting prices.Issuing the subpoenas, which are compulsory orders to producedocuments, indicates that the FTC is intensifying itsinvestigation.   The companies involved, as well as the trade association,the American Academy of Pediatrics, have all denied anywrongdoing.   The firms that have received subpoenas in recent monthsare: Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, Ill.; Bristol-MyersSquibb Co., New York; American Home Products Corp., New York;Carnation Co., the Los Angeles-based unit of the Swissconglomerate Nestle S.A.; and Gerber Products Co., Fremont,Mich.   Deborah Feinstein, an FTC antitrust official, saidallegations of collusion leading to infant formula priceincreases are of particular concern because the formula is animportant element of the federal food program for poor womenand children. The price of the formula has risen sharply inrecent years.   As a matter of FTC policy, Ms. Feinstein declined toconfirm or deny that subpoenas were issued. She saidinvestigators haven't concluded that there have been anyviolations of federal antitrust laws.   Spokesmen for Bristol-Myers, American Home Products'Wyeth-Ayerst unit and Abbott Laboratories said the infantformula industry is very competitive and denied that therewas any collusion. Officials of Carnation and GerberProducts, which have small shares of the U.S. market, didn'treturn telephone calls seeking comment. The recipients ofsubpoenas said they were cooperating with the FTC.   The New York Times reported Monday that subpoenas wereissued.   In testimony before a Senate subcommittee in May, theFTC's antitrust chief, Kevin Arquit, said the infant formulaindustry &quot;appears to be highly concentrated,&quot; which couldfacilitate collusion. He added, &quot;We are told that the . . .industry is characterized by frequent, substantial andparallel price increases.&quot;   The pediatricians' trade association received a subpoenabecause of its longstanding opposition to consumeradvertising by infant formula makers, a position which FTCinvestigators suspect may inhibit price competition.</TEXT></DOC>
