Sheba is a chimpanzee who knows how to count.   The chimp, who lives at Ohio State University's animallaboratory here, is one of only two monkeys in the world able tocount, and the only one that understands the concept of zero, saidSally Boysen, director of the lab's primate cognition project.   Boysen said last week she believes that ability is a major stepforward in defining the cognitive processes of higher primates andtheir similarities to those of humans.   Boysen, who said the ability to count objects involves adifferent cognitive process than learning languages, was one of theparticipants in early studies that showed higher primates can learnlanguage.   More than a decade ago, Koko, a female gorilla, and Washoe, afemale chimp, learned to use sign language to communicate withhumans.   But counting is a new research goal, and a hobby Sheba indulgesin when she is not playing with her keepers, with the four otherapes at the lab or with Boysen's dog Schuyler, who is her bestfriend.   The chimp also dials telephone numbers at random when no one iswatching.   Sheba, a lab-born chimp owned by The Columbus Zoo, will appearon ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America'' this week and is the subjectof a People magazine story due out this month.   The surrogate mother-daughter relationship between Boysen andSheba and their mutual teasing has helped the chimp ignore theattention and get to work.   In a recent demonstration, Sheba was placed on the floor infront of a small, rectangular yellow plate. Above that was placedplastic squares with numbers ranging from zero to seven, mixedrandomly. Boysen then placed four apples on the plate.   ``OK, Sheba. We're going to count some apples. How many?''Boysen asked. Sheba, fighting a desire to mug for a photographer,touched each apple, then pointed to the number five and looked toBoysen for approval.   ``You know that is not five apples. Try to tell me how many,''Boysen said. Sheba counted again and pointed to the number seven.   It took another try and a hallway conference between Boysen andSheba before the ape finally ignored the photographer and pickedthe correct number. Sheba was rewarded with a kiss and a handful ofMandamp;Ms and gumdrops.   Boysen has worked with Sheba for almost five years, and says theassociation has been rewarding from the start, even though Shebawould rather be playing.   ``They have such a short attention span,'' Boysen said. ``Atfirst she wouldn't try at all. But then she began to show us shecould learn fast.''</TEXT></DOC>
