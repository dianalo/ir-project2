The Hardee Power Station, to be built in Hardee County, Fla., and finished by November 1992, will primarily provide back-up power to Seminole Electric Coop Inc. and supply electricity to Tampa Electric.    Fairfield, Conn.-based GE, which will have responsibility for the project through its completion, will join with Metric Constructors Inc. of Charlotte, N.C., a member of Jones Group, to build the plant.    The Hardee Power Station will be the first wholesale power facility owned by Teco Power Services, which was formed recently to develop and operate cogeneration and independent power plants. Teco Power Services is a unit of Teco Energy Inc., a holding company for Tampa Electric and other companies. </TEXT></DOC>
