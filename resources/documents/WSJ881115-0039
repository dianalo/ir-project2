For example, the average rate on new three-month Treasury bills sold yesterday by the government rose to 7.82%. That was up from 7.54% a week ago and was the highest auction average since April 1985.    Several analysts expect the Federal Reserve to push rates even higher by year end in an effort to bolster the dollar in the currency markets. Some also predict that banks will raise their prime, or base, lending rates to 10 1/4%, or possibly even 10 1/2%, from the 10% level that has prevailed since August.    Zane Brown, fixed-income manager at Equitable Capital Management Corp., contended that the dollar will drop further in the next few weeks. He also said the Fed might react by raising its discount rate, the fee it charges on loans to banks and savings institutions, by early December. The discount rate now stands at 6.5%.    Yesterday, though, the dollar rose. That helped long-term bond prices erase most of their early-morning declines to finish the day only slightly lower than late last week. Long-term Treasury bonds declined about 1/4 of a point, or $2.50 for each $1,000 face amount, from last Thursday's closing levels. The yield on benchmark 30-year bonds rose slightly to about 9% from 8.98%.    The Treasury will sell about $9 billion of new 30-year bonds Thursday. Treasury officials said the long-awaited 30-year bond sale finally can be held because President Reagan signed a measure that includes a provision increasing the government's long-term bond issuance authority.    Several money managers say there is little incentive for them to buy 30-year bonds because they can earn nearly the same return on much shorter-term issues. For example, the difference between three-year and 30-year Treasury issues now stands at only about a third of a percentage point.    Nevertheless, some analysts expect strong demand from foreign investors for the new 30-year Treasury bonds. Arnold X. Moskowitz, a senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., predicts Japanese investors will buy large amounts because of the wide gap betweeen U.S. bond yields and those on comparable Japanese government issues. The difference now stands at about 4 1/2 percentage points. Mr. Moskowitz estimated that Japanese investors bought &quot;at least 35%&quot; of the $9.5 billion of new 10-year Treasury notes auctioned last Wednesday.    Investor demand for the new bonds probably will depend heavily on what happens to the dollar over the next few days, several financial executives agreed. Thus, Treasury officials &quot;probably will try to stabilize the dollar between now and Thursday&quot; to help the new 30-year bonds sell briskly, said Robert D. Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International.    A major test for the dollar and bond markets comes tomorrow, when the government releases its September trade report. According to the average estimate of 14 analysts polled by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report, the merchandise trade deficit shrank to a seasonally adjusted $10.5 billion from $12.2 billion in August.    Treasury Securities   Although Treasury bond prices edged lower, they finished near their highest levels of the day.    Trading volume was light because of nervousness about the government's trade report to be released tomorrow as well as the Treasury's sale of new 30-year bonds Thursday, several dealers said. In when-issued trading late yesterday, the new 30-year bonds were quoted at 8.97%.    The Treasury said its bond auction will be held at noon EST, rather than the usual 1 p.m. time, because a 52-week bill auction is set for 1 p.m.    The new bonds will have an issue date of Nov. 22 and will come due Nov. 15, 2018. Tenders for the bonds will be available in minimum denominations of $1,000 and must be received by noon EST Thursday at the Treasury or at Federal Reserve banks or branches.    The Treasury said its new 30-year bonds will be dated Nov. 15 even though they won't be issued until Nov. 22. There will be accrued interest payable, but the amount will be determined after the auction, the Treasury said. The amount of accrued interest for each $1,000 bond will be reported in the auction results Thursday afternoon.    An index of long-term Treasury bonds compiled by Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. fell 1.45 points to 1247.13. That was just below the high of 1248.80. The low was 1241.47. The total return on the bonds in the index stands at 7.97% for the year to date. Total return includes both price changes and interest income.    In yesterday's activity, the Treasury's 9 1/8% bonds due 2018 declined 6/32 of a point from last Thursday to 101 9/32. The yield rose slightly to 9% from 8.98%. The new 10-year notes were quoted at 99 26/32, down 2/32, to yield 8.90%.    Three-year Treasury notes were quoted at 8.66%, up slightly from 8.63% last Thursday.    The Treasury securities market was closed here last Friday in observance of Veterans Day.    At the Treasury's auction of short-term bills yesterday, rates jumped to their highest levels since early 1985. The rate on six-month bills climbed to 7.87% from 7.71% the previous week.    Here are details:   Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.                                 13-Week          26-Week    Applications .......... $22,518,405,000  $23,284,090,000    Accepted bids .......... $7,202,555,000   $7,204,290,000    Accepted at low price               73%              16%    Accepted noncompet'ly    $1,105,195,000     $947,575,000    Average price (Rate)     98.023 (7.82%)   96.021 (7.87%)    High price (Rate) ...... 98.044 (7.74%)   96.036 (7.84%)    Low price (Rate) ....... 98.018 (7.84%)   96.016 (7.88%)    Coupon equivalent ......          8.09%            8.31%   Both issues are dated Nov. 17. The 13-week bills mature Feb. 16, 1989, and the 26-week bills mature May 18, 1989.   Municipal Issues   A modest rebound in the dollar and long Treasurys helped push municipal bonds to session highs, unchanged to 3/8 point above levels of late last week.   Prices of tax-exempts held to tight ranges through the afternoon, with light dealer-oriented trades dominating. Traders say uncertainty over the direction of the dollar, an important factor in recent municipal rate changes, was a primary cause of the lack of activity.   Among bellwether issues, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority's 7.20% bonds due 2018 rose 1/4 point to 94 5/8, after having held unchanged on the day for most of the morning and early afternoon at 94 3/8 bid.   The Turnpike Authority bonds, the municipal market's closest approximation to a bellwether security, now yield 7.66%.   Corporate Issues   Prices finished the day little changed to off 1/8 point in light trading.   Among new issues was a $225 million junk bond issue for Ampex Group Inc. The company's eight-year senior notes were priced at par to yield 13.25%.   While new issuance was slim, underwriters began circulating price talk for a few junk bond issues that are slated for pricing later in the week.   Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. has a two-part, $400 million debt offering scheduled for pricing in the middle of the week through First Boston Corp.   Also slated for one day this week is Specialty Equipment Cos.' $150 million of 12-year senior subordinated debentures, proceeds of which will be used to repay bridge financing that was part of that company's recent $500 million leveraged buy-out.   Foreign Bonds   Japanese government bonds declined, finishing at their lows of the day, after the dollar recovered against the yen.   The foreign exchange market clearly is the biggest factor for the Japanese government bond market at the moment, traders said. Nervousness also is widespread over Emperor Hirohito's failing health, and the possibility that the Bank of Japan could drive up short-term interest rates in tandem with the U.S. Federal Reserve.   Japan's benchmark No. 105, 5% issue due 1997 closed at the day's high yield of 4.57% in the interdealer market. That was up 1.5 basis points on the day. The yield on the session was as low as 4.515%. The closing yield represented a price of 102.75, down 0.10 yen for each 100 yen face value.   In West Germany, government bonds ended the day flat to down 0.10 point in narrow range trading. Attention focused on the federal railway's two billion mark, 10-year issue, which came with a 6 3/8% coupon at 99 3/4 to yield 6.41%. It was quoted late in the day at a yield of 6.57%.   Separately, Bonn's benchmark 6 3/4% issue due August 1998 closed unchanged at 102.65 to yield 6.371%. Among Euromark issues, both the Kingdom of Belgium 5 1/2% issue due 1993 and the World Bank's 6% issue due 1998 fell 0.10 point in thin trading ahead of the U.S. trade data. The Belgium issue was quoted at 99.80 bid to yield 5.55%, and the World Bank issue at 98.40 bid to yield 6.22%.   In London, British government bonds ended largely unchanged as it became apparent that the government's policy of high interest rates isn't having an immediate impact on consumer spending.   Analysts don't expect the government to raise base rates any further, especially as it was warned against such a move by the Bank of England last week. But they say the news confirms that base rates will have stay up at 12% well into next year.   The volume of retail sales jumped 1.9% in October from September. Analysts had expected at most a modest increase of about 0.3% and some had forecast a decline.   Britain's benchmark 11 3/4% issue due 2003/2007, which earlier rose to a high of 116 26/32, ended unchanged at 116 15/32 to yield 9.60%.   Mortgage-Backed Securities   Prices of Ginnie Mae securities were down on the day, with some ending above their session lows.   Ginnie Mae 9 1/2% securities for November delivery were down 6/32 to 97 28/32, having traded as low as 97 26/32.   The spread of the 9 1/2% bonds to the Treasury's 10-year note widened to 107 basis points from 100 basis points Friday.   Ginnie Mae 9% securities were down 8/32 at 95, and the 10% securities, at 100 18/32, were down 4/32.   In other mortgage-backed markets, 9 1/2% Freddie Mac securities were down 2/32 at 97 20/32, and the Freddie Mac 10% securities, at 100 2/32, were down 4/32.   Fannie Mae 9 1/2% securities were down 2/32 at 98 2/32, as were the 10% securities, at 100 30/32.</TEXT></DOC>
