These thrifts reported their capital position incorrectly in filings to federal regulators, and the erroneous data were listed in a table that ran in Monday's editions. Northwest Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, Woodward, Okla., had a ratio of 5.2% based on an amended filing that reclassified certain assets. The table listed a ratio reported in an earlier filing. Charter Bank, Hattiesburg, Miss., had a ratio of 2.25%. The amount was misstated in the table because of an error by regulators. Southwest Savings Association, Dallas, had net interest income of $42.7 million as of March 31, on an annualized basis. A different amount was listed in a table in Monday's editions because the thrift reported federal cash assistance as &quot;other income&quot; rather than net interest income in a regulatory filing.
