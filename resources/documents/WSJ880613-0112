Soviet and Western officials say Moscow's interest in the EC, a reversal of earlier Soviet policies, also signals Mikhail Gorbachev's eagerness to give shape to his much-touted but vague vision of a &quot;common European home.&quot;    Moscow and East Berlin formally requested diplomatic relations with the 12-nation European Community last week after the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, or Comecon, the Eastern bloc's trading group, initialed a joint declaration that will establish its official ties with the EC. The declaration, agreed upon after the Soviet bloc made some significant concessions, is due to be signed by both sides in Luxembourg later this month.    Comecon officials are hailing the accord between the two blocs as the necessary first step toward setting up broad trade agreements between the EC and individual Comecon countries. &quot;The signing of the declaration opens up a venue for a new stage of interaction -- the stage of long-term cooperation,&quot; says Marin Marinov, deputy secretary of Comecon.    Czechoslovakia, Romania and Hungary are currently negotiating long-term commercial agreements with the EC, while Bulgaria, Poland and the Soviet Union are holding exploratory talks, according to Comecon officials. East Germany already enjoys broad access to the Common Market because it has a closer diplomatic and economic relationship with West Germany than is usual for an Eastern bloc nation.    The EC will be the first international economic body the Soviet Union has drawn close to since Mr. Gorbachev took office in 1985. Moscow has said it is interested in playing a larger role in the world economy, but so far its only other attempt -- to join the general agreement on tariffs and trade -- has been rebuffed.    Through their individual trade agreements with the EC, Soviet bloc countries hope to boost their exports, seeking lower tariffs and higher quotas for their products. Comecon officials say they want to avoid being shut out of the West European market after 1992, the EC's deadline for removing its internal trade barriers. And they aren't hiding their interest in more open access to Western technology and scientific research.    Ivan Ivanov, the second-ranking Soviet foreign trade official, says that a Soviet bilateral agreement with the EC should be broad-based, including cooperation in industry, science and technology. And Comecon's Mr. Marinov, describing the absence of official relations between the two European blocs as &quot;an anachronism,&quot; says he hopes that Eastern Europe will be able to share in the results of the EC's &quot;Eureka&quot; program, which links Western European firms on specific high-tech projects.    &quot;There is space for joint research and exchange of results obtained in the research,&quot; Mr. Marinov says.    While it's not certain that the EC will go along with such requests, Mr. Gorbachev is not alone in having greater European integration as a goal. West Germany in particular appears eager to bring about closer ties between East and West Europe. Bonn currently holds the EC presidency and was instrumental in bringing about the EC-Comecon political declaration.    Western diplomats familiar with the declaration say that its text is vague but its existence is significant.    For years, the Soviet Union and its allies spurned formal contacts with the EC, condemning it as a quasi-military grouping linked to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. As recently as last month, a Soviet government spokesman warned Austria that it would compromise its status as a neutral country if it joined the EC.    Moreover, establishing formal ties with the EC forced Moscow to do some nimble diplomatic footwork over the status of West Berlin. The EC insists in all its agreements on a &quot;Berlin clause&quot; that ensures the Western part of the divided city is treated as a member of the community. Comecon resolved the touchy issue by agreeing to such a clause, but at the same time making a unilateral statement emphasizing that West Berlin is a special political entity that is not governed by West Germany, as defined by a 1971 agreement between the Soviet Union, the U.S., France and Britain.    &quot;We proceeded from the fact that the existing close economic links between West Berlin and the Federal Republic of Germany are a reality which we do not question,&quot; Comecon's Mr. Marinov said. </TEXT></DOC>
