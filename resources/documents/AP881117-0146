One person was killed and 10 were injured when police opened fireto break up an anti-government demonstration in the north-centralKurunegala district, a government communique said.   In Colombo, Sinhalese radicals threw bombs at a meeting beingaddressed by Ossie Abeygoonasekara, one of the three candidates fornext month's presidential elections, police said.   At least 40 people suffered minor injuries in the attack and anensuing stampede, said officials, who were not identified inaccordance with briefing rules.   Military officials said three people were killed and one wasinjured when a bomb was thrown at a video center just south ofColombo.   They said the video center was attacked because it stayed openlast week when the People's Liberation Front, a militant Sinhalesegroup, called for an anti-government strike.   The victims were shop employees.   At least 13 people were killed by radical Sinhalese in the southand center of the island, and three Sinhalese men were shot andkilled by Tamil rebels in the northeast, said police and militaryofficials.   The attacks occurred Wednesday and Thursday. Officials said amongthe victims were four government supporters, a bus driver, a schoolprincipal, two employees of the Colombo port, a civilian clerk andhis nephew.   The port employees were involved in compiling lists of employees'names so police could escort them to work during a strike at theport last week, sources said.   The military officials gave no reasons for the other killings,but the victims were believed to be Sinhalese who defied the strike.   Sinhalese militants are agitating for the resignation ofPresident Junius R. Jayewardene, himself a Sinhalese. They areopposed to an accord Jayewardene signed that is aimed at endingTamil rebels' five-year war for autonomy.   Sinhalese radicals say the accord, signed July 29, 1987, makestoo many concessions to the minority Tamils, who comprise 18 percentof the 16 million population.   The main Tamil rebel group, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam,has refused to accept the accord, saying it does not go far enough.   The People's Liberation Front stepped up its anti-governmentcampaign last week and called for a four-day strike in the south,which crippled business in the Sinhalese heartland and caused foodand gasoline shortages.   Jayewardene hit back by ordering troops to open fire atanti-government demonstrations and decreeing the death penalty foranyone convicted of instigating strikes.   Jayewardene is to leave office in January and elections to choosehis successor are scheduled Dec. 19. The Front says he should resignimmediately.   The group called for a boycott of the elections and hasthreatened to kill all the candidates.</TEXT></DOC>
