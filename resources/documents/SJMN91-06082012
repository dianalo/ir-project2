The granddaddy of all modern comic caperfilms is still one of the most enjoyable. A group of self-assured thieves(including Melina Mercouri) sets out to steal a jeweled dagger from theimpregnable Topkapi Palace Museum in Istanbul, enlisting the aid of areluctant, bungling Peter Ustinov.;    (box) &quot;The Pink Panther&quot; (1964;CBS/Fox). The Pink Panther is a diamond -- and notorious jewel thief thePhantom (David Niven) has his eye on it. But how can it be at risk, when it'sbeing guarded by the dauntless Inspector Clouseau (Peter Sellers)? DirectorBlake Edwards combines the sophistication of Cary Grant's cat burglar in &quot;ToCatch a Thief&quot; with the slapstick of -- well, Inspector Clouseau, in thisromp.;    (box) &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot; (1979; Warner; rated PG). No oneever imagined robbing a speeding train -- until the so-called &quot;Crime of theCentury&quot; in 1856. Sean Connery is the mastermind and Donald Sutherland hisskilled &quot;cracksman&quot; in writer-director Michael Crichton's exciting and elegantembellishment of the true story of the Victorian team that &quot;took&quot; the train.;   (box) &quot;Kelley's Heroes&quot; (1970; MGM/UA; PG). It's not really illegal to emptya bank behind enemy lines, is it? Clint Eastwood's loophole logic allows himto lead his troop of crack soldiers (and cracked soldiers, like hippie DonaldSutherland) behind German lines in WWII to &quot;liberate&quot; some Nazi gold. And theycome darn close to winning the war for Patton in the process.;    (box) &quot;TheHot Rock&quot; (1970; CBS/Fox; PG). Robert Redford doesn't realize that the crewfor his tightly planned jewel heist has an extra member: Murphy, the guy whoinvented the Law. The fun in this adaptation of Donald Westlake's novel liesin watching the quirky crooks squirm when every plan goes awry, and everysolution leads to more messy setbacks.;    (box) &quot;A Fish Called Wanda&quot; (1988;CBS/Fox; R). Kevin Kline won an Oscar as the irascible rascal planning a heistwith Jamie Lee Curtis, both of whom plot to use lawyer John Cleese (who wrotethe script) as a dupe in this wacky, romantic robbery riot.;    (box) &quot;TheLavender Hill Mob&quot; (1951; HBO). Alec Guinness shines as a mild-mannered bankclerk who plans the perfect heist and the perfect cover: melt the gold intotiny kitschy statues of the Eiffel Tower. But the getaway gets complicated,naturally, ending a wildly comic chase.;    (box) &quot;The Ladykillers&quot; (1955;HBO). Guinness again, this time as mastermind of an off-kilter crew of bankrobbers (including Peter Sellers), accidentally foiled by their sweet oldlandlady in this droll, original black comedy.;    (box) &quot;The Brink's Job&quot;(1978; Warner; PG). Director William Friedkin used a true story as the basisfor this laid-back, darkly realistic film about a motley crew of klutzy crooks(including Peter Falk, Warren Oates and Allen Garfield) who stumble into ahuge sum of easy-pickings cash in 1950.;    (box) &quot;Ocean's 11&quot; (1960; Warner).Who was the yardstick of Cool before the Swingin' '60s? The Rat Pack: FrankSinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr. and all the rest. Here they driftthrough a twist-ending romp about former war buddies who use their militaryskills to rob five Vegas casinos simultaneously.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  D Scott Apel column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910322  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  9E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  645  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday March 22, 199100082012,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
