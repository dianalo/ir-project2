(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Autoworkers at Mazda Motor Corp.'s onlyU.S. car assembly plant have ratified a labor contract that willboost their salaries to levels comparable to workers at Ford MotorCo., officials said.   United Auto Workers spokesman Karl Mantyla said 90 percent ofLocal 3000 members who voted Thursday supported the contract, whichcovers more than 2,000 workers at the plant in Flat Rock, south ofDetroit. The workers make the MX6 for Mazda and the Probe for Ford.   The agreement, reached Monday, went into effect March 7 and willrun through March 3, 1991. It will give Mazda's U.S. workers wageparity with Ford workers by 1991, the UAW said.   ``We are pleased with the results of our negotiations,'' saidHenry G. Schultz, Mazda director of labor relations.   ``This agreement proves anew that the UAW can workconstructively with anyone who chooses to invest in America and whoseeks a constructive relationship with us,'' said UAW PresidentOwen Bieber.   Ford assembly workers, whose UAW contract expires in 1990, earnan average $14.02 an hour. Mazda workers earn $11.11, which willgrow to at least $14.32 an hour by 1989, UAW spokesman Frank Joycesaid.   In addition, beginning in 1989, Mazda workers will receiveannual lump-sum payments equal to 3 percent of their wages, theunion said. The average worker should receive about $2,500.   Ford workers will receive the 3 percent bonuses in the secondand third years of their contract.   Like the Ford contract, the Mazda contract also includescost-of-living adjustments. The Mazda pact also contains acommitment to provide job security as long as the company remainscompetitive, the union and company said.   If Ford workers win a wage increase in 1990 negotiations, Mazdaworkers' salaries will be adjusted to match.   Employees with three months service prior to negotiation of theagreement will receive a signing bonus of $750. Other employeeswill get $250.   Mazda also agreed to try to negotiate a profit-sharing planwhile the current three-year agreement is in effect. Ifnegotiations fail, Mazda has pledged to negotiate a profit-sharingpact for the next contract.   In return for the Mazda concessions, the UAW allowed the companyto remain flexible by requiring fewer job classifications and lessrestrictive work rules than in other auto plants.   The UAW has been unable to organize plants in the United Statesoperated by 100 percent Japanese-owned automakers, including HondaMotor Co. and Nissan Motor Co. Ford owns 25 percent of Mazda.   ``We are delighted that workers at Mazda's U.S. plant will enjoythe benefits of a fine UAW contract,'' Bieber said. ``The agreementbreaks new ground in several areas of importance to the union whileassuring Mazda the ability to offer well-built, high-qualityautomobiles in the marketplace.''</TEXT></DOC>
