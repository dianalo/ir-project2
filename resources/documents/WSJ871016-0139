Dornier System is a unit of Daimler-Benz AG, the West German maker of Mercedes-Benz autos.    Martin Marietta, a Bethesda, Md.-based aerospace and data-systems concern, said four follow-up options could bring the total value of the contract to $45 million. Deliveries are to begin in 1989.    A payload carrier cradles a spacecraft until it reaches orbit.
