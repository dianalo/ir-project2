 With peopletalking about the triumph of liberal democracy, the opening of the EasternBloc economies, the unification of the European market, earthquakes bothmetaphorical and real, it's likely that IS management in the last decade ofthe 20th century may indeed be dramatically different than it was in the1980s.andM;If the 1980s brought the personal computer and the empowerment of the enduser, the emergence of a business culture for IS and the first steps towardfreeing users and companies from the shackles of proprietary systems, thenthe 1990s may well see not only the continuation of these trends but perhapstheir fulfillment, as well.andM;But beyond the present day realities that everyone is grappling with lies theemergence of a new order for the new decade, one that will be marked by everfaster technological and market change, shorter product life cycles and theconsequent need to adapt--managerially, organizationally andtechnologically--with rapidity and frequency.andP;  The new order will embrace thenew economics of the industry, the changing work force and, perhaps mostimportant, the new attitudes of users.andP;  Goodbye paternalism, helloentrepreneurialism.andP;  Those that don't adapt will surely perish; those that domay find themselves at the beginning of a new era of computing so vast in itsscope and so sweeping in its implications as to seem that we have progressedfrom one geological age to another far more advanced.andM;The recurrent themes of the day--productivity, interoperability, opensystems, standards, cooperative processing, globalization, a business focusfor IS--all underscore the massive rationalization of IS now under way inboth user and supplier organizations.andP;  All parts of the business, from thechief executive to the route salesperson, can now compute; the mystique thatonce was in gone.andP;  Now, computing must fulfill its original promise--to be atool to drive business success.andP;  And the key to that success is betterapplications--built faster, integrated, easier to use and easier to maintain.andM;How will this goal be realized in the 1990s, and what hurdles will have to becleared to do so?andP;  Duwayne Peterson, executive vice president of operationssystems and telecommunications at Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. says: &quot;From a technicalstandpoint, the big challenge is in applications development productivity.andM;&quot;We've taken our cost growth in the operations systems side of the firm froma 25% compound growth rate to a flat or negative growth rate.andP;  We've gonefrom seven data centers to two.andP;  We've worked very consciously to squash downthe infrastructure.andP;  But at no time did we stop our strategic initiative.andO;We're still rolling out new systems.andP;  At the same time, we have cut costs, wehave upgraded the environment.&quot;andM;Peterson points to two critical factors enabling Merrill Lynch to producemore for less.andP;  &quot;Technology costs are coming down, and we've done a muchbetter job of negotiating purchasing.andP;  We sat down and had an IBM/Amdahlshootout.andP;  We saw bargains we've never seen before.&quot;andP;  Laughing, Petersonnotes the almost magical effect on IBM'S discounts produced by the presenceof a plug-compatible machine: &quot;We always keep an Amdahl machine around.andP;  Allour disk products are Amdahl.&quot;andP;  However, Peterson's most succinct recipe forproductivity lies in his basic approach to automation.andP;  &quot;Go back and changethe whole job, don't just automate yesterday's job.&quot;andM;Peterson sees the creativity necessary to increase productivity coming from&quot;the deployment of workstations and PCs into the fabric of the workplace.andO;The result: a matrix of user/builders feeding the organization with thetechnology it will need to thrive.andP;  By more people working at [the problem],more creativity is going to come out of it.andP;  More stuff will flow out.andP;  If wetry to form these huge projects and huge groups, it's just not going to befast enough.&quot;andM;Allan Z. Loren, former MIS manager for insurer Cigna Corp. and now presidentof Apple Computer Inc.'s Apple U.S.A.andP;  Division, says that the PC will playthe crucial role in increasing productivity throughout the decade.andO;&quot;Companies will have to become more productive in the next decade, and therewill be fewer and fewer people to draw on.andP;  There will be labor shortages.&quot;andO;So far, says Loren, technology's promise of greater productivity has beenstymied by difficult to use systems.andP;  &quot;So far, it's been dehumanizing andunfriendly,&quot; Loren adds.andM;Apple is looking to the customer for a definition of its business in the1990s.andP;  &quot;We must become more and more that kind of company that looks at howit does business from a customer's perspective,&quot; Loren says.andP;  &quot;You're goingto have to take into account how a customer wants to do business and set up aprogram to do it.andP;  And very likely perspectives will change from customer tocustomer.&quot;andM;A Crying Need for CASEandM;One of the biggest jobs of the coming decade may be remaking the old jobs.andO;And here again productivity is the goal.andP;  Scott Shultz, general manager ofthe Information Engineering Associates division of chemical giant DuPontsays: &quot;The next phase of activity, I think, is going to be rebuilding thetraditional institutional set of applications.andP;  The back office is going tobe rebuilt.&quot;andM;Shultz says it's inevitable.andP;  &quot;Somewhere between 80 and 90% ofdata-processing staffs are tied up maintaining these old back office systems,and we can't tolerate that.andP;  That's too expensive, and it takes resourcesaway from the creative side of the house needed to build the more strategicapplications we need in order to compete, in order to help our businessgrow.&quot;andM;For Shultz, the answer is computer-aided software engineering technology.andO;&quot;What we're going to have to do is either reengineer or rebuild theseapplications to get them embedded in CASE technology.andP;  We've found in DuPontthat when you build an application with CASE technology, it usually requiressomewhere between 75 and 90% less resources to maintain it.&quot;andM;Software producers, as might be expected, agree that CASE technology willplay a crucial role in the 1990s, a period some are starting to refer to asthe applications decade.andP;  But some also see other factors at play.andP;  Says JeanLuc Badault, chief executive of Must Software Interational in Norwalk, Conn.:andO;&quot;We manufacture software, and manufacturing software, like manufacturingautomobiles or aircraft, requires better methodology, better tools, in orderto improve our own productivity.andP;  The concern is to put in place the rightmethodology and the right tools--CASE tools, in particular--to improve ourown productivity.andP;  We have to systematically improve our products and shortenour manufacturing cycle to react more quickly to the demands of themarketplace.&quot;andM;Productivity is also the goal of the coming interconnected enterprise.andP;  SaysWayland R. Hicks, executive vice president for marketing and customeroperations at Stamford, Conn.-based Xerox Corp.: &quot;Large customers will movemore rapidly towards local area networks both within buildings and betweenthem.andP;  Telecommunications and networking capability will have an importantrole.andP;  Smaller customers will be interested in multifunctional devices,products that can do more than one function.&quot;andM;But will the push for networking result in organizational changes thatcompanies will have to deal with?andP;  Jon Shirley, president and chief operatingofficer of Microsoft Corp., thinks so.andM;He figures that large corporations will have to become more centralized inthe next 10 years if they succumb to pressures to hook up all their users tonetwork servers.andP;  &quot;Companies will have to be centralized to satisfy users.andO;Microsoft customers, like the West Coast aerospace companies, are examples ofdecentralized firms, where decisions are often made at the departmentallevel.andP;  That will have to change if you hook them up to network servers,&quot;Shirley says.andM;By the end of the 1990s, most corporations will have the vast majority oftheir PCs hooked to corporatewide networks, Shirley believes.andP;  Electronicmail will be ubiquitous by the end of the decade, &quot;available to everybody ona network.andP;  It is an example of something that's useless if everybody is noton it.andM;&quot;If we look at things you cannot do on a PC today and would like to do, theycan be solved by multimedia computing with CD-ROM players, better sound andbetter graphics by today's standards.andP;  Faster processors and a fair amount ofDRAM [memory chip] supplies in the next three or four years will also make it[multimedia technology] more affordable,&quot; Shirley predicts.andM;Open Systems Will Gather SteamandM;Open systems, too, will effect much change in the IS community.andP;  The wordsopen and standards are on the lips of many IS managers looking toward the newdecade.andP;  Two forces are driving the push toward open systems.andP;  First, thenever-ending quest for independence from vendors and, second, the need toconnect and interoperate the islands of automation that exist throughout thecorporate universe.andM;As a word, however, open means different things to different people.andP;  FranDramis, managing director of the Business Technology Organization at New YorkCity investment house Salomon Brothers Inc., defines open as &quot;a more generictype of technology: new networking, new PCs, new workstations, newdatabases--as vendor nonspecific as possible.&quot;andM;But while open has buzzed in the industry for the past few years, there arenow convincing numbers and available products to back up the promises.andO;According to the organizers of UNIX Expo, held in New York City in November1989, 30% more people from corporate MIS shops attended this year's show thancame the previous year.andP;  Bernard Goldsmith, chief executive officer ofHolmdel, N.J.-based financial services firm The Updata Group Inc., says: &quot;Ithink UNIX is really here.andP;  Software companies are now saying 'I've got tomove the UNIX platform to broaden my market.andP;  If I pick UNIX, I've got areally broad base of users.'&quot;andM;Accelerating interest in UNIX, predicts Richard W. Miller, president of WangLaboratories Inc. in Lowell, Mass., will be the unification of the Europeanmarket in 1992.andP;  &quot;UNIX will be more and more important to all players in ourindustry because it is important in Europe, more important than it is in theUnited States today.andM;&quot;From a market standpoint, 1992 and the European economic community are, Ithink, a major force that will affect our industry in future years.andP;  On aglobal basis, we're beginning to understand that the United States is lessthan half of the worldwide industry,&quot; he says.andP;  The U.S., &quot;percentage isshrinking, and clearly both Europe and the Pacific Rim [percentages] areincreasing.andP;  With 1992, one has to think about marketing and responding toEuropean needs in a much different way than we have been able to in the past.andM;The signs are good that the confusion in the UNIX camp may soon end.andP;  Thepartnership between ATandamp;T and Sun Microsystems Inc. that grew into UNIXInternational Inc. has met deadlines in coming up with UNIX System V, release4.andP;  And, attracting the largest crowds at the UNIX Expo was a glitzymultivendor booth offering a demo of interoperability and portability among17 vendors' machines--from Toshiba Corp. mainframes to PCs and workstationsfrom Dell Computer Corp., Sun, Olivetti and Unisys Corp.andM;Meanwhile, at the IBM booth hyping Big Blue's UNIX offering, AIX, productionvalues were high, but attendance seemed sparse.andP;  Contacts are beingestablished between UNIX International and the IBM-backed consortium, theOpen Software Foundation, which could lead to an early rapprochment betweenthe warring UNIX camps.andP;  A single UNIX operating system standard could make areality of the UNIX myth.andM;Another part of the UNIX battle may prove to be a nonissue.andP;  UNIx backers sayit's likely that competing graphical user interfaces--Open Look, Motif,Apple's Mac, etc.--will presumably all be made to work with the winning UNIXOS.andM;Seeking to reassure users that what's called &quot;open&quot; or &quot;standard&quot; truly is asadvertised, vendors are forming consortiums.andP;  The result will be a slew ofproducts from various vendors bearing brand names that attempt to guaranteecommon operating systems, interfaces or languages.andP;  Among those alreadyslapping brands on approved products are such organizations as theCorporation for Open Systems, 88 Open, SQL/Access and X/Open.andM;How Will SAA Play?andM;But where does industry leader IBM with its Systems Application ARchitecture(SAA) fit in?andM;First, how's Big Blue doing?andP;  According to data from the 1985 DATAMATIONsurvey of the top 100 IS vendors, IBM in 1984 owned a 37.5% share of the PCmarket, 22.3% of the mini market and 58.5% of the mainframe market.andP;  In themost recent survey, things have decidedly changed.andP;  IBM took only 25.5% ofthe PC market, 18.2% of the mini market (including 25,000 AS/400s) and 40.1%of the mainframe market (see &quot;The DATAMATION 100,&quot; June 15, 1985 and March15, 1989).andP;  True, Armonk has improved its software market share slightlysince mid-decade and computer services are up.andP;  But peripherals are down.andO;And, most embarrassing, Wall Street's passion for IBM has cooled along withprofits.andM;A cooling nova, however, still packs a lot of heat.andP;  More than $60 billion inannual revenues rolled in last year, which is proving ample to finance anexpensive campaign to win the hearts and minds of IS.andP;  The campaign is calledSAA.andP;  Uncle Armonk wants you.andP;  IBM has signed up many third-party softwareand service companies to advance the cause of SAA, and many userorganizations have committed to it.andP;  So it is a safe bet that thisarchitecture will play a major role in IS shops in the 1990s.andM;What of other technologies that may help shape IS in the 1990s?andP;  Some believethat artificial intelligence will play an important role in the push forproductivity.andP;  But AI at this point may be less a user's tool to speeddevelopment and more a vendor's tool for value-added selling and maintenance.andM;&quot;When we sell some of our customers our product, we give them expert systemsto help them understand how to use it in the best, most economical, mosthigh-quality ways,&quot; says DuPont's Shultz.andP;  &quot;The expert system is shipped ondisk with certain DuPont products.andP;  It'll go right on your PC--load it up andit's right there for you.&quot;andM;Shultz also believes that executive information systems use will increase dueto connectivity demands and the desire of executives to manage theircompanies more globally.andP;  &quot;Because executives today have to deal more on aglobal basis than ever before, if they're going to be competitive, they'dbetter have at their fingertips their business activity in summary form orthey're not going to be able to keep up with competition,&quot; he says.andO;&quot;Executives have got toknow what their share is, what their market activityis, how they're competing in certain areas, what their product mix is andwhat is profitable and which isn't.&quot;andM;Distributed computing, long promised but never quite delivered, willaccompany the decentralization trend already under way in many corporations.andO;Says Tom Cato, vice president of the Informations Services Inc. subsidiary ofHospital Corp of America: &quot;We will continue to decentralize our computeroperation by further extending the role of computers inside the hospitaloperation, and each department will be further automated.andP;  Distributedprocessing is the way we're tackling our DP opportunities.andM;&quot;I was brought in because of my business background, not because I'm atechnical genius,&quot; Cato continues.andP;  &quot;We're working closer and closer withgroup operations, bringing technical solutions to business problems.andP;  Ourtechnicians design code, working closely with user reviewgroups--nontechnical people from hospital operations and corporateoperations, depending on the problem we're trying to solve.andP;  Those usergroups are defining the goals we're trying to hit.andP;  We think the benefit oftechnology is at the lowest level, so we're pushing it out.andP;  It's workingreally well.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
