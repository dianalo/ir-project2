Garcia</HL><DD> 12/05/86</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)STOCK INDEXES (NDX) </IN><TEXT>   Most stock-price indexes eased again yesterday as investors continued to take profits by selling recent big gainers, but there were notable exceptions.    Thrift, utility and some bank stocks moved higher. Transportation stocks kept chugging along, too, with the Dow Jones Transportation Average closing up 2.99 at 866.74, a record for the third consecutive day.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended off 7.59 at 1939.68, having never strayed far from Wednesday's closing level. Traders said buyers appeared whenever prices dropped during the day, but a wave of profit-taking pushed the average lower in the final hour.    As in Wednesday's session, the industrial average's decline was larger than that of some broader market measures. The Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index dropped only 0.81 to 253.04, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index lost 0.37 to 144.68. Volume, though still heavy, contracted to 156.9 million shares from 200.1 million Wednesday. Big Board decliners led advancers 839-713.    The over-the-counter market continued to rise. The Nasdaq OTC composite index gained 1.03 to 364.07 as volume contracted to 95.3 million shares from 134.4 million Wednesday. There were 873 issues advancing and 794 declining.    The bond market rally of recent sessions apparently has sharpened investor appetites for such interest-rate sensitive issues as bank, thrift, insurance and utility stocks. This group showed little spark earlier this fall, when the rest of the market was gradually advancing and many analysts were touting the prospects of stocks that should benefit from a more robust economy. But the rate-sensitive issues started to post major advances early this week.    Insurance stocks traded on the Big Board scored big gains in the first three days of the week but eased yesterday. Thrift issues, however, kept rolling along. Among the gainers, H.F. Ahmanson rose 3/4 to 23 5/8; Great Western Financial moved up 1 1/8 to 45 1/2; Golden West Financial gained 1 1/4 to 35 3/4; and Far West Financial added 3/8 to 13. Financial stocks also were big gainers in the OTC market again.    &quot;This just has to be a major plus for the stock market,&quot; said Ralph Bloch, senior technical analyst with Raymond James andamp; Associates in St. Petersburg, Fla. He said the charts for many of these stocks show &quot;legitimate accumulation since mid-September&quot; and their prices &quot;blasted through&quot; this week.    John Connolly, a market strategist at Dean Witter Reynolds in New York, says the strength in the bond market indicates a growing conviction among investors that the economy won't show signs of robust growth anytime soon, that interest rates will continue to decline and that inflation will remain under control.    The Commerce Department reinforced that conviction by reporting that October factory orders tumbled 3.6%, their steepest drop in more than six years.    Accordingly, Mr. Connolly said he is willing to take a bet on rate-sensitive and consumer-growth stocks, the same issues that led the market from the fall of 1985 through early this summer. &quot;I can just smell the money to be made in the old leadership,&quot; he said.    This week's rally in the rate-sensitive sector already has some market professionals rethinking their investment strategies. &quot;We're starting to call into question the cyclical play that has been very prevalent in the stock market in the last few months,&quot; one New York-based money manager said.    And in fact, cyclical stocks such as retailing and technology issues, which benefit from stronger economic growth and higher consumer and corporate spending, had setbacks yesterday.    J.C. Penney fell 3 3/8 to 80 3/4; F.W. Woolworth slid 1 5/8 to 43 7/8; May Department Stores fell 1 to 39; K mart lost 3/4 to 49 3/4; and Sears fell 1/4 to 44 3/8. Large general merchandisers, such as these companies, reported unexpectedly modest sales for November.    Thomas Tashjian, a retailing analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities, said that although the November retail sales figures were disappointing, he still expects retailers to be profitable in the fourth quarter. He said most retailers have their inventories under control and won't have to resort to major markdowns to move merchandise.    Computer issues generally sagged yesterday, with International Business Machines down 7/8 to 127 3/4, Unisys off 1/4 to 85 1/2 and Digital Equipment off 3/4 to 106 5/8. Cray Research rose 3 to 82, although there weren't any news announcements concerning the company.    Honeywell slid 2 1/4 to 66 3/4. The company said it sold its South African unit to a Johannesburg-based concern.    USG traded as low as 39 1/4 before recovering to close at 41 7/8, down 1 1/8. The company said late Wednesday that it bought the Belzberg brothers' 4.9% stake for $139.6 million. USG insisted it hadn't paid greenmail, but the Belzbergs walked away with a quick profit of at least $25 million.    Gillette surged 6 3/4 to 54 3/4 on volume of more than 3.1 million shares amid rumors that American Brands, rebuffed in its efforts to acquire Chesebrough-Pond's, is focusing on Gillette. Both American Brands and Gillette declined to comment. American Brands fell 3/4 to 45 3/8.    Diamond Shamrock gained 5/8 to 15 1/4 on more than two million shares. The Wall Street Journal said yesterday that the company might seek a friendly suitor or purchase a large block of its stock to thwart an unsolicited takeover offer from Mesa Limited Partnership.    Alan Gaines of Gaines Berland told Dow Jones News Service that Diamond Shamrock might be sold to a foreign buyer. He noted that the fall in the dollar over the past year and a half has helped make the company more attractive to foreign concerns.    Holiday closed up 3/4 at 70 after trading as high as 71 3/8. The company said its net income would fall after its proposed recapitalization because of increased interest expense. But it estimated that it will earn $60 million in 1987.    Coca-Cola rose 5/8 to 38 1/2. The company said it plans to buy back as many as 10 million common shares in the open market, beginning this month.    Recognition Equipment rose 1 1/2 to 15. The company's earnings in the fourth quarter ended Oct. 31 rose to 42 cents a share from eight cents a year earlier.    Schlumberger rose 5/8 to 34 1/8 in active trading. The stock was recommended by Shearson Lehman Brothers. </TEXT></DOC>
