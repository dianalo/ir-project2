Sihanouk, who leads a coalition fighting Vietnam's 10-yearoccupation of Cambodia, said in a statement that ``it is absolutelyuseless for me to be in Jakarta'' for next month's talks.   The prince also said he would not go to Paris for a meeting ofthe three resistance factions and the Vietnam-backed Phnom Penhgovernment next spring and called off a meeting in Bangkok with ThaiForeign Minister Siddhi Savetsila at the end of February.   Vietnam, Laos, the warring parties of Cambodia and the members ofthe non-communist Association of Southeast Asian Nations were tomeet in Jakarta from Feb. 19 to 22 for the second session ofmultilateral peace talks. The first meeting was held last July.   The association includes Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore,Malaysia, the Philippines and Brunei.   Sihanouk, who arrived in Beijing on Tuesday, said the recentrejection of his five-point peace plan for Cambodia sparked hisdecision.   A day earlier, the mercurial leader said he would go to Jakarta,but would not take part in the talks.   In his plan, Sihanouk proposed that an international peacekeepingforce supervise Vietnam's withdrawal.   Hun Sen, the Hanoi-backed prime minister of Cambodia, hasrejected the plan because he claims it would facilitate the returnto power in Cambodia of the Khmer Rouge, the most powerful of thethree resistance groups.   The Khmer Rouge led Cambodia from 1975 to late 1978 and wereresponsible for at least 1 million deaths during a bloody rule.Vietnam's invasion in Dec. 1978 replaced the pro-Beijing Khmer Rougewith a pro-Hanoi regime.   China attacked Vietnam in 1979 to ``punish'' it for the Cambodianinvasion. But in a sign of progress on the Cambodian issue, the twocountries last week held their first high-level meeting in a decade.   During the talks, Vietnam agreed in principle to withdraw itstroops from Cambodia by September, assuming a political solution canbe reached. Hanoi also agreed that an international group couldsupervise the withdrawal, but its makeup has yet to be determined.   China for its part agreed to slow its aid to the Cambodianresistance coalition as Vietnam withdraws its troops.   The agreement in principle does not represent a change inposition by either country. Both had issued public statements beforethe meeting spelling out their positions.   On Tuesday, Sihanouk said he opposed the linking of ``an end tomaterial aid to the resistance and the withdrawal of Vietnamesetroops.'' He also said he was pessimistic about an easy solution tothe conflict.   Sihanouk said progress has been made on solving the internationalaspects of the conflict, but a ``deadlock'' remains regarding themakeup of a future Cambodian government.   In Bangkok, Thai Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan today urgedall Cambodian guerrilla factions to attend the peace talks inIndonesia.   ``The Cambodian parties must face one another. It's pointless forthem to fight and kill one another,'' Chatichai told reporters aftertwo days of talks with Hun Sen.</TEXT></DOC>
