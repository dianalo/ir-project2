To the San Francisco law firm of Pettitandamp; Martin, it meant a bonanza.   Soon, regulators are expected to announce that they havesettled a lawsuit that Pettit filed on behalf of the U.S.government against former management of the Davis, Calif.,thrift. The estimated $50 million recovery is a respectablesum but only about half the damages originally sought. Forits part, Pettit andamp; Martin is collecting $10 million to $15million in fees and costs -- one of the most expensive suitsthrift regulators have ever filed.</LP><TEXT>   Like Pettit, a growing number of private law firms aremaking hay out of the taxpayer-funded bank and thriftbailouts. For years, the government has relied primarily onoutside firms for such work, on the theory that they provide&quot;the highest quality legal services possible in a timely,efficient and cost-effective manner,&quot; according to agovernment brochure.   But there is increasing evidence that the program is wellshort of its ideal. Last week, the inspector general of theFederal Deposit Insurance Corp. accused the agency's legaldivision of a variety of sins and suggested, withoutidentifying specific cases, that the division is wastingmillions of dollars through lax or misguided management.Certainly, a closer look at some individual cases points upconfusion and delay and an atmosphere in which lawyers, likethe savings and loan operators who caused the mess, have hada chance to run up costs at taxpayers' expense.   &quot;If you're dealing with a client with bottomless pocketsand less than total vigilance, then you are going to useevery strategem possible,&quot; asserts Theodore Jacobs, chiefcounsel of the Commerce, Consumer, and Monetary AffairsSubcommittee of the House Government Operations Committee,which is holding a hearing tomorrow about the issue.   The FDIC and its affiliated Resolution Trust Corp. areexpected to spend some $887 million on legal services thisyear, up from $733 million last year. Most goes to privatefirms: about $700 million this year, compared with $615million in 1990. The sums are bound to increase because thenumber of lawsuits involving the agencies continues to rise.Moreover, figures in the inspector general's report indicatethat the average amount the agency is spending on individualcases is also rising.   &quot;We are far from perfect,&quot; FDIC general counsel AlfredJ.T. Byrne says in an interview. Mr. Byrne, who joined theagency in June 1990, says he still is having trouble gettingan accurate count of the agencies' caseload. It is &quot;about100,000, as best as we can calculate,&quot; he says, up from lessthan 20,000 in 1988. The FDIC oversees bank suits and mattersinvolving the defunct Federal Savings and Loan InsuranceCorp., while the RTC tries to clean up post-1988 thriftinsolvencies.   The imperfections of the process were highlighted lastmonth, when the RTC paid $1.2 million to some creditors ofthe failed Victoria Savings Association of Texas. Thecreditors had won a lawsuit against the thrift before its1989 failure. The government hired the law firm of Haynes andamp;Boone to appeal. But the firm not only appealed the wrongcase, it filed its appeal the day after the filing deadlineexpired. The judgment was declared final and unappealable.   &quot;It was somebody's $1.2 million mistake,&quot; says CampCuthrell, a Corpus Christi, Texas, lawyer for the creditors.   In court papers, Haynes andamp; Boone and the RTC argued therewere other ways to attack the judgment, and that even if thejudgment were upheld, it was worthless because Victoria'sassets had been transferred to a new federally charteredinstitution. But a federal bankruptcy court overseeing theaffairs of the two creditors rejected the arguments. (An RTCspokeswoman says the case is &quot;under review&quot; and declinedfurther comment. Haynes andamp; Boone didn't return phone calls.)   Last year, the government won $68 million in a suitarising from the failure of Eureka Savings andamp; Loan Associationof San Carlos, Calif. That was the good news. The bad news:Regulators and their outside counsel, the San Francisco firmof Jackson Tufts Cole andamp; Black, had turned down $78 million.   The regulators and their lawyers had spurned the earlieroffer because they thought they could win hundreds ofmillions going to trial. But U.S. Judge Marilyn Patel hadstrongly urged the government to take the money and run andaccused the FDIC of &quot;playing Russian roulette with taxpayerdollars.&quot; She was prophetic: The case was settled for thelower amount before the defense put on a single witness.Jackson Tufts says it was &quot;an extraordinary result and one weare very proud of having achieved.&quot;   Defense lawyers naturally play a role in pushing up thecosts of such cases. In the Farmers Savings case, the 13 lawfirms for the defense racked up fees of an estimated $25million, putting even Pettit to shame.   But Pettit, which was first hired to investigate Farmerssix years ago, also made a federal case out of it. When theformer chief executive of the dead thrift, for instance, washimself murdered, a judge ordered Pettit to give the defensesome notes from an old interview it had conducted with theman. But Pettit challenged the order for more than 18 months,including two unsuccessful trips to a federal appeals court.   The FDIC says that Pettit's actions regarding theinterview were &quot;reasonable&quot; and that the cost of the multipleappeals was &quot;not great.&quot;   Pettit also spent months fighting defense requests seekingaccess to Farmers documents. The defense had a motion tocharge the government for costs of the delays beforesettlement talks heated up last summer. The FDIC says it&quot;should have prevailed&quot; had the issue been heard. It saysfurther that the pending settlement was &quot;proportional to thesize and complexity of the case.&quot; Pettit andamp; Martin says: &quot;Weprosecuted the case aggressively, and we believe that thisled directly to the very successful outcome.&quot;   Mr. Byrne, meanwhile, says the agency is serious aboutreducing costs. He says a beefed-up auditing section isoverseeing the 1,600 or so law firms that are expected toreceive fees from the FDIC and RTC this year. According toMr. Byrne, the auditors are finding overstaffing,unauthorized research and inflated clerical expenses and aregetting law firms to make refunds of an average 3% of feespreviously paid.   The Houston law firm of Andrews andamp; Kurth acknowledges thatit is in a &quot;five-figure&quot; tiff with the government over somepast charges. Mr. Byrne says a Florida law firm has agreed toreturn $180,000 but declines to name it. Such scrutiny isleaving many lawyers chagrined.   Richard Fruin, a Los Angeles lawyer who has done thriftwork for years, is among those whose bills are under attack.The FDIC challenged a few hours he spent revising a courtfiling he had prepared, he says, adding: &quot;I felt like saying,`Don't you think Hemingway ever revises?'&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
