And the changes make companies more sensitiveto interest rates than before.   Where firms once tended to draw down financial assets tofund capital investments, the growth in both availability andliquidity of financial instruments meant that financialassets and capital investments grew together, step-by-step,in the past half-decade, the report said.</LP><TEXT>   Also, &quot;interest rates may have more channels through whichto influence fixed investment, for interest rate changes areincreasingly reflected in returns on financial investment andthose returns are becoming a meaningful yardstick foropportunity cost of capital expenditure,&quot; the study said.   The authors note that returns on financial assets nowfluctuate more closely with changes in rates than before themid-1980s. And, as profitability on short-term assets hasincreased, fund managers have become more keen on activelyhandling portfolios to reflect returns and risks.</TEXT></DOC>
