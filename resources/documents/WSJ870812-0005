In the year-earlier quarter, the energy concern earned $221.3 million, or $5.99 a share. Revenue rose 15% to $887.9 million from $757.1 million.    The 1986 quarter included profit from operations of $201.2 million and a loss from discontinued operations of $5.8 million. In addition, the year-earlier quarter included a gain of $232 million from the sale of bonds, as well as an extraordinary item totaling $25.7 million from the effects of accounting changes. McDermott said that minus the affects of the gain and extraordinary item, it would have posted a loss of about $35 million in the 1986 quarter.    J.E. Cunningham, McDermott's chairman and chief executive officer, said the company sees a recent stabilization of energy prices as a forerunner to eventual improvements in all segments of its businesses. &quot;Market conditions appear to be improving and, in our opinion, opportunities will soon begin to emerge in various segments of our world-wide operations.&quot;    Mr. Cunningham added that until the improvements occur, the company will continue to increase productivity and efficiency through automation and to reduce costs through consolidation. He said, however, that most of the company's businesses &quot;lag changes in the energy market by a year or so, and therefore we do not believe that these positive factors will have an effect on our marine operations this year.&quot;    Separately, representatives of the United Steelworkers union asked the company to give employees of its troubled tubular-goods plant in Beaver Falls, Pa., the opportunity to buy the operation. The company had said in June that it plans to discontinue operations at the plant, but said it would be interested in talking to the union's investment bankers.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, McDermott shares fell $1.25 to close yesterday at $30.25. </TEXT></DOC>
