<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-13-0490 </DOCNO><TEXT>In this paper, the authors elaborate on three major enhancements to theconventional object-oriented data model, namely, schema evolution, compositeobjects, and versions. Schema evolution is the ability to dynamicallymake changes to the class definitions and the structure of the classlattice. Composite objects are recursive collections of exclusive componentsthat are treated as units of storage, retrieval, and integrity enforcement.Versions are variations of the same object that are related by the historyof their derivation. These additional features are strongly motivatedby data management requirements of object-oriented applications fromthe AI, CAD/CAM, and OIS (office information systems with multimediadocuments) domains. An object-oriented data model, with these enhancements,has been incorporated into ORION, a prototype database system developedat MCC as a vehicle of research into object-oriented databases.</TEXT></DOC>
