In a speech on Friday in Prague, Czechoslovakia, Mr. Gorbachev for the first time accepted the concept of simultaneous, but separate, talks on short-range nuclear systems in Europe while an agreement on intermediate forces is being negotiated.    Mr. Shultz's three days of Moscow meetings, the most important East-West talks since last October's summit in Reykjavik, Iceland, are meant to achieve sufficient progress toward an agreement on abolishing intermediate nuclear forces in Europe to open the way for a U.S. summit in the late summer or early autumn when, if all goes as planned, the Reagan administraton's first arms-control agreement would be signed.    The unusually large staff traveling with Mr. Shultz scoured Mr. Gorbachev's text while preparing final negotiating positions in Helsinki yesterday before their arrival in Moscow today.    Mr. Gorbachev's statement Friday was an apparent attempt to reassure the U.S. and Europe on the issue of short-range nuclear weapons. But the U.S. has wanted to link talks on short-range weapons to talks on intermediate forces, and Mr. Gorbachev said in his speech that &quot;the course or result&quot; of the short-range talks shouldn't be linked to intermediate talks. The Soviets also hold that no new short-range systems should be deployed during such talks.    Also on Friday, President Reagan said a &quot;breakthrough&quot; in these negotiations on short-range missiles &quot;is now a distinct possibility.&quot;    White House officials traveling with President Reagan, who is vacationing at his ranch in Santa Barbara, Calif., said that Mr. Shultz is carrying a letter to Mr. Gorbachev from the president. Officials confirmed that the letter deals with arms control, but they declined to be more specific.    Unlike Reykjavik, where the U.S. wasn't prepared for Soviet surprise offers, this time officials say Mr. Shultz has been fully briefed about &quot;the trapdoors that might be opened.&quot; They say he will be particularly wary of any offer on short-range missiles that would reduce numbers to below a level the U.S. considers necessary to credibly offset Soviet conventional superiority -- a fear expressed to him recently by European allies.    &quot;There is a level of nuclear weaponry . . . that we and our allies will want to hold onto because that is an important part of what it takes to preserve peace,&quot; Mr. Shultz said at a weekend news conference.    Instead of negotiating any surprise offers on the spot, U.S. officials say they will withhold full response until they meet with allies. &quot;We are going to let Shultz be Shultz,&quot; one official said, referring to Mr. Shultz's conservative and calm manner.    Even though President Reagan on Friday welcomed Mr. Gorbachev's suggestion to accelerate talks on short-range nuclear weapons, the Soviet offer leaves many problems. U.S. officials insist that an agreement on intermediate weapons fix a ceiling on short-range systems and give the U.S. the right to build to Soviet levels. Officials say that to do otherwise would take away Soviet incentive to reduce the short-range weapons and &quot;would fix an extreme imbalance&quot; in these weapons, said Assistant Secretary of State Rozanne Ridgway.    Mr. Gorbachev, in an apparent bid to address West European concerns that an intermediate pact would make them more vulnerable to Soviet weapons, also proposed that foreign ministers of 35 nations participating in the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe meet in Vienna, Austria, to agree on talks to &quot;radically reduce the numbers of tactical nuclear weapons, armed forces and conventional armaments.&quot;    Mr. Shultz rejected that idea, a proposal U.S. officials say is aimed at reducing U.S. influence on talks, as well as heightening the chances of Western disunity.    Mr. Gorbachev's proposal also didn't address a U.S. desire to convince the Soviets to give up their insistence on preserving 100 intermediate warheads in Asia, which has raised complaints in Japan that Washington is sending a signal to Moscow that it cares more about European security than Asian security. The intermediate agreement, as currently framed also would allow Washington to keep 100 warheads in the U.S.    Chemical weapons are seen as another area in which Mr. Gorbachev's speech has set the table for a public relations coup because of public failure to understand the virtual impossibility of adequate verification, one official said. Mr. Gorbachev announced in Prague that Moscow hopes for an international convention this year on chemical weapons and that Moscow had stopped producing them.    Mr. Shultz's Moscow talks will be carried out under unusual constraints for members of the delegation due to doubts regarding embassy security in the wake of the Marine spy scandal. The U.S. has flown in a special car and a secure van that will be placed on embassy grounds. Mr. Shultz is scheduled to leave Moscow Wednesday and fly to Brussels, Belgium, where he will brief U.S. allies about the talks. </TEXT></DOC>
