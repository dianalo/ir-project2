The rescheduling involves $2.1 billion of debt payments falling due between Jan. 1, 1986, and June 30, 1988, Mario Brodersohn, Argentina's Treasury secretary, said. That covers 100% of the principal and interest payments owed government creditors in that period, he added. Argentina will make its first payment on the debt in 1993 and the rest in the four following years.    The Paris Club is an informal group of creditor nations that meets to act on requests from nations for debt reschedulings.    Mr. Brodersohn called the Paris Club rescheduling the final stage in the country's efforts to renegotiate the terms of its external debt, which currently totals about $50 billion.    Earlier this week, the Argentine delegation met in Paris with representatives from creditor banks in France, Britain, the Netherlands and other nations. As previously reported, Argentina and its major bank creditors last month completed negotiations on a proposed debt rescheduling and new loan agreement.    That proposal, which was sent to Argentina's 350 creditor banks for approval, includes a new medium-term loan of $1.55 billion, a new trade-credit and deposit facility totaling $400 million, a rescheduling of about $30 billion of debt and two other trade-credit and money-market deposit facilities.    It also includes a debt-for-equity swap program and other innovations, several of which are meant to quicken the gathering of the $1.55 billion new loan. Argentina's creditor banks are being asked to commit themselves to the agreement by June 17.    In February, Argentina won approval in principle for $1.9 billion in loans from the International Monetary Fund, but the credits had hinged on completing the just-finished negotiations with commercial banks. The IMF agreement also stipulated that Argentina should continue its economic restructuring, which most analysts believe has been working relatively well. And in January, the World Bank agreed to lend Argentina another $2 billion during the next two years.    Mr. Brodersohn said yesterday that because of the grace periods in the commercial bank agreement and Paris Club accord, Argentina will have a four-year breathing space in which to turn around its economy before it once again feels the full impact of its debt burden.    He emphasized that Argentina, as well as other heavily indebted Latin American nations, will surmount their debt problems only when growth quickens in the creditor nations, generating stepped-up trade. </TEXT></DOC>
