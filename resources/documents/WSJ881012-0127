The businessman standing next to me has balanced a ledger right on top of the cockles and mussels, all cooked and arrayed in an open-air stall. We're a few crucial steps from the traffic grinding through the Cambridge Circus in central London. But here it is quiet enough for my neighbor to tally columns of figures and for me to ask the man who runs the stall where he gets the basic ingredient for London's most folkloric dish, jellied eels. Ireland, he says, and they're tenderer, not so rubbery as the Japanese eels he gets when the Irish season's over.    Jellied eel sounds forbidding and looks it, too. Bits of cold poached eel in a gray aspic. But it's really easy to love -- mild, unfishy fish flesh in a delicate jelly.    Habitues like to jazz it up with vinegar. The stall provides big brown bottles labeled &quot;condiment&quot; because the Common Market, bowing to French chauvinism, won't allow the name vinegar, derived from the French &quot;vinaigre&quot; (originally &quot;vin aigre&quot; or sour wine) to be applied to a British product. Whatever you call it, it gives you a thirst.    That would have been a problem at 3 p.m. any year between 1915 and this summer, because the pubs would have been closed. Parliament ended all that this August. And now, pubs can stay open all afternoon.    If nothing else, the new law simplifies life for foreigners. Instead of the mystifying patchwork of hours meant to keep munitions workers on the job during World War I, one now need only remember that bars open at 11 a.m. and close 12 hours later at 11 p.m. This liberated schedule will still cramp the style of New York topers accustomed to legal service from dawn until 4 a.m., but at least it's easy to remember. Then again, this is England, and nothing is simple. Tradition still reigns in untold thousands of the country's 71,000 pubs that are not opting to change their ways. These places bang closed after lunch and reopen at 5. They are the conservative reaction in the latest social conflict to rock this disputatious isle.    The old rules were compulsory. If you wanted to run a pub, you had to stay open when the law said you could, and you had to close when it said to close. As the fatal moment approached twice a day, barkeeps gently chivied customers to finish and leave. &quot;Hurry up, please. It's time&quot; was a line so often heard in British life that T.S. Eliot could slip it into &quot;The Waste Land&quot; along with unattributed lines of poetry from classic authors of the past. And if thousands of publicans have their way, Britons will continue to hear those words twice a day.    The reason is simple. Publicans aren't eager to work in the afternoon, especially when the breweries that own many of the pubs haven't rushed to raise wages for the two-and-a-half hours a day of extra bar duty. Small wonder, when early sales figures show no appreciable increase in overall turnover.    Not all customers have sympathized with the publicans' plight. Take the regulars at the Farmers' Arms in Clubmoor, Liverpool. They staged a sit-in, refusing to leave when the landlady, Eileen Evans, tried to close at 3 p.m.. She was one of many members of the National Association of Licensed House Managers who were refusing to permit &quot;all-day drinking.&quot; Her employer, Bass Charrington, the brewers, wouldn't give her a raise. But her customers weren't mollified. Some 50 of them stayed put between 3 p.m. and 5 p.m. Some of them pushed Ms. Evans to the floor when she called time -- and sat on her.    Here in the home of soccer violence, perhaps none of this is surprising. Pubs, moreover, like bars anywhere, are likely places for drunken brawling to break out. Lately, however, there appears to have been a trend in the London region for drunks to take on the police. One paper last March showed a policeman named John Gildersleeve with a bent screwdriver stuck in his head near his ear. He was stabbed while trying to break up a fight in a pub in Eton, home of England's poshest boarding school.    Ms. Evans of the Farmers' Arms seems, in fact, to have got off easy. According to Matthew Gwyther's article last month in the Independent Magazine, the Licensed Victuallers' Association &quot;gets a dozen claims each month from its publican members seriously injured or disfigured in attacks by customers.&quot; The association represents only a third of the publicans in England and Wales.    Into this breach has stepped Tony Hornsby, an unexpected example of Thatcherite entrepreneurial spirit. A former Royal Army dog trainer, he now runs a training camp for pub guard dogs in the Norfolk village of Methwold. There, Mr. Hornsby breeds Rottweilers and German shepherds and trains them to protect publicans. Mr. Hornsby boasted that one of his graduates, surprised while snoozing by a would-be thief in the saloon bar of a Lewisham pub, lunged at the intruder, &quot;ripped him and threw him down the cellar.&quot; Mr. Hornsby is refining his methods, building a full-scale pub interior in his back yard with tables, glasses and a slot machine.    Happy days. </TEXT></DOC>
