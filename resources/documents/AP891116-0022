It's part of deregulation. But Mr.Smith is very sincere about it. I see nothing wrong with having thehearing.''   The bill, introduced by Rep. Peter Smith, R-Vt., would create avoluntary program allowing local schools more flexibility in theuse of federal education dollars in exchange for improving studentperformance. Participation in the program would be canceled ifstudent achievements worsen within two years.   Among the scheduled witnesses are New Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean;Albert Shanker, president of the American Federation of Teachers;and Stephanie Robinson of the National Urban League.   Hawkins contends that a bill signed into law last year addressesmany of the concerns raised in Smith's bill.   ``Trying new ideas when we already have success seems to be afoolish waste of money,'' he said.   Hawkins also complained that President Bush and the nation'sgovernors failed to specify at a September education summit thefederal regulations that are the most frustrating for educators.   ``To some extent I'm for simplification of regulations,'' hesaid. ``I would hope that this hearing will help ... find out whatthey're talking about. The president made a commitment to thegovernors that he would sponsor deregulation. Well, obviously theywant to get money with no strings attached. But that doesn't meanit's good for children.''   Smith, an educator and former Vermont lieutenant governor,introduced the bill days before the historic education summit thatconcluded with an agreement that national performance goals wouldbe developed and federal regulations tied to key education programswould be loosened.   In a joint statement, Bush and the governors said, ``we want toswap red tape for results.''   Smith said the summit gave his bill the impetus it needed.   ``It's a difference between night and day,'' Smith said in aninterview Wednesday. ``The idea of restructuring is something thata number of us has been working on for five to six years. It'sbipartisan, but mostly at the gubernatorial and state commissionlevel. (The summit) propelled the idea onto the national agenda.''   The bill specifies that the civil rights of students cannot beinfringed in exercising local flexibility with federal dollars _ aprovision Smith said ensures that programs for disadvantagedstudents won't be shortchanged.   Smith said he had gotten positive reaction from many members ofCongress, although the National Education Association is ``moreguarded'' and the National Urban League insists it ``doesn't go farenough.''   ``It's a big change,'' he said. ``We're talking about a majorconcept on how we relate to schools. It ought to be controversial.People ought to care deeply about it and ask tough questions aboutit.''</TEXT></DOC>
