This process can concentratethe activity into a small volume of solid waste which may be either transformedinto a stable solid or incorporated into a solid matrix. The fixatorsare radiation resistant; most of them do not suffer chemical degradationin a large scale of pH. They can exhibit a high selectivity for certainions. Inorganic fixators, especially insoluble ferrocyanides, seem tobe promising for cesium decontamination. Polyantimonic acid is knownfor its good efficiency towards the fixation of strontium, but with aslow kinetics. We have studied two types of products: insoluble ferrocyanidesand antimonic or phosphatoantimonic acids. Owing to the support of ouranterior studies and the proposal of a new preparation process whichcontrols the particle size and produces ferrocyanides suitable for useon columns, this work was devoted to the determination of the optimalrecovery conditions of radioactive cesium and silver on several typesof nickel and zinc ferrocyanides. The other purpose of our study wasa comparison between antimonic acid and some new phosphatoantimonic acidsin order to select the most efficient compound for the fixation of strontium.The fixation of lanthanum was also studied as a model for transuranicelements.</TEXT></DOC>
