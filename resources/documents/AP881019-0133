(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   PTL founder Jim Bakker said today thateverything he did before leaving the television ministry in scandalwas for the good of the church and he did not misuse ministry funds.   ``We believe in our faith that the church is the center ofsociety,'' Bakker told U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds.``Everything we did came under the umbrella of the church. Therewas no profit in anything we did.''   Upon questioning by his attorney, Ryan Hovis, Bakker tried tojustify commercial entities such as a water park and variouslodging facilities and stores at the Heritage USA Christian retreat.   ``It was, at least when I was there, a Christian center, a placewhere people of like faith could come together, to sing and praiseGod in the streets if they wanted to and not have to fear insult.   ``Just because we're born again doesn't mean we don't needdrugstores, toothpaste and other needs. Why should those visitingthe church have to go elsewhere to have those needs met?'' Bakkersaid.   ``None of the stores, none of that activity was there for profitfor us.''   Bakker testified as he and his attorneys began their defensetoday in the bankruptcy trial against the PTL founder. PTL'scurrent leadership is seeking $52 million that it says was misspentor mismanaged during the Bakker era.   At one point Reynolds interrupted, pushing Hovis to get to thepoint of ``what happened to the money.''   ``I think you need to get into the dollars and cents. I thinkeverybody agrees it was a wonderful idea, but the question is didhe (Bakker) overdo it,'' Reynolds said.   Bakker was scheduled to continue his testimony later today inthe trial, which resumed Monday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court after amonth recess. Bakker had briefly testified in the case last month.   Also testifying for the defense this morning was an auditor whosaid he found the television ministry in sound financial shape whenBakker left it in 1987 amid a sex and money scandal.   His attorneys questioned Allen Andrews, director of corporatefinances for Lockheed Corp., who did an audit of financialstatements and records of the television ministry and Heritage USAtheme park, documents dating from the last few years Bakker headedthe ministry.   ``The statements that I reviewed didn't indicate any negativesituations,'' Andrews said. ``We found the corporation seemed to besolvent, had good assets and revenues that seemed to be growing.''   The audit was conducted over the past several weeks, Hovis said.   Andrews said PTL ``generally looked like it was in soundcondition.''   He also testified that the considerable travel expenditures andcash advances, such as those received by Bakker before hisresignation in March 1987, were normal procedure for the chiefexecutive of a corporation.   On Tuesday, Bakker said documents he had just received shouldvindicate him against charges he failed to repay the televisionministry money he used for his own benefit.   He told reporters he was ``a touch angry'' he was only nowreceiving canceled checks and reimbursement receipts and hintedthey may have been purposely withheld.   ``I think somebody calculated they would hold all the materialsuntil the middle of the trial,'' he said, though he did not saywho. The former television evangelist predicted his research wouldsatisfy at least 90 percent of the Internal Revenue Service'sconcerns.   In its suit against Bakker, his wife, Tammy, and former aideDavid Taggart, PTL accuses Bakker of mismanaging the ministry. Theministry presented testimony in the first week of the trial inSeptember that the Bakkers received about $9.5 million in bonuses,salaries and other compensationfrom 1983 to 1987.   An IRS agent also testified he found cash advances to Bakker andTaggart that apparently served no legitimate business purpose.   The ministry entered bankruptcy protection three months afterBakker left in March 1987 after he admitted to a sexual encounterwith former church secretary Jessica Hahn.   Bakker called the suit ``a trial for my life.''   ``It may be business as usual for everyone else, but this is mylife I'm talking about,'' he said during a lunch break in thehearing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court.   Bakker attorney Jim Toms said his client's comments aboutpossible sabotage ``really reflect a frustration'' in trying toprove his case based on records scattered among PTL offices, afederal grand jury probe, and bankruptcy court. A federal grandjury in Charlotte, N.C., has been investigating for more than ayear whether the ministry raised money for one purpose and used itfor another.   In Tuesday's testimony, an independent financial analyst, JamesWilson, said PTL's finances from 1978 to 1986 showed it to be ahealthy, growing ministry without financial problems.   Also Tuesday, a former PTL board member said Bakker deservedevery bonus he received while at the helm of the Fort Mill-basedtelevision ministry and religious theme park.   Evelyn Spencer told Reynolds she and other board membersconsistently voted unanimously in favor of bonuses for Bakker.   During the first half of the trial, PTL attorneys White and BradLeggett presented financial records and testimony from PTLofficials and an IRS agent that PTL claimed showed Bakker hadmismanaged the ministry.</TEXT></DOC>
