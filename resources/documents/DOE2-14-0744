<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-14-0744 </DOCNO><TEXT>A theory of ultracold neutron (UCN) heating for a case of impurity hydrogenscattering is presented in brief. In comparison of the theory and thelatest experiments only those are chosen that are decisive in confirmationof the hypothesis on defining role of hydrogen in UCN heating, UCN inelasticscattering on the wall surface is considered. Theoretical estimationof UCN loss coefficient is carried out. A direct confirmation of hypothesison decisive role of hydrogen (hydrogen contamination of the walls ofcontaining vessels) in UCN heating is obtained.</TEXT></DOC>
