<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-81-1041 </DOCNO><TEXT>Describes surveying procedures for small and slow ground subsidence occurringover a vast area due to surface mine drainage. Such subsidence rangesbetween 0 and over 25 mm per year and, in 1985, affected, as an example,over 100 km{sup 2} of the Belchatow brown coal surface mining area. Inorder to assess subsidence of the land surface in the vicinity of mines,the established survey network is measured in 1 to 4 year time periods.Design of survey networks (stretching over 1,400 km{sup 2} at the Belchatowmine), level measurements, interpretation of measurements and accuracycalculations are explained. The 'George 3' program system is appliedat the Wroclaw Technical University for determining level networks andsubsidence. Results are used for forecasting the progress of subsidenceand assessing damage and hazards to surface structures. 4 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
