Tisch, earned almost $1.2 million in salary and bonuses in 1987, but in some ways CBS Records President Walter Yetnikoff fared even better.    CBS's new proxy statement shows its four top officers each were paid $700,000 or more last year. A fifth earned nearly $500,000. Among them: Mr. Tisch, who also runs Loews Corp., which owns 24.9% of CBS, was paid $726,923 in salary plus a $453,750 bonus. CBS, which has been strained by cost-cutting and network losses, also paid Loews $262,540 to cover Mr. Tisch's four-month stint as acting chief before he took over last January. The president of the CBS Broadcast Group, Gene F. Jankowski, earned $800,700 in salary and bonuses, plus almost $200,000 in other cash compensation. William S. Paley, CBS chairman and founder, earned $700,000 in cash payments.    But Mr. Yetnikoff, who clashed often with Mr. Tisch before leaving CBS to continue running CBS Records upon its sale to Sony Corp. last January, also fared well. He received $975,266 in salary and bonuses and about $23,000 in other cash compensation in 1987 -- plus $838,268 last January in connection with the CBS Records sale. In return, Mr. Yetnikoff paid back $250,000 of a $1.25 million interest-free loan made to him by CBS -- and CBS forgave him the $659,656 unpaid balance of the note. </TEXT></DOC>
