The Association of Professional Flight Attendants said such a &quot;short-term solidarity strike&quot; would disrupt American's schedule, but wouldn't allow the Fort Worth, Texas-based AMR Corp. unit enough time to replace striking workers.    American denied that, saying it has &quot;developed a contingency plan and is totally confident that we can immediately replace any and all striking workers.&quot; It said a strike wouldn't interrupt service.    The union said it is prepared to call a series of short-term strikes at peak travel times if it can't reach agreement on a new contract.    The union plans to ask its members this month for the authority to call a strike, reversing its no-strike stance after more than a year of contract negotiations. The union charges American hasn't negotiated in good faith since unilaterally imposing a new contract June 1.    Union president Patt A. Gibbs said the union likely will go on strike between Dec. 20, when the ballots will be counted, and year end. American has maintained a strike would be illegal.    Separately, the company said it had filed for authority to serve Berlin with nonstop flights from there to five cities in West Germany and two other European cities.    If American wins approval for the routes, it would mark its most ambitious European expansion to date. It currently offers service to eight cities in Europe.    The service must be approved by the governments of each of the European countries as well as a tripartite body of representatives of the U.S., Britain and France.    American said it plans to service Frankfurt, Hamburg, Munich, Dusseldorf and Cologne, as well as Vienna, Austria, and Zurich, Switzerland, with a total of 33 round-trip flights each business day from Berlin's Tegel Airport.    American said it is seeking approval to begin the service on or about May 1, 1988. It also said it will add service to Berlin from the U.S., via Frankfurt. </TEXT></DOC>
