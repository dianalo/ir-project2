The deal is the latest in a series of such links, as big phonecustomers turn over the construction of state-of-the-artinternational networks to the big phone companies.   General Electric Co. said last week it had selected AmericanTelephone andamp; Telegraph Co., British Telecom and France Telecom tobuild the first phase of its international network. The value ofthat deal was not disclosed.   Merrill Lynch said it expects to reduce its costs by more than$100 million over the five-year period.   ``After an intensive review of our communications strategy andfuture needs, we chose MCI because of its ability to meet thetechnical and management demands of our business environment, theflexibility and responsiveness of its people, and its commitment tothe next generation of communications technology,'' WilliamSchreyer, Merrill's chairman and chief executive, said in astatement.   ``Together we are stepping into the future of informationmanagement,'' Bert C. Roberts Jr., MCI's president and chiefoperating officer, said in the statement.   MCI will use private lines to connect the firm's New York andNew Jersey headquarters with its 500 domestic branch offices andwith offices in Tokyo, London, Singapore, Toronto, Sidney,Australia and Berne, Switzerland. Switches in those foreign officeswill serve as gateways for calls to and from other points.   The system will be built around Merrill Lynch's existingbackbone of private lines.   The choice of MCI culminates a process that began last Septemberwhen MCI asked for proposals from the three main long-distancecompanies, MCI, ATandamp;T and US Sprint Communications Co.</TEXT></DOC>
