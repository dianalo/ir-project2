The total number comes to 31.2 million.    But by the year 2000, sinusitis could be in third place, overtaken by the current No. 2 and No. 3 chronic conditions -- arthritis, now with 30.3 million sufferers, and high blood pressure, with 28.6 million.    The reason for the turnabout: an expected 15-million-person increase in the population aged 45 to 64 by the end of the century.    Currently, the incidence rates for arthritis jump from 52 cases for every 1,000 persons aged 18 to 44, to 279 cases per 1,000 persons aged 45 to 64. Similarly, the incidence of high blood pressure increases from 62 cases for every 1,000 persons aged 18 to 44, to 265 cases per 1,000 persons aged 45 to 64.    Thus, 12 years from now, the predicted influx of 45-to-64 year olds will probably result in 3.4 million more people with arthritis, for a total of 33.7 million, and three million more people with high blood pressure, for a total of 31.6 million.    The incidence of sinusitis, on the other hand, doesn't seem to increase as people age. So, by 2000, the number of sinusitis sufferers probably won't have grown by any significant amount.    ---                        Health Woes    Top three chronic health problems, by age of sufferer                 (Rate per 1,000 persons)                                     18-44       45-64    Sinusitis                          160        181    Arthritis                           52        279    High Blood Pressure                 62        265   ---   Winners and Losers   In Migration Trends   BETWEEN 1980 and 1987, 25 U.S. states gained residents through people moving in from other states or from abroad, for a net gain of eight million people. The other 25 states, meanwhile, had a net loss of 3.1 million people.   Most of the states with a net gain were in the South and the West. California took in 2.2 million new residents, Florida two million and Texas 1.3 million. Georgia and Arizona each gained about 400,000 people, while Virginia and North Carolina each netted about 275,000 new residents.   One-third of the total U.S. population resides in those seven states. Even so, they accounted for about two-thirds of all U.S. population growth between 1980 and 1987, primarily because of their high in-migration figures.   The states with the largest net migration losses were Michigan, down 503,000 residents; Ohio, down 478,000; and Illinois, down 420,000. New York, which lost more migrants than any other state during the 1970s (1.8 million people in all), has lost 324,000 more residents since 1980.   U.S. Households Keep   Declining in Size   THE AVERAGE SIZE of the U.S. household is still shrinking. In 1987, it had 2.66 members, down from about 2.76 in 1980, according to the latest Census Bureau survey.   The decline since 1980 is due partly to an 18% increase in the number of households headed by people age 65 and older. These households are considerably smaller than the norm, averaging only 1.76 members.   But households consisting of married couples with no children also are contributing to the decline. They have only 2.44 members on average and increased in number by 11.3% during the seven-year period.   Meanwhile, many of the larger households showed only small increases in numbers -- and some even declined. For example, households made up of married couples with children have fallen in number by 1.3% since 1980. Their average size: 4.1 members. At the same time, households headed by people age 45 to 54, with an average size of 3.10 members each, grew in number by only 5%.   The overall size of today's households masks significant variations by ethnic origin. Consider Hispanic households. They are substantially larger than the national average, with an average size of 3.42 members.   The reason for the size of the Hispanic household turns primarily on the demographic axiom that the younger the household head, the larger the household: Nearly 65% of all Hispanic households are headed by someone under age 45. The national average is 50%.   Lunch Time Is Not   The Only Shopping Time   THIRTY-EIGHT percent of office workers surveyed in and around eight U.S. cities said they go shopping during the work day, according to a study commissioned by the International Council of Shopping Centers. The metropolitan areas included in the study were Seattle, Dallas, San Francisco, Denver, Chicago, Atlanta, Tampa and Boston.   Still, not all of the shopping trips in those areas take place during the lunch hour. In fact, 40% of them occur at other times -- something of a surprise to those in the shopping-center business. &quot;The high proportion of nonlunch shopping trips reported in the survey contradicts the conventional wisdom that officeworker retail spending is confined to the lunch hour,&quot; report the study researchers.   Upper-level managers are the most likely to shop during nonlunch time hours. According to the researchers, that's apparently because only those people have the &quot;flexibility&quot; to leave their offices at odd hours.</TEXT></DOC>
