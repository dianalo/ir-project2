The Labor Department reported that wholesale prices rose 0.5percent last month, the biggest gain since March. Price increaseswere widespread across a wide variety of non-food items, such asdrugs, which were up 1.1 percent and cosmetics, up 1.7 percent.   In June, the department's Producer Price Index for finised goodsrose 0.4 percent, or at an annual rate of 4.6 percent, more thandouble the 2.2 percent rate of wholesale price inflation for all of1987.   Today's report comes just three days after the Federal Reserveinitiated an increase in interest rates to fight inflation.   On Thursday, major U.S. banks reacted quickly to the Fed's moveby boosting the prime lending rate a half percentage point to 10percent, the highest level since the spring of 1985.   The prime rate hike, though, didn't upset the financial marketsbecause it was a widely expected response to the Fed's earlieraction, in which the central bank raised the discount rate half apercentage point to 6.5 percent.   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose5.16 Thursday to 2,039.30. The average had had fallen nearly 100points over the five previous sessions, partly because ofinterest-rate jitters.   The dollar lost ground against all key foreign currencies,indicating that the boost in the prime rate was not seen as apowerful lure for foreign money.   The dollar's weakness in turn hurt bond prices, which finishedmostly unchanged or lower.   Because the prime is used to calculate a wide range of fixed-andadjustable-rate loans, the increase is likely to pinch thepocketbooks of consumers who already have seen borrowing costs risein recent months.   ``It will slow the economy, but it won't stop it in itstracks,'' explained Robert A. Brusca, chief financial economist forthe investment firm Nikko Securities Co. International. ``That's ahealthy thing right now.   ``You try to get your flu shot before you get the flu ... That'spreventative medicine. That's what the Fed is doing.''   The increase brings the closely watched rate to its highestlevel since June 18, 1985, when it was lowered to 9.5 percent from10 percent.   At the start of the year, the prime stood at 8.5 percent. It wasraised to 9 percent on May 11 and then another half percentagepoint on July 14.   The trend toward higher interest rates reflects prevailingconcerns in the credit markets that the economy might beoverheating and inflation creeping up.   In indicator of economic activity, the Commerce Departmentreported that retail sales climbed 0.5 percent in July. Buteconomists warned that rising interest rates threaten to dampeneven this modest growth rate in the months ahead.</TEXT></DOC>
