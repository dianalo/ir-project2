After several years of moderate increases, insurance ratesto cover workplace injuries are expected to skyrocket in 1992as medical costs climb, litigation increases and more peopleput in claims for stress and unusual syndromes.</LP><TEXT>   The National Council on Compensation Insurance, anadvisory rating agency for insurers in most states, plans torecommend rate increases nationally averaging 15%.Consequently, small-business owners and large companies inmany states are bracing for hefty double-digit increases nextyear.   But while big corporations often have greater financialresources to absorb the shock of higher costs -- and oftencan negotiate more favorable rates with insurers -- smallcompanies seldom enjoy such luxuries. And because ratechanges vary from state to state, entrepreneurs in one statemight suddenly find themselves at a disadvantage withcompetitors in neighboring states, to say nothing of foreigncompetitors.   Consider the likely impact on Jean Stinson when Florida's25% rate increase goes into effect tomorrow. The railroadconstruction contractor in Bartow, Fla., recalls howconstruction work &quot;died&quot; six years ago after her company'sliability costs -- of which workers' compensation is thebiggest part -- leaped 187% to $250,000. When she raised herbids to recoup the higher costs, customers put their projectson hold, she recounts.   The latest rate jump will force her to increase her bidsagain. &quot;Because we're in a recession, I'm afraid ourcustomers will again stop anything that is not absolutelynecessary,&quot; she says.   David Stephenson, legislative analyst for the NationalFederation of Independent Business, calls the projectedincreases &quot;alarmingly high,&quot; particularly after six years ofmore moderate double-digit increases of 10.1% to 11.9%.Generally, states set average allowable rates that can varydepending on the employer's industry, safety precautions ithas taken and its history of workplace injuries.   But small-business advocates complain that insurers oftenrefuse to gear premium prices for small companies to theirlevel of injury experience. &quot;Many small businesses aren'texperience-rated,&quot; says Mr. Stephenson. &quot;To beexperience-rated, you have to pay {a minimum} of about $5,000in premiums,&quot; he says. &quot;The insurance writers say they can'texperience-rate small owners with low premiums.&quot;   As a result, small businesses with a record of few or noinjuries often wind up in a risk pool for companies in theirindustry -- and pay about the same rate as companies withmore injuries. Some even get put into a costly state pool ofrisks that nobody wants. &quot;We have members that haven't had aclaim in years and still their premiums go up,&quot; Mr.Stephenson adds.   Indeed, the National Council on Compensation Insuranceexpects rates for the risk pools to rise even more thangeneral rates next year. The group insists, however, thatsmall companies aren't disproportionately represented in suchpools.   Clearly, small businesses are feeling the cost pinch.Surveys by the Insurance Research Council, an industry studygroup, show that since 1988, the number of small-businessowners that rate workers' compensation costs a &quot;majorconcern&quot; has climbed to 54% from 45%.   &quot;We have no control over what we pay,&quot; asserts BrianMiller, a heating, plumbing and air-conditioning contractorin Rural Hall, N.C. In the early 1980s, his company launchedwhat he calls an &quot;aggressive&quot; safety program -- and, he says,enjoys a better safety record than most companies in theindustry.   But he expects his workers' compensation costs will jumpnext year after being stable for the past few years. NorthCarolina's rate bureau has requested a 41% increase for 1992.Mr. Miller worries that the state regulator will permit anincrease of at least 25%.   Such a boost would slash his profits 20%, Mr. Millerclaims; he figures he wouldn't be able to recoup $20,000 to$40,000 in added insurance costs on his existing fixed-ratecontracts. What's more, because of the slow economy, hedoubts he can pass on the increases when he negotiates newcontracts.   Insurance specialists cite several factors for the heftyincreases in workers' compensation premiums. For one thing,medical-care costs for injured workers are shooting up evenfaster than medical costs in general. In addition, the rangeof job-related injuries covered by workers' compensation haswidened in recent years to include stress; carpal-tunnelsyndrome, a painful defect of the wrist and hand that isassociated with repetitive wrist movements; and age-relatedmaladies, among other things. And more cases are winding upin court, triggering rising legal costs.   The recession isn't helping either, adds Richard Victor,executive director of the Workers Compensation Institute, aCambridge, Mass., think tank. He notes that laid-off workersfacing the end of unemployment benefits have more incentiveto file claims than people who still have their jobs.   Small businesses next year plan to lobby state lawmakersand regulators in an effort to rein in rate increases. InFlorida, rate increases totaling 63% in two years promptedthe state legislature last year to trim the rate by 25%.Savings in payments for workers' lost wages were instituted,says William Herrle, the NFIB's state director, but littlewas done to corral medical or legal costs. As a result, hesays, rates in 1992 will jump again by 25%.   Also in Florida, small businesses will push to expand astate program that enables employers offering round-the-clockhealth insurance to be exempted from having to pay workers'compensation premiums for medical costs. Instead, employersneed only get coverage for the other common benefit: partialreplacement of lost pay.   Another item on the Florida small-business wish list is alegislative cap on lawyers' fees of $125 an hour and $50,000a case.   Meanwhile, some small businesses have gotten fed upwaiting for legislative reform. John Gibbons, owner ofMid-State Tire andamp; Service Inc., in East Greenwich, R.I., sayshe doesn't expect big reforms in his state's system anytimesoon. &quot;It's such a complex and deeply philosophical problemthat you just don't have a little laundry list of correctiveactions,&quot; he says.   His approach? He's opting out of the state system. Thisyear he contracted with an employee-leasing company to handlehis workers' compensation coverage, along with payroll andother services. As a result, he says, his workers'compensation costs this year dropped about 35% to $7,800.   But, he notes, that may not be the end of his costconcerns. The leasing company is signing up lots of employersnow, he says, and may find itself inundated with big claimswithin a few years.</TEXT></DOC>
