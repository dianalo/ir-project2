Hundreds of personal computer users found the virus wasprogrammed to delete files on Friday the 13th, said Alan Solomon,managing director of S and S Enterprises, a data recovery center inChesham.   ``It has been frisky and hundreds of people, including a largefirm with over 400 computers, have telephoned with their problems,''he said.   Several U.S. computer-security experts said they had not receivedany reports that the virus had cropped up inside the United States.   The virus bore many of the characteristics of one that had beenprogrammed to go off on Friday, May 13, 1988, the day before the40th anniversary of the establishment of the state of Israel. Thatvirus was first noticed at Hebrew University in Jerusalem and laterspread to Europe.   Security experts said it was logical that a virus that was set togo off on one Friday the 13th would also go off on subsequent Fridaythe 13ths unless it was completely eradicated. This was the firstFriday the 13th since the one in May 1988.   ``It is just a pesky nuisance and is causing a lot of problemstoday,'' said Solomon, who also is chairman of an IBM personalcomputer users group.   The virus apparently attacked Microsoft Corp.'s MS-DOS, thesoftware that runs the internal operations of the original line ofInternational Business Machines Corp. personal computers andcompatible models.   There were no estimates of how widespread the damage from thevirus was. The Israeli newspaper Maariv said that in one case theoriginal Israeli virus destroyed $15,000 worth of software and twodisks in which 7,000 hours of work had been invested.   The Israel virus, for some reason, possibly an error by itscreator, began eating up space and slowing down computers before May13, 1988. Solomon said the latest virus also ate up room incomputers and slowed them down before Friday.   A spokesman for IBM in Portsmouth, who did not want to beidentified further, confirmed the virus had wiped out files inpersonal computers made by IBM and compatible machines. The virusapparently did not affect personal computers in offices of IBMitself, however, said Colette Abissi, an IBM spokeswoman inPurchase, N.Y.   The identity of the hacker who devised the virus might never beknown, Solomon said.   ``The important thing is not to panic and start trying to deleteeverything in a bid to remove the virus as that can do untolddamage,'' he said.   As long as master disks are free from the virus, files can simplybe copied from them and used again, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
