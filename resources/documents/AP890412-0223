(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Change comes slowly down the two-lanehighway that winds through forests, dairy farms and cattle barnsinto Greensburg.   It's taken four decades for desegregation to reach the seat ofSt. Helena Parish, and even now a visitor looking for John Hall'shouse behind the Masonic lodge is asked, ``You talking about thewhite Masonic hall or the black one?''   ``This parish hasn't changed since 1907. ... Education has beenwhat kept it like it is,'' said Hall, a construction worker who hasspent 37 of his 70 years fighting to give black students _including his 14 children _ a chance.   Hall filed suit in 1952 after being told that the schooldistrict didn't have money to furnish a black school. Ironically,segregation ended because the district couldn't afford to keep itgoing. This semester is the first in St. Helena Parish with allblack and white students under the same roof.   Under a plan approved in December by U.S. District Judge JohnParker in Baton Rouge, classes were consolidated into threebuildings, including one that Hall and other black residents builtin the early 1950s.   ``I'm not trying to take credit for anything,'' Hall said. ``Iwanted my children to get an education and that's what they got.''   St. Helena Parish has one of Louisiana's poorest schooldistricts. About 95 percent of the parish's annual $6.5 millionbudget comes from the state. Until Jan. 6, its 2,040 students, 70percent of them black, attended seven schools.   ``There is no question the St. Helena Parish School Board hasbeen operated in violation of the U.S. Constitution,'' Parker saidin December, adding that consolidation ``means desegregation willbe accomplished.''   He said some of the schools ``are not fit for a dog house.''Superintendent Perry P. Spears said all seven were substandard.Spears, who is black and went to school here, plans to do away witha fifth school and is working to float a $7.5 million bond issuethis fall to improve the remaining two.   ``I enjoyed my elementary and high school career in St. Helena,but at the same time I knew that we were not being supportedequally,'' he said.   The point was driven home for Spears when he becamesuperintendent three years ago and saw that white schools hadequipment like washing machines and dryers for the athleticprograms. The black schools did not.   Back in the early 1950s, black students often sat on soft drinkcases, boxes and pieces of logs to listen to a teacher who didn'thave enough supplies ``or even a chair to sit down on,'' Hall said.``These schools were as bad as anything you've ever seen. I don'tknow why they'd send children up here to get an education at aplace like that. I'd rather put them under a tree.''   In 1952, he asked the board for a new black school. Officialstold him there wasn't enough money, but they made a deal _ buildthe school yourself and the parish will furnish it. The blackcommunity pitched in their meager assets and their elbow grease tobuild a new school. Hall returned to complete the deal _ and wastold there was no money for furnishings.   ``I told him right then that I'm going to take my children upthere to go to school with the white folks,'' he said. ``He tookhim a good laugh. He and his crew had a big fun-making deal aboutit, I understand.''   Hall didn't laugh. He, his father, and two other black residentswho still want to remain anonymous went to A.P. Tureaud, anattorney for the National Association for the Advancement ofColored People.   ``They said you're going to have some mad white folks here,''Hall said. ``I said I was already mad.'' Despite the warning, hesaid, the black residents faced ``nothing more than talk. All kindsof threats and talk.''   Although the Supreme Court outlawed segregated schools in 1954,Hall's suit and scores of other desegregation cases floated in thecourts for years.   In the 1960s, St. Helena Parish built a modern black highschool. A few blacks started going to white Greensburg High Schooland a few whites attended classes in the black schools. ``It wasall token desegregation,'' Hall said.   Segregation hurt both black and white students, he said. ``Youcan't hold back one race without holding the other back.''   Over the years, running seven schools used up the parish'sallotment of state-supported teacher salaries and resulted induplication of basic classes. As a result, few advanced classeswere offered and the students suffered.   ``We have not been able to offer a comprehensive curriculum,''Spears said. ``I feel that was the biggest disadvantage we had overthe years.''   Under consolidation, elementary school students eat lunch in amakeshift cafeteria set up in an old gymnasium, and some attendclass in trailers. Head Start pupils still go to the crampedbuilding that black residents built.   Most opposition came from parents, Spears said. ``They havecaused a problem by letting their kids see how much they opposeconsolidation. I don't think our kids generally opposeconsolidation.''   In fact, students give consolidation a mixed review.   ``It's going on pretty well now,'' said Pamecia Foskey, a blacksenior. ``It's all coming together. We're thinking of it as oneschool.''   ``It'll probably be better next year, but I won't be around tofind out,'' said Kelly Smith, a white sophomore who is going toprivate school in Mississippi next fall.   ``It's gone better than everybody thought,'' said DeAnn Fugler,a white sophomore who also plans to go to private school. ``It'stoo crowded right now. If the facility gets better, I might comeback. It's hard to tell.''   About 150 students, mostly white, have enrolled in privateschools or are illegally attending public schools in otherparishes, Spears said.   He is enthusiastic about the future, especially if the bondissue passes.   ``I think that the community is going to have more pride in itsschools. We won't have that competition between schools. Thecompetition is because we had all-white and all-black schools.''   A recent high school basketball game was an example of whatSpears hopes will become the rule. ``It was obvious that these werekids that had never been brought together before. The support waslike we hadn't had before. It's now one-and-one. I feel good aboutit. It's going to be a family relationship.''   Hall, who thought his lawsuit would be settled in four or fiveyears, isn't so sure. ``It will be slow, slow. The chance forchange will have to come with the new generation, not with none ofthe ones who are here now.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Tue AMs, April 18</NOTE><TEXT/></DOC>
