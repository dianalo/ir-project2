<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-27-0112 </DOCNO><TEXT>Multiaperture optics system are similar in design to the concepts applyingto the insect eye. Digitizing at the detector level is inherent in thesesystems. The fact that each eyelet forms one pixel of the overall imagelends itself to optical preprocessing. Therefore a simplified patternrecognition scheme can be used in connection with multiaperture opticssystems. The pattern recognition system used is based on the conjecturethat all shapes encountered can be dissected into a set of rectangles.This is accomplished by creating a binary image and comparing each rowof numbers starting at the top of the frame with the next row below.A set of rules is established which decides if the binary ones of thenext row are to be incorporated in the present rectangle or start a newrectangle. The number and aspect ratios of the rectangles formed constitutea recognition code. These codes are kept and updated in a library. Sincethe same shape may give rise to different recognition codes dependingon the attitude of the shape in respect to the detector grid, all shapesare rotated and normalized prior to dissecting. The rule is that thepattern is turned to maximize the number of straight edges which lineup with the detector grid. The mathematical mechanism for rotation ofthe shape is described. Assuming a-priori knowledge of the size of theobject exists, the normalization procedure can be used for distance determination.The description of the hardware for acquisition of the image is provided.</TEXT></DOC>
