Then in May of this year, after I'd posted my final spring plant bids, mail order, some &quot;Asters&quot; (Monet's) sold for $9.4 million at Christie's and &quot;Young Girl Wearing a Hat With Wildflowers&quot; (Renoir's) moved for $13.8 million at Sotheby's. And while a nonfloral self-portrait, &quot;Yo Picasso,&quot; went for $47.9 million at the same sale as &quot;Wildflowers,&quot; Picasso didn't come close to some very common &quot;Irises&quot; (Van Gogh's) that had been disposed of for $53.9 million in 1987 by the same house, and that remain the most expensive irises and painting in the world. All this hothouse bidding drove John Russell to rail in the New York Times that &quot;in the month of May 1989&quot; the New York auction rooms &quot;doubled as gambling room, vanity parade and surrogate stock market, with overtones of bullring, prize ring, cockfight, dogfight and man fight. . . . every last instinct of greed and cupidity and ostentation was let loose.&quot;    Mr. Russell just goes to the wrong auctions. I would like to recommend to him and you a decidedly kinder, genteeler sale, viz., the Rare Plant Auction of the Wilmington Garden Center, whose ninth running I attended about the time Mr. Russell was exposing his tender self to the brutalities of the ChristoSoth cockpits. The Wilmington auction took place decorously under glass in the conservatories of Longwood Gardens, Pierre Samuel du Pont's former country retreat.    Neither Donald Trump nor Leona Helmsley nor Boone Pickens was among the 400 plant lovers intent on peaceful takeovers of the more than 300 lots. Certainly, there were no straws, no anonymous bidders calling in from Yokohama. The closest this sale got to the secrecy of the ChristoSoth universe was a silent auction, which was carried on through written bids, but buyers used their own names and wrote them themselves, without assistance or gold pens. During the live auction, they showed their own hands and faces. And the RPA proceeds, instead of re-enriching the rich, go for inner-city greenworks administered by the non-profit Wilmington Garden Center: the Greening of Wilmington Plantmobile, which assists with community gardens, tree plantings and neighborhood gardening and conservation education.    The &quot;Irises&quot; of this auction was a &quot;Clivia miniata&quot; &quot;Yellow Form,&quot; donated by Macrae Parker Jr., a New York businessman, famous as the RPA's big bidder. Whispering during the silent auction, I asked him about clivia (which I rhymed with trivia). &quot;Clive-ia,&quot; he tut-tutted genially. &quot;I've had them all my life, but I'd always had orange clive-ia. In Connecticut I had 25 tubs. After I'd seen a yellow cliveia at the Philadelphia Flower Show, I decided I never wanted to leave this watery planet without a yellow clive-ia.&quot;    A fellow plantsman, Richard Both (&quot;I was vice president of explosives at Hercules&quot;) broke in: &quot;This man Parker came out of the blue to our first auction eight years ago. He wanted yellow clive-ia, started at $300 and ended at $1,200]&quot;    Mr. Parker chimed in: &quot;I met Ruth du Pont there. Her mother and I were bidding on the same yellow clive-ia. I asked Ruth du Pont, 'Do you think I can buy that clive-ia for $500?' And she said, 'There are men in Wilmington who'd trade their wives for that plant]' The yellow clive-ia is the best investment I've ever made] When I went to collect it there was a note attached from the donor, Sir John Thouron {of Scotland and Pennsylvania}: 'Please do not attempt to divide this for several years]'&quot;    Sir John had gone to Belgium for his yellow C., which spawned all the others in the U.S., not to mention the Rare Plant Auction itself. Mr. Parker waited six years before quartering his yellow, and two more before giving one of the scions to the RPA. This well-begot clivia spent the evening under a spotlight and sold for $600 to a two-couple clivia consortium.    Almost anyone could see why these four were willing to pool assets in this way, even at risk of intertwining their lives rather closely at bloom time. But why would anyone want to take pen in hand for a pachysandra, that plebe among ground covers, in a sale of rarities? To ward off such dubiety, the RPA catalog began contritely, &quot;pachysandra is often scorned for being too plain and too common&quot; (Leona Helmsley once added 10,000 of the common sort to her queenly Connecticut estate), but &quot;P. terminalis&quot; &quot;Green Sheen,&quot; it asserted, was &quot;this sensational cultivar.&quot; Dale Chapman, nurseryman, had donated it. He is a quondam chemical engineer whose Hampton, Conn., company's motto is &quot;EUONYMUS WE GOTIMUS]&quot; &quot;I've been in ground covers 21 years,&quot; he began his &quot;Green Sheen&quot; peroration. &quot;It's the shiniest pachysandra I or anyone has ever seen. It was just a sport I happened to discover in 1978. I really believe in this pachysandra. I'm a man of faith in God. I really feel that pachysandra 'Green Sheen' is a gift that God has given me.&quot; Mr. Chapman's verdant manna sold to William Ross McLaughlin for $65.    If anyone still needed convincing about the rareness of &quot;Green Sheen,&quot; Robert Herald, chairman of the Wilmington Garden Center's (Rare) Plant Selection Committee, was on hand to say: &quot;That pachysandra is a new cultivar and a dramatic improvement. But some people don't like pachysandra and so they consider it not an improvement. Whoever bought that pachysandra will be one of the very few people in Delaware to have it.&quot; This was no hollow chauvinism, Mr. Herald explained, because Delaware is &quot;a very special, horticulturally rich area. There are some very discriminating gardeners in this crowd,&quot; people whose cutting-edge taste ensures that &quot;the auction definitely follows gardening trends. Hostas, day lilies, grasses -- they're trendy plants now. They're in vogue. We put together a wish list of all the donors and we try to offer the most current cultivars.&quot;    Among the au courant plants: Hostas &quot;Great Expectations,&quot; and &quot;Pizzazz&quot;; day lilies &quot;Heavenly Guide,&quot; &quot;Techny Peace&quot; and &quot;Satchmo&quot;; a Once Upon A Windowsill, Aspidistra. Dilatush Nursery had sent a &quot;Cedrela sinensis&quot;. There was an Ogeechee-lime from the North Carolina State University Arboretum. Other mouth-filling rarities included: Vaccinium crassifolium&quot;, &quot;Viburnum bitchiuense&quot;, &quot;Sycoparrotia semidecandra&quot;, and the &quot;Miscanthus sinensis&quot; &quot;Malepartus&quot; of Mrs. J. Pancoast Reath.    Mrs. Lammot du Pont Copeland's False Goldenrod went to David Baker for $17. The Korean Goatsbeard from Waterloo Gardens went to Mr. and Mrs. Eleuthere I. du Pont for a $23 song. (The same du Ponts landed the &quot;Heptacodium jasminoides&quot; &quot;Seven-son Flower&quot; from Harvard for $53.) A post-Monet dwarf water-lily &quot;Nymphaea pygmea&quot; &quot;Helvola&quot; joined the private collection of Mr. and Mrs. Curtis R. Bollar for $35. The Classical Cherub Garden Sculpture and the &quot;winsome pig made of cast cement,&quot; $275 and $150 respectively, went to Dr. and Mrs. John Noseworthy.    Mrs. William McCabe was thrilled to buy an illusion for $350 -- a Trompe l'Oeil Garden Trellis. Mrs. Joanna Reed's Stinking Hellebore joined John J. Feliciani for $31. Mr. Lynn Kippax was overheard saying: &quot;I got my first double hernia for $180 -- that Knot Garden.&quot; (Trough With Knot Garden of Boxwoods.) When the False Climbing Hydrangea (&quot;Schizophragma hydrangeoides&quot;) sold for $475 at live auction, Amanda Gehret remarked, &quot;I bought a climbing hydrangea four years ago and it's done absolutely nothing but crawl. But some people go on the theory that the more you spend for it, the better it'll grow.&quot;    The Rare Plant Auction made $29,000 for the Wilmington Garden Center without greed, cupidity or ostentation surfacing even once and provoked not a single snarl from the flower-art auction prize rings in New York. </TEXT></DOC>
