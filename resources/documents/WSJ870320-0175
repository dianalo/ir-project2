Today, we've got about 30%. It isn't a question of whether banking will occur; it will. It's a question of whether banking will be done by banks. And I have never had it proved to me why banks are such bad bankers and everyone else is such a good banker. . . .    Of course I'm an optimist. But to be optimistic about the year 2050 isn't very helpful. And that is why we as a bank are in the middle of trying to decide whether to remain a bank or whether to give up our banking charter. </TEXT></DOC>
