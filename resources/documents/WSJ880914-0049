Nomani (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> CMD MIN </IN><DATELINE> CHICAGO  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Corn and soybean futures prices rose in response to a reduced U.S. government estimate of the Soviet grain harvest and renewed concern about projections of tight U.S. stockpiles.    Industry analysts had expected prices to fall significantly after the release late Monday of an Agriculture Department crop report that showed less drought damage to U.S. soybean and corn harvests than had been anticipated.    In fact, soybeans for November delivery tumbled in early trading yesterday to a low for the day of $8.66 a bushel, and corn futures for December delivery fell to $2.945 a bushel. Both, however, closed higher after an afternoon of heavy buying. November soybeans climbed seven cents a bushel to $8.89 a bushel. December corn rose 0.5 cent a bushel to $2.995 a bushel.    &quot;It was a wonderful day,&quot; said John Frazier, a trader at Balfour Maclaine Futures Inc., Chicago. &quot;When you really studied the report, it was friendly.&quot;    Among other things, the department lowered its estimate of the Soviet grain crop by five million metric tons to 205 million tons for this year and raised its estimate of Soviet grain imports by two million metric tons to 27 million tons for the year ending Aug. 31, 1989.    Also, prices were buoyed by the report's prediction of deterioration of the wheat crop in Canada, a major U.S. competitor in world markets.    The report also signaled tight supplies in the coming year for corn, soybeans and wheat. U.S. soybean stockpiles before next fall's harvest are expected to shrink to only 100 million bushels, less than a threeweek supply. Wheat futures prices rose throughout the day, with contracts for December delivery closing yesterday at $4.2675 a bushel, up 9.75 cents a bushel.    In corn, talk of more Soviet purchases of U.S. corn buoyed prices. Traders disagreed on the amount of the rumored purchase, but some speculated that one million to two million metric tons will be sold to the Soviets.    After the close of trading, the Agriculture Department confirmed the sale of 350,000 metric tons of corn to the Soviets, bringing this year's total Soviet corn purchases to almost three million metric tons.    In other commodity markets yesterday:   COPPER: Futures prices rose to new highs for the third consecutive day. December-delivery copper ended at $1.0390 a pound for a gain of 1.90 cents, after establishing a new life-of-contract high of $1.04. One analyst noted that the open interest -- outstanding contracts that haven't been offset by opposite trades or delivery of the commodity -- have been rising along with prices. The total open interest in copper rose by 212 contracts yesterday, to 35,583. &quot;This is no short-covering rally,&quot; he said, &quot;That's new buying that will continue to support the market if it keeps coming in.&quot; He also noted that concern over possible disruption of supplies, especially in Peru and Chile, is helping the September futures contract to increase its premium over more distant deliveries. He said the premium of September over December now is about five cents a pound, up from about 2.80 cents at the end of August.    SUGAR: Futures prices advanced on concern over problems that Hurricane Gilbert might cause in the Caribbean and on a spurt of buying of physical sugar in the world market. The March-delivery contract rose 0.31 cent a pound to 10.34 cents. One dealer observed that the hurricane might disrupt shipments and the normal handling of sugar in Cuba, a major exporter. Egypt bought an estimated 84,000 tons of refined sugar, far more than the 24,000 tons it had been expected to buy, the dealer said. In addition, Libya bought 24,000 tons of refined sugar, he said.    COTTON: Futures prices rose as traders tracked the progress of Hurricane Gilbert across the Caribbean toward the Gulf of Mexico. The December contract advanced 1.41 cents a pound to 54.07 cents. One analyst speculated that the storm might hit land between Tampico, Mexico, and Corpus Christi, Texas, but he cautioned that it was still too early to make a firm prediction. A meteorologist and trading adviser, James Roemer, of Weather Trades Inc., in Des Moines, Iowa, observed that &quot;Hurricanes can fool meteorologists at the very last instant as they create their own flow patterns.&quot; However, he said, mid-morning indications yesterday &quot;suggested that it could move close to the Mississippi Delta by Thursday or Friday.&quot; The hurricane has winds exceeding 100 miles an hour, which would slow down when the storm hits land, but heavy rains nonetheless could cause damage in Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas, the analyst said. However, he noted, there is less concern among merchants and traders about what damage to the crop could do to prices than there is among speculators. He said there is expected to be a carryover of 8.2 million bales on July 31, 1989, from the current crop. &quot;If you add 13 million from the next crop, you have a total of over 21 million bales,&quot; he said. &quot;Consumption could account for about 11 million bales, leaving about 10 million bales. If the hurricane causes a loss of as much as 500,000 bales, a high figure, there still will be about 9.5 million bales left, which is regarded as a bearish carryover,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
