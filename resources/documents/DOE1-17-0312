The CRHL study is designed to provide informationthat will facilitate the evaluation of risks to human beings from medicalexposure during early development. This is a long-term (lifespan) studyof a moderately large and long-lived mammal exposed at one of severaltimes during development to a relatively small and discrete dose of externalradiation. Ages-at-irradiation selected for comparison reflect the primaryconcern with medical exposures during the development period. The basisexperiment under this contract contains 1,680 beagles that will be maintainedand evaluated for most of their natural lives. Commitment of animalsbegan in December 1967 and was completed in October 1972. The annualreport summarizes the current status of the study for the reporting periodof November 21, 1985 through November 20, 1986.</TEXT></DOC>
