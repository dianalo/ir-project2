HARPAZ</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Soviet foreign minister called Monday for aninternational ``New Deal'' to avert an impending economic disasterfueled by militarization, Third World debt, poverty andenvironmental problems.   ``Right before our eyes the world is sliding into a deepeconomic depression,'' Eduard Shevardnadze said in a speech inManhattan sponsored by the Foreign Policy Association.   ``The debt of the Third World countries, the interest they haveto pay and the pace of their economic development _ are these notthe signs of an impending catastrophe?''   He added: ``We could one day begin competing not for politicalsupremacy or spheres of influence but for access to water, freshair and even a green lawn.''   Shevardnadze told the audience of about 350 people that theabolition of nuclear weapons, forgiveness of some Third World debtsand increased protection for the environment will be essential forpeace and worldwide stability in the next century.   ``Radical bold steps are needed, a kind of `New Deal,' atransition to a policy that would draw developing countries intothe scientific, technological and information revolution,'' he said.   In the 1930s during the Great Depression, President Franklin D.Roosevelt promised Americans a ``New Deal'' of government-sponsoredsocial welfare programs.   Shevardnadze compared pessimism over the future of perestroika,the economic liberalization of the Soviet Union, to pessimism overthe future of capitalism during the 1930s in the United States.   He noted that in 1931, 100,000 Americans requested permission toemigrate to the Soviet Union.   ``There were bread lines in New York's Times Square and tents ofthe jobless huddled along Riverside Drive,'' he said, adding: ``Itis well known that in those years there were widespreadexpectations in left-wing circles that the severe crisis of theworld capitalist system would finally bring about the worldrevolution.''   He said the Soviet Union's ``economic system is undergoing anadjustment. ... Something similar happened in the Unites States 60years ago.''   But he predicted that ``so long as there is the will, theunderstanding of the situation and the determination to changethings for the better _ and we certainly have them _ the economycan remedy its ills.''</TEXT></DOC>
