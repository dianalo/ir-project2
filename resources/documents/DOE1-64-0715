The operating policy sought must take into accountthe stochasticity of the river flows and minimize the expected operationcost while satisfying a set of reliability constraints. It must alsobe applicable to a large number of reservoirs. The approach consistsin selecting an operating policy at the outset and adjust its parametersso as to come as close as possible to the optimal solution. The conditionsunder which the operating policy is optimal are given in the paper.</TEXT></DOC>
