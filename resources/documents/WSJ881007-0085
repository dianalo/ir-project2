Stock funds as a group edged down an average of 0.73% in the third period, but they still had a nine-month return of more than 12%, according to Lipper Analytical Services Inc. It was only the second quarterly decline in the past two years for stock funds. The other was in last year's fourth quarter, which included the Black Monday market crash.    Investors in income-related funds managed to eke out a gain. All but one of the eight leading fund categories for the quarter boasted relatively high current income, a feature many investors have latched onto amid the current stock-market uncertainty.    &quot;As people realize that inflation isn't the big bogeyman they thought it was, those income-related funds are really cranking,&quot; said Kurt Brouwer, a San Francisco investment adviser specializing in mutual funds.    Stock funds as a group trailed the Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index for both the third quarter and the nine months. The Sandamp;P 500 had a quarterly gain of 0.33%, assuming reinvestment of dividends. Most types of stock funds lost a little ground. Only two stock funds out of the 1,568 of all types tracked by Lipper posted double-digit quarterly gains.    &quot;If you held up for the third quarter, you were doing well; it was a tough one,&quot; says Peter Lynch, who runs Fidelity Investments' Magellan Fund, the U.S.'s largest stock fund.    Fixed-income funds as a group rose 1.71% in the quarter. Still, not all bond-fund investors could take heart. Fixed-income gains were uneven at best, with government bond funds generally declining and high-yield &quot;junk&quot; funds generally gaining, according to Lipper.    A final fixed-income breakdown for the quarter won't be available for a few days, Lipper said.    &quot;It looks like it's a high-yield game,&quot; says Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical.    Consider Brian Clapper, an investor who works as a software developer for the Defense Department in Warminster, Pa. Mr. Clapper says he considers himself a &quot;cautious&quot; investor but craves the high yield his First Investors Fund for Income offers. Even if the economy falters and the junk market slumps, he says, he'll stick it out with his junk fund.    &quot;It can't get any worse than what banks are paying you,&quot; he says of his fund's yield, which currently is 11.78%.    There were no clear-cut leaders, but the third quarter's best-performing group was utility funds, boosted by the allure of safe dividends. Other income-oriented stock funds posting gains included equity income funds and growth and income funds.    Small-company growth funds, the big winners the first six months, slumped during the third quarter, falling 2.5%. Despite the respite, some fund managers remain convinced that small companies will continue to outperform larger-capitalization issues.    The second quarter's leading group, science and technology funds, was a big loser in the latest period, slumping more than 6%. Yet some fund specialists expect a further bounce in these funds, too. Mr. Brouwer says, &quot;When you see big institutions dumping technology stocks, you know the bottom is near.&quot;    At least one fund group, however, isn't expected to rebound much anytime soon. Gold funds, which were laggards in recent quarters, trailed all other fund groups this time around, too.    More than half of the bottom 25 performers among stock funds were gold-related. As long as inflation remains in check, analysts say, these funds aren't likely to do much.    Some familiar names continue to crop up among the poorer-performing funds: 44 Wall Street Fund, for instance, remains the worst performer over the past five years and 10 years, losing 84% and 66%, respectively.    And not all high-yield funds did well. American Asset Yield Fund, which focuses on stocks with yields of 5% or better, was the worst-performing fund for the year to date and the 12 months ended Sept. 30, losing 63% and 77%, respectively. One reason: unusually large expenses.    One aspect of the latest quarter's performance is at odds with a longer-term trend: Bond and income funds' recent return outstripped that of stock funds, but the reverse has been true for the long haul. In the past 10 years, stock funds have averaged a return of 294%, compared with 164% for fixed-income funds, according to Lipper.    The 10-year performance &quot;shows what has been the more normal experience of investors over long periods,&quot; Mr. Lipper says. &quot;We would expect this relationship to be reasserted in the future.&quot;    ---                    Markets by the Slice                                        TOTAL RETURN                                   -----------------------                                     THIRD        9/30/87- FUND CATEGORY                     QUARTER        9/30/88 Utility                          +  2.01%       +  4.53% - Fixed income                     +  1.71        + 10.61 Income                           +  1.67        +  5.92 Equity income                    +  1.14        +  4.76 Option income                    +  0.53        -  6.32 Balanced                         +  0.47        -  2.51 Growth and income                +  0.38        -  7.03 Health/Biotechnology             +  0.09        - 17.39 World income                     -  0.04        +  9.57 Specialty                        -  0.50        -  9.59 Convertible securities           -  0.72        -  6.08 Option growth                    -  0.79        +  0.96 Growth                           -  0.96        - 12.10 Capital appreciation             -  1.60        - 12.45 International                    -  1.72        - 11.99 Global                           -  1.73        - 13.85 Small company growth             -  2.48        - 10.51 Natural resources                -  3.10        - 16.65 Science and technology           -  6.32        - 20.05 Gold oriented                    - 10.40        - 34.70 Average general equity funds     -  0.73        - 10.26 Sandamp;P's 500-with dividends         +  0.33%       - 12.38%   Source: Lipper Analytical Services Inc.</TEXT></DOC>
