Political observers gave the Socialists the edge in the voting inthe more than 36,500 communities choosing mayors and city councilmembers in Sunday's first round of voting. The second round takesplace March 19 in towns where no party wins an absolute majority.   Television and radio coverage of the campaigns was forbidden asof midnight Friday. All polls were banned at the start of the weekin keeping with French electoral rules.   The extreme right National Front made last-minute calls to theconservative right to join in second-round alliances.   ``If there can be no such accord, too bad for them,'' NationalFront leader Jean-Marie Le Pen said Thursday night.   Le Pen is running in Paris' 20th district, a working-classquarter dominated by Asian and North African immigrants.   It remained unclear to what extent conservatives would need theNational Front, which stunned the nation when Le Pen gained acrucial 14 percent of the vote in the first round of Maypresidential elections.   Any sizable Socialist loss would be seen as a judgment on thegovernment of Socialist Premier Michel Rocard. But that seemedunlikely to happen because recent popularity polls give high ratingsto Rocard and President Francois Mitterrand.   The Socialists expect to gain control of as many as 20 additionalcities with more than 30,000 people.   However, Jean-Marie Le Guen, first secretary of the SocialistFederation of Paris, conceded Friday he was worried voters might notgo to the polls. He accused conservative Mayor Jacques Chirac of``refusing to call Parisians to their civic duties.''   Chirac, who has campaigned on issues such as traffic, environmentand housing, was in no danger of losing his job in the city he hasheld since 1977. His Socialist opponent, Interior Minister PierreJoxe, has all but conceded defeat.   Joxe has indicated he would be satisfied if the conservativeslost several of Paris' 20 districts, where they now have a totalmonopoly.   A loss of even one Paris district would be a setback for Chirac,the head of the Rally for the Republic. Chirac has been trying torebuild his power base, which eroded after his defeat in the Maypresidential election to Mitterrand.   In Lyon, the age factor has become an issue with 78-year-oldincumbant Mayor Francisque Collomb, a centrist, facing Michel Noirof Chirac's RPR, who at 45 is considered the favorite.   In the Socialist bastion of Marseille, Mayor Robert Vigouroux,favored to win re-election, was ousted from the Socialist Party whenhe refused to step aside in favor of the official Socialistcandidate, Michel Pezet.   Center-right candidate Jean-Claude Gaudin also is a candidate.</TEXT></DOC>
