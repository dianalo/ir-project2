Bradley, 71, was cheered at the inauguration by thousands ofsupporters, whose presence displaced the homeless people who usuallyrecline beneath huge fig trees on the lawn.   ``I am determined that no difficulty will deflect us,'' saidBradley, the subject of several investigations into allegations offinancial wrongdoing, including improper ties with banks that dobusiness with the city.   ``The headlines will come and go; the 30-second sound bites willbe heard and then fade and be forgotten,'' the mayor said.   ``What will remain long after we are gone ... are the doors ofopportunity that have been opened; the air that has been cleaned;the neighborhoods that have been given new life; a generation thathas been given new hope,'' Bradley said.   Bradley promised increased efforts to control gangs and drugsales, to press his plan to cut the number of trucks on city streetsduring rush hour by 70 percent, and said he would soon announce amajor program to keep storm drains from polluting bay waters. Thecity's overtaxed sewage system repeatedly has overflowed and spilledinto Santa Monica and San Pedro bays.   Bradley said he would ``settle for nothing less'' than $2 billionworth of tax increment revenues to be committed to the ``largestmunicipal housing and homeless plan in American history.''   ``There is something fundamentally wrong in Los Angeles when10,000 parents and their children are completely homeless; when40,000 of our families live in garages; and 150,000 pay more thanhalf of their income for rent.''   Bradley has enjoyed relative popularity during his 16 years asmayor.   InApril's nonpartisan mayoral primary, Bradley defeated CityCouncilman Nate Holden with 52 percent of the vote, just enough toavoid a general election. A far stronger opponent, Councilman ZevYaroslavsky, had pulled out of the race months earlier, saying hebelieved the mayor was unbeatable.   In the previous election, Bradley was re-elected with 67 percentof the vote.   Bradley has failed twice in runs for governor. In his first try,he lost to George Deukmejian in 1982 by just 1.2 percent of the vote.   Recent newspaper reports prompted the city attorney to launch aconflict-of-interest investigation of Bradley on March 31. The stateFair Political Practices Commission later began its own probe.   Questions arose about whether Bradley had exchanged politicalfavors for preferential treatment at Drexel Burnham Lambert, theinvestment banking firm that pioneered the use of controversial``junk bonds.''   The U.S. Justice Department and the Securities and ExchangeCommission later opened additional investigations.   Bradley told the City Council on May 10 that he had done nothingillegal and would be vindicated.</TEXT></DOC>
