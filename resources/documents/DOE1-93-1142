<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-93-1142 </DOCNO><TEXT>A study was performed as part of the Civilian Radioactive Waste ManagementProgram to quantify the level and effect of noise from the various majorphases of development of the proposed potentially acceptable nuclearwaste repository site at Richton Dome, Mississippi. This report containsthe results of a predictive noise level study for the site characterization,repository construction, and repository operational phases. Includedherein are graphic representations of energy averaged day/night soundlevels representing impact zones expected during each phase. Sound levelsfrom onsite and offsite activity including traffic on highways and railroadroutes are presented in isopleth maps. A description of the EnvironmentalNoise Prediction Model used for the study, the study basis and methodologies,and actual modeling data are provided. Noise and vibration levels fromblasting are also predicted and evaluated. Protective noise criteriacontaining a margin of safety are used for persons in relation to residences,schools, churches, and agricultural areas. Protective ground motion criteriafor residential dwelling and for human annoyance are used in the evaluation.The evaluation provides the bases for assessing the noise impacts fromthe related activities at the proposed repository. 24 refs., 8 figs.,8 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
