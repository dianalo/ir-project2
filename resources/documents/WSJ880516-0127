The unusually hefty payment for members of the large insurance market follows big damage awards by U.S. courts recently, said Peter J. Maitland, chairman of the syndicate's underwriting company, CJW Underwriting Agencies Ltd. He said the cash injection by members of Lloyd's Syndicate 553 will offset mostly U.S. claims of as much as #70 million. The claims come from soaring damage awards for medical malpractice, officers' and directors' liability and other coverage.    A Lloyd's spokesman said the investors, who last year paid #4.5 million to cover losses, may be asked for further payments if new claims arise.    Mr. Maitland said Syndicate 553's losses appear to result from both the high claims and the failure to demand large enough premiums. He added the losses don't appear to stem from any misconduct by individual underwriters.    At Lloyd's, underwriting agencies organize syndicates of members, known as &quot;names,&quot; to underwrite insurance policies. Lloyd's members accept unlimited personal liability for losses on underwriting in return for premium and investment income. </TEXT></DOC>
