Subtitle D, of this Act reauthorizedthe Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) through Federal Fiscal Year 1994.The Office for Victims of Crime was established in 1984 within the U.S.Department of Justice to serve as the Federal focal point for victim issuesand to administer the Victims of Crime Act of 1984, as amended. For thefirst time Section 1411 of the Act legislatively established an Officefor Victims of Crime within the Justice Programs, U.S. Department of Justice.The Direct is appointed by the President and reports to the Attorney Generalthrough the Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Justice Programs,and has final authority for all grants, cooperative agreements, and contractsawarded by the Office for Victims of Crime. The Director is responsiblefor administering funds made available under sections 1402, 1403, and 1404of the Act. Funds made available under Section 1402(d)(2) (A)(ii) and (D)(ii)are utilized by the States to support a variety of eligible crime victimassistance programs. In any given year, approximately 1,500 programs receivepartial funding support with VOCA funds.Section 1402(d)(2) (A) states that ``Of the first $100,000,000 depositedin the Fund in a particular fiscal year * * * 1% shall be available forgrants under section 1404(c) * * *'' Section 1404(c)(1) of the Act statesthat the Director shall make grants (A) for training and technical assistanceservices to eligible crime victim assistance programs; and (B) for thefinancial support of services to victims of Federal crime by eligible crimevictim assistance programs.Of the 1% available for this purpose, up to one-half of one percent isauthorized for training and technical assistance and at least one-halfof one percent is authorized for victims of Federal crimes. This year amajor portion of these funds will be allocated for services to victimsof Federal crimes on Indian reservations. The remainder of the funds willbe available for training and technical assistance for eligible victimassistance programs.Over the last three years the Office of Justice Programs has awarded fundsto provide training to victim assistance program staff.

Funds supporting theseprojects have come from the Victims of Crime Act and the Justice AssistanceAct.<ITAG tagnum="84">Statement of Problem  </ITAG>Although crime has been a problem of great national concern for decades,it only has been in the last ten years that the plight of the crime victimhas been brought to the Nation's attention. Shortly after assuming office,President Reagan established the President's Task Force on Victims of Crime.He was concerned that the scales of justice were out of balance and thatvictims of crime were not being treated with the dignity, fairness andcourtesy which they deserved. After holding six public hearings the TaskForce issued a final report in December 1982, making 68 recommendationson how treatment of crime victims could be improved. Out of that reportcame the following Federal initiatives: (1) The establishment of the Officefor Victims of Crime, and (2) passage of the Victims of Crime Act of 1984. Since the enactment of VOCA there has been a considerable increase in thenumber and type of victim assistance programs operating in the United States.As a result, there is an ongoing need for technical assistance and trainingfor victim service program staff. Funds will be made available to meetthis need through this announcement.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Purpose  </ITAG>The OVC is making available $150,000 for the development and presentationof regional training conferences for crime victim assistance service providers. <ITAG tagnum="84">Program Description  </ITAG>One grant will be awarded for the purpose of developing and presentingup to five regional training conferences throughout the United States.There are no attendance restrictions, however, preference should be givento VOCA-funded program staff in cases where space or type of training mightnecessitate limitation of attendance.
