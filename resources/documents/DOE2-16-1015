The prepared films were about5000A in thickness. The X-ray diffraction experiments were carried outand the lattice parameters, a/sub 0/, were calculated. To obtain thevalue of T/sub c/, the electrical resistance was measured. If we assumethat the same compositions in NbH/sub x/ and NbD/sub x/ correspond tothe same lattice parameters, a/sub 0/, then a pronounced normal isotopeeffect was observed. At a/sub 0/ = 3.4A, hydrogen absorption reducesT/sub c/ by 2.8K while deuterium absorption reduces T/sub c/ by 3.9K.</TEXT></DOC>
