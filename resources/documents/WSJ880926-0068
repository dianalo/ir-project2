This ritual exercise is known as &quot;window dressing.&quot; But in these abnormal times in the market, some &quot;window undressing&quot; might be in order instead. With just five trading days to go now, the odds are good that cash will outperform the stock market this quarter.    Cash (as represented by three-month Treasury bills) has earned an annualized return above 6.6% throughout the quarter and currently yields more than 7%. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average will have to move up 51.03 points this week just to equal its June 30 close of 2141.71.    It will be another month or so before full third-quarter figures are available from the Investment Company Institute to show whether mutual funds have been loading up on cash. But at the end of July, the only third-quarter month for which the trade association has released figures, U.S. mutual funds held a hefty 10.6% of their assets in cash, compared with 10.1% in June.    Others with high cash levels are keeping them high. &quot;We're not increasing our cash levels right now, but we are keeping them relatively high -- 25% of our equity portfolios,&quot; says Michael Flament, vice president, investment analysis, at Wright Investors' Service, Bridgeport, Conn.    At this time last year -- with the stock market crash less than a month ahead -- the conservative manager and adviser of about $4 billion of assets was urgently warning clients of an impending market rout and shifting 35% of its equity portfolio assets into short-term government securities.    Wright eased to the 25%-cash policy late last year and has maintained it ever since. Yet even this much cash hasn't been enough to keep the typical Wright portfolio's head above water in the current quarter. Mr. Flament says that while the cash portion of the typical Wright equity fund has gained about 1% this quarter, the three-quarters of it invested in stocks has declined in value by about 2.7%.    However, Wall Street firms, hurt by sagging commission revenue, prefer another view. Lee Cooperman, Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co.'s partner in charge of investment research, cites a longer investment horizon -- Jan. 1 to Sept. 1 -- in which the Standard andamp; Poor's 500 stocks, assuming reinvestment of dividends, rose 12.3%, swamping both the 6.1% return from longterm government bonds and the 4.4% return on three-month T-bills.    &quot;From this longer view, cash is clearly the worst investment and stocks the best,&quot; Mr. Cooperman says.    ---   The recent two-page spread by Merrill Lynch was bold and urgent. &quot;For the sixth time in nine years, Merrill Lynch is making a major market recommendation,&quot; says the big headline in the ads, which ran Thursday in some newspapers. &quot;The time to buy is now.&quot;    The text says Merrill recommends bonds and interest-rate-sensitive stocks. The reason: &quot;Our research experts believe that the forward momentum of the economy is slowing somewhat.&quot;    With inflation likely to remain modest, Merrill says, it sees interest rates &quot;declining appreciably over the next 15 months and beyond.&quot; It adds, &quot;We believe strongly that investors should begin now to participate in the attractive returns available in both bonds and selected stock groups.&quot;    With all this urgency, you might think Merrill's research experts had just come up with this recommendation -- but no. Charles Clough, Merrill's chief market strategist, says it has been in effect since April.    Since then, Merrill has been advising customers to put 40% of their investments in stocks, 45% in bonds and 15% in cash. Merrill has also been recommending a 33% weighting of interest-sensitive issues within stock portfolios.    &quot;This is what we've been saying for the last few months,&quot; Mr. Clough says.    -- Randall Smith   ---   Friday's Market Activity   Stock prices, led by blue-chip issues, moved higher in the latter portion of another lackluster session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average remained just below the 2100 level, where it has stayed for a week and a half.    Friday's gain of 10.67 left the average at 2090.68, down 7.47 points, or 0.4%, for the week. After early weakness amid inflation concerns, sparked by news of a 6% rise in August durable-goods orders, the industrials quickly turned higher, but other market measures lagged.    There were 744 issues advancing in price on the New York Stock Exchange, while 681 declined. Big Board volume of 145,100,000 shares was down from 150,670,000 Thursday.    Among leading blue chips, International Business Machines gained 7/8 to 112 7/8, General Motors went up 7/8 to 73 5/8, Aluminum Co. of America advanced 3/4 to 51, F.W. Woolworth added 1 1/4 to 53 3/4, Boeing rose 1 1/8 to 61 3/8, and Coca-Cola climbed 1 to 43 1/2.    Baxter International fell 1 5/8 to 18 1/8 and was the most active issue, on composite volume of nearly eight million shares. The sell-off reflected reaction to the company's announcement late Thursday that its 1988 earnings will fall short of analysts' estimates of $1.40 to $1.50 a share.    Cooper Tire andamp; Rubber, which hit a 52-week high Thursday, gained 1 3/4 to 24 5/8 amid speculation about a possible buy-out of the company. </TEXT></DOC>
