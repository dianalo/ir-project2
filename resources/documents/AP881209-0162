(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President-elect George Bush's policytoward the Soviet Union shouldn't be based entirely on thepronouncements and personality of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, sincethere's no guarantee he'll stay in power, former secretaries ofstate said Friday.   ``Gorbachev acts as he does because he recognizes that the Sovieteconomy is a mess and it has to be improved,'' Henry Kissinger,secretary of state under former presidents Richard Nixon and GeraldFord, told a news conference. ``It's a big mistake to gear ourpolicies totally to one Soviet personality.''   Cyrus Vance, who directed foreign policy under presidents John F.Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson, said Gorbachev faces an uphill battle inbringing about his desired domestic reforms and likely will fallfrom power if he fails.   ``I think he may be gone in a couple of years,'' Vance said.   William Rogers, a secretary of state under Nixon, said Bushshould ``continue the policies of the Reagan administration. ... Ithink the prospects for peace are very good, (but) we have to remainstrong militarily.''   The former U.S. secretaries of state were here for the SixthAnnual Report from the Secretaries of State, sponsored by theAtlanta-based Southern Center for International Studies andNashville's David Lipscomb University.   They spoke with reporters before taping a two-hour televisionspecial to be broadcast by Public Broadcasting Service stationsearly next year.   There was some disagreement with Reagan. Kissinger reactedsharply to president's suggestion Thursday that there be talks withIran regarding the Lebanese hostages.   ``I am violently opposed to any negotiations about hostages,ever,'' Kissinger said. ``Once you begin negotiating on the releaseof hostages, you have indicated there is the price and the onlything left to negotiate is the price _ and therefore, hostage takinghas a reward.''   ``I know this sounds cruel, I know this is tough on the families,but I believe that devaluing hostages is the only way you canprevent hostages from being taken.''   Kissinger and Edmund Muskie, secretary of state under formerPresident Jimmy Carter, both predicted the hostages in Lebanon willbe released because it will be in Iran's interest to try to returnrelations with the United States to normal.   Vance criticized the Reagan administration's refusal to admitPalestine Liberation Organization head Yassar Arafat into the UnitedStates to address the United Nations, calling it ``a seriousmistake.''   ``It helped those who were opposed to progress in the Middle Eastand it disadvantaged those who would like to see us get the peaceprocess going ahead,'' Vance said. ``I think it makes it moredifficult for the Bush administration to act as an honest broker inthe Middle East.''   Vance said he that the United States must maintain a strongmilitary, but said, ``We must remain strong economically as well asmilitarily.''   ``I think one of the things he (Bush) is going to have to dealwith, strongly and effectively, is the twin deficits, the budgetdeficit and the trade deficit. ... What he does in regard to thatparticular issue is going to have a major effect, in the long run,on our foreign policy.''   The forum was held at the invitation of Gov. Ned McWherter, atrustee of the non-profit international studies organization.</TEXT></DOC>
