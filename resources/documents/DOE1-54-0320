Because energy isstored, pressure systems can be hazardous. Under certain circumstances,this energy can suddenly and unexpectedly be released, causing injuryto personnel and/or damage to a facility. Therefore, when planning, designing,and determining operational procedures for pressure system use, the identificationof hazards must be given the highest priority. Although the pressurevessel represents the single largest source of potential energy withina process system and its failure could be extremely catastropic, malfunctionsin system components such as piping, valves, compressors, and pumps couldalso lead to equally catastrophic failures. Therefore, operator trainingmust be thorough;it must not be cut short. Operators must develop anattitude and an awareness that is based on respect of the pressure system,and they must be aware that equipment subject to pressure must be routinelyinspected to prevent unsafe operating conditions. 7 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
