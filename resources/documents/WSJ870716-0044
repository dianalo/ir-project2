A federal grand jury in Washington issued subpoenas for records of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, its lobbyist James O. Freeman, and several Washington night spots that Messrs. Freeman and St Germain have frequented together, according to individuals familiar with the investigation. The subpoenas come just three months after Rep. St Germain, a Rhode Island Democrat, was cleared by a House Ethics Committee investigation.    The U.S. League, the largest organization representing the troubled savings-and-loan industry, confirmed receipt of a subpoena but wouldn't discuss details. &quot;The league is not the subject of the inquiry, and we're cooperating fully,&quot; said league spokesman Mark Clark. &quot;In fairness to those involved, it would be inappropriate for us to comment further at this time.&quot;    A Justice Department spokesman wouldn't comment. Rep. St Germain referred a caller to his attorney, Milton Semer, who said prosecutors hadn't notified him. Mr. Freeman also refused to comment. &quot;Since I've been in this business 20 years, I've just maintained a policy of not talking to reporters about legislation or personal matters or anything, and I think I'm going to maintain that,&quot; he said.    The Ethics Committee on April 15 issued a report that closed a 14-month investigation of Rep. St Germain's personal finances, concluding he didn't abuse his office for personal gain. It said he violated disclosure requirements by understating the true value of his assets by more than $1 million, but didn't recommend any punishment.    Although the ethics panel spent more than $300,000 to conduct the investigation, the panel's report avoided any mention of widespread reports from lobbyists and House members that Rep. St Germain regularly accepted expensive food, drink and entertainment from Mr. Freeman and other financial-industry lobbyists, a possible violation both of a House rule against taking gifts of more than $100 a year from lobbyists and of the federal anti-bribery statute, which forbids members of Congress from taking anything of value for or because of an official act.    Ethics Committee staff members did attempt to question Mr. Freeman during the investigation, but backed off when the U.S. League protested, according to people familiar with the panel's investigation. Messrs. St Germain and Freeman continued being seen together frequently in expensive watering holes, even as the ethics panel was completing its work.    House members and other lobbyists said the pair's favorite haunt was the Prime Rib restaurant, whose records the Justice Department has now subpoenaed, according to a person familiar with the investigation. The manager of the restaurant wouldn't confirm or deny receiving a subpoena. One lobbyist said St Germain openly signed for a meal for himself and some guests one night at the Prime Rib using Mr. Freeman's credit card, though Mr. Freeman wasn't present.    Mr. Freeman officially retired from the U.S. League Dec. 31, but continues to serve the organization as a paid consultant on legislative affairs, at an undisclosed rate of pay.    The investigation adds to headaches of House Democrats resulting from their close relationship with the Sandamp;L industry, whose financial troubles threaten to require a multibillion-dollar taxpayer bailout. At one point, Chairman St Germain, House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas and Majority Whip Tony Coelho of California all were siding with the Sandamp;L industry by trying to deny regulators the money and powers they requested to close hopelessly insolvent thrift institutions. Rep. Wright backed off after intense criticism for intervening with federal regulators three times on behalf of Texas Sandamp;Ls.    Earlier this month, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and Rep. Coelho's reelection committee admitted they had made frequent, unpaid use of aircraft and a 112-foot yacht operated by one of those Texas Sandamp;Ls, a possible violation of federal law prohibiting corporate campaign donations. The Democrats belatedly paid the thrift a total of $48,451.    As reported, Texas Sandamp;L executives contributed more than $100,000 to a political-action committee that mounted an independent campaign to help elect Rep. Jim Chapman in a nationally watched special election in 1985, a race in which Reps. Coelho and Wright were also deeply involved. </TEXT></DOC>
