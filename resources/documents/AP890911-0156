A Palestinian man was found beaten to death in the occupied GazaStrip and Arab reports said he was slain as an alleged collaboratorwith Israel.   The death came a day after seven Palestinians were killed byIsraelis and an eighth by a fellow Arab in one of the bloodiest daysof the 21-month-old uprising against Israeli rule.   At least 113 Palestinians have been slain by fellow Arabs asaccused collaborators, prostitutes or drug dealers and another 567have been killed by Israeli soldiers and civilians since theuprising began in December 1987. Forty Israelis have died in theviolence.   The Israeli minister, Avner Shaki, of the National ReligiousParty, spoke at a funeral for an Israeli who was bludgeoned to deathlast week, allegedly by an Arab man from the occupied West Bank.   ``To our good friend the United States, your contacts with thePLO, your regonition of the PLO and your continuing discussions withthe murderers encourages more bloodshed,'' said Shaki, a ministerwithout a portfolio. ``If you don't cease these talks, this bloodwill be on your hands.''   The U.S. began talks with the Palestine Liberation Organizationunder Israeli protest in December after the Arab group renouncedterrorism.   Meanwhile, a military governor in the disputed lands warnedPalestinians to diminish the violence or face the consequences.   Speaking on Israel's state Arabic language television, Brig. Gen.Sheike Erez, military governor of the West Bank, urged Palestinians``to stop the deterioration, because they will pay for it in theend.''   In Monday's violence, Arab hospital officials said 19Palestinians were shot and wounded in clashes with soldiers. Themost serious incident was a 17-year-old masked youth who wascritically wounded.   Arab reports said he was writing graffiti on a wall when a policeagent leaped from a car, ordered him to halt then fired when hetried to flee.   The army confirmed that security forces had shot a masked youthin Khan Yunis when he failed to halt. It also confirmed that threeother Arabs were wounded by soldiers in the West Bank and Gaza.   Elsewhere in Israel, a military court in Lod sentenced two Arabyouths to 30 years in prison for infiltrating the Egyptian borderand trying to attack an army base earlier this year.   In Jerusalem, a judge ordered a Palestinian held for 15 days onsuspicion of slaying the Jewish construction worker. The suspect isalso accused of stabbing a bus driver Saturday in an unsuccessfulattempt to force a passenger bus off the Tel Aviv-Jerusalem highwayand into a ravine.   Police refused to identify the suspect except to say he was a26-year-old man from the West Bank.   In other violence Monday, the body of Rifaat Mahmoud Hasanain,27, from Gaza City, was found in an orange grove. Arab reports saidhe was accused of spying for Israeli authorities.   The army confirmed the death but said Hasanain was killed over afamily dispute.</TEXT></DOC>
