For the year-earlier fiscal third quarter, the company reported a loss of $420,000 on revenue of $23.9 million.    Telco, a maker of fiber-optic and other communications equipment, said that as part of a restructuring program, it reduced its work force by about 80 employees. Cost reductions from the restructuring should enable the company to reach profitability by the fourth-quarter, ending Aug. 30, Telco added.    For the year-earlier fourth-quarter, the company reported a loss of $11 million on revenue of $16 million. For all of fiscal 1986, the company had a loss of $8.1 million on revenue of $89.8 million.    Telco said that to bolster its market position, it is increasing its fiber-optic sales force and plans to introduce several products during the next few months.    In national over-the-counter trading Friday, Telco closed at $3.75, up 12.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
