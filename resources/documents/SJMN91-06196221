Mulheren Jr., a formerspeculator. The court said that, because of a lack of evidence, Mulheren'sconviction &quot;defies reason.&quot;;    The setbacks do carry some serious lessons forprosecutors about the need to present their cases carefully and precisely,lawyers and other experts said. But the reversals have caused few experts todoubt that Wall Street in the 1980s was the site of criminal activity thatneeded to be cleaned up.;    With the guilty pleas of Ivan Boesky, MichaelMilken, Martin Siegel, Dennis Levine and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. oncharges ranging from insider trading to market manipulation, a secretivenetwork of powerful financiers who illegally manipulated the market for theirown advantage was exposed and dismantled.;    'Cancer on Wall Street';    &quot;Ifthey were not stopped, you would have had a cancer growing on Wall Street,&quot;said John C. Coffee Jr., a professor at Columbia University Law School. &quot;Ifyou have those kind of networks growing and in place, you are going to have acorrupt financial world.&quot;;    The investigation broke up the cozyrelationships among takeover specialists seeking to buy or sell companies, theinvestment bankers who arranged the deals, and the speculators who boughtstocks of companies in play.;    Through a system of mutual back-scratching,participants in that network made millions of dollars while disrupting some ofthe nation's largest companies.;    &quot;In the '80s, the ultimate goal of allthree groups was to put the deal together,&quot; said Ira Lee Sorkin, a formerprosecutor and former head of the New York office of the Securities andExchange Commission. &quot;And they did a lot of things that were illegal to putthe deals together.&quot;;    Fundamental changes;    The investigation of thatnetwork has led to fundamental changes on Wall Street that will have a fargreater impact than the outcome of any single case. Those changes include theadoption of stricter ethical standards, more training for employees andtougher government and internal oversight of potentially illegal activities.;   &quot;Even with these reversals, the way Wall Street does business now in 1991 isvery different from the way it did in 1986,&quot; said Gary Lynch, former head ofthe SEC's enforcement division and now a partner at the Davis, Polk andamp; Wardelllaw firm. &quot;The cases wrought enormous changes in the Wall Street ethic.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  KURT EICHENWALD, New York Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  New York  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910714  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  4E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  475  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday July 14, 199100196221,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
