While the purpose was to discuss our well-worn differences on insider trading, we met in the midst of sentencing in the Pizza Connection case. The U.S. Attorney for Manhattan had bagged the biggest drug dealers ever brought to justice, but was as gloomy as ever about the nation's drug problem.    The case against 18 drug-dealing conspirators was decided in March, with only their punishments left to come. Mr. Giuliani's office had asked for life terms for the bosses, and both the Sicilian don and the New York boss of the drug ring got 45 years, good long terms that will leave them very old when eligible for parole. Judge Pierre Laval has also levied restitution fines, so far of more than $3 million on several co-conspirators, which he says can be used to help rehabilitate the &quot;victims&quot; -- addicts who bought drugs from storefronts and restaurants. Still, it occurred to us, if the former head of the Sicilian Mafia doesn't deserve the maximum term under federal law, who does?    More revealingly, this win for the prosecution is somewhat bittersweet. There aren't many bigger dealer-fish out there to hook. Yet the lesson seems to be that the drug war cannot be won by trying to cut off supply.    Law-enforcement officials sensibly measure their success by the price of drugs on the street. If they dry up the supply, the prices rise. Heroin prices have shown some effect from the Pizza success and other dealer busts. But over the past decade the price of cocaine has actually fallen, adjusted for inflation. The supply keeps growing to meet a growing demand.    Other countries are doing what they can to solve our drug problem by limiting supplies. Colombia has lost supreme court justices to gunmen. South and Central American governments risk civil war by cracking down on the growers and, especially, on the middlemen who make the huge profits. Turkey is fighting rebels who use drugs to finance insurrection. Those countries have a point when they view the drug problem as something the U.S. inflicts on them.    If drying up the supply doesn't work, any serious anti-drug effort has to try drying up the demand. Yet drug users face an almost zero chance of arrest. Few state or federal prosecutors around the country go after users anymore. Why aren't we busting users? The experts worry about jail space, but there is a deeper problem. We may not yet have totally won the fight against the permissive drug culture of the 1960s and '70s. Cocaine remains chic partly because for years it was wrongly touted as a non-addictive drug. Cocaine doesn't require a syringe, the symbol of drug abuse and current AIDS risk, yet can be just as addictive and deadly as heroin.    We are slowly regaining the notion that individuals have an obligation to maintain minimal levels of responsibility to others, a duty that cannot be met if they are on drugs. This is obviously true of people we trust with our lives -- train conductors and airline pilots -- but is equally true for all productive citizens. So while it is a real accomplishment that the coke has been taken out of the country's pizza parlors, this is not enough. If we are to conduct a serious war on drugs, we have to think about doing something not just with importers or pushers but with users. </TEXT></DOC>
