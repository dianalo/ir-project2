 Now, when working with applicationsthat require both, systems integrators will have three implementation optionsto choose from:andM;(1) Text-retrieval packages that also have relational DBMS capability;andM;(2) RDBMSes that also sport text-retrieval functions;andM;(3) Products that merge full-featured text-retrieval systems to mainstreamRDBMS products.andM;Decisions will be made on the basis of the relative importance to theapplication of unstructured (TIMS) vs.andP;  structured (DBMS) data.andM;To bridge the technologiesandM;The fullest solutions provide an interface between full-featured datarepositories in both realms.andP;  That's what Verity Inc. of Mountain View,Calif., has done with its TOPIC/SQL-Bridge and the British vendor, KinesisComputing Ltd., offers with its Total Recall.andM;Verity's TOPIC manages a text database consisting of sets of pointers to text(and other) files in a file system and a set of indices on the files'contents.andP;  The company does not require you to store information in aproprietary format inside a Verity database.andM;SQL-Bridge interfaces between TOPIC and the most popular DBMSes, so you canmerge data stored in the relational database with text stored in TOPIC.andO;Director of marketing, Barry Goss illustrates: &quot;If you had a medical reporton a form, where the top part contained information like name, age, height,weight, address, phone number and so on--that 'structured' information wouldbe stored in a relational database.andP;  Then, on the bottom part of the form,you might have the physician's subjective evaluation of the patient's case.&quot;andO;The unstructured, or free-form, subjective data goes into TOPIC.andM;With TOPIC and its SQL-Bridge you could look into the relational database atthe form's structured information and, for example, call for the names of allmales under the age of 50 in Southern California.andP;  This query would bring upa set of pointers to text files that TOPIC could then use as an intermediateset from which to search for every case of cancer, where cancer might bedescribed in a variety of subjective criteria (e.g.andP;  growth, tumor,malignancy) within the free-form text field.andP;  The result of this two-stepprocess is a set of all under-50 males with cancer in Southern California.andM;Kinesis Computing, Swindon Wiltshire, England, developed Total Recall on BRSSearch, a text-manaement system from BRS Software Products of London.andO;Kinesis, which prides itself on being a software engineering company firstand foremost, did most of the coding necessary to integrate the BRS productto databases.andP;  Total Recall builds on the programming language interfaces inBRS.andM;Total Recall evolved from work performed for the British government.andP;  In oneproject, Kinesis developed a system for commercial attaches in Britishembassies and consulates to access information on British products availablefor export.andP;  Another application manages visa applications.andP;  Total Recallembodies the control mechanisms used in those applications and includes aquery-by-forms user interface to simplify cross-technology queries.andM;The product is written in C under UNIX and takes advantage of BRS'programming language interface.andP;  Says, Kinesis managing director GordonOlson, &quot;Basically we pipe calls and commands to and fro between two UNIXapplications, one of the applications being BRS search and the other beingthe relational database.&quot;andM;Optimized text retrievalandM;Verity's Goss contends that TOPIC's concept-based text retrieval is not onlyfaster but better than text searches based on Boolean logic (the typetraditionally supported in RDBMSes).andP;  Claims Goss, &quot;Boolean systems attain a20 percent to 25 percent accuracy rating.andP;  With TOPIC, we can improve that byat least a factor of 2, and in most cases by a factor of 4 or 5.&quot;andM;A concept-based retrieval mechanism permits the text-management system tobreak away from Boolean queries that might read, &quot;Show me all the documentswith this word and that word, but not with this other word within 10 words ofeither of the first two words.&quot;andP;  Instead, the concept-based retrievalmechanism is based on what Verity coincidentally calls &quot;topics,c where topicshas three properties--structure, weight and operators.andP;  By assigning weightsto terms the user is searching for, TOPIC can return a list of documents inrelevance-based order.andM;Text-manaement products also are optimized for the way users must interactwith them.andP;  Michael McDonald, vice president for product planning and supportat Information Dimensions Inc. in Dublin, Ohio, outlines a customary usersession: &quot;Typically, with a system like our BASISplus users first enter theirsearch criteria.andP;  When they get a set of documents back, they look throughthem.andP;  But they are interested only in reading pieces of the document--notnecessarily retireving the whole document.andP;  It may be very long.andP;  The userwill want to go directly to the parts of the document where the searchphrases occur.andP;  Then they might want to scroll around within the documentbefore deciding if it is interesting or not.&quot;andM;If it is, the user puts it aside for the moment and looks at the remainingdocuments in the selected set.andP;  If it's not, the user discards it.andP;  After thescreening is complete, the user goes back to study the documents deemedinteresting.andM;Text-management systems might also let you link a graphic image or a notationto a document.andP;  Example: Verity's TOPIC-Realtime product, which takesinformation directly from a live news wire and sends it to interested usersvia electronic mail based on their particular interest profiles.andM;Where TIMS differs from DBMSandM;Text-retrieval systems do more than simply provide for storage andmanagement.andP;  They also offer you the tools to perform searches on sets oftext files, where the tools respond to the way users search for a document,scan its contents and build a result set as part of a highly interactivesession with the text system.andM;The basic architecture of high-performance text systems must be tuned to theunique needs of the text application.andP;  For example, text systems requiredifferent types of indices so you can move backward and forward through adocument.andP;  The systems must offer a different set of query operators, like&quot;include&quot; and &quot;within&quot; with which you ask for files by a certain word withinso many words of another.andP;  And the systems must understand the links betweenfiles that make up a compound document.andM;Information Dimensions, which has offered both text-retrieval and DBMSsoftware for a number of years, has recently merged the two technologies inone product called BASISplus.andP;  Here the relational database serves as theunderlying platform for the text-retrieval system.andP;  The effort was quiteinvolved.andM;In modifying its DBMS architecture for text support, the company added anumber of extensions.andP;  McDonald explains: &quot;Documents have chapters, chaptershave sections, and people like to use the table of contents.andP;  We had to dealwith these as part of this fundamental document within the system.andP;  So thisdocument is really sort of a complex of relational records that can be dealtwith as a unit by the programmer, who needn't worry about how to join onepiece to the next in order to move through it.andP;  Nor does the programer needto worry about how to move around from the table of contents.andP;  We also feltthat, if yo1hve got a large text record, it's not practical to pass all thatback--it's more like a file.andP;  We pass back only a chunk of the record at atime.&quot;andM;Informix Corp. of Menlo Park, Calif., promises text-retrieval functionsthrough SQL in an upcoming release of its RDBMS.andM;Best of both worldsandM;But as text-retrieval and DBMS publishers offer portions of the each other'stechnologies, application developers who demand leading-edge support fromboth product classes still must do some coding.andP;  To their credit, most of thetext systems offer some form of exits, or programming-language hooks, to letapplication programs call the text-management functions.andM;Mike Muth, manager of product marketing at Info Data Systems in Fall Church,Va., says his company's Inquire/Text offers a programming interface to PL/1,COBOL, FORTRAN and assembler.andP;  And Information Dimensions' BASISplus productincludes FORTRAN and COBOL precompiler modules with which developers embeddata-manipulation language statements in FORTRAN or COBOL code.andP;  InformationDimensions is also planning to put hooks in its BASISplus to make it possibleto access other vendors' SQL databases.andM;Tools like Total Recall may be the best way to merge repositories ofstructured and unstructured data.andP;  Certainly, it is more reasonable to expectcompanies who specialize in text retrieval to try harder than an RDBMSpublisher to stay on the leading edge of text-management.andP;  Conversely, itseems likely that a company like Informix will be more likely to remain farahead of text companies when it comes to RDMS innovation.andP;  Bridges, buildingon established programming-language interfaces, may be the optimal solution.andM;However, the approach Informix has adopted in providing support for BLOBfields may provide an avenue for text-retrieval publishers to mesh theirtechnologies with those of the RDBMS world.andP;  As reviewed in last month'sDBMS/REPORT, many DBMSes offer or promise support for BLOBs (fields of almostany length that store amorphous masses of binary data, graphics or text).andO;With BLOBs, RDBMSes provide a repository for text, but most offer no realsupport for search and retrieval.andP;  Such data manipulation is left to theapplication developer.andM;Informix product manager Tim Shetler says: &quot;We've done some things with BLOBsthat may make it easier for companies like Verity to integrate into ourdatabase and still have us store the text as BLOBs.andP;  We recognize that mostof the BLOBs on databases today are, for the most part, in files.andP;  It seemsreasonable to permit those files to be added to our database fairly easily.andO;Similarly those files were created by graphics programs and word processorsand so forth that all work on the concept of a file.andP;  To allow these tools tocontinue to work on those same BLOBs, we have to be able to not only import afile into our database but also to export a BLOB out of our database into afile.andM;&quot;We provide a four- or five-field structure.andP;  A programmer using BLOBsinitializes those fields to indicate where a BLOB they are adding to thedatabase is coming from.andP;  That may be directly from a program via memory orthey might simply want to pick up the file--whether it be a word processingdocument or a spreadsheet or a graph or something that was created by anotherproduct.&quot;andM;If the BLOB comes from a file, the file's name will also be stored in thestructure.andP;  Then, when the user performs a SQL insert into a table thatcontains a BLOB call, the insert will retrieve the BLOB from that file andinsert it into the database record.andP;  A similar process can be used to exportthe file.andM;Ron Carnahan is a senior management consultant with JYACC Inc., a New Yorkcompany providing management and technical consulting services as well as aline of application development tools.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
