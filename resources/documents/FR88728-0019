Specifically, the interim rule amendsthe regulations to reflect two basic changes effected by the new statute:(1) Extension of the civil penalty provisions of the federal railroad safetystatutes to individuals, which makes them liable for civil penalties forwillful violations; and (2) increase of the maximum civil penalty for violationof the rail safety statutes and regulations from $2,500 to $10,000, and,under certain circumstances, up to $20,000. FRA also issues interim statementsof policy amending the penalty schedules appended to its regulations toreflect the statutory changes and a general statement of policy explainingits interim policy on exercising its expanded enforcement authority. FRAwill subsequently issue final statements of policy making itemized, line-by-linechanges to its penalty schedules to reflect the higher maximum penaltiesnow available. To the extent that amendments to the interim rule appearnecessary, a final rule making those changes will also be issued at thattime.

L. No. 100-342),enacted on June 22, 1988, made many basic changes, two of which are pertinenthere, to the federal railroad safety statutes. (Those statutes includethe Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970, 45 U.S.C. 421 <T3>et seq.,</T3> and a group of statutes enacted prior to 1970 referredto collectively herein as the ``older laws'': the Safety Appliance Acts,45 U.S.C. 1-16; the Locomotive Inspection Act, 45 U.S.C. 22-34; the AccidentReports Act, 45 U.S.C. 38-43; the Hours of Service Act, 45 U.S.C. 61-64a;and the Signal Inspection Act, 49 App. U.S.C. 26.)The first relevant change brought about by the RSIA was the amendment ofthe safety statutes to authorize the assessment of civil penalties againstindividuals who willfully violate the rail safety statutes or regulations,and to permit the Federal Railroad Administration to suspend or disqualifyan individual whose violation of the safety laws is shown to make thatindividual unfit for performance of safety-sensitive functions in the railindustry. (Only the civil penalty aspects of this change are addressedhere.)Second, the RSIA raised the maximum civil penalty that FRA may access underthe safety laws. Under the Hours of Service Act, the penalty was changedfrom a flat $500 to a penalty of ``up to $1,000, as the Secretary of Transportationdeems reasonable.'' Under all the other statutes, the maximum penalty wasraised from $2,500 to $10,000 per violation, except that, ``where a grosslynegligent violation or pattern of repeated violations has created an imminenthazard of death or injury to persons, or has caused death or injury,''a penalty of up to $20,000 per violation may now be assessed.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Need To Conform The Regulations To The Amended Statutes</ITAG>Most of the federal railroad safety laws are not self-actuating; rather,they have been implemented through extensive rulemaking. The Hours of ServiceAct is the major exception; it includes substantive provisions that canbe directly violated; accordingly, except for the few areas under thatstatute that authorize FRA to issue rules, FRA's enforcement of the Hoursof Service Act entails assessment of penalties for violations to the statuteitself. Thus, the amendments to nearly all the substantive provisions ofthe Hours of Service Act became enforceable on the date of the RSIA wasenacted (i.e., June 22, 1988).However, under the other safety statutes, which provide broad rulemakingauthority, FRA has generally issued implementing regulations that bearthe jurisdictional and maximum penalty limitations of the statutes as theyexisted at the time the regulations were issued. For example, the penaltyand responsibility sections of the regulations do not address the liabilityof individuals. Also, most of the regulations include a schedule of civilpenalties that indicates what specific penalty FRA will initially assessfor the violation of a particular regulation. Those schedules reflect the$2,500 maximum in existence when they were issued and apply on their faceonly to railroads.Arguably, the regulations automatically became applicable to individuals,and the increased maximum penalties immediately became available for use,on the date the RSIA was enacted. However, it is also arguable that, inorder to provide adequate notice of duties and liabilities to those subjectto the regulations, they should be revised to conform to the amended statutes.FRA believes it is important that the regulations match the new statutoryauthority before any attempt is made to apply the higher penalties or penalizeindividuals. Congress recognized the need to amend the regulations andschedules and required that the changes be made promptly. Section 3(b)of the RSIA provides:<ITAG tagnum="21">Within 30 days after enactment of this Act the Secretary of Transportation* * * shall issue interim rules, regulations, orders, or standards containingpenalty schedules applicable to railroads and individuals reflecting thechanges made by the amendments in subsection (a). The Seretary shall issuefinal rules, regulations, orders, or standards with respect to such penaltyschedules within six months after such date of enactment.</ITAG>Thus, in order for FRA to effectively enforce the rail safety regulationsand carry out the legislative mandate, it needs to make these technicalamendments to the regulations and revise the penalty schedules to conformthem to the recent amendments to the statutes under which they were issued.Because these amendments do no more than mirror statutory changes, noticeand comment procedures are ``impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary tothe public interest'' within the meaning of section 4(a)(3)(B) of the AdministrativeProcedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B). Given the obvious Congressional intentto require prompt implementation of the RSIA provisions authorizing higherpenalties and sanctions against individuals, any delay necessitated bynotice and comment procedures would be contrary to the public interest.Moreover, public comment is unnecessary because, in making these technicalamendments to give effect to the new statute, FRA is not exercising discretionin a way that could be informed by public comment. That is, FRA's choiceshere are linguistic, not substantive. Accordingly, FRA proceeds directlyto an interim rule. For similar reasons, there is good cause for not publishingthis rule at least 30 days before its effective date, as is ordinarilyrequired by 5 U.S.C. 553(d). All interested parties have had notice ofthe relevant provisions of the RSIA since its enactment on June 22, 1988,more than 30 days prior to the effective date of this rule (August 1, 1988).There is, in addition to the reasons just stated, another reason why noticeand comment procedures are also unnecessary with regard to the revisionsto the penalty schedules and interim statement of policy issued by thisnotice. The schedules themselves are statements of agency policy that,like the general statement of policy, are excepted from notice and commentprocedure by virtue of 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(A). Moreover, in reporting outthe bill that was enacted as the RSIA, the conference committee stated:``The conferees view these penalty schedules as a matter committed to agencydiscretion by law.'' H. Rep. No. 100-637, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. at 21 (1988).<ITAG tagnum="84">Effect of This Interim Rule and Policy Statement</ITAG>This Notice amends the text of the railroad safety regulations (eighteenseparate parts are amended here) to conform them to the RSIA in terms ofsanctions against individuals and increased maximum penalties. Currently,the regulations contain sections (variously labeled ``Civil penalty,''``Prohibited acts,'' ``Application,'' ``Responsibility,'' or ``Definitions'')that limit the reach of the regulatory parts in which they appear to railroadsand restrict the penalties that may be assessed to the former maximum of$2,500. These regulatory changes are made in the form of an interim rule,as required by section 3(a) of the RSIA. Although notice and opportunityfor comment are not required, FRA will review any comments received and,at the time it issues final penalty schedules (see below), issue any necessarychanges to its interim rule. Except as modified in response to those comments,this interim rule will become final at that time.This notice also amends the penalty schedules appended to most of the railroadsafety regulations. Those schedules are statements of agency policy thatspecify the civil penalty that FRA will ordinarily assess for the violationof a particular regulation and reserve FRA's right to assess a penaltyup to the statutory maximum where circumstances warrant. The rail safetystatutes, of course, authorize FRA to compromise the penalty initiallyassessed after considering any defenses and a wide variety of mitigatingfactors. Accordingly, the penalty actually collected may range from the$250 minimum set by the safety statutes to the amount initially assessed(and, where a valid defense is shown to exist during negotiations, no amountat all would be collected). Nevertheless, the schedules provide membersof the regulated community with some idea of the amount they are likelyto be assessed for a given violation.Given the complexity of amending the hundreds of individual entries inFRA's penalty schedules, combined with the desire to promptly give effectto the expanded authority granted by the RSIA, Congress required that thepenalty schedules be amended in a two-stage process. Section 3(b) of theRSIA requires FRA to issue interim penalty schedules within 30 days ofenactment and final penalty schedules within six months of enactment. Thechanges effected by this notice constitute the interim penalty schedulesdiscussed in section 3(b). These interim schedules simply reserve FRA'sright to assess a penalty up to $20,000 in appropriate circumstances, standardizeterminology so that all schedules will contain entries for normal and willfulviolations under each regulation, and make clear that the penalties inthe column headed ``willful'' may be assessed against all persons, includingindividuals. Thus, under this interim system, the initial penalty assessedfor a willful violation would be the same regardless of whether the violatorwas a railroad or an individual.Over the next several months, FRA will amend the schedules line by lineand issue final schedules within six months of enactment. Notice and commentprocedure is not required on such a statement of policy, but interestedparties are welcome to submit their views; all comments received priorto publication will be considered. One issue commenters may want to addressis whether separate penalty schedules for individuals are appropriate.Commenters should keep in mind that the schedules contain only initialassessment amounts. The final penalty ultimately collected will dependon the defenses or mitigating factors raised by the alleged violator duringinformal negotiations with FRA (or, if the alleged violator chooses tolitigate, on what the court thinks of any defenses or mitigating factors).Third, this notice issues as an appendix to Part 209 an Interim Statementof Policy that generically addresses what FRA's policy will be in exercisingits new authority to collect penalties from individuals and in assessingthe higher maximum penalties. This interim statement covers FRA's definitionof ``willful'' and explains the informal procedures FRA will use to assesspenalties and negotiate final penalty amounts with individuals. This statementalso contains a useful summary of FRA's overall civil penalty enforcementprocess. All those interested in that process are urged to become familiarwith the statement. When FRA issues its final penalty schedules, it willalso issue a final statement of policy.Finally, this notice makes certain editorial changes to the text of regulationsthat are being amended. For example, in 49 CFR 225.5, the definition of``railroad'' is amended to comport with that in the Federal Railroad SafetyAct of 1970, which makes clear that self-contained urban rapid transitsystems are not included. In Part 228, interim rules on construction ofemployee sleeping quarters are eliminated; they were replaced by finalrules (49 CFR Part 228, Subpart C) issued in 1978 but, inadvertently, werenot removed at that time. These editorial changes have no effect on thesubstantive authority of the agency.This notice does not amend the regulations to provide penalties for tamperingwith certain safety devices, a subject on which section 21 of the RSIArequires FRA to issue rules, as may be necessary, within 90 days of enactment.That subject will be dealt with in a separate proceeding. Nor does thisnotice issue procedural regulations for exercise of the authority, providedby section 3(a) of the RSIA, to suspend or disqualify an individual fromsafety-sensitive functions. In another proceeding, FRA will amend Part209 of 49 CFR to include such procedures. Until final publication of thoseprocedures, FRA will not act to suspend or disqualify an individual unlesscircumstances warrant use of its emergency order authority under 45 U.S.C.432.<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Participation</ITAG>For the reasons discussed above, notice and public participation are notrequired here. However, the public is invited to submit comments by September15, 1988. All comments received by that date will be considered in draftingFRA's final rule, penalty schedules, and general statement of policy. Commentsreceived after that date will be considered to the extent possible withoutincurring additional delay or expense.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Impact</ITAG>E.O. 12291 and DOT Regulatory Policies and ProceduresThis interim rule and policy statement have been evaluated in accordancewith existing policies and procedures. They are considered to be non-majorunder Executive Order 12291. Because of the substantial public interestassociated with issuance of this interim rule, it is considered significantunder the DOT policies and procedures. (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979.)This rule will not have any direct or indirect economic impact becauseit does not alter any existing substantive or procedural regulation insuch a way as to impose additional burdens. The cost of complying withexisting substantive regulations is not being increased. The rule merelycontains a regulatory formulation of FRA's amended statutory authorityand a statement of its enforcement policy in the event of noncompliance.Accordingly, preparation of a regulatory evaluation is not warranted.Regulatory Flexibility ActFRA certifies that this interim rule will not have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities. There are no direct orindirect economic impacts for small units of government, businesses, orother organizations. State rail agencies remain free to participate inthe administration of FRA's rules but are not required to do so.Paperwork Reduction ActThere are no information collection requirements contained in this interimrule and policy statement.Environmental ImpactFRA has evaluated this interim rule and policy statement in accordancewith its procedures for ensuring full consideration of the potential environmentalimpacts of FRA actions, as required by the National Environmental PolicyAct and related directives. This notice meets the criteria that establishthis as a non-major action for environmental purposes. Federalism Implications This interim rule and statement of policy will not have a substantial effecton the states, on the relationship between the national government andthe states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Thus, in accordance with Executive Order12612, preparation of a Federalism Assessment is not warranted. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 49 CFR Parts 209, 213-236 </ITAG>Railroad safety, Penalties.

Appendix A is revised to read as follows: <ITAG tagnum="84">Appendix A_Interim Statement of Agency Policy Concerning Civil PenaltiesAssessed Under the Federal Railroad Safety Laws </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Rail Safety Improvement Act of 1988 (Pub. L. No. 100-342, enactedJune 22, 1988) (``RSIA'') raised the maximum civil penalties availableunder the railroad safety laws and made individuals liable for willfulviolations of those laws. Those statutes include the Federal Railroad SafetyAct of 1970 (``Safety Act''), 45 U.S.C. 421 <T3>et seq.,</T3> and a group of statutes enacted prior to 1970 referredto collectively herein as the ``older laws'': The Safety Appliance Acts,45 U.S.C. 1-16; the Locomotive Inspection Act, 45 U.S.C. 22-34; the AccidentReports Act, 45 U.S.C. 38-43; the Hours of Service Act, 45 U.S.C. 61-64a;and the Signal Inspection Act, 49 App. U.S.C. 26. Regulations implementingthose statutes are found at 49 CFR Parts 213 through 236. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Especially because of the introduction of penalties against individuals,FRA's enforcement of the rail safety laws has entered a new era. The changesare so significant that FRA believes it is necessary to set forth the mannerin which it intends to exercise the new authority. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">The Civil Penalty Process </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Understanding how FRA has exercised its civil penalty authority upto this point is helpful in understanding how it intends to implement itsnew authority. The front lines in the civil penalty process are the FRAsafety inspectors: FRA employs 325 inspectors, and their work is supplementedby approximately 100 inspectors from states participating in enforcementof the federal rail safety laws. These inspectors routinely inspect theequipment, track, and signal systems and observe the operations of thenation's railroads. They also investigate hundreds of complaints filedannually by those alleging noncompliance with the laws. When inspectionor complaint investigation reveals noncompliance with the laws, each noncomplyingcondition or action is listed on an inspection report. Where the inspectordetermines that the best method of promoting compliance is to assess acivil penalty, he or she prepares a violation report, which is essentiallya recommendation to the FRA Office of Chief Counsel to assess a penaltybased on the evidence provided in or with the report. In determining whichinstances of noncompliance merit penalty recommendations, the inspectorlooks at such factors as the inherent seriousness of the condition or actionand the railroad's general history of compliance with the set of regulationsinvolved, especially at the specific location or division of the railroadinvolved. The exercise of this discretion at the field level is a vitalpart of the enforcement process, ensuring that the exacting and time consumingcivil penalty process is used to address those situations most in needof the deterrent effect of penalties. FRA intends to exercise that discretionwith regard to individual violators in the same manner it has with respectto railroads. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Office of Chief Counsel's Safety Division reviews each violationreport for legal sufficiency and assesses penalties based on those allegationsthat survive that review. Historically, the Division has returned lessthan five percent of the reports submitted in a given year, often witha request for further work and resubmission. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Penalties are assessed by issuance of a penalty demand letter thatsummarizes the claims, encloses the violation report with a copy of allevidence on which FRA is relying in making its initial charge, and explainsthat the railroad may pay in full or submit, orally or in writing, informationconcerning any defenses or mitigating factors. The railroad safety statutes,in conjunction with the Federal Claims Collection Act, authorize FRA tocompromise the initial penalty claims based on a wide variety of mitigatingfactors. This system permits the efficient collection of civil penaltiesin amounts that fit the actual offense without resort to time-consumingand expensive litigation. Over its history, FRA has had to request thatthe Attorney General bring suit to collect a penalty on only a very fewoccasions. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Once penalties have been assessed, the railroad is given a reasonbleamount of time to investigate the charges. Larger railroads usually maketheir case before FRA in an informal settlement conference covering a numberof case files that have been issued and investigated since the previousconference. Thus, in terms of the negotiating time of both sides, economiesof scale are achieved that would be impossible if each case were negotiatedseparately. The settlement conferences, held either in Washington or anothermutually agreed on location, include technical experts from both FRA andthe railroad as well as lawyers for both parties. In addition to allowingthe two sides to make their cases for the relative merits of the variousclaims, these conferences also provide a forum for addressing current complianceproblems. Smaller railroads usually prefer to handle negotiations throughthe mail or over the phone, often on a single case at a time. Once thetwo sides have agreed to a compromise amount on each case, that agreementis put in writing and a check is submitted to FRA's accounting divisioncovering the full amount agreed on. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Cases brought under the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act, 49App. U.S.C. 1801 <T3>et seq.,</T3> are, due to certain statutory requirements, handled undermore formal administrative procedures. <T3>See</T3> 49 CFR Part 209, Subpart B. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Civil Penalties Against Individuals </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The RSIA amended the penalty provisions of the railroad safety statutesto make them applicable to any ``person (including a railroad and any manager,supervisor, official, or agent of a railroad)'' who fails to comply withthe regulations or statutes. <T3>E.g.,</T3> section 3 of the RSIA, amending section 209 of the SafetyAct. However, the RSIA also provided that civil penalties may be assessedagainst individuals ``only for willful violations.'' </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Thus, any individual meeting the statutory description of ``person''is liable for a civil penalty for a willful violation of the safety statutesor regulations. As the regulations are generally written to impose requirementson railroads, they are being amended simultaneously with the issuance ofthis statement to make clear that any individual who willfully violatesthe regulatory requirements, or who willfully causes the violation of thoserequirements, may be held liable for a civil penalty. Of course, as hastraditionally been the case with respect to acts of noncompliance by railroads,the FRA field inspector will exercise discretion in deciding which situationscall for a civil penalty assessment as the best method of ensuring compliance.The inspector has a range of options, including an informal warning, amore formal warning letter issued by the Safety Division of the Officeof Chief Counsel, recommendation of a civil penalty assessment, recommendationof disqualification or suspension from safety-sensitive service, or, underthe most extreme circumstances, recommendation of emergency action. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The threshold question in any alleged violation by an individual willbe whether that violation was ``willful.'' (Note that section 3(a) of theRSIA, which authorizes suspension or disqualification of a person whoseviolation of the safety laws has shown him or her to be unfit for safety-sensitiveservice, does not require a showing of willfulness. Separate regulationsimplementing that provision will be issued by FRA). FRA proposed this standardof liability when, in 1987, it originally proposed a statutory revisionauthorizing civil penalties against individuals. FRA believed then andstill believes that it would be too harsh a system to collect fines fromindividuals on a strict liability basis, as the safety statutes permitFRA to do with respect to railroads. FRA also believed that even a negligencestandard (<T3>e.g.,</T3> the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act's standard forcivil penalty liability, 49 U.S.C. 1809(a)) would subject individuals tocivil penalties in more situations than the current record warrants. Instead,FRA wanted the authority to penalize those who violate the safety lawsthrough a purposeful act of free will rather than a mere failure to exercisereasonable care. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Thus, FRA will consider a ``willful'' violation to be one that isan intentional, voluntary act committed either with knowledge of the relevantlaw or reckless disregard for whether the act violated the requirementsof the law. Accordingly, neither a showing of evil purpose (as is sometimesrequired in certain criminal cases) nor actual knowledge of the law isnecessary to prove a willful violation, but a level of culpability higherthan negligence must be demonstrated. <T3>See Trans World Airlines, Inc. </T3>v. <T3>Thurston,</T3> 469 U.S. 111 (1985); <T3>Brock </T3>v. <T3>Morello Bros. Constr., Inc.,</T3> 809 F.2d 161 (1st Cir. 1987); and<T3>Donovan </T3>v. <T3>Williams Enterprises, Inc.,</T3> 744 F.2d 170 (D.C. Cir. 1984). A willfulviolation entails knowledge of the facts constituting the violation, butactual, subjective knowledge need not be demonstrated. It will sufficeto show objectively what the alleged violator must have known of the factsbased on reasonable inferences drawn from the circumstances. For example,a person shown to have been responsible for performing an initial terminalair brake test that was not in fact performed would not be able to defendagainst a charge of a willful violation simply by claiming subjective ignoranceof the fact that the test was not performed. If the facts, taken as a whole,demonstrated that the person was responsible for doing the test and hadno reason to believe it was performed by others, and if that person wasshown to have acted with actual knowledge of or reckless disregard forthe law requiring such a test, he or she would be subject to a cviil penalty.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This definition of ``willful'' fits squarely within the parametersfor willful acts laid out by Congress in the RSIA and its legislative history.Section 3(a) of the RSIA amends the Safety Act to provide:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For purposes of this section, an individual shall be deemed not tohave committed a willful violation where such individual has acted pursuantto the direct order of a railroad official or supervisor, under protestcommunicated to the supervisor. Such individual shall have the right todocument such protest.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">As FRA made clear when it recommended individual penalty authority,a railroad employee should not have to choose between liability for a civilpenalty or insubordination charges by the railroad. Where an employee (oreven a supervisor) violates the law under a direct order from a supervisor,he or she does not do so of his or her free will. Thus, the act is nota voluntary one and, therefore, not willful under FRA's definition of theword. Instead, the action of the person who has directly ordered the commissionof the violation is itself a willful violation subjecting that person toa civil penalty. As one of the primary sponsors of the RSIA said on theSenate floor:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This amendment also seeks to clarify that the purpose of imposingcivil penalties against individuals is to deter those who, of their freewill, decide to violate the safety laws. The purpose is not to penalizethose who are ordered to commit violations by those above them in the railroadchain of command. Rather, in such cases, the railroad official or supervisorwho orders the others to violate the law would be liable for any violationshis order caused to occur. One example is the movement of railroad carsor locomotives that are actually known to contain certain defective conditions.A train crew member who was ordered to move such equipment would not beliable for a civil penalty, and his participation in such movements couldnot be used against him in any disqualification proceeding brought by FRA.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">133 Cong. Rec. S.15899 (daily ed. Nov. 5, 1987) (remarks of SenatorExon). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">It should be noted that FRA will apply the same definition of ``willful''to corporate acts as is set out here with regard to individual violations.Although railroads are strictly liable for violations of the railroad safetylaws and deemed to have knowledge of those laws, FRA's penalty schedulescontain, for each regulation, a separate amount earmarked as the initialassessment for willful violations. Where FRA seeks such an extraordinarypenalty from a railroad, it will apply the definition of ``willful'' setforth above. In such cases_as in all civil penalty cases brought by FRA_theaggregate knowledge and actions of the railroad's managers, supervisors,employees, and other agents will be imputed to the railroad. Thus, in situationsthat FRA decides warrant a civil penalty based on a willful violation,FRA will have the option of citing the railroad and/or one or more of theindividuals involved. In cases against railroads other than those in whichFRA alleges willfulness, the principles of strict liability and presumedknowledge of the law will continue to apply. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The RSIA gives individuals the right to protest a direct order toviolate the law and to document the protest. FRA will consider such protestsand supporting documentation in deciding whether and against whom to citecivil penalties in a particular situation. Where such a protest is shownto have been communicated to the supervisor, the person or persons communicatingit will have demonstrated their lack of willfulness. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">However, the absence of such a protest will not be viewed as warrantinga presumption of willfulness on the part of the employee who might havecommunicated it. The statute says that a person who communicates such aprotest shall be deemed not to have acted willfully; it does not say thata person who does not communicate such a protest will be deemed to haveacted willfully. FRA would have to prove from all the pertinent facts thatthe employee willfully violated the law. Moreover, the absence of a protestwould not be dispositive with regard to the willfulness of a supervisorwho issued a direct order to violate the law. That is, the supervisor whoallegedly issued an order to violate will not be able to rely on the employee'sfailure to protest the order as a complete defense. Rather, the issue willbe whether, in view of all pertinent facts, the supervisor intentionallyand voluntarily ordered the employee to commit an act that the supervisorknew would violate the law or acted with reckless disregard for whetherit violated the law. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">FRA intends to exercise the civil penalty authority over individualsthrough informal procedures very similar to those used with respect torailroad violations. However, FRA will vary those procedures somewhat toaccount for differences that may exist between the railroad's ability todefend itself against a civil penalty charge and an individual's abilityto do so. First, when the field inspector decides that an individual'sactions warrant a civil penalty recommendation and drafts a violation report,the inspector will inform the individual in writing of his or her intentionto seek assessment of a civil penalty and the fact that a violation reporthas been transmitted to the Office of Chief Counsel. This will ensure thatthe individual has the opportunity to seek counsel, preserve documents,or take any other necessary steps to aid his or her defense at the earliestpossible time. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Second, if the Office of Chief Counsel concludes that the case ismeritorious and issues a penalty demand letter, that letter will make clearthat FRA encourages discussion, through the mail, over the phone or inperson, of any defenses or mitigating factors the individual may wish toraise. That letter will also advise the individual that he or she may wishto obtain representation by an attorney and/or labor representative. Duringthe negotiation stage, FRA will consider each case individually on itsmerits and give due weight to whatever information the alleged violaterprovides.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Finally, in the unlikely event that a compromise cannot be reached,FRA will send the individual a letter warning of its intention to requestthat the Attorney General sue for the initially proposed amount and givingthe person a sufficient interval (e.g., 30 to 90 days) to decide if thatis the only alternative. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">FRA believes that the intent of Congress would be violated if individualswho agree to pay a civil penalty or are ordered to do so by a court areindemnified for that penalty by the railroad or another institution (suchas a labor organization). Congress intended that the penalties have a deterrenteffect on individual behavior that would be lessened, if not eliminated,by such indemnification. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Although informal, face-to-face meetings are encouraged during thenegotiation of a civil penalty charge, the RSIA does not require that FRAgive individuals or railroads the opportunity for a formal, trial-typeadministrative hearing as part of the civil penalty process. FRA does notintend to provide that opportunity because such administrative hearingswould be likely to add significantly to the costs an individual would haveto bear in defense of a safety claim (and also to FRA's enforcement expenses)without shedding any more light on what resolution of the matter is fairthan would the informal procedures set forth here. Of course, should anindividual or railroad decide to litigate FRA's charges, that person wouldbe entitled to a trial <T3>de novo </T3>in the appropriate United States district court. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Assessment of Maximum Penalties </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As recommended by the Department of Transportation in its initialproposal for rail safety legislative revisions in 1987, the RSIA raisedthe maximum civil penalties for violations of the safety regulations. Underthe Hours of Service Act, the penalty was changed from a flat $500 to apenalty of ``up to $1,000, as the Secretary of Transportation deems reasonable.''Under all the other statutes, the maximum penalty was raised from $2,500to $10,000 per violation, except that, ``where a grossly negligent violationor pattern of repeated violations has created an imminent hazard of deathor injury to persons, or has caused death or injury,'' a penalty of upto $20,000 per violation may now be assessed. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">FRA's traditional practice has been to issue penalty schedules assigningto each particular regulation specific dollar amounts for initial penaltyassessments. For each regulation, the schedule shows two amounts in separatecolumns, the first for ordinary violations and the second for intentionalor hazardous violations. Under each of the schedules, however, FRA hasreserved the right, usually in a footnote, to assess the statutory maximumpenalty for any especially serious violation regardless of the fact thata lesser amount might be shown in both columns of the schedule. For example,the penalty schedule for the Track Safety Standards has, for many years,listed a penalty of $750 for an ordinary violation of andSection; 213.53(track gage), a penalty of $1,500 for a hazardous violation of that section,and reserved the right to assess the maximum penalty. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Thus, the schedule amounts are meant to provide guidance as to FRA'spolicy in ordinary situations, not to bind FRA from using the full rangeof penalty authority where extraordinary circumstances warrant. FRA willuse this same principle in implementing the higher penalties provided forby the RSIA, as Congress intended. The Senate report on the bill that becamethe RSIA stated:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">``It is expected that the Secretary would act expeditiously to setpenalty levels commensurate with the severity of the violations, with impositionof the maximum penalty reserved for violation of any regulation where warrantedby exceptional circumstances.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">S. Rep. No. 100-153, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. 8 (1987).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">FRA will amend its penalty schedules to list initial assessment amountswithin the range of $250 to $10,000. In the meantime, however, FRA expresslyreserves the right to assess a penalty of up to $10,000 for any particularviolation where warranted by exceptional circumstances. Moreover, althoughFRA will not amend its schedules to show any penalty amount above $10,000,it also reserves the right to assess a penalty of up to $20,000 per violationwhere a grossly negligent violation or a pattern of repeated violationshas created an imminent hazard of death or injury to persons, or has causeddeath or injury. This authority to assess a penalty for a single violationabove $10,000 and up to $20,000 is expected to be used only in very exceptionalcases to penalize egregious behavior. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Thus, although FRA is not amending the hundreds of line items in itspenalty schedules at this time, it reserves the right to use the new maximumpenalties provided for by the RSIA from the effective date of this policystatement (August 1, 1988). Where FRA avails itself of this right to usethe higher penalties in place of the schedule amount it will so indicatein its penalty demand letter. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">PART 213_[AMENDED] </ITAG>2.
