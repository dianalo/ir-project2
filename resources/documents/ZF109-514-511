 Archaeologists havediscovered warehouses full of dinner-roll-shaped clay invoices and bills ofsale from diggings in ancient Babylonia, representing a 5000-year recordretention.andM;Image as a form of computer data is new to most computer installations.andP;  Thispaper presents an introduction to image technology and briefly discusses someof the effects it has on computer systems.andP;  The focus in this paper is onimage as it applies to business applications.andP;  First, the concept of image isintroduced.andP;  This is followed by an introduction to the use of image inbusiness.andM;An image is a collection of picture elements that transform the originalpicture into an electronic image.andP;  Picture elements are analogous to thetesserae of which a mosaic is composed.andP;  Another way of thinking of image isthat a digital image is a page of numbers usually arrayed as a matrix,wherein the position of the number represents the position of the pictureelements, and the value represents its brightness or amplitude.andP;  The positionof each picture element is its location within a grid pattern, as expressedby the two coordinates x and y.andP;  An array of picture elements is shown inFigure 1.andP;  The picture elements are also known as pixels or pels.andM;Each element of an image can have only one discrete numberic position andbrightness value.andP;  Thus we call the image a digital image.andP;  The picture on acomputer display is composed of these picture elements.andP;  The eyes cannotresolve the square or circular picture elements from a distance, but closeexamination of the display revelas these image building blocks.andP;  Thesecircles or squares are the visual manifestation of the picture elements,which shortened form the word pixel.andP;  Pixel, in turn, became pel because somolder computer languages required the names of variables to be less than fivecharacters long.andP;  Although some people have noted differences, they are notcommonly accepted.andP;  Thus, all three terms--picture element, pixel, andpel--are interchangeable in this paper.andP;  Another term often used for pixel is&quot;dot.&quot;andP;  Dot however, is reserved for use with printer pels.andM;The way an image is built up by a series of rows of pixels is also calledraster format, a term that comes down to us from the scanning pattern of thecathoderay tube.andP;  Raster also refers to the pattern of scan lines thatconstitute a television display; these are drawn by an electron beam as anarray of closely spaced parallel lines called raster lines.andM;Historical background.andP;  One of the first uses of digital image was theBartlane Cable Picture Transmission System introduced in the early 1920s.andO;This system connected London, England, with New York and could transmit anewspaper photograph in three hours with five shades of gray.andM;The digital computer made many things possible.andP;  The general progression ofapplications is suggested by Figure 2.andP;  During this whole period, imageprocessing made substantial progress, even though any given period may havebeen dominated by another application.andP;  For example, the Jet PropulsionLaboratory (Pasadena, California) in 1964 used image processing to correctand improve pictures of the moon sent to earth by Ranger 7.andP;  This required alarge, fast, and expensive computer with a very sophisticated display.andP;  Theseimage devices were usually complex and expensive.andM;Since that time, several developments have converged to simplify, reducecost, and make these services generally more accessible.andP;  The most dramaticdevelopment is the introduction of the personal computer.andP;  With the PC, usershad access to a system with large amounts of memory, fast processing, andmass storage.andP;  Another line of convergence is the television industry, whichhas undergone its own evolution by way of the invention of home videosystems.andP;  Television cameras have decreased in price and increased inquality.andP;  We also note such other technological advances as optical storage,new high-resolution gray and color displays, high-speed processors, parallelprocessors, and floating-point processors.andP;  These and many other advanceshave created the situation wherein image is no longer used only in the worldof science.andP;  Image is now cost effective in business.andP;  The focus of thispaper is the use of image technology in modern business.andP;  Here we look at thetechnological concepts needed for line-of-business image as well as suchother applications as a database of photographs.andM;It is interesting to contemplate the development of communication of a personand the evolution of computers.andP;  When a baby is born, the first form of dataacquired and learned is image--the mother's facial expression and tone of hervoice, a visual and aural image of the baby's mother.andP;  Next toddlers learn todraw grpahics.andP;  Text follows, and numbers are last.andP;  Computer evolution hasbeen just the opposite: numbers, text, graphics, and finally image.andM;Image versus graphics.andP;  In today's world of super special effects in sciencefiction movies, it is becoming difficult to separate image from graphics.andO;There is, however, a basic distinction: images are captured, whereas graphicsare created.andM;If a user begins with a capture device such as a scanner and &quot;takes apicture&quot; into the computer, the result is an image.andP;  Graphics are drawn, asimple example being a bar chart.andP;  A good analogy for illustrating thedifference is the difference between a painting and a photograph.andP;  A paintingis a graphics design because, even though it can appear very realistic, ithas been created.andP;  A photograph, on the other hand, is the captured image ofreality.andP;  Even if a photograph were to be shot through a special-effects lensor filter and even if it does not look realistic, it still is aphotograph--an image.andP;  Thus we see the basic disttinction between graphicsand image.andM;Another key point is that images are stored electronically in raster lines ofpixels, and graphics are stored as series of commands.andP;  However, graphics canbe converted to artificial images through filling and shading.andP;  The word&quot;artificial&quot; refers not to whether it is a true image but to its origin.andO;Synthetic image is another term used for artificial image.andP;  However, oncecreated, an image's origin cannot be determined.andP;  This fact has no effect onthe principles of image technology as discussed in this paper.andM;A look of realism does not guarantee a true image; artificial images can beextremely realistic.andP;  Many of today's graphics pictures are actually toorealistic.andP;  Usually, reality is not as perfect as computer-generated graphicsappear, which is the usual tip-off to an artificial image that is createdgraphically, rather than an image that was captured.andP;  It is common practicenow that special effects for movies are often created in a computer asartificial images, rather than built as models and photographed.andM;Noncoded information.andP;  Image is one form of non-coded data.andP;  In coded data,each unit of information, often a byte or word, has meaning.andP;  In noncodeddata, there is no unit of information.andP;  The bytes represent only light levelson an area.andP;  Digital voice or audio, such as on compact discs, is anotherexample of noncoded data.andP;  Graphics would be an example of coded data becausethe unit of information is a graphic command.andP;  The usual sources of images inan enterprise are the writing or printing on pieces of paper, photographs, orthree-dimensional scenes.andM;Up to 95 percent of all information used in an enterprise is noncoded or,said another way, only 5 percent of the information in many businesses iscoded in nature.andP;  Phone calls, handwritten communications, letters, and suchare potential sources of noncoded data.andM;Today only 5 percent of business data is coded into a computer.andP;  That is,only 5 out of 100 items of data are stored.andP;  Each of the remaining 95 piecestakes about 10 times as much space per piece because of its noncoded nature.andO;Thus it takes about 200 times as much space to store that 95 percent as theoriginal 5 percent.andP;  that is, 20 times as many pieces require 10 times morespace per piece.andM;A scanned page of text is a picture of that text, a fact that becomesimportant in two areas.andP;  The storage requirement of an image is about 10times as great as that for coded information.andP;  More important, if you wish torevise the text, you cannot use a text editor for an image.andP;  Text editors arebuilt to work on coded text where each byte represents a character.andP;  On theother hand, an image of text is merely a picture.andP;  Optical characterrecognition (OCR) is the process of converting a picture of the image back tothe ASCII or EBCDIC byte that represents it.andP;  When writing a document with aword processor, you may use OCR to convert a printed paragraph back to ASCII,so that it can be imbedded in the document.andP;  Also, once the page has beenconverted back into bytes, a search of the contents can be performed.andP;  Animage cannot be searched, except by the human visual process.andM;Vision.andP;  To complete our discussion of image, we look at another term used inimage technology--vision.andP;  Vision means not only to see but also tounderstand the contents of an image.andP;  For example, television is an imagedevice in that it captures, stores, and displays image.andP;  A robot, on theother hand, may use a television camera and a vision system to locate a partin an assembly line.andP;  This locating operation is broken down into two steps.andO;First, the image is captured into the computer using the camera.andP;  Second, theimage is analyzed to understand its contents in order to locate a desiredpart.andP;  This is vision in the form of image processing, and as such it can beused in the office and in manufacturing.andM;An image of a printed page is simply a picture of that page.andP;  Although it maylook like text, the text cannot be edited using a word processor.andP;  To do thisyou must convert the picture of the text into actual coded text, which may bedone by optical character recognition (OCR).andP;  OCR is another manifestation ofthe understanding of an image.andP;  Here a page of typed or written text isscanned, then the OCR function recognizes the images of the characters andconverts them back into a coded representation.andP;  The result of this processis an image of the page and text file of the content.andM;Vision is used to examine the contents of an image and to extract features.andO;In a manufacturing line, a vision system may be used to locate a part on theassembly line, so that a robot arm can pick it up.andP;  Locating solder joints ona circuit board so that a probe can be placed is another common use ofvision.andP;  An important use of vision in manufacturing is defect detection.andP;  Avision system may be used to examine a solder joint and look for cracks.andO;These types of jobs are good uses for vision systems because the repetitionof the job makes them very tedious for people to do on a continuing basis.andM;Image systemsandM;There are a variety of reasons for an enterprise to buy an image system.andP;  Oneof the most common is to reduce the cost of handling paper.andP;  This reducedcost comes from several factors.andP;  There is no need to file paper documents,and this saves the cost of filing space, the cost to perform the filing, andthe cost of retrieving the paper.andP;  Another cost-saving factor is the avoidedcost of locating lost paper.andP;  When a folder of paper is in use, no one elsecan use it.andP;  The folder can be misfiled when it is returned, thereby furtherconfusing the matter.andM;A benefit of an image system is speed of retrieval.andP;  Active documents thatare not in archive can be found in seconds.andP;  When talking to a client on thephone, speedy document retrieval can make the difference between a quickanswer and playing telephone tag, while trying to get back with the neededinformation.andP;  Speed can also be a factor in sending a document to a remotelocation.andP;  The FAX machine has affected the overnight courier business byproviding electronic delivery in seconds.andP;  This applies to image systemsalso.andP;  Local communications in image systems are very fast; remote accss isoften available at a longer response time.andP;  This difference in time is aresult of the speed of the communications line.andM;Image activities.andP;  The basic image activities include capture, display orprint, file, and communicate.andP;  Advanced image activities include edit,vision, enhance, and analyze.andP;  A basic business image system is illustratedin Figure 3.andM;Capture.andP;  The process begins with the capture of the image.andP;  To capture animage is to get the data into a computer from the original source ofdocument, photograph, or other hard copy.andP;  The two basic types of imagecapture are scanning and video digitizing.andM;Scanning.andP;  In the office, scanners are perhaps the most common way to captureimages.andP;  A scanner looks similar to a photocopier.andP;  A piece of paper isinserted into the machine, and the image is scanned.andP;  The key distinctionhere is that the original object is a piece of paper.andP;  This paper could be aphotograph or a print on plastic, but it cannot be a three-dimensionalobject.andP;  This same restriction applies to most photocopiers.andP;  The scannerspeed varies greatly with the model and the kind of image the scanner isbuilding.andP;  A scanner that can work in both bilevel and gray usually runs muchslower in gray because eight-times as much data must be sent to the computer.andO;The communications connection is another speed limiter.andP;  A scanner like theone used in the IBM ImagePlus[TM] system canwork at one page per second,whereas a lower-cost scanner, such as the IBM PageScanner[TM] dvice, takesabout thirty seconds for the same page and image.andP;  Color scanners require athree-fold increase in the amount of data recorded compared to a grayscanner.andM;Video digitizing.andP;  Another approach is to use a video camera attached to avideo digitizer.andP;  The video camera creates a television signal that the videodigitizer then converts to digital information in the computer.andP;  Video lendsitself to three-dimensional originals.andP;  There are many types of videodigitizer cards, which vary by resolution and number of shades of gray orcolors.andP;  A slow card may take up to eight seconds to do a capture.andP;  This iscalled a slow-scan video digitizer.andP;  A real-time video digitizer can capturean image in one-thirtieth of a second.andP;  It is important to use a real-timedigitizer when taking pictures of people, because a slow scan unit requiresthat a person remain still for as long as eight seconds.andP;  There are twopopular resolutions in videos, 640 by 480 and 320 by 240, wherein the unit ofthe first number is pixels per line and the second number is the number oflines in the image.andP;  A full, high-quality video signal can give a 640 by 480image, which is called a full-frame of video.andP;  A frame of video is made up oftwo fields, each of 240 lines.andP;  A field grabber will take a 320 by 240 imagein one-sixtieth of a second.andM;Other capture devices.andP;  Other image-capture devices not often thought of assuch include satellites, medical scanners, and seismic readers.andP;  Imagesderived from infrared, X-rays, and ultraviolet radiation are outside humanvisual capabilities.andP;  One purpose of an image display station is to processand show these invisible images to the user.andM;FAX.andP;  A FAX (or facsimile) machine may be compared to a pair of photocopiersconnected by a telephone line.andP;  The original flat document is fed through onemachine, which captures the image of the page.andP;  The image data are then sentvia the telephone line to the other machine, which prints the image.andP;  One ofthe major factors leading to the success of the FAX machine is that there isone standard way of describing the data.andP;  Almost all FAX machines conform tothe International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative Committee (CCITT) FAXstandards.andM;A FAX modem is used to connect to the phone lines.andP;  A FAX modem is unique inthat the modem and system transmit and receive only images and do notcommunicate with regular data modems.andP;  The text that the FAX system prints onthe page is not true text but an image of the text.andP;  For a computer to sendtext to a FAX machine, the computer must change the text into image, i.e., itmust rasterize the text.andM;The FAX machine has become such a widely used image device because almost allFAX machines talk using the CCITT Group 3 standard.andP;  This makes it possiblefor almost all brands of machines to exchange images.andP;  FAX cards for personalcomputers are also quite common.andP;  With such a card, a FAX machine can becomea remote scanner/printer.andP;  Because FAX machines talk only image, performanceis a major limiting factor in extending the usage further.andM;Image termsandM;Resolution and picture elements.andP;  The term resolution is used in thediscussion of video to refer to the dimensions of the image in pels per lineand by the number of lines (e.g., 640 by 480).andP;  This is one form ofresolution.andP;  Many definitions of resolution exist, depending on the way it isused.andP;  It is very important to understand exactly how the term is used todetermine the meaning.andP;  In principle, all definitions of resolution are basedon the ability of a system to distinguish closely spaced lines or points.andP;  Atelescope that cannot distinguish a double star is said to be unable toresolve a double star, for example.andP;  In video, we use resolution to mean thenumber of pels in the width and the number of pels in the length of an image,independent of the size of the television screen.andP;  This gives us the totalnumber of pixels in an image but does not tell us the size of the original.andO;Thus, the greater the number of pixels per image, the higher is theresolution of that video system.andM;Another definition of resolution is pels per unit of measure, such as 200pels per inch (ppi).andP;  With this definition, if weknow that the image is 200ppi and the image has a width of 1000 pels, we can calculate the width of theoriginal to be 5 inches.andP;  When resolution is expressed in this way, we alsoneed to know the maximum number of pels in each direction or the maximum sizeof the original.andP;  This approach is most common with scanners.andP;  An example isthe IBM PageScanner device that supports 300 ppi over an 8.5-inch by11.7-inch area.andP;  Here it is considered important to preserve the size so thatletters on a page are reproduced at the same size.andP;  When readingspecifications on scanners from countries that use metric measurements,resolution many also be given in microns per pel.andP;  Occasionally we see thenumber of bits per pel or number of shades of gray also called resolution.andO;This, however, is not generally accepted terminology.andP;  Also, dots per inch(dpi) is used to describe the resolution of printers.andM;To enhance an image is to make it more useful.andP;  An example is to sharpen thefocus on an image to bring out hidden details.andP;  If an image has poor focus oris blurred due to motion during the capture, image enhancement can be used tobring the picture back to a more useful state.andP;  Sha rpening the focus is veryuseful when looking for hidden details but any noise in the image will bebrought out also.andP;  Softening the image removes noise at the sacrifice ofdetail.andP;  Often combinations of techniques are used, such as a median filterto remove noise followed by a high pass filter to enhance the sharpness orfocus of the image.andM;One last comment on resolution concerns a distinction between addressable anddiscrete resolution.andP;  Consider the pixels illustrated in Figure 4.andP;  With 50percent overlapping pels, if this were a 200-ppi pattern, the addressableresolution is 200 ppi, whereas the discrete resolution is only 100 ppi.andP;  Thisdifference in resolution between addressable and discrete is the result ofthe pel overlap.andP;  discrete resolution refers to the number of pels per inchas defined by the diameter of the pel.andP;  In this example a pel is 0.01 inch.andM;Almost all specifications quote only the addressable resolution.andP;  Thediscrete resolution can be calculated from the pel diameter, if quoted, andfrom this we can calculate the amount of pel overlap.andP;  A device with highaddressable resolution but low discrete resolution shows smooth edges onlines, but it cannot produce fine detail.andM;The aspect ratio of a pel is the ratio of width to height.andP;  If the width isthe same as the height, that is the width-to-height ratio is 1, then the pelis said to be a square pel.andM;A square pel is very desirable.andP;  Both the geometric square and circle fallwithin the square-pel definition.andP;  If a pel is not square, a correction mustbe made when the image is rotated in order for the image to not appear assquashed or skewed.andP;  Most printers, displays, and capture devices now give asquare pel.andP;  However, a square pel does not mean that the width and height ofthe total image are the same.andP;  As an example, a video image with 640 by 480pels has a square pel, but the overall image is not square.andM;Although many people have heard of a pixel, few have heard of athree-dimensional pixel (3D pixel).andP;  A 3D pixel is one with not only widthand height but also depth.andP;  We usually think of a pixel as a square, but a 3Dpixel is a cube of image data.andP;  Such a pixel is created by an undergroundscanner, which is used when looking for oil, or by a body scanner when doingmedical analysis.andP;  A 3D pixel is termed a voxel, meaning volume pictureelement.andM;Types of images.andP;  Three major types of image are dealt with in this paper:bilevel or two-level image, gray, and color.andM;Bilevel image.andP;  A black-and-white image is the most common and simplestexample of a bilevel image, although any two-color image falls within thedefinition.andP;  A newspaper is an excellent example of a bilevel image.andP;  Eacharea of a page is either black ink (assuming the newspaper is not printed incolor) or white paper.andP;  In image terms, each pel is either black or white.andM;Photographs in a newspaper appear to be composed of areas of gray.andP;  This isan illusion of the eye.andP;  If a newspaper photograph is examined under amagnifying glass, the arrays of black dots of which the photograph iscomposed become visible.andP;  When these dots are sufficiently fine and tightlypacked so that the eye cannot see (resolve) the individual black pels, theeye averages the areas to shades of gray.andP;  This is called halftoning and isthe basis of most image printing technology.andP;  Halftoning is illustrated inFigure 5.andM;Most bilevel image original documents are pieces of paper with handwriting,typing, or printing on them.andP;  When working in bilevel, the color of the inkand the paper are ignored, with dark blue and black ink both showing up asblack pels on a white field.andP;  This is the same principle as is used by aphotocopier.andP;  Also, the bilevel image does not truly indicate black ink onwhite paper.andP;  The bilevel image could have been blue ink on pink paper.andO;Therefore we refer to &quot;bilevel,&quot; rather than &quot;black-and-white&quot; images.andM;In FAX, most documents for the office are printed, typed, or drawn with blacklines on a white paper background.andP;  Because the FAX system is looking fordark ink, a 1 (true) is used for ink and a 0 (false) is used for paper.andP;  Noindication of the true color of the ink or paper is given, just that the inkwas dark and the paper light.andP;  To this day, these are the standards inbilevel image.andP;  As will be noted later in this paper, this is the opposite ofthe gray and color standards, in which 0 means black and I means white.andM;Gray image.andP;  Black-and-white television is classified as a gray visualdisplay device.andP;  Each pel on the screen is a shade of gray, not black orwhite as in halftoning.andM;Most gray systems use 256 shades of gray as their granularity or shaderesolution.andP;  This is due both to the historical use of a byte per pel and tothe fact that the untrained human eye cannot see more than 256 shades ofgray.andP;  (Actually most persons cannot distinguish more than 128 shades ofgray.)andP;  Medical and scientific imaging systems tend to need more levels, notbecause scientists can necessarily see more, but because--by changing the waypeople look at the data--they can sense details that are beyond human vision.andO;Although a person looking at a 256-shade image and a 1024-shade imageprobably cannot detect any difference, the computer can artificially changethe intensity scale to focus attention on part of the scale and make tinychanges perceivable.andM;Both gray and color images are referred to as continuous-tone images, becausemost gray and color images are derived by the digital sampling of continuous(analog) information.andP;  Most gray images start as photographs or 3D objects.andM;As mentioned previously, bilevel image is based on a FAX-and-scanning-papermodel.andP;  Thus 0 (false) means paper (white) and 1 (true) means ink (black).andO;Gray image is based on television, therefore 0 (false) is the absence oflight (black), and 1 (true) is the presence of light nwhite).andP;  To avoid theconfusion of 255 beig white on an 8-bit scale and 1023 being white on a12-bit scale, gray image work often refers to 0 to 1 with fractional valuesfor the gray scale.andM;People see neither colors nor gray-scale information equally.andP;  This knowledgeis invaluable when assessing priorities in the design of image systems.andP;  Forexample, changes in dark gray are perceived more easily than changes in lightgray.andP;  If you view a scale with equal steps of gray as measuredscientifically, your mind will tell you the dark shades are changing morequickly than the bright shades.andP;  This creates an interesting problem in thatmost image-capture devices break down gray to equal steps of reflected light.andO;If you look at a scale of gray values and ee it as equal steps, you areviewng a gray logarithmic scale.andP;  A logarithmic scale changes black slowly.andO;The rate of change from black to white accelerates in these devices as theymeasure more and more white.andM;It is a basic problem that computers process image data differently than thebrain and eye, a fact that has to be accounted for in a system for creatingrealistic-looking images.andP;  It so happens that prception by all the senses islogarithmic.andP;  We can see in very dim light and hear the brush of grassagainst a foot.andP;  At the same time, we are not overwhelmed by desert light orthunder, both of which on a linear scale would be painful.andM;Halftoning.andP;  The purpose of halftoning is to create the illusion of gray bymeans of bilevel pel patterns.andP;  Halftoning is often used with printers, butit can also be used with bilevel displays.andP;  Pictures in newspapers andmagazines, as mentioned earlier, are printed using the halftone process.andM;As an example, assume a matrix of 4 by 4 pels, which is used to create theillusion of gray shades.andP;  To show solid black, all pels within the matrix areblack.andP;  To show dark gray, most pels are black.andP;  For light gray, most pelsare white, and for white, of course, all the pels are white.andP;  Figure 5 showsa very simple form of halftoning.andP;  There are many more advanced techniquesthat give superior results.andP;  However, all are based on the same basicprinciple that the more black pels in an area, the darker it seems.andM;Discrete resolution plays a significant part in halftoning.andP;  To create theillusion of gray, the patterns of black pels should be small enough that thehuman eye cannot resolve them individually.andP;  An excellent example of this isblack-and-white photography.andP;  Most people assume that a photographic printshows continuous shades of gray.andP;  Actually, it does not.andP;  A black-and-whitephotograph is a collection of metallic silver grains on white paper.andP;  Thesegrains are very small and spaced in random patterns.andP;  They become obviousonly when a negative is enlarged greatly, and the visible grains are referredto as photographic grain.andP;  High-speed film uses larger grain size in part toachieve the higher speed.andM;Color image.andP;  Except for filling in areas with colors of a single hue, thestandard color process is known as the red-green-blue (RGB) process.andP;  Thisprocess mimics the three color-sensitivity bands of the human eye.andP;  The RGBprocess is used for all color imaging applications: photography, printing,television, and other forms of color imaging.andP;  The color printing process isa four-color process because black is added and, for technical reasons,printer colors are the complements of RGB: magenta (RGB minus G), cyan (RGBminus R), and yellow (RGB minus B).andP;  The underlying principle, however, isthe same.andP;  One can observe this process by looking closely at a televisionscreen where one can see the red, green, and blue dots.andP;  Similar to grayimages, 256 intensities for each of the red, green, and blue are available.andO;The red, green, and blue are called bands of the image, and all color imageshave contributions from each of the three banks.andP;  Gray and bilevel imageshave one band each.andP;  The blending of the intensities of RGB gives the variouscolors.andP;  All three bands at full brightness are seen as white.andM;As in gray, the medical and scientific communities often need 12 bits per pelper band rather than eight.andP;  With eight bits per pel per band, there are 16777 216 possible colors, and 12 bits yields over one billion colors.andP;  Humanperception is even poorer for color than it is for gray.andP;  The untrained eyecan distinguish only about 128 hues of green, 64 hues of red, and 16 hues ofblue.andP;  Whereas the exact number of hues per band can be argued, these are thecorrect ranges.andP;  This limitation on the ability of humans to discern color istaken into account in image processing, because it is what is perceived thatis important.andM;As with gray, most color-image originals are photographs andthree-dimensional objects.andP;  Color images are captured by scanning theoriginal three times, once each through red, green, and blue filters.andP;  Theactual capture may be done in one pass using a beam splitter or threesensors, but the process is the same.andM;If we see a leaf on television and the leaf is not the same green color asthe real leaf on the tree, we cannot know this until we compare thetelevision leaf with the real leaf.andP;  The reason is that the eye has no pointof reference with respect to the leaf, and the brain assumes that the coloras viewed is correct.andP;  This would not work if the televised leaf were toounrealistic in color.andP;  However, the eye is not easily fooled with aninaccurate flesh tone, unless it mistakenly assumes that too red a face, forexample, represents anger or embarrassment.andP;  Because the eye can detect acorrect flesh tone in a face without having to see the real face, the fleshtone is a reference color.andP;  The television industry goes to great lengths toensure that flesh tones are correct.andP;  Attention to reference colors in animage product that works with color is critical to human perception.andM;System considerationsandM;Images are constructed from large amounts of data, a fact that has someprofound impacts on system design.andM;Compression.andP;  The purpose of compression is to reduce the size of the dataused to represent a digital image for purposes of storage or communication.andO;Compression does not change the physical size or detail of the resultingimage.andP;  That is, a scanned 3- by 5-inch original after compression,transmission, and revisualization, results in a 3- by 5-inch output digitalimage.andP;  The idea of compression is to reduce the amount of data used torepresent the image primarily by techniques that reduce redundantinformation.andP;  To make an image physically smaller is called reduction; tomake an image physically larger is called enlargement.andM;There are many different types of compression schemes, and these are tied tothe type of image being compressed.andP;  They also assume a model of thecharacteristics of the image.andP;  An example is the compression used for FAX,which assumes a scanning rate of 200 ppi on a page that is mostly white withblack lines and characters.andP;  This sounds quite reasonable until we considerthe problem of compressing halftoned photographs, which consist of short runsof white and black.andP;  The use of FAX compression on a halftoned image cancreate more data than are present in the uncompressed data image.andP;  Codes areused to represent the sequences of white and of black.andP;  These codes are ofvariable lengths, with very short codes given to very common things and verylong codes given to uncommon things.andM;Lossless versus lossy systems.andP;  At present, there are two classes ofcompression: lossless and lossy.andP;  In lossless compression the decompressedimage is exactly the same as the original image.andP;  In lossy compression, thedecompressed image is almost the same.andP;  The purpose of a lossy compression isto minimize the amount of data while maintaining visual integrity.andP;  Losslesscompression is better when high visual fidelity is required, and lossy isbetter when more compression is desired.andP;  Often it is not necessary for theimage to be exactly the same as the object.andP;  The choice requires tradeoffsbetween fidelity and transmission efficiency.andP;  Perhaps all that is needed isto be able to read the text in the image, not to study the exactconfigurations of the letters.andP;  Lossy is most common in gray and colorcompression.andP;  An exact compression (another way to say lossless compression)of color may yield only a 2-to-1 or 3-to-1 reduction in quality of imagedata, whereas a lossy compression, with loss that is beyond most humanperception, can yield a reduction of 20 to 1.andP;  When we look at the amount ofdata we deal with in color, this can make a significant difference in storageor communications requirements.andM;Target of the image.andP;  When choosing between lossy and lossless compression,the target of the image becomes a key consideration.andP;  If the target is aperson who will casually view a picture, a lossy-compression method with itsreduced data size is preferred.andP;  On the other hand, if the person is a doctorlooking at a digital X-ray, the highest possible fidelity is vital to theinterests of the patient.andM;When defining a pixel, we noted that one's eyes do not notice the squares.andO;This is an extremely important concept.andP;  Human vision is the key to mostbusiness image processing.andP;  It is not what is there that is important, butwhat people perceive as being there.andP;  This is a generalization that hasexceptions, but it is still a very useful concept.andP;  Human perception has aneffect on how images are displayed, printed, compressed, and enhanced.andO;Medical imaging uses computers to enhance digital X-rays to help locate areasof interest, thereby enhancing the resulting human perception of the image.andM;Machine vision is an exception to the rule of human perception.andP;  In machinevision, the target of the image is a machine rather than a human being.andO;Machines do not have the perception weaknesses of a human being, and machinescan locate things in an image that are beyond human perception.andM;Compressed image sizes.andP;  Certain rules of thumb exist for storing the imageof a page.andP;  One thing that is very constant is that images require morestorage to represent a page than the coded version of the same page.andP;  A pageof printed text, stored as text, requires about 3K bytes of storage.andP;  Thatsame page stored in image form requires about 25K bytes of storage.andP;  This isan eight-fold increase in size.andP;  Also the image format cannot be interrogatedas can coded text.andP;  An 8.5- by 11-inch bilevel business letter at 200 ppicompresses to about 25 kilobytes (KB) of storage per page.andP;  At 300 ppi thatsame page requires about 40 KB of storage.andP;  This assumes a page with a fewparagraphs of typing.andP;  A very complex page, such as an insurance form,requires at least double the storage required for straight text.andP;  Inengineering work, a page of 33 by 44 inches is known s an E-size drawing.andO;With this increased physical size comes an increase in compressed-data size.andO;Data for an E-size page can range from 250 KB to 500 KB.andP;  These are not hardand fast rules, but rules of thumb.andM;Size and complexity of the original object contribute to the size of thecompressed image.andP;  Compressing gray and color photographs is also affected bythe content.andP;  For a video-resolution image (640 by 480) of a face with lossycompression and excellent visual integrity, the size is 25 KB in gray and 40KB in color.andP;  Faces are relatively simple to compress.andP;  However, a busypicture like a house with shrubbery and many details might require 50 KB ingray and 80 KB in color.andM;Object interchange architectures.andP;  A document is a collection of pages thatcan include text, graphics, and images.andP;  A very important consideration inimage work is data-stream selection.andP;  Image data are not easy to convert toalphanumeric data.andP;  Also, because of the large size of the databases thatenterprises are building, data conversion may be impractical.andP;  Theseconsiderations are illustrated in Figure 6.andM;The IBM Systems Application Architecture[TM] (SAA[TM]) document data streamis Mixed Object Document Content Architecture-Presentation (MO:DCA-P).andO;MO:DCA-P is a carrier data stream that consists of objects and the layoutinformation that specifies how a document is to be printed or displayed.andO;Objects may be in line as part of the document, or they may reside in anexternal library.andM;Objects that can be carried in MO:DCA-P include text, image, graphics, andfonts.andP;  In an image system, these are the most common objects to carry.andO;However, MO:DCA-P can carry other types of objects, as required.andP;  ImageObject Content Architecture (IOCA) is the data stream for images, the purposeof which is to put the image data into a format that can be understood byanother program.andP;  Things like type of image, width, length, resolution,compression type, and such must be carried in the data stream.andP;  Then an imagebecomes self-contained, that is, other programs can interpret the imagewithout referencing a separate database for such data.andP;  Often image datacannot be interpreted without the associated data.andP;  IOCA can handle bilevel,gray, and color images.andP;  MO:DCA-P is used to describe where on a page animage is to be placed.andP;  Although having an image data stream is obvious, itis not as obvious why there is a text data stream in an image product.andP;  Theanswer comes from storage requirements.andP;  The purpose of a document system ina business is to store documents , and an image is just one type of objectthat a document may carry.andM;It is common in an enterprise for customer correspondence to be on preprintedforms.andP;  If the completed forms are scanned and stored in a database, theresult would be to store multiple copies of the form.andP;  Also, the printedmaterials would be sotred as image rather than as text, meaning that image isat least eight times larger.andP;  Instead, the idea is to store the printed dataas text along with its font description and a reference to an image of theform stored in a sample-form library.andP;  Then, when the document is requested,the system presents the text information in the correct font and overlays iton the form.andP;  The operator sees the same document, with at least aneight-fold reduction in storage.andP;  A comparison of the methodologies of (A)preprinted forms and (B) images is shown in Figure 7.andP;  The text data streamis Presentation Text Object Content Architecture (PTOCA), and the font datastream is Font Object Content Architecture (FOCA).andP;  Graphics, such as forannotating an image, could be represented with Graphics Objects ContentArchitecture (GOCA).andM;Types of storage.andP;  Because of the size and volume of image data, traditionalstorage media are often impractical.andP;  Three classes of storage becomeimportant in image processing: short-term, near-term, and long-term storage.andO;There are two key factors that separate one from the other--speed of accessand cost.andM;The highest-speed storage is usually the highest-cost storage.andP;  Therefore, itmust be used and reused on a short-term basis.andP;  Magnetic disk is the commonform of short-term storage for storing images.andP;  Large enterprises keep thedocuments that are being processed in short-term storage for quick retrieval.andO;Access to short-term, high-speed storage is measured in units that are lessthan a second.andM;A near-term storage system used for data that are needed in seconds is shownin Figure 8.andP;  Here the cost is expected to be lower.andP;  Stacks of optical disksanalogous to the records in a juke box are used as near-term storage in mostimage systems.andP;  In an optical juke box, the optical disks are stored inslots.andM;The turntable is one or more drives.andP;  When data from a disk are required, thearm fetches the selected platter from its slot and places it in an empty diskdrive.andP;  When use of the disk is complete, the arm returns the disk to itsslot.andM;Optical disks are use lasers analogously to magnetic read-write heads ofmagnetic disk drives.andP;  In a pure laser system, the laser is used to createpits in the disk material.andP;  There are three types of optical disks:read-only-memory (ROM), write-once-read-many (WORM), and write-many.andM;A ROM disk cannot be written on.andP;  The disk is stamped with all of the dataprewritten.andP;  The ROM disk is used for very stable data, such as manuals.andO;Music compact disks are an example of a ROM disk.andP;  One of the advantages iscost.andP;  Once a master disk is tooled, producing many disks is relativelycheap.andM;WORM disks can be written only once.andP;  The drive is able to burn a pit butcannot unburn one.andP;  WORM disks range from 500 megabytes (MB) of data tomultiple gigabytes (billion) per side of the platter.andP;  They are much lower incost than magnetic storage, but more expensive than ROM disks.andP;  Image systemsuse WORM disks for two reasons: They provide large amounts of storage at lowcost, and, because of their unchangeable nature, they have served as evidencein court for storage of documents.andP;  One of the advantages of an image systemis the elimination of paper movement.andP;  Storing and moving paper is a bigexpense in business that an image system can remove.andP;  Much of the financialadvantage comes from destroying the original paper and relying on theelectronic form only.andP;  In previous systems, paper was photographed ontomicrofilm and the paper destroyed.andP;  If the document was required in court,the microfilm version was presented as the best available evidence.andP;  Detailsof legal aspects of optial storage are still being worked out.andM;Another interesting feature of WORM is the ability to destroy data storedthere.andP;  It is not possible to change data because bits cannot be undone, butit is possible to destroy data by setting all bits on.andP;  In many environmentsit is necessary to destroy data rather than just flat it for deletion.andM;A write-masny optical disk is just like a magnetic disk in use, but thetechnology is different.andP;  Write-many disks casn be updated, although they aresomewhat slower than magnetic disks at this time.andP;  It will be interesting tosee how write-many disks are supported in the courts.andP;  Optical disks, becauseo their low cost, have made image applications practical.andM;Long-term storage is data that are archived outside the juke box.andP;  Long-termstorage requires an operator to mount the platter either in a drive or in ashelf of a juke box.andM;Impact of communications.andP;  As was shown, the large volume of image data hasquite a large impact on data storage.andP;  Because of the large volume of datainvolved, communications is also affected.andP;  When running an application thatuses numbers and letters for data, an average transaction is a screen of 2000bytes.andP;  Allowing for overhead and such, even a 2500-byte transaction loadwould be high.andP;  If an image transaction requests a page of image, a normalaverage would be between 50 to 60 KB.andP;  This is consistent with the typically20-fold increase in data volume.andM;This increase is not only seen between systems, but it also occurs to andfrom the input and output of a system.andP;  Consider printing an image as anexample.andP;  At 300 ppi an 8.5-by 11-inch page of print in bilevel is 1 MB ofdata.andP;  If a laser printer is rated at 10 pages per minute, this 1 MB of datawould have to travel to the printer in a maximum of 6 seconds.andM;From the discussion so far, we can conclude that image is a new data type tocomputers.andP;  With its size and characteristics come some considerations, butcomplete new areas of business automation are now possible.andP;  image can now bejustified in a business environment by providing new levels of service andsupport.andP;  With these new opportunities come new challenges.andM;Document management systemsandM;Document management primer.andP;  Understanding problems in the area of documentmanagement is the first step to understanding an image document managementsystem.andM;The challenge of document management can be summed up in three Rs:repositories, retention, and reference.andP;  All businesses have priorities odocuments that are retained for a period of time and then purged from theactive files.andP;  These documents are then archived for a legal retentionperiod.andP;  Before the document's end of file, it may be used or referred to byprofessionals.andP;  It may have been a piece of mail that was received, such as aclaim against an insurance policy.andP;  The claim document may have then beensent to a processing department, where the claim was processed by one or moreindividuals.andP;  Processing this claim may have required reference to historicaldocuments in a central file or repository.andP;  When processing is completed, theclaim request is filed in a folder.andP;  When the customer inquires about thestatus of the claim, a service person may request the file for review andthen respond to the inquiry.andM;All of these files, folders, and such are stored in the &quot;paper house.&quot;andP;  Ifone were to take a tour of a company's paper house one would get a feel forthe operation and for its application of the three Rs.andP;  One might ask one'sself a number of related questions:andM;* Where are the repositories?andP;  What is the volume of documents they contain?andO;Who maintains them?andM;* How long does the company retain the documents?andP;  Does the company have apurge strategy?andM;* Who refers to the document and how often?andM;Consider the following hypothetical paper house:andM;* Central files of 1 000 000 foldersandM;* File requests per week averaging 30 000andM;* Probability of 25 percent that the requested folder is out of the fileandM;* File growth rate of 5 percent per year (i.e., new folders minus purgedfolders)andM;* Suspense rate of 15 percent for claims processing, i.e., further processingdelayedandM;* Files missing for up to 45 daysandM;The following is a discussion of the above information gathered on ourhypothetical tour of the paper house.andP;  The magnitude of the documentmanagement challenge is difficult to comprehend.andP;  The processing, storage,retrieval, and use of 1 000 000 of anything is difficult to manage.andP;  We startwith the space required to hold this many folders, and we are confronted withthe fact that storage space is costly.andP;  The next issue is the size of thestaff to maintain this repository.andP;  There are probably 30 to 50 people doingfiling, retrievals, and chasing out-of-file folders.andP;  Let us assume that thatthere are 30 000 requests per week by processing personnel for folders.andP;  Thatmeans 30 000 slips of paper come to the paper house each week, and 30 000times per week a clerk seeks out a folder in the paper house.andP;  Out of theserequests, 7500 times per week nothing is found, and a slip stating&quot;out-of-file&quot; is returned to the requestor.andM;Business executives know they have these problems, and in the followingsections we review some manual systems that are used today to solve some ofthem.andP;  We also look at the impact of operational image.andP;  A study, therefore,includes at least three areas of interest: the mail room, a service area, anda filing area.andM;Manual systems.andP;  Assume that the manual system under consideration hereincludes the special color coding of folders, special numbering schemes, andsometimes special equipment.andP;  As an example of special equipment, considerthat the 1 000 000 folders may be stacked on movable shelves so that aislesbetween the shelves appear and disappear as the clerks crank the shelves backand forth to find folders.andP;  This scheme reduces the amount of floor spacereserved for shelves.andP;  Other equipment that may be used are power files, inwhich the shelves are mounted on an assembly much like the seats of a Ferriswheel.andP;  The operator advances the power file shelf assembly with theassistance of a motor.andP;  Then the file is retrieved manually from the shelf.andM;The next level of advancement in filing systems might involve computerassistance to cross reference policy numbers to shelf locations.andP;  The clerkthen takes the file request to the terminal and enters a policy number to eta shelf location.andM;Another enhancement in manual systems might be to automate the requestprocess.andP;  For example, the requestor might place requests for files, using adata processing terminal.andP;  An application in the host might print pickinglists four times per day in a central files department.andP;  The lists might beprinted on address label stock together with the requestor's return address.andO;This list may be printed in a sorted order to optimize the clerk's retrievaltask.andP;  The application software that automates the requests eliminates themail time for the request slip to arrive at the repository location.andP;  For thereturn trip, the clerk puts the package together and drops it in the internalmail.andM;Microform systems.andP;  Microform technology as used by businesses generallyfalls into one of three forms: roll film (also called microfilm), jackets,and fiche.andM;All of these systems involve the photographing of documents on a film stock,the best known of which is the microflm system.andP;  This system involvescreating rolls of film with pictures of documents on them in arrivalsequence.andP;  A variation of this is the jacket system, which is an attempt toorganize microfilm into folders of related documents.andP;  To do this, the rollsof microfilm are cut up and filed in jackets that are equivalent to a paperfolder.andP;  The microfiche alternative results in similar filing sequence as thejacket.andP;  However, the fiche is created from a light-sensitive stock.andM;The advantage of microform systems is that the film equivalent takes upconsiderably less space than the paper.andP;  Microfilm indexing software isavailable on the market to aid in finding images on roll film.andP;  Some vendorshave racks that will hold many rolls of film, and the retrieval is automatedby robotics.andP;  After loading the rol the view station will fast forward to thedesired document.andP;  Retrieval for jackets and fiche is done manually withperhaps the assist of color schemes for the top edges of the jackets andpower files to hold the repository.andM;These systems do little or nothing for the person who is trying to process aclaim.andP;  The requestor still has to wait for internal mail to return theneeded documents for review.andP;  The file clerk sees the benefit of having asignificant reduction in out-of-file situations because the film never leavesthe respiratory.andP;  The clerk makes copies of the film for the requestor, and aview station has a printer option.andP;  The clerk makes copies of the film andplaces the document copies in the mail.andP;  The central files department gainsbenefit from microfilm systems, and requestors receive fewer out-of-fileresponses.andP;  All this increases the productivity of the clerical staff, but itdoes little for the end users of the documents.andP;  The must handle physicalpapers as they would in a manual system.andM;The image system.andP;  An image system, as illustrated in Figure 9, is designedto change the way companies handle business records.andP;  We now follow a claimthrough an image system.andP;  The claim is opened in the mail room and digitizedby a scanner or camera.andP;  The digital image of the claim is indexed in thesystem and dispatched to a processing department as electronic mail.andP;  Theprocessing department receives images at electronic speeds at an imageworkstation.andP;  The claims processor may need to see hitorical documents fromthe respiratory, which in this example are digitized images on optical media.andO;The documents can be retrieved at electronic speeds.andP;  There is no waiting forthe mail cart to deliver the request, for the clerk to pull the file, or forthe clerk to return the folder.andP;  The claims processor can coplete the actionitem in one pass.andP;  The folder is requested and transmitted electronically.andO;The out-of-file response is eliminated, because the documents never leave thesystem.andP;  Multiple access to a folder is possible, because many actions to anaccount may be required at one time.andP;  With an image system, many people canreference the folder, which results in productivity gain for the end users, areduced clerical staffing level, and a likely increase in service levelsthroughout the organization.andP;  Queries are handled in seconds.andM;Scope of image applications.andP;  Scope is an important factor in determining andmanaging business opportunities.andP;  A business should understand that thebenefits of image systems come from establishment-level solutions that tiemultiple departments together.andM;Department.andP;  The most commonly discussed image solution is one that solves aproblem within a department.andP;  Most image solutions implemented today aredepartmental solutions.andP;  A company might want to apply image to the centralfiles department or at the agency level.andP;  Each of these areas may be calleddepartmental in scope and my have different problem definitions.andM;The central files department would like a way to pull and print file requestsfaster.andP;  Such departments receive several thousand requests per wek and wouldlike to simplify the processing.andP;  One complicating factor is a 25 percentout-of-file response to file folder requests from the central filing area.andO;Central files requires a system that improves the maintenance of centralfiles.andP;  The scope of the problem definition restricts the solutions toimproving clerical productivity for the central files department.andM;An agency might view image processing as the ability to electronicallydeliver new business applications to the company's underwriters.andP;  The agentis defining his problem as the company's ability to deliver the applicationmore quickly to the underwriter and thereby improve turnaround time in theprocessing of new business applications.andM;Establishment.andP;  An establishment view of image processing would includeseveral departments for which the solution would require a comprehensive,integrated approach to applying image technology.andP;  This scope requires acompany to examine the integration of image with existing data applications.andO;The company has to look beyond the limited payback within a department and tolook at the possible savings across the establishment.andM;An establishment-level solution will help documents flow within and betweendepartments.andP;  It will bring the establishment closer together throughelectronic image delivery.andP;  This step is similar to electronic mail exceptthat instead of keying in data, scanners are used to create an electronicimage for delivery.andM;Enterprise.andP;  The enterprise is the largest scope for an application andincludes multiple establishments in the solution architecture.andP;  Theestablishment could have several companies under a holding company or perhapsbe in several other businesses.andP;  Enterprise solutions may be studied todayfor volume procurement purposes.andM;Integrating these separate departmental systems could be very costly withouta document management strategy for the organization.andP;  One's position shouldbe that the data processing system is the logical place to begin theintegration of data and document management systems.andP;  The business isprocessed on the data processing systems, and this investment should beleveraged further to include document management.andP;  The installation of adepartmental system will result in the duplication of information on twosystems and the necessity to synchronize those systems.andP;  The problem iscompounded if there are multiple departmental systems and even further ifthere are multiple vendors providing these systems.andM;Operational imageandM;An operational image system is shown schematically in Figure 10.andP;  Operationalimage is the use of image technology in applications that have the followingcharacteristics:andM;* High volume of documents to be processedandM;* Paper intensiveandM;* Access to documents required to complete work itemsandM;* Management of the paper flow critical to the customer's businessandM;Many vendors are attempting to provide a solution with high enoughperformance and function to meet the demanding requirements of an operationalimage environment.andM;In the past, users required efficient archival storage and wanted to avoidhaving folders out-of-file for long periods of time.andP;  These requirements weresatisfied with cost-effective microform solutions.andP;  As image technology hasdeveloped, the ability to retrieve the stored document more speedily thanwith microform systems has become an additional user requirement.andP;  The enduser wants electronic access to the stored document, as well as rapidretrieval of a printed copy.andP;  The need for multiple departments to shareaccess to their stored documents is an additional requirement.andM;A user's perception of how image technology will work is that first paper isconverted to digitized images at the point of mail delivery.andP;  The digitizedimages are then electronically dispatched to professionals for processing.andO;When all work groups have completed their tasks, the electronic foldercontains all pertinent information regarding actions taken.andM;We now discuss the major components of an operational image system.andM;Components of operational image.andP;  The major software components ofoperational image are:andM;* RepositoryandM;* Folder management subsystemandM;* Work-flow management subsystemandM;* User's applicationandM;Repository.andP;  The purpose of hte repository is to store objects.andP;  In a systemsuch as the one we have been describing, these objects are documents withimages in them.andP;  To avoid confusion with the term &quot;object&quot; as used indocument architectures, we call them simply &quot;documents.&quot;andM;Documents can be stored in several classes of storage.andP;  As explained earlier,the three classes of storage we deal with are short-term, near-term, andlong-term storage.andP;  The repository must keep track of where the documents arestored.andP;  It is normal for documents to reside in multiple classes of storage.andO;If a document was in long-term storage, it would not be moved to short-termstorage, then near-term storage.andP;  To do so would involve another copy writtenon optical storage in the juke box.andP;  The document would be moved toshort-term storage, then deleted when done.andP;  If a new copy is needed, it isreloaded in short-term storage.andM;Document and folder management subsystem.andP;  The repository is the place wheredocuments are stored.andP;  A document-and-folder-management subsystem is a placewhere the document profiles and the folder structures are kep.andP;  A folder is acollection of related documents.andP;  As an example, a folder might be alldocuments related to a particular customer.andP;  Folder schemes can range fromthe very simple to the very complex.andP;  A document and folder managementsubsystem must be capable of dealing with such questions as the following:andM;* Can a folder contain a folder?andM;* Can a document reside in multiple folders without multiple copies of thedocument?andM;* Are multiple repositories covered by the folder manager?andM;Each document has a profile that describes the document and the kind of datathat it contains, which might include owner of the document; date and time ofits creation; class of storage; security; description of document; retentionparameters; audit trails; name the document is known by in the repository,and so forth.andM;Such fields as class of storage and retention parameters are called themanagement policies, an example of which might be the following:andM;* Initially store on magnetic medium and optical juke box.andM;* After 30 days, delete from magnetic storage.andM;* After 90 days, move optical platter to shelf (archival storage).andM;* After 7 years, dispose of the optical platter.andM;A storage and retention policy for a more temporary document might be thefollowing:  Initially store on magnetic medium.andP;  After 30 days, and once thedocument has been handled, delete it from magnetic storage.andP;  A carefullydesigned set of management policies is a very important part of an effectiveimage system.andM;Work-flow management subsystem.andP;  Work-flow management software performs twomajor functions.andP;  One is to get documents from one point to another; this isthe highway system for the delivery of images.andP;  The other function is thedispatching of images to action queues.andP;  For example, in the mail room, adocument might be digitized by a scanner.andP;  A work-flow management subsystemallows for assigning an action and designating a processing department orindividual.andP;  The action request is queued.andP;  A more complex case might requiremultiple actions.andP;  These actions may be sequence dependent, or they might bequeued for parallel processing.andP;  Work-flow management software is a criticalenabling component to achieving the maximum benefits from an operationalimage implementation.andM;Work-flow software can be very simple or very complex.andP;  In a simple system,the user would manually direct the piece of work to the next station.andP;  In acomplex system, the processing of a document would be divided into a seriesof steps, based on the type of work to be done and such parameters as dollarlimits.andP;  A fully automated system would direct the document through thesteps, with decisions on where to send it next being made by the system.andO;This is a very complex system, and it is seldom done that way.andP;  A hybridsystem incorporating features of a manual and a fully automated system isusually used, with the exception cases being handled manually and the systemdirecting the standard cases.andM;Long-term storage of documents.andP;  A critical factor in image storage is thatof standards.andP;  When considering the storage of images over periods as long asyears or decades, there are questions that must be answered: Will the mediumsurvive?andP;  Will there be equipment that can read the medium?andP;  Will the datastream on the medium be understood?andM;The first point is one of the length of time a medium will last before errorsbegin to appear in the data.andP;  The length of time magnetic media can surviveis well understood, because magnetic media have been around for a long time.andO;Optical media technology, on the other hand, is not mature and has anuncertain shelf life.andM;While life of a medium is the most critical issue, it is the easiest of thethree issues to deal with.andP;  Availability of equipment is often a greaterproblem.andP;  In optical media, for example, there are currently no acceptedstandards, which probably means that the most prudent choice is to read anoptical disk in the brand of drive that created it (i.e., wrote it).andP;  Asoptical storage matures, this will probably change.andP;  With this change willcome the abandoning of many of the media types supported today.andP;  If thishappens, one will have to keep the older reader drive in working order atleast long enough to copy images onto the new media.andP;  As an example in themagnetic audio recording technology, technicians are still occasionallycalled upon to transfer old magnetic wire recordings onto magnetic tape.andO;Although it may seem easier to maintain an obsolete technology, it is oftenthe more difficult solution to the problem of long-term storage of documents.andO;There is a point at which it is cheaper to replace equipment than to maintainit.andM;Copying to new media may be the only acceptable alternative.andP;  New media posethe problems of cost of the new media and the xost of the time to transferfrom one medium to another.andP;  Unlike film-based storage, a digital copy is anexact duplicate of the original.andP;  Thus a digital image database is thepreferred means for long-term storage.andP;  However, when considering adata-stream technology, it is well to look to the future and consider whetherthe data stream is well accepted and whether the data stream is welldocumented.andM;If a data stream is well accepted, documentation is less of a concern,because it will be understood in the future.andP;  If a data stream becomes lesspopular but is well documented, a conversion transform can be written to anew standard.andP;  If, on the other hand, one does not have good documentation ona data stream, we may put future generations in the position of being unableto transform a data stream.andM;Concluding remarksandM;Many factors have held back image development in the past, but almost all canbe summarized in one word--cost.andP;  The main costs were in storage and CPUcycles.andP;  Teh introduction of optical storage has also given us large-scalestorage that, when compared to the cost of storing the original paper, ischeaper.andP;  Cost of memory and communications also delayed the development ofimage.andP;  Memory is dropping dramatically in price, and raw CPU cycles,particularly at the workstation, have jumped.andP;  An example is the ImageAdapter/A used in many of the ImagePlus workstations.andP;  This PS/2[R] card hasa 32 bit 8.5 MIPS RISC processor on it that only five years before would havebeen compared to a mainframe.andP;  Image work takes many CPU cycles.andP;  As anexample, to decompress a typical page of a business document takes over fivemillion cycles.andP;  The capabilities of the output devices have also jumped.andO;High resolution displays and printers are now becoming common and arereasonably priced.andM;General referencesandM;Architectures for Object Interchange, GG24-3296-00, IBM Corporation;available through IBM branch offices (1988), pp.andP;
