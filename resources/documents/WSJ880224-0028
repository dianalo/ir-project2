Analysts are forecasting further gains this year for Canada, the largest foreign supplier of gas to the U.S.    Even higher sales levels from Canada to the U.S. are likely over the next few years if, as expected, pipelines are expanded to carry additional supplies. But U.S. pipeline competitors and U.S. gas producers will try to impede Canadian sales efforts through regulatory battles, industry officials say.    According to Canada's National Energy Board, natural gas exported to the U.S. last year totaled 989 billion cubic feet, or about $1.94 billion at the Canada-U.S. border. By volume, the sales represented 5.4% of the 16.9 trillion-cubic-foot U.S. market. For 1988, the Canadian agency forecast sales value of $2.2 billion and volume of 1.08 trillion cubic feet to the U.S., the only Canadian export market.    Even more bullish is Crossborder Report, a Washington-based natural gas newsletter, which predicts a Canadian gain this year to 1.2 trillion cubic feet, or about 7.1% of the U.S. market. And the American Gas Association, a Washington-based trade group, says Canada's share of the U.S. market in the mid-1990s could reach two trillion cubic feet, or 10% of the expected U.S. market.    Canada's current success is partly attributable to the desire of Canada's natural gas producers to sell a huge inventory of uncommitted reserves in the main producing province, Alberta. The Canadian government has helped the producers by loosening regulations that once discouraged price-cutting.    Excess pipeline capacity still exists, but little of it is left on the conduits to such major markets as the U.S. Northeast and California. For the Northeast, the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission received applications for 31 projects last month, many of which involve more gas from Canada.    Urging quick regulatory action, an American Gas Association spokesman says additional gas supplies to the Northeast would be beneficial on economic and national security grounds, because they would displace at least 175,000 barrels a day of imported oil in 1990. But deliveries could be delayed by complex FERC proceedings, at which the merits of competing projects will be judged.    In the big California market, competitive Canadian prices have encouraged San Francisco-based Pacific Gas andamp; Electric Co. to favor imports, supplied by its Pacific Gas Transmission Co. unit. The average cost of Alberta gas delivered to the California border is no more than $2.31 a thousand cubic feet, or at least 16 cents less than the price charged by rival El Paso Natural Gas Co., a pipeline that delivers gas from the U.S. Southwest, says Sue Ann Schiff, senior vice president of Pacific Gas Transmission.    But she warns that the Canadian advantage could disappear if Alberta producers try to raise their prices during annual negotiations next month. She adds that Canadian gas could become more expensive if Pacific Gas Transmission loses out at a FERC hearing this spring, where U.S. competitors are seeking to change the rates charged by the pipeline.    El Paso Natural Gas supports the rate change, because the current system is &quot;biased against our gas,&quot; says Richard Baish, an El Paso vice president. Also supporting the change are a gas producing unit of Tenneco Inc. and the staffs of FERC and the California Public Utilities Commission. But Pacific Gas Transmission says that the existing system is appropriate and that the proposed changes would hurt California gas consumers.    Despite the rate battle, PGandamp;E and its unit are sufficiently confident about Canadian supplies to propose an expansion that could nearly double the current annual capacity of 365 billion cubic feet of the pipeline from Alberta. PGandamp;E says the expansion, which could cost as much as $1 billion, would take place over the next five years if markets in Southern California are interested.    Because they own a large part of Canada's gas reserves, major U.S. oil and gas companies such as Amoco Corp. and Exxon Corp. don't usually worry about import competition. But smaller, U.S.-based independent producers are concerned, says William Anderson, spokesman for the Washington-based Independent Petroleum Association of America.    The 6,500-member association is undertaking a lobbying effort in Washington to change regulations that it believes favor Canadian gas over domestic supplies, Mr. Anderson says. The effort could include opposition to certain pipeline expansions, he says. And Henry Lippitt, executive secretary of the California Gas Producers Association, questions the need for an expansion of the Alberta-to-California pipeline system. He says it could hurt the selling prices of local gas producers. </TEXT></DOC>
