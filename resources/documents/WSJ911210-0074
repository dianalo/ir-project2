As he has on several occasions over recent months, Mr.Gorbachev appeared to be stubbornly stalling in an effort toavoid the inevitable.</LP><TEXT>   Amid widespread speculation in Moscow that he would haveno alternative except to resign, Mr. Gorbachev refused toacknowledge that his central government had been treated asirrelevant by the weekend agreement of Russia, the Ukraineand Byelorussia to form a loose commonwealth.   Russian President Boris Yeltsin and the leaders of theother two republics froze Mr. Gorbachev out of their weekendtalks, in which they agreed to cooperate on the mostdifficult and dangerous issues, including joint armies, jointcontrol of nuclear weapons and even a common currency. Theirtreaty is open for the other republics to join and Russianofficials yesterday were optimistic that many republics wouldagree to do so.   But if many of the nine other republics don't join, thereis the possibility of riots in the streets, anarchy and civilwar -- a vision conjured up by Mr. Gorbachev and others whoadvocate retaining a central union government.   &quot;A Shakespearean drama is unfolding before our very eyes,&quot;said Father Gleb Yakunin, a member of the Russian parliamentwho helped man the barricades around the parliament buildingduring the failed August coup attempt. &quot;Gorbachev was likeKing Lear {Sunday}. He even banged his fist on the table andthat doesn't happen with him too often. There were tragicnotes in his voice.&quot;   The government daily Izvestia echoed that sentiment lastnight: &quot;Gorbachev's tragedy is a tragedy of a great personovertaken by his time.&quot;   The reasons for Mr. Gorbachev's grief are clear -- hisdomain is disappearing from under his feet.   Last night, he issued a statement calling for referendumsin the individual republics to consider the Minsk treaty anda special session of the Soviet Congress of People'sDeputies, which many believe has been extinct since the coup.&quot;The fate of a multinational state can't be defined by thewill of just the leaders of three republics,&quot; Mr. Gorbachevsaid. &quot;This question can be solved only constitutionally withthe participation of all sovereign states and by the will ofits people.&quot;   Mr. Gorbachev has spent the months since the defeat of theAugust coup attempt desperately trying to piece the unionback together. Looking ever more tired and exasperated witheach passing week, he has relentlessly insisted that thecentral government over which he presides must be preservedbecause the alternative could be bloodshed.   Yet he now has trouble keeping pace with events. Theweekend agreement appears to have taken him by surprise. Hisclose colleague, Nursultan Nazarbayev, president ofKazakhstan, said at a news conference that he and Mr.Gorbachev were surprised by the treaty: &quot;Gorbachev, like me,didn't know they would sign such a document.&quot;   What's more, the weekend agreement shows Mr. Yeltsin'swillingness to betray Mr. Gorbachev. For some time, Mr.Yeltsin had supported Mr. Gorbachev's commitment to a uniontreaty, but he has recognized that the growing resistance toMr. Gorbachev couldn't be overcome and so he gave in to thepowerful Ukraine republic's refusal to deal with the SovietPresident.   &quot;The Ukraine was quite clear. It would not negotiate withGorbachev,&quot; Yegor Gaidar, Mr. Yeltsin's economics and financeminister, said in an interview.   Mr. Yeltsin's spokesman, Pavel Voschanov, says Mr.Gorbachev's union treaty plan was doomed to fail because hecouldn't overcome the independence of the republics that haddeveloped since August. The republics had formed their ownpolitical systems, with different notions of human rights andeconomics. &quot;It turned out to be very difficult to overcomethese differences,&quot; says Mr. Voschanov. &quot;Gorbachev counted onhis personal prestige and charm to make him the core aroundwhich the republics would unite, casting away theirarguments. Nothing came of it.&quot;   In choosing Minsk as the new capital of theircommonwealth, the republics are planning a fresh start,completely independent of the old central government. &quot;It hadto be some place different than Moscow,&quot; said Mr. Gaidar, whowas present at the talks. &quot;As long as it was based in Moscow,the republics would think of the old system.&quot;   Indeed, Mr. Yeltsin and his advisers are keen to convincethe world that they have created an important new system. Thethree republics together account for the majority of thenation's industrial and agricultural wealth. They alsocontrol almost all the Soviet Union's nuclear weapons, exceptfor those located in Kazakhstan. The agreement states thatthe weapons will remain under joint control and Mr.Nazarbayev agrees. &quot;No distribution or division of nucleararms, or loss of control of nuclear weapons, will takeplace,&quot; said Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev.   Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk added that a newsystem for launching nuclear attacks had been established.Now there will be three nuclear buttons, each controlled by amember of the commonwealth. They must be pushedsimultaneously in order to launch the rockets, he said.   The three republics also will proceed together on economicreforms. The Ukraine has abandoned its intention to quicklyintroduce a separate currency, according to Mr. Gaidar. Theplan, he said, is for each republic to have its own centralbank and do business with Russia as any Western country woulddo with each other. &quot;It's a major thing that has happened,&quot;Mr. Gaidar said. &quot;We agreed to use the ruble for a longperiod of time.&quot;   Mr. Yeltsin agreed to put off his price liberalizationprogram, which was scheduled to begin Dec. 16, Mr. Gaidarsaid. He said the postponement is intended to giveByelorussia and the Ukraine time to get ready for similarprograms. The program will start in all the republics on Jan.2, he said. In return, Byelorussia and the Ukraine havepromised to keep food supplies coming to the Moscow regionand to take additional measures to improve these supplies inorder to help Moscow overcome its current food crisis.   But even as the three republics congratulated themselveson their plan, there was plenty of confusion. A SovietConstitutional Compliance Committee, which according to theagreement doesn't exist, planned to evaluate the legality ofthe treaty denying its existence, according to Tass. Neitherthe Soviet government nor the Russian government met todiscuss the treaty, reflecting the general state of paralysisgripping the country.   Some ominous clouds also began to gather. Conservativepoliticians warned that there would be a heavy price to bepaid for the attempted break-up. &quot;If we want to save ourpeople -- meaning each citizen of the former U.S.S.R. -- thenwe'll have to be prepared to take the harshest meanspossible,&quot; said Sergei Baburin, People's Deputy and leader ofthe Supreme Soviet's conservative faction. &quot;A junta ofpresidents has grabbed power and they've thrown out basiclaws. The completion of this agreement between the threeheads of these republics will push other republics away. Ithink we'll have at least two centers, one in Alma-Ata{Kazakhstan} and one in Minsk.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
