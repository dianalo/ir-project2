The statement by Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimovwas believed to be the first time the Soviet Union acknowledgedshipping missiles to Iraq, Iran's enemy in a 7{-year-old war.   The Soviets have been Iraq's chief arms supplier.   Western military analysts say Iraq has been using Scud-Bmissiles, fitted with strap-on boosters for added power, in recentattacks on the Iranian capital, Tehran. The city is 290 miles fromthe Iran-Iraq border.   Iran also uses Scud-Bs in its attacks on Iraqi cities.   The missiles have a range of 190 miles.   On Sunday, Iranian media reports blamed the Soviet Union for themissile attacks on Iran, prompting an angry mob in Tehran to try tostorm the Soviet Embassy.   Gerasimov, asked about the Iranian charges at a government newsbriefing, said Soviet missiles had been shipped to Iraq under anagreement between the two countries.   ``The Soviet Union previously delivered a limited shipment ofshort-range missiles,'' he said. ``We never gave our permission tomodify those missiles to increase their range, and modernizationwas not foreseen by that agreement.''   Gerasimov said the agreement ``ruled out'' modernizing themissiles.   ``This is the basis on which we're insisting that we havenothing to do with the `war of the cities,''' he said.   Iraq claims the missiles are Iraqi-made.   Another Soviet Foreign Ministry official, Vsevolod L. Oleandrov,was asked at the briefing if he believes the Iraqi claims. After along pause he said, ``It's difficult for us to say.''</TEXT></DOC>
