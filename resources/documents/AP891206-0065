Vaclav Havel said at a news conference that Communist PremierLadislav Adamec will present a list of names for the Cabinet toleaders of the pro-democracy movement for approval before the listis made public.   He refused to disclose any details of the intense negotiationsto include more non-Communists, as demanded by the nation'spro-democracy movement.   Adamec told the state-run news agency CTK that he had acceptedfrom Civic Forum, the leading opposition group, a list of possibleCabinet candidates.   He said he will consult with other official political parties onThursday, then meet again with Civic Forum, probably on Friday, andgive them his proposals.   It was not known whether either side had set special conditionsfor the opposition to approve the Cabinet.   The agreement on the new government represents the latest ofseveral dramatic concessions the Communists have made in the lasttwo months in the face of the growing pro-democracy movement. Theseinclude a loosening of travel restrictions, the resignation of theCommunist leadership of Milos Jakes and the end of the Communistsconstitutionally guaranteed hold on power.   Havel spoke after holding his first talks with Communist Partychief Karel Urbanek, who he said agreed with the opposition'sposition that ``young, able people and experts who are notdiscredited'' should be brought into the government.   After his 75-minute meeting with Urbanek, Havel and otheropposition leaders met briefly with Adamec, who is trying to form anew Cabinet after a coalition government he named Sunday ran intofierce popular resistance.   The opposition spurned that government because it brought injust five non-Communists and left Communists in control of all keyministries.   The opposition has threatened a general strike on Monday if anew federal government is not named by Sunday.   Havel said Adamec will consult Thursday with representatives ofother, increasingly independent official parties on forming a newgovernment.   The opposition will then learn the names of the new cabinetFriday.   Both the government and the opposition have refused to disclosedetails of their negotiations. Opposition sources said the talksenvisage some form of power-sharing before the free elections theopposition wants held by July.   Havel, who only a month ago was a banned playwright reviled inthe official press, said Urbanek admitted during theirunprecedented meeting that his Communist Party faces ``deeplyrooted mistrust,'' and must change.   But Urbanek told the opposition he has trouble convincing someregional party leaders of this, Havel said. Havel said Urbanekrequested a second meeting Thursday with cameras from state-runtelevision present.   The opposition leader did not say whether such a session wouldtake place, or whether it would be carried live on television.   Urbanek also assured the opposition that the party's unpopularparamilitary force, the People's Militia, has been completelydisarmed by the army and will probably be incorporated into thearmed forces.   Urbanek also admitted that the Czechoslovak secret police ``haslost all its purpose for internal matters,'' Havel said. He did notelaborate.   As the talks between Urbanek and Havel broke up, the CommunistParty chief could be heard telling actor Milan Knazko, anopposition leader in Slovakia, ``the most important thing now is tocalm people's emotions so that we don't have a food rationingsystem tomorrow.''   This appeared to be a reference to the possibility of economicchaos if the political crisis is not resolved soon.   The opposition scored a victory Tuesday when a parliamentarycommission named Jakes and former Prague Communist boss MiroslavStepan as politically responsible for a police crackdown onpeaceful students Nov. 17.   The commission recommended that both men be stripped of theirlast political posts as parliamentary deputies.   But the state-run news agency CTK quoted Jakes as saying today:``I fully reject political responsibility for the events of Nov.17, 1989, because the political decision was not to act against theparticipants of the demonstration. Any other statement is not trueand is guided by political ambitions.''   That crackdown spurred a week of enormous unrest that culminatedin the ouster of Jakes and some of his allies.   The naming of politicians and police held responsible for thecrackdown was a chief demand of the striking students who startedCzechoslovakia's massive pro-democracy movement rolling just twoweeks ago.   Also on Tuesday, a cabinet was named to rule the Czech region ofthe country that left Communists in the minority for the first timesince 1948.   This could serve as a model for a new federal government toreplace the 21-member federal Cabinet named on Sunday. Thatgovernment brought in just five non-Communists and left Communistsin control of all key ministries.   The opposition has threatened a general strike on Monday if anew federal government is not named by the weekend.</TEXT></DOC>
