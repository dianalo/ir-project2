Many commodityfund managers follow price trends, so that their purchases onthe heels of rising prices fuel subsequent rallies.</LP><TEXT>   Adding to the slump yesterday was a 30-to-90-day weatherforecast, released after the close of trading Friday, thatpredicted moderate temperatures and normal moisture levelsacross many U.S. growing regions. Some speculators last weekwere buying soybeans on the belief that the forecast wouldcall for hot, dry weather, possibly leading to adrought-induced crop shortage this year and higher cropprices, analysts said.   Soybean futures for July delivery slid 2.5 cents a bushelto close at $6.4850 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.   Export demand and favorable weather forecasts buoyed cornfutures prices slightly. July corn futures gained 0.25 centsa bushel to close at $2.83 a bushel on the Board of Trade.   The outlook for potential frost in certain winter-wheatgrowing regions in coming days sent wheat futures priceshigher. Wheat futures for July delivery advanced 4.75 cents abushel to close at $3.4575 a bushel on the Board of Trade.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          ENERGY: Crude oil contracts were generally higher, thoughtrading was thin ahead of tomorrow's meeting of theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. The marketopened strongly on anticipation that OPEC may agree to cutback its production in May and June. Prices were then knockeddown by waves of selling, before they recovered late in thesession. Crude oil for June delivery actually endedunchanged, at $18.54 a barrel on the New York MercantileExchange, but outer-month contracts finished higher. Julycrude, for instance, wound up seven cents higher, at $19.27 abarrel. Heating oil rallied while spot prices for gasolineplunged, both mainly for technical reasons. The expiring Mayheating oil contract gained 2.79 cents a gallon to 56.53cents. Gasoline for May delivery fell 0.95 cent to 60 cents agallon.                                                                                                          COPPER: Copper for May delivery fell 2.7 cents a pound, tofinish at $1.1690. Futures prices started off weak, recoveredand then settled back again. The April contract had expiredThursday at a very high price because of tight supplies, and&quot;after an expiration like that, there is a tendency for themarket to pause and for prices to sag,&quot; said Robert Green,president of Connecticut Minerals andamp; Metals Inc., a Darien,Conn., metals consulting and trading company. April's finalprice of $1.35 a pound last week was 15 cents a pound abovethe May contract's close, one of the biggest premiums traderscould recall. John Gross, president of J.E. Gross andamp;Associates Inc., a New City, N.Y., consultant to the copperindustry, said that when a spot month expires at a premium,the next month usually rises to pick up the firmness or agood part of it. &quot;That didn't happen this time because theApril premium over May was so large,&quot; he said. Meanwhile inPeru, a miners' and smelter workers' strike continues atSouthern Peru Copper Corp. despite recent indications thatunion and management may be coming closer together, anotheranalyst said. &quot;Management has made offers but none have beenaccepted,&quot; he said. There has been talk that a nationalminers' strike might be called next Monday if the strike atSouthern Peru Copper -- a walkout that began March 12 --isn't settled by then.                                                                                                          PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices rebounded from earlydeclines but ended mixed. June delivery gold was off $2.60 anounce at $371.40. At the day's low in early trading it dippedto $367.70, just 70 cents above its life-of-contract low.July silver ended higher, with a gain of 1.5 cents an ounceat $5.0150, after dropping to a new life-of-contract low of$497.00 (the previous low was $497.70.) July platinumdeclined $1.50 an ounce at $474.10. At one point, Julyplatinum traded as low as $467.00. The early declines inprecious metals appeared to be influenced by active sellingearlier in Europe, according to Ian MacDonald, vicepresident, Credit Suisse, New York. Many European traderswill be observing May Day today. Platinum was weaker thangold mostly because platinum is a thinner market and tends toexaggerate price movements more than gold, Mr. MacDonaldsaid. Gold's rebound was touched off by demand from Europeand the Middle East when the metal dropped to its low for theday, he said: &quot;It was apparent that, as the June gold priceapproached the $366 level, new demand was attracted.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
