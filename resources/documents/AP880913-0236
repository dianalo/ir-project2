HIDLAY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Hugh Hefner, whose name is synonymous withPlayboy magazine, has decided to step down as chairman and chiefexecutive officer of the business empire he launched with a $600investment.   Hefner, 62, issued a statement Monday that he would not run forre-election to the board of directors of Playboy Enterprises Inc.,the magazine's parent company. The directors election is scheduledfollowing Playboy's shareholders' meeting Nov. 10.   Hefner's daughter Christie, who has run the day-to-dayoperations of the company since 1982, is expected to be elected tothe posts now held by her father, the statement said.   The company also revealed it would receive a seven-figureadvance from Bantam Books, Inc., which is publishing Hefner'sautobiography.   Hefner, who mortgaged his furniture and invested $600 of his ownto publish the first issue of Playboy in December 1953, called thechange ``just another evolutionary step consistent with my ownpersonal plans.''   Christie Hefner said in a statement that she hopes to expandPlayboy's licensing, television and video businesses.   ``The geographic reach of the company also will continue to beexpanded,'' she said, ``with new markets such as India and EasternBloc countries opening up for Playboy-licensed products, andforeign distribution of home video and television programsgrowing.''   Ms. Hefner, 35, who over the past six years returned the companyto profitability by selling off its sour businesses, now ispresident, chief operating officer and vice chairwoman of PlayboyEnterprises.   After she becomes Playboy's top board executive, the company'sfounder will remain the major stockholder, with the titles ofchairman emeritus and editor-in-chief of Playboy magazine, thecompany's statement said.   ``Christie has had my full support since she took responsibilityfor the day-to-day operations of the company in April of 1982,''Hefner said in a statement.   Under Ms. Hefner's business direction, Playboy Enterprisesclosed the last of its U.S. key clubs and shed its interests inmovie theaters, modeling and book and record clubs. PlayboyEnterprises made a $2.6 million profit in 1988.   Dan Lee, an analyst with Drexel Burnahm Lambert Inc. in NewYork, speculated Hefner may have stepped down to spend less time onbusiness and more on his fiancee, Kimberley Conrad, 26, Playboy'sPlaymate of the Month for January.   ``In a business sense, Christie Hefner has largely been runningthe company for the past several years. But he owns about 80percent of Playboy's stock, so there won't be any dramaticchanges,'' Lee said.   ``I think in terms of the company overall _ it is a changing ofthe guard, a sort of passing the reins along,'' said Playboyspokeswoman Robyn Radomski.   ``In terms of where the company is now, it's a logical step....But Hef is still going to be editor-in-chief of the magazine andbe involved in major strategic decisions.''</TEXT></DOC>
