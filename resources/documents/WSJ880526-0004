Javier de la Rosa, the KIO's leading business partner in Spain, said Torras soon will raise its stake in Union Explosivos Rio Tinto S.A. to 51% from 24.9% under a debt-repayment plan agreed upon with banks.    Torras also plans to buy food-distribution companies in the U.S. and Britain and paper concerns in Italy, France and Portugal, and to seek technology accords or joint ventures with other chemicals manufacturers, he said.    &quot;Our aim is to create a Spanish company geared to competition within Europe after 1992,&quot; Mr. de la Rosa said. To do this, he said, Torras's shareholders are looking for a combination of improved technology and manufacturing and marketing power. In 1992, trade barriers among the 12 European Community countries are to be dismantled.    In Spain, businesses have been geared to a domestic market that is only now being opened up as a result of EC membership. The Torras project is one of the most ambitious so far to have been publicized by a Spanish concern.    Based in Barcelona, Torras until last year was a little-known paper company with a record of financial difficulties. Last summer, it was taken over by an alliance of the KIO, Mr. de la Rosa and other international investors. Since then, it has been a leading player on Spain's financial scene. Several Dutch-registered companies linked to the KIO own 45% of Torras and Mr. de la Rosa owns 18%. </TEXT></DOC>
