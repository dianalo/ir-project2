The woman was supposed to deliver the pictures and a handwrittenletter bearing hostage Alann Steen's name to an Italian armstrader, Aldo Anghessa, police said. The photographs were of Steen,American reporter Terry Anderson and a third man.   ``Anghessa acted as a go-between, between the two parties. Oneparty was a Lebanese organization,'' said Achille Serra, head ofMilan's anti-terrorist police.   He said the other group was American, but refused to elaborateon the identity of either organization or say if the U.S.government was involved.   The newspaper Il Giornale of Milan reported without attributiontoday that Anghessa was to give the photos and letter to U.S.diplomats, but the arrest of the woman spoiled the operation. TheU.S. Embassy declined comment on the report.   Serra said police do not know if Anghessa was part of an effortto free the hostages, as Italian media has speculated.   Anghessa, who has been linked to Italian and Swiss secretservices and was at the center of an international arms scandallast year, was questioned by police after the woman's arrestThursday after arriving at Milan's Linate Airport from Beirut.Anghessa was released, but police planned to interrogate him again,Serra said.   The Lebanese woman, identified as Aline Ibrahim Rizkallah, 36,was jailed and charged with carrying $1,000 in counterfeit U.S.bills and 50 grams of heroin, police said.   The woman said Anghessa was not connected to the drug shipment,police said.   The Rome daily La Repubblica reported Sunday that Anghessa hadties to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.   A U.S. Embassy spokesman said: ``There is no, repeat no, recordof Anghessa having ever assisted DEA officers in Italy.''   In an interview published in today's edition of the Rome-basednewspaper Il Messaggero, Anghessa was quoted as saying he was``willing to cooperate with this investigation but I swear I knowabsolutely nothing.''   Police were examining the photographs to determine whether theywere originals or copies of newspaper pictures, Serra said.   Serra said police have ruled out that hostage Thomas Sutherlandwas the man in the third photo. The man, who police earlierbelieved to be Sutherland, has not been identified.   Police have asked U.S. authorities for samples of Steen'shandwriting to authenticate the letter bearing his name, saidFortunato Finoli, deputy director of the anti-terrorist police.   Anghessa, 44, who has dual Swiss-Italian nationality, wasarrested following the 1987 seizure of a Lebanese cargo ship offBari in southern Italy. Police said the ship was carrying drugs andweapons for use by the Mafia and Middle East terrorists.   Anghessa was charged with international drug trafficking andorganizing groups for illegal export of weapons and terrorist ends.The charges were later dropped.   The Lebanese woman said she was a courier and denied knowledgeof the photos, letter or other documents written in Italian thatwere hidden in her suitcase, police said.   She told police an Italian man was to receive the photographsand documents. Police traced Anghessa through a telephone number inthe woman's purse, newspapers said.   Authorities were trying to decipher the coded documents, Finolisaid. The letter bearing Steen's name was written in English and``expressed thanks to everyone who was working for hisliberation,'' Finoli said.   Anderson and Sutherland are held by pro-Iranian Islamic Jihad,while Steen's kidnapping was claimed by the Islamic Jihad for theLiberation of Palestine.   In Beirut on Sunday, Islamic Jihad distributed a photo ofAnderson and repeated its demand for the release of its guerrillasfrom all foreign jails and the Israeli pullout from south Lebanonin exchange for the hostages' freedom. It threatened reprisal ifthe demands were not met.   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The AssociatedPress, is the longest-held foreign hostage in Lebanon. He waskidnapped March 16, 1985.   Sutherland, acting dean of agriculture at the AmericanUniversity of Beirut, was abducted three months later. He is ofFort Collins, Colo.   Steen, of Boston, was kidnapped Jan. 24, 1987 at BeirutUniversity College, where he taught.   Nine Americans are held by pro-Iranian extremist factions linkedto Hezbollah, or Party of God. Others believed held are threeBritons, an Irishman and an Italian.</TEXT></DOC>
