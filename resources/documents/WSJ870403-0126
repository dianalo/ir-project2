Ronald Reagan, leaning on American-made semiconductors as his excuse, thereupon began to draw a high protectionist curtain along his country's western coastline.    High-stakes trade retaliation, like Russian roulette, is a dangerous game, and the world doesn't benefit when the president of the United States leads by bad example. The winds of a trade war were hardly calmed, moreover, when U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter yesterday described import restraints as &quot;the H-bomb of trade policy,&quot; and told Congress that &quot;H-bombs ought to be dropped by the president and nobody else.&quot; (These are the people who think Japanese trade official Makoto Kuroda makes tasteless remarks.)    An occasion is now at hand for President Reagan to right his administration's wobbling trade policies. He meets in Ottawa on Sunday and Monday with Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. High on the agenda is a &quot;free-trade agreement&quot; that was proposed by Mr. Mulroney and is now being negotiated by the two countries. We suspect Mr. Reagan is for it. He ought to say so in a big way.    It's true that both countries now do more business with each other than with any other trading partner (including Japan). It's also likely that most Americans think trade already flows back and forth across the border as freely as Californians drive to Vancouver or Canadians to the summer beaches of New Jersey. Not so. Trade between the U.S. and Canada is often difficult. U.S. commodity producers often file complaints against Canadian producers, and the Canadians regularly cite threats to their &quot;culture&quot; as a pretext for erecting barriers against U.S. interests.    Lowering or eliminating trade barriers is worth the effort under any circumstances, but a significant, liberalizing trade agreement between the U.S. and Canada would occur just as the world trading system has reached a critical juncture. Newly developed economies have achieved a level of managerial and engineering skill that is letting them push the more advanced economies of the U.S. and Europe out of labor-intensive markets. Meanwhile the leaders of developing countries are at least recognizing that import substitution and autarky will deprive their citizens of real, sustainable economic improvement.    The problem is that the national leadership of nearly every country involved in this process -- whether it's a Japan, Brazil, Spain, France, Mexico or Turkey -- has to somehow pull free of moribund intellectual traditions or often powerful domestic political constituencies frozen in time. The U.S. and Canada are no exception.    At a time when the world economy badly needs serious leadership, the U.S. Congress contains some of the biggest jingoes since Messrs. Hawley and Smoot. To appease the jingoes, the Reagan administration is now engaged in a volatile strategy of retaliatory brinksmanship with Japan and Europe.    The conservative Mulroney government, despite a series of political problems only Canadians could take seriously, is trying to jolt what is actually a fairly insular, government-dependent nation into taking itself seriously as an international trader. A supply-side revision of the federal tax code is under serious consideration. Quebec province, whose 1970s nationalism threatened to turn a beautiful place into a North American Albania, has made an astonishing intellectual forward leap toward market-driven development. Freer access to the huge U.S. market would speed this important process.    The trade talks will be difficult. They are nonetheless a real chance for the U.S. president to lead the world responsibly in the direction of free trade, and no &quot;buts&quot; about it. </TEXT></DOC>
