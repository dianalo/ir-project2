Last year, Jermaine Cheeseborough was one of a dozenPhiladelphia high school students who traveled together for a monthto Africa and Israel. The message he brought back is that racialintolerance is encouraged when people from different ethnic groupsdon't come into contact with each other.   Wednesday, six black and six Jewish high school students leftPhiladelphia on for a similar trip intended to break down racialstereotypes.   The program, known as ``Operation Understanding,'' was set upsix years ago by Philadelphia's U.S. Rep. William H. Gray III, whois black, and George H. Ross, former chairman of the board of theAmerican Jewish Committee.   The 12 students and two chaperones will spend 12 days in theWest African nations of Senegal and Gambia and 12 days in Israel.They will then visit New York's Harlem and Lower East Side, andMississippi before returning home.   After returning, they'll give talks at high schools, synagoguesand churches.   ``What you are about to experience is one of the mostbreathtaking and awe-inspiring experiences of your life,''Cheeseborough told the youngsters Tuesday night.   Cheeseborough said he attended a predominantly black high schooland until the 1989 trip had little interaction with Jewish people.   ``Now,'' he said, ``I'm awakened.''   In addition to the travel, there was ``another trip going onbetween the students. I gained 11 brothers and sisters. I'm surewe'll remain friends for the rest of our lives,'' he said.   Keith Peltzman, 17, one of the Jewish students who left onWednesday's trip, said there is a ``silent separation'' betweendifferent races at schools across the United States.   Even though many schools are demographically integrated, hesaid, they are not socially integrated.   He said many white students let high school programs onAfrican-American history ``go through one ear and out the other.''   ``What I hope to gain is an understanding of black culture,'' hesaid. ``And I hope to be able to come back to my friends and tellthem about it.''   The $85,000 needed to fund the program for one year was raisedfrom private and public sources. Public and private high schools inPhiladelphia were invited to participate. The schools selected 100applicants initially and that number was narrowed to 12.   As part of the process, applicants had to write essays on theirown and other ethnic groups.   ``They wanted to see how aware we were,'' said Lockie Andrews,16, of Central High School. Ms. Andrews, who is black, was amongthose chosen for the trip this year.   Murray Friedman, the Middle Atlantic States director of theAmerican Jewish Committee, said a similar program is under way inBaltimore. Other cities have also expressed an interest.   At the send-off for the students, Philadelphia Councilman GeorgeBurrell said that as a politician he often faces the problem of``grown adults not communicating with each other.''   ``High school is one of the toughest environments for racerelations in America today,'' he said. ``Take your understandingand try to find a solution to this complex problem.''   Eighteen-year-old Jolie Davis, a 1988 alumna, said the trip hadtaught her to deal with prejudice.   Davis, who is Jewish and just completed her freshman year atBrandeis University, said whenever she hears about prejudiceagainst any racial or ethnic group ``it hurts me.''   ``One of the important things I learned is that everyone hasstereotypes,'' she said, ``and it's important to break them down.''</TEXT></DOC>
