With the Dow Jones Industrial Average still struggling torecover from its 120-point tumble on Nov. 15, a few companieshave withdrawn big planned stock offerings; others have hadto accept lower-than-expected prices to sell shares.</LP><TEXT>   Last week Unisys Corp. scotched a $376 million initialpublic offering of its Paramax defense electronics business.Unisys Chairman James Unruh said the company wanted to avoidselling stock at &quot;fire-sale&quot; prices. And this week, Bank ofNew York Co. withdrew a planned $169.4 million stock sale,citing &quot;adverse market conditions.&quot;   Meanwhile, there are other signs that new-stock fever hascooled. The IPO Reporter, a new-issue newsletter, says themost recent 100 IPOs are trading at a premium of only 9.4%over their offering price, down from a 25% premium in lateSeptember and 18% in mid-November.   But investment bankers say the stock market hasn't beenhit hard enough to deter most companies that want to sellstock. Frederic Seegal, co-head of corporate finance atSalomon Brothers Inc., says, &quot;Market conditions are obviouslysloppy. Investors are slightly more selective, but{companies'} demand for equity isn't abating. A minorcorrection in the market isn't going to stop that.&quot;   The market for new stock issues, which includes both IPOsand stock sales by already-public companies, had already seta record before the mid-November stock market plunge. So farthis year, 734 companies have raised $41.7 billion in stockofferings, according to IDD Information Services. Partly forthat reason, some Wall Street experts believe the market islikely to cool off next year.   &quot;This year's pace of new issues has been aberrational, andit would be hard for it to continue into next year,&quot; saysRobert Kindler, a partner at the law firm Cravath Swaine andamp;Moore. &quot;I think next year is going to be a rude awakening formany people on Wall Street.&quot;   Tom Davis, head of equity transactions for Merrill Lynch andamp;Co., says several factors were converging to slow new issueseven before mid-November, including a heavy calendar of freshstock issues and low cash levels among institutionalinvestors. &quot;The sharp Nov. 15 decline and subsequent sloppytrading brought it all sharply into focus,&quot; he says.   Robert Ewing, an analyst with Fidelity Investments inBoston, says prices for IPOs are coming in at the low end ofthe range announced in offering documents, instead ofexceeding expectations as they did earlier this year.Offering prices now average 93% of their expected level, downfrom 115% in mid-April, he says.   Bank of New York's retreat reflected unlucky timing. Thebank registered its stock offering just one day before theNov. 15 market plunge, when bank stocks were particularlyhard hit by worries that Congress might cap credit-cardinterest rates. Bank of New York's stock had fallen nearly17% before it pulled the deal.   Some companies rushed through offers just after the Nov.15 plunge, including Colgate-Palmolive Co., which sold $400million in stock on Nov. 19, and Burlington Northern Inc.,which sold $321.8 million on Nov. 20. But neither sale was anIPO, which are considered more difficult to price because thestocks lack a trading history.   The most prominent IPO to be priced since the market drop,Stop andamp; Shop Cos., was sold at $12.50 a share, down from ahoped-for $15. And the supermarket concern had to boost thesize of its offer to reach its goal of raising $200 million.Another issuer, General Medical Corp., on Nov. 25 scrapped aplan to raise $112.5 million through an IPO to pay down debt.   Both Stop andamp; Shop and General Medical were so-calledreverse leveraged buy-outs, in which companies that weretaken private with heavy debt loads sell stock to the publicto pay down their debt. Robert Natale, new-issues analyst forStandard andamp; Poor's Corp., says the lowered offering price thatStop andamp; Shop had to accept was a telling sign that investorsaren't comfortable with heavily indebted companies in a soggyeconomy.   Fidelity's Mr. Ewing says he is watching two bellwetherreverse LBOs that still hope to go public this year:Owens-Illinois, which hopes to raise $840 million, andHealthtrust Inc., which plans to raise $600 million beforeyear end.   Some companies that are already public are leery ofselling new shares after seeing their stock prices drop.Shares of Seagull Energy Corp. have fallen 12% since thenatural-gas company announced plans Nov. 8 to sell twomillion shares for about $60 million. &quot;We haven't enjoyedthat,&quot; says Alan Payne, Seagull's director of investorrelations. Mr. Payne says Seagull won't decide until laterthis week whether to go through with its stock sale.   However, investor demand for some stock offerings hasremained strong. Broderbund Software Inc. sold 3.3 millionshares in a Nov. 25 IPO at $11 a share, the high end of theexpected range. The stock later surged to $18. StephenLieber, manager of the Evergreen Fund, says that in a hotstock market Broderbund could have gotten even more for itsstock. &quot;Inevitably,&quot; he says, &quot;investment bankers arereacting to market sentiment and trying to bring deals inmore conservatively&quot; priced.   Underwriters of fast-growing, specialized companies suchas Broderbund say they are not seeing a diminished appetiteamong investors for their offerings. &quot;You can still get dealsdone,&quot; says Kenneth Fitzsimmons, syndicate manager forRobertson Stephens andamp; Co., which co-managed the Broderbundoffering. &quot;The prices may change, but our market still looksgood.&quot;   Others maintain the stock market still represents the mostattractive source of financing for companies that need it. &quot;Ithink the deals are still going to get done, perhaps at alittle lower prices,&quot; says Josiah O. Low III, head ofcorporate finance at Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette SecuritiesCorp. Selling stock &quot;is still the cheapest form offinancing,&quot; he says, &quot;even though it might not be at a level{company executives} would have preferred.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
