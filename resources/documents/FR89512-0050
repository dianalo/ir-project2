The Secretaryof the Interior (Secretary) may open refuge areas to hunting and/or fishingupon a determination that such uses are compatible with the major purpose(s)for which the refuge was established, and that funds are available fordevelopment, operation, and maintenance of a hunting or fishing program.The action must also be in accordance with provisions of all laws applicableto the areas, must be consistent with the principles of sound wildlifemanagement, and must otherwise be in the public interest. This rulemakingproposes to open three refuges to hunting and one to sport fishing. Someof the proposed hunting and fishing programs require refuge-specific huntingor fishing regulations. The DF regulations will be included in a separaterulemaking document on refuge-specific hunting and fishing regulations.Department of the Interior policy is, whenever practicable, to afford thepublic an opportunity to participate in the rulemaking process. It is,therefore, the purpose of this proposed rulemaking to seek public inputregarding the opening of the refuges cited below to migratory game birdhunting, big game hunting, or sport fishing. Accordingly, interested personsmay submit written comments concerning this proposal to the Assistant Director_Refugesand Wildlife (address above) by the end of the comment period. All relevantcomments will be considered by the Department prior to issuance of a finalrule. <ITAG tagnum="84">Conformance With Statutory and Regulatory Authorities </ITAG>The National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act of 1966, as amended(NWRSAA)(16 U.S.C. 668dd), and the Refuge Recreation Act of 1962 (16 U.S.C.460K) govern the administration and public use of national wildlife refuges.Specifically, section 4(d)(1)(A) of the NWRSAA authorizes the Secretaryto permit the use of any area within the Refuge System for any purpose,including but not limited to hunting, fishing, public recreation and accommodations,and access, when he determines that such uses are compatible with the majorpurposes for which each refuge was established. The Service administersthe Refuge System on behalf of the Secretary.The Refuge Recreation Act gives the Secretary additional authority to administerrefuge areas within the Refuge System for public recreation as an appropriateincidental or secondary use only to the extent that it is practicable andnot inconsistent with the primary purposes for which the refuges were established.In addition, prior to opening refuges to hunting or fishing under thisact, the Secretary is required to determine that funds are available forthe development, operation, and maintenance of these permitted forms ofrecreation.In accordance with the NWRSAA and the Refuge Recreation Act, the Secretaryhas determined that the proposed openings for hunting and fishing wouldbe compatible and consistent with the primary purposes for which each ofthe refuges listed below was established, and that funds are availableto administer these programs. The hunting and fishing programs will bewithin State and Federal (migratory game bird) regulatory frameworks. Adiscussion of the compatibility of the hunting and fishing programs withthe purpose(s) for which each refuge was established and the availabilityof funding for each program follows:Lake Ophelia National Wildlife Refuge is being established in east centralLouisiana to preserve wintering habitat for mallards, pintails and woodducks and production habitat for the latter. The refuge is scheduled toencompass about 40,000 acres and will serve as the core of the Three RiversWaterfowl Habitat Conservation Plan, a project initiative of the LowerMississippi River Delta Joint Venture of the North American Waterfowl ManagementPlan. Some 9,500 acres have been acquired to date. Other objectives areto provide and maintain optimum habitat for migratory waterfowl of theMississippi Flyway and endangered species including the Arctic peregrinefalcon and bald eagle, to provide habitat for a natural diversity of wildlifeand plant species and to provide opportunities for wildlife-oriented recreationand environmental education. The proposed sport fishing program has beendesigned to be compatible with and contribute to refuge objectives. Fishnumbers and species are adequate to support the proposed fishing programwhich is estimated to attract some 5,000 visits per year. Refuge regulationswould minimize time and space conflicts. A section 7 consultation underthe Endangered Species Act concluded that the proposed program ``will notaffect'' any species listed. Opening the refuge to fishing would contributeto the attainment of refuge objectives in terms of wildlife-oriented recreation,would be compatible with the purposes for which the refuge was establishedand thus, be in compliance with the NWRSAA. The annual cost to administerthe program is estimated at $5,000 for the first year and $3,000 for subsequentyears. The current annual refuge budget is $47,600 and provides adequatefunds to administer the proposed fishing program. Therefore, opening theLake Ophelia Refuge to sport fishing would be in compliance with the RefugeRecreation Act.Mason Neck National Wildlife Refuge was established in 1959 as the Nation'sfirst bald eagle refuge. Eagles have nested and wintered on the peninsulasince before the 1700's. The refuge currently supports one active nestand 30 to 40 eagles during the winter. The refuge is located in northernVirginia, l8 miles south of Washington, DC, and consists of 2,227 acres.Major objectives are the protection of the bald eagle and its habitat andenvironmental education. It is proposed to open about 485 acres to archerywhite-tailed deer hunting by some 20 hunters per day for a maximum of sixdays and 1,250 acres for shotgun deer hunting by 35 hunters per day fornine days. The objective of the deer hunt is to reduce the population onthe refuge now estimated to be between 185 to 235 deer to a level compatiblewith the biological carrying capacity of the habitat estimated to be from90 to 120 deer. Public use conflicts would be precluded by closing therefuge to all forms of public use on hunt days. A section 7 consultationunder the Endangered Species Act concludes that the proposed hunts ``willnot affect'' any species listed as endangered or threatened. Conflictswith waterfowl populations would be minimal because the areas normallyused by them would not be impacted by the two hunts. The proposed huntswould provide wildlife-oriented recreation, would be compatible with thepurposes for which the refuge was established and thus be in compliancewith the NWRSAA. The annual cost to administer the hunting program is estimatedat $11,750 within an annual budget of $243,l7l. Therefore, the openingof the refuge to white-tailed deer hunting would be in compliance withthe Refuge Recreation Act.Quivera National Wildlife Refuge, located in south-central Kansas, wasestablished in 1955 by authority of the Migratory Bird Conservation Actto provide protection and adequate food, water and resting areas for CentralFlyway waterfowl during their semi-annual migrations. Secondary purposesare to improve nesting habitat for dabbling ducks and to provide an opportunityfor public enjoyment of fish and wildlife resources insofar as populationswarrant and those activities do not interfere with primary objectives.It is proposed to open the refuge to big game hunting for wild turkey,mule deer and white-tailed deer. Present numbers of the species proposedfor hunting are large enough to support the proposed hunting program andprovide for the beneficial use of a renewable resource. Refuge regulationswould limit time and space conflicts. A Section 7 consultation under theEndangered Species Act concluded that the proposed hunts ``will not affect''any species listed as threatened or endangered. Opening the refuge to huntingwould contribute to the attainment of refuge objectives in terms of wildlife-orientedrecreation, would be compatible with the purposes for which the refugewas established and thus be in compliance with the NWRSAA. The annual costto administer the programs is estimated at $1,250 for the first year and$750 for subsequent years. The current annual refuge budget is $299,000and provides adequate funds to administer the proposed hunts. Therefore,opening the Quivera NWR to big game hunting would be in compliance withthe Refuge Recreation Act. Trustom Pond National Wildlife Refuge, located in southern Rhode Islandwas established in 1974 through a 365 acre donation and several purchasesfor a total of 641 acres. The primary objective of the Refuge is ``to preserve,restore, and enhance in their natural ecosystem (when practicable) allspecies of animals and plants that are endangered or threatened with becomingendangered.'' To that end, a Section 7 evaluation under the U.S. EndangeredSpecies Act was conducted to determine the extent, if any, that the proposedhunting program might affect endangered or threatened species. The evaluationfound that the proposed hunt ``will not affect'' listed species. The huntingarea consists of one 52 acre parcel on which at different times eitherone goose hunting party or not more than 12 dove hunters would be allowedto hunt. This would be an extremely high quality hunt in an area of verylimited hunting opportunity, would be compatible with refuge objectivesin providing high quality recreational experiences and thus be in compliancewith the NWRSAA. There is virtually no public use on the area proposedfor hunting. However, to avoid possible conflicts with the public the huntingarea would be closed, except to hunters during the open hunting season.The annual cost to administer the program is estimated at $2,700. The currentannual budget is $357,000 and provides adequate funds to administer theproposed hunts. Therefore, opening the Trustom Pond NWR to dove and migratorybird hunting would be in compliance with the Refuge Recreation Act. <ITAG tagnum="84">Economic Effect </ITAG>Executive Order 12291, ``Federal Regulation,'' of February 17, 1981, requiresthe preparation of regulatory impact analyses for major rules. A majorrule is one likely to result in an annual effect on the economy of $100million or more; a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individualindustries, government agencies or geographic regions; or significant adverseeffects on the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete withforeign-based enterprises. The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C.601, <T3>et seq.</T3>) further requires the preparation of flexibility analysesfor rules that will have a significant effect on a substantial number ofsmall entities, which include small businesses, organizations or governmentaljurisdictions. It is estimated that the proposed opening of these refuges to hunting andfishing will generate approximately 6,650 annual visits. Using data fromthe 1980 National Survey of Hunting, Fishing, and Wildlife-Associated Recreation,and the 1988 Economic Report of the President (Consumer Price Index), totalannual receipts generated from purchases of food, transportation, huntingequipment, fishing gear, fees, and licenses associated with these programsare expected to be approximately $199,533, or substantially less than $100million. In addition, since these estimated receipts will be spread overfour states, the implementation of this rule should not have a significanteconomic impact on the overall economy, or a particular region, industry,or group of industries, or level of government. With respect to small entities, this rule would have a positive aggregateeconomic effect on small businesses, organizations, and governmental jurisdictions.The proposed openings would provide recreational opportunities and generateeconomic benefits that would not otherwise exist, and will impose no newcosts on small entities. While the number of small entities likely to beaffected is not known, the number is judged to be small. Moreover, theadded cost to the Federal government of law enforcement, posting, etc.,needed to implement activities under this rule would be considerably lessthan the income generated from the implementation of these hunting and/orsport fishing programs.Accordingly, the Department of the Interior has determined that this ruleis not a ``major rule'' within the meaning of Executive Order 12291 andwould not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number ofsmall entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. <ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act </ITAG>This rule does not contain information collection requirements which requireapproval by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501, <T3>et seq.</T3> <ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Considerations </ITAG>Pursuant to the requirements of section 102(2)(C) of the National EnvironmentalPolicy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)), environmental assessments havebeen prepared for these proposed openings. Section 7 evaluations have beenprepared pursuant to the Endangered Species Act.
