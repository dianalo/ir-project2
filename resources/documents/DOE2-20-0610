Closeness to a transition to an inhomogeneous state(charge-density or spin-density wave) always leads to the appearanceof an effective attraction between electrons irrespective of the specificelectron-fluid model considered. As an example, attention is given toan isotropic electron fluid on a static positive background near thetransition to a state with a charge-density wave. 7 references.</TEXT></DOC>
