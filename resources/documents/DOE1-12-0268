In the presence of an excessof bromine or nickel(II), oxidation is monophasic, and the initial productis [Ni/sup IV/L]{sup 2+}, a formal nickel(IV) species that undergoessubsequent reactions to give an unknown oxidation product with excessbromine at pH andgt; 6 or to give [Ni/sup III/L]{sup +} by comproportionationwith excess nickel(II) at pH andgt; 5. The sole kinetically important oxidantis Br{sub 2}, and second-order rate constants for reaction of [Ni/supII/L] and its protonated form [Ni/sup II/LH]{sup +} are 2.1 x 10{sup7} and 7.1 x 10{sup 5} M{sup -1} s{sup -1}, respectively. These rateconstants are in line with a rate-determining single-electron-transferreaction, and the proposed mechanism involves formation of a transiention pair [Ni/sup III/L{sup +},Br{sub 2}{sup -} in which the rate of subsequentelectron transfer is comparable with the rate of ion-pair dissociation.In addition, the pulse-radiolysis technique has been used to investigatethe reactions of nickel(II) with Br{sub 2}{sup -} to give [Ni/sup III/L]{sup+}, and rate constants for [Ni/sup II/L] and [Ni/sup II/LH]{sup +} are8.5 x 10{sup 8} and 2.7 x 10{sup 8} M{sup -1} S{sup -1}, respectively,at 21{sup 0}C. 34 references, 3 figures, 3 tables.</TEXT></DOC>
