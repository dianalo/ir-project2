Death was rarely that fussy duringthe remainder of this feisty French peasant's life: Hermother was killed by lightning when Carles was four; onebrother died of starvation in a German prisoner-of-war campon Armistice Day, 1918; another fell into a well and smashedhis brains; a sister died in labor at 22; and her firstbornchild was killed by a truck at age six. Add to that a coupleof sisters who perished on the operating table and two uncleswho slit their own throats, and you have the makings of whatwould appear to be a fairly depressing book.   But &quot;A Life of Her Own&quot; is not depressing at all. Writtenat the age of 77 -- two years before her death in 1979 -- bya rural French schoolteacher who spent almost her entire lifein the tiny village of Val-des-Pres in the Alps, it is avibrant, uplifting account of a tough, independent woman'slife in a world that has always been tough on independentwomen. It is also a personal hymn to a France that exists nomore: the &quot;French Appalachia&quot; tourists discovered after WorldWar II.</LP><TEXT>   In fact, Carles wrote this best-selling memoir after shehad become quite a personage because of protests sheorganized to keep her beloved Claree Valley from being cut toribbons by superhighways.   Carles was born into a brutal, Darwinian world where life,particularly a child's, had little value. &quot;It was one oflife's accidents, not the kind of thing that makes the worldstand still,&quot; she says of her nearly fatal plunge from a loftto a hard threshing floor. My father &quot;didn't say `call thedoctor' or anything else, although my weeping sisters did notknow what to do; he just said: `Take care of her, putcompresses on her head. I've got to get moving.'   &quot;Rose, the eldest, not knowing where to turn, asked:`What'll happen to us if our little sister dies?'   &quot; `If she dies,' my father answered, `go ask the carpenterto make a coffin, and we'll bury her when I get back.' &quot;   In the same matter-of-fact tone she describes how sheweathered poverty, ignorance, sexism and the casual crueltyof peasant life; Kaiser Wilhelm, the Wehrmacht and theGestapo. During World War II, the Nazis had a policy ofshooting nine hostages for every German killed by Frenchpartisans, and Carles's pacifist husband, Jean, was the&quot;designated hostage&quot; from their village. He hightailed it outof town early in the war and stayed on the run until theliberation.   Yet all this gloom is leavened by Carles's passion for herhomeland, her delight in teaching, her lifelong commitment tosometimes-quixotic causes, and her devotion to her children-- two of her own, plus the four she adopted after hersister's death. Rattling off charming tales of sheepsmugglers, wolf attacks, rural larceny, duped bureaucrats andthe types of decade-spanning grudges that farmers are famousfor, Carles tells an absorbing tale of ordinary heroism inthe language of an ordinary person. It is a reviewer'sdelight: a book that actually originated in somebody's head,instead of being hatched at a blue-sky session on 57th Streetattended by six editors, three agents and two honchos fromthe market-research department.   Carles's book has been given a fine translation by AvrielH. Goldberger, chairwoman of the French department at HofstraUniversity, who aggressively oversells the book as a feministtract in her introduction, ignoring Carles's enormousaffection for her father, her own intellectual debt to herhusband, and statements such as, &quot;If I hadn't been a teacher,I would have been a washerwoman. Washing and especiallyrinsing have always seemed wonderful to me.&quot;   Drawing gratuitous connections to her own life, Ms.Goldberger explains she was initially attracted to Carles'smemoir because it made her remember how, as a child inPhiladelphia with &quot;her nose always in a book,&quot; she &quot;longed tobreak free of the iron-clad cycle of the female life shewitnessed.&quot; Personally, I don't see what a littlePhiladelphia bookworm has in common with a dirt-poor Frenchpeasant who survived disease, hunger, poverty, nonstoppersonal tragedy, savage Alpine winters, a very severe headwound and the Nazis.   ---   It would be unfair to compare this epic with Peter Mayle'sslight &quot;Toujours Provence&quot; (Knopf, 241 pages, $20). But it isnot unfair to compare it with Mr. Mayle's previous book, &quot;AYear in Provence.&quot; There, the retired American advertisingexecutive recounted his first year in one of France's mostglorious regions, delighting readers with tales of boarhunters, truffle-seeking pigs, cheapskate German tourists andlong lunches. An affable sybarite and a graceful writer, Mr.Mayle painted a seductive portrait of a life that many of uswould be quite willing to lead -- one that basically seems toconsist of eating and drinking.   &quot;Toujours Provence&quot; has the same Eisenhower-era detachmentfrom contemporary life, but the kindest thing that can besaid about it is that it isn't very good. He clearly didn'thave enough new material for a new book, and relies onsecond-rate truffle-smuggling stories, bathroom humor andpointless accounts of Luciano Pavarotti concerts. Hisinsistent portrayal of the French as a race of daffy epicuresis wearing thin in Provence II, as is his annoyingly literaltranslations of French conversations. It's time for Mr. Mayleto take French leave.</TEXT></DOC>
