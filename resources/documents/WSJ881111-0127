Yang (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> BIO </IN><G> CNG </G><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Rep. Henry Gonzalez, the man in line to be the House Banking Committee chairman, is a fiery Texas populist who fights his battles hard -- in more ways than one.    If, as expected, House Democrats select him next month to succeed Rep. Fernand St Germain, the 14-term Rhode Island lawmaker who was defeated Tuesday, Mr. Gonzalez said he'll turn those energies toward trying to stabilize the nation's beleaguered savings-and-loan industry and revamping the financial-services industry.    At first glance, Mr. Gonzalez seems an unlikely candidate to lead such an important committee. His 26-year House career has been distinguished more by unusual events -- including punching a GOP colleague who called his voting record &quot;left-leaning&quot; -- than by legislative achievements. In addition, he's likely to be challenged by committee members who advocate deregulating the banking industry faster than he has favored.    While banking lobbyists were cheered by the defeat of Rep. St Germain, who had opposed allowing banks to broaden their activities, they fear that the committee wouldn't produce major banking legislation under Mr. Gonzalez's leadership.    Nevertheless, Mr. Gonzalez is backed by the House Democratic leadership, including Speaker James Wright, a fellow Texan, and many senior Democrats on the banking panel. And House Democrats could find it difficult to reject one of the few senior Hispanics in Congress.    In a comment that could help defuse possible opposition to his chairmanship, Mr. Gonzalez said he would make expanded securities-underwriting powers for banks a priority for the committee. &quot;The securities industry is heavily involved in traditional banking services,&quot; he said in a telephone interview from his San Antonio home. &quot;We've got to level out that playing field.&quot;    Mr. Gonzalez's ascension would place even more power over savings-and-loan regulation in the hands of lawmakers and government officials from Texas, where the thrifts are reeling from the state's real estate collapse.    He has proposed allowing the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. to borrow $50 billion from the Treasury to quickly close or merge insolvent thrifts and recoup the money by selling the institutions' repossessed assets. While the thrift industry generally favors the idea, it doesn't have much support among lawmakers.    As Banking Committee chairman, Mr. Gonzalez would be one of the fiercest critics of the Federal Reserve Board since another populist Texan, the late Rep. Wright Patman, wielded the committee's gavel. In the past, Rep. Gonzalez has introduced resolutions to impeach Fed governors and has tried to place greater congressional control on the Fed. &quot;We shouldn't have such an embedded, self-perpetuating group in power dictating the monetary and fiscal policy,&quot; he said yesterday.    &quot;The Fed is in for some heavy sledding,&quot; said Kenneth Guenther, a bank lobbyist and a former aide to the late Fed Chairman Arthur Burns.    In Congress, though, Rep. Gonzalez is better known for his eccentric behavior than his views on banking matters. Two years ago in a San Antonio bar, he punched a man who had called him a communist. He has twice introduced resolutions to impeach President Reagan and once called Housing and Urban Development Secretary Samuel Pierce, who is black, &quot;a Step'n Fechit.&quot; Mr. Pierce responded by saying that he thought Mr. Gonzalez was &quot;ready for the funny farm.&quot;    Rep. Gonzalez's previous experience as a committee chairman wasn't impressive. Selected in 1977 to head a celebrated special committee to renew the inquiries into the assassinations of John Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr., he got into a feud with the panel's counsel and tried to fire him, only to have the rest of the committee fail to back him up.    After a brief period incommunicado at his San Antonio home, Mr. Gonzalez resigned from the committee. Back in Washington, he sought to explain his actions in a series of bitter speeches on the floor of the House and in a letter to his colleagues.    As chairman of the House Banking subcommittee on housing, Rep. Gonzalez has been an ardent defender of many federal housing programs President Reagan has sought to cut. But it took him six years as head of the subcommittee before any new housing legislation was enacted. </TEXT></DOC>
