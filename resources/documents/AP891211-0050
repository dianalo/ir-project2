Israeli wants the new assurances before Foreign Minister MosheArens agrees to attend a preliminary meeting in Washington expectedto work out a Palestinian delegation to the first direct talks withIsraeli representatives, officials said.   In the occupied lands, meanwhile, soldiers today shot andwounded seven Palestinians in clashes with stone-throwing youths,Arab reports said.   The confrontations were touched off by the fatal shootings oftwo Palestinians Sunday, apparently by Israeli civilians who openedfire after attacks on their vehicles by stone-throwers, Israeli andArab reports said.   A total of 631 Palestinians have been killed by Israelis duringthe 2-year-old uprising against Israeli rule in the West Bank andGaza Strip. At least 155 other Palestinians have been killed byfellow Arabs as alleged collaborators with Israel. Forty-threeIsraelis also have died.   The army also said troops on Sunday night demolished the homesof three suspects in the slaying of an alleged Palestiniancollaborator with Israel.   In comments on army radio, Foreign Minister Moshe Arens said hestill was suspicious that Egypt was indirectly representing thePalestine Liberation Organization. ``If this is what will be, Ifear that we won't get very far,'' Arens said.   Arens had planned a trip to Washington next month for a meetingwith U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Egypt's foreignminister, Esmat Abdel-Meguid.   Asked about the Washington trip today, Arens said, ``Firstly,I'm not going yet. We will first conduct contacts concerning theguarantees that our Cabinet has asked.''   Avi Pazner, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's spokesman, saidCabinet Secretary Eliakim Rubinstein would go to Washington laterthis week to discuss the promise sought by Israel.   Israel had asked U.S. guarantees against any PLO role last monthin its acceptance of Baker's proposal for the Washington meeting.   The latest possible obstacle to talks followed weekend newsreports that secret contacts already were under way among Israeli,Egyptian, American and Palestinian officials to draw up a list ofPalestinian negotiators.   A PLO spokesman in Cairo, Said Kamal, was quoted in the YediotAhronot daily today as saying the organization had been asked todraw up three lists of names for presentation to the Israelis.   On Sunday, the newspaper listed some of the Palestinians underconsideration as east Jerusalem activist Faisal Husseini,journalist and union leader Radwan Abu Ayyash, newspaper editorHannah Siniora, and Assad Saftawi, a school principle in Gaza City.   Saftawi confirmed the reported behind-the-scenes contacts to TheAssociated Press and said he was heading to Cairo for talks on thesubject.   But Pazner denied the report, saying the contacts had notreached the stage of putting together a list of negotiators.</TEXT></DOC>
