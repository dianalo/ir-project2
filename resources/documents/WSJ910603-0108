Bargainers agreed to continue talking while keeping ineffect the terms of the old contract, which expired at 12:01a.m. EST Saturday. A recent vote of the 18,000 Teamsters whowork for auto-carrying companies granted the union authorityto call a strike, but no walkout has been set, the unionsaid.</LP><TEXT>   Talks are scheduled to resume Wednesday, and protractednegotiations are likely, a Teamsters official said. A leadingissue involves moves by Ryder Systems and otherauto-transporting trucking companies to &quot;double breast,&quot; orcreate a second, non-Teamsters or nonunion operation that theunion says siphons work from Teamsters-driven trucks.   The union has sought to get double-breasting banned inprevious contracts, but officials say car-hauling companiesare violating those provisions. In 1988, the union and carhaulers agreed to a three-year pact after Teamsters membersrejected an earlier tentative settlement, which containedsubstantial pay concessions by the union.</TEXT></DOC>
