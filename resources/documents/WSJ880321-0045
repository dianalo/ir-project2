The informal accord didn't include the limits the U.S. is seeking on much-larger government outlays for research and development of new aircraft. Nonetheless, there were signs that the U.S. was growing less impatient with the jetliner consortium and the governments funding it.    &quot;This is a significant first step,&quot; U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said. &quot;But it leaves a long way yet to go.&quot; He added that the two sides &quot;seem to have plateaued&quot; and that he and the Airbus ministers meeting here Friday didn't try to move the talks onto a &quot;higher plateau.&quot;    The U.S has been pressuring the four Airbus nations for nearly three years to abolish or reduce subsidies and to force Airbus to show more restraint in its sales and pricing practices and to make its financing arrangements more visible. As recently as last fall, the U.S. was threatening a trade war if its demands weren't met.    Willy de Clercq, the European Community's commissioner for external relations, put a more positive face on the meeting even while maintaining that the Airbus-sponsoring governments &quot;cannot entirely renounce&quot; state aid. Mr. de Clercq said the two sides were &quot;close&quot; to agreeing on rules on sales inducements and policies and were &quot;closer&quot; than before on the need to prove the commercial viability of a proposed aircraft program if the program is to receive subsidies. But the ministers will have to meet again on several &quot;difficult issues,&quot; such as the terms of government support, Mr. de Clercq said.    A meeting will be held in Paris in May during an assembly of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.    Despite impatience over the slow progress of the talks, U.S. officials apparently have decided on a softer approach.    The threat of protectionist trade measures in the U.S. and the absence of recent Airbus sales in the U.S. have helped calm the U.S. team, negotiators say. Furthermore, a recent directive by the four Airbus ministers to have Airbus managers enter serious negotiations with St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas Corp. on possible joint projects also is softening tensions, officials on both sides said.    None of this has been lost on the Europeans. &quot;There is a new tone in the talks,&quot; said one French official at the meeting.    Airbus is a grouping of Aerospatiale of France, Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm G.m.b.H. of West Germany, British Aerospace PLC and Construcciones Aeronauticas S.A. of Spain. </TEXT></DOC>
