Mr. Fields, who worked at FirstBoston Corp., asked his boss, a woman, for the same threemonths of paid child-care leave that she herself had receiveda few months earlier.   She said no. He appealed to her boss. He said no. Mr.Fields pointed out that it was probably illegal to deny anexpectant father benefits that expectant mothers got. &quot;Theysaid there was nothing they could do about it,&quot; recalls Mr.Fields, who later quit for a job elsewhere. &quot;It was anunwritten rule that leave was at a manager's discretion andit didn't apply to men.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   As the problem of child care for working parents continuesto fester, employers' selective flexibility is creating a newcaste system. Favored employees are able to cut deals theircolleagues can't, breeding uniquely sharp, and mostly hidden,resentments. Mr. Fields's experience was typical in that itbegan in uncertainty and ended in bitterness; it was unusualonly in that he spoke up about it.   The covert conflict pits men against women, mothersagainst other mothers, professional women againstnonprofessionals and children's needs against those ofemployers. &quot;It's a new kind of class structure,&quot; says ArleneJohnson, program director for work-force research at theConference Board, a business research group in New York.&quot;Instead of `What side of the tracks did you grow up on?'it'll be `Did your family work for a family-supportivecompany?'&quot;   The family-leave bill mandating unpaid leave for mostworkers would begin to even things out. But President Bushhas threatened to veto the bill if the House, as expected,passes it in the next few weeks. Businesses, lobbying heavilyagainst it, argue that the bill infringes on theirflexibility to plan for their own labor needs.   But corporate attorneys warn that just as employers oftenfailed to establish policies protecting themselves againstsexual harassment charges, they now are failing to recognizethe legal pitfalls of giving benefits to the few. &quot;The wholeatmosphere is ripe for claims against companies that haveflexible arrangements&quot; for only some employees, says JosephDeGiuseppe Jr., a lawyer at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher andamp;Flom in New York. &quot;You can't say female employees withchildren can work on a flexible arrangement, but if you'reJewish and want to leave early on Friday you can't do it.&quot;   Last year a federal appeals court in Pittsburgh ruled thatthe board of education there illegally discriminated againsta male teacher in 1981 by refusing him a one-year parentalleave offered to women. The Equal Employment OpportunityCommission cited the case in December when it issued newpolicy guidelines stating that employers offering leave tomothers must offer the same leave to fathers. &quot;This issue isjust coming to the forefront now,&quot; says a spokeswoman for thecommission.   For now, employees who lose out in the corporatechild-care sweepstakes are seething rather than suing. Mr.Fields, who worked in First Boston's information systemsdivision, says he considered legal action but decided itwasn't worth jeopardizing his job. First Boston says itdoesn't have a paternity policy; fathers can ask for anunpaid personal leave, but that has to be negotiated with theemployee's manager. While not all mothers get paid,three-month leaves, the firm says, a woman would get such aleave under the firm's disability policy if a doctor'sopinion required it.   When Laurel Stemper, a 40-year-old insurance broker inAtlanta, took a 12-week pregnancy leave from Garlington GroupInc. in 1989, she assumed her job was secure because anotherwoman had taken such a leave. Two weeks after her return, herboss said the company was eliminating her position. Herresponsibilities went to a woman past childbearing age whohad filled in for her.   She complained to the EEOC, but decided not to file aclaim. &quot;I didn't want to be blackballed in the industry,&quot; shesays. &quot;I needed to find another job.&quot; Garlington declines tocomment.   &quot;A lot of females are afraid,&quot; says a human-resources vicepresident at a regional bank who asks that her name and heremployer's not be given. &quot;They have worked so hard to get toa point that they don't want to jeopardize it.&quot; This woman'scolleague adds, &quot;We have a woman CEO, but she avoids theissue because she's one of the few women in an all-maleworld.&quot;   Some women are so nervous that they try to appearbiologically correct at all times. One analyst at a New Yorksecurities firm says she timed things so she wouldn't appearpregnant during performance reviews in October and wouldn'tgive birth until after bonus time in January. A woman in ajob-sharing program at Steelcase Inc. says she keeps picturesof her children off her desk.   Many companies say their case-by-case approach to childcare is the fairest, most efficient way to handle dual-careerparents. Poor performers and easily replaceable employees,they say, shouldn't get special child-care arrangements.   &quot;It has to be to the benefit of shareholders, or youaren't going to do it,&quot; says William B. Harrison, 48, aChemical Bank vice chairman who has approved innovativejob-sharing arrangements for some high-ranking womenexecutives. With no formal policy, Chemical approves flexiblework schedules on a case-by-case basis. To the extent thatchildren of more adept employees benefit, says Royall VictorIII, 52, a managing director, &quot;then I would say thosechildren are particularly lucky to be the children ofcreative, ambitious parents. We don't all come out of acookie cutter.&quot;   Winning benefits -- particularly the coveted perk offlexible hours -- has become a delicate, stealthy art, playedbest by working parents in positions of power. Private dealsthat don't remain so can easily be blown apart by co-workersresentful of special treatment.   When Kim Samara, 36, took maternity leave fromHewlett-Packard Co. in 1986, she thought she had an agreementto return, working two days a week in the office and one athome. When she came back, she was working for a younger womannew in her job in a group with two other, still-youngerwomen.   After six months, her co-workers complained about thearrangement. Ellen Eisner, 34, one former co-worker, saysthat if Ms. Samara was caring for her baby at home, why wasshe being paid to work? And if she was working, why wasn'tshe in the office? &quot;You're either working eight hours a dayor you're taking care of children,&quot; says Ms. Eisner, who isunmarried. &quot;I would love to work one day at home. It wasn'tan option open to me.&quot;   After months of talks, Ms. Samara was told she had to workfull time. She quit, feeling bitter toward the company andher colleagues. But she and Ms. Eisner both think much of thefault rests with Hewlett-Packard; because it didn't have astandard policy, Ms. Samara says, &quot;you were totally at themercy of your manager. If your manager felt secure and wouldstick their neck out for you, you were okay.&quot;   Julie Kertzman, Ms. Samara's former supervisor, says sheasked Ms. Samara to come back full time not because ofresentment among other subordinates but because the position,product management, demanded it. &quot;There are some situationswhere {part time} is feasible and some where, based on thebusiness need, it isn't,&quot; she says. &quot;And you have to bereally honest about that.&quot;   Just as top managers get more stock options and niceroffices, they get better child-care deals than the workingclass. One company supplying child care even has a division-- called ExecuTots -- catering to professionals. &quot;You aretalking about two different worlds,&quot; says Claire Lifshitz,the office manager for a local of the Oil, Chemical andamp; AtomicWorkers International Union. &quot;In factory work, once you punchyour time card, your children don't exist. If you have a sickchild, you don't go in, and you don't get paid for that day.If that happens too often, you are out of work.&quot;   Merck andamp; Co. provided seed money for a day-care center morethan 10 years ago after a woman scientist threatened toresign, but tuition at the center, in Rahway, N.J., is about$680 a month. Professionals can afford that; secretariescan't. Only now, as Merck plans the construction of two newchild-care centers, is the company considering subsidies forits lower-paid employees.   &quot;We do feel we would like to have the centers accessibleto employees at all levels and not really be favoring onlythe professionals,&quot; says Richard Parker, director of humanresource administrative services at Merck. &quot;We would rathernot say we have one class of employee that is more valuableto us than another.&quot;   Even companies with formal child-care policies find thatmanagers aren't always keen on implementing them. NCNB Corp.says its supervisors fall into three categories: those whoaggressively promote work-family benefits, those who makedeals for a few subordinates, and those who ignore the wholeissue. &quot;There can be resentment when employees hear acorporate message that's different from the reality,&quot; saysKaren Geiger, the bank's career development director.&quot;Typically, someone will call me anonymously and say, `I amgetting the impression that this isn't okay here.' Then Iwill talk to that manager and see if I can work somethingout.&quot;   NCNB is unusual in having its human-resources departmentact as an ombudsman in such cases. More typically, evendiscussing child-care issues at work is freighted withpotential for embarrassment, censure and career-limitingexposure. A woman who declined to be interviewed for thisarticle was so nervous about the topic that she later wrotethis cordial note:   &quot;As you know, upon consideration of your request, I havedecided not to discuss my personal experience or my views onthe subject. Naturally, this also means that I do not wantany reference made to myself or the company for which I work,including the fact that I have declined to participate inyour research. . . .&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
