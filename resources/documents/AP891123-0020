While avoiding direct comment on the ethics problems of fiveSenate colleagues, Mitchell said merely questioning lawmakers'standard of conduct is insufficient.   ``There isn't any clearly established line'' on what services asenator should or should not provide to constituents and politicaldonors, the Maine Democrat told reporters during an end-of-sessioninterview Wednesday.   Mitchell was questioned in connection with an ethics committeeprobe into five senators' intervention with federal regulators onbehalf of Lincoln Savings and Loan Association. Lincoln's collapseis expected to become the nation's largest Sandamp;L failure at a cost ofup to $2.5 billion.   The five _ Sens. Alan Cranston, D-Calif.; Dennis DeConcini,D-Ariz.; John McCain, R-Ariz.; John Glenn, D-Ohio, and Donald W.Riegle Jr., D-Mich. _ received or solicited a total of $1.3 millionin political contributions from Lincoln's owner, Phoenixmillionaire Charles H. Keating Jr.   All five have told the ethics committee they violated no laws orSenate rules and have denied charges that their meetings in April1987 with regulators on behalf of Lincoln were improper.   Mitchell said all lawmakers are vulnerable to accusations ofconflict of interest because they can be seen as beholden to peoplewho helped them get elected. He said he plans to push early nextyear for a review of Senate ethical guidelines, which he said aremore vague than those in the House.   But he also said focusing solely on ethics rules is ``treatingthe symptom, not the cause.''   ``We have to change the method, the system, by which we electpublic officials in our society and by which we finance and conductcampaigns,'' he said. In doing so, Mitchell restated his past callfor public financing of congressional campaigns.   Mitchell said there is built-in conflict because members of theHouse and Senate know they're expected to ``bring home the bacon''for their constituents, whether it involves saving a military baseor getting a new federal building opened.   But he said he was not optimistic about the prospects ofachieving major campaign finance changes when the 101st Congressconvenes for its second session Jan. 23.   ``This system is demeaning for everybody. It's not a good system... The Republicans have got a big advantage and they don't want togive up that advantage,'' he said. ``That's the single direct fact.I think it really is in their interest to change it.''   Mitchell was referring to the Republican Party's historicalability to eclipse the Democrats in raising money from thewealthiest donors.   ``The fact of the matter is that voters like and reward _ in theform of approval at the polls _ people who they think areaggressively representing them,'' he said. ``We've developed awhole colloquial language about it: `Bring home the bacon.'''</TEXT></DOC>
