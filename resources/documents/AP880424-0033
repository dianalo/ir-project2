U.S. officials so far have refused to issue the company thenecessary license, saying that the system would violate a six-yearban on the sale of ``cluster bomb'' technology to Israel.   The company's lobbying effort is outlined in a Feb. 4 memo fromUnited Technologies to Edward Derwinski, under secretary of statefor security assistance, science and technology. Defense Week, aWashington publication, reports in its issue dated Monday that topIsraeli officials also have been lobbying for the UTC license.   In the memo from C.R. Bergwin, director of export licenseadministration for Hartford, Conn.-based United Technologies, thecompany argues that the ban should not apply to the $50 millioncontract.   ``In order that we may proceed with the program, we urgentlyrequire an interpretation that the U.S. government's clustermunition policy does not apply to our contract,'' Bergwin wrote.   He said the company believes that the 1982 ban was aimed atcluster bombs designed to be used against people, not against tanksand armored vehicles.   Bergwin also argued that the United Technologies contract shouldnot be subject to the ban because ``our limited engineeringparticipation in this program'' has nothing to do with the warheadportion of the system.   Israel hired the company to design the nose, wing and controlmodules of the weapon system. The contract was under UTC's NordenSystems in Norwalk, Conn., but has been transferred to thecorporation's Advanced Systems Division in San Diego, a source toldThe Associated Press.   The White House imposed the cluster bomb ban on Israel in 1982after evidence surfaced that the devices were used by Israelagainst civilians during its invasion of Lebanon, an apparentviolation of assurances Israel had previously given U.S. officials.   But Israeli officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity,told Defense Week that the proposed weapon was much different froma traditional cluster bomb.   Conventional cluster bombs spread scores of ``bomblets''indiscriminately, while the weapon under development would dispenseno more than 10 submunitions that would seek out individual armortargets such as tanks, they said.   But tank-seeking weapons that miss their primary target ``don'tturn into potted plants,'' one Pentagon official told Defense Week.``They sense large metal objects like school buses and can causecivilian casualties.''   The newsletter said U.S. officials likely would approve theexport permit if Israel signs a proposal submitted two years ago bythe State Department that would detail how Israel could use suchweapons. But Israel does not want to sign the agreement.   A State Department spokeswoman reached over the weekend declinedcomment.   United Technologies said in a prepared statement: ``It's aclassified Israeli program, and therefore we cannot comment.''</TEXT></DOC>
