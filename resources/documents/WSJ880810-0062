Meanwhile, senior police and justice officials from France, Switzerland and West Germany met in Paris yesterday to coordinate their investigation into the so-called boiler-room operation. French investigators said it is hoped that yesterday's consultation will lead to additional arrests, but they declined to give any details.    Apart from the arrests by French authorities, two suspected leaders of the operation are being held in Switzerland, while another three have been arrested in West Germany.    French investigators said 18 suspected organizers and accomplices were detained in three simultaneous raids at the end of July in eastern and southern France. Six of those have been charged with fraud and illegal canvassing, one is being kept in custody pending further investigation and 11 others have been released but may be charged later as accomplices, according to a police detective familiar with the case.    A French magistrate identified the six who have been charged as Thomas Quinn and his wife, Rochelle Rothfleisch, both U.S. citizens; Dominick Di Mare, also a U.S. citizen; Gary William Reid, a Canadian; Carl Davis of the United Kingdom; and Nazeer Hussein Aziz Moosa, who carries an Indian passport.    Investigators said police seized a substantial quantity of documents when they raided one suspected boiler-room operation at Fernay Voltaire, in the Ain region of France that borders Switzerland, as well as at the villa of Mr. Quinn and Ms. Rothfleisch at Mougins, near Cannes in southern France.    One investigator commented that the organization of the alleged network was &quot;amazingly intricate and worthy of any multinational corporation.&quot; He said he was optimistic that most of the loose ends of the affair would be tied up by the end of the year. </TEXT></DOC>
