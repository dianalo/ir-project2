<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-03-0673 </DOCNO><TEXT>We discuss the asymmetric double Langmuir probe (ADLP) and demonstratethe possibility of using it to measure plasma temperature T/sub e/ anddensity n when it is operated in the region of small signal response.The area of one of the ADLP collectors is considerably larger than theother. This probe can be operated at a relatively low applied voltage,eV/sub a/T/sub e/ andless; 1, and still provides sufficient information to determinethe plasma T/sub e/ and n. There is no need for a direct measurementof the ion saturation current, which can be on the order of a few amperesin large fusion devices. This reduces the requirements on the probe powersupply. 6 refs., 6 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
