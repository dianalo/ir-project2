The subsidiary of Motorola Inc. of the U.S. this weekreplaced its American president with a Japanese executive,Isamu Kuru, who was hired away last year from Toshiba Corp.Mr. Kuru, 51 years old, was a lifelong Toshiba semiconductorexecutive until December, when he took the unusual step for aJapanese executive of jumping ship to Motorola as vicepresident and managing director.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Kuru succeeded Rick Younts, 51, who is expected toreturn to the U.S. later this year.   Four years ago, Mr. Kuru helped initiate a joint venturebetween Toshiba and Motorola to make chips in Japan. He was adirector of that venture. He worked for three years atToshiba's U.S. subsidiary.   Motorola is the third U.S. technology company to draft aToshiba executive to run its Japanese operations. The othertwo are the Japanese subsidiaries of Apple Computer Inc. andSun Microsystems Inc.   One of Mr. Kuru's tasks will be to smooth over anytensions remaining from Motorola's messy fight two years agowith the Japanese bureaucracy about access to Japan'scellular-telephone market. Helped by the threat of U.S.government sanctions, Motorola won the removal of variousbarriers to its doing business in Tokyo.   Having secured a foothold in Japan's market for thecurrent generation of cellular phones, Motorola under Mr.Kuru will try to obtain a piece of the market for the nextgeneration, digital cellular phones. Motorola is seeking anownership stake in one of two Japanese-led consortia toadminister digital-cellular services. The results of itsefforts are expected to be announced in the next few weeks.</TEXT></DOC>
