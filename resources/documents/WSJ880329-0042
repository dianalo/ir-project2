Perry and David Rogers (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><G> CNG </G><TEXT>   The good times for the Rev. Jesse Jackson may roll on -- and neither his rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination nor other party heavyweights have the temerity to try to break up the celebration.    But most party leaders are petrified about the way the campaign is unfolding and fear the Democrats may give the election to the Republicans.    Mr. Jackson surprised almost everyone by the size of his victory in Saturday's Michigan caucuses. Now he looks forward to the possibility of a triumph April 5 in Wisconsin and perhaps even a surprisingly close showing against Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis today in Connecticut.    Just at the right moment, too, Mr. Jackson is finally breaking into the financial big leagues, with the possibility -- albeit a distant one -- that he might be able to outspend his opponents in the critical final rounds.    &quot;Something is really happening out there now,&quot; says Georgia's Bert Lance, a former budget director under President Carter and a Jackson confidant. &quot;It's obvious he can end up with more delegates than anyone else -- and a lot more popular votes.&quot;    Not many party leaders believe, deep down, that Mr. Jackson can win the nomination, but a few are beginning to think about it. When they do they see nothing but trouble, for the Democrats could be impaled on the horns of a dilemma. If party leaders try to mount a stop-Jackson drive to block his nomination, they will outrage his enthusiastic followers, most of whom are black but a growing number of whom are white and all of whom are loyal Democrats.    And if the miracle really occurs and the party agrees, in the end, to give him the nomination, Democrats stand to outrage Mr. Jackson's critics, almost all of whom are white. These are precisely the conservative Democrats who have tended to stray from the party in recent years.    Party leaders agree the drama must go on, with the rules unchanged. &quot;The man has gone out there and won delegates,&quot; says Samuel Shipley, the Democratic chairman in Delaware. &quot;If he wins more than anyone else, we must give him the nomination, even if it means we lose the election.&quot;    Ed Cole, the party chairman in Mississippi, takes the same line. &quot;If he gets the numbers (the delegates), I hope the party will follow its guidelines and give him the nomination. We lose our credibility otherwise. We've got to go with him under those circumstances.&quot;    The closest thing to a slow-down-Jackson move came from John Baker, the Alabama chairman, who urged other Southern leaders to work at the convention for &quot;the most electable&quot; presidential candidate. He says he is &quot;tired of the Democratic Party having a ticket that can't carry but one or two states.&quot; But he denies his effort is aimed at stopping anyone.    Gov. Dukakis and Sen. Gore are perfectly willing to mix it up with each other, but neither one is willing to take on the formidable Mr. Jackson, who has been the star of almost every debate and who has the most devoted following in the party. Privately, they hope the media will take on the job they are afraid to do themselves. &quot;It's time for the press to scrutinize Jackson as a serious potential nominee,&quot; says Mark Siegel, a member of the Democratic National Committee, &quot;and not patronize him like a token.&quot;    A critical role may be played in all of this by party Chairman Paul Kirk, who has stated publicly that the candidates and select party leaders should sit down at a round table after the last primaries are held and select the nominee. This is based on the widely acknowledged assumption that no one is going to emerge from the primaries and caucuses in June with enough delegates to win a first-ballot nomination. That means the wheeling and dealing will begin as soon as the last primary vote is cast.    When Mr. Kirk first offered this roundtable scenario, Mr. Dukakis was the front-runner. The Jackson people -- and many other party leaders -- insist Mr. Kirk must try to accomplish the same result for Mr. Jackson.    Mr. Kirk says simply that no one will try to block Mr. Jackson because voters &quot;want to let this process run its own full measure, and then we'll just have to wait and see.&quot;    Mr. Lance, the Jackson confidant, dismisses the notion of a successful stop-Jackson drive because &quot;the other candidates are so weak.&quot; One of them, Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri, dropped out of the race yesterday, saying the 167 delegates he had won were now free to make up their own minds. Remaining in the race are Mr. Dukakis and Sens. Albert Gore of Tennessee and Paul Simon of Illinois.    Most party leaders continue to hope, with increasing desperation, that one of them will pick up steam and win more delegates, finally, than Mr. Jackson.    Mr. Dukakis is generally cast in that role, but he has stumbled badly twice in a row -- in Illinois and now in Michigan.    &quot;All I can say,&quot; says Texas chairman Robert Slagle, &quot;is that I hope Dukakis has fired his Michigan co-ordinator or sent him off to some place like American Samoa.&quot;    In Michigan, a caucus state, only Mr. Jackson energized his followers, bringing in substantial numbers of new voters. In districts with heavy black populations, more than twice as many people turned out this time as did four years ago. In largely white districts, where Mr. Dukakis ran well, the increase in turnout was modest.    Now it's on to Wisconsin, where the black population is significantly smaller than in Michigan but where Mr. Jackson has built a base among labor and farm interests.    &quot;Voting for Dukakis is like voting for your boss,&quot; says Daniel Cantor, the Jackson national labor coordinator. &quot;Voting for Jackson is like voting for your shop steward.&quot;    &quot;It is very fluid,&quot; says Suellen Albrecht, the Wisconsin Democratic chairman. &quot;It is possible Jackson could win the state.&quot;    A poll in the Milwaukee Sentinel, taken before Saturday's Michigan caucuses, shows Gov. Dukakis leading Mr. Jackson narrowly, 28% to 25%, with the undecided vote at 25% and the other candidates in single digits. The survey found Mr. Jackson's supporters more firmly behind him than Mr. Dukakis's supporters were behind their candidate.    Sen. Simon is no longer considered to be a major factor in the race, but in Wisconsin he picks away at Mr. Dukakis's liberal support. Sen. Gore has been on television in Wisconsin for more than a week and is preparing a major effort in the April 19 New York primary. He is giving two speeches today in New York City in which he is expected to open a major attack on Gov. Dukakis for being insufficiently supportive of Israel. Sen. Gore hopes to compete with Mr. Dukakis for New York's Jewish vote. But no one picks away at Mr. Jackson's base.    At a forum on urban issues at Fordham University last night, Mr. Jackson's remarks reflected his effort to cast himself as closer to the mainstream of the Democratic Party. Appearing with Sens. Simon and Gore, he joined his fellow candidates in effectively sidestepping a question on whether to provide clean intravenous needles to drug addicts to reduce the risk of infections from AIDS.    &quot;Ban handguns&quot; Mr. Jackson said in a question about crime, but added: &quot;Self-control precedes gun control.&quot;    In describing his own life, he said he was an example of someone who had escaped the &quot;underclass,&quot; but was careful to give credit to government programs such as the hiring advantage given to his veteran father to gain a job at the post office.    As he has in recent weeks, Mr. Jackson aimed his sharpest barbs at the Reagan administration rather than his rivals. &quot;The only public housing he wants to keep fixing up is the one he lives in,&quot; Mr. Jackson said of President Reagan.    Mr. Jackson traditionally runs on the proverbial shoe string, and until now this campaign has been no exception. But times are changing. His campaign reported raising $1.4 million in donations during January and February, not far behind the well-heeled Gov. Dukakis ($2 million) and ahead of the now-retired Rep. Gephardt ($1.3 million) and Sen. Gore ($1.2 million).    Much of Mr. Jackson's money is being plowed back into a direct-mail program, which reportedly is growing rapidly. Receipts from direct mail were $400,000 in February alone. His direct-mail specialist is Mal Warwick of Berkeley, Calif., a veteran who worked earlier for Gary Hart. &quot;Jesse Jackson,&quot; says Mr. Warwick, &quot;has magic in the mails.&quot;    ---   Brooks Jackson also contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
