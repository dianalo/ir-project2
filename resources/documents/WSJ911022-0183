The case highlights a problem long recognized by divorcelawyers, the illegal gathering of information againsthusbands and wives by their estranged spouses. It alsohighlights a question over which courts remain deeply split:does the Federal Wiretap Act of 1968 bar family members fromtape recording each other's conversations?</LP><TEXT>   The legislative intent of the federal law, as applied tofamilies, has always been unclear. Last January it became anissue in a sensational murder trial in California. That caseinvolved a woman accused of murder who allegedly plotted herhusband's death over the phone, only to find herselfincriminated because her husband had installed a voiceactivated tape recorder.   A California state appeals court ruled that the tapescould be used against her at a trial: &quot;Interspousaleavesdropping and phone tapping in the family home, overfamily phones,&quot; the court ruled, are not prohibited by thefederal wiretap act. That case has since been appealed to theCalifornia Supreme Court.   The Cleveland case raised the same issue, though not asdramatically. Cleveland attorney William T. Wuliger acceptedseveral tape recordings from his client of conversations onhis home phone. The conversations included some between theclient's wife and her boyfriend. Mr. Wuliger had nothing todo with the taping but reasoned that his client's wife gaveimplicit consent to being recorded because in oneconversation she openly voiced her suspicion that the linewas tapped.   Mr. Wuliger subsequently used transcripts from theconversations in two hearings and two depositions. Federalprosecutors decided to pursue him because the JusticeDepartment's &quot;priority is to go after the professionalsinvolved,&quot; said a prosecutor involved in the case. Mr.Wuliger's client received immunity and was not prosecutedbecause his testimony was needed to convict Mr. Wuliger.   A prosecutor said that nearly 80% of illegal electronicsurveillance, including wiretapping, occurs in divorce cases.Bringing criminal charges in this instance was seen as anopportunity to deter continued abuses, the prosecutor said.   Lawyers who specialize in family law said yesterday thatclients in contested or bitter divorce cases frequentlywiretap their home phones to gather incriminating evidence.To the fighting parties, said Gary Skoloff, past chairman ofthe American Bar Association's family law section,wiretapping is not much different than opening a spouse'smail.   &quot;Unfortunately, wiretapping is more widespread than mostpeople realize,&quot; said Mr. Skoloff, adding that most divorcelawyers shun it because of criminal implications.   John Garner, Mr. Wuliger's attorney in Cleveland, said heplans to appeal the verdict.   ---   BOY SCOUTS win judgment in suit over firearmsadvertisement.   The suit was filed last year by the mother of a12-year-old boy who died in a shooting accident in 1988. Themother contended that her son was &quot;influenced and motivated&quot;to experiment with a rifle after reading a 16-page firearmsadvertising section in Boys Life magazine, published by BoyScouts of America Inc., Irving, Texas.   The Boy Scouts, represented by Thomas Leatherbury of theDallas law firm Locke Purnell Rain Harrell, argued that themother shouldn't collect damages from the scoutingorganization because it had no duty to its readers,regardless of their age, to refrain from publishing theadvertisement, as the plaintiff alleged. The organizationalso claimed that a Texas criminal law prohibiting firearmsales to minors wasn't intended to curtail advertising.   State District Judge Bill Rhea of Dallas agreed earlierthis month, ruling that the plaintiffs could not collectdamages from the Boy Scouts. Two other defendants, who weresponsors of the advertising section, remain in the suit:Remington Arms Co., a unit of Du Pont Co., Wilmington, Del.,and the National Shooting Sports Foundation of Wilton, Conn.   Plaintiff's lawyer Windle Turley of Dallas said he and hisclient &quot;will definitely appeal the matter . . . as far as wehave to go.&quot; The appeals could go to the U.S. Supreme Court,he said, because of the First Amendment defenses raised bythe Boy Scouts.   ---   ASBESTOS DEFENDANTS ask appeals court to remove judge fromclass action.   The request that the Third Circuit Court of Appeals inPhiladelphia order federal district court Judge James M.Kelly to step down from the eight-year-old school asbestoslitigation was made by attorneys for Pfizer Inc., one of 36former asbestos manufacturers named as defendants.   The unusual petition was filed three months after JudgeKelly refused to remove himself from the case, in which35,000 public and private schools in the U.S. are seekingreimbursement for the costs of testing and removing asbestosfrom school buildings. The defendants are seeking the judge'sremoval because he attended a conference at which some of theexpert witnesses for the plaintiffs gave presentations.   &quot;This issue has already been argued at the trial courtlevel. There is no reasonable grounds for the court to recuseitself,&quot; said Herbert B. Newberg, a Philadelphia lawyer whois co-lead counsel for the plaintiffs.   ---   NOTED: Powell McHenry, former vice president and generalcounsel of Procter andamp; Gamble Co., has joined the Cincinnatilaw firm Dinsmore andamp; Shohl on an of counsel basis.
