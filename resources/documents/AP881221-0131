Opposition accusations that he won the presidency by fraud couldmake his task to reunify a nation split by deep political and ethnicrivalries even more difficult.   If the opposition gets its way, the election will be nullified.   Former Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike, who won 44.9 percentof the vote, compared with 50.4 percent for Premadasa, claimed shewas denied the presidency by government fraud.   ``I would have been the winner if it would have been done fair,''she said, adding that her party would challenge the results in theSupreme Court.   But Premadasa's main task will be to end the ethnic bloodshedthat has killed nearly 10,000 people on this tropical Indian Oceanisland since 1983, when Tamil minority extremists began aninsurgency to win independence from the majority Sinhalese.   Sinhalese extremists belonging to the People's Liberation Fronthave since launched their own violent campaign to undermine thegovernment.   They abhor the 1987 accord with New Delhi that provides limitedautonomy to Tamils and places 47,000 Indian peacekeeping troops onSri Lankan soil.   Premadasa, the candidate of the ruling United National Party, wonMonday's election with 50.4 percent of the vote. He immediatelyappealed to the front to join the democratic process by contestingFebruary parliamentary elections, the first in 11 years.   He had laid the groundwork for such an appeal during thecampaign, when he took pains not to blame the front for violencewidely attributed to the group.   If the extremists decline, the new president could decide arelentless crackdown is the only solution, hoping the bulk of SriLanka's 16 million people would support such a move as the bestalternative to restore law and order.   A rebuff of the overture by the extremists, said one Westerndiplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity, would make people``more likely to back him if he decides to go out and do somebashing.''   The front, which nearly toppled the government in November with aboycott that has since lost steam, has given no indication of itsnext move.   It remains to be seen whether the front's power was diminished bythe presidential elections, which the group had vowed to undermine.   The insurgency of Tamil separatists in the northeast, meanwhile,has yet to be quelled despite the positioning of Indian troops toenforce the 1987 accord that grants some autonomy to the minoritygroup that comprises 18 percent of the population.   Premadasa says he wants the Indian soldiers out of his country,but reality might require they stay.   India, which has become more active as regional superpower underPrime MInister Rajiv Gandhi, remains dedicated to keeping its troopsin place until the separatist insurgency is quashed.   And if the Indian troops were to withdraw from the north whileSinhalese extremists remained active in the south, the Sri Lankanarmed forces would be drawn impossibly thin to deal with bothuprisings.   One possible solution would be a token withdrawal of some Indiantroops that Premadasa could use as proof of progress on his pledge.   Quelling the insurgencies could help Premadasa tackle the otherhuge problem he faces _ a national economy in shambles.   The fighting not only has devastated the island's crucial tourismindustry but has cut into agricultural production as well.   In 1987, for example, adverse weather and civil disturbances werelargely responsible for an 11 percent decline in rubber productionand 25 percent drop in coconut production, the two top crops aftertea.   Premadasa comes from a humble background and has vowed to betterliving standards in this impoverished country, where the annual percapita income is $360.   He has proposed a welfare program under which many Sri Lankanfamilies would qualify for $75 monthly in benefits for two years.   Where the government would come up with the money, however, hehas not outlined.   Still, the president-elect's populist pitch, upcomingparliamentary elections that many political parties have longdemanded and the widespread desire for law and order all could workin Premadasa's favor as he grapples with the daunting task ofresurrecting Sri Lanka.</TEXT><TEXT>   _   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Dan Biers is the Associated Press news editor inHong Kong.</TEXT></DOC>
