Respondents to the national survey overwhelmingly blamed therecent surge in gasoline prices on oil company greed, not theMiddle East tensions. But many foresaw true shortages and stillhigher prices in the next few months.   Despite those fears, and despite widespread expectations of aU.S.-Iraq war, the poll found strong support for the use of U.S.troops to defend Saudi Arabia against possible Iraqi attack.Sixty-four percent voiced approval.   The survey of 1,004 adults was conducted Wednesday throughSunday, after President Bush's announcement he was sending troopsand Iraq's announcement it was annexing Kuwait, which it invadedAug. 2.   Several polls since Bush's speech have found Americans rallyingto his side. Support for the use of U.S. troops has ranged from 63percent in a poll conducted Tuesday and Wednesday to 81 percent ina one-day poll Wednesday night.   Support for Bush personally is roughly as high. Seventy-sevenpercent in a poll Friday to Sunday by ICR Survey Research Groupgenerally approved of the way he has been handling the situation.And two-thirds said his reaction has been ``about right,'' ratherthan too tough or too weak.   Concerns underlie the support, however. In the AP poll, alsoconducted by ICR, 33 percent said the United States is ``verylikely'' to become involved in a war with Iraq. An additional 39percent called war ``somewhat likely.''   Approval of the U.S. troop commitment varied among some groupsin the population. Republicans were more supportive than wereDemocrats and independents _ 74 percent, compared with 61 and 63percent, respectively.   College-educated Americans also were more supportive of the useof U.S. troops. And most strikingly, women were far less supportivethan men of the troop commitment, 51 percent to 79 percent.   Beyond his aid to Saudi Arabia, Bush has said Iraq's invasion ofKuwait ``will not stand.'' But poll respondents were less clear onthat outcome: Just one-third expected an international economicembargo of Iraq to succeed in forcing it out of Kuwait.   And many did not favor a military alternative. Thirty-fivepercent backed the use of U.S. troops to try to push Iraq out ofKuwait, and even fewer _ 27 percent _ favored bombing Iraqimilitary targets to force it from Kuwait.   On oil, 86 percent said oil companies were taking advantage ofthe situation when they raised gasoline after Iraq attacked Kuwait;just 6 percent called the increases legitimate, with the restunsure.   But 52 percent said they believe the situation in the MiddleEast is likely to create real oil shortages in the next few months,with rising prices and long lines at the service stations.   The AP poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3percentage points. ICR, of Media, Pa., is part of AUS ConsultantCos.</TEXT></DOC>
