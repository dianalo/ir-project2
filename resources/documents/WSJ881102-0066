Pay-per-view is an idea whose time has been long in coming, and the nascent market is still beset by problems that could make it hard for the industry ever to meet its promise. While the technology has been around for a decade, fewer than 25% of the nation's 45 million cable subscribers have the so-called addressable equipment that enables them to order pay-per-view programs by phone. And only a fraction of those have the more advanced, two-way &quot;impulse&quot; technology that lets them order at the touch of a button.    However, industry executives' hopes have been raised by some recent developments, the most encouraging of which is an American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. system that helps customers order more easily. Pay-per-view's most avid proponents say annual revenues from movies and events, estimated to be less than $100 million this year, could reach $6 billion within the next decade, exceeding those of such pay cable networks as Time Inc.'s Home Box Office.    &quot;All the elements are finally in place for this business to take off in 1989,&quot; maintains Jeffrey Reiss, who launched Request in 1985 and started its second channel of pay-per-view programming in July.    According to a recent study by Warner Communications Inc., there's plenty of room for improvement. The study found that, while cable operators could take in $10 a month from each pay-per-view subscriber, &quot;most systems barely sell to 20% of their total subscribers, each month generating less than 80 cents per subscriber.&quot;    Edward Bleier, who oversees the pay-television operations of the company's Warner Bros. Inc. subsidiary, says the more than 250 local cable systems offering pay-per-view frequently don't have &quot;consumer-friendly&quot; hardware, typically don't offer enough channels and fail to schedule hit movies and events often enough or at convenient times. Moreover, he says, cable operators don't spend enough on such things as advertising, special promotional channels and program guides for pay-per-view.    &quot;Cable operators really have to bring the concept of a local multiplex theater into the subscriber's home,&quot; says Mr. Bleier, who has been trying to persuade cable operators to schedule hit movies at successive hours on three or four channels. Although some operators are upgrading older cable systems and offering pay-per-view on additional channels, many say they don't have enough free channels to devote more than one to pay-per-view.    &quot;Pay-per-view is still almost a nonbusiness, and it's a strategic quagmire,&quot; concedes Scott Kurnit, who heads Viewer's Choice, Viacom Inc.'s pay-per-view subsidiary. Mr. Kurnit notes that studios and cable operators continue to squabble over how to run the business and divide pay-per-view revenues, and that videocassette retailers are pressuring studios not to release movies on pay-per-view at or near the time they come out on tape.    Nevertheless, Mr. Kurnit and other executives contend that at least some of the industry's problems are being addressed.    On the programming front, event promoters such as the World Boxing Federation and the World Wrestling Federation are stepping up the number of pay-per-view programs they sponsor, encouraged by the success of the Michael Spinks-Mike Tyson championship boxing match in July. That fight brought in more than $21 million from some 600,000 pay-per-view homes. Now promoters of everything from rock concerts to Broadway plays are jumping on the bandwagon.    Even more important, though, is that ATandamp;T and the regional telephone companies have recently entered the market with national ordering systems. Most people in the industry agree that pay-per-view can be successful only if customers have the ability to buy on the spur of the moment. &quot;You have to make it as easy and convenient as possible for the customer who never leaves that seat in front of the TV,&quot; says David MacDonald, president of New York Times Co.'s cable operations, which the company recently put on the auction block.    Currently, most of the cable operators that offer pay-per-view do so through addressable converters, which enable the operator to send signals and messages into the home but don't allow the subscriber to communicate back. To watch a program, subscribers must call their local cable company, where phone attendants arrange for an unscrambled version of the show to be transmitted. The whole process is costly and labor intensive, and phone attendants are often swamped with last-minute orders they can't fill in time.    Impulse technology solves this problem by enabling customers to order movies simply by pushing a button on a remote-control unit in their home. &quot;You always get the best buy rates on a pure impulse system,&quot; says Larry Gerbrandt, an analyst with Paul Kagan Associates, a media research firm in Carmel, Calif.    Hal Krisbergh, president of General Instrument Inc.'s Jerrold division, says the 200,000 subscribers to Jerrold's Cable Video Store, an impulse pay-per-view service, order five times more films than the average addressable pay-per-view customer. The ability to make an instantaneous choice is crucial, the Hatboro, Pa., company says, since half of Cable Video Store's customers decide to buy a movie after it starts.    At present, however, only one million cable homes have access to impulse technology, through either two-way cables or a combination of cables and phone lines connected to a remote-control device. What's more, providing cable customers with impulse technology can cost more than twice as much as conventional cable-TV equipment.    ATandamp;T's approach strikes a compromise. Its toll-free, 800-number service can fill orders in as little as 10 seconds. When an order is received, ATandamp;T relays the caller's phone number to a customer data base for verification; if it checks out, the local cable operator's computer is instructed to unscramble the program and send it to the caller's TV set.    The cable operator need invest only about $10,000 for a special computer and cover the costs of the 19-cent toll call for each order. Pat Andersen, director of the ATandamp;T program, says the company is adding about 100,000 cable subscribers monthly to the program and expects to have more than 1.5 million Viewers Choice and Request Television subscribers on line by the end of the year.    Kagan's Mr. Gerbrandt says ATandamp;T's system could bridge the gap between the cumbersome phone-order systems and impulse technology. &quot;It's still not what the industry needs to reach full potential,&quot; he adds, &quot;but it is a quantum step.&quot;    ---               The Status of Pay-Per-View TV    Number of households receiving various types of TV services                      (In millions)                               1986   1987   1988*   1989* Total households              87.4   88.6   89.7    90.7 Total cable subscribers       39.7   43.8   46.8    49.2 Addressable subscribers       11.6   15.1   17.9    20.9 Impulse subscribers            0.4    0.7    1.0     1.9    *Projected    Note: addressable systems let pay-per-view operators send signals and messages to specific subscribers; impulse technology allows for two-way communication.
