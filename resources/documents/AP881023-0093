This became the lineup in April when Democrat Rose P. Moffordautomatically became Arizona's governor with the state Senate'sconviction of Evan Mecham, a Republican who had been electedgovernor in 1986, of ``high crimes, misdemeanors and malfeasance inoffice.''   Mrs. Mofford, next in line as secretary of state, had becomeacting governor Feb. 5 when Mecham was impeached by the ArizonaHouse. She became governor when the state Senate convicted Mechamon April 4, and she took the oath of office the next day.   The last time Republicans were in a majority among the governorswas with the election of 1969, a GOP record of 32 governors.   Democrats have dominated the executive mansions since 1970,reaching 37 in 1976 and 1977.   Since 1960, here were the total political lineups for governor,generally reflecting the immediate result of that year'sgubernatorial elections, with most newly elected governors takingoffice the next year.   The 1968 figures reflect a Democrat eventually becoming governorin Maryland replacing a Republican who was that year's VicePresident-elect Spiro Agnew.   The independent governor listed here was Maine's James B.Longley.</TEXT><TEXT>   </TEXT><HEAD>Election  DEMOCRATS  REPUBLICANS  INDEPENDENT </HEAD><TEXT>   </TEXT><HEAD>  Year      Total     Total         Total     </HEAD><TEXT/><TEXT>     1960        34        16            0</TEXT><TEXT>     1961        34        16            0</TEXT><TEXT>     1962        33        17            0</TEXT><TEXT>     1963        34        16            0</TEXT><TEXT>     1964        33        17            0</TEXT><TEXT>     1965        33        17            0</TEXT><TEXT>     1966        24        26            0</TEXT><TEXT>     1967        24        26            0</TEXT><TEXT>     1968        20        30            0</TEXT><TEXT>     1969        18        32            0</TEXT><TEXT>     1970        29        21            0</TEXT><TEXT>     1971        30        20            0</TEXT><TEXT>     1972        31        19            0</TEXT><TEXT>     1973        32        18            0</TEXT><TEXT>     1974        36        13            1</TEXT><TEXT>     1975        36        13            1</TEXT><TEXT>     1976        37        12            1</TEXT><TEXT>     1977        37        12            1</TEXT><TEXT>     1978        32        18            0</TEXT><TEXT>     1979        31        19            0</TEXT><TEXT>     1980        27        23            0</TEXT><TEXT>     1981        27        23            0</TEXT><TEXT>     1982        34        16            0</TEXT><TEXT>     1983        35        15            0</TEXT><TEXT>     1984        34        16            0</TEXT><TEXT>     1985        34        16            0</TEXT><TEXT>     1986        26        24            0</TEXT><TEXT>     1987        26        24            0</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
