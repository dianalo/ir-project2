For instance, when the driving power source voltage for the emergencycore cooling system is detected and, if it is lower than a predeterminedvalue, the reactor protection system is operated. Alternatively, if thevoltage goes lower than the predetermined value, the control rod withdrawalis inhibited. In addition, stopping for the feedwater system is inhibited.Further, integrity of the driving means for the emergency core coolingsystem is positively checked and the protection function is operateddepending on the result of check. Since the nuclear reactor can be settoward the safety side even if the voltage for the driving power sourceof the aqueous boric acid injection system is lower than a predeterminedvalue, the reactor safety can further be improved.
