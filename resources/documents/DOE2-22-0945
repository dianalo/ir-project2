A total of 108 samples of building materialsand maintenance parts were taken for analysis. The polarized-light microscopewas used on site to identify the majority of the asbestos-containingmaterials and pinpoint their locations. Asbestos was found in 46 samples;82% of these samples were related to insulation materials for wrappingpipes and boiler/hot-water tanks. The other positive tests were for gasketmaterials or transite board. In general, the insulation was in good repairwith only minor areas needing wrapping or plastering. Unless the asbestosbecame damaged, its removal could be delayed and associated with buildingrepair or renovations. The author concludes that asbestos exposure tothe general work force and residents is minimal. Those pipes with insulationthat were not in good shape were identified so that recommended actioncould be taken to remove the hazards.</TEXT></DOC>
