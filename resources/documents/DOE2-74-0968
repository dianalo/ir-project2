<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-74-0968 </DOCNO><TEXT>A small-sized optical cryostat with a superconducting magnetic system,permitting to carry out magnetic and magneto-optical investigations ina homogeneous magnetic field up to 55 kOe is described. A specimen iscooled by a gaseous helium flow of a certain temperature. The cryostatpreparation time before measurements is 40-45 min. The described cryostathas demonstrated high reliability in operation at 4.2-300 K during twoyears.</TEXT></DOC>
