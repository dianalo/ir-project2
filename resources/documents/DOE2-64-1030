The complex local strain and temperature histories at criticallocations must be accurately interpreted to account for the effects ofvarious damage mechanisms (such as fatigue, creep, and oxidation) andtheir possible interactions. As part of the overall NASA HOST effort,this program is designed to investigate these fundamental damage processes,identify modeling strategies, and develop practical models which canbe used to guide the early design and development of new engines andto increase the durability of existing engines.</TEXT></DOC>
