The flow is the summation of pressurized flow and electrophoreticflow. The terms of mass transfer in the mobile phase and the couplingterm of eddy diffusion are reduced compared to those in conventionalchromatography. To attain a constant retention time, about 20 min mustelapse after electrovoltage is applied along a column. This time lagmight be equal to the period needed to alter the nature of the columnsupports due to the application of electrovoltage. In electrochromatography,it is possible to retain a charged solute in a column if its mobilityis toward the column head and equal or larger than the pressurized flowvelocity. Typical separations are demonstrated.</TEXT></DOC>
