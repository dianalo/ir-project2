Co.andP;  Reaps CIM's Bottom-Line Benefits on the Shop FloorandM;As middle-brow middle managers rise to the helm of America's corporations,the bottom line becomes, well, the bottom line.andP;  The cry of these corporalsof business is, if you can't cost-justify it, forget it.andP;  But formanufacturing companies the actual gains gained from investment ininformation technology are frequently found further down the corporateladder--smack in the middle of the shop floor.andM;That's where Deere andamp; Co., the $5.37 billion maker of mobile power equipment,reaped the real rewards of a computer-integrated manufacturing effort that itbegan back in 1984.andP;  &quot;A draftsman is twice fast now,&quot; declares Darryl Cain,Deere's supervisor of production engineering systems.andP;  Cain oversees the CIMsystem used in numerical control (NC) programming, plant engineering, processplanning and distributed NC at Deere's East Moline, Ill., plant.andM;Deere, which has been plowing big bucks into CIM since 1980, sees thetechnology triggering efficiency.andP;  Those boosts in efficiency were especiallycritical nine years ago.andP;  &quot;Struck by the industry downturn in the early '80s,we had a definite need to improve our efficiencies across the board,&quot;explains Cain.andM;&quot;We actually redefined our direction and selected a pilot project that wouldmake CIM a reality,&quot; Cain says.andP;  That pilot, launched in 1984, called forautomating the design and manufacture of the sheet metal parts for a combineproduced at the plant.andP;  The new Maximizer combine was the first productactually produced under this CIM program.andM;&quot;Rather than a collection of various automation projects,&quot; says Cain, &quot;thisproject would put it all together, integrating our automation.andP;  Sheet metalwas the particular segment of our business that we felt we could reallyleverage with technology.&quot;andP;  A good decision, since sheet metal accounts forroughly 60% of the small parts of a combine.andM;Sheet metal, which starts out as a big coil of steel, is cut into large, flatsheets at the factory.andP;  Holes are punched into it, and then it is bent orformed into its final shape.andP;  After that, it gets sent to the spotweldingoperation or to get painted before it's finally assembled into the finishedcombine.andP;  In pre-CIM days, all design work was done in another facility, onpaper.andP;  Blueprints would be created and hand delivered to the factory, threemiles away.andM;An NC programmer would then lay out the flat pattern for the part and punchthe tape to program the controller.andP;  The tape punching alone would take halfan hour.andM;The CIM project that trimmed those times was actually a team effort amongpersonnel from Deere's systems engineering, plant manufacturing and corporateinformation systems operations.andP;  The result was a streamlined and intergratedsheet metal fabrication design process.andP;  Using this CIM process, Cainexplains, gave Deere &quot;the ability to design [sheet metal parts] on computergraphics and the ability to add the flat pattern and pass that file throughNC programming.andP;  Once the program was generated through the machine tool,then it could be sent to the shop floor.&quot;andM;To make the part drawings on line, graphics information for the particularpart is entered into a CDS 4201 computer graphics system from ComputervisionCorp. of Bedford, Mass., via an Instaview terminal from the same vendor.andM;Once the drawing is complete, it's sent to the corporate IBM 3090 mainframeover a MAP (manufacturing automation protocol)-compatible network fromMarlborough, Mass.-based Concord Data Systems via Deere's own file managementsystem.andM;Next, the part data are downloaded to a Computervision CGP 200X CPU in thefactory, where they are NC programmed.andP;  The output is an ASCII text file thatis transferred to the factory's DEC VAX.andP;  distributed numerical controloperates off the VAX, with software written by Numeritronics of Cupertino,Calif.andP;  The CIM scheme has since been expanded factorywide, and severalthousand parts are now designed, drafted, NC programmed and produced on thesystem.andM;&quot;It's probably 80% the way we would have wanted it to turn out,&quot; Caindeclares.andP;  &quot;It hasn't been a piece of cake.andP;  We had to switch direction anumber of times.andP;  We had to struggle at times to make things work.andP;  Noteverything is the way it should be yet.&quot;andP;  He advises peers planning a similarendeavor to &quot;allow yourself more flexibility--plan for more contingencies.&quot;andM;The efficiency edge comes from being able to make revisions more quickly.andO;&quot;Designers don't have to re-create the geometry all the time,&quot; he explains,adding, &quot;The longer you work on one of these systems, the bigger the base ofexisting drawings becomes, and you get greater efficiency.&quot;andM;NC Programming is also a much easier and efficient task.andP;  The design for asheet metal part describes the piece already bent.andP;  What's difficult istaking that design a step back to figure out what it looks like flat.andP;  CIMsimplifies that step, says Cain, by incorporating it into the actual designprocess that is based along to NC programming.andM;&quot;But what are we really saving?andP;  That's the argument we get into,&quot; says Cain.andO;&quot;There's always subjectivity surrounding justification and the actual resultsof CIM.andP;  The investment is obviously millions of dollars, well in excess of$10 million overall.andP;  Of course, the savings, we would claim, are well inexcess of the investment.&quot;andM;So, for Deere, the bottom line is on the shop floor.andP;  &quot;We're doing thingsbetter, we're doing it with less resources and we're doing it moreefficiently,&quot; sums up Cain.andP;  &quot;The bottom line is, if you said we were goingback to the old way of doing things, you'd be looked at like a crazy man.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
