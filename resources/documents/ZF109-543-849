 The decision is very bad news for Encore Computer Corp, justgetting onto its feet after a very difficult genesis, because Matra wasmanufacturing the Encore Multimax parallel Unix machines under licence.andP;  Themove also kicks Norsk Data AS when it is very much down because although ithad been so disappointed with Matra's achievements in marketing its machinesin Southern Europe that it scaled back the agreement to a non-exclusive onefor France only last year, it still represented significant business for theNorwegian - although work that Matra had been doing incorporating Nord minisinto military workstations for Thomson CSF is likely to continue.andP;  Also hurtis Sun Microsystems, which had large OEM contracts with Matra - said lastyear to be one of the French company's areas of weak performance.andP;  The shutdown is also a disappointment for a string of software companies, includingMicro Focus Plc and Relational Technology Inc, which had hoped to dosubstantial business from sales of Matra's Unix systems.andP;  Also affected areseveral European research ventures in which Matra was a partner.andP;  The futureof Matra's innovative artificial intelligence Unix server, built around itsproprietary 1MLIPS Drake inference processor (CI No 877) is now in doubt.andO;Storm cones were first hoisted over the company back in June, when PresidentCharles Picasso resigned amid gossip that times were hard at the company (CINo 952).andP;  Matra had recorded a profit of $800,000 on sales of $85m in 1987,and at mid-year was still hoping to make a bigger profit on flat sales.andP;  Butin the event, sales for 1988 plunged 36% to $53m.andP;  Employment at the company- 400 in 1987 - was greatly reduced last year by the sale of the factorymaking special function terminals in Colmer, Alsace, to ETC SA, and was downto 140 at closure.andP;  Matra reckons its installed base at 1,500 workstationsand 80 systems, and has retained Thomson CSF's new Thomainfor third partymaintenance operation to look after its customers; Agence France Presse reports that the 35 support staff at Matra will be offered jobs by Thomainfor,and the other 105 employees will be offered jobs in other parts of the Matragroup.andM;ATandamp;T, INTEL JOIN FORCES ON LOCAL NET, ISDN CIRCUITSandM;ATandamp;T Microelectronics Inc and Intel Corp duly made their joint announcementin Burlingame, California late last week, and, as we hazarded in CI No 1,103,it was indeed on second-sourcing of each other's ISDN circuits.andP;  Local areanetwork chips are also included under the five-year agreement under which thetwo companies will each sell the others local net and ISDN chips and worktogether to define, develop and manufacture future generations of localnetwork and ISDN devices.andM;INTEL OFFERS THIRD PARTY MAINTENANCE SERVICEandM;Intel Corp has also plunged into the third party maintenance business,offering support to users of all machines built around the iAPX86microprocessor family, and extending support to modems, monitors and printersand add-in boards.andP;  In Europe, the service will use the European RepairCentre in Swindon.andP;  It offers large users a come-on in the form of a &quot;nocall, no charge&quot; option and remote diagnostic lines.andM;CONVERGENT ADDS MID-RANGE MACHINE TO ITS UNIX LINEandM;Convergent Inc, now part of Unisys Corp, has extended its Unix systemsofferings with a new 25MHz 68020based S/480 machine below the S/640 andextended memory on the latter to 64Mb, to support 64 users.andP;  The S/480 has4Mb to 16Mb memory, 128Kb cache, up to 650Mb on disk, and optional 68881maths chip and external SCSI interface.andP;  A 20-user 8Mb configuration with145Mb disk costs $30,200.andP;  A 16Mb S/640 fitted with 325Mb of Winchester costs$56,500.andM;IBM BACKS SOFTWARE JOBS EFFORT IN NORTHERN IRELANDandM;IBM is supplying hardware and software for a #5m project at Queen'sUniversity, Belfast to create jobs in Ulster's software industry.andP;  Thehardware and software from IBM will be made available to software houses inthe province, and the Industrial Development Board hopes to use availabilityof the computer power to encourage creation of new firms.andM;NEW MOVE TO TAKE OVER NBI IS IN THE WINDandM;Although Steve Jerritts, now at the helm at Boulder, Colorado-based officeand Unix systems builder NBI Inc declares roundly that he is not turning thecompany round just to sell it, the matter could be taken out of his hands.andO;Two senior officers of Colorado leasing company Capital Associates have cometogether with Jirka Ryssavy, the businessman who bought some of NBI's stores,to buy a 6.1% stake in NBI.andP;  Their mandatory filing with the Securities andamp;Exchange Commission notifying the holding says that they may seek control ofthe company, to engineer the sale of the company, or follow other potentiallyhostile strategies.andP;  Capital Associates suggested a $7 a share tender offerfor NBI last year in the wake of a stakebuilding exercise by investment fundmanager Kenneth Fisher, who wanted to take control of the board at thebeginning of last year.andP;  Both were seen off by NBI but Fisher's funds stillhold 5%, and he has been approached by the Capital people.andM;GEC PLESSEY COUP IN INDIAandM;Plessey Co Plc's assiduous efforts over the years to come up with a pay phonethat could withstand the worst that British hooligans could throw at them arereally beginning to pay off for successor company GEC PlesseyTelecommunications Ltd. Having got a foothold in the vast Soviet market, thecompany has made possibly an even bigger coup to the south, where it willtake 40% of a joint venture with Usha Pte Ltd to manufacture payphones inIndia.andP;  The prize is a government commitment to install at least one coinoperated telephone in each of the country's 575,000 villages.andP;  GEC Plesseywill provide the technology and phones will initially be assembled fromimported components until local industry can fill the gap.andP;  GEC Plessey looksto make 5,000 to 7,000 phones at the plant this year, 15,000 to 20,000 nextyear.andM;IBM FIRES A BROADSIDE IN THE TRANSACTIONandM;PROCESSING BENCHMARK WARSandM;When it comes to benchmarking, IBM wants it both ways.andP;  Although happy tospend time singing the praises of its proprietary RAMP-C benchmark, itrefuses to publish detailed testing specifications, automaticallyinvalidating any competitors' attempts to use it.andP;  This impasse was amplyillustrated during a recent South Bank seminar given by John Laskowski, themanager of IBM's Performance Evaluation Centre in Dallas.andP;  Revealing justenough to suggest RAMP-C - Registered Approach for Measurement Performance -Cobol - superiority, he promptly slammed Unisys Corp for offering &quot;RAMP-C&quot;performance figures at the launch of its new Micro A. Having scrabbledthrough the manuals, the best that manufacturers can currently hope for isgrudging IBM recognition of some &quot;RAMPC-alike&quot; testing procedures.andP;  Accordingto Laskowski, the merits of RAMP-C lie in its ability to test systemperformance in a commercial processing environment.andP;  Commercial workloads,argued Laskowski, are typified by few floating point calculations, moderatequantities of application and supervisor execution time, but comparativelylarge amounts of input-output activity.andP;  RAMP-C Cobol programs, he continued,are designed to measure these conditions in two ways - the represention ofinteractive applications through simulating users, and the testing of a &quot;fullrange&quot; of system resources, comprising disk, terminal, main storage andprocessor.andM;Very simpleandM;Further credit is claimed for dividing RAMP-C transactions into multiplelevels of complexity, and using operator think time, simulated keying rates,and input character count parameters to define a range of functions andcomplexities.andP;  Running terminals in multiples of five, a &quot;simple&quot; transactionconstitutes a keyplus-think rate of 7.5 seconds, and uses 20% - one terminal- of available terminal power.andP;  This changes to 10.0 seconds and 20% for an&quot;average&quot; transaction, 18.2 seconds and 40% for &quot;complex&quot; transactions, and26.0 seconds and 20% within the &quot;very complex&quot; category.andP;  When compared withDebit/Credit, Laskowski claims a number of advantages.andP;  Chief of these isthat Debit/Credit is a bankingbased benchmark, gathering results via asingle, &quot;simple&quot;, file update-intensive application.andP;  Second is the number ofdifferent implementations which abound.andP;  The ET1 implementation, for exampleusually implies an external driver, while TP1 implies an internal driver andrelational database.andP;  This, in turn, leads to muddled definitions ofperformance, particularly in relation to response time.andP;  Laskowski alsoclaims that the stipulated scaling rules - 100,000 account records to 100teller records to 10 branch records - are expensive to implement andconsequently, may not be fully adhered to.andP;  Finally, Laskowski challenged theuse of response time as an accurate method of determining system throughput,by arguing that results can vary greatly depending upon system configuration.andO;By applying memory, disk and liberal amounts of fine-tuning, sub- secondinternal response times can be gained without any real reflection of what thesystem is capable of, he said.andP;  By contrast, the &quot;conservative&quot; RAMP-Censures that any bottle-neck is the processor.andP;  Initially, the processor isrun until it is saturated with transactions; system capacity, measured intransactions per hour is then established as 70% of the speed attained atsaturation point.andP;  The trade-off, said Laskowski is minimal; users gain anaccurate impression of system capability, and an &quot;average&quot; response time,which tends to fall between the 1.0 and 2.5 second range.andP;  A further chanceto discredit the Debit/Credit benchmark came with an exhaustive account ofIBM's responses to DEC's current bout of benchmarking propaganda.andP;  At thelaunch of its DECintact transaction processing monitor (CI No 975), DECentered the benchmarking fray by claiming transaction per second ratesranging from 6tps on the MicroVAX 3600, through to 53tps on two combined VAX8810s.andP;  The company took equal pleasure in flaunting an externally auditedset of tests, showing CICS/VSE-VSAM software running on an IBM 9377-90 and a4381-22 notching up just 5.0tps and 7.3tps respectively.andP;  IBM, saidLaskowski, was &quot;not very comfortable with these results&quot;, and subsequentlyappointed its own consultant to re-run the tests.andP;  The results attainedplaced the 9377-90 at 17.1tps, and the 4381- 22 at 22.1tps.andP;  Confronted bythis unwelcome set of new figures, DEC turned for salvation to simulationmethodology, arguing that IBM's results had been achieved by using 10terminals for each tps measurement, whereas it had used 100.andM;IBM then re-ran the tests to DEC methodology specifications, and found that17.1tps dropped only to 15.8, and 22.1tps fell back only to 20.8.andP;  Thediffering results, argued Laskowski, are a reflection of the inherentweaknesses of Debit/Credit benchmarking procedures.andM;DEC responseandM;The current DEC response, for those still interested, is that it has yet tosee full details of how IBM achieved its final results.andP;  In addition, DEC'sUK marketing manager Mike Hudgell believes that &quot;although not perfect&quot;, theDebit/Credit benchmark tests many important system functions, includingscreen handling, database, TP monitor and processor.andP;  For DEC customers, whocan use VAXclusters and SMP multiprocessing to grow system capacity easily,response time is more of an issue, he added.andP;  IBM meanwhile, is lookingforward to reading DEC's account of how it arrived at its initialmeasurements - a report promised last year, but yet to be published.andP;  Forthose who see the benchmarking cold war developing into a bloody, protracted,and increasingly childish campaign, a glimmer of hope has emerged on thehorizon.andP;  This takes the form of the Transaction Processing PerformanceCouncil, set up last August (CI No 992) and administered by Los Altos-basedconsultant Omri Serlin.andP;  Counting both IBM and DEC are among its 27 members,the council is currently investigating ways of standardising the Debit/Creditbenchmark, in order to rule out exactly the kind of inconsistencies thatprovide both sides with continuing rounds of ammunition.andP;  Best news of all,however, is that IBM plans to offer its RAMP-C banchmark to the council as astandard, enabling its undoubted performance measurement capabilities to beadopted as a practical, working standard by all players.andM;NIXDORF, 3NET, SYSTEM WIZARDS, UNIVERSITY COLLEGE TEAMandM;TO TIE OPEN OFFICES TO ISDNandM;3Net Ltd, System Wizards SRL, Nixdorf Computer AG and University CollegeLondon are to begin work on a project backed by the European StrategyProgramme for Research and Development in Information Technology, Esprit, inan attempt to evolve ISDN support for Open Systems Interconnection servicesin office environments.andP;  The three-year project, entitled Primary RateISDN/OSI Office Facilites, Proof, hopes to have a message and documenthandling service using a combination of Ethernet networks connected bygateways across ISDN networks.andP;  The team will first research within theframework of open standards, attempting to upgrade primary rate capabilitiesof available PABXs to achieve ISDN circuit bandwidths beyond 64Kbps.andP;  It thenhopes to develop a gateway that uses these PABX capablities to interconnectOpen Systems-conformant office-based local area networks, terminals andservers via primary rate ISDN, and the addition of a primary rate interfaceto a Unix server.andP;  The gateway will be developed to provide connectionbetween an ISDN PABX to an Ethernet local network, with the potential toconnect to other local and packet switched wide area networks.andP;  The projectalso hopes to come up with an extension of the Open Systems environment to anexternal server and workstations connected to a gateway via the ISDN PABX.andO;Basingstoke, Hampshire-based 3Net is embarking on the project in the hope ofdeveloping its networking infrastructure and local network tools towardsEuropean standards; it says that without Esprit, such efforts would not havegot off the ground, and hopes for interim products next year in localnetworks and gateways.andP;  For its part Nixdorf hopes its Munich work willbenefit the company's PABX offerings, while Ivrea, Italy-based software houseSystem Wizards will work on a number of software applications for theproject.andP;  Esprit aims to further European collaboration through funding ofpre-competitive research projects; the Proof project is part of the secondround Esprit II funding programme, following completion of the first, begunin 1984.andM;HEWLETT TO INCLUDE LAN MANAGER FOR UNIX IN ITS NEXT -andM;CONVERGING - HP-UX RELEASEandM;Hewlett-Packard Co is preparing the release of a new version of its HP/UXUnix operating system for release during the second half of 1989, accordingto a report in HP Chronicle-Europe - and it should incoprorate theHewlett-Packard - Microsoft LAN Manager - LM/X, which will enable MS-DOS andOS/2 micros to share HP9000 resources and peripherals with no additionalsoftware.andP;
