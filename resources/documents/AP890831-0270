(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   American Savings Bank, which attractedthousands of customers with relatively low credit card interestrate, has bumped the rate by nearly 4 percentage points.   ``I feel like I've been sucker-punched,'' said David Montoya, aSan Mateo energy consultant who said he was drawn to American's lowcredit card interest rate a year ago. ``That's simply an awesomeincrease.''   However, the Stockton-based thrift said the increase is necessaryto keep its operation competitive.   ``We've heard few complaints,'' said American spokeswoman LaynaBrowdy.   Browdy said that more than 50 percent of the bank's customers payoff their credit card balance every month, so they are not affectedby the rate hike.   The once-insolvent American Savings andamp; Loan, which changed itsname to American Savings Bank after Texas billionaire Robert M. Bassacquired it last year, boosted its credit card loans eightfold inthe past two years by offering Visa holders a relatively low 15percent interest rate.   But last month American raised the rate almost 4 percentagepoints to 18.9 percent. The increase is retroactive, applying notonly to new purchases but also to unpaid balances.   ``That seems immoral,'' Montoya said.   But it is legal. Only a few states, such as Delaware, Georgia,Montana and New Jersey, have laws prohibiting lenders from applyinga new interest rate to an existing balance, and only if the customerstops using the card. If a customer makes a charge after the newrate takes effect, the entire balance is subject to the new rate.   American's credit card operation is the second fastest-growing inthe state, after Glendale Federal Savings.   American's credit card loans jumped to $66.4 million by the endof 1988 from $8 million in 1986.   Still, it is a relatively small operation considering Citibank's$21.8 billion in credit-card loans.</TEXT></DOC>
