<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-24-1234 </DOCNO><TEXT>An application of a fundamental thermochemical approach that relates theaqueous concentrations of elements to specific chemical reactions inwaste/water systems is described. The approach involves the concept ofwaste as consisting of mixtures of discrete solids (pure solid phasesand solid solution phases) that control aqueous concentrations of individualsolutes through their solubilization or adsorption/desorption characteristics.Thermochemical data can then be used in conjunction with knowledge ofthe specific solid phases present in the wastes to calculate the aqueousconcentrations of elements. This approach does not explicitly considerspecific rates of kinetically controlled reactions but does incorporateempirical knowledge of the relative rates of several reaction types.Overall, the thermochemical approach is applicable to all waste typesand environments, and is appropriate because (1) most waste solids thateither are present or are expected to form during weathering have relativelyrapid precipitation/dissolution kinetics, and (2) experimental results,enrichment of many constituents on particle surfaces, and the large specificsurface areas of wastes suggest that many of the constituents presentin the wastes are accessible to solution attack and are mobilized fairlyrapidly. Supporting evidence for the successful application of this approachto predicting pore-water concentration of several major and trace elementsin utility wastes is discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
