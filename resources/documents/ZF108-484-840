Denning.andP;  In addition to exploring thesociopolitical, ethical, and legal issues surrounding the Internet wormincident, this book collects some of the most informative, provocative, andfrightening reports on the vulnerability of computer systems to harmfulattacks.andP;  The second book is Spectacular Computer Crime by the formerchairman of ACM's Legal Issues Committee, Jay J. BloomBecker.andP;  BloomBecker'sbook provides a fascinating compilation of the best computer-assisted crimesof the last twenty years.andP;  Except for the Morris escapade, I view thesecrimes as computer-assisted because none of the crimes are really new -- justordinary fraud, theft, and embezzlement.andP;  The crimes were assisted, however,by user-friendly (or, at least, crime-naive) computer systems.andM;Take for example the case of Harold Smith and Sammie Marshall.andP;  Between 1976and 1981, they embezzled $21.3 million from Wells Fargo Bank.andP;  The fraud wasnothing but standard old check kiting.andP;  Check kiting is cashing a check on anaccount whose only deposit is a check that has not cleared yet and thencovering the draft on the other account with another rubber check from thefirst bank, which is covered by a rubber check from the second bank, etc.,andO;etc.andP;  This can go on indefinitely.andP;  It is a game that anyone can play.andP;  Amajor national brokerage house was recently fined by the federal governmentfor doing the same thing on a massive scale.andP;  Smith and Marshall played thegame from inside the bank.andP;  Instead of using ordinary checks, they used thebank's branch settlement system to keep a steadily growing mountain of fraudin circulation within the branch settlement system.andM;Except for Morris' electronic version of breaking and entering, computercrime is just the same old criminal game being played with new equipment.andO;What is it that provides the special allure of repackaging old crimes in newdigital wrapping?andM;There is a parallel world to our physical world -- the world insidecomputers.andP;  The application systems that run on computers usually copy theinformation processing activities of real people who did the job at some timein the past.andP;  Some systems, expert systems, even try to exactly duplicate thethinking processes of particular individuals who did the job.andP;  Like the movieTRON, the people may be gone, but their ghostly images still carry on theirjobs in the abstracted world inside the computer.andM;Unlike TRON, there are no police roaming the parallel world like white cellsin your body, responding to calls for help and destroying unauthorizedinvaders.andP;  In most systems, rogue programs can steal time, extort space, andexplore the channels until a human being at a terminal notices somethingwrong and begins to hunt down the interloper (see the story of &quot;Stalking theWily Hacker,&quot; originally told in the May 1988 issue of Communications of theACM and recounted in the Denning book).andM;These two books tell a cautionary tale.andP;  They should be read by allprofessionals who rely on computers to handle anything of value -- corporatemanagers, auditors, and accountants, as well as systems designers anddevelopers.andP;  Computer systems replicate the information processing tasks ofthe people they replaced, but they infrequently have any of the &quot;commonsense&quot; of the people they replaced.andP;  Corporate managers, as well as systemsdevelopers, should understand how easily criminals can penetrate the parallelworld to carry out electronic capers.andP;  Systems developers should appreciatethe consequences of not designing security features into a system -- even ifit is simply the ability to call the &quot;systems police&quot; when something lookssuspicious.andM;With few notable exceptions, computer crimes are the same crimes that havebeen practiced for thousands of years.andP;  Systems developers need to rememberthat everything old in crime can happen again in their systems.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
