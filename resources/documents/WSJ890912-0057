The prospective buyers are Lloyd Arnold, Christo D. Bardis, Frank Ramos and Buzz Oates. Mr. Arnold and Mr. Bardis, an attorney, are involved in harness racing; Messrs. Ramos and Oates are real estate developers.    In an interview, Mr. Ramos said the group plans to spin off the track to Messrs. Arnold and Bardis, who would operate it. Then the group would begin working to develop the adjacent property, 160 acres in Cypress, Calif.    According to the agreement, the property would be sold on an &quot;as is&quot; basis. Early this year, a Newport Beach, Calif., concern agreed to buy the package for $96 million, but contingent on a favorable vote by Cypress citizens to rezone the adjacent land from public to mixed-use business park. Voters defeated the rezoning plan, so the transaction was derailed.    Mr. Ramos said his group would take its chances. &quot;We'll try to work with the city,&quot; he said.    Another group associated with quarterhorse racing, which also takes place at the racetrack, was the other final bidder for the property. </TEXT></DOC>
