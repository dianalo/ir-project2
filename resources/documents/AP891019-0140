We want to help the people ofSouth Africa,'' British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said whileunder attack from fellow Commonwealth leaders, her officialsreported.   Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke, expressing disappointmentat a new agreement by international banks to reschedule SouthAfrican debt, proposed the Commonwealth press foreign banks tosqueeze the white-run government's trade financing.   Hawke, acknowledging reforms by South Africa's President F.W. deKlerk, stopped short of seeking a wider boycott of South Africanexports under his plan that would take effect after six months.   ``It would be churlish not to acknowledge there have been somerecent changes,'' Hawke said. But he added the ``fundamentals ofapartheid'' remained.   The leaders of the Commonwealth, the 49-nation association ofBritain and its former colonies, will consider the Australian planthis weekend. South Africa quit the organization in 1961.   The debt rescheduling, announced Wednesday, of $8 billion ofSouth Africa's $20 billion debt by foreign banks enraged someAfrican leaders. Zambia's Kenneth Kaunda denounced the banks,mostly American and European, as ``bloodsuckers.''   In Zambia, the guerrilla-backed African National Congress, themain organization fighting the South African government, onThursday condemned international banks for the rescheduling,calling it ``an act of inhumanity and as a means of helping toperpetuate the evil system of apartheid.''   Hawke said his proposal, jointly sponsored by Canada, wassupported by most of the other heads of government in the largelyThird World organization.   Britain, the largest foreign investor in South Africa, agreed tojoin a 10-nation committee of foreign ministers charged withdrawing up the summit's final declaration on South Africa.   But Mrs. Thatcher, the sole opponent of sanctions, rejected anytougher measures or giving South Africa a deadline to endapartheid, the system which disenfranchises the black majority.   ``No one in this room would take instructions or acceptultimata,'' a British official quoted her as telling the summitduring the closed debate on South Africa.   ``She said she found it strange to be a member of a conferencewhich spent its time trying to increase poverty. In so far assanctions work, they increase poverty,'' added the official,speaking on condition of anonymity.   On the debt rescheduling, she commented that banks ``have a dutyto their shareholders'' to recover debts.   Without rescheduling, South Africa may have defaulted orsuspended repayments.   Hawke said the terms of debt rescheduling agreement were harsh,noting that South Africa must repay $1.5 billion by the end of1993. Anti-apartheid campaigners said South Africa had a betterdeal than severely indebted Mexico.   Under the Australian plan, the Commonwealth would call oninternational banks to restrict South African trade credits to amaximum of 90 days and to make it harder for South Africa to getcredit or insurance.   The proposal also endorses an African-supported blueprint forchange stipulating negotiations with the African National Congress.Mrs. Thatcher objects to that, too.   Hawke proposed the Commonwealth investigate InternationalMonetary Fund help of ``post-apartheid South Africa.''   He said a Commonwealth committee will meet again in April andreview developments in South Africa, including whether de Klerklifted the state of emergency, stopped hanging people forpolitically inspired crimes, shown willingness to abolish basicapartheid laws and freed black leader Nelson Mandela.   Hawke said the summit did not, however, set out specificconditions that South Africa must fulfill by then.   South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha said it is``irrelevant'' what is decided by such a conference, some of whosemember countries ``have never seen an election in their wholehistory, many of whom don't have independent judiciaries, many ofwhom have state-controlled presses.''   The Commonwealth in 1986 adopted 11 non-binding sanctions,including bans on air links, new investment, and imports ofagricultural products, iron, steel, coal and uranium. Britainstrongly resisted the idea of a list but eventually applied ahandful of measures.   Countries neighboring South Africa, including Commonwealthmembers Zimbabwe, Zambia and Botswana, support sanctions by othercountries but refuse to impose them because South Africa is theirleading trade partner.   The Commonwealth countries that impose sanctions tend to be onesthat never have had extensive contact with South Africa, such asCanada, Nigeria and Caribbean and Asian nations.</TEXT></DOC>
