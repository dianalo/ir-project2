Accordingto the Waste Water Emission Law (AbwAG) and Water Economy Law (WHG),the analytical monitoring of waste water pipes in the main canal arein the channel system with a subsequent sewage plant is urgently required.Atomic absorption spectrometry is ideally suited for this analysis, withthe atomising devices of a flame graphite furnace hydride technique coldvapour technique. Atomic absorption spectrometry is laid down as theinstrumented analysis process in various DIN processes for waste wateranalysis. A decision making scheme is introduced with the help of whichit is possible to find the right AAS process regarding atomisation.</TEXT></DOC>
