However, the French government is encountering harsh criticismat home from some political figures who say it bears partialresponsibility for the attack by encouraging massive arms sales toIraq over the past decade.   A former national intelligence director, Pierre Marion, said inan interview published Monday that France provided Iraq withone-fourth of its military arsenal while pursuing a ``shortsighted,incoherent'' Middle East policy. The sales earned an estimated $5billion for France, which trailed only the Soviet Union as Iraq'sbiggest arms supplier.   France's neighbors haven't echoed such criticisms, and theFrench delegation played a leading role at the weekend meeting inRome of the European Community, which voted for an embargo onimports of Iraqi oil.   The community's 12 member countries also voted to freeze Iraqiand Kuwaiti assets.   Switzerland, not a member of the European Community, NATO or anyother political alliance, demonstrated the broad consensus on theIraq-Kuwait conflict today, announcing it would break from itstraditional policy of not taking part in international embargoes.   Switzerland said it would follow the lead of the U.N. SecurityCouncil and ban all trade with Iraq and Iraqi-occupied Kuwait. Italso prohibited all payments and other financial transfers to Iraqand Kuwait.   Switzerland had refused to join the U.N.-endorsed sanctionscampaigns against Rhodesia and South Africa.   Sweden, Norway and Denmark also announced today they wereimposing a complete trade embargo against Iraq and Kuwait.   In Britain, Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said Monday thecrisis in the Persian Gulf had produced a rare degree of unity,transcending customary alliances. In contrast to some recentforeign policy issues, his government has not found itself at oddswith any major allies.   The Iraqis ``have got themselves into a corner,'' Hurd toldBBC-TV. ``They did not expect the international community _ theRussians, Japanese, Europe, at our instance, the Americans _ tocome together so clearly and so soon against this act ofaggression.''   Britain's relations with Iraq had been strained severely sincethe March 15 execution by that country of Farzad Bazoft, an Iranianjournalist with the British newspaper, The Observer.   On March 28, British authorities announced the seizure of partsthat could be used in nuclear bomb triggers just before they wereput aboard an Iraq-bound airliner. In April, large pipes wereseized that Britain alleged were parts for an Iraqi ``super gun''project.   In France, the government responded quickly to the Iraqiinvasion by announcing a halt to all arms sales to Baghdad and anend to training of Iraqi fighter pilots. Officials said arms salesin fact had stopped in May because of problems arising from Iraq'sdebt to France of more than $4 billion. But the actions failed toward off criticism.   On Sunday, the head of France's Greens party, Antoine Waechter,said the government practiced ``blind diplomacy'' during the yearsof arms sales to Iraq.   ``France is partly responsible for what is happening today,,''Waechter said. ``France sold arms even when it was obvious thatIraq had this type of dominating, expansionist behavior.''   Marion, who in 1981-82 headed France's external intelligenceagency, told the Paris newspaper Le Figaro that France had soldIraq 210 Mirage warplanes and state-of-the art missiles.   Sales continued even after the Iran-Iraq war ended in 1988, hesaid.   Since early this year, Marion said, the French militarycontractor Thomson CSF has sold $160 million worth of electronicsequipment to Iraq that could be used to develop sophisticatedmilitary radar systems.   Four French companies have sold equipment that could be used toincrease the range and accuracy of Soviet-made Scud missilespossessed by Iraq, Marion was quoted as saying.   ``Because of the complaisant attitude which it had in the pasttoward Saddam Hussein... France today must have a bad conscienceand some regrets,'' said an editorial Monday in the Courrier del'Ouest, a newspaper in Angers.   In West Germany, there also has been extensive media criticismof allegedly illegal shipments by West German companies to Iraqover the past several years.   The news magazine Der Spiegel reported Saturday that Germancompanies have played central roles in helping Iraq with itsmilitary buildup. </TEXT></DOC>
