As previously reported, the natural-gas pipeline concern offered to acquire Calgary, Alberta-based Encor for about 980 million Canadian dollars ($744.1 million), or 8.75 dollars a share. Encor earlier this week said its board determined that the offer was &quot;inadequate from a financial point of view.&quot;    William Whelan, a senior vice president of Encor, said that the company &quot;has had expressions of interest&quot; from other possible suitors but that no talks are under way. He declined to elaborate.    Encor, an oil and gas producer, is 42%-owned by Dome Petroleum Ltd., Calgary.    In Toronto Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Encor closed at 8.50 dollars, up 12.5 cents.    The TransCanada offer, which expires Dec. 8, isn't being made to Encor's U.S. holders, but they can take advantage of the offer by placing orders to sell shares through Canadian securities firms. </TEXT></DOC>
