White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater announced the sale planand said the triggering of a 50-day process under which Congresscould block the proposed $1 billion sale was imminent.   The sale would be part of an administration policy of armingPersian Gulf nations endangered by attacks spilling over from the7-year-old Iran-Iraq war. Gulf states have also benefited from U.S.naval cover for tankers plying the oil routes.   Congressional opposition to the sale is likely, however, frommembers who have noted that Kuwait, like other Arab nations, istechnically in a state of war with Israel. Some lawmakers also havecomplained that U.S. arms sales to the region will contribute to analready-dangerous weapons buildup in the gulf, without enhancingU.S. security.   State Department officials met privately with members of theSenate Foreign Relations Committee on Thursday in an effort toallay some of those fears.   Richard W. Murphy, assistant secretary of state for Near Eastaffairs, said last month that the administration favored the saleof advanced aircraft to Kuwait, but Friday's announcement was thefirst on-the-record word that the F-A-18, produced by McDonnellDouglas, was chosen over other candidates.   F-A-18s, the newest jets in the U.S. Navy's carrier-basedarsenal, are twin-engine craft with the latest electronic guidancesystems. Kuwait chose these planes because they could hit targetsthroughout the gulf and could make a quick transition betweenbombing and interception missions.   Pentagon officials said also considered were F-16s, older planeswith dual capability but less versatility to change roles quickly,and the F-15, which is a high-performance fighter with limitedbomber capacity.   Only Australia, Canada and Spain _ all formal allies of theUnited States _ have been permitted to buy F-A-18s.   If Kuwait purchases all 40 planes authorized, the contract wouldbe worth about $1 billion for McDonnell Douglas, which competesheavily with the French makers of the Mirage 2000 jet.   A State Department arms expert said Friday that one of thearguments the administration could make to Congress is that ifKuwait is denied permission to buy F-A-18s, it will turn toMirages, giving the French manufacturer the profit.   Unlike Israel and Egypt, who purchase billions of dollars ofU.S. weapons with funds from the U.S. foreign aid budget, Kuwaitwould buy the F-A-18s with its own money.   The Kuwaitis also are reported to be ready to buy armaments thatcan be carried by F-A-18s and other U.S. planes: Maverickair-to-ground missiles, air-to-air Sidewinder missiles and Harpoonanti-ship missiles.   Under U.S. arms sale law, the administration sends an``informal'' notice to Capitol Hill of its intention to sellweapons to a particular country. Then 20 days later, formal noticeis given and Congress has 30 days to block the transfer if bothhouses concur.</TEXT></DOC>
