However, the rate increase came late enough in the peak summer selling season that the housing industry is still likely to turn in a strong year, analysts and housing industry and real estate professionals say.    The prevailing rate on 30-year fixed-rate loans purchased by Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. jumped to 10.82% yesterday from 10.50% Monday, and many adjustable-rate mortgages linked to short-term indexes are climbing past 10.6%, compared with 10.35% at the beginning of the month.    But although scores of lenders raised their mortgage rates after the Fed raised its discount rate -- the fee it charges on loans to financial institutions -- to 6 1/2% from 6%, lenders and real estate sales people said they expect the immediate impact to be slight.    In addition to the timing of the increases, economists and real estate sales professionals say adjustable-rate mortgages that often are initially priced below market levels continue to put a floor under sales and make the industry less sensitive to rate fluctuations. Moreover, many prospective home buyers have commitments from lenders for loans at the lower rates that prevailed in June and July.    &quot;The rates haven't affected the market,&quot; said Vincent Aquilino, a real estate broker at Spindrift Gallery of Homes in Shrewsbury, N.J. He said sales are still brisk, with Spindrift's sales of 13 homes so far this week comparing favorably with activity earlier in the summer.    In San Diego, &quot;we really aren't affected by the increase,&quot; said Art S. Leitch, president of Leitch Realtors. He said consumer traffic hasn't fallen off and that he doesn't expect it to in the near future.    Other sales people are using the rate increase to drum up business by telling consumers that now is the time to buy before rates increase further. In Sleepy Eye, Minn., the tactic seems to be working. &quot;Traffic is up,&quot; says Joseph Broich, president of Broich-Martinka Realty Inc.    Lenders similarly report that loan volume hasn't fallen off. They attribute the buyer steadiness to commitments they offer consumers, as many lenders promise to lock in rates for as long as 60 days.    Many housing specialists, however, warn that by September and through the rest of the year, interest rates -- which are expected to continue their rise in the autumn -- will start to slow sales of new and existing homes as well as home construction. The National Association of Home Builders, for example, scaled back its estimate of 1988 total housing starts to 1,450,000 from 1,480,000.    One ominous sign for sales is that adjustable rates based on short-term indexes have risen more rapidly than fixed rates. The spread between 30-year fixed rates and the most popular kind of adjustable-rate loan has narrowed to about 20 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, from more than 60 points in May. The housing market has increasingly relied on cheaper adjustable-rate mortgages to maintain its momentum.    Nonetheless, housing is turning in another robust year so far, despite an increase of nearly 1.1 percentage points in 30-year rates from their low point in February. Many economists expect single-family starts to exceed a million for the sixth year in a row, which would be a record matched only by the housing boom of the early 1960s.    In June, the latest month for which statistics are available, sales of existing homes hit a year's high at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3,780,000, up 19% from January. New homes sold at a rate of 734,000, up 27% from January's level.    ---                     Mortgage Rates Rise                            30-YEAR*         ARMs** Feb. 19                       9.74          9.65 March 4                       9.79          9.13 March 18                      9.76          9.22 April 1                      10.11          9.26 April 15                     10.15          9.51 May 2                        10.29          9.53 May 16                       10.29          9.73 May 31                       10.51          9.90 June 16                      10.17          9.85 July 1                       10.39         10.02 July 15                      10.44         10.29 July 29                      10.49         10.35 Aug. 11                      10.82         10.62   *Indicated rates for consumers, for loans sold to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.   **Assumes 2 1/2 percentage point spread above the one-year Treasury note's weekly average rate; Aug. 11 figure is preliminary, based on the first three days of the week.
