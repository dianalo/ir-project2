Engineers conducting a test loading of hydrogen rocket fuel intothe propellant tank of space shuttle Atlantis found the second leakearly Friday morning. A similar leak found on Columbia last monthforced postponement of its astronomy mission.   NASA spaceflight chief Bill Lenoir said Atlantis, which had beenscheduled for launch in mid-July, now will be rolled back to thehangar so engineers can remove its fuel tank and try to locate theleak.   Columbia's leak also was found while it was on the launch pad,just six hours before its scheduled May 30 liftoff. It, too, wasrolled back to the hangar.   Lenoir said the agency had no choice but to keep the spaceshuttle fleet on the ground until the problem is fixed. Hedesignated Leonard Nicholson, deputy director of the space shuttleprogram at NASA headquarters in Washington, to take charge of theleak investigation.   ``We can't fly until we can get hydrogen into the tank and we'renot going to put hydrogen in the tank until we can do it safely andwe've got a problem getting over that hump right now,'' Lenoir saidin a news conference at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.   Lenoir said he ``would hesitate to use the word grounded'' inreference to the shuttle fleet, but he added: ``There's no questionthat we won't fly until we understand it (the leak), have it fixed,have tested it, verified it and we're ready.''   The NASA executive said that the leak problem could be resolvedin two weeks, but that it could take longer if engineers determinea new design is needed for what is called the ``umbilical'' of thespace shuttle. This is an assembly of pipes and valves that directsthe flow of propellants into the tank from a ground supply and, atlaunch, from the tank to the shuttle engines.   Crews drained liquid hydrogen from the shuttle tanks and leftthem open to evaporate any remaining hydrogen before a purge withinert helium to carry away any remnant.   The vertical service structure was to be wrapped around theshuttle on Saturday pending further work on Monday.   NASA launched space shuttle missions in February and April andwas planning for six more this year. Atlantis' mid-July mission wasto be a secret military flight. Columbia's mission in May was to bea 10-day flight with a cargo of astronomical instruments. Thatmission was postponed until August. Other flights had been set forAugust, October, November and December.   But the hydrogen leak problem already was causing a reshufflingof the schedule and some missions seem certain to slip into nextyear.   Lenoir said the first priority is correcting the leak to assurethe safety of the space shuttles.   ``If that costs us a flight, I'm sorry,'' he said.   Even as engineers were searching for the shuttle leak, otherNASA officials were being grilled in a Senate hearing about thefocusing flaw discovered this week in the $1.5 billion Hubble SpaceTelescope.   Sen. Al Gore, D-Tenn., suggested at the hearings that NASA hadnot maintained a good system of quality control and was moreinterested in getting funds for new projects than efficientlycompleting projects already underway.   ``NASA's eyes are bigger than its stomach,'' Gore charged.   On the Hubble problem, the senator noted, ``We have been assurednow for 12 years that everything was all right. We owe it to thetaxpayers to find out what went wrong, how to fix it and make sureit never happens again.''   In Florida, Lenoir said that because the hydrogen leaks onColumbia and Atlantis occurred while the vehicles were being fueledon the launch pad, ``it seems likely that these are related and ofa similar class.''   This puts into question the safety of the umbilical system onDiscovery, the third shuttle.   Discovery is scheduled to carry a science spacecraft calledUlysses into orbit in October. A delay in that mission could causethe craft to not be launched for years because its success dependsupon the alignment of other planets. Ulysses is scheduled to gointo a polar orbit of the sun.   Robert Crippen, chief of the shuttle office at NASA, said theleaks are coming from umbilical parts that have proven reliablethrough 31 shuttle flights. Liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen arethe propellants used in the space shuttles' main rocket engines.</TEXT></DOC>
