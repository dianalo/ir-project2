The $20 million test, the last of six qualifying tests, wasdesigned to show the strength of the rocket's casing and thebehavior of its solid-fuel propellant, which hasn't as much``oomph'' in cold weather, Mitchell said.   Early test data showed the propellant's burn rate was normal forthe conditions and there was no evidence of the uneven burning thatcould have occurred at that temperature, he said.   The horizontal 126-foot-long booster, its 1.1 million pounds ofpropellant chilled to a coldest-ever 40 degrees, was fired for 125seconds at the company's Wasatch Operations center 25 miles west ofhere.   The bright orange plume from the rocket's tail melted the snowfrom a nearby hillside during the test, which was delayed for 90minutes by a lack of wind to blow away dust from the blast. About300 company and space officials cheered as the rocket ignited.   If post-test analysis turns up no serious problems, theexperiment will qualify the rocket for cold-weather launches,although further testing on a smaller scale is planned, said AllanMcDonald, vice president of engineering for space operations.   Identical boosters already have been used on two shuttle flightsin the four months since America's return to manned space flight.   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration ordered MortonThiokol to redesign the booster after a Jan. 28, 1986, explosiondestroyed the shuttle Challenger and killed its seven astronauts.   NASA required only five qualifying tests before the shuttleprogram resumed with the launch of Discovery on Sept. 29. Theshuttle Atlantis was sent into space Dec. 2, and in both cases theboosters performed with no problems.   A presidential commission blamed the Challenger disaster on abooster joint that allowed a plume of superhot gas to burn throughan O-ring, triggering the explosion of the craft's liquid fuel tank.   Investigators also found that freezing temperatures the nightbefore the launch stiffened the joint's rubber-like O-ring seal,causing it to lose pliability and contributing to the failure.</TEXT></DOC>
