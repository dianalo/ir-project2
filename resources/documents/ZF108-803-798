Foreign trade was carried on by large state trading companies,and local computer makers operated in a relatively protected market.andP;  Minisare more prevalent here than elsewhere, but government protectionism ratherthan CoCom limited their number.andM;NevgoslaviaandM;Now all that has changed.andP;  The dinar is convertible, pegged to the Germanmark.andP;  Typical pc prices have dropped in the last couple of years from 12000DM to 3000 DM, or from $7000 to $2000 (after allowing for a devastatinginflation that lives on in four extra 0000s on most banknotes), and clonesare common.andP;  The state's big electronics company, Iskra, has now more or lessdisintegrated, leading to erosion of market share for DEC, which itrepresented.andP;  (DEC is now gaining share back through other channels.andP;  IBMfared better with its partner, software/service-oriented Intertrade, page 16,but even for Intertrade increasing competition poses a threat.) Growth in theinstalled base of all kinds of computers makes software a promising business,but custom programs are still generally a better business than packages rightnow for copyright reasons.andP;  Likewise, most vendors prefer to sell turnkeysystems rather than just the software, because that way they can get thecustomers to pay for both.andP;  We sell 500 solutions a year,&quot; says managingdirector Branko Car of Tera in Zagreb, one of the four dealers recentlysigned up by Compaq and an eager student of US marketing talk as well as ofRussian and German.andM;Iskra and Intertrade are exceptions in a country of mostly mid-sized and nowsmaller firms.andP;  The few we describe below are representative, although at thetop end of the quality scale.andP;  They are generally more mature than thoseelsewhere in Central Europe and the Soviet Union; Yugoslavia is the onlyplace where dealers routinely dedicate individuals to telephone customersupport - perhaps because the telephones work a little better here.andP;  Giventhe base of mid-size firms, there's a profusion of accounting and smallbusiness systems lacking in other parts of Central Europe, and a lot ofdevelopment is done in COBOL.andP;  Pcs have long been available through tradingcompanies, which don't provide much support, and are now also available toanyone willing to take a day trip north, as well as through an increasingnumber of dealers with direct ties to foreign vendors.andM;Tera: Early in, still hereandM;Tera is the closest thing to a traditional dealership, started 40 years agoas a state-owned firm selling typewriters.andP;  &quot;We've been around for 40 yearsand we plan to be around another 40,1' says Car, who once worked for Siemensand joined the small firm after getting fed up with the lengthy series ofdelays and buck-passing in job interviews with a large state electronicscompany.andP;  He has grown the business to $14 million in revenues last year,without much help or interference from the state, reinvesting the surplus ina network of seven branches.andP;  The company built its own 8088-style micro andsold 800 of them over the years, but now it resells foreign-made products andhas just signed on as one of four new Compaq dealers in Yugoslavia.andP;  TheCompaq line is attractive, says Car, because it is leading-edge technologyand will support Tera's move to multi-user systems with UNIX.andM;Tera's basic business is general-business systems and software on pcs and aline of dedicated smart printers for bus tickets, bank statements and thelike.andP;  It also sells a dedicated word-processing system with its own softwarecalled Ed3 for 4000DM (about $2300).andP;  When Tera worked on the IA Olympicswith ABC, it got its network up faster than anyone else after a power outage.andO;&quot;We're used to such things,&quot; says software manager Damir Gluhak.andM;SRC: Better business through chemistry SRC, by contrast, has a narrower,higher-end customer base growing out of its past as the systems arm of agovernment chemical outfit in Ljubljana.andP;  Former banker Ivan Zerko joinedKemija, the chemical company, to manage its dataprocessing operations sixyears ago.andP;  The company was an amalgamation of five units to whom Zerko hadto sell his services.andP;  He acquired a used 4341 to do heavy-duty processingand also built an information center, with standard packages for end-usersand user training.andP;  Now the company has expanded into the modern buildingnext door, where it runs a cheerful training center.andM;SRC almost inadvertently became a distributor for ADR's Datacom, which itoriginally Wanted to license just for internal use.andP;  ADR wanted to providelocal support, so SRC took on the job.andP;  The first year we did nothing, butthe second year we sold four licenses,&quot; says Zerko, now general director.andO;For a mainframe package at $200,000 each, that wasn't bad.andP;  The next year,Computer Associates bought ADR from Ameritech, and the relationship ended.andO;&quot;But,&quot; says Zerko,  we had gained a good reputation,&quot; which subsequentlyenabled it to earn reseller contracts from SAS Institute, WordStar, ComputerSystems Advisers (the POSE CASE tool), Lotus and ultimately Novell and Compaq- whose machines it started to use when it found that the graphics-intensiveSAS software wouldn't run on clones or even on Intertrade's IT/PS/2s.andP;  As oneof the larger software package resellers in the country, SRC has been activein supporting copyright legislation, and is helping to organize theestablishment of an independent agency to foster the application of copyrightlaws, a sort of Yugoslavian Business Software Association.andP;  SRC had revenuesof $2.3 million last year and is hoping to reach $3.9 million this year, nowthat it has started selling Compaq.andP;  It has 50 people overall.andM;Compaq's other two dealers in Yugoslavia are Mikrohit of Ljubljana andMicroLAB of Zagreb, which we have not visited yet.andP;  Stay tuned...andM;Unicom: A node of expertsandM;Unicom is a free-standing programming house of eleven people  - small and itwants to stay that way.andP;  It's a collection of highly skilled people whodesign and install high-end network systems for anyone from Adria Airways(the regional competitor to the Yugoslavian national airline) to the statebank.andM;One current job is for Merkur, a trading company, which needs to network themainframe in its warehouse to its headquarters and four other locations up to35 kilometers away, using fiber optics.andP;  The company was founded a year agoby three people from the government computer center in Ljubljana with 2000Deutschmarks and one signed contract for 60,000 DM ($36,000).andP;  once theyleft, the center had no resources to do such high-end work, explainscofounder Matjaz Lenassi, and so Unicom is picking up much of its businessand potential business, with the center's grudging consent (or perhapsenvy?).andP;  Unicom distributes for Ashton-Tate and Persoft and is negotiatingwith Gandalf, a heavy-duty communications equipment supplier.andP;  Findingdealers is easy, says Lenassi; since the laws allowed private enterprisesabout 3000 companies have started up in Slovenia alone.andP;  Of those, about halfare involved with computers in some way, but only a quarter of that half havemore than one person.andP;  Unicom earned $500,000 on revenues of $1.8 million inthe first half of 1989, says Lenassi.andM;Belgrade also has Ibis Sys, long a value-added reseller and high-end softwarehouse for Germany's Mannesmann Kienzle computers and printers, which it hasmanaged to lead to a winning market position in southern Yugoslavia.andP;  IbisSys makes a point of its obsession with quality, and proudly proclaims thatit is not the cheapest supplier in the market  - a courageous, novelapproach.andP;  Although it's 15 years old, the company emphasizes hiring andtraining young employees; overall, the average age is under 30.andP;  More thanthat, says marketing manager Mihail Petreski, &quot;A lot of time we even work onSaturdays! Ibis Sys has managed to prosper with a demanding customer base ofbanks and post offices, competing against more powerful government firms.andO;Now, of course, this tough training should enable it to continue to prosperin the even more competitive times ahead.andP;  Revenues exceeded $8 million lastyear, with only about 150 people.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
