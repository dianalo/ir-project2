December delivery gold declined $2.20 an ounce to $365.40. December silver was off 4.5 cents an ounce to $5.165. October platinum was down $5.70 an ounce to $473.50.    &quot;Tuesday's rally is but a fond memory,&quot; said one analyst. &quot;Under present conditions, precious metals aren't able to withstand any kind of selling pressure.&quot; Gold is nearing its low point of the past 12 months, set in June.    In London, dealers said a marked increase in Soviet sales is depressing gold's price.    &quot;The Russians were very active during the past few weeks,&quot; a Swiss bullion dealer said. The Soviets haven't only sold from production, he said, but also have &quot;lent&quot; gold to the market from their huge monetary reserves.    The Soviet Union is the second-largest producer in the world and this year's sales have risen about 25% to an annual rate of around 7.3 million ounces, estimated Jeffrey Nichols, managing director of APMA {Canada} Ltd., a Toronto-based precious metals consulting firm. He figured that the Soviet's monetary gold reserves are 70 million to 80 million ounces and loans to the market effectively add to the supply of gold.    Moreover, the Bank of China is selling gold, too, said Edwin Arnold, metals analyst at Merrill Lynch Pierce Fenner andamp; Smith in London. China's sales could have reached around 3.5 million ounces since the June political crisis, Mr. Arnold said.    Both nations are selling gold because they are desperate for foreign exchange, dealers said.    A sharp increase in Soviet sales early February helped push gold downward through $400 in February. The Soviet Union then reduced its offerings until the coal miners' strike a few weeks ago. The Soviet government raised salaries and benefits to end the walkout. The strike and settlement created such financial pressure on the nation that on some days gold sales ranged from 161,000 ounces to 320,000 ounces, Mr. Nichols of APMA {Canada} said.    &quot;The Soviets have a reputation for savvy trading,&quot; Mr. Nichols said, &quot;but sales were sloppy because gold was offered at any price.&quot;    Sales targets appear to be set weekly to correlate with the country's immediate hard currency needs, he said.    The Soviets have also been selling call options, which are promises to deliver gold in the future at preset prices, Mr. Nichols said. Selling calls provides additional current income, he said.    Soviet gold offerings are soaring despite $3 billion in foreign bank borrowings in the first quarter, estimated the Bank for International Settlements.    But, besides intermittent crises such as coal strikes and ecological disasters, the Soviet Union still needs to sell gold and other commodities to finance higher grain and industrial imports, dealers said.    Pressure for economic reform will also lead to higher imports, which in turn must partly be financed by larger gold sales during coming years, a Swiss banker said.    Yet, instead of placing the gold on the free market, Mr. Nichols said, there could be direct Soviet transactions with foreign central banks that need the gold.    Considering the size of the sales, the performance of the gold price is encouraging, Mr. Arnold said. Some London dealers are also hoping that jewelry fabricators will absorb more gold by increasing orders ahead of Christmas.    Others contend that fabricators have sufficient supplies. Also, Asian demand, which was buoyant in the first half, is waning, pessimistic dealers said.    Gold-bullion imports by Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore fell to 261 tons in the second quarter of 1989 from 383 tons in the first quarter and 317 tons in the fourth quarter of 1988, estimated Commodities Research Unit, a London consulting firm.    In other commodity markets yesterday:    COPPER: Futures prices continued to recover from Tuesday's plunge. The December contract ended with a gain of 3.35 cents a pound at $1.2895. Prices sagged below previous closes through most of the day on news that Peruvian miners had ended their strike, but prices rebounded in late trading. The Peruvian strike began on Aug. 14 and lasted 18 days. A union official was reported to have admitted the walkout hadn't been a success. One analyst observed that when all miners returned to work at the Toquepala mine earlier this week, it signaled the end of the nationwide strike, &quot;so it was no great surprise.&quot; However, he noted, &quot;The strike may be ended for now but all the problems and dissent remain to be settled. We'll be hearing from Peru again soon.&quot; In British Columbia, there were no official announcements on the Highland Valley mine strike negotiations, one analyst said. However, he noted, according to some terse comments by union leaders, both sides continue to be far apart and won't meet again until Tuesday. It may be late September before agreement is reached, unless both parties change their stands. &quot;In a nutshell,&quot; the analyst said, &quot;production problems still predominate.&quot; Little output is expected the rest of this year from the Bougainville mine in Papua New Guinea, the Highland Valley strike is dragging on, and Chilean miners at the Salvador mine are expected to go on strike today. &quot;If it isn't one thing, it's another,&quot; the analyst said. &quot;That's been the pattern for some time.&quot;    ENERGY: Crude oil continued the rally that began Wednesday, although futures prices fell back after the October contract price reached but failed to break beyond $19 a barrel. Spot prices of North Sea and Middle East crudes were up sharply 25 cents to 35 cents a barrel on European markets. Also, several U.S. refiners increased the prices they pay in the field for West Texas Intermediate by 25 cents to $18 a barrel after Phillips Petroleum Co. raised its postings twice -- one 25-cent increase was effective Wednesday and the other yesterday -- to reach that level for the U.S. benchmark crude. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, October West Texas Intermediate settled unchanged at $18.83 a barrel, but the November and December contracts were up eight cents and 11 cents a barrel, respectively. Petroleum-product futures also kept a bullish tone as many traders sought to square positions before taking a four-day holiday over the Labor Day weekend. Unleaded gasoline for September delivery, which expired at the closing, was down a fraction at 54.98 cents a gallon. But the September heating oil contract, also expiring, was up 0.71 cent to settle at 53.82 cents a gallon. Futures prices of gasoline and heating oil for October and November delivery increased 0.39 cent to 0.56 cent a gallon.    GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Soybean and corn futures prices rose on trading-floor rumors that an early frost in September across parts of the Farm Belt might keep these crops from reaching full maturity. The rumors spreading from trading pit to trading pit yesterday morning on the Chicago Board of Trade were unfounded, weather forecasters said, but they managed to move prices higher in pre-Labor Day weekend trading. Soybean futures contracts for November delivery gained 9.75 cents to close at $5.875 a bushel, and December corn futures rose three cents to close at $2.3675 a bushel. Harvey Freese, co-owner of Freese-Notis Weather Inc., Des Moines, Iowa, said, &quot;We don't see an imminent frost.&quot; He said frost typically descends on Midwestern growing regions in late September or in early October. An exceedingly wet spring in much of Ohio and parts of Indiana delayed corn planting there and could result in some of this crop not reaching full maturity before the first frost, he said. </TEXT></DOC>
