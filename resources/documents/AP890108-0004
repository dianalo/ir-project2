He's not conducting hisforeign policy that way.   Consider the following actions by the Reagan administration inthe past month:   _ Reagan met in New York with Soviet President Mikhail S.Gorbachev, who announced a decision to reduce the Red Army by500,000, helping redress the military imbalance that Reagan made acampaign issue in 1979 _ a decade ago.   _ Reagan on Dec. 15 authorized a dialogue with the PalestineLiberation Organization following statements by PLO Chairman YasserArafat renouncing the use of terrorism and accepting two U.N.resolutions that recognize the right of Israel to exist;   _ Reagan agreed, after holding out for years, to a Sovietproposal for a multinational human rights conference in Moscow. TheMoscow session would come in 1991, following similar meetings inParis and Copenhagen over the preceding two years.   Secretary of State George P. Shultz launched a diplomaticinitiative to curb the proliferation of chemical weapons, followingthe reported use of such poisons by Iraq in its war with Iran andIraq and reports that Libya had built a chemical weapons plant.   _ American forces bloodied the nose of Libyan leader MoammarGadhafi, the man Reagan loves to hate, as two U.S. F-14 Tomcatfighters shot down two Libyan MiG-23's that the Pentagon saysapproached with hostile intent.   That's an active foreign policy agenda, compared to that ofprevious recent presidents as they awaited their successors to takeoffice.   Two years ago, as Reagan was embroiled in the Iran-Contra affair,few predicted that he would close with such a flurry. But inDecember 1987, the man who had severely criticized previous armscontrols treaties signed one of his own, eliminating medium-rangeSoviet and American nuclear weapons.   And in May 1988, the president who five years earlier called theSoviet Union the ``Evil Empire'' traveled to Moscow to blessGorbachev's reforms.   In some of these instances, Reagan may have been reacting ratherthan acting. And many people believe that President-elect Bush,despite his denials, already has become the de facto president, withReagan spending much of his time in California.   One student of the presidency says the recent activism probablywould have been impossible if Mike Dukakis had defeated Bush.   ``If Dukakis had won, there would be less chance that he couldpull it off,'' said Samuel Kernell, a professor of political scienceat the University of California at San Diego.   ``What Reagan has done is likely to have been cleared by the Bushpeople and is not likely to be undone by Bush'' after Jan. 20, saidKernell.   And it is no coincidence that Reagan's activities have been inthe foreign rather than the domestic realm, said Kernell.   ``Foreign affairs is one area in which presidents can act more orless on their own,'' said Kernell. ``The only problem that they faceis that foreign leaders are less interested in them.   ``But for once it was in the Soviets' interest to continueworking with Reagan. That was probably helped by fact that Bush wasReagan's protege.''   One liberal critic of Reagan, John Steinbruner of the BrookingsInstitution in Washington, said that ``although there has been a setof events that gives great promise, I don't think the administrationinitiated them.''   ``This business about chemical weapons is driven by internationalevents,'' Steinbruner said. ``The Libyan plant was just finished andthe international conference was scheduled for a long time.   ``And clearly Gorbachev set the schedule for the troop reductionsin Europe.''   Despite the skepticism, Reagan's finale compares favorably withhis predecessors'.   President Carter, defeated by Reagan in November 1980, spent hislast 444 days preoccupied with the American hostages, who werereleased by Iran on the day Reagan took office.   President Gerald Ford, beaten by Carter in 1976, left littleimprint on U.S. foreign policy during his 29 months in office.   President Nixon spent his last months in office battling theWatergate scandal, which forced him to resign on Aug. 9, 1974.   President Johnson surprised the nation, and many of his closestadvisers, with the televised announcement in March 1968 that hewould not seek re-election, and spent last nine months in officefutilely seeking a solution to the Vietnam War.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Bryan Brumley covers national security issues forThe Associated Press.</TEXT></DOC>
