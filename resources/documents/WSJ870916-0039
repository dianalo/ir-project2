In a revised, 58-count indictment, a federal grand jury in White Plains, N.Y., accused Mr. Galanis and seven other men of fraudulently securing control of three Oakland, Calif.-based mutual funds: ISI Trust Fund, ISI Growth Fund and ISI Income Fund. Currently, all three funds are managed by Sigma Funds.    The indictment accuses the Galanis group of securing control of the mutual funds in 1986 by, among other things, concealing from the funds' boards that the group intended to use fund assets for its own purposes. The indictment contends that the Galanis group then defrauded investors in the mutual funds by having the funds buy from the group almost $3.9 million of securities at inflated prices.    Brian Barrett, Mr. Galanis's attorney, said the revised indictment, which he hadn't yet seen, seemed to be a &quot;refinement of the original case.&quot; He added that Mr. Galanis was innocent of the charges, as he was of the earlier ones.    If convicted, Mr. Galanis, 44 years old, faces a maximum 252 years in prison and $9.2 million in fines on the federal charges. He also faces state charges of tax-shelter fraud.    ISI Trust, the largest of the funds, had $105 million in assets at June 30, and about 11,000 shareholders. Authorities said the three ISI funds severed ties with the Galanis group in July 1986.    The revised indictment also charges that the Galanis group defrauded the Federal Home Loan Bank Board to secure control of Columbia Federal Savings Bank, Westport, Conn.    The indictment asserts that Mr. Galanis didn't disclose that the group intended to use the thrift for tax-shelter syndication and its own financing activities.    Earlier this year, Mr. Galanis was indicted on racketeering, tax-fraud and securities-fraud charges in connection with an oil and gas tax-shelter partnership. The venture allegedly passed more than $172 million in fraudulent partnership losses to 2,500 investors between 1982 and 1984. That indictment also accused the Galanis group of fraudulently securing control in 1984 of another bank, Heritage Bank andamp; Trust, Salt Lake City.    Six people have pleaded guilty in Galanis-related cases and are cooperating with the government. Last week, Douglas C. Adams of Austin, Texas, pleaded guilty in a federal court in White Plains to conspiracy and aiding and abetting the fraud in connection with the three ISI mutual funds.    Three others pleaded guilty in connection with the oil and gas shelter, and two in connection with the bribery of a former chairman of the defunct Peoples National Bank of Rockland County, Monsey, N.Y.    The revised indictment names two individuals in connection with the alleged ISI fraud who hadn't earlier been charged. They are Arthur D. Mason, 46, a Washington, D.C., attorney, and John Geanoulis, 38, of New York. He is a cousin of Mr. Galanis. Neither could be reached for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
