(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>C O L O R The Well-Appointed Studio If you've ever missed a feature, howeverwhimsical, in your color painting software, Studio/8 probably has it -- and50 more you didn't know you needed.andP;  BY SALVATORE PARASCANDOLO AND CARLOSDOMINGO MARTINEZandM;Is more necessarily better?andP;  As far as Studio/8 is concerned, it is.andP;  In itsfirst color paint program for the Mac, Electronic Arts has managed to pick upon features that, before Studio/8, you only wished existed in a paintpackage.andP;  Among the welcome tool additions is a Bezier tool for drawingsmooth, adjustable curves in the same fashion as in Adobe Illustrator andAldus FreeHand (see Figure 1).andP;  Similarly, the Polygon tool can drawadjustable shapes.andP;  But it doesn't stop there.andP;  You can add points to boththe Bezier and polygon outlines, which remain fully editable until you setthem in place.andP;  The resulting package is a smoothly working professional artshop where artists can realize on-screen what before existed only in theirimaginations.andP;  COLOR IT SMARTandM;Studio/8 does more with colors than a grenade in a paint store.andP;  The programexcels at helping you use, create, and manage colors, and takes on much ofthe dog work of dealing with the 16.8 million possible colors of the Mac II.andM;By design, Studio/8's default palette uses only 160 of the possible 256 colorsquares, so you've got all those empty slots to fill.andP;  Always available arepalettes with 16 grays, 256 grays, and Apple's 256 System colors.andP;  Threeconcentric rectangles in the tool palette display the current foreground,frame (border), and background colors.andP;  Clicking on any of these will pop upa color palette from which you can select a new color for that region.andM;We tend to think of a palette as a selection board.andP;  The artist knows that'sonly half its function.andP;  Its other use is as a tool for mixing colors.andO;Studio/8 integrates both functions exceptionally well with its Color Squareand Color Mixer resources, which allow you to pull color ranges and ad hocmixes into the working palette for each of your documents (see Figure 2).andO;The Color Square is a 14-x-14-cell matrix of colors that blend into eachother.andP;  Select a color from a basic subset or from anywhere in the matrix,drag it to one of the square's corners, and the program redraws the matrixwith a smooth transition from cell to cell.andP;  The Color Square will changecolor each time you drag.andP;  With a few drags, you can create and choose froman endless variety of related colors that you can select to use on theworking palette.andM;The Color Mixer lets you create your own sets of colors to bring into theworking palette.andP;  You select colors from two scrollable reservoirs andliterally mix them in a scratch-pad area by stroking with your brush,blending what's there into new colors.andP;  You can also modify any color in theworking palette.andM;Once you use a color you've created in the current document, the colorbecomes locked on the palette -- you cannot remove it.andP;  This well-intendedprotection prevents the inadvertent corruption of your existing image.andM;If you have several open documents that use different palettes, the programswitches to the right one automatically as you switch windows.andP;  Cutting andpasting between documents is facilitated by a Paste with Colors option, whichtransfers the colors of the image you're pasting to the working palette ofthe receiving document.andP;  You can thus paste in selections without theunwanted color shifts that can occur when an image comes under the control ofa different palette.andM;Beyond color, Studio/8 has other smart features like Draft Page, an area onwhich you can carry out experiments or construct new items without affectingyour main document.andP;  In one swoop you can paste  the main document's contentinto the draft page, and modify it, with the optional ability to see throughto your main document as if the  draft page were a clear drawing surface.andO;You can thus easily pre-position new items with no fear of accidents.andP;  Whenyou're satisfied, you can choose to discard the draft page, copy part of itfor later pasting, or merge it with the main document.andP;  It's a brilliant implementation.andM;Text entry is straightforward, with typical styles and alignments available,and Studio/8 lets you freely edit your text as you enter it, includingcutting and pasting from within a text block.andP;  You can mix different fonts,sizes, styles, and colors in the same box.andP;  You can resize and move the boxas well, and still keep it active and editable until you click outside of it.andO;HOME ON THE RANGEandM;Often you need to depict a particular range of colors or perhaps subtleshadings of one hue.andP;  The linear structure of the palette customizerencourages you to organize colors in ranges, mini palettes that you createfrom the Color Mixer or Color Square and bring into the working palette.andP;  Youcan save up to 30 user-defined ranges and import them into other documents.andO;These reside in the program's Preferences file and are available all thetime.andM;Studio/8 can also paint with color gradients, a gradual transition from onecolor or shade to another.andP;  Up to eight separate 32-step gradients may becreated and added to a special palette.andP;  To make a gradient you select itsfirst and last colors, and Studio/8 fills in the intervening ones.andP;  You havethe option to use only existing colors as the intermediates or create a brandnew and very accurate  gradient of in-between colors.andP;  Add a color anywherealong an existing gradient, and Studio/8 reworks the new transition to passthrough  the added tone.andP;  If you want a hard band of unblended color within agradient, you can press the Option key while dragging the band color into thegradient.andP;  You can control the amount of dithering between color steps toproduce distinct bands or smoothly blended transitions.andP;  Your gradients areaccessible from their own palette and may be applied with the Brush, thePaint Bucket, or used as fill for shapes or selections.andP;  Studio/8 is aware ofthe shape you're  filling, and does an excellent job of making the gradientlook natural for that shape.andP;  You can fill ovals and other shapes withoff-center radial fills to simulate glints, or you can suggest directionallighting simply by adjusting the direction and distance of the fill.andP;  PH.D.andO;IN FXandM;A key element of Studio/8's power is its ability to manipulate selections.andO;With its multiplicity of options, Studio/8 is well suited to the productionof special effects.andP;  Selected areas may be inverted, smoothed, lightened,darkened, tinted, and blended.andP;  Selections may be flipped, rotated,distorted, sheared, resized, and bent.andP;  Any document (that's in a readableformat) can be added to the current painting  as a selection.andM;When you wish to protect an area from paint, you can select it with any ofthe selection tools and criteria and define it as a mask.andP;  You can alsoprotect any number of specific colors by picking them from the palette anddubbing them as masked.andP;  In another elegant feature, a mask can be invertedso that it becomes a hole for paint to pass through while the rest of thedocument is shielded.andP;  Masks can even be saved as files, but in this form themasks only remember the shape, not the color(s) of the protected area(s).andP;  Bymasking  certain colors or areas, you can then paint over those objects andhave them appear as though you're painting behind them.andP;  Confused?andP;  Take a peek at Figure 3.andM;When you ask Studio/8 for transparent objects, all it wants to know is howtransparent you want them.andP;  With the Pick Up tools any selection can befloated over your painting, and its degree of transparency can be varied witha scroll bar from opaque to clear.andP;  You can see the effects as you tinkeraround, and you can undo the whole thing, of course.andM;Basically the power is all there.andP;  Studio/8 provides the tools and leaves thedriving to you.andP;  The value of this approach is a degree  of flexibility andcapability that surpasses any given set of canned effects.andP;  But that's not tosay the program lacks magic.andP;  It's just that you participate in the trick.andO;YOU WANT SELECTION?andM;Studio/8 could be accused of giving you too much choice.andP;  As easily as youcan add color layers (through masking) to an object, you can also selectparts to move or remove.andP;  A strong feature here is its well-engineeredinterface for selecting, including, or excluding colors and areas involved inan operation.andP;  There are three  selection tools to do this: Freehand(lasso-like), Rectangle, and Polygon,  each of which can select areas inseveral modes.andP;  You can capture exactly what you've traced out, exclude thebackground color from the selection (like a good ol' lasso), or exclude(``let slip'') any number of specified colors from the selection.andP;  Moreover,these  tools are bidirectional -- they normally contract around an area, butthey can also expand to seek the edges of a particular color region.andM;The Slip mode lets you, with the aid of the lasso tool, either include orexclude objects or parts of objects on the basis of color.andP;  And this can bemore than just one color -- it will include any colors you manually select ordrag across.andP;  You just have to make sure to pass over at least one pixel ofthe color(s) you want to let slip.andP;  These colors can also be manually chosen,added, or subtracted by clicking in any number of cells in the color palette.andO;The system works exceptionally well and especially simplifies selecting amulticolored item from a multicolored background.andM;Sorry, there's more.andP;  You can simultaneously select multiple unconnectedareas and treat them as one selection.andP;  For example, you can use them as asingle brush, refill them, or save them as a separate file.andP;  Mercifully,selections are kept active with just the right amount of tenacity, so thatyou can't easily click somewhere and deselect them.andP;  As a last resort, youcan simply undo a deselection and watch your lassoed prize shimmer again.andO;Studio/8 has the intensely vital capability to turn your last drawn item intoa selection, which lets you move it, resize it, refill it, or whatever, whileleaving the original background intact.andP;  BRUSHING EFFECTIVELYandM;More than simple paint applicators, Studio/8's brushes are also centers forspecial effects.andP;  Tinting, smearing, lightening, darkening, blending, andwatercolor effects are available (tinting is the application of a transparentcolor over existing colors, to modify, not replace what's there).andP;  Modifiedbuilt-in brushes are saved in the program's preference file.andP;  One brushgripe: Depending on the size of the selected brush, a special effect likeBlend or Smooth can react significantly slower than one's natural strokingpace.andP;  It's an area that Electronic Arts should definitely make some effortto improve.andM;A useful brush capability is tracing the edges of a selection.andP;  No matter howgnarly the shape, Studio/8 walks the path -- a task that done by hand wouldoften be an exercise in disappointment.andP;  Custom brushes can be savedseparately.andP;  Brushes may be transformed into standard selections andmanipulated, or even employed as fill patterns.andM;Predictably, Studio/8's Airbrush comes with controllable pattern size andflow, and paints in whatever color or gradient you've chosen.andP;  Withgradients, the color doesn't haphazardly change as you brush.andP;  Instead, youalways spray with the full color range, which matches the transition from thecenter of the pattern outward, producing effects like glowing puffs and fuzzypipes and what have you, depending on the settings and colors.andP;  SHARPENINGYOUR TOOLSandM;Studio/8 gives you fine control over the action of all its painting tools.andO;For example, you can set the brush to paint only over regions that arelighter or darker than the current brush color.andP;  Even the simple pencil canbe configured to restore painted pixels to their original color or to thebackground color.andP;  Some tools, like the Airbrush, are fully customizable andtheir settings can be named, stored, and accessed from the tool palette.andO;General modifiers,  which work with more than one tool, are organized byicons on the palette and also can be invoked with keys from the numerickeypad.andP;  Some are simple on/off toggles.andP;  Others work together to produceuseful variations.andM;In magnified mode, you normally have one small and one large windowon-screen.andP;  The Magnify modifier lets you choose which window shows theenlarged view and which one shows the life-size view.andP;  The ability to changethe size and location of the secondary window is a nice touch.andP;  Surprisingly,however, there's no reduced view in which you can work.andP;  The Print Previewoption shows the whole document, but you can't edit it or reposition theimage area relative to the page; and although there's a Select All command,it actually selects only the exact contents of your window, not the wholedocument.andP;  So you can't, for example, lighten, darken, or fill the wholedocument at once unless you have a large, page-sized screen.andP;  FLYING THEPLANEandM;A menu selection away from the ordinary world is Studio/8's perspectiveplane.andP;  In a dialog box you can establish vanishing points and the angle anddegree of perspective, all by controlling the orientation of a grid.andP;  Youpush buttons for pitch, yaw, roll, and distance, and the animated grid shiftsto show the effects of your viewpoint changes as if you're flying over ahighly planned city.andP;  You can vary the degree of perspective by changing yourdistance from  the plane.andP;  It's fast and intuitive, and fun to play with.andP;  Iteven has a real function.andM;Just as George Carlin explained that a house is simply a place to put yourstuff, the perspective plane is just a place for you to fill with copies ofanything you select.andP;  From the Selection menu, you choose Define Perspective.andO;This gives you a window and tools for torquing and tilting the plane.andP;  Onceyou've defined your perspective, you can go back to your painting window andcreate an image or tile; when you choose Distort from the Selections menu,Studio/8 will distort and copy it onto the perspective plane.andP;  The size ofyour selection determines the size of each copy.andP;  Imagine drawing one tile,selecting it, and having an entire floor laid for you with perfectly joined,repeating copies of your original tile fading into the  sunset (see Figure4).andP;  To further help you with perspective there's an Ellipse tool that letsyou freely rotate a newly drawn ellipse  before gluing it to your canvas, soyou can more easily render angled views of circular surfaces.andP;  ART DEALINGandM;To its credit, Studio/8 doesn't strand your documents in a proprietary fileformat.andP;  It can write PICT2 (its default format) and TIFF files in both thegray-scale and color variations.andP;  In these  two standard formats, Studio/8images are transportable to many other applications.andP;  Studio/8 can directlyopen PICT, PICT2, MacPaint, and both gray-scale and color TIFF documents.andO;Encapsulated PostScript Format (EPSF) images, however, must be importedthrough the Clipboard.andM;The Open File dialog box has a preview feature that instantly displays aminiature of the image.andP;  It's efficient and convenient, but it only workswith PICT files.andP;  INPUT/OUTPUT BUSINESSandM;Color-output devices that accept PICT2 documents, like the Tektronix 4693Dand the Mirus FilmPrinter, render Studio/8 files properly.andP;  In our tests, wesuccessfully imported a Studio/8 file saved as a 72-dots-per-inch (dpi) colorTIFF file into QuarkXPress 2.0, and it printed well.andP;  Saved in gray-scaleTIFF, the file opened in PageMaker and also printed beautifully.andO;Unfortunately, though it can do so many things with color, Studio/8 doesn'tproduce color separations.andP;  For that you'll have to look elsewhere amongstand-alone utilities or import your work into a program that does the job.andM;A more serious restriction in Studio/8 is that the program uses a LaserWriterprinting technique that renders a relatively small number of gray shades,losing much of the subtlety of the on-screen image and convertingeye-pleasing transitions to a few gray bands.andM;And we experienced intermittent problems when printing to a LaserWriter, botha Plus and an NTX: A few evenly spaced white hairlines appeared along theplaces where Studio/8 broke up the image for transmission to the printer.andM;On some LaserWriters it worked fine; on others it didn't.andP;  Using the latestSystem (6.0.2) and its print drivers didn't help.andP;  We were informed that anew, more conventional laser-printing mode is planned and should have beenprovided to Studio/8 owners by the time you  read this.andP;  Additional driversfor color PostScript devices are in the works.andP;  Hard-copy output from anImageWriter is also possible, but the generally poor quality (onlyblack-and-white) is only marginally useful.andM;Two utilities are included with the program.andP;  ColorCam is a screen- capturingprogram that creates PICT2 files.andP;  Gallery is a ``slide- show'' manager thatcan display images in a programmed sequence for on-screen presentations, andoffers a choice of transitions and time intervals.andP;  RAM AND ROOMandM;To house all this magic you'll need a Mac II with a hard disk and a 16- or256-color capability.andP;  Just to install all the Studio/8 files, the manualrecommends a minimum of 6 megabytes of free disk space.andP;  This leaves about 2megabytes free for Studio/8 to write its temporary files.andP;  You won'tnecessarily need all the brushes, backgrounds, and large-font files that comewith Studio/8, but if you're hanging off the outer edges of your hard disk,expect to do some serious housekeeping.andM;Studio/8 also likes to have lots of RAM.andP;  Two megabytes is truly the minimumsystem configuration for full-color work.andP;  Less than 2 megabytes may restrictthe size of your work area, cut the number of documents you can have open, orlimit the scope of some functions.andP;  The manual suggests somememory-management techniques, but the cure is more RAM.andM;You can specify document pixel sizes from 100 x 112 to 1024 x 1024 or``screen size,'' and you can open multiple documents as memory allows.andP;  Ifmemory is short, having an additional open document will reduce the number ofpossible working windows for all documents.andP;  HIGH-RISE STUDIOandM;OK, Studio/8 has lots of tools, great color, and neat effects.andP;  All that hasgot to slow things down, right?andP;  You'd expect it to, but it doesn't.andO;Studio/8 does a fairly rapid job, but that doesn't mean you'll never see thewristwatch.andP;  The calculation-intensive Fill Perspective Plane operation is adefinite cue for a coffee break,  but you can't really blame it -- it's doingseveral days' hard work in just minutes.andM;Studio/8's interface is absolutely first-rate and intuitive in design, allwhich lets you quickly get up to speed.andP;  Virtually every function can beaddressed with keystrokes.andP;  Submenus pop out of the tool box to refine yourchoice of a tool or modifier, and sub- palettes can be torn from the maintool palette and placed anywhere on-screen.andP;  The on-line help is highlypictorial, well-worded and complete to a fault.andP;  Similarly, the hard-bounduser manual is thorough, yet comfortably sized and unintimidating.andM;By itself, or in MultiFinder with other applications, it painted flawlessly.andO;By the most demanding standards, Studio/8 is an excellent program.andP;  Fast,powerful, solid, and smart, it turns a Mac II into  an efficient digitalartist's studio.andP;  All you need are a few lifetimes to explore it all.andP;  CARLOSDOMINGO MARTINEZ IS A MACUSER CONTRIBUTING EDITOR WITH A LIFELONG WEAKNESSFOR PRETTY PICTURES.andP;
