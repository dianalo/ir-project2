Dieter.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>Design measurement is an evolving framework to improve softwarecode quality and coding productivity through the application ofmeasurement to design processes and/or resulting products.andP;  Theframework derives from lessons learned in several measurementprojects, including the University of Maryland (UM) Distos/Incasproject to develop the Lady object-oriented programming language,and compare maintenance needs of programs developed in it to thosedeveloped in a procedural language; development of agoal/question/metric measurement paradigm and its application atthe NASA Software Engineering Laboratory; and the UM Tailoring aMeasurement Environment project.andP;  Results of each project arediscussed.andP;  Design measurement framework guidelines includemodeling the design aspects of interest, considering multipledesign measures, and determining guidelines for reportingmeasurement results.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     New TechniqueMeasurement TechniquesSoftware QualitySoftware MaintenanceApplications ProgrammingCase StudySystem DevelopmentSoftware Design.andO;Feature:   illustrationchart.andO;Caption:   The scope of measurement.
