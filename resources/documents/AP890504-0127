Nicaragua, in turn, will be allowed to replace seven of thediplomats the Reagan administration had expelled in retaliation forthe ouster of the Americans.   The upgrading of the respective embassy staffs does not reflectan improvement in relations between the two countries but rather adesire of both to be better represented in each other's capital,according to U.S. officials.   Last July, the Sandinista government ordered U.S. AmbassadorRichard Melton and seven other envoys out of Nicaragua on chargesthey were fomenting unrest.   Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said all seven slotsbelow the ambassador level will be filled. In addition, four othersin Managua who are being reassigned will be replaced, bringing to11 the number of new American diplomats being sent there.   U.S. officials said the embassy in Managua has been operatingunder considerable strain because the number of diplomats there hasbeen too small for the work load. The area most affected has beenreporting on political and economic affairs, according to theofficials, who asked not to be identified.   Among those expelled by the Reagan administration was AmbassadorCarlos Tunnermann, who was accredited both to the United States andthe Organization of American States.   Nicaragua objected to vigorously to Tunnermann's expulsion,contending it was a violation of standard procedure to expel adiplomat assigned to an international organization.   The Bush administration's policy toward Nicaragua has been topromote a democratic evolution there through political, economicand diplomatic pressures. This represented a marked change from theapproach of President Reagan, who felt military pressure by theContra rebels was the only way to achieve that objective.   Secretary of State James A. Baker III has said that the UnitedStates is prepared to make conciliatory gestures toward theSandinistas if they promote genuine democratic reform between nowand next February, when national elections are scheduled.Otherwise, he has said, the administration will increase economicpressures and take other steps against the Sandinistas.</TEXT></DOC>
