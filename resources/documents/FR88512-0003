L. 100-17, 101 Stat. 256, 258-59) (``the Act''), relatingto the excise tax on the sale of heavy trucks, truck trailers and semitrailers,and tractors. The amendments modify temporary regulations previously promulgatedunder section 512 of the Highway Revenue Act of 1982 (Title V of the SurfaceTransportation Assistance Act). The temporary regulations provided by thisdocument will remain in effect until superseded by final regulations onthis subject.Section 4051(a) of the Code imposes a 12 percent tax on the first retailsale of heavy trucks, truck trailers and semitrailers, and tractors. Section505(a) of the Act amended section 4052(a)(1) to provide that the term ``firstretail sale'' means ``the first sale, for a purpose other than for resaleor leasing in a long-term lease, after manufacture, production, or importation''.Under section 4052(a)(1), the leasing of an article on a long-term basisis treated as the first retail sale, and the tax under section 4051 isimposed on such article at the time the article is leased, rather thanat the time the manufacturer, producer, or importer sells the article tothe lessor. Section 4052(f) provides that the term ``long-term lease''means any lease with a term of 1 year or more. The leasing of an articleon a short-term basis (<T3>i.e.,</T3> less than one year) before the first retail sale of sucharticle is treated as a taxable use under section 4052(a)(3), and the taxunder section 4051 is imposed at the time of that lease.The tax imposed on either a long-term or short-term lease is computed ona price established by the Commissioner that is based on the retail salesprice of similar articles (a constructive sales price). See discussionof ``Presumptive retail sales price'' below.<ITAG tagnum="84">Definition of First Retail Sale</ITAG>Temporary regulations andSection; 145.4052-1, relating to the excise taxon heavy trucks, truck trailers and semitrailers, and tractors, were revisedby temporary regulations published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on September 13, 1985 (T.D. 8050) (50 FR 37350).Those revised regulations provided that a sale by a manufacturer, producer,or importer is treated as the first retail sale unless either (a) the purchaseris not in the business of leasing and intends to resell the article, or(b) the seller and the purchaser are registered under section 4222 (prescribingrules relating to the registration required to make tax-free sales), andthe seller receives a certificate indicating the purchaser's intent toresell the articles.Section 4052, as amended by the Act, treats a long-term lease as a firstretail sale. Sections 145.4052-1 (a)(1), (a)(2), and (a)(3) of these temporaryregulations set forth certification requirements that determine when thefirst retail sale of an article occurs.<ITAG tagnum="84">Certification Requirements</ITAG>Section 145.4052-1(a)(2) of these temporary regulations provides that thesale of an article will be taxable as the first retail sale unless (a)the sale is a tax-free sale under section 4221, (b) the purchaser and sellerare registered under andSection; 48.4222(a)-1 and the seller in good faithaccepts a proper certification from the purchaser that the purchaser intendseither to lease the article on a long-term basis or to resell the article,or (c) there has been a prior taxable sale of the article. ``Taxable sale''for these purposes includes a long-term lease or a taxable use, such asa short-term lease. If the purchaser does not meet one of the exceptionsin andSection; 1.4052-1(a)(2), the seller will be liable for the tax imposedon the sale.Thus, andSection;145.4052-1(a)(2) allows a purchaser who intends either tolease on a long-term basis or to resell an article to purchase such articletax-free. In such cases the tax under section 4051 will be imposed on asubsequent taxable sale or use of the article.Paragraphs (a)(4) and (d)(3)(ii) of andSection;145.4052-1 set forth specialrules regarding imposition of the tax. Section 145.4052-1(a)(4) providesthat in certain circumstances tax will be imposed on the resale or long-termlease of a tax-paid trailer or semitrailer and the seller of such traileror semitrailer shall be liable for such tax. Under andSection;145.4052-1(a)(4)the seller may in such cases reduce the tax liability by the amount oftax previously paid with respect to the article.Section 145.4052-1(d)(3)(ii) provides that the tax under section 4051 shallbe computed on a price that includes a presumed markup when a person otherthan a manufacturer, producer, or importer is designated as the sellerof an article but (a) such person does not perform significant activitiesrelating to the processing of the sale of the article and (b) the principalpurpose of processing the sale through such person is to avoid or evadethe presumed markup imposed under section 4052(b)(4)(A)(ii).<ITAG tagnum="84">Presumptive Retail Sales Price</ITAG>In order to achieve comparable tax treatment among long-term leases, salesby manufacturers, producers, or importers, and retail sales by other persons,sections 505(b) and 506(a) of the Act amended section 4052(b) by addingnew paragraphs (b) (3) and (4). These paragraphs were added to ensure thatthe tax base of most transactions considered to be taxable sales subjectto section 4051 includes either an actual or a presumptive retail markup.As a result, sections 4052(b) (3) and (4) provide that the tax imposedby section 4051 shall, under certain circumstances, be computed on a presumptiveretail sales price (<T3>i.e.,</T3> a tax base that includes a presumed markup).Section 4052(b)(3) provides that the tax imposed on any long-term leasethat is treated as the first retail sale of an article shall be computedon a tax base that includes the price at which the article was sold tothe lessor, the cost of any parts and accessories installed by the lessor,and an amount equal to a presumed markup. Section 145.4052-1(c)(5) of theregulations is amended to provide that the tax imposed on a short-termlease by a person other than a manufacturer, producer or importer shallalso be computed on a tax base that includes the price at which the articlewas sold to the lessor, the cost of any parts and accessories installedby the lessor, and an amount equal to the presumed markup. However, theleasing of an article by a person other than a manufacturer, producer,or importer will not be subject to tax under section 4051 if such articlewas previously subject to tax under that section.Similarly, section 4052(b)(4) provides that the tax imposed on a sale bya manufacturer, producer, or importer shall be computed on a tax base thatincludes an actual or constructive sales price of the article and an amountequal to a presumed markup.For purposes of these temporary regulations, a single presumed markup percentageof four percent has been established for most articles subject to section4051. However, truck trailers, semitrailers, and remanufactured trucksand tractors are subject to a zero percent markup. The imposition of apresumed markup percentage greater than zero percent on these articlesis not necessary to carry out the purpose of the section 4051 retail taxbecause retail sales of trailers and semitrailers are generally made bytrailer manufacturers. Similarly, remanufactured trucks and tractors generallyare not sold through an established retail distribution network.The presumed markup percentage is defined under section 4052(b)(3)(B) as``the average markup percentage of retailers of articles of the type involved.''The Internal Revenue Service is currently examining whether it is appropriateto exercise its regulatory authority to establish additional markup percentagesfor different categories of articles. A tax system involving differentmarkups raises a variety of problems relating to administration and enforcement.Therefore, the Service is requesting comments and suggestions relatingto this particular issue in order to administer this tax fairly and efficiently.<ITAG tagnum="84">Special Analyses</ITAG>No general notice of proposed rulemaking is required by 5 U.S.C. 553(b)for temporary regulations. Accordingly, the Regulatory Flexibility Act(5 U.S.C. Chapter 6) does not apply, and no regulatory flexibility analysisis required for this rule. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue has determinedthat this rule is not a major rule as defined in Executive Order 12291and that a regulatory impact analysis is therefore not required.<ITAG tagnum="84">Drafting Information</ITAG>The principal author of these regulations is Maurice B. Foley of the Legislationand Regulations Division of the Office of Chief Counsel, Internal RevenueService. However, personnel from other offices of the Internal RevenueService and Treasury Department participated in developing the regulationson matters of both substance and style.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 26 CFR Part 145</ITAG>Extended due date for payment of certain fuel taxes, Floor stocks refunds,Floor stocks tax, Highway Revenue Act of 1982.Adoption of Amendments to the RegulationsAccordingly, 26 CFR Part 145 is amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 145_TEMPORARY EXCISE TAX REGULATIONS UNDER THE HIGHWAY REVENUEACT OF 1987 (PUB.

Theadditional $2,000 includes the dealer's mark-up, costs of transportingthe truck from M to D, and overhead. No parts or accessories were addedto the truck. P did not give D a certificate and did not have an agreementwith D under which all vehicles purchased were to be resold.

D does not have records substantiatingthat the truck was sold for a price that included a markup equal to orgreater than the presumed markup percentage. The tax on the sale of thetruck to P is determined under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section.

The tax on suchsubsequent sale will be based on a price determined under paragraph (d)of this section. For example, if an article was sold to a purchaser whointended to lease such article long-term, the sale would not have beentaxable under the prior regulations even though the seller did not receivea certificate of the purchaser's intent to lease the vehicle. If such asale was treated as nontaxable by the parties, and the purchaser leasesit long-term on or after October 1, 1987, the lease will be treated asa taxable sale of the article. The tax is to be computed under paragraph(b)(3)(ii) of this section and the price will be computed under paragraph(d)(5).

The tax on asale or lease after September 30, 1987, will be based on a price determinedunder paragraph (d) of this section. For example, if a vehicle was soldon January 3, 1987, to a purchaser who intended to resell the article andwho was not in the business of leasing to any extent, the sale would nothave been taxable under the interim regulations even though the sellerdid not receive a certificate indicating the purchaser's intent to resellthe article. If such a sale was not treated as a taxable sale by the parties,and the purchaser resells the article, the resale will be treated as ataxable sale of the article under paragraph (a)(2) of this section. (ii) <T3>Sales treated as first retail sale by purchaser and seller. </T3>Ifthe sale of an article after November 11, 1985, and before October 1, 1987,was treated as a taxable sale by the parties and tax was paid with respectto the article under the interim regulations, the subsequent sale of thearticle by the purchaser will not be treated as a taxable sale under paragraph(a)(2) of this section. <ITAG tagnum="6">Lawrence B.
