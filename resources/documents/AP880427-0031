The proposal was made Tuesday. If it is adopted, it will be thefirst such accord with outside oil producers in OPEC's 28-yearhistory.   On the New York Mercantile Echange on Tuesday, contracts forJune delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude,closed 20 cents higher at $18.60 per barrel, partly in reaction toreports of the proposal.   Mexico's oil minister, Fernando Hiriart, said he conveyed theoffer to representatives of the 13-member Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries on behalf of Mexico and six other independentoil producers _ Egypt, China, Colombia, Malaysia, Oman and Angola.   Speaking through an interpreter, Hiriart told reporters thesuggested cutbacks would be for May and June only. He added thatthe basis for calculating the reductions would be the average oilexport level of each country over the past six months.   Hiriart said his government ``shares OPEC's objective'' ofdriving prices back up to the cartel's official target of $18 perbarrel. Most OPEC oil currently is selling for $14 to $15 a barrel.   Rilwanu Lukman of Nigeria, the president of OPEC, called theoffer ``a good beginning.''   The independent producers presented their offer at a meetingwith six OPEC members. The two groups were scheduled to meet againthis afternoon for a final day of closed-door deliberations.   Venezuela's oil minister, Arturo Hernandez Grisanti, toldreporters the six OPEC officials were not authorized to make anydecisions on the non-OPEC offer. He said details of the proposalwould be passed on to all OPEC countries at a meeting in Vienna onThursday.   Hiriart declined to say what Mexico or the other independentproducers would do if OPEC did not agree to the offer.   ``We are ready to implement these measures when we find theadequate proportional response from OPEC,'' Hiriart said, addingthat this meant a ``volume cut equivalent to 5 percent of itsexports.''   He said a 5 percent cut by the non-OPEC group would amount toabout 200,000 barrels a day. He added it was unclear exactly whatthe 5 percent reduction for OPEC would amount to in barrels per day.   OPEC exports about 14 million barrels of its collective oilproduction of between 17.5 million and 18 million barrels a day. A5 percent cut would appear to mean an export reduction of 700,000barrels daily.   OPEC itself is sharply divided about whether to reduce itsproduction, although it has long welcomed collaborative efforts byindependent oil producers.   One of the main obstacles to an OPEC agreement on reducing itsoil output is Iraq's refusal to cooperate. Iraq is not party to anexisting OPEC production-limiting agreement because its demand fora production quota equal to that of Iran was denied. The twonations have been at war since 1980.   Iraq is believed to be pumping at least 2.5 million barrelsdaily, more than any other OPEC member except Saudi Arabia. Iranproduces roughly 2 million barrels daily.   A further complication for OPEC is Saudi Arabia's decisionTuesday to break diplomatic relations with Iran. Although this wasnot expected to stop the oil ministers of both countries fromsitting together at the OPEC negotiating table, it could cast ashadow over efforts to agree on cartel policy moves.   Regardless of the outcome of OPEC's talks with the independentproducers, members of both groups said the meetings were importantfor the long-term development of the world oil market.   ``It is the beginning of a new stage of cooperation between alarge number of oil-producing countries,'' Hiriart said. ``It ishoped that other countries will join in the effort.''</TEXT></DOC>
