The request for amendment wassubmitted by letter dated December 23, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The other licensees are the Salt River Project AgriculturalImprovement and Power District, El Paso Electric Company, Southern CaliforniaEdison Company, Public Service Company of New Mexico, Los Angeles Departmentof Water and Power, and Southern California Public Power Authority.The proposed amendment would revise Technical Specification SurveillanceRequirement 4.1.3.1.2 to allow continued operation of Unit 1 until theend of the current cycle (approximately three months), without conductingany further exercise tests of Control Element Assembly (CEA) 64. The proposedchange will eliminate a potentially challenging operating condition. Theplant may be unnecessarily challenged during performance of testing onCEA No. 64 because this CEA has slipped during previous rod motion testingdue to an intermittent ground on the CEA's lower gripper coil.Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission willhave made findings required by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended(the Act) and the Commission's regulations.The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment requestinvolves no significant hazards considerations. Under the Commission'sregulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facilityin accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significantincrease in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated;or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reductionin a margin of safety.A discussion of these standards as they relate to this amendment follows:<ITAG tagnum="84">Criterion 1</ITAG>The proposed change would not increase the probability or consequencesof any accident previously evaluated since the proposed change is stillwithin the bounds of the current safety analyses. The proposed change isintended to reduce the probability of a reactor transient due to a droppedrod. The licensees have provided the following discussion:<ITAG tagnum="21">The basis for Surveillance Requirement 4.1.3.1.2 is to demonstratethat all applicable CEAs are capable of being inserted into the core whenrequired. All performances of this test to date conclusively show thatCEA andplusmin;64 can be inserted into the core. Additionally, Unit 1 hasexperienced six reactor trip events during the current cycle of operation.During each reactor trip, CEA andplusmin;64 fell into the core as required.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">It is unlikely that an obstruction would develop between now and theend of the current cycle that would render CEA andplusmin;64 untrippable.However, even if CEA andplusmin;64 would not drop into the core when required,this condition is within the bounds of the safety analyses. All analysesin which shutdown CEA reactivity is critical require that the most reactiveCEA be assumed to remain stuck outside the core * * *. In addition, shutdownmargin * * * would not be adversely affected by this change because itis determined by considering a single malfunction resulting in the highestworth CEA failing to insert.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Criterion 2</ITAG>The proposed change would not create the possibility of a new or differentkind of accident from any previously analyzed since it would not introducenew systems, modes of operation, failure modes or other plant perturbations.The lower gripper coil for CEA-64 would only be energized during CEA inwardor outward motion. The coil is not energized when the reactor is trippednor during steady state operation. Therefore, the requested Technical Specificationchange will not create the possibility of an accident or malfunction ofa different type than those already evaluated in the FSAR.<ITAG tagnum="84">Criterion 3</ITAG>The proposed change would not involve a significant reduction in the marginof safety. The license stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">The requested change for CEA andplusmin;64 will not reduce the marginof safety as defined in the basis for the Technical Specifications. Allperformances of the CEA exercise testing to date have conclusively shownthat CEA andplusmin;64 can be inserted into the core. CEA andplusmin;64 hassuccessfully fallen into the core as required during 6 reactor trip eventsduring the current cycle of operation. Additionally, the safety analysesalready address the condition where the single most reactive CEA failsto drop into the core during design basis events.</ITAG>Accordingly, the Commission proposes to determine that this change doesnot involve significant hazards considerations.The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination.Any comments received within 15 days after the date of publication of thisnotice will be considered in making any final determination. The Commissionwill not normally make a final determination unless it receives a requestfor a hearing.Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Regulatory PublicationsBranch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Officeof Administration and Resources Management, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, and should cite the publication date and page numberof the <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice.Written comments may also be delivered to Room P-216, Phillips Building,7920 Norfolk Avenue, Bethesda, Maryland from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Copiesof written comments received may be examined at the NRC Public DocumentRoom, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC. The filingof requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussedbelow.By January 18, 1989, the licensees may file a request for a hearing withrespect to issuance of the amendment to the subject facility operatinglicense and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceedingand who wishes to participate as a part in the proceeding must file a writtenrequest for hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests fora hearing and petitions for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordancewith the Commission's ``Rule of Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings''in 10 CFR Part 2. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to interveneis filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and LicensingBoard, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safetyand Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; andthe Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board willissue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order.As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall setforth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceeding,and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding.The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention shouldbe permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) Thenature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to theproceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial,or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of anyorder which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest.The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subjectmatter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Anyperson who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has beenadmitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave ofthe Board up to fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfythe specificity requirements described above.Not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file a supplement to thepetition to intervene, which must include a list of the contentions thatare sought to be litigated in the matter, and the bases for each contentionset fort with reasonable specificity. Contentions shall be limited to matterswithin the scope of the amendment under consideration. A petitioner whofails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirements withrespect to at least one contention will not be permitted to participateas a party.Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subjectto any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene, and have theopportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, includingthe opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.If the amendment is issued before the expiration of 30-days, the Commissionwill make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazardsconsiderations. If a hearing is requested, the final determination willserve to decide when the hearing is held.If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significanthazards considerations, the Commission may issue the amendment and makeit effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing heldwould take place after issuance of the amendment.If the final determination is that the amendment request involves significanthazards considerations, any hearing held would take place before the issuanceof any amendment.Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expirationof the 15-day notice period. However, should circumstances change duringthe notice period, such that failure to act in a timely way would result,for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission mayissue the license amendment before the expiration of the 15-day noticeperiod, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involvesno significant hazards considerations. The final determination will considerall public and State comments received. Should the Commission take thisaction, it will publish a notice of issuance. The Commission expects thatthe need to take this action will occur very infrequently.A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filedwith the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Service Branch, or may bedelivered to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building,2120 L Street, NW, Washington, DC, by the above date. Where petitions arefiled during the last ten (10) days of the notice period, it is requestedthat the petitioner promptly so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephonecall to Western Union at 1-(800) 325-6000 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700).The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number3737 and the following message addressed to George W. Knighton: petitioner'snumber and telephone number; date petition was mailed; plant name; andpublication date and page number of this <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice. A copy of the petition should also besent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, and to: Arthur C. Gehr, Esq., Snell andamp; Wilmer,3100 Valley Center, Phoenix, Arizona 85007, Attorney for the licensees.Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions,supplemental petitions and/or requests for hearing will not be entertainedabsent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or thepresiding Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or requestshould be granted based upon a balancing of the factors specified in 10CFR 2.714(a)(1) (i)-(v) and 2.714(d).For further details with respect to this action, see the application foramendment dated December 23, 1988, which is available for public inspectionat the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,DC 20555, and at the Local Public Document Room, Phoenix Public Library,Business and Science Division, 12 East McDowell Road, Phoenix, Arizona85004.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 23rd day of December 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">George W.
