TheFrench statesman Talleyrand's legendary advice to youngdiplomats was, &quot;Above all, not too much zeal.&quot; In his classicprimer, &quot;Diplomacy,&quot; Sir Harold Nicolson cautions the idealdiplomat against &quot;vanity {because it prefers} a brilliant butundesirable triumph to some unostentatious but more prudentcompromise.&quot;   Richard Haass fears that this lesson has been forgottenparticularly by American diplomats who live in a&quot;getting-to-yes&quot; culture that believes every problem has asolution. In his short study, &quot;Conflicts Unending: The UnitedStates and Regional Disputes&quot; (Yale University Press, 172pages, $22.50), he argues that many international conflictscan only be managed, not eliminated, and that imaginativediplomacy can be futile, even dangerous. &quot;Iatrogenic, ortreatment induced, illness has analogies outside the world ofmedicine.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   This advice sounds suspiciously like a rationalization forGeorge Bush's foreign policy. Not suprisingly, Mr. Haass, whotaught at Harvard until 1989, is now the president's top aideon the Middle East and South Asia. In this book, he proposesadding the notion of &quot;ripeness&quot; to the language of diplomacy.Ripeness is &quot;the existence of the prerequisites fordiplomatic progress.&quot; If the U.S. pushes for far-reaching&quot;solutions&quot; in the absence of these prerequisites, not onlyis failure likely, but the U.S. will dash raisedexpectations, lose credibility and generally heightentensions.   For example, he believes that Alexander Haig's franticshuttle diplomacy at the start of the Falkland Islands crisismay have backfired by convincing the Argentine generals thatAmerica's equivocations would dissuade Britain from going towar. When that didn't happen, the generals felt betrayed byMr. Haig. The British, meanwhile, were annoyed by Mr. Haig'swaffling. The author suggests that if the U.S. had backedBritain firmly from the start of the crisis, the Argentinesmight have been deterred from war.   If a situation is ripe, on the other hand, negotiationscan help. Mr. Haass argues that the Camp David peace accordsbetween Israel and Egypt resulted at least as much from aripe situation as from brilliant (American) negotiations.Egypt had gained enough prestige from the Yom Kippur War toallow it to negotiate from strength, and Menachem Begin wasthe only Israeli leader who could give back the Sinai withoutbeing accused of weakening the country. Similarly, theaccords on Rhodesia, the Beagle Channel dispute, and theIran-Iraq War were all possible only because of theirbackground circumstances.   What exactly is ripeness? First, writes Mr. Haass, the twoopposing parties must want an agreement. Second both partiesmust be able to carry through (with domestic support) ontheir promises. Third, there must be a face-saving rationalefor both parties to claim that they made a good deal. Andlast, there must be a negotiating process that both partiesaccept.   This definition, however, veers toward tautology.Ripeness, as presented by Mr. Haass, allows negotiations toprosper. But ripeness is also defined as the situation whenboth parties want to negotiate, are able to negotiate, andagree on how to negotiate. Surely it is hardly surprisingthat negotiations prosper in these conditions]   The trick, then, is to know when ripeness exists, not inhindsight but at the moment. Mr. Haass's discussion of SouthAfrica illustrates this problem. He makes a perfectlyplausible case that the country is &quot;far from ripe {becausewhite South Africans} have yet to conclude that the costs ofsustaining apartheid are unbearable.&quot; But if President F.W.de Klerk's reforms, proposed after this book was published,are implemented, we would have to say, in retrospect, thatsuddenly in 1990, white South Africans concluded thatapartheid was unbearable, thus ripening the situation.   Mr. Haass spends most of the book expertly summarizingfive regional disputes in the Middle East; Cyprus; India andPakistan; South Africa; and Northern Ireland. In each case,he argues that the conditions for ripeness are far frompresent and that the U.S. shouldn't put forward peace plansbecause they won't work. Instead, he suggests that Washingtonstrive for such modest but attainable goals as maintainingcredibility with the major parties in the dispute andpreventing accidents and miscalculations. According to hisscenario, an elaborate peace plan for the Middle East wouldonly backfire, making war even more likely. Mr. Haass failsto identify situations that are ripe or to suggest anyimaginative alternative.   It is ironic that a book preaching against overambitionshould have a needlessly complicated theoreticalarchitecture. &quot;Ripeness&quot; is simply a fancy way of saying,&quot;the time must be right for negotiations.&quot; How does one tellwhen the time is right? Well, that's what diplomats are for.They study a situation and make a judgment. No magic formulacan replace political analysis. In fact, Mr. Haass is verygood at this kind of analysis. What he does do in thisalternately irritating and interesting book is to describethe conflicts with admirable level-headedness andrefreshingly clear prose. And one cannot argue with hiscentral message -- that American diplomats should spend lesstime thinking up clever compromise formulas and more timemoving the opposing parties toward general agreement.Otherwise, Winston Churchill to the contrary, &quot;jaw-jaw&quot; canlead to &quot;war-war.&quot;   ---   Mr. Zakaria is a fellow at Harvard University's Center forScience and International Affairs.</TEXT></DOC>
