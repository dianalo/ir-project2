(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   PTL founder Jim Bakker said under oaththat thousands of internal ministry documents and letters have beenaltered, buried or destroyed since he resigned in March 1987.   Bakker, who PTL records say received nearly $8.3 million insalary, bonuses and perks in 1983-87, also said he was underpaid.   Bakker made the comments in a sworn deposition as he prepared todefend himself against a $52 million lawsuit by PTL, which chargeshe grossly mismanaged the TV ministry.   ``I have reason to dispute all records of PTL at this time ...because of hostile people who took over Heritage USA,'' Bakker saidin a July 18 deposition, sworn answers to attorneys' questions. Healso was deposed on July 22.   The Charlotte Observer said in a story in Wednesday's editionsit obtained the depositions, which have not been filed court.   The PTL lawsuit alleges that Bakker and former aide DavidTaggart took millions of dollars from PTL for their personal use,although they knew the ministry was in financial trouble. Bakkerresigned following revelations of his tryst with former churchsecretary Jessica Hahn.   The ministry has been reorganizing under Chapter 11 bankruptcyproceedings since June 1987 and must sell the Heritage USA themepark and its other assets to pay debts. Bankruptcy trustee M.C.``Red'' Benton has said he expects to recommend a buyer this month.   The suit is scheduled for trial Sept. 12 in U.S. BankruptcyCourt in Columbia.   In his deposition, Bakker stated:   _ ``People ... have come to my office to tell me that they havelied under oath to destroy me.''   _ ``Corporate records were destroyed wholesaley (sic).''   _ ``Also, tens of thousands of letters personally addressed tome ... are buried on these grounds.''   Bakker said the destruction of documents and letters was orderedby subordinates of the Rev. Jerry Falwell, who became PTL'schairman in March 1987, after Bakker resigned in a sex and moneyscandal. Falwell served until October 1987.   Falwell spokesman Mark DeMoss denied Bakker's allegations.   ``It would not have been in our best interest to destroy anydocuments,'' DeMoss said. ``We couldn't get our hands on documentsfast enough, that we were trying to preserve, because so much ofthe documents and records there are not the kinds of things, Ithink, Jim Bakker would want preserved. ... A lot of them werepretty incriminating.''   Bakker attorney Jim Toms told PTL lawyers that he will seek acourt order to excavate the site where Bakker claims many documentsare buried.</TEXT></DOC>
