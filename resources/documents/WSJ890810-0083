Some analysts suggested prices may already have bottomed, at least for the short term, with West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark crude, settling in a range of $17.50 to $18.50 a barrel and Middle East crudes holding around $15.    In U.S. futures trading yesterday, West Texas Intermediate for September delivery closed at $18.21 a barrel, up nine cents. Crude contracts for later months closed 12 cents to 15 cents a barrel higher on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Outside the U.S., spot prices of North Sea and Middle East crudes generally were five cents to 15 cents higher for the second day.    Still, these levels of prices generally are down $2 a barrel since the third week of July. The declines have been blamed on continued high output by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and on some signs that third-quarter petroleum demand may be more sluggish than expected.    There is concern among some that these factors, particularly the high OPEC output, could trigger further erosion in oil prices over the weeks ahead. &quot;I think we will see a little more softening,&quot; said Neil Chandi, president of Crescent International Petroleum Ltd. &quot;There is a glut of crude around,&quot; he said.    So far, however, there is little evidence that the summer surge in OPEC output will result in a replay of last year's oil-market developments that caused the price of West Texas Intermediate to fall below $13 a barrel. By most accounts, OPEC production is holding at around 21.5 million barrels a day.    That is around one million barrels a day more than had been expected for thirdquarter OPEC output. But analysts note it hasn't yet meant a big buildup in the world's oil inventories. &quot;Inventories are still fairly balanced,&quot; said Edward N. Krapels, president of Energy Security Analysis Inc., a Washingtonbased firm that monitors oil supplies world-wide.    Crude oil stocks have increased recently. Mr. Krapels's latest Euroil-stock report shows a buildup of nine million barrels in Europe's crude oil inventories. According to the American Petroleum Institute, U.S. crude oil stocks rose 3.4 million barrels last week to a total of 333.5 million.    But these aren't burdensome levels. U.S. crude inventories are well below the nearly 348 million barrels of a year ago. Robert Boslego, a Winchester, Mass., consultant who analyzes U.S. oil statistics for clients, said there's a possible &quot;price recovery in the short-term based on the fact that crude inventories have fallen to relatively low levels.&quot;    In other U.S. commodity markets yesterday:    GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Corn-futures prices dipped as traders took to the sidelines in anticipation of the Agriculture Department's first official estimate of the fall harvests, which is slated for release after the close of trading today. Some traders expect the government to project a corn harvest 53% larger than last year's drought-stunted crop. Prices were also depressed by slow corn-export business, said Susan Leighty, an analyst at PrudentialBache Securities Inc., New York. Wheat and soybean futures prices rose.    COPPER: Futures prices advanced modestly in light trading. The September contract rose 0.60 cent a pound to $1.107. One trader, Richard Hirsch of Sharps Pixley, New York metals brokers, observed that it was a &quot;dog-days August market&quot; for the most part. &quot;After a 15-cents-a-pound rally from early July, the market is now consolidating by holding steady,&quot; Mr. Hirsch said. &quot;When it's considered that this is the month when plants close, more in Europe than in the U.S., and interest in copper is seasonally at a low ebb, it is surprising that the September position, which has found support at the $1.10 level, is behaving as well as it is,&quot; he said. An analyst said most of the focus by traders was on the strike at Highland Valley, British Columbia. The mediator and the company and union are expected to resume talks today. Earlier this week there were expectations that a solution might be reached this week, but the late start of the talks might delay that. A contributing factor to New York's steadiness was an advance in London, which was stimulated by reports of some Chinese buying of copper, the analyst said. The Chinese buying has been long awaited, and while it isn't aggressive, it is injecting a supporting tone, he said.    SUGAR: Futures prices rose. The October contract ended with a gain of 0.26 cent a pound at 14.07 cents. After several days of drifting lower, some support was uncovered at around the 13.75-cents level, said Judith Ganes, analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton, New York. Talk that India might buy 200,000 to 250,000 tons of physical sugar to make up for a domestic production shortfall helped boost futures prices, analysts said. Ms. Ganes observed that over the long term, the fundamentals remain bullish. Supplies are tight, she said, and any sign of significant physical-market purchases could spur a price rally. She said over the near term, however, nervousness is being created by a lack of demand for physical sugar and the fact that there has been some aggressive selling of futures by sugar-trade concerns. But another analyst said that while the unconfirmed reports of India being a possible buyer helped the market, &quot;if they had indeed bought, there would have been a much stronger rally.&quot; It was basically a market without any fundamental developments, he said. </TEXT></DOC>
