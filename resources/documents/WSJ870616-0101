An official of Cargill Investor Services Ltd., a unit of closely held Minneapolis-based Cargill, said the sanctions wouldn't be appealed but refused to disclose the amount of the fine.    Cargill, one of the world's biggest commodity-trading groups, operates seven seats on Liffe and is one of the exchange's most active members.    Dick Driver, managing director of the London-based unit, said Liffe imposed the disciplinary measures for breaches of exchange trading rules by former CIS employees.    The violations &quot;involved pre-arranged trades,&quot; Mr. Driver said. Under the Liffe's &quot;open outcry system,&quot; common at most major futures exchanges, traders are required to shout transactions in a specified ring to complete them.    However, Mr. Driver said, &quot;there never has been a hint that any clients were damaged or disadvantaged in the marketplace&quot; because of the violations.    In January Liffe began to investigate alleged violations of its open outcry system, and last week the exchange fined three traders #1,000 ($1,653) apiece and suspended each one for seven days for breaches of its rules.    The exchange last week also reprimanded another member firm, Fulton Prebon Futures Ltd. </TEXT></DOC>
