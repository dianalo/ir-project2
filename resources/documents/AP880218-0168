Meanwhile, Republican party regulars in Nevada were bracing forPat Robertson's ``invisible army'' as they geared up for anon-binding straw poll tonight. And Democrats were set forback-to-back debates, starting tonight in Texas, the biggest SuperTuesday state.   Babbitt and du Pont became the first post-New Hampshirecasualties.   ``Today our campaign lowers its flag, but our crusade continuesto march,'' du Pont said in his hometown of Wilmington, Del.   ``In America we do not promise that everyone wins, only thateveryone has the opportunity to try. You have given me theopportunity. ... You listened, considered and chose. I could nothave asked for more,'' said du Pont, heir to the chemical-companyfortune.   Both du Pont, former governor of Delaware, and Babbitt, formergovernor of Arizona, said they would not endorse another candidatefor now.   Appearing at a news conference in Washington, Babbitt said hewas reminded of the biblical saying, ``The truth shall set youfree.'' In his case, he said, the truth _ his poor showings in Iowaand New Hampshire _ ``came a lot sooner than I expected.''   Still, he said, ``Today I am free.''   ``Although I am withdrawing from this race, I am not withdrawingfrom the cause that brought me to it,'' he said. ``I don't know whywe fared no better; I'll leave that for others to ponder. But I amvery proud of what we did achieve and I am honored beyond measureby the opportunity I was granted to take part in this campaign.''   Babbitt, who formally announced his candidacy on March 10, 1987,failed to set the electorate afire with his call for a nationalsales tax to combat the federal deficit, but received good pressreviews for his candor and wry humor.   He said today a friend had told him, ``Bruce, you fought a goodfight. You were in it right up to the beginning.''   Gary Hart, who finished last among Democrats in New Hampshire,headed home to Denver, where he said his campaign would continuebut not for reasons of ``ego and ambition.''   Financially strapped Paul Simon, who placed second in Iowa andthird in New Hampshire, backed off his declaration that he must wincontests next week in South Dakota or Minnesota to stay in the racefor the Democratic presidential nomination.   He told reporters at a series of fundraisers late Wednesday,``We're now hedging on that because of the reaction we've beengetting from around the country.''   Du Pont entered the Republican race on Sept. 16, 1986, and,along with Rep. Jack Kemp of New York, sought to present himself asthe conservative alternative to front-runners Bob Dole and GeorgeBush.   Bush, who was campaigning in Missouri today, brushed asidecomplaints from Dole that he had misrepresented the Kansassenator's positions on taxes, an oil-import fee and arms control ina flood of commercials just before Tuesday's New Hampshire primary.   ``I'm not going to dwell on it,'' the vice president said. ``Idon't want to be drawn into something like that. Keep it on a highplane.''   Dole, who beat Bush in Iowa and had hoped to deliver theknockout punch in New Hampshire, promised to hit back if attackedagain. Which he was _ by Rep. Jack Kemp, campaigning in Minnesota,who hit Dole's record on taxes and Social Security.   The Democrats' New Hampshire victor, Michael Dukakis, hotfootedit South and took quick aim at Tennessean Albert Gore, who hashinged his campaign on a strong showing on March 8, when all theSouthern states but one hold primaries or caucuses.   ``There's a mythology about the South as if it's some kind offoreign country. It's nonsense,'' said Dukakis, who picked upendorsements Wednesday from former Kentucky Gov. Martha LayneCollins and former New Orleans Mayor Dutch Morial.   Told that Gore had said his opponents were alienated from thevoters, the Massachusetts governor retorted: ``Mr. Gore left Iowa,virtually left New Hampshire. ... I don't know who's alienated.''   Rep. Richard Gephardt, who finished second in New Hampshire, wascampaigning in South Dakota, which holds a ``beauty contest''primary on Tuesday in which voters state a preference that does notcommit convention delegates.   Gephardt strategists said he wanted to head into Super Tuesdaywith a recent win under his belt. The Missouri congressman also wascampaigning in Wyoming, which holds caucuses March 5 with 13delegates at stake.   Jesse Jackson, who made respectable showings in Iowa and NewHampshire, was back in the South on a swing through Florida, Texasand Alabama. In Mobile, he stood with paper workers locked out in acontract dispute, sounding his campaign call for economic justice.   The Democrats were gathering in Dallas for the first of twodebates. On Friday they move on to St. Paul, Minn.   Robertson, in Florida, threatened to reignite the controversy hekicked off at a GOP debate Sunday when he asserted that there areSoviet missiles in Cuba _ a claim the White House quickly denied.   ``In my opinion they are there,'' the former televisionevangelist said as he campaigned in Lake Buena Vista on Wednesday.   Robertson had acknowledged after first making the claim that hehad no direct evidence to back it up.   In Nevada, where Republicans were holding a straw poll tonight,GOP state chairwoman Sally Vitkus-McKinney said she had heardreports that backers of Robertson would try to pack the caucuses.Followers of the former television evangelist have flummoxed GOPregulars in several states with massive organizing drives.   Steve Wark, Nevada coordinator for Robertson, said hisorganizing efforts were no different than those of coordinators forother candidates.</TEXT></DOC>
