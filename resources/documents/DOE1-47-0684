Experimentsare performed using Nd-laser delivering 20J in 350ps, 1.06{mu}m pulse.After frequency quadrupling through two KDP crystals, the 0.27{mu}m-laserenergy is typically 7J. Targets are 1mm-wide Al planer foils. Thicknessranges from 5 to 15{mu}m. In order to study the effect of nonuniformirradiation on the target acceleration, irradiance modulations are introducedwithout energy loss by inserting a pair of quartz plates in the incidentbeam behind the focusing lens. Modulation of rear surface velocity oftargets (--solid density of Al) are measured by x-ray backlighting andcompared with ablation-pressure modulation derived from focus intensitymodulation using the experimental result of P{alpha}proportional to I/sup0.6/. Nonuniformity smoothing of the accelerated target measured is inreasonable agreement with the improved cloudy-day model in the powerregion of 5 x 10/sup 13/ to 2 x 10/sup 14/Wcm/sup -2/ and the modulationwavelength range of 25 to 70{mu}m.</TEXT></DOC>
