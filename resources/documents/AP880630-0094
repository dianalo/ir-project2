Colin Breeze, 33, was held without bond Wednesday at theMetropolitan Correctional Center for allegedly conspiring toviolate the U.S. embargo of Iran, said Patrick O'Brien, head of theU.S. Customs Service in Miami.   Investigators say Breeze schemed with the Iranian ambassador toSpain to sell 10 Sikorsky S-36 helicopters to a European companysecretly owned by the Iranian government. The ambassador intendedto take a cut from the sale, said O'Brien.   ``We are continuing the investigation to look for diversions ofmilitary equipment to Iran,'' he said.   Breeze's arrest Tuesday at the Fort Lauderdale airportapparently ended attempts to lure other conspirators into thecountry, but agents suspect the operation was part of a much largernetwork.   Breeze appeared Wednesday before a federal magistrate, whoordered him held without bond. Another hearing was scheduled forFriday.   ``The S-36 is a military-type helicopter,'' O'Brien said,declining to give details of the case. ``They are basically a troopcarrier, a civilian version of the Blackhawk. These things aregreat over the desert.''   The helicopters were originally sold to the Jordanian air forcein 1979 and 1980. Six were later traded back to Sikorsky butremained in Jordan, and all 10 were for sale at $675,000 each.   Sikorsky spokesman Bob Stangarone in Stratford, Conn., confirmedthe company owned the six helicopters but said it had never dealtwith Breeze.   In May, the arrest affidavit says Breeze allegedly approached aninformant for the Customs Service about buying the helicopters forIran. The informant advised Customs, and authorities tapedconversations between the two.   In the conversations, some of which took place in Spain and theUnited Kingdom, Breeze, a British subject, told the informant theultimate purchaser was Iran.   ``Breeze further advised that negotiations for the purchase werebeing conducted through a Spanish national middleman and theIranian Embassy in Madrid,'' Fort Lauderdale Customs agent ThomasBailey said in the affidavit.   Breeze told the informant last week that the sales agreement wason its way by diplomatic pouch from Madrid to Iran for finalapproval. But he later said it was held up because the ambassadorwas insisting on a larger share of the profits.</TEXT></DOC>
