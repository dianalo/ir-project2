In the next decade, Mr. Bauer fears, the federal government may be spending tens of billions of dollars a year on AIDS programs-research, prevention, treatment and education. &quot;If the worst projections {about the spread of the disease} are true, the next president is going to be facing a significant budget problem in dealing with all the consequences of AIDS,&quot; Mr. Bauer says.    The House and Senate have drafted budgets for the next fiscal year that will approximately double the $416 million currently spent on federal AIDS research and prevention.    Public expenditures -- federal, state and local -- are mounting rapidly, from a few million dollars in 1983 to more than $1 billion this year. For hard-hit cities in the urban East, where many AIDS patients are poor and drug-addicted, the epidemic &quot;already is a significant fiscal problem,&quot; says Stephen Joseph, the New York City health commissioner. No end to the upward spiral is in sight.    Pending proposals -- for blood testing, for providing experimental drugs, for expanding benefits -- are sure to gather support as the disease spreads. As of May 11, 20,557 Americans have died of AIDS, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control estimates that 215,000 Americans will have died of the disease by the end of 1991.    &quot;There was a lot of indifference about the whole AIDS epidemic in the beginning,&quot; says Rep. Henry Waxman, a California Democrat, &quot;because the two groups that were affected seemed to be remote and, to some people, dispensable -- the gay man, and the IV drug abuser.&quot; Mr. Waxman, who is the chairman of a House subcommittee on health, believes his efforts to obtain greater federal financing for AIDS programs will receive a major boost because &quot;we already see large numbers of AIDS patients who don't fit into those two categories.&quot; He adds, &quot;We're going to see many more added to the list.&quot; He is referring to middle-class heterosexuals.    Approximately 80 million Americans have inadequate private health-insurance coverage or none at all, according to a major AIDS study by the National Academy of Sciences, including many who are intravenous drug users. So government will end up absorbing a considerable financial burden -- quite possibly the preponderant burden.    The Office of Management and Budget, which has prepared perhaps the only long-range forecast of AIDS expenditures based on current law, estimates that Washington will spend a total of $1.6 billion on AIDS in 1991, including $900 million for the federal share of Medicaid, the federal-state medical care program for the poor. AIDS spending will be a small, but rapidly growing part of the federal budget.    But as Congress responds to AIDS with new programs, the cost is certain to rise. Officials say that:    --Taxpayers will bear a large share of the cost of AIDS-related complex, or ARC, a condition manifested by many carriers of the AIDS virus and a precursor of AIDS. The OMB figures don't include the cost of ARC, even though the debilitating condition is much more prevalent than AIDS, strictly defined, and may thus cost even more, according to the National Academy of Sciences. Many afflicted children of drug addicts require hospitalization for ARC, usually at Medicaid's expense.    --Congress is likely to appropriate between $750 million and $970 million for AIDS research, education and prevention in the next fiscal year; the OMB projection unrealistically assumes that over the next five years lawmakers won't increase the budget beyond President Reagan's $533 million request. The National Academy of Sciences recommended annual spending of $1 billion on research and another $1 billion on education by 1990, figures that lawmakers are said to be taking seriously.    --The experimental drug AZT is becoming available to AIDS victims, and other drugs are being developed. AZT costs as much as $10,000 per patient per year. Most authorities believe that AZT and similar drugs will raise health-care bills substantially. &quot;AZT is not a curative therapy. It's a life-prolonging therapy,&quot; observes William Roper, the administrator of the U.S. Health Care Financing Administration. &quot;It has the impact of adding to health-care expenditures.&quot;    --Medicare, the federal program for the elderly and disabled, could become an important source of funding for AIDS patients who aren't poor. Currently, the program is barely affected by AIDS because the law requires a two-year wait to qualify for disability payments, and most AIDS patients don't live that long after being diagnosed. But lawmakers are considering legislation that would waive the delay for AIDS victims. The administration estimates the cost of such legislation at between $1 billion and $1.5 billion a year in 1991.    Opposition to AIDS spending will become increasingly difficult as the epidemic spreads. Some conservatives privately acknowledge that they may be forced to vote for costly AIDS treatment programs that liberals favor, in order to show compassion and gain public support for the education and mandatory testing some conservatives favor.    In his recent speech advocating mandatory AIDS tests for hospital patients, prisoners and other people, Education Secretary William Bennett said: &quot;We as a society have an obligation to minister to the sick and suffering in our midst. We must, accordingly, do what is necessary to help ensure that families, states, localities, hospitals, hospices and others have the resources to provide adequate medical care and support for those suffering from this disease.&quot;    In New York City, the municipal hospital system, known as the Health and Hospitals Corp., is becoming increasingly crowded with AIDS patients, many of them indigent and drug-addicted. Fifty percent of the beds in some of the system's 11 hospitals are occupied by AIDS patients, says Jo Ivey Boufford, the agency's director, who laments that the AIDS problem has arisen at a time when Washington is cutting its aid to local government.    Some liberals see in the AIDS catastrophe the potential emergence of a comprehensive federal medical-care program. &quot;The AIDS epidemic really underscores and graphically illustrates the huge gaps we have in our health care system,&quot; says Rep. Waxman. Imagine, he says, what will happen when insurance companies refuse coverage to people -- currently believed to number 1.5 million -- found to have been exposed to the AIDS virus. Such individuals will then be unable to afford care for their other medical problems. And the burden of care will fall on taxpayers.
