 Lasermaster claims thatTurboRes virtually eliminates rough stairstep edges on graphics and largecharacters.andP;  I was very impressed by the output quality.andP;  Even under amagnifying glass it's impossible to see any steps.andP;  Toner and paper qualitybecome more of a problem at this level of resolution.andM;Increasing vertical resolution with a laser printer tends to be difficult,because the resolution and placement of raster scan lines is determined bythe scan rate of the laser beam and the speed at which paper travels throughthe printer - factors which aren't variable.andM;Lasermaster has got round this by controlling the height as well as the widthof individual pixels.andP;  The company's boast is that TurboRes requires nomodification of hardware or increase in memory.andM;TurboRes will be included with all LX6/4, LX6/6 and LM1000 controllersshipped after 15 December.andP;  Controllers bought after Comdex will include avoucher for a free TurboRes upgrade.andP;  Using the LX6/4 and LX6/6 controllers,TurboRes increases resolution from 600x300 to a virtual 600x600.andM;Also at Comdex, Lasermaster launched Fontmaster, another piece of softwarewhich will be bundled with the Lasermaster 1000.andP;  It will convert an outlinefont from your library to Lasermaster's proprietary LXO format.andP;  Onceimported, fonts can be manipulated - flipped, squeezed, combined, shrunk orflattened.andP;  Adapted fonts can be assigned to the keyboard and accessed withjust one key press.andM;The Lasermaster 1000 system comes with 35 typefaces as standard.andP;  Extra facescan be added from the Bitstream Fontware Collection and from the AdobePostScript typeface library.andP;  All type can be scaled from outlines in anysize from one to an unusable 1,200 points, without bitmaps on disk, with nofont cartridges and no downloading.andP;  The system also allows special effects,including font rotation in one degree increments and the use of differentshades.andM;Lasermaster got in on the OS/2 act at Comdex by announcing a PresentationManager/GPI (Graphical Programmer Interface) controller.andP;  The controllercomes in versions for the HP Laserjet and the Lasermaster 1000 printers.andP;  Thecard bypasses the controller in an HP Laserjet turning it into a native modePM printer.andM;The main disadvantage of the Lasermaster approach is probably the lack ofPostScript compatibility.andP;  Lasermaster does have a PostScript interpreter butit slows the card down drastically, so, realistically, you're restricted topackages that Lasermaster has drivers for.andP;  The other drawback is that youneed an internal controller for each machine which is attached to the printerbut, if camera quality output is what you need, Lasermaster is definitelyworth considering.andM;In the UK, the LM1000 typesetting system cost 7,950 pounds sterling,including the TurboRes and Fontmaster software.andP;  The upgrade for existingusers costs $100 in the States but no UK price has yet been announced.andO;Lasermaster UK can be contacted on (042 121) 6235.andM;RIPS 4000iandM;RIPS (Raster Image Processing Systems) is another contender in thehigh-resolution laser controller stakes.andM;The Image 4000i controller was launched at Comdex and uses the recentlyannounced Intel 80960 KB RISC chip.andP;  Teh new controller supersedes the Image4000 which was based on the Weitek RISC chip.andM;The new Intel chips run at 25MHz and RIPS claims that the new chips almostdouble the speed of their existing controller.andP;  Up to 4Mb of DRAMs can befitted to the board, but memory can be expanded up to a total of 52Mb withadditional plug-in memory cards.andP;  The modular design of the controller meansthat up to 16 different devices can be run from one raster image processor.andM;RIPS claims its products are faster than Lasermaster's, with the addedadvantage of PostScript compatibility, but RIPS can't match Lasermaster's1000x1000 virtual resolution.andP;  The best it can manage is 800x400dpi from theCanon 400dpi engine.andM;RIP's products are distributed in the UK by Hi Trak on (0908) 221 441.andM;Canon NavigatorandM;The Canon Navigator was launched at Comdex.andP;  It claims to be the firstintegrated telephone, answering machine, fax machine and PC.andM;Superficially, the Navigator is a fairly slick-looking machine moulded fromblack plastic with a matching black keyboard.andP;  In Japan, the Navigator is thecheapest of a family of integrated machines.andP;  The $3,000 price tag isintended to arouse maximum interest in the US as quickly as possible, butlooking closely at the machine it's evident that it's been built down to aprice.andM;The 10-inch monochrome EGA touch-sensitive screen is small and not terriblyclear, the keyboard is unimpressive and the telephone looks tinny, to say theleast.andP;  The processor is an 8086, so the Navigator isn't super fast, but thepresence of a V50 cpu (which controls the fax) allows simultaneous use of thefax or telephone and the PC.andM;A hard disk is an optional extra on the Canon Navigator, so normal operationis from a floppy disk, which inevitably slows things down.andP;  The Navigator issupplied with twin 1.44Mb 3-1/2-inch floppy disk drives, 640Kb of RAM and hastwo 8-bit expansion slots.andM;The Navigator is controlled by using graphical icons on the touch screen andhas a phone book on a floppy disk which can load up to 300 telephone and faxnumbers.andM;These can be accessed on screen when the telephone receiver is lifted.andP;  Youtouch the appropriate name and the number dials automatically.andP;  Telephonenumbers are indexed alphabetically and there's also automatic redialling,on-hook dialling and a hold melody to infuriate your callers with.andP;  Theunit's built-in answering machine is capable of storing up to 12 calls.andM;Fax transmission uses the same on-screen control as the telephone dialler andthere's a certain amount of junk fax capability.andP;  The Navigator can be set upto send a document to up to 100 different locations, and there's a delayedtransmission feature to take advantage of cheap telephone rates.andP;  TheNavigator can also receive faxes to disk and will default to disk if theprinter paper runs out.andM;The Navigator has an integrated thermal printer for outputting faxes ordrafting documents (quality wasn't that impressive), but a parallel portallows a conventional printer to be hooked up if required.andM;At Comdex, Canon was unsure what software the Navigator would be suppliedwith, but said that it was involved in discussions with a number of differentsoftware houses about bundling the Navigator with an integrated softwarepackage.andM;The Navigator may look good, but the question is whether it's really anybetter than a PC fitted out with a fax card and a dialler with a telephoneand answering machine beside it on the desk.andP;  The communications are betterintegrated on the Navigator and possibly easier to use, and there's the bonusof a thermal printer.andP;  But the price to pay in terms of screen quality ispretty heavy and there's no modem.andP;  I really wouldn't want to work on theNavigator for more than a couple of hours a day.andP;  Realistically, it'sprobably better to think of the Navigator as a flexible replacement for theoffice fax machine.andM;The Canon Navigator costs $2,995 in the US, but no UK shipping date or pricehas been announced as yet.andM;LAWNandM;The LAWN (Local Area Wireless Network) claims to be the first off-the-shelfwireless network.andP;  For $495 you get a radio transmitter, cables and software.andM;The LAWN transmits UHF spread-spectrum radio waves.andP;  According to O'NeillCommunications, which manufactures the product, spread-spectrum radio wasdeveloped during World War II.andP;  It literally spreads the signal out over amuch wider bandwidth and at a lower power density, making it difficult todetect, which increases data security.andP;  It's also unlikely to interfere withany other office equipment.andM;An error detection scheme maintains data integrity using AX.25 - aradio-based equivalent of X.25.andP;  Any packet for which an acknowledgementisn't received is re-sent.andM;Although lots of nodes are possible with LAWN the product is really aimed atsmall businesses or workgroups - networks with 2 to 20 users where it's noteconomic or easy to install a hardwired network.andP;  LAWN has a range of 100feet but this can be extended by using a LAWN transmitter as a repeater tobounce data across a greater distance.andM;Installation is very straightforward.andP;  All you have to do is attach the radiotransmitter to your serial port, plug the transmitter into the mains, shove adisk into your A: drive, type install and answer eight simple questions.andM;Because LAWN sends signals straight from one PC to any other machine on thenetwork, no fileserver is necessary.andP;  As LAWN uses the serial port, it'sslower than a conventional network but it gets round this problem to someextent by operating in background mode.andP;  Files which you want to send arespooled onto your hard disk to be sent later.andM;When you run the LAWN the list of users on the network user list isautomatically installed because, as the salesman put it, &quot;each unit beaconsout with its name.&quot;andM;To any name on the list of users you can send files or mail, read mail, orcheck your out box.andP;  This last feature is particularly useful-if you'vespooled a lot of data that you're sending to other people on the network youcan check the out box to see who you've sent a message to, what the messagewas about, whether a file was enclosed and the exact time that it was sent.andO;The data will be spooled until the network is free to send.andM;Although the software isn't currently TSR, (Terminate and Stay Resident)there's a printing TSR (memory overhead 40Kb) which allows you to print to aremote printer from within an application.andP;  The next version of the software,due to be launched in the first quarter of 1990, should be completely TSR,allowing the software to be popped up with a hotkey.andP;  The company did saythat it had some problems running LAWN with Sidekick which it's hoping toclear up with the next software release.andM;LAWN is designed to be easy to set up and maintenance-free.andP;  The manufactureralso includes unlimited 0800 (free phone) hotline support.andP;  O'NeillCommunications was unable to say when it would be shipping in the UK, andexplained that obtaining the necessary approval for a radio-based LAN couldtake some time.andM;Smart Label PrinterandM;The Smart Label Printer weighs less than a pound, and is just 3.6 inches wideand a little over six inches high.andM;The printer connects directly to the serial port of a PC and is thermal,which means good letter quality output and very quiet operation.andM;The printer isn't intended to replace a desktop printer, but to provide acheap efficient solution to the problem of printing labels.andP;  This it solvesvery effectively, and churns out labels at the rate of one every 15 seconds.andO;You might think this is slow, but because the printer is driven by a TSRprogram, which can be popped up from within applications, and because itprints entirely in background mode, its speed is unlikely to matter.andM;The printer costs just $249.95 including software (with its own database,text editor and bar code generator), serial cable and a roll of 130self-adhesive labels.andP;  Extra labels cost $12.95 per pack of two rolls of 130labels each.andP;  When I asked if I could borrow one, Seiko said it was sellingthem as fast as it could make them, which isn't really surprising.andM;FancardandM;Microtech is one of the many of tiny computer companies that seem to havepopped up all over California.andM;At Comdex it launched the Fancard-I and the Fancard-II.andP;  The Fancard isexactly what it's name suggests -- a fan on a card.andP;  It's a full-length cardequipped with a large LED to show that the power is on, which fits into an 8or 16-bit slot and keeps your chips cool.andM;Fancard-I has one fan and costs $79.95, Fancard-II has two fans for maximumcooling power and costs $99.95.andP;  Each fan consumes 2.4W of power, creates32dB of noise (I could hardly hear it over the hum of the Comdex floor) andit has a life expectancy of around 30,000 hours.andM;Microtech is currently looking for a UK distributor but it might be preparedto send you one if you phone (0101 213) 644 0859.andM;WorldPort 2400/MNPandM;Touchbase communications demonstrated what it claims is the world's smallestMNP Class 5 portable external modem.andM;The WorldPort 2400/MNP has error correction and data compression facilitiesto allow fast error free transmission of data over the telephone line.andP;  Thenew modem is battery-powered, will plug into practically any computer'sserial port and allows telephone connection through direct contact or by wayof an acoustic coupler.andM;Other features include 'AT' command set compatibility, auto-dial,auto-answer, auto-rate select, a speaker and LED indicators.andM;The WorldPort 2400/MNP will retail for $499 in the US and should be availableon this side of the pond early next year.andP;  UK pricing hasn't yet beendecided, and Andest Communications, which distributes Touchbase products inthe UK, is currently seeking approval for the new modem.andM;Also at Comdex, Touchbase launched an internal version of its 2496 Fax/Datamodem (reviewed, issue 120).andP;  The new product is designed to fit into theinternal slot of any Toshiba laptop, and it's likely to cost around 700 poundsterling.andP;  It will be available next year from Andest Communications on (090)837 1572.andM;LapLink Mac IIIandM;Traveling Software showed a new version of its Mac to PC file transferprogram--Laplink Mac III Connectivity Pac.andM;The new product is faster than previous versions and adds four tupes ofMac-to-Mac file transfer methods including direct cable, telephone modem,AppleTalk and direct SCSI for the new Macintosh portable.andP;  The specialuniversal cable supplied with the package will link Macs to other Macs or toIBM-compatible PCs.andM;Laplink Mac III has doubled its file transfer speed between a Mac and a PC toover 115,000bps.andP;  Mac-to-Mac communication has been boosted 500 per cent to750,000bps (the best part of 3Mb per minute).andP;  The SCSI Disk Link softwarewill send data between a Mac portable and another Mac at a very rapid 10Mbps.andM;File transfer between a Macintosh and a PC can be controlled from eithermachine.andP;  A similar split-screen display shows on both sides--both havepull-down menus and point and click mouse support.andP;  The software does lookgenuinely easy to use.andP;  File translator now automatically translate betweenpopular PC and Macintosh word processor formats.andM;LapLink Mac III will be available in January and will cost 140 poundsterling, including a universal cable and all the software on Macintosh andIBM 3-1/2-inch and IBM 5-1/4-inch disks.andP;  An upgrade will cost existingLapLink Mac users 65 pound sterling.andP;  Anybody who's purchased LapLink MacVersion 2.0 since 1 October 1989 will pay 45 pound sterling.andM;Softsel distributes Traveling Software products in the UK and the company canbe reached on (01) 568 8866.andM;Raster DevicesandM;Raster Devices Direct is an American company which acts as an OEM forLasermaster products and packages them as complete DTP solutions.andP;  There'sone thing, however, which it offers that Lasermaster doesn't.andP;  Give thecompany a standard 300dpi HP Laserjet II and $4,995 (or $5,495 for the MCAversion) and amazingly, RDD will convert it to produce 1,000x1,000dpi outputusing Lasermaster's TurboRes software.andP;  Unfortunately, Raster Devices won'tbe operating in the UK in the near future.andM;GoscriptandM;LaserGo, maker of the Goscript Post-Script printing utility software,announced Goscript 3.0.andP;  Version 3.0 includes output to PCX or TIFF formats,a menu-driven interface, an EGA/VGA Print Preview and the Goprint printingutility.andP;  The Goprint utility allows users to print ordinary text files aswell as PostScript files in any GoFonts typeface at any size.andM;Goscript 386, also announced, takes advantage of the 386 chip's 32-bitarchitecture and, according to Goscript, is over twice as fast as standardGoscript.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
