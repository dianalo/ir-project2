The hydrostatic transmissionenables both variable rotor speed as well as driving a synchronous generatordirectly coupled to the grid. With the experience of this wind turbineBohemen Energy Systems is now developing a 225/300 kW wind turbine (WE321/85). The paper describes the development of this wind turbine.</TEXT></DOC>
