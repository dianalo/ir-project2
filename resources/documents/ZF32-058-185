continues the transformation of thecompany's high-end business by introducing both new market perspectives andproducts.andP;  Near-term issues are, as always, dominated by IBM's ability tomove mainframe hardware.andP;  IBM's fourth quarter will get a strong boost fromgeneral availability of its two &quot;Thoroughbred&quot; 9021 models.andP;  Newly announcedair-cooled and water-cooled machines will help soften any dip in businessduring the first half of 1992, believes IDC.andP;  However, IDC analyst SteveJosselyn thinks that until a larger percentage of customers have a greaterunderstanding of IBM's new hardware, networking and software tools thatbusiness will be soft.andP;  &quot;The fact remains that it will take at least untilthe third quarter of 1992 for penetration rates to approach the necessary 25%range.&quot; For the past year, IDC has maintained that IBM's troubles wereprimarily related to two factors - availability of new technology machinesand challenges of diffusing a tremendous mass of new technologies into anincreasingly mature mainframe market.andP;  By announcing general availability ofthe ES/9000 820 and 900, by announcing shipment dates for four additional9021 machines, and by introducing new higher-end 9121 models, IBM takes greatstrides towards solving the first problem.andP;  However, the second problem, ofdiffusing the new features and functions, still remains.andP;  And as IDC has saidin the past, for IBM to exploit fully the competitive advantages that flowfrom controlling the S/390 architecture, it must get customers to adopt atleast a baseline set of enabler technologies.andP;  Nonetheless, the prioritiesbeing communicated in the announcement and the structure of the announcementitself, in IDC's opinion, indicate that IBM is dedicating itself to not onlydeliver product to an overall market, but to get critical sets of tools intoand used by customer hands.andP;  The major theme of this announcement is&quot;Integrating the Enterprise.&quot; Obviously, this is an ambitious undertaking.andO;Not surprisingly, therefore, this announcement, in many respects, is morecomplex than last year's action.andP;  Whereas the issues of hysical and financialupgradeability dominated much of last year's announcement, this year IBM'sES/9000 processor pricing and upgrade strategy benefits from a year offamiliarity.andP;  Most of the functions announced last year - new performancelevels, ESCON, Sysplex, - were understandable, even if obviously only abeginning and difficult to commensurate in terms of benefits.andP;  This year'sannouncement, on the other hand, doesn't benefit from a focal point asreadily obvious as new machines.andP;  The focus here is software and systemsintegration, by definition an amorphous topic.andP;  According to Josselyn, &quot;thisis a transition announcement, one concerned not so much with technologydiscontinuities, but rather with scopes and rates of technology changes.andO;'Integrating the Enterprise' is a significant theme, but one that comprisesdozens of major threads, each pushing hard in different directions.&quot; And theannouncement does, indeed, push in so many directions that IBM recentlyundertook a reorganisation in part to pave the way for today.andP;  IBM's officialtheme may be &quot;Integrating the Enterprise,&quot; but beneath those words are fiveimportant perspectives that will dominate IBM's enterprise strategy for yearsto come.andP;  The first is that the announcement indicates a sense of urgency anda willingness to adopt new ways of business at IBM.andP;  The second isintegrating the mainframe with the desktop - 10 years ago, IBM spoke of theneed, over time, to incorporate the PC world into the glass house, today thatimperative has been reversed: it is the mainframe that must be incorporatedinto the desktop world.andP;  Thirdly, the announcment was an openness manifestoas IBM derived much of its new language and perspectives from the &quot;opensystems&quot; movement.andP;  Some, no doubt, will accuse IBM of expediency, but IDC'ssense is that the company is taking a realistic approach: no matter what arethe promises of newer, more open technologies, their adoption can't bepurchased at the tremendous cost of retiring all installed assets.andP;  However,two aspects are still missing - clear statements of intention about AIX andSAA integration and IBM perspectives on supporting IBM software on non-IBMplatforms.andP;  The fourth perspective is partnerships and priorities.andM;Unprecedented use of partnershipsandM;IBM's relations with partners have grown in both numbers and magnitude overthe past few years, but the scope and essential nature of the partnerships ofthis announcement are unprecedented - for example the use of InformationBuilder Inc's EDA/SQL in the Information Warehouse.andP;  IBM's actions indicatethat priorities are swinging away from marketing point products to marketingcohesive collections of offerings derived from IBM and non-IBM sources.andO;Finally, after a long absence, the systems marketing concept seems to havereturned to IBM.andP;  The idea of selling not just disenfranchised products,programs and services, but what can be called &quot;us-age scenarios,&quot; is asignificant step forward.andP;  From this announcement, IDC would translate&quot;Inte-grating the Enterprise&quot; as &quot;how Big Blue Plans Tra-nsforming theMainframe Into an Enterprise Server.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
