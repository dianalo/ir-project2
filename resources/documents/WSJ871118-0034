Garcia</HL><DD> 11/18/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)STOCK INDEXES (NDX) </IN><TEXT>   Stock prices sagged in lethargic trading yesterday as investor attention in the U.S. and abroad remained focused on the equally slow-moving deficit-reduction talks in Washington.    Trading in the U.S. market opened on a sour note, taking its cue from a lower dollar and weakness in some foreign equity markets. Despite repeated assurances from congressional leaders that they will reach a budget-trimming pact with the White House before the end of the week, skepticism about their resolve depressed the dollar in New York and European trading.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled more than 50 points early in the session and remained at that level until the final hour. Bargain-hunting helped pare the losses, and the average finished 26.85 lower at 1922.25.    While traders said that selling pressure wasn't intense, the decline in yesterday's market was widespread. Three issues declined for every one that advanced on the New York Stock Exchange.    Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index dropped 3.72 to 243.04, and the Big Board's composite index fell 1.95 to 136.21.    Volume on the Big Board slowed to 148.3 million shares from 164.3 million Monday.    &quot;Investors aren't going to take a stand on the market until something definitive comes from Washington. That's why everyone is suddenly a trader and not a long-term investor,&quot; said one New York-based equity trader.    Fred Lange, president of Lange Financial Services, said that the slow progress of the deficit-narrowing negotiations is &quot;almost an international embarrassment&quot; and reflects &quot;a lack of leadership in Washington.&quot;    The budget talks yesterday centered on finding $5 billion in savings from entitlement programs without touching any automatic cost-of-living adjustment provisions.    The lawmakers face a Friday deadline for coming up with a bipartisan accord to trim the budget. Otherwise, the Gramm-Rudman law calls for $23 billion to be cut automatically.    John Connolly, a portfolio strategist with Dean Witter Reynolds, said that investors' intense interest in the attempt to trim the federal budget &quot;wasn't out of place.&quot; He explained that fiscal spending was one part of the economy &quot;that had been overdone in the last five years. You can't keep straining the system indefinitely. Retrenchment had to happen at some point.&quot;    Yet, even with a budget-cutting pact for this fiscal year and the next, Mr. Connolly believes the economy and the stock market might not be out of the woods altogether. He noted that the savings rate for consumers has dropped to a postwar low and their debt has increased considerably in the past five years. As consumers pare their spending, it may hurt companies that cater to them as well as the broader economy.    Several retailing stocks fell yesterday, in part because of the lower dollar and in some cases because of third-quarter financial results. J.C. Penney declined 1 3/4 to 43 5/8 despite a 47% increase in quarterly profit and a 7.8% sales gain. The increase in net income was within the range predicted by analysts, but Edward Weller, an analyst at Montgomery Securities, noted that inventories increased faster than sales in the period.    Dayton Hudson was off 1 to 29 1/8. It reported flat net income for the latest quarter. Zayre dropped 3/8 to 18 7/8 on slightly lower third-quarter net.    Federated Department Stores rose 3/8 to 35 1/2. It reported a 14% increase in third-quarter net over year-earlier operating profit. Mr. Weller said Federated recently had been leading analysts to expect a somewhat smaller increase.    Among the losers yesterday were oil shares. The Wall Street Journal reported that continued heavy production by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, combined with Iran's efforts to market its oil, are putting new pressure on world petroleum prices. Exxon declined 3/4 to 40 1/2, Atlantic Richfield dropped 1 3/4 to 73, Mobil was off 1 5/8 to 35 7/8, and Chevron fell 1/8 to 40 1/4.    British Petroleum, traded as American depositary receipts, bucked the trend amid rumors of heavy buying by the Kuwait Investment Office and Japanese investors. Analysts were skeptical about the rumored Kuwaiti buying, but BP gained 2 1/4 to 54 7/8 while its recently issued, partially paid shares rose 1 1/4 to 18. Analysts said the yield on the recently issued shares is very attractive.    Traders said stocks that are regarded as takeover or buy-out candidates continued to face selling pressure in the wake of financing problems for some proposed takeovers. Gillette was down 1 1/8 to 29 7/8, MCA was off 1/2 to 36 7/8, Allegis fell 1/4 to 71 1/2, and Sante Fe Southern Pacific declined 7/8 to 48 1/4.    Dun andamp; Bradstreet fell 5/8 to 52 5/8 after the company abandoned its bid to buy Information Resources in the face of regulatory opposition on antitrust grounds. In national over-the-counter trading, Information Resources plunged 8 to 13.    Homestake Mining rose 1 1/4 to 15 3/4, and KN Energy gained 3/8 to 15 3/4 on Mesa LP's disclosure that it held stakes in the two concerns of 4.8% and 4.5% respectively as of Sept. 30.    Bear Stearns declined 5/8 to 10 3/8 after reporting a 99% plunge in second-quarter earnings. The results reflected big trading losses during last month's stock market crash and sluggish revenue earlier in the quarter.    Allied-Signal gained 1 5/8 to 33 on volume of 4.8 million shares, making it the Big Board's most active issue. The company said that as part of a program to boost profitability it would focus its aerospace business on existing markets and wouldn't pursue a big expansion of its defense systems business.    American Telephone andamp; Telegraph slipped 7/8 to 28 5/8. It proposed an $800 million annual rate cut on its long-distance service beginning Jan. 1. The cut reflects some reductions in ATandamp;T's costs to connect to local phone companies.    Financial Corp. of America, parent of American Savings andamp; Loan Associaton, lost 1/4 to 2 1/4. American Savings said its institutional deposits declined nearly 20% in the third quarter.    CNW gained 3/4 to 24 3/4. The company accepted a proposal from an investor group led by Gibbons, Green van Amerongen to acquire CNW in a deal valued at $578 million, or $31 a share. </TEXT></DOC>
