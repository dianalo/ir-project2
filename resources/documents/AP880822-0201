In its place Parliament has adopted a new code and courtroomprocedures that the government hopes will reflect Italy's postwardemocracy.   To strengthen the rights of defendants the new laws demandjudicial consent for arrest warrants, severely restrict pre-trialdetention and require prosecutors to explain charges and show theirevidence during a hearing shortly after an arrest.   ``We are finding that the code formed in 1942 under the Fascistsdoes not fit Italy's new democracy after the war,'' said RiccardoDalla Vedova, a Rome defense lawyer who has studied the reforms.   Under the old code some defendants awaiting trial languished injail for as long as six years. A prosecutor could order an arrestand the defense would not get a look at the evidence until afterthe investigation was complete, sometimes shortly before trial.   The reforms also allow prosecutors to plea bargain, to tradereduced charges or sentences for testimony that can convict crimebosses and terrorist masterminds.   Another change abolishes the verdict of ``not guilty for lack ofevidence.'' The finding is short of complete innocence and leaves acloud of suspicion over the defendants, such as the three Turks andthree Bulgarians acquitted of plotting to kill Pope John Paul II in1981.   The new code will go into force gradually between now andOctober 1989.   ``It solves the problems of pre-trial detention, which I have toadmit is one of the wickedest parts of our system,'' said DallaVedova.   The detentions began in the 1970s, when the state struggled tosubdue growing political terrorism from both the far left and right.   ``With the kidnapping and killing of (former) Premier (Aldo)Moro, attacks at the very heart of the state, we had to defendourselves,'' said Dalla Vedova.   But while the pre-trial detention was created to cope with theviolence, lawyers and prosecutors agree that it came to be usedeven for minor crimes.   Pre-trial detention now is reserved for murder, kidnapping andterrorism. And prosecutors must convince a judge it is necessary.Prisoners awaiting trial can petition for their release.   Dalla Vedova and lawyers Giorgio Cherubini and Quirino Mancinisaid that in common law countries such as the United States the lawevolves by precedent, by Supreme Court decisions.   But in Italy, changes must be written into the law becausejudges are not bound by earlier high court opinions.   ``In Italy a young judge can interpret a law in a completelydifferent way than the Supreme Court interpreted it just 10 daysbefore,'' said Dalla Vedova.   Italian media often refer to the new code as the ``Perry MasonSystem.'' But Erle Stanley Gardner's fictitious lawyer could wellbe lost in Italy where more than 90 percent of the trials are heardby a judge, not a jury.   Still the reforms will allow Italian lawyers for the first timeto directly question and cross-examine witnesses rather thansuggesting their questions to the presiding judge.   Prosecutors now must advise defendants of the charges anddisclose their evidence to the defense during a pre-trial hearingwithin 10 days of arrest. Evidence that had been kept secret untilthe end of an investigation now must be shared with the defenseduring a series of other pre-trial hearings.   The reforms also curtail the powers of investigatingmagistrates, who in the past gathered evidence, determined whetherto prosecute and ordered the arrest.   ``It is right that one changes, and the quicker the better, themusical score for the criminal trial that is out of tune with astate that wants to be truely democratic,'' Corrado Carnevale, ajudge with the Court of Cassation, Italy's highest criminal court,told a recent conference on the new code.   As crime became more complicated and sophisticated, and as theinvestigations became more intricate and involved, Italy createdthe ``maxi-trial,'' such as the Mafia trial in Palermo that had 476defendants.   It gave the government a way to deal with massive, organizedinternational crime.   ``The handicap is no human mind can absorb 476 positions andsort out all the evidence for and against,'' said Dalla Vedova.   So now prosecutors can use plea bargaining to uncover newevidence and to help separate the trials of the principaldefendants.   Besides the new code, Italy has taken other measures to give itscriminal justice system the image of fairness. It has made judgesliable for damages if they make errors by intent or grossnegligence. At the urging of Socialist leader Bettino Craxi, whoconsidered the practice humiliating, police also have been slowerto clamp handcuffs on people they arrest.   Another measure to be adopted will give journalists immunityfrom being required to reveal sources on crime stories. And othersseek to deal with the backlog in Italian courts by depenalizingsome offenses or making them subject only to fines.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Thurs PMs Sept. 1</NOTE></DOC>
