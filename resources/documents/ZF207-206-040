McGrath, director of DOD's CALS office and the lead speaker onThursday morning, has said the expected benefits of CALS will include 35percent improvement in troubleshooting accuracy, 20 percent estimated savingsover system life cycles and up to 30 percent savings on technical manualpreparation.andM;Other DOD speakers include Alfredo Campo of the assistant Army secretary'sinstallations and logistics office; Rear Adm.andP;  Guy Curtis, assistant to thedeputy chief of naval operations for logistics; Oscar Goldfarb, deputy to theassistant Air Force secretary for supply maintenance and logistics; andWalter Simonson, chief of the Defense Logistics Agency's research anddevelopment office.andM;The CALS industry viewpoint will be presented by Harold Stormfeltz, vicechairman of the CALS industry steering group; Robert Kiggins, general managerof PDES Inc.; and Robert I. Winner, chief scientist of the Institute ofDefense Analyses' computer and software engineering division.andM;Additional CALS speakers are Bruce Lepisto, deputy director of DOD's CALSoffice; Robert Middleton of Westinghouse Electric Corp.'s digital informationexchange task group; David Bettwy, deputy chief of the National Institute ofStandards and Technology's automated production tecnology division; PamGennusa of Datalogics Inc.; George Desiderio of the assistant defensesecretary's weapon support improvement group; and Mel Lammers, CALS testnetwork program manager for the Air Force Logistics command.andM;Under CALS, diverse information about weapons systems will be created onlyonce but used many times in many places.andP;  CALS will permit DOD and itscontractors to exchange data on design, engineering, manufacturing, technicalmanuals, training, reliability, maintenance, spare parts, materialrequirements planning and logistics support analysis.andM;Phase 1 of CALS, the definition of standards for digital information flowinterfaces, is underway now.andP;  Phase 2, in which multiple DOD and contractorweapon systems databases will be integrated, is planned for completion by theend of 1992.andM;The first DOD acquisitions to implement CALS will be the Air Force advancedtactical fighter, the Navy A-12 advanced tactical aircraft, the Army LHXlight helicopter, and the Navy V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft.andP;  All willshare common avionics packages.andM;Future weapons systems being planned under CALS include antitank weapons,intercontinental ballistics missiles, radars and bombers.andM;CALS standards adopted to date include a military standard for datainterchange file management; the initial graphics exchange specification oftechnical manual illustrations and computer-aided design drawings; and thestandard generalized markup language for publishing.andM;Also the international Group 4 raster-scanned image standard for engineeringdrawings; the computer graphics metafile standard for vector graphics; and ahandbook for creating model statements of work and contract data requirementslists.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
