LOUIS  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Concept Development Inc. said it offered to buy Pizza Inn Inc. for an indicated $45.7 million, or $13.85 a share, in cash and stock.    Concept is offering 1.4 Concept shares and $3 in cash for each of Pizza Inn's 3.3 million common shares. Concept, which owns or franchises 125 Pantera's Pizza restaurants, said acquiring Pizza Inn would allow it to expand into new regions. Pizza Inn owns or franchises more than 700 pizza restaurants, Concept said.    A Concept spokesman described the offer as &quot;friendly.&quot; An investor group that includes Pizza Inn Chairman F.J. Spillman has been trying to take Pizza Inn private through a leveraged buyout for several months. The group, which has offered $12.50 a share in cash, has had difficulty finding financing for its $38 million offer.    In a leveraged buyout, a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely with borrowing. Ultimately the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or the sale of its assets.    In Dallas, Pizza Inn said its board and Mr. Spillman, who is the company's largest shareholder, will review the proposal.    In national over-the-counter trading Friday, Concept's shares closed at $7.75, up 25 cents. Pizza Inn's shares rose $1 to close at $10.25 in American Stock Exchange trading. </TEXT></DOC>
