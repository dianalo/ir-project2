The information in magnetic resonanceimaging (MRI) can be derived from these signals in any orthogonal plane.Hydrogen is the most abundant of such nuclei, occurring naturally inwater and lipid, and can be detected at relatively low magnetic fieldstrength (0.04 tesla (T) upwards). The MR signal from hydrogen dependsnot only on the proton density and the T/sub 1/ and T/sub 2/ relaxationtimes of those protons following radio-frequency pulse disturbances,but also on the timing parameters of the radio-frequency pulse sequencesemployed. Image contrast depends on the interaction between all thesefactors; not simply as in X-ray computed tomography (CT) on the propertiesof the tissue itself. Therefore an understanding of both the imagingprocess and the pathology under investigation is essential in the properuse of MRI.</TEXT></DOC>
