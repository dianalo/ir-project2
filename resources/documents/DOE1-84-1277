The objective ofderegulation is to ensure that market forces are reflected, to the extentpossible, in the industry's operations. Limits to the practical, legal,and regulatory aspects of deregulation are outlined and the danger ofseeing deregulation in terms of perfect competition is illustrated withthe example of the bypassing of franchised distribution systems to connectend users directly to interprovincial transmission lines. The ways inwhich to find an optimum balance between deregulation and market forcesare noted, and criteria for ensuring such a balance include the applicabilityto the long-term nature of the industry, the even implementation of deregulationto all interest groups, the presence of competition at both the marketand supply ends of the gas pipeline, the suitability of government taxationpolicies, and the ability of the industry to form a concensus on majorissues.</TEXT></DOC>
