The 41-year-old electronics engineer was also ordered Friday topay a $5,000 fine by state Judge Stephen Crane, who said Goetz hadshown no remorse for his actions.   ``I do feel this case is really more about the deterioration ofsociety than it is about me,'' said Goetz, whose 1984 shootings ofthe men he said were trying to rob him prompted debates on racism,self-defense and vigilantism.   Assistant District Attorney Gregory Waples ``seemed, I'm sorry tosay, to believe that society needs to be protected from me,'' Goetzsaid.   ``Well, I don't believe that's the case,'' he said. ``I believesociety needs to be protected from criminals.''   Goetz fled to New Hampshire after the shootings and latersurrendered. He told police he fired the .38-caliber revolver inself-defense because he felt he was about to be robbed; the menclaimed they were panhandling.   Three of the four, all 19 at the time, recovered from theshooting. One, Darrell Cabey, was left brain-damaged and partiallyparalyzed.   Goetz was acquitted of attempted murder and other charges in hisJune 1987 trial. An appeals court upheld the gun possessionconviction last year, but threw out the original six-month jailsentence, saying it did not meet the requirements under state law,which mandates a one-year sentence.   Under the one-year jail sentence, Goetz gets credit for the ninedays he served immediately after his arrest, becoming eligible forparole in 51 days.   Goetz, who faced a new sentence of up to seven years, decided togo ahead with the sentencing even though he has asked the U.S.Supreme Court to review the case because he wants to get the jailtime over with, said his attorney, Mark Baker.   His other attorney, Barry Slotnick, had asked the judge to limitGoetz's sentence to the nine days he already served, pleading, ``Lethim go home where he belongs. ... He has lived in a fish bowl and heshould not go to jail.''   The prosecutor said Goetz ``richly deserves to be punished'' andcalled him ``a potential danger to himself and New York society.''Waples sought a one-year sentence with supervised parole so Goetzwould be forced to undergo psychiatric treatment.   Crane said Goetz's failure to show remorse for the crime ``gaveme concern he might recidivate in possessing a firearm'' and addedthat a jail term ``would not be unduly harsh.''   Goetz left immediately for the Rikers Island jail. The CorrectionDepartment agreed to a defense request that Goetz be kept inprotective custody there, said Baker.   Two jurors from Goetz's trial attended Friday's sentencing:Catherine Brody, a college librarian, and Diana Serpe, an airlinereservations clerk.   ``We felt we were so intensely involved and we had to follow itthrough,'' said Brody. ``The problem is, it is the law, and as it isthe law, we feel it has to be followed or a signal is sent that thelaw doesn't mean anything.''   Ron Kuby, a lawyer representing Cabey in a multimillion-dollarlawsuit against Goetz, called the sentence an outrage and said it``gives license to bigots and lunatics all over the city of New Yorkto go out and blast people who they hate and fear.''   ``I have spoken to Mrs. Cabey (Darrell's mother),'' Kuby said.``She expected this but she is disappointed. She was hoping a stiffsentence would prevent other people from going out and doing toblack youth what Bernhard Goetz did to Darrell Cabey. Unfortunately,that's not going to happen.''</TEXT></DOC>
