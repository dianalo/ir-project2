Bentsen Sr. was eulogized Thursdayfor a ``life he invested in other people'' in a funeral attended bymore than 1,000 people, including his U.S. senator son and MichaelDukakis.   Bentsen, 95, died at the wheel of his automobile Tuesday morningin a two-car crash at a rural intersection in Hidalgo County, in theLower Rio Grande Valley.   The Texas House passed a resolution Thursday that honoredBentsen, an early developer of the state's southern tip along theMexican border, saying ``Texas lost one of its most esteemedcitizens.''   Dr. James Eaves, delivering the sermon at First Baptist Church,hailed the ``complete life'' of Bentsen, who rose early each day andremained active in his agricultural and real estate businesses untilhis death.   Bentsen would be remembered for his hard work, devotion to hisfamily, and his ``life he invested in other people,'' said Eaves,the former interim pastor of Bentsen's church, and a professor atSouthwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth.   ``I remember about the time I asked Senator (Lloyd) Bentsen (Jr.)to run with me, his dad had just done a round trip to San Antonio tonegotiate a land deal and had driven himself up and driven himselfback all in one day, and this man was 95 years of age,'' saidDukakis, Massachusett's governor and the 1988 Democratic Partypresidential candidate, after the funeral.   ``I remember the last rally we had here in McAllen, and he was upon that platform very proud of his son, very proud of the campaignand just a very strong, very good person,'' Dukakis said of theelder Bentsen, who also played a prominent role in the DemocraticNational Convention last summer.   Bentsen grew up one of six children of Danish immigrant parents,thrashing wheat and busting wild horses in South Dakota. He came toTexas in 1917, met his wife, Dolly, and started building his southTexas empire, which included farming, ranching, agricultural,banking, oil and real estate.   He eventually held nearly 50,000 acres of farms and ranches andplayed a major role in the development of Texas' citrus industry.But later he also recognized the need to preserve the border area'svanishing wildlife habitat, and donated land that became the587-acre Bentsen-Rio Grande Valley State Park.   He and Dolly, who died in 1977, had four children: Lloyd M.Bentsen Jr.; Kenneth, a Houston architect; Don, a McAllenbusinessman; and Betty, wife of a wer Rio Grande Valley businessman.</TEXT></DOC>
