JOHN'S, Newfoundland (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Canada's largest offshore oildrilling project has been approved, and construction is expected tobegin almost immediately, the nation's federal energy ministerannounced today.   The formal go-ahead for the $5.2 billion ($4.5 billion U.S.)Hibernia oil project off Newfoundland's coast was announced byfederal Energy Minister Jake Epp as a major advancement for theeconomically troubled Atlantic province.   ``Hibernia will bring jobs and economic diversification toNewfoundland and all of Canada,'' he said. ``The development of theHibernia oil field will diversify Canada's sources of oil supply.The opening up of this new frontier will put Canadians at theleading edge of offshore development technologies.''   The project is a collaboration between the federal government,the province and a consortium of four oil companies led by MobilOil Canada.   Ottawa will contribute $2.7 billion ($2.3 billion U.S.) to theproject in cash and loan guarantees. The rest will come from theoperating companies and Newfoundland, which will help out with taxbreaks during contruction.   The consortium estimates up to $3.1 billion ($2.7 billion U.S.)of the total capital construction costs will go to Canadiancompanies. Production is expected to start in 1996 and last about20 years.   The companies estimate the Hibernia field has recoverable oilreserves of 525 million to 650 million barrels. The peak outputwill be about 110,000 barrels a day.   Epp was joined in the announcement by International TradeMinister John Crosbie, Premier Clyde Wells, provincial EnergyMinister Rex Gibbons and several other officials.   The announcement ends weeks of speculation about the agreement.   The underwater oil reserve was discovered a decade ago about 190miles southeast of St. John's. Years of negotiations followed overissues such as the split in development costs and amount ofbenefits to go to Newfoundland.   A tentative agreement was reached in 1988. Since then, threedeadlines for a formal go-ahead have passed.   Mobil's redesign last year of the topside sections of theHibernia production platform - which will house productionfacilities and living quarters above the water - contributed to thedelay.   Also, the federal government promised the consortium - whichincludes Gulf Canada Resources, Chevron Canada Resources andPetro-Canada - $2.7 billion ($2.3 billion U.S.) Canadian in cashand loan guarantees.   But a bill authorizing Ottawa's contribution was pulled in lateJune after the collapse of a constitutional accord that stirredcontroversy across Canada over recognition of Quebec's FrenchCanadians as a distinct society.   Wells cancelled a vote on the accord in the Newfoundlandlegislature, and Conservative Parliament members from Quebec arebelieved to have threatened to vote against the bill in retaliationfor Wells's action.   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's absence from the announcementtoday has fueled speculation that tensions are still high.</TEXT></DOC>
