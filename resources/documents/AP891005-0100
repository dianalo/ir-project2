Richard G. Darman, director of the White House Office ofManagement and Budget, said the administration-supportedcapital-gains cut approved by the House last week is flawed becauseits full impact would be in effect for only 27 months.   Nevertheless, Darman said under questioning by the SenateGovernmental Affairs Committee, the House plan is ``better thannone at all because we could extend it.'' That is what theadministration hopes to do in the Senate, he added.   Sen. Bob Packwood of Oregon, senior Republican on thetax-writing Finance Committee, said he is trying to put together acapital-gains cut that can get the support of Democrats andRepublicans.   ``I believe there is a significant number of senators, bothDemocrats and Republicans, who are interested in supporting sometype of capital-gains proposal,'' Packwood said in a statement.   The Finance Committee earlier this week defeated on a 10-10 votea Packwood proposal that would have cut capital-gains taxes forindividuals and corporations.   Thus, the deficit-reduction bill written by the committeecontains no capital-gains cut but a substitute favored by mostDemocrats that would attempt to encourage increased saving byliberalizing tax-deductible Individual Retirement Accounts.   The Senate will begin debate on the bill as early as Friday.   Under the law that governs consideration of suchdeficit-reduction bills, some congressional aides say, it willrequire 60 votes _ not just a majority of the senators voting _ toadd a capital-gains cut to the bill on the Senate floor.Republicans are challenging that interpretation.   Bush won the votes of all but one Republican and of one of everyfour Democrats when the House approved a cpaital-gains reductionlast week. But that was not a straight yes-or-no vote on capitalgains, because the alternative was to vote for a tax increase onhigh-income Americans to finance liberalized IRAs.   Senate Democratic leaders are pushing the same IRA provision butare steering clear of anything that could be interpreted as a taxincrease.   The Packwood proposal that failed in the Finance Committee, andwhich is likely to be the basis of any plan presented to theSenate, would provide a lower tax on stocks, land and otherinvestments that are held for longer periods of time by individuals.   For example, if an investment is sold after being owned only ayear and a day, 95 percent of the profit from the sale would betaxed. But if the investment were held for six years, only 70percent would be taxed.   Present law fully taxes capital gains at the same rates applyingto wages and other income.   Democratic leaders are fighting a capital-gains cut on groundsthat 80 percent of the tax saving would go to people with annualincomes over $100,000. They say allowing more workers to havetax-deductible IRAs would be more effective in encouraging saving.   Present law authorizes fully deductible IRAs only for workerswho are not covered by a company pension, to covered single peoplewith incomes under $25,000 and covered couples under $40,000.   The Democratic proposal would allow any worker, regardless ofincome or company pension, to deduct half of an annual contributionof up to $2,000. Half of a contribution would be taxed at thecurrent rate and the other half, along with interest earned by theaccount, would escape tax until withdrawn for retirement, to buy afirst home or pay for a college education.</TEXT></DOC>
