As a result, the central feature of shifting cultivation,the exploitation of the natural vegetation-soil complex as a substitutefor human labor, has been ignored. The omission of the biomass contributioncan be attributed to both a focus on the practices involved rather thanthe underlying strategy of the shifting cultivator, and an excessivepreoccupation with the renewability of the energy sources involved indifferent agricultural systems. A definition of shifting cultivationis proposed that focuses attention on the relationship between the naturalvegetation-soil complex and the shifting cultivator. Two methods of includingthe energy contribution of forest biomass in calculating the productivityof shifting cultivation systems are compared. When the biomass contributionis included, shifting cultivation appears to be an extremely unproductivesystem of agriculture.</TEXT></DOC>
