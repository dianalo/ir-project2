Traders and analysts cited technical factors and aperception among some market participants that the world oilglut is fading.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Technically, the market has been basing for a rally, andthere are a lot of prevailing circumstances moving ithigher,&quot; said Shahrokh Nikkhah, executive vice president ofRefco Inc., New York.   In futures trading, however, crude oil wasn't able tobreak out of a recent trading pattern of $19 to $20 a barrel,although it ended the day at the upper end of the range.   In late trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, crudefor May delivery briefly broke through the psychologicallyimportant level of $20 a barrel. It then settled at $19.98 abarrel, up 51 cents for the day. The June crude contractincreased 47 cents to $19.86 a barrel.   Several petroleum refiners raised their field postings forWest Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark crude, by 50cents to $18.75 a barrel.   The rise in crude futures was strong enough to spark alate rally in Europe. On London's International Petroleumexchange, the Brent blend crude for May delivery closed 62cents higher at $18.73 a barrel. Spot prices for the NorthSea crude finished 30 cents to 50 cents a barrel higher.   Still, European traders noted that news of cuts in SaudiArabia's crude oil contract prices for May delivery shouldhave helped undermine prices.   Peter Gignoux, manager of the international energy desk inLondon for Shearson Lehman Brothers, is among those who arebearish despite yesterday's rise in prices. He said&quot;reasonably aggressive&quot; pricing by Saudi Arabia and Iran islikely to keep prices under pressure. He said production bythe Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries apparentlycontinues to exceed 23 million barrels a day despite arrivalof the second quarter, usually a slack period for oil demand.Also, he added, &quot;we've got a situation in Europe where thestorage tanks are quite full.&quot;   But Refco's Mr. Nikkhah suggested the fundamentals arebullish. He cited the decline in the Soviet Union's oilexports, a general feeling that the problems in the MiddleEast could escalate again and the belief that OPEC's leadingproducers of Saudi Arabia and Iran have &quot;a gentlemen'sagreement&quot; to hold oil prices in a range that would maintainWest Texas Intermediate up around $21 a barrel.   &quot;I'm looking for WTI to go to $22.75 or $23 in the nextsix to eight weeks,&quot; Mr. Nikkhah said.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: Prices of most hog futures contractsdropped amid an increased supply of hogs ready for slaughter.According to Jerry Abbenhaus, a livestock analyst at A.G.Edwards andamp; Sons, St. Louis, meatpackers were able to killabout 325,000 hogs yesterday compared with 192,000 hogsMonday. Pork production usually drops around the Easterholiday, as some plants close for the holiday and consumerdemand drops. Forecasts for an increase in the number ofcattle available for meatpackers caused prices of most cattlefutures contracts to slip from record levels. Cattle pricesare high because of a tight supply of fattened livestock.                                                                                                          COFFEE: Prices fell on nervous expectations for anannouncement late today by Brazil about its export policy.Coffee for May delivery ended 1.40 cents a pound lower at92.65 cents. Brazil is expected to announce the reopening ofexport registrations for new coffee sales and possiblyprovide information about its investigation into allegationsof insider trading, analysts said. Brazil suspended exportregistrations on March 21 while the country considered areturn to an international coffee price support agreement.Export registrations and futures volume surged in the daysbefore the announcement, triggering a call for aninvestigation into insider trading. Futures traders hadexpected Brazil to reopen exports soon, the analysts said, soif the action is taken prices probably won't movesignificantly. What would affect the market is a decision byBrazil to call for a meeting of the International CoffeeOrganization to push for an international agreement, saidCeleste Georgakis, senior analyst at Cargill InvestorServices. She also said that it's too soon for results of theinsider trading investigation to be available. Selling basedon technical factors also contributed to the price fall, saidDario Sarmiento, director of Sarmiento Group, a Miamiconsulting firm.                                                                                                          COTTON: Futures prices rallied. Cotton for May deliveryfinished 0.41 cent a pound higher at 84.49 cents. Nextseason's cotton traded at life-of-contract highs as millsbought contracts to fix prices on purchases, said ThomasMueller, an analyst with Merrill Lynch. After setting alife-of-contract high of 69.60 cents, December cottonretreated somewhat to end 0.05 cent higher at 69.20 cents.July 1992 cotton also set a new high, while March 1992 andMay 1992 matched old highs. But in recent days rallies innew-crop futures have met with significant selling by hedgersseeking to lock in current high prices, Mr. Mueller said. Itwill take major bullish news for December cotton to remainabove the 69.50 cents level, he said. So far, plantingsappear to be going well; and, with prices near 70 cents,bankers are beginning to consider granting more credit tofarmers, Mr. Mueller said. In the past few days, he added, hehas received numerous calls from bankers inquiring about hiscotton outlook. Tight credit had caused concerns earlier thatfarmers wouldn't be able to plant as many acres as theywanted. Dean Ethridge, economist with Sparks Commodities ofMemphis, Tenn., said traders are also still reacting to theMarch 28 planting intentions report from the AgricultureDepartment that showed a sizable reduction in cotton acreagefrom earlier estimates. Also, he said, indications are thatdemand is still strong. He expects December cotton to tradein a range of 68 cents to 73 cents for several weeks.</TEXT></DOC>
