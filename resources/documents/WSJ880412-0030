The Ocala, Fla., maker of wire shelving blamed the results on a decrease in profit margins, higher than expected product development costs for new products and overly optimistic estimates of revenue and profits by operating divisions.    The company didn't provide any specific profit estimates for the year.    Clairson said that orders for its Closet Maid storage systems and Clairson storage and display products remain &quot;very strong.&quot;    The company said second-quarter and six-month sales of Clairson products rose more than 40% from the year-earlier periods when it reported sales of $18.9 million and $35.2 million, respectively. </TEXT></DOC>
