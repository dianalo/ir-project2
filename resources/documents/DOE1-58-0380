Together with the Anger camera, thedigital computer has been instrumental in the development of the field.The computer began its career as a research tool, but it has evolvedinto an integral part of daily clinical practice. In this chapter theauthors look at the computer and some of the ways in which the computercan be used to process gastrointestinal scintigrams. The impact whichthe computer has had in gastrointestinal nuclear medicine has been lessdramatic than in other areas, such as cardiovascular studies. Many ofthe hopes of improved diagnostic utility through image processing havenot been fulfilled. The reasons for this failure are discussed. Someaspects of data and image acquisition are also discussed, although theseare not specific to gastrointestinal nuclear medicine.</TEXT></DOC>
