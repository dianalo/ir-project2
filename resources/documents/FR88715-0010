Regulatory History</ITAG>In the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of December 5, 1986 (51 FR 43877), FDA publisheda final rule permanently listing Dandamp;C Red No. 8 and Dandamp;C Red No.9 for use in ingested drug and cosmetic lip products and in externallyapplied drugs and cosmetics. In that final rule FDA concluded that, althoughavailable studies establish that Dandamp;C Red No. 9 and, by implication,Dandamp;C Red No. 8 are carcinogens when ingested by laboratory animals,quantitative risk assessments of the color additives indicate that therisk of human cancer from use of these color additives in ingested drugand cosmetic lip products, and in externally applied drugs and cosmetics,would be extremely low and that there would be no benefit to the publichealth from prohibiting these uses of the color additives. FDA concludedthat the use of Dandamp;C Red No. 8 and Dandamp;C Red No. 9 were safe underthe conditions prescribed in the regulations permanently listing the coloradditives.FDA also concluded in the December 5, 1986, final rule that it was appropriateto apply <T3>de minimis</T3> exceptions to the Delaney clause of the Color AdditiveAmendments of 1960 (the amendments) to the act because any risk of cancerthat the color additives may present is of no public health consequence.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Comments and Objections</ITAG>In response to the December 5, 1986, final rule, the Public Citizen LitigationGroup (Public Citizen) and others filed objections to the listing of Dandamp;CRed Nos. 8 and 9. These objections stayed the effective date of the finalregulations. Additionally, the Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association,Inc. (CTFA), submitted comments to FDA in support of the agency's actions.Neither group requested a hearing.FDA, in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of June 5, 1987 (52 FR 21302), responded to theobjections. In that document, FDA modified several aspects of the manufacturingprocess for Dandamp;C Red No. 9, and established a new effective date forthe permanent listing of Dandamp;C Red Nos. 8 and 9. This rule also establisheda new effective date for the revised new manufacturing process for Dandamp;CRed No. 9, incorporated FDA's explanation of its interpretations of theDelaney clause that had been published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of February 19, 1987, and reaffirmed the agency'sconclusions as to the safety of the two color additives.On July 31, 1987, FDA confirmed the effective date of the rule revisingthe manufacturing process for Dandamp;C Red No. 9.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Legal Action</ITAG>On August 3, 1987, Public Citizen filed suit in the U.S. Court of Appealsfor the Third Circuit of Philadelphia, seeking to overturn FDA's decisionto permanently list Dandamp;C Red Nos. 8 and 9. However, before a decisionwas reached by that Court, the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington, DCissued a decision relating to Dandamp;C Red No. 19 and Dandamp;C Orange No.17 and holding that ``the Delaney clause of Color Additive Amendments doesnot contain an implicit <T3>de minimis</T3> exception for carcinogens with trivial risk to humans,''and that the listing of carcinogenic color additives is contrary to law.Following this decision, CTFA, an intervenor in the D.C. Circuit case,petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to grant a writ of certiorari on thedecision. On April 28, 1988, the Supreme Court denied certiorari. The agency,on May 26, 1988, asked the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit to remandthe case on Dandamp;C Red Nos. 8 and 9 to the agency so that it could revokethe listings of these colors because of the D.C. Circuit's decision, involvingthe same issues, on Dandamp;C Red No. 19 and Dandamp;C Orange No. 17. Dandamp;CRes Nos. 8 and 9 had been permanently listed based upon legal reasoningidentical to that used to permanently list Dandamp;C Red No. 19 and Dandamp;COrange No. 17. Subsequently, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuitgranted the agency's request and remanded to FDA the decision in Dandamp;CRed Nos. 8 and 9.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. FDA Action</ITAG>In reaching its decision regarding the action to be taken on Dandamp;C RedNo. 8 and Dandamp;C Red No. 9, FDA has considered the D.C. Circuit's decisionon Dandamp;C Red No. 19 and Dandamp;C Orange 17 that the Delaney clause barsthe permanent listing of any color additive that has been shown to inducecancer. FDA has found that Dandamp;C Red No. 9, and, by implication, Dandamp;CRed No. 8, induce cancer in laboratory test animals. There have been noadditional data submitted to FDA that would contravene the agency's previousfindings. The carcinogenicity of Dandamp;C Red No. 9 and other data relevantto the safety of the two additives were discussed in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> in documents published on December 5, 1986 (51FR 43877), June 5, 1987 (52 FR 21302), and July 31, 1987 (52 FR 28552).<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Conclusions</ITAG>FDA has previously concluded that Dandamp;C Red No. 9 induces cancer in testanimals, that Dandamp;C Red No. 8 is toxicologically equivalent to Dandamp;CRed No. 9, and that therefore the results of toxicity and carcinogenicitystudies of Dandamp;C Red No. 9 apply to both additives. No new data or informationhave been submitted to FDA on this issue. On the basis of the finding ofcarcinogenicity and the D.C. Circuit Court's decision on Dandamp;C Red No.19 and Dandamp;C Orange No. 17 that there is no <T3>de minimis</T3> exception to the Delaney clause for color additives,FDA concludes that the regulations permanently listing Dandamp;C Red Nos.8 and 9 are contrary to law and without legal effect. Moreover, in lightof the Court's ruling, the carcinogenicity of the color additives, andthe congressional concern as expressed in the Delaney clause about thesafety of color additives found to be carcinogens, the agency concludesthat not only is there no legal basis upon which to permit the permanentlisting of the color additives, but also no basis to put them back on theprovisional list (Pub. L. 86-618, section 203(a)). Thus, in the regulationsset forth below, the agency is removing those color additive regulationswhich permanently listed Dandamp;C Red No. 8 and Dandamp;C Red No. 9, and removingthe regulations that provide for the provisional use of the lakes of thecolor additives.Consistent with the revocation regulations, all certificates heretoforeissued for both Dandamp;C Red No. 8 and Dandamp;C Red No. 9, their lakes, andall mixtures containing these color additives for ingested drug and cosmeticlip products and for externally applied drug and cosmetic uses are cancelledas of July 15, 1988. After this date, the addition of Dandamp;C Red No. 8or Dandamp;C Red No. 9 to drugs or cosmetics will cause such products tobe adulterated within the meaning of sections 501 and 601 of the act (21U.S.C. 351 and 361) and to be subject to regulatory action. This prohibitionapplies to the use of the straight color additives, their lakes, and mixturesof the color additives and their lakes. Elsewhere in this issue of the<T4>Federal Register</T4>, FDA is publishing a notice denying the coloradditive petition for these two color additives.FDA also concludes that the health concern regarding the use of these coloradditives does not represent an acute, imminent hazard. Therefore, theprotection of the public health does not require: (1) Recall from the marketof drug and cosmetic products for external use that contain either coloradditive, or (2) the destruction of such drug or cosmetic products to whicheither color has already been added.Manufacturers of new drugs and new animal drugs (including certifiableantibiotics for animal use) that contain Dandamp;C Red No. 8 or Dandamp;C RedNo. 9 may either discontinue use of the color additives or substitute differentcolor additives in accordance with the provisions of 21 CFR 314.70(b)(2)(i)and (d)(4) or 21 CFR 514.8(d)(3) and (e), as appropriate. If a substitutecolor additive is not used, the human drug manufacturer shall describethe change fully in the next annual report as required under andSection;314.81(b)(2)(iv)(<T3>b</T3>). If a substitute color additive is used, the manufacturer shallfile with FDA a supplemental new drug application or a supplemental newanimal drug application containing data describing the new compositionand showing that the change is composition does not interfere with anyassay or other control procedures used in manufacturing the drug, or thatthe assay and control procedures have been revised to make them adequate.The applicant shall also submit data available to establish the stabilityof the revised formulation. If the data are too limited to support a conclusionthat the drug will retain its declared potency for a reasonable marketingperiod, the applicant shall submit a commitment to test the stability ofmarketed batches at reasonable intervals, to submit to FDA those data asthey become available, and to recall from the market any batch found tofall outside the approved specifications for the drug.Each sponsor of a notice of claimed investigational exemption for a newdrug (IND) or a notice of claimed investigational exemption for a new animaldrug (INAD) containing Dandamp;C Red No.8 or Dandamp;C Red No. 9 should promptlyamend the IND or INAD to indicate that the color additives have been deletedor a different color additive substituted.FDA is aware that supplies of alternative color additives and labelingmay be difficult to obtain immediately. Consequently, drug and cosmeticlabeling that states that the product contains ``artificial color'' orthat specifically identifies Dandamp;C Red No. 8 and Dandamp;C Red No. 9 maycontinue to be used with the uncolored product or product containing alternativecolor additives during the time necessary to obtain supplies of revisedlabeling or until July 17, 1989, whichever comes first.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Economic and Environmental Impacts</ITAG>Executive Order 12291 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354)do not apply to actions of this type.The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effectsof this action. FDA has concluded that the action will not have a significantimpact on the human environment and that an environmental impact statementis not required. A copy of the FDA environmental assessment is on filewith the Dockets Management Branch (address above).<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>21 CFR Part 74  Color additives, Cosmetics, Drugs, Medical devices. 21 CFR Part 81  Color additives, Cosmetics, Drugs.21 CFR Part 82  Color additives, Color additives lakes, Cosmetics, Drugs.Therefore, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and under authoritydelegated to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, Parts 74, 81, and 82 areamended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 74_LISTING OF COLOR ADDITIVES SUBJECT TO CERTIFICATION </ITAG>1.
