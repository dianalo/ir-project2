A panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District ofColumbia on Friday reversed a lower court's ruling that students in18 states lacked legal standing to bring the case to speed updesegregation of public schools and state colleges.   On the basis of his 1987 ruling, U.S. District Judge John H.Pratt had dissolved two 1983 orders that set timetables for theEducation Department's review of desegregation plans submitted bystates for public schools and universities.   In Friday's ruling, a three-judge panel held the plaintiffs had a``direct stake in the effective enforcement of anti-discriminationlaws'' because they were enrolled in schools, colleges oruniversities ``that engaged in proscribed discrimination.''   ``Plaintiffs in this action, beyond question, are the intendedbeneficiaries of the statutes under which they sue'' and could provea direct harm if the laws are not enforced, the panel ruled in anopinion by Judge Ruth B. Ginsburg.   While the court did not issue a final judgment in the casepending resolution of other significant legal issues, the decisionwas hailed by the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, Inc., asan important step toward reviving the case.   ``It's very crucial that the courts have upheld our right to sueunder these civil rights statutes,'' said Janell M. Byrd, anattorney for the New York-based organization.   ``Judge Pratt's ruling would have closed the door not only onthis litigation, it would make it very difficult to sue the federalgovernment for failure to enforce a statute,'' she said.   The suit, which dates back to the Nixon administration, producedcourt decisions by Pratt ordering the government to revoke federalaid to segregated schools and universities under the 1964 CivilRights Act.   It resulted in a series of court orders and a 1977 consent decreeunder which the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, andlater the Department of Education, were given timetables forreviewing discrimination complaints and later plans for ending thelast vestiges of segregation.   The Reagan administration sought in 1982 to dissolve the 1977consent decree, saying it could not be legally bound by an agreemententered into by the Carter administration.   That issue is now before the appeals court along with severalothers that remain as legal hurdles for civil rights lawyers seekingto revive the case.   The case involved enforcement of desegregation laws againstschools and universities in Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida,Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, NorthCarolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Virginia,West Virginia, and Texas.</TEXT></DOC>
