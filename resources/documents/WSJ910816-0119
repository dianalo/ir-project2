Pate said in an interview.   Since early 1990 Pennzoil had tried to sell Purolator, thebiggest maker of auto filters in the U.S., but has sinceinstalled new management that it believes has turned thecompany around. Wall Street was expecting a sale, but Mr.Pate said Pennzoil will now hold on to Purolator. It has gonefrom requiring $42 million of cash infusions from Pennzoil togenerating cash for the company in the past year.</LP><TEXT>   Pennzoil as long as five years ago talked aboutreorganizing after it split the company into basic businessgroups: oil and gas, motor oil, and sulfur. But seniormanagement first spent all its time on Pennzoil's legalbattle with Texaco Inc. and then trying to figure out how tospend its spoils of $2.6 billion. With most of the moneyinvested in Chevron Corp. stock, attention returned to therestructuring.   Mr. Pate wouldn't provide specific details on how it willunwind. &quot;The timing of the restructuring and its form will bevery dependent on market conditions,&quot; he said. Tapping aneight-inch stack of folders on his desk, he added, &quot;We'veevaluated our options completely.&quot; He said he expects&quot;significant changes&quot; over the next 12 to 18 months but stepscould be taken sooner.   As an example, he said the oil and gas company could bepart of the restructuring but suggested that with natural gasprices the lowest in more than 10 years it would make nosense to begin a move today.   Earlier this summer analysts valued the oil and gascompany at about $1.7 billion. They valued the motor oilsubsidiary at $900 million to $1.1 billion and the sulfuroperations at $550 to $600 million. The Chevron shares atcurrent prices are valued at about $2.4 billion.   Contrary to many Wall Street expectations that includerapid spinoffs of subsidiaries and asset sales, Mr. Pate saidit's more likely to occur in stages. &quot;There probably won't bea big bang with the pieces flying all at once,&quot; he said. Hedid say that reducing debt will be a &quot;guiding principle&quot; ofany plan.   In addition, there will be a surviving entity. &quot;Underalmost any scenario there will be a Pennzoil,&quot; Mr. Pate said.After making changes at Purolator and elsewhere withinPennzoil, Mr. Pate said, he expects and wants to stay in thejob, which he has held since March 1990.   That's something his immediate predecessors haven't beenable to do for very long in the shadow of J. Hugh Liedtke,Pennzoil's 69-year-old chairman and modern-day founder. Mr.Liedtke and his longtime associate Baine P. Kerr, 71,currently a Pennzoil director and a former president,continue to be heavily involved in strategic planning,including the restructuring.   Pennzoil has spun off or divested itself of businessesbefore that now trade independently under such names asBattle Mountain Gold Co., Pogo Producing Co., and ZapataCorp. Messrs. Liedtke and Kerr have made the decisions foralmost all of Pennzoil's major activities for years. But Mr.Pate said they now leave operations to him.   His most visible change has been the apparent turnaroundat Purolator, which has climbed into the black after a longperiod of losses. &quot;It's really significant given the nationalrecession,&quot; he said.   Mr. Pate, 55, put in new managers with manufacturingexperience in June 1990, sold some small businesses and cutemployment to 3,500 from 4,624 persons. He also changedPurolator's goal of gaining market share through discounts.He renegotiated several contracts, obtaining higher prices.&quot;We're not taking any and all business anymore,&quot; he said.Sales growth has slowed but profit margins are wider.   Pennzoil will switch the status of Purolator, which alsomakes filters for commercial and industrial use, to acontinuing subsidiary from a discontinued operation. Asrecently as a month ago Pennzoil received a bid to buyPurolator but spurned it, Mr. Pate said. &quot;I wouldn't evenentertain an offer,&quot; he said, adding, &quot;We've decided to keepit.&quot;   Pennzoil bought Purolator in May 1988 for $250 million andwound up investing another $100 million. &quot;We obviously paidtoo much,&quot; Mr. Pate said. The company was written down toabout $215 million.</TEXT></DOC>
