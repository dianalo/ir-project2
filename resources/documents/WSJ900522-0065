Hewas right, the U.S. seems to have made all the concessions.It's too bad he didn't get anything for them.   In particular, Mr. Baker came back with nothing onconventional arms in Europe; White House national securityadviser Brent Scowcroft declared Saturday that the Soviets&quot;are now stonewalling&quot; the whole issue. So not a word aboutthose 40,000 Soviet tanks. Nothing on the 380,000 Red Armytroops in East Germany, soon to be part of West Germany. Yetthe removal of those forces and destruction of the armamentswere supposed to be the major goals of U.S. policy.</LP><TEXT>   Rolling the Red Army out of Eastern Europe was supposed tobe the historic achievement to redeem official Americansilence about Lithuania. The Moscow preliminaries seem togive Mr. Gorbachev a blank check to keep cranking up the heaton Lithuania and the other Baltics. And the Russians cancontinue to insist, as they did to Mr. Baker, that a unitedGermany can never, ever be part of NATO, despite the clearwishes of even most East Germans.   For his part, George Bush seems uncertain about Mr.Baker's claim of &quot;real accomplishments.&quot; At first onSaturday, the President gave the results in Moscow &quot;a mixedreview,&quot; but since then has called it &quot;a major step forward.&quot;Maybe his opinion will change again after he sees the fineprint. He has to remember that the details will bescrutinized by the Democratic Senate, perhaps one looking forits chance to get to his right on foreign policy.   Laying aside the geopolitical stakes in Eastern Europe,the big U.S. objective in START has been to limit thefirst-strike potential of the huge Soviet land-based missileforce. Under the Baker deal, the Soviets agree to cut by halfthe number of their huge SS-18 missiles, each of which has 10highly accurate warheads. But the U.S. has dropped itsearlier demand that the Soviets not test the 154 remainingmissiles; this means it can and will modernize the force tomake up for what it lost. Meanwhile, the Soviets have alsorefused any limits on SS-24s and SS-25s, theirimpossible-to-verify land-based mobile missiles. The U.S. hasno land-based mobile missiles -- none. The Sovietfirst-strike advantage remains intact.   Meanwhile, the American advantage in high-tech cruisemissiles has been badly eroded. This is our best newdefensive weapon, highly accurate; when armed withconventional warheads it can destroy invading tanks withoutblowing up everything nearby. The U.S. agreed to the Sovietdemand for a range limit of 375 miles on air-launchedcruises, so they'll no longer be available for long-rangemissions.   Mr. Baker also agreed to limit sea-launched cruises in aside-letter said to be &quot;nonbinding.&quot; But when was a U.S.arms-control promise ever &quot;nonbinding?&quot; The U.S. is stillabiding by SALT II a decade after the Senate refused toratify it. The deal does allow 880 sea-launched cruises, morethan the Navy currently intends to deploy, and there issupposed to be some special treatment for a new non-nuclearcruise missile known as &quot;Tacit Rainbow.&quot; But experience warnsthat when arms control targets a class of weapons it erodesthe economics, and the budget process moves in for the kill.Putting sea-cruises into a side agreement withoutverification clearly means that the U.S. will be limited, butthe Soviets won't.   Meanwhile, the Backfire bomber, an issue that hasbedeviled all arms talks for years, is described as a&quot;detail&quot; to be worked out. Along with the SS-18 and mobilemissiles. This is silly.   The chemical-arms accord isn't any more reassuring. Tobegin with, how do we know the size of the chemicalstockpiles the Russians are supposed to cut? And how can wetake their word on a new treaty, when they're still sayingthe mysterious explosion and murderous outbreak of anthrax atSverdlovsk in 1979 was caused by contaminated meat? DidSecretary Baker renounce the longstanding U.S. position thatSverdlovsk was an arms-plant accident showing that theSoviets violated an existing treaty calling for destructionof biological weapons, just as the new treaty calls fordestruction of chemical weapons?   What the U.S. gets for these concessions, apparently, is afeeling of reassurance that Mikhail Gorbachev will continueto hold power in the Soviet Union. His economy's a shambles.His former allies in East Europe want his troops out. Mr.Gorbachev is the one who should be dying to make theconcessions; instead he seems to own the Bush administration.The U.S. is committed to him not only regardless of hispolicy in the Baltics, but also regardless of the strategicbalance.   President Bush no doubt wants a pleasant summit with Mr.Gorbachev next week, but in fact no treaty has been concludedso far. And as President Bush ponders what his Secretary ofState brought back from Moscow, he should also reflect on thefates of presidents who too eagerly signed arms accords inthe 1970s. If Jimmy Carter signed this deal, he'd be hootedout of town.</TEXT></DOC>
