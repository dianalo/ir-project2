Cohen (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> STK SCR </IN><G> SEC JUS </G><TEXT>   Lawyers for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and other defendants in the Securities and Exchange Commission's complaint plan a slashing defense in which they will attempt to compel testimony from Ivan Boesky and others who provided information to the government.    The lawyers said yesterday that the SEC complaint alleging insider trading and other securities-law violations would be proved specious during the pre-trial fact-finding process known as discovery and wouldn't stand up in court.    They also said the SEC's decision to go forward with its civil complaint without waiting for accompanying criminal charges from the U.S. attorney's office could give the defendants a chance to gather potent evidence to fight any such charges.    Martin Flumenbaum, an attorney for defendant Michael Milken, said, &quot;The complaint is based almost entirely on the false accusations of Ivan Boesky.&quot; He added, &quot;It is obvious that Mr. Boesky was motivated to lie and make false accusations.&quot;    &quot;They have had two years with the full power of the government to look into the matter,&quot; said an attorney for another of the defendants. &quot;Now, under the rules of discovery, we are going to have a chance to look into a few things.&quot;    Although the SEC said the timing of its action &quot;doesn't mean anything,&quot; a number of lawyers close to the case said they were shocked that the SEC filed its civil suit before waiting for U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani to file the long-rumored criminal charges.    &quot;We can't infer that there won't be a criminal case,&quot; said Andrew M. Lawler Jr., an attorney for defendant Pamela R. Monzert. But, Mr. Lawler said, &quot;Usually there's some coordination&quot; between the SEC and the U.S. attorney's office, and there wasn't in this case.    Mr. Lawler said that &quot;you can reasonably anticipate that we will defend this case aggressively.&quot; He said that the attorneys will probably move quickly to get depositions from a number of individuals, including Mr. Boesky. He said, however, that in civil cases already pending in which Mr. Boesky is a defendant, &quot;The U.S. attorney has gone into court to request that depositions be stayed,&quot; and that that may happen in this case, too. If depositions are stayed, the SEC's case could not proceed.    Other attorneys with knowledge of the case speculated there may have been a dispute between the U.S. attorney's office and the SEC over when the charges should be brought, but they offered no evidence. The attorneys for defendants said they didn't learn of the SEC charges until late yesterday.    Said one lawyer close to the case, &quot;We expected the civil and criminal charges to be filed simultaneously.&quot; The attorney said that as far as he knew, the U.S. attorney's office wasn't yet prepared to bring charges relating to Drexel.    However, this isn't the first time that the SEC filed a civil action before criminal charges were brought in an insider trading case. In May 1986, the SEC filed a civil action against Dennis B. Levine, then a managing director of Drexel, alleging that he traded in 54 securities while in possession of inside information.    Mr. Levine later agreed to disgorge about $11.5 million of his illegal profits and pleaded guilty to four criminal charges, including securities and tax fraud.    Thus far, in civil suits involving Mr. Boesky, the U.S. attorney has taken the position that Mr. Boesky shouldn't be compelled to give testimony until the government completes all criminal investigations in which Mr. Boesky is an informant.    In the Boesky civil suits, the U.S. attorney successfully petitioned Judge Milton Pollack, who will also preside over the SEC case against Drexel, to delay most discovery.    Stanley Arkin, a New York defense attorney who has represented other defendants against insider-trading charges, criticized the SEC's &quot;inequity&quot; in proceeding with civil charges &quot;of serious misconduct knowing that the U.S. attorney will block them&quot; from taking depositions.    Added Thomas Puccio, a former government prosecutor who is now a defense lawyer, &quot;This is a complete departure from normal procedure.&quot; Mr. Puccio said the bringing of civil charges &quot;creates all kinds of problems for&quot; pressing a criminal case. &quot;If I were the prosecutor, I would be very unhappy,&quot; he said.    Attorneys noted that the SEC will only have to prove its civil charges by a preponderance of the evidence -- in other words, that the allegations are more likely true than false. In a criminal case, the government would have to prove its allegations beyond a reasonable doubt, a standard that would provide a much tougher test of the evidence.    If the government does not file criminal charges, said one attorney, that might mean that &quot;they may not have as strong a case.&quot; He added, &quot;That may explain why Drexel has not settled&quot; the case.    Attorneys for the defendants declined to elaborate on their strategy, beyond affirming their plans to move quickly to get depositions from potential witnesses. But other attorneys said that they believed that the lawyers representing Drexel and the others were likely to argue that what their clients did was reasonable.    In the areas of insider trading and manipulation, Mr. Puccio said, &quot;Definitions of these violations haven't been laid out so well that there isn't room for plenty of argument.&quot; He said that in each case, attorneys are likely to argue that their clients weren't insiders, or that what they did was reasonable.    The multitude of charges and the number of defendants in the SEC's case makes the case more complicated than insider trading cases that have come before, attorneys say. For one thing, each individual has the right to conduct his own discovery in the case. But attorneys for most of the defendants have been working together to prepare for charges for nearly two years and are likely to continue to cooperate with each other. </TEXT></DOC>
