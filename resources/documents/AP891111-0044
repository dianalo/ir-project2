Several dozen students and police were injured, mostly by flyingrocks. Police said they had no precise figures on injuries or anyfigures on arrests.   The police poured into Korea University in eastern Seoul as sixarmored vans with tear gas launchers fired volleys of choking gas.   Students counterattacked with firebombs and rocks, and the twosides fought for more than five hours in clashes around the hugecampus.   Police moved into the campus to stop about 1,000 students anddissidents from holding a rally to call for the overthrow of theRoh government.   Hundreds of riot police had surrounded the campus during thenight. Police stopped and questioned students trying to enter, andsome were taken away for questioning.   The attack on the campus was unusual, since police normally donot attempt to halt protests inside school grounds. But policecommanders have been ordered to take tough measures to crack downon anti-government radicals.   Also today, about 1,000 riot police were stationed aroundDongkuk University in central Seoul to prevent students fromassembling there for a rally.   The government also banned a rally planned for Sunday bymilitant labor unions calling for better pay and working conditionsfor industrial workers. National Police headquarters said the rallyposed a threat to ``social order.''   Labor leaders said they would try to hold the rally anyway.   The strength of the radical student movement and allieddissident groups has declined in recent months because of theirgrowing extremism and violent tactics.   The radicals are not considered to be a serious threat to thegovernment. However, the Roh administration insists they threatennational security.</TEXT></DOC>
