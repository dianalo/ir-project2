The federal suit also alleges that a deal to sell strugglingThomson McKinnon this year fell through after buyer Prudential-BacheSecurities Inc. discovered the brokerage was overvalued by $80million to $95 million.   After the deal collapsed, Prudential-Bache in July purchased onlyThomson McKinnon's retail brokerage offices and customer accounts.   The company denied the allegations in the lawsuit, filed by 16current and former Thomson McKinnon employees in U.S. District Courtin Manhattan as a class action on behalf of an estimated 2,800employees who owned stock in the firm, which traces its formation to1885.   The lawsuit claims Thomson McKinnon executives used assets in anemployee stock ownership plan, or ESOP, in ``a well planned andexecuted scheme to personally profit at the expense of'' the firm,its subsidiaries and the ESOP.   Thomson McKinnon allegedly kept apartments in Puerto Rico andManhattan for senior officers; bought and maintained a $1.3 millionyacht for the company's president; gave executives disguised weeklycash payments for personal use; and paid school tuition for formerchairman John J. Maloney Jr.'s 13 children.   The lawsuit alleges broad financial mismanagement, including a$125 million loan to a real estate investment trust that wentbankrupt and a costly decision to move the company's offices shortlyafter the 1987 stock market crash.   The firm also regularly overstated the company's earnings andassets to induce employees to buy into the ESOP, the lawsuit claims.The financial mismanagement, it alleges, led to the collapsed dealwith Prudential-Bache.   Donald G. McCabe, general counsel for Thomson McKinnon SecuritiesInc., the firm's brokerage arm, said the defendants ``will mostfirmly deny the allegations'' and that the lawsuit is ``withoutmerit.''   He declined immediate comment on specific allegations in the suit.   The lawsuit says employees held about 77 percent of the stock instock in Thomson McKinnon as part of their regular compensation andthe ESOP was worth about $140 million in 1986.   A year later it was estimated at $125 million, the plaintiffsclaim, but on July 31 this year the employees received a letter fromThomson McKinnon Chairman J. Ronald Morgan stating that ``it ispossible (the ESOP) will have no value whatsoever.''   The letter, distributed after the deal for the brokeragedivision, also stated the ESOP would be canceled because the sale ofthe full company to Prudential-Bache had fallen through.   The lawsuit claims employees would have received the cashequivalent of the stock following a sale, but lost that money whenthe deal fell through because of the alleged mismanagement.   The suit seeks more than $100 million in damages, or the amountin the ESOP allegedly dissipated by executive mismanagement.   In addition to Thomson McKinnon, Morgan and Maloney, the lawsuitnames company chairman Philip M. Fahey, six other senior executivesand the accounting firm Coopers andamp; Lybrand.</TEXT></DOC>
