MillerStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 03/19/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> MERSTOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR)SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) </IN><TEXT>   Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. said it is investigating loans of more than $1 million made by its London banking unit to a member of an investor group that included Israeli financier David Sofer, who was accused by the U.S. government last week of being a central figure in a massive insider-trading scheme.    Merrill Lynch said it is seeking to determine whether the loans are linked to the alleged insider trading by Mr. Sofer and a former top Merrill official in London.    A spokesman for Merrill Lynch in London said the company is conducting &quot;a full internal investigation&quot; of two loans totaling more than $1 million that Merrill Lynch International Bank Ltd. made to Michael J. Floersheim, a member of the Sofer group. The group reported the loans in December 1985, when it completed the purchase of a large stake in Ampal-American Israel Corp., a New York finance company that invests in Israel.    The Sofer group waged a hostile but unsuccessful proxy fight last summer for seats on Ampal's board of directors.    Last week the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Mr. Sofer and Nahum Vaskevitch, Merrill's former head of mergers and acquisitions in London, with masterminding a huge insider-trading scheme that yielded more than $4 million in illicit profits. The SEC charged that the scheme began in late 1984, a year before the Sofer group reported the Ampal purchases, which were partly financed by the Merrill Lynch loans.    The dissident Ampal group's filings with the SEC say Merrill made the loans to finance purchases by Mr. Floersheim, a close associate of Mr. Sofer. Mr. Floersheim, a wealthy Swiss metals trader, is described in the Ampal group's SEC filings as the sole shareholder of Plenmeer Ltd., a corporation the group used to make part of its Ampal purchases. Plenmeer also was named a defendant in the SEC action.    The SEC charged that Plenmeer was the vehicle for many of Mr. Sofer's alleged inside trades, which the commission said were based on leaks from Mr. Vaskevitch about takeovers in which Merrill played a role. The SEC said Mr. Floersheim refused to testify in its insider-trading investigation and, as a Swiss resident, couldn't be subpoenaed. Mr. Floersheim hasn't been charged with any wrongdoing.    Among the things Merrill is trying to determine is whether Mr. Vaskevitch had a role in obtaining the loans for Mr. Floersheim and the circumstances under which the loans were granted. Merrill officials said the loans have been repaid, although they couldn't immediately say when.    The Ampal proxy fight involved many of the same people mentioned in the SEC insider-trading complaint. Besides Mr. Sofer and Mr. Floersheim, the insurgent shareholder group included Louis Barnett, a Fort Worth, Texas, investor and close associate of Mr. Sofer. The SEC didn't charge Mr. Barnett with any wrongdoing, but its court papers contended that he funded and made profits from some of Mr. Sofer's alleged insider trades. The Ampal purchases weren't mentioned in the SEC suit.    The group bought about 25% of Ampal's common and 16% of the company's Class A stock, spending about $7 million in all. In its SEC filings, the group said Merrill lent Mr. Floersheim $908,500 for one purchase of Ampal stock, and an unspecified amount toward a separate $2.6 million purchase. The Merrill Lynch official in London said the two loans totaled more than $1 million.    The group is believed still to hold its Ampal stake, part of which has dropped in value by about 20%.    In American Stock Exchange trading, Ampal Class A stock closed yesterday at $2, compared with the dissident group's approximate average cost of $2.50 a share. Ampal common isn't publicly traded.    The Merrill Lynch official in London said the bank &quot;brought an end to the relationship&quot; with Mr. Floersheim when it discovered its name in the Sofer group's SEC filings in the U.S. Although Merrill Lynch knew the loans were being made to finance Ampal share purchases by Mr. Floersheim, the official said Merrill was originally unaware that the purchases would be used to support a proxy fight.    &quot;We don't finance hostile actions toward companies and we were pretty upset when our name came up&quot; in the filings, he said. He added that the loans were fully collateralized by Mr. Floersheim.    Messrs. Sofer, Vaskevitch and Floersheim didn't return calls seeking comment.    Ampal is controlled by Bank Hapoalim, one of Israel's largest banks. The insurgent shareholder group didn't directly state its reasons for the proxy fight in its SEC filings, but a letter from Mr. Barnett to Ampal's president after the fight suggested that Ampal split into two companies, reduce its overhead, and become more entrepreneurial.    Lawyers for Messrs. Sofer and Barnett wouldn't comment on the Ampal proxy fight and Merrill Lynch's role in it. </TEXT></DOC>
