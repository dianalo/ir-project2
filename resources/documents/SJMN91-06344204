On Sunday,sources at the firm sketched out the principal findings of their effort todetermine what happened to the more than $1 billion that is missing.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Front  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  DESPERATE MAXWELL RAIDED COMPANIES' FUNDS, SOURCESSAY  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     One of the keys to Maxwell's pressing need for cash stemmed from thedecline in the stock prices of two public companies, Mirror Group Newspapersand Maxwell Communications Corp., beginning last spring, a Coopers andamp; Lybrandexecutive said. Maxwell owned 68 percent of Mirror Group, which published fivenewspapers in Britain, and 51 percent of Maxwell Communications, the parent ofthe Macmillan publishing house in the United States and other companies.;  Maxwell had pledged his stock in those companies to bankers as collateral for$1.6 billion in loans they had made to his enterprises. But as the value ofthe two stocks declined starting in the spring, bankers sought more money fromMaxwell to protect the loans.;   Already overextended and unable to borrowmore funds, Maxwell secretly grabbed more than $700 million in cash frompension funds and more than $400 million from the companies' operations togive the bankers new collateral, Coopers andamp; Lybrand sources said. He also usedsome of the pension fund money in a bid to prop up the stock prices of thepublic companies, the sources said.;   Maxwell hoped higher stock prices wouldkeep the bankers from asking him for more collateral, the sources said. About$267 million in additional collateral went to eight banks and investmentfirms, including Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., Salomon Brothers Inc., Shearson LehmanBrothers Inc., Bankers Trust and Citicorp.;   Ultimately, Maxwell's effort toincrease the price of the falling shares by buying the stocks on the openmarket proved futile. While share support programs are not necessarily illegalin Great Britain, Maxwell appears to have spent the bulk of the missingpension fund money on the two stocks without the full knowledge of the pensionfunds' trustees. He also failed to disclose that he was using public companyfunds to prop up stock prices, sources said.;   Maxwell spent about $140million of the diverted public company funds on a collection of money-losingbusiness that he and his family privately owned, a Coopers andamp; Lybrand executivesaid. Among these was the European, a weekly English-language newspaper,started by Maxwell in 1990, that has been losing $1.4 million a week, and theDaily News, the ailing New York tabloid that Maxwell bought amid great fanfarein March.;   It will be months before the ultimate losses to British andAmerican banks can be calculated with certainty.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Washington Post  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  London  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911209  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  December  </MONTH><PG.COL>  7A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  532  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday, December 9, 199100344204,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
