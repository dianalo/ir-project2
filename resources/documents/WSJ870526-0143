The former employee, David Peterson, claims he was given $250,000 to set up a company to buy parts outside Northrop's own procurement offices, according to his attorney. The attorney, Robert Kilborne, said Mr. Peterson also claims that Northrop failed to submit the parts purchased this way to tests given equipment bought through normal channels and that Northrop discarded 80 boxes of equipment after the same parts turned up through its customary procurement procedures.    Mr. Peterson was manager of ground equipment manufacturing support for the MX project at Northrop until he resigned last month.    A Northrop spokesman said the Los Angeles-based defense company set up an outside firm, Liaison Engineering Services, to buy MX equipment &quot;on a fast track&quot; because Northrop was behind on its deliveries of MX parts. However, the spokesman said Northrop believes the firm was set up within Defense Department regulations.    The spokesman said Northrop couldn't comment on Mr. Peterson's claims regarding testing and discarding parts because &quot;we just heard about it.&quot; Investigators from the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigations visited Northrop last week.    Maj. Barry Glickman, a spokesman for the Air Force Ballistic Missile Office, said the office had also just learned about Mr. Peterson's claims from the subcommittee investigators. &quot;We're looking into it,&quot; he said.    The parts in question are used to test a basketball-sized electronic device known as the &quot;inertial measurement unit,&quot; which is made by Northrop as part of the guidance system on the MX nuclear-tipped missiles. The Air Force recently began withholding Northrop's $25-million monthly contract payments for the units because Northrop has been behind on deliveries.    As of the end of April, 33 of 50 units scheduled for delivery had been delivered and the Air Force had withheld a total of $59.3 million. The Air Force spokesman said the service expects to withhold Northrop's May payment.    The Air Force spokesman said the late deliveries hadn't affected the performance of the guidance unit, which the spokesman said performed accurately in all of its 17 flight tests. </TEXT></DOC>
