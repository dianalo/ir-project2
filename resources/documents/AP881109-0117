Democrats won four seats previously held by Republicans and theGOP captured two seats held by Democrats, raising the Democraticmargin of control to 56-44, a two-seat gain if Democrats hold on toFlorida.   Several races were decided by narrow tallies, and the contest inFlorida remained extremely tight and too close to call. Bymidmorning, Democratic Rep. Buddy MacKay's 8,000-vote lead overconservative Republican Rep. Connie Mack had dropped to about 5,300with 100,000 absentee ballots to be counted later in the day.   ``We might have a couple of recounts before we're done,'' saidTom Mason, a spokesman for the Republican Senatorial CampaignCommittee.   The GOP's wins came in Montana where former farm broadcasterConrad Burns edged out Democratic Sen. John Melcher, who was seekinga third term, and in Mississippi, where Rep. Trent Lott, the deputyHouse Republican leader, defeated Rep. Wayne Dowdy for the seatbeing vacated by Sen. John Stennis, the Senate's senior Democrat.   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, who went down to defeat with MichaelDukakis as the Democratic vice presidential candidate, did not endElection Day empty-handed. He won re-election to a fourth Senateterm.   The election decisions give President-elect George Bush theprospect of opening his administration with Congress solidly inDemocratic hands.   ``It's going to be tougher,'' said Senate Minority leader BobDole of Kansas, conceding that the GOP's numbers in the Senate wouldbe shaved in the 101st Congress. ``We're going to have fewer than wehad last year.''   But Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said he believes that Bushwill find a cooperative spirit on Capitol Hill because ``theproblems are too important for Congress not to work with thepresident.''   Connecticut Attorney General Joseph Lieberman edged Weicker by apaper-thin margin after a hard-fought campaign in which he accusedthe senator of pursuing his own brand of liberal politics whileignoring home state concerns.   Weicker, who first gained national attention as a gruff,outspoken member of the Senate Watergate Committee and who becameone of the Senate's most liberal and independent members, refused toconcede.   ``I wish I were here to declare a victory or defeat,'' Weickertold supporters. ``Unfortunately, I'm not in a position to do eitherright now.''   But he added: ``No matter how all this turns out, I don't haveone single gripe.''   Lieberman portrayed him in television commercials as a sleepingbear who missed important votes. The attack undermined Weicker'swinning coalition of moderate Republicans and Democrats.   The Senate race in Florida remained too close to call, andRepublicans had high hopes of picking up the seat of retiringDemocrat Lawton Chiles.   The race was so tight that a decision might rest in the countingof an estimated 100,000 absentee ballots. The Mack campaign saidthey expected to do better than MacKay since traditionally a largenumber of such ballots are cast by military personnel, a group thatMack considers among his constituency.   Mack's strategists said they would request an automatic recountof the ballots, a process to which they are entitled under Floridalaw if the winner and loser are separated by half a percentage pointor less.   Dole, who lost to George Bush in the party's presidentialprimaries, was critical of the Republican winner for doing toolittle to help GOP Senate candidates.   ``We could have used a little help from the vice president insome of the states _ Florida,'' Dole said. ``We pleaded with them togo to Florida.''   In Washington, former Republican Sen. Slade Gorton succeeded inhis comeback try despite strong opposition from Rep. Mike Lowry, aliberal Democrat. Gorton will succeed Sen. Daniel Evans, who isretiring.   Wyoming Republican Sen. Malcolm Wallop, one of the chamber's mostconservative members, withstood an unexpectedly strong challengefrom state Sen. John Vinich, a populist Democrat. With 99 percent ofthe vote counted, Wallop led 89,388 to 88,504 _ easily the closestoutcome of the year's 33 Senate races.   Vinich had accused Wallop of being out of touch with Wyoming'seconomic problems.   Millionaire Wisconsin businessman Herb Kohl, who spent millionsof dollars on his own race and declared his money gave him anindependence few could claim, defeated Susan Engeleiter, the GOPleader in the State senate. Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis., had heldthe seat since 1957.   In New Jersey, Democratic incumbent Frank Lautenberg withstood adetermined challenge by Republican Pete Dawkins, beating the formerRhodes scholar, football star and Army brigadier general in whatmany described as the nation's most negative campaign.   Brushing aside the issues of his age and health, 80-year-old Sen.Quentin Burdick, D-N.D., who underwent surgery in August for coloncancer, defeated state House Republican leader Earl Strinden, 56, tokeep the seat he has held since 1960.   In Virginia, former Democratic Gov. Charles Robb, the son-in-lawof the late President Lyndon B. Johnson, crushed black GOP candidateMaurice Dawkins for the seat of retiring Republican Paul Trible.Robb's reaction: ``How sweet it is.''   In Nebraska, Republican Sen. David Karnes, who was appointed tothe job, was defeated by former Democratic Gov. Bob Kerrey who wonthe Congressional Medal of Honor in the Vietnam War. Kerrey reactedto victory by bursting into song, singing a rendition of Australia's``Waltzing Matilda'' with its poignant words about a wounded soldier.   ``Let's waltz tonight and begin work tomorrow,'' Kerrey said.   In Nevada, Democratic Gov. Richard Bryan narrowly defeatedfreshman GOP incumbent Chic Hecht after a seesaw battle. Hecht borethe brunt of criticism accusing him of ineffectiveness in blockingplans to locate a nuclear waste dump in the state.   Ohio's Howard Metzenbaum, a liberal two-term Senate Democrat,turned back a challenge by heavily financed Cleveland Mayor GeorgeVoinovich.   Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., survived a strong challenge fromDemocratic Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy in the nation's most expensiveSenate race.   Rep. James Jeffords, a moderate Republican who has been Vermont'ssole House member for the past 14 years, won easily in his bid toclaim the seat of retiring GOP Sen. Robert Stafford.   In both parties, most incumbents easily won new terms.   Democratic winners included Robert Byrd of West Virginia, who isleaving his post as Democratic leader but will take over thechairmanship of the Appropriations Committee; Kennedy, chairman ofthe Labor and Human Resources Committee; Sen. George Mitchell,D-Maine, one of three senators seeking to replace Byrd as Democraticleader; Jim Sasser of Tennessee, Paul Sarbanes of Maryland; DanielPatrick Moynihan of New York; Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico; DonaldRiegle of Michigan; Dennis DeConcini of Arizona, and Spark Matsunagaof Hawaii.   Republican incumbents winning re-election included Sens. JohnHeinz of Pennsylvania; Richard Lugar of Indiana; John Danforth ofMissouri; William Roth of Delaware; John Chafee of Rhode Island;Orrin Hatch of Utah, and Minnesota's David Durenberger who defeatedstate Attorney General Hubert ``Skip'' Humphrey, son of the formersenator, vice president and 1968 Democratic presidential candidate.</TEXT></DOC>
