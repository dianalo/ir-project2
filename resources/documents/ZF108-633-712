 ICL's mainframe market is a constant source ofinterest in the trade, not least because of persistent speculation that thecompany is about to be sold by its parent STC Plc.andP;  However, gauging thehealth of a successful mainframe vendor's market is never easy because thebusiness, with its coveted profit margins, is shrouded in secrecy.andP;  ICL'sprimary geographical market for mainframes is the UK, but the company claimsa significant penetration in France, Germany, Denmark and Holland, as well asin Commonwealth strongholds such as Australasia, Africa, Asia and Hong Kong.andO;Around the world ICL has 3,000 mainframe accounts and Sayers admits that thenumber of accounts is not increasing as fast as it did in the 1970s,nevertheless, he expects them to grow at about 5% per year.andP;  This slowdown ingrowth is not vendor-specific, it is simply that the information technologyclimate has changed.andP;  Ironically enough, in the proprietary arena of the1970s, Sayers reckons, around 50% of accounts were prepared to switchsuppliers on the basis of a data processing manager's decision.andP;  Nowadays,there's a lot more investment tied up in software, particularly as with theadvent of open systems it is increasingly possible to move applicationsbetween different vendors' hardware.andM;Project HeinekenandM;You would think this would lead to more switches between suppliers, not less,but Sayers disputes this, explaining that manufacturers now spend a lot oftime and effort in building a relationship up with a customer, tying him into their hardware via software and services.andP;  For example, ICL has its&quot;Project Heineken&quot;, in which 20 or so organisations participate, to reach theparts other manufacturers can't reach.andP;  Under the project, when ICL isbuilding a new machine it takes the workloads of various large customers togive the new hardware a taste of the real world.andP;  In return Sayers sayscustomers get a ready-configured machine.andP;  The participating members meetwith ICL every quarter and discuss future hardware strategies.andP;  According toSayers, British Telecom, which is one participating organisation, is tryingto get other manufacturers to operate in the same way.andP;  Anyway schemes likethis mean that around 95% of mainframe customers stay with their favouredsupplier, since it can take up to 10 years to sever the connection with amainframe vendor completely.andP;  -andM;By Katy RingandM;Approximately 20% of ICL's mainframe business is derived from centralgovernment, with around 60% of its customer base lying beyond the governmentscenario in the utility and commercial markets - the Bankers' AutomatedClearing Service and the Automobile Association were cited as largecommercial customers - Sainsburys, once an ICL stronghold now has acentralised IBM system, while W H Smith still has a large ICL corporatecomputer but also buys a lot of DEC front ends.andP;  In the UK ICL has around1,000 corporate computing accounts, some 200 of which are large accountswhich will have at least one other manufacturer's hardware - most commonlyDEC VAXes at the front end of an ICL mainframe.andP;  Sayers says it is normalpolicy within large corporate organisations to have more than one hardwaresupplier nowadays to keep bids competitive.andP;  However, within the 800 or sosmaller corporate accounts, there are far more ICL-only sites.andP;  And withthese lie ICL's future, since with the combination of the company's recentlaunches, the Essex mainframe, the DRS 6000 and the PCT personal computerrange, combined with the preferred database, Ingres 6.0, Sayers says there isreally no reason for them to go elsewhere.andP;  With the decline of Honeywell,Sayers says ICL is making successful inroads into these vendors' customerbases.andP;  He reckons the mainframe business is growing internally in size atICL at about 40%, and that 45% of ICL's worldwide sales come from mainframesor corporate computing (which includes software and services, consultancy andso on).andP;  He believes that around half of ICL's sales of other products aredriven by mainframe sales.andM;Ingres 6.0andM;As for taking on IBM, ICL seems bearish - Sayers says customers rarely haveto choose between the two, but that if he were to have to construct a salespitch for a customer choosing between the two vendors he would emphasiseapplications such as OfficePower and the superiority of the VME operatingsystem as against MVS.andP;  He has no worries about ICL facing a demise ofsoftware applications, since, he says, there are more and more softwarehouses appearing on the scene writing for Unix systems, and, as ICL is aproud member of both Unix International and X/Open it has no qualms that itshardware may die from a lack of interest by software developers.andO;Particularly, since VME may (ho hum) be described as X/Open conformantbecause it will soon be Portability Guide 3-compliant, and Unix source codecan be recompiled to run under VME.andP;  Communications between the DRS 6000 andSeries 39 mainframes is key to the future of VME.andP;  For this purpose Ingres iscrucial, since it integrates applications running between the Unix box andmainframes.andP;  The launch of Ingres 6.0 by the end of this year is particularlyexciting for ICL, since this version will work with its information retrievalsystem CAFS, and integrates with ICL's database management system IDMSX.andO;This means that users can run applications with Ingres and switch betweenIngres and IDMSX or use CAFS with Ingres as an alternative to IDMSX.andP;  Sayerssays that there is a strong ICL imprint on Ingres 6.0, especially in itsability to provide a CAFS type of functionality.andP;  Sayers says ICL has helpedIngres develop into an open systems product, encouraging the company to getinto the DEC and IBM market, where ICL believes it can make a killing withOfficePower which is integrated with Ingres.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
