The French, caught off guard, bided their time before mounting a two-pronged counterattack against the German expeditionary forces. The outcome remains in doubt.    No, you haven't missed the start of World War III. This raging battle isn't being fought with tanks and guns but with women's magazines and encyclopedias, book clubs and television listings. It pits West German publishing giant Bertelsmann AG against French publishing giant Hachette S.A. To the victor goes dominance of what could soon be the world's biggest single consumer market, 320 million Europeans.    The current battleground: the U.S.    The latest moves in the struggle are Hachette's twin acquisitions this month of Grolier Inc. and Diamandis Communications Inc. for a total of $1.16 billion, which suddenly makes the French company the world's biggest publisher of encyclopedias and magazines. Hachette's total annual revenues will now approach $4 billion.    Two years ago Bertelsmann stormed into the U.S., buying Doubleday Inc. and the records division of RCA Inc. for a total of $800 million. This made the privately held West German company the world's biggest media conglomerate, with projected 1988 revenue of $6.3 billion.    Now the French publish the Book of Knowledge and American Photographer magazine, and the Germans publish Lee Iacocca and sell Whitney Houston albums.    The ways Bertelsmann and Hachette are waging their struggle reflect two companies with diametrically different styles, and a look at these two emerging European-American publishing giants may offer a glimpse of where the media future lies on both sides of the Atlantic.    The strategy behind their acquisitions is double-sided. Both corporations think they made shrewd purchases of solid companies relatively cheaply because of the low value of the dollar against their home currencies. Both think they can use European management and distribution techniques to increase cash flow from their new U.S. units.    That cash will soon be needed back home. European companies in all fields have begun frantic dashes for growth before 1992, when most Common Market internal trade barriers will fall and competition within Europe will increase. Convinced that they will have to be bigger to survive under the new rules, they have been reorganizing, buying smaller rivals, and making cross-border alliances. French companies like Hachette see German companies like Bertelsmann as the main threat. German companies know they are ahead, and aim to make the most of their advantage.    &quot;With the dollar where it is, there are opportunities now in the U.S. that won't be there in two, five or 10 years' time,&quot; says John Perriss, world-wide media director for Saatchi andamp; Saatchi Co. in London. Mr. Perriss's own company has become the world's biggest advertising agency largely through U.S. acquisitions. &quot;Good and profitable acquisitions now,&quot; he says, &quot;will fill your war chest for the real fight back home.&quot;    Another reason European media companies are leapfrogging borders is that they are outgrowing their home markets. They can't yet easily expand across those borders because of lingering trade barriers. Hemmed in, they are being nibbled at by government restrictions and perky competition.    Bertelsmann is banned by antitrust authorities from making any more German media acquisitions. On top of that, its home market has stagnated; Bertelsmann's German revenue grew by only 6% last year, compared with a 31% surge in revenue from outside Germany, which now accounts for 66% of the total.    Hachette, which claims it is now the world's fourth-biggest media company, behind Bertelsmann, Capital Cities/ABC Inc., and Time Inc., is being driven abroad in part by challenges at home. Group de la Cite, a recent agglomeration of publishing companies, is in most of Hachette's lines and owns half of the world's biggest book club, which sells at great profit 26 million books a year to one Frenchman in every five. More worrying for Hachette: The other half of the book club belongs to Bertelsmann, which manages it.    This coming battle for Europe is already having far-reaching effects in the U.S. Bertelsmann has brought in fresh management to revive Doubleday and has slashed overhead at RCA Records. Hachette's innovative Premiere and Elle magazines, published in the U.S. in a joint venture with Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., have shaken up the magazine industry, and Hachette promises more new U.S. magazines.    It isn't always easy, of course. Publishing analysts on both sides of the Atlantic say Hachette probably overpaid by shelling out $712 million for 13 Diamandis magazines; two years ago Hachette had unsuccesfully bid just $600 million for the same magazines and seven others when they belonged to CBS Inc. Bertelsmann's Gruner andamp; Jahr subsidiary took an embarrassing $30 million hit in 1979 when it tried to launch a U.S. version of GEO, its glossy natural-science magazine. That same year, Daniel Filipacchi, Hachette vice president and the mastermind of Elle and Premiere magazines, flopped in the U.S. with an attempted revival of Look magazine.    And there is always the danger that, by basing their growth firmly in the English-speaking world, the French and German companies will provoke counterattacks by British or Americans. &quot;I see 10 surviving, huge media companies in the next 10 years,&quot; says Brownen Maddox, publishing industry analyst for Kleinwort Grieveson Securities in London. &quot;Six or seven will be American, two or three may be British, Bertelsmann will be there, and probably Hachette.&quot;    Hachette, a 162-year-old, until recently sleepy publisher of French schoolbooks, is now headed by a flashy entrepreneur who likes to project the breezy sophistication of Elle magazine combined with an iron will. Its modern era began in 1981 when it was acquired by defense contractor Matra S.A. and Matra's chairman, Jean-Luc Lagardere, now 60 years old.    Ever-tanned, with a politician's charisma, Mr. Lagardere not only runs Hachette and Matra, which makes the Mistral surface-to-air missile; he also recruits expensive stars for his Matra-Racing soccer team and pops up now and then behind a microphone on his radio station Europe 1. Before Mr. Lagardere took over Hachette, it was a money-losing company whose greatest achievement had been selling 160 million copies of a French spelling book. He transformed the company, whose nickname was &quot;the green octopus&quot; because its newspaper delivery vans were green and its tentacles spread all over, into a cash-rich barracuda.    At last week's Paris Book Fair, Hachette stands dominated the middle of the huge exhibition hall, displaying comic books (a serious matter here), travel guides, cookbooks, potboilers, and political treatises by or about virtually every French presidential candidate. One of every three books sold in France comes from Hachette. Elle magazine now sells 3.6 million copies a month in 13 countries, including China. The French equivalent of TV Guide, Tele 7 Jours, sells 3.2 million copies a week. With its recent U.S. buys, Hachette, says it will sell this year 650 million copies of 74 different magazines in 10 languages.    Along the path to this peak, Hachette has taken some knocks. Mr. Lagardere had his heart set on taking over France's leading television channel, TF1, when it was privatized last year and combining it with the radio station into a Europe-wide broadcasting power. Instead, the government sold the TV station to a construction mogul. Mr. Lagardere then tried several prototypes for a new daily newspaper in France, none of which got past the testing stage. He still says he wants to expand into TV and newspapers.    And he is still bitter about losing TF1. &quot;It would have been a big help in the coming hand-to-hand combat with Bertelsmann,&quot; he says. As compensation, the two U.S. acquisitions should swell Hachette's treasury by 5 billion francs (about $1 billion) over the next 10 years. That money, Hachette executives say, will be used for expansion in all areas of communications in countries where English, French and Spanish are spoken. The goal: Catch Bertelsmann.    &quot;I ask myself constantly,&quot; says Mr. Lagardere, &quot;how a company whose native language is spoken by so few people can become the biggest media company in the world? The answer is amassing financial resources and conquering the English-speaking world. Our challenge is to get into the top ranks with them and stay there. And we're going to go all the way.&quot;    Bertelsmann has come a long way from Carl Bertelsmann's first hymnal 135 years ago. The media company's offices, warehouses and compact-disk factory dominate the small North German town of Guetersloh, otherwise known for its pumpernickel bread. The company isn't flashy, but it is a supremely efficient generator of money.    Bertelsmann's modern era reflects the economic miracle in West Germany since World War II. Its factories were flattened by British bombers, and the senior surviving member of the owning family, Reinhard Mohn, spent three years in a prison camp in Kansas. When he got back home, Mr. Mohn rebuilt the company on book clubs, its growth engine during the 1950s.    Bertelsmann lost its way a bit in the 1960s when some ill-planned diversification led it into movie production and chicken farming. It got back to the basics of books and magazines in the 1970s, when it bought magazine publisher Gruner andamp; Jahr and expanded into the rest of Europe. &quot;When I came in 1968,&quot; recalls chief executive Mark Woessner, &quot;Hachette was three times as big as we were. By the end of the '70s, we were twice as big as they were.&quot;    Bertelsmann gnaws at Hachette in France. Besides the half interest in the book club, Bertelsmann's Gruner andamp; Jahr unit has successfully launched two women's magazines, Prima and Femme Actuel, under Hachette's nose in France. It also started a rival French TV magazine two years ago, which sells 1.2 million copies a week but still loses money.    The company owns no professional soccer team and worries more about internal than external relations. Mr. Woessner, silver-haired at 49, has the charisma of an evangelist, not a movie star. During an interview in his large office overlooking Carl Bertelsmann Strasse, Guetersloh's main street, Mr. Woessner talks of quality, competence and partnership, a reference to the nearly 50% of Bertelsmann profit that goes into employee profit-sharing plans each year.    Mr. Woessner took Bertelsmann to America, first with the ill-fated GEO, then with the twin purchases of Doubleday and RCA Records. Bertelsmann has given itself until 1992 to digest these two companies but probably won't need that much time. Mr. Woessner says he doesn't plan another major U.S. buy soon, but he does want to build Bertelsmann's U.S. magazine business by adding new titles.    For the 1990s, Bertelsmann is trying to figure out a way into the Far East, where it currently has only a small music company, in Japan. But above all it is looking to television, first in Germany, where with a partner it owns a growing private TV network, RTL Plus, and later in Europe.    Mr. Woessner says Bertelsmann wants to be the best, not necessarily the biggest, and says &quot;the competition will be everybody.&quot; But big moves into U.S. magazines and European television could pit Bertelsmann squarely against one competitor in particular: Hachette. Mr. Woessner smiles at this suggestion. &quot;The competition,&quot; he repeats, &quot;will be everybody.&quot;    ---                       Bertelsmann AG    1988 estimate    Revenue: $6.3 billion    Net Income: $157 million    Employees: 42,000    Countries where present: 25    Principal U.S. Properties:    RCA Records    (Labels include RCA,     Arista, Ariola)                      $1.08 billion*    Doubleday Inc.
