More than half of the combustion power is installedin melt firing systems. Therefore a large part of the ash is generatedin the form of easily utilizable granulate. The hard coal ash from firingsystems with dry ash removal (fly ash) is utilized to more than 75%.Up to 87% of the granulate is utilized. Besides the possibilities andfields of application of hard coal ash the tendencies of change nowadaysin the utilization of ash are discussed, which result from activitiesfor environmental protection. Procedures like low air combustion, useof special burners, stepwise supply of air or fuel respectively, whichhelp to diminish the formation of NO/sub x/, may influence in some casesthe fly ash properties relative to its utilization. An optimum designof an environment protecting hard coal firing system therefore has toaccount also for these aspects. 4 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
