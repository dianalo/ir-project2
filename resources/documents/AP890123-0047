(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   PTL founder Jim Bakker has selected as hisattorney a flamboyant octogenarian whose legal career spans sixdecades and whose clients have included Alfried Krupp at theNuremberg trials.   George T. Davis may not be a household name like Melvin Belli orF. Lee Bailey, but he has defended some notable clients, includingKrupp, heir to the German munitions empire who was convicted in 1948of war crimes and sentenced to 12 years. He was released after threeyears.   Among the others: Caryl Chessman, who was executed for kidnappingtwo women and sexually assaulting them in 1948, and labor agitatorTom Mooney, who was sentenced to death for his participation in the1916 bomb killings of 10 people in California. Mooney was given anunconditional pardon in 1939.   Throughout Davis' long career, his courtroom style often has beencolorful.   ``I always try my cases a little differently,'' Davis said.``Let's just leave it at that.''   His background includes paying his way through the law school ofthe University of California at Berkeley in the 1920s by playingdrums in a jazz band. He has studied hypnosis, portrayed himself ina documentary, and is writing a book about the death penalty.   At 81, Davis remains active, as evidenced by his workout beforean 8 a.m. interview last week. He still finds time to work on hishorse ranch in Hawaii, where he lives with his fourth wife, Ginger.Davis walks his dog for an hour every morning and he occasionallysurfs.   Explaining that he didn't want to jeopardize chances of getting agag order he sought last week, Davis agreed to discuss the PTL caseonly in general terms and his impressions of his client.   Bakker, 48, and his former top deputy, Richard Dortch, 57, wereaccused in a Dec. 5 indictment of diverting more than $4 million inPTL funds for their personal use. Two other former aides, brothersDavid and James Taggart, were accused in a separate indictment withfederal tax violations.   All four have pleaded innocent to the charges, which came at theend of a 16-month grand jury investigation. Bakker's U.S. DistrictCourt trial has not been scheduled.   Davis, who spent most of his career in San Francisco beforemoving to Hawaii, met Bakker the day the indictments were issued.   He was introduced to Bakker through a mutual acquaintance, aTexas minister. Davis, no supporter of Bakker's ministry in thepast, did not discuss his religious views nor did he cite religionas a motive.   Neither was it money or prestige that persuaded him to take thecase, he said.   ``This is one of my `cause' cases,'' he said. ``I've always beenmotivated to help people. This case is complicated and it'sdifficult. It just fits into what my whole lifetime motivation hasbeen.   ``For that reason I was ready to make the sacrifice, and believeme, there's no amount of money that could cover the sacrifice ofgiving up four to six months of my time. At this stage, it is worth... a lot more than any money.   ``It's like a glass of water on the desert. How much is it worth?It's worth a lot more if it's the last glass.''   Davis' first impression of Bakker persuaded him to take the case.   ``I don't think he's a criminal,'' he said. ``I think he wasoverwhelmed by the immensity of the work that he was doing.   ``When you stop to think of all the operations he was running andfunding and handling and the need that he had for help, forassistance, he's really not a managerial type. He's a minister,''Davis said. ``My whole judgment of him is that he's a decent, honestman of his word.''   Moreover, it doesn't bother him that Bakker is not universallyloved.   ``Almost every case that I've ever handled has been for adefendant who at the time he crossed my threshold was considered adespicable guy,'' he said. ``That part doesn't bother me at all.''</TEXT></DOC>
