I sacrifice my neck.&quot;;   The story of Farisdaq and Zubeida isone of 20 in a collection by Fawzia Dorai, a brash Kuwaiti advice columnist,titled &quot;Love Under Occupation.&quot;;   As she reads the story, Dorai licks herthick copper lipstick and sighs, &quot;So beautiful.&quot;;   But no Kuwaiti may everget to read it.;   That love story was one of two in her book that came backfrom Kuwait's censors marked &quot;Do not publish.&quot; Dorai is about to do battlewith what many authors complain is increasingly strict censorship, pledging topublish all or none.;    DORAI says the stories are true -- with minor detailschanged to disguise identities. As a mark of authenticity, she offers todredge up the whip used by a masochist double agent.;   Most were collectedduring the occupation. Dorai stayed in Kuwait, going underground once when theIraqis tried to force her to work for their newspaper and again when anunflattering psychological profile she wrote on Iraqi President Saddam Husseinfell into their hands.;   How did she get all the lurid True Romance details?;  &quot;What do you mean how? I am the most famous advice columnist in thiscountry. Everyone calls me!&quot; she bellows from behind her vast desk during aninterview last week.;   She has to unplug the phone in her office at Al-Watannewspaper to get through an interview.;   Between calls, she endlessly adjuststhe scarf used to cover her hair according to Islamic custom. But none of thatplain black-and-white cloth -- hers always match the bright reds, greens andyellows used on her dress, purse and nails.;   Dorai, 38, holds master'sdegrees in psychology and sex education from Pacific Lutheran University inTacoma, Wash., and spends part of her time as a sex therapist at Kuwait'sPsychiatric Hospital.;   Many callers want sex therapy on the phone. Shealways insists on a personal meeting.;   Dorai avoids politics, but is anoutspoken advocate for free speech and full equality for men and women. Herfrank columns on sex have gained her a wide readership among both men andwomen.;   &quot;A veiled woman writing about sex. Can you imagine? They love it,sweetie,&quot; she says laughing.;   Religious leaders and other conservatives findit too daring. Kuwaiti women circulate freely, and many do not wear anyIslamic dress, but the puritanical religious traditions are still the publicyardstick on behavior.;   &quot;She has lots of readers because she writes onsensitive issues that are important for many,&quot; Kuwaiti novelist Lailaal-Othman said. &quot;Her style is also sexually provocative. . . . It is nice tohave a daring writer like her, but she should be more aware of the realityaround her.&quot;;   CENSORSHIP laws ban anything that contradicts public decency,morals or religion or otherwise might give offense.;   In Dorai's collection,&quot;most of the censored parts are about sexual things that go beyond ourtraditions. We don't think these ought to be written about,&quot; Amal al-Hamadsaid, speaking for the Ministry of Information.;   Some stories were passedwith no deletions.;   The author's favorite is &quot;The Apartment.&quot; A Kuwaitiofficer desperate to find a safe haven for his wife as the Iraqi army closesin drops her at an apartment full of his clothes and favorite foods. Glancingat a framed document on the wall, she discovers her husband had taken anotherwife without telling her.;   Dorai hopes the stories will document the humanside of the occupation, but thinks it will take more than a book: &quot;Thesestories belong on the screen.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  NEIL MACFARQUHAR, Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Kuwait City  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911219  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  December  </MONTH><PG.COL>  2A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  676  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday, December 19, 199100354231,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
