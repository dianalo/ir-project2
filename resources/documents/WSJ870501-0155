DorfmanStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 05/01/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR)SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) </IN><TEXT>   The Securities Industry Association and several major brokerage firms are pushing hard to lower the standards for defining an &quot;accredited investor.&quot;    If the bid succeeds, perhaps two million people with moderate wealth who now don't invest in private placements would be eligible to do so. Whether that would be doing them a favor is open to dispute.    An accredited investor is presumed sophisticated enough to evaluate investment opportunities without the benefit of a prospectus, and wealthy enough to bear the risk of loss if an investment goes sour. Thus, he or she can invest in private placements -- offerings that involve a limited number of participants and aren't registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission.    As many as 35 non-accredited investors may participate in a private placement. But if such a placement involves $5 million or more, any investors must be &quot;sophisticated,&quot; a slippery term defined mainly by case law. By sticking with accredited investors, as defined by the SEC, a sponsor can avoid possible legal problems.    The required annual gross income for an accredited investor would be $100,000 if the SIA gets its way; it is now $200,000. In determining who meets the income test, the SIA wants a husband's and wife's incomes to be combined; they count separately now. Also, the SIA wants to lower the threshold on an alternate requirement, net worth, to $500,000 from $1 million. The SEC staff probably will give the agency's commissioners recommendations on the proposed changes by late summer.    Earlier this year, the SEC solicited public comment on the proposals. The agency received some 200 comments, mostly from brokerage houses and real-estate syndicators supporting the changes, including Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., PaineWebber Inc.; Bear, Stearns and Co.; Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.; and Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co.    &quot;So few investors can qualify under (the current) test that it is nearly discriminatory, only allowing the very richest and most successful investors to even consider certain direct investments into special business opportunities,&quot; wrote Richard W. Brescoll, a senior vice president of First of Michigan Corp..    Supporters of the changes say they need looser rules because SEC registration is burdensome and costly, especially for smaller offerings. Registration can double the cost of an offering, says Stephen Treadway, a senior vice president at Smith Barney and a leader of the SIA's drive.    Proponents of the changes also argue that private-placement investors would be adequately protected without the traditional shield of a prospectus. Some say state disclosure requirements and existing federal rules (short of full-scale SEC registration) provide enough protection.    No consumer groups filed written comment, but officials of some such groups -- who say they weren't aware of the proposed changes -- oppose them. Their fear, shared by some academics and regulators, is that a $100,000 threshold would draw in a lot of financially unsophisticated people -- and that securities regulations aren't adequate in most states.    Mark Silbergeld, head of the Washington office of Consumers Union, says a $100,000 test &quot;has nothing to do with sophistication. It has to do with who is a good target. It has to do with who is worth bilking.&quot;    Stephen Brobeck, executive director of the Consumer Federation of America, suggests that some families might have a net worth of $500,000 mainly because of a rise in the market value of their home. The SIA proposal, he suggests, might &quot;subject upper-middle income families to financial risks they could not easily assess.&quot;    Though private placements can be used for stock or bond issues, in recent years they have been used mainly for limited partnerships in real-estate and oil-and-gas ventures. Peter Harrington, director of the Massachusetts Securities Division, says those backing the changes may be seeking a new market for partnerships since tax changes have hurt their sale as tax shelters.    Mr. Treadway of Smith Barney emphasizes that the proposed changes would help small businesses by making it easier to raise capital. And because many brokerage houses already have extensive contacts with investors making around $100,000, he says the marketing opportunity is &quot;tremendous.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
