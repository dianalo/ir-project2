Japan's Economic Planning Agency said Friday that inflation-adjusted GNP, which measures the nation's output of goods and services, didn't expand in the first quarter ended June 30. In the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year, GNP had grown at a 4.9% annual rate and by 1.2% from the preceding quarter.    The lack of first-quarter growth was a disappointment to the government, which has predicted that the economy will expand 3.5% in the full fiscal year, up from 2.6% in the preceding 12 months. A planning agency official asserted Friday that &quot;there are still sufficient possibilities that the 3.5% figure will be attained.&quot; But private economists said that the first-quarter report made it uncertain whether the target can be met.    Beyond the question of whether the target is obtainable, however, both goverment and private economists said that the economy is moving toward a greater reliance on domestic demand, as desired.    Japan's economy slumped -- in the quarter ended March 31, 1986, it contracted at a 2.1% annual rate, the first contraction in 11 years -- as the strong yen badly hurt its export industries. In September 1985, the world's five major industrialized democracies launched a concerted effort to lower the dollar's value in order to narrow the wide U.S. trade deficit. The yen began to rise rapidly, making Japanese exports more expensive in terms of other currencies.    With its export-oriented economy reeling, and with the government under pressure from the U.S. to import more and export less, Japan has been trying to stimulate domestic demand. Indeed, the lack of growth in the fiscal first quarter stemmed from the fact that external demand fell 1.1%, negating a 1.2% increase in domestic demand. The increase in domestic demand accelerated from the 0.8% gain in the fourth quarter of the previous fiscal year.    Exports declined 1.6% in the fiscal first quarter from the prior three months. And a &quot;significant&quot; 5.9% increase in imports contributed to the absence of economic growth, the planning agency said.    Susumu Taketomi, senior economist and deputy general manager of Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd., said the quarter illustrated that the economy is in a transition phase to greater reliance on domestic demand. The flat economy, he said, showed that factors relating to the domestic economy &quot;are taking their expected course.&quot;    &quot;It's a good pattern,&quot; he said.    Added a planning agency economist: &quot;The zero growth isn't bad news for Japan. The stalemate is where we want to be in the process of restructuring the export-led economy . . . .Domestic demand is expanding steadily, supported by a boom in housing and public works, triggered by government efforts to stimulate it through an economic package.&quot;    Last May, the cabinet approved a stimulative package including five trillion yen ($35 billion) in public expenditures. On Saturday, as part of the stimulative efforts, the upper house of Japan's parliament approved legislation providing for 2.2 trillion yen in tax cuts. The measures had been approved by the lower house earlier. But part of the effect of the cuts will be negated by another part of the legislation, under which tax-exempt savings accounts will be abolished.    Another senior economist at Industrial Bank, Yuji Watanabe, said that the 1.2% increase in domestic demand during the quarter suggested an annual rate of near 5%, indicating that domestic demand will help spur economic growth for the rest of the fiscal year. He noted that most of the effect of the government expenditures won't be seen until the next quarter.    Mr. Watanabe added, however, that it wasn't clear whether the government's target of 3.5% growth in the full fiscal year can be met. &quot;That's difficult to predict,&quot; he said. &quot;But I do think it will hit the 3% line.&quot;    Sumitomo Bank Ltd.'s chief economist, Toshiaki Kakimoto, said the 3.5% goal &quot;may be a little too much.&quot; Earlier this year, Sumitomo predicted annual growth would be 2.9%. Mr. Kakimoto said the bank had projected growth of only 0.1% in the fiscal first quarter.    In the fiscal year ended last March 31, the government originally set a 4% growth target. It subsequently lowered its goal to 3%, which was still above the 2.6% expansion actually reported.    Mr. Kakimoto said the decline in external demand could worsen over the short term but will eventually stabilize. &quot;There are clearer forms coming into focus,&quot; he said. One positive sign of domestic growth, he noted, was a 4.3% increase in private-sector home investment during the quarter.    Personal spending, accounting for about 60% of total GNP, grew 0.7% in the fiscal first quarter, slower than the robust 1.8% expansion in the fiscal fourth quarter. A planning agency economist said, however, that the figure &quot;wasn't that much of a chill&quot; and would be pushed higher in coming months by the stimulative measures. </TEXT></DOC>
