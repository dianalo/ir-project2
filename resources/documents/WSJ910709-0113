While public accountants act as outside auditors andadvisers, management accountants work for companies. Theranks of management accountants are growing rapidly, whilethe number of independent accountants is stagnating.</LP><TEXT>   For years the American Institute of Certified PublicAccountants and the National Association of Accountants havecoexisted fraternally, with nary a spat. But now budgets aretight, membership growth is essential -- and competitionbetween the two is escalating sharply. The 305,000-memberAicpa, the leading group for public accountants, plans a newmembership unit solely for management accountants.   But management accounting is the main turf of the94,000-member National Association of Accountants, whichbelieves it better prepares accountants for jobs in industry.To fight back, the National Association has changed its nameto the Institute for Management Accountants and plans morejoint conferences with industry to attract members. Themanagement institute is also stepping up its challenge to thelongtime supremacy of Aicpa's national CPA exam with its ownexam for a certified management accountant.   &quot;The two organizations are headed for a collision course,&quot;asserts Ettore Barbatelli Sr., a former president of themanagement institute and chairman of a Milwaukeeasset-appraisal firm. &quot;There's no question that the Aicpaplans to invade the {management institute's} membershipranks, where 25% of the members are CPAs.&quot;   Eric Schindler, chairman of the Aicpa's industrycommittee, says that the Aicpa will probably start the newunit for management accountants within a year. But Mr.Schindler, a CPA and vice president, finance andadministration, at Columbia Paint Co., Spokane, Wash.,insists that the Aicpa isn't trying to put the managementinstitute out of business. &quot;We're simply trying to serve asignificant segment of the Aicpa's membership,&quot; he says. Morethan 40% of Aicpa members work for industry and comprise theAicpa's fastest growing membership group.   Mr. Schindler says that the new management accountingdivision would focus on such technical areas as costaccounting and activity-based accounting, which are used byindustry accountants.   The Aicpa has long held the upper hand in attractingaccountants because of the influence it carries with stateboards of accountancy. These boards recognize only certifiedpublic accountants for auditing corporate financialstatements. Consequently, the national CPA exam has long beenthe key to obtaining jobs at accounting firms and inindustry.   But in recent years, the exam for management accounting,initiated in 1972, has been gaining ground on the CPA exam asan important step to getting a job in the financialdepartments of big companies. About 1,900 accountants tookthe management-accounting exam for the first time in June, up43% from a year earlier, the IMA says. In comparison, therewere about 25,000 first-time CPA exam takers in May, or aboutthe same as a year before, according to the Aicpa.   &quot;We don't see public accounting growing as dramatically asmanagement accounting in years to come, and it's conceivablethat we could be bigger than the Aicpa by the next century,&quot;says Gary Scopes, the management institute's executivedirector. &quot;The Aicpa's plan to have its own managementaccounting unit certainly got our attention,&quot; he adds. &quot;Itmade us move a lot more quickly on our name change.&quot;   Some companies are finding the management-accounting exammore useful in training their staffs than the CPA exam. &quot;Overthe long term, the {management exam} is a better measure of aperson's capability to manage personnel in industry,&quot; saysClark Johnson, vice president, finance, of Johnson andamp; JohnsonInc., New Brunswick, N.J. The CPA exam tests auditing,accounting, practice and legal knowledge, while themanagement exam test includes questions on economics,management motivation and corporate decision-making.</TEXT></DOC>
