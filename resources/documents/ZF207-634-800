It's the proportional font.andM;Figure 2 shows this proportional font in one of the Presentation Manager Helpwindows.andP;  Personally, I find this font more readable than any fixed-pitchfont I've ever seen on a computer screen.andP;  As we use our computers more andmore to access information through CD-ROM or on-line services, we're going toneed an environment in which we can read on-screen text with the same easethat we read printed documents; a proportional font will help considerably.andM;With the availability of inexpensive laser printers, it has become possibleto produce professional-looking documents with our personal computers.andO;Typographers have known for centuries how the use of different fonts, sizes,line spacing, and other factors can affect the tone of a document, sometimessubtly and sometimes not so subtly.andP;  Puffing the power of font selection andmanipulation into the personal computer is an important step in the PC'sevolution.andP;  (Of course, anyone who has seen the work of amateur desktoppublishers realizes how easily this power can be abused.andP;  Restraint should beLesson One in good graphic design.)andM;From the programmer's perspective, proportional fonts are much more difficultto implement than are fixed-pitch fonts.andP;  Every character in a fixed-pitchfont has the same width, so it's easy for a program to calculate how manycharacters will fit in a particular space.andP;  It's a snap to show on the screenwhat will be printed on a printer.andP;  A proportional font adds obviouscomplexities to this process.andP;  Yet, the results are well worth the extraeffort.andM;People who work mostly with text and numbers on their PCs sometimes questionwhy graphics are necessary.andP;  However, these are precisely the people whoshould be embracing graphics most fervently! It's very simple: the properdisplay of text requires a proportional font, and a proportional fontrequires graphics.andP;  Therefore, anyone who really cares about text should takeas his goal the eventual banishment of the fixed-pitch font, save only forsuch specialized applications as hex dumps and program listings.andM;The distinction we often draw between text and graphics is essentiallyartificial.andP;  It arises from the (temporary) limitations imposed by primitivecomputer hardware.andP;  In the real world, text is graphics, and the properrendering of text is the highest achievement of the graphic arts.andO;Consequently, there can be no greater goal of a graphics programming systemthan to allow us to work with text in a powerful and flexible manner.andP;  THEGRAPHICS BATTLEGROUNDandM;We're entering a decade of computing, in which the graphical user interface(GUI) will be a common sight on computers of all shapes and sizes.andP;  Debateswill not center on the validity of the GUI, or on whether a machine that hasa GUI is better than one that does not.andP;  Debates will focus instead on whichis the best GUI.andM;A major part of any graphical interface is its underlying graphicsprogramming system.andP;  The Macintosh has QuickDraw; Microsoft Windows has theGraphics Device Interface (GDI), the Presentation Manager has the GraphicsProgramming Interface (GPI); the NeXT computer has Display PostScript; Unixhas the X-Window system, which includes a graphics system; and Sun has NeWS,which includes a PostScript-like graphics language.andM;Although these graphics systems can be compared in many ways, in the yearsahead I think that their text-handling ability will become an increasinglyimportant consideration.andP;  We will ask: how flexible is the font-selectionlogic? Can the fonts be manipulated, and in what ways? How quickly can thesystem display text? Is there a good match between printer fonts and screenfonts? And most importantly: is the text displayed on the screen and onprinted page attractive and readable?andM;Achieving a satisfactory answer to these questions is not easy, especially inan open-architecwre market such as the one that has grown around the IBM PC.andO;For example, matching screen fonts and printer fonts becomes an enormousproblem when you consider all the combinations of video displays and printersthat can be connected to an IBM-compatible machine.andM;To understand the concepts and problems involved with text in a graphicssystem , let's begin by examining the cuffent font-selection and -generationtechniques used in the OS/2 Graphics Programming Interface.andP;  BASIC PM TEXTAND FONT FUNCTIONSandM;A Presentation Manager program uses die same GPI functions for displayingtext on its window as on a hard-copy device, such as a printer, plotter, ordigital camera.andM;There are four text-output functions: GpiCharString, GpiCharStringAt,GpiCharString Pos, and GpiCharStringPosAt.andP;  All these functions display atext string beginning from a reference point-either die current knownposition or a point specified in the function itself.andP;  The two functionscontaining the word Pos allow passing an array of increments for nondefaultintercharacter spacing of the letters in the string.andP;  This is useful forfull, left-right text justification.andP;  Several additional GPI function s allowa program to draw text at an angle (GpiSetCharAngle), to tilt the charactersto achieve a sheared or oblique effect (GpiSetCharShear), and the like.andM;Text is usually displayed in a default font.andP;  For the video display, thisdefault is the proportionally spaced system font used in PM title bars,menus, dialog boxes, and so forth.andP;  For printers, the default font can bejust about anything.andP;  (Some printer drivers even allow the user to specifythe default font in a printer-sewp dialog box invoked from the ControlPanel.)andM;A program can specify use of a different font by first seaing up a FAT-fRS(font attributes) strucwre and calling GpiCreateLogFont.andP;  The FATTRSstructure contains a description of the font-the typeface name, its size, andattributes, such as boldface, italics, and underline.andP;  A call toGpiSetCharSet will cause the GPI to use this font to display subsequent text.andM;Prograrn s often have to obtain information about the current font.andP;  This isthe job of GpiQueryFontMetrics, which uses the FONTMETRICS structure toreturn various font dimensions and characteristics.andP;  (The FONTMETRICSstrucwre has 49 fields and is the largest structure in the PresentationManager API.) The GpiQueryTextBox function returns the dimensions of a textstring in terms of the coordinates of the comers of a box that, if displayed,would enclose the string.andP;  GpiQueryCharStringPosAt returns an array ofincrements that indicate the point at which each character in a stringbegins.andP;  The GpiQueryWidthTable function lets a program obtain the widths ofall the characters in the font.andM;A program can use GpiQuelyFonts to obtain FONTMETRICS structures for all thefonts available for a particular graphics output device.andP;  In a practicalsense, this function is a prerequisite for any but the most basic use offonts.andP;  DEVICE FONTS, GENERIC FONTSandM;The fonts available to a particular graphics output device can be categorizedin various ways.andP;  One very important distinction is that between device fontsand generic fonts,andM;Device fonts are intrinsic, built into the device.andP;  Most printers haveseveral device fonts stored in ROM somewhere in their intemals.andP;  Device fontsalso include the additional printer fonts stored in ROM cartridges and fontsstored in disk files and downloaded to the printer.andP;  Device fonts are mostoften found in printers rather than in video displays, but some sophisticatedvideo display adapters may also have device fonts.andP;  (Of course, there is atleast one font stored in ROM on most video adapter boards, but this font isused only in character mode and not in graphics mode.)andM;Generic fonts, sometimes referred to as &quot;engine&quot; fonts, are stored in OS/2dynamic link libraries.andP;  These files are usually resource-only libraries thathave a .FON filename extension.andP;  The retail version of OS/2 1.1 comes withthree such generic font files: COURIER.FON, HEL,V.FON, and TIMES.FON, whichcontain Courier, Helvetica, and Times Roman fonts.andP;  Courier is a fixed-pitchfont; Helvetica and Times Roman are proportional fonts.andP;  The system font isstored in DISPLAY.andP;  DLL, the device driver for the video display.andM;(The Helvetica and Times Roman fonts in OS/2 1.1 are not so called, becausethese specific names are registered trademarks of the Linotype Corporation.andO;The names used in OS/2 are &quot;Helv&quot; and &quot;Tms Rmn.&quot;)andM;When a program calls GpiQueryFonts for a printer presentation space, thefunction obtains information about both the device fonts and generic fontsavailable for the printer.andP;  Similarly, calling GpiQueryFonts for a windowpresentation space obtains all the fonts available on the video display.andM;Of course, none of the printer device fonts will be available on the videodisplay.andP;  Moreover, as we'll see shortly, some generic fonts that areavailable for the video display will not be available for some printers.andM;RASTERS AND VECTORSandM;The GPI generic fonts can themselves be subdivided into two categories:raster fonts (also called &quot;image&quot; fonts) and vector fonts (also calledoutline fonts).andP;  The words raster and vector denote different ways in whichthe fonts are stored in the .FON files and rendered on the output device; thedistinction is very important in the field of computer graphics.andM;The word raster was first used in television technology to describe that areaon a cathode-ray tube where the scan lines are drawn.andP;  In graphicsprogramming, however, the word has come to refer to the construction of animage from tiny dots, called pixels or pels (picture elements).andP;  The wordvector comes from mathematics; in computer graphics it refers to theconstruction of an image from lines and filled areas.andM;Graphics output devices are either raster devices or vector devices.andP;  Mostgraphics output devices in common use todayare raster devices.andP;  These includevideo displays, dot matrix printers, and laser printers.andP;  Pen plotters aredifferent: plotters draw lines rather than dots.andP;  Thus, a pioner is a vectoroutput device.andP;  Interestingly enough, in the early days of computergraphics-the mid-1960s-video displays also were vector devices and operatedmuch like oscilloscopes.andP;  The raster display in common use today was a laterdevelopment.andM;We can also use the words vector and raster to describe how a computerprogram stores and renders a graphics image.andP;  The GPI in the PresentationManager supports both vector and raster techniques.andM;The raster graphics approach involves storing an image as a bitmap.andP;  A bitmapis simply a two-dimensional array of bits.andP;  The rows and columns of bitscorrespond to rows and columns of pixels on an output device, such as thevideo display.andP;  In a monochrome bitmap, each bit corresponds to one pixel.andO;Color bitmaps require two or more bits for each pixel.andP;  A program can displaya bitmap on an output device using a bitblt (bit block transfer) operation.andM;The basic problem with using bitmaps, however, is that they are always a setsize (the number of rows and number of pixels in the image).andP;  This is, inturn, tied to a particular device resolution.andP;  You can display a bitmap in asmaller or larger size, but the result is often unsatisfactory.andP;  If you needto shrink a bitmap, for example, you must eliminate whole rows and columns ofpixels from the image, and this may mean the loss of important imageinformation.andP;  To expand the bitmap beyond its original size, ofGpiQuetyFontMetrics, which uses the FONTMETRICS structure to return variousfont dimensions and characteristics.andP;  (The FONTMETRICS structure has 49fields and is the lugest structure in the Presentation Manager API.) TheGpiQuetyTextBox function returns the dimensions of a text string in terms ofthe coordinates of the comers of a box that, if displayed, would enclose thestring.andP;  GpiQueryCharStringPosAt returns an array of increments that indicatethe point at which each character in a string begins.andP;

 Mostgraphics output devices in common use today are raster devices.andP;  Theseinclude video displays, dot matrix printers, and laser printers.andP;  Penplotters are different: plotters draw lines rather than dots.andP;  Thus, aplotter is a vector output device.andP;  Interestingly enough, in the early daysof computer graphics-the niid-1960s-video displays also were vector.andP;  devicesand operated much like oscilloscopes.andP;  The raster display in common use todaywas a later development.andM;We can also use the words vector and raster to describe how a computerprogram stores and renders a graphics image.andP;  The GPI in the PresentationManager supports both vector and raster techniques.andM;The raster graphics approach involves storing an image as a bitmap.andP;  A bitmapis simply a two-dimensional array of bits.andP;  The rows and columns of bitscorrespond to rows and columns of pixels on an output device, such as thevideo display.andP;  In a monochrome bitmap, each bit coresponds to one pixel.andO;Color bitmaps require two or more bits for each pixel.andP;  A program can displaya bitmap on an output device using abitblt (bit block transfer) operation.andM;The basic problem with using bitmaps, however, is that they are always a setsize (the number of rows and number of pixels in the image).andP;  This is, inturn, tied to a particular device resolution.andP;  You can display a bitmap in asmaller or larger size, but the result is often unsatisfactory.andP;  If you needto shrink a bitmap, for example, you must eliminate whole rows and columns ofpixels from the image, and this may mean the loss of important imageinformation.andP;  To expand the bitmap beyond its original size, some rows orcolumns of pixels must be doubled or tripled, perhaps even quadrupled.andP;  Thisproduces a grainy appearance, particularly in curved lines and text.andM;The second approach to storing and rendering graphics objects is known asvector graphics.andP;  In this approach, the image is described as a series ofcoordinate points that denote the starting positions and dimensions ofstraight lines and curves.andP;  FBIed areas are described by an outline ofstraight lines and curves.andP;  Scaling a vector image to another size is atrivial task for a computer.andP;  The GPI can simply apply scaling factors to allthe coordinates.andP;  Rotating or shearing a vector image is also mathematicallyeasy, whereas rotating a bitmap by an arbitrary angle is algorithmically verydifficult.andM;Both raster graphics and vector graphics have a place in graphics progamming.andO;Raster graphics are ideal for storing and rendering digitized photographs,while vector graphics are ideal for architectural drawings.andP;  And, whennecessary, you can even combine raster graphics and vector graphicstechniques.andM;When a program uses raster graphics to display an image on a raster device,the GPI need simply transfer the pixels of the image to the device.andP;  When aprogwn uses vector graphics on a raster device, the GPI must convert thelines and filled areas into a raster image.andP;  This is handied within thedevice driver.andP;  (Some devices, such as PostScript printers and video adaptersequipped with graphics coprocessors, do this work themselves.) For vectordevices such as pen plotters, die device driver can translate a vector imageinto the control sequences understood by the device.andP;  But vector devices weincapable of displaying raster images.andP;  You can't draw a bitmap with aplotter.andM;So far, we've seen that graphics output devices can be categorized as vectoror as raster devices and that a Presentation Manager program can store andrender a graphic on a device using vector or raster techniques.andP;  The GPIgeneric fonts also come in both raster and vector flavors.andM;GPI RASTER FONTSandM;In a raster font, each character is stored as a tiny bitmap.andP;  The rows andcolumns of bits correspond to the pixels that define the letter.andP;  Rasterfonts must be individually designed for a specific font size and for aspecific display resolution.andM;Thus, the three .FON files supplied with OS/2 1.1 contain no less than 60raster fonts.andP;  There are Courier fonts in 8-, 10-, and 12-point sizes, andHelvetica and Times Roman fonts in 8, 10, 12, 14, 18, and 24 points.andP;  (Apoint is 1/72-inch; the point size denotes the height of the characters inthe font.) Each of these fonts is available in four resolutions: those usedby the three IBM video adapters (CGA, EGA, and VGA) and the IBM Proprinter.andO;The VGA fonts are also used for the IBM 8514/A.andP;  The Proprinter fonts areused for other IBM dot matrix printers.andM;A Presentation Manager program can use any of these 60 fonts on the videodisplay, of course.andP;  However, only those fonts designed for the resolution ofthe particular video display will look right.andP;  The others will be too narrowor too wide.andP;  If you have the first version of Borland's SideKick forPresentation Manager, you can see dhs in the NotePad program.andP;  NotePad has abug that causes it to use the Courier font designed for the IBM Proprinter.andO;These characters are too wide for the resolution of the video display.andM;When a Presentation Manager program chooses a raster font to use on the videodisplay or a printer, it should attempt to find a font designed for theresolution of the output device.andP;  If you're interested, the gory details arediscussed in Chapter 5 of my book, Programming the OS12 Presentation Manager(Microsoft Press, 1989).andP;  Interestingly enough, the raster fonts designed forthe video display do not reflect die actual resolution of the display.andP;  TheVGA, for example, has a resolution of about 68 dots per inch, but the VGAraster fonts are designed for a resolution of 96 dpi.andP;  This ensures thatsmall font sizes will retain legibility on the video display.andM;When third-parry manufacturers write device drivers for their own videodisplay adapters or for dot matrix printers, they should also createadditional raster fonts appropriate for the resolution of die device.andP;  Theycan avoid this job only if one of the standard fonts is appropriate.andM;Manufacturers of laser printers can also avoid this job because die devicealways has its own built-in or downloadable fonts.andP;  Besides, as theresolution of a device increases, raster font files can become very large,and eventually unwieldy.andP;  A raster font for the 300-dpi resolution of mostlaser printers typically requires about nine times as much data as needed fora VGA font.andM;The GPI can manipulate die pixels of a raster font to synthesize various textattributes such as boldface, underline, strikeover, and italics.andP;  To createan italic font, die GPI can shift some rows of pixels to the right beforedisplaying the character.andP;  However, this is about the extent of manipulationfeasible with raster fonts.andP;  The GPI cannot scale a raster font to adifferent pixel dimension; if you want a 13-point raster font, you're out ofluck.andM;The Presentation Manager is actually a bit more limited in this respect thanis the Windows program.andP;  Windows can scale raster fonts by increasing thesize in integral multiples.andP;  For example, Windows can make a 48-point fontfrom a 24-point font by doubling each row of bits.andP;  The trade-off involved inusing this method, however, is that it creates a graininess in thecharacters.andP;  It's not nearly a perfect solution, and it still doesn't allowyou to access every possible font size.andP;  GPI VECTOR FONTSandM;Each of the three font files supplied with OS/2 also contains four vectorfonts.andP;  These are Courier, Helvetica, and Times Roman in normal, bold,italic, and bold italic variations.andP;  Vector fonts are stored as a series oflines and curves that are based on a generalized coordinate system.andP;  Whenrendering a character in a vector font, the GPI scales the coordinates to thedesired size and fills the area defined by the outline.andM;It's not necessary for vector fonts to be available in a variety of pointsizes; the GPI can scale the coordinates to the desired size.andP;  You candisplay a 3-point font or a 13-point font or a 28 8-point font from the samevector-font definition.andP;  Nor is it necessary for vector fonts to be designedfor a particular device resolution, since the GPI can adjust for theresolution while scaling the coordinates.andP;  The GPI vector fonts can be usedon any graphics output device that the Presentation Manager supports,including video displays, dot matrix printers, laser printers, and yes, thePM even supports plotters.andM;Because the characters in a vector font are defined as a series ofcoordinates connected by lines and curves, the GPI can manipulate thecoordinates in various ways.andP;  For example, a program can rotate characters sothat text runs diagonally up the page, around a circle, or however you want.andO;The GPI can also fill the interior of a vector font with a pattern or use itfor a clipping area to restrict subsequent drawing to the inside of thecharacter.andM;In other words, you can treat a vectorfont character like any other complexgraphics object.andP;  You've probably seen some demonstrations of fontmanipulation in PostScript, another graphics system that uses vectordefinitions to define fonts.andP;  Virtually everything you can do with fonts inPostScript, you can also do with the GPI vector fonts.andP;  An in-depthdiscussion of the programming considerations involved in manipulating vectorfonts can be found in my article, &quot;Exploring Vector Fonts with the OS/2Presentation Manager,&quot; which appeared in the March, 1989, issue of MicrosoftSystems Journal.andP;  Figure 3 shows four examples of such text manipulations.andO;PERFECT? NOT QUITEandM;Of course, a need for the crazy things you can do with vector fonts doesn'ttum up often in normal everyday work.andP;  Still, it's nice to know that you canmanipulate the fonts like any other vector graphics image.andP;  Scaling, inparticular, allows vector fonts to be independent of device resolution andpoint size, quite unlike the rigid and inflexible raster fonts.andM;Vector fonts represent a marriage of text and graphics that seems to havebeen made in heaven.andP;  You may wonder why we bother with raster fonts at all.andM;Unfortunately, marriages are made on earth, and all of them have at leastsome problems.andP;  The GPI vector fonts do have some severe drawbacks.andP;  In thenext issue I'll discuss these limitations and explore what can be done toimprove GPI vector fonts.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
