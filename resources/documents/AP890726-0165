Among the sharpest barbs at the 1{-hour affair:   _Mayor Edward I. Koch flatly accused Manhattan Borough PresidentDavid Dinkins of tax evasion. Comptroller Harrison J. Goldinsuggested Dinkins was unfit to be mayor because of his four-yeartax lapse in the early 1970s.   _Dinkins and Goldin scored corruption in city agencies,describing Koch's administration as among the most corrupt New Yorkhas known.   _Koch described Goldin as ``the most-investigated comptroller inthe city's history,'' and declared: ``There have been no criminalcharges filed against him _ so far.''   _Former transit chief Richard Ravitch, once a Koch adviser,portrayed the mayor as an egotistical bully who made his aides sitthrough videos about himself. ``We weren't asked for new ideas andnew visions,'' Ravitch said. ``We were asked how he was doing.''   That remark prompted laughter, but onlookers in thestanding-room crowd of 500 more often drew their breaths at thesharpness of the onslaughts. The four men are vying to face aRepublican nominee who is expected to be Rudolph W. Giuliani, thepopular former federal prosecutor.   The debate in a midtown Manhattan auditorium was sponsored bythe New York Post.   Much of the criticism was leveled at Koch, whose third term hasbeen scarred by corruption scandals. Dinkins charged him withheading ``perhaps the most corrupt administration since JimmyWalker,'' the flamboyant, crooked mayor from 1925-32.   Goldin was even harsher, slowly pronouncing the names of sevenKoch commissioners who lost their jobs over charges of wrongdoing.   ``They haul 'em off in manacles. They throw 'em in jail. You'vehad to dismiss them in disgrace. That's a record that you can'tlaugh away. ... It is a record of the worst corruption in amunicipal administration in this city's history. And it's yourfault.''   Koch defended his stewardship of the city and counterattackedwith gusto. He said investigations of Goldin's office had found``incompetence, the appearance of impropriety and grave concernabout his personal integrity.''   The mayor, who seeks a fourth four-year term, was equally directwith Dinkins, the leader in most polls. On Dinkins' failure to filetax returns for four years, Koch said: ``I believe that hecommitted tax evasion.''   Dinkins sought to defuse the issue, noting that he paid his backtaxes with penalties and was not charged criminally. ``No one hasever accused me of tax evasion. Tax evasion is not something ofwhich I am guilty,'' he said.   Ravitch took the least confrontational tone, saying Dinkins was``an honorable man,'' Goldin was ``a good controller,'' and Kochwas ``personally honest'' and an effective mayor in his earlieryears.   But Ravitch _ who never has held elective office _ painted histhree opponents as the agents of a failed city government.   ``The public doesn't want to see the tires on the car rotated.They want the engine changed,'' Ravitch said. He added later: ``Ifyou want more of the same, elect one of these three. But if youwant change, elect me.''   Among his proposals, he said he would add 6,000 police officersto street patrols, paying the $360 million bill by eliminating10,000 workers in other city agencies in which the mayor controlshiring.   Goldin stressed his plan to criminalize drug use, in addition tothe crimes of drug possession and sale. He also urged mandatorydrug treatment at boot-camp style jails for criminals found to haveused drugs.   Dinkins said he would improve a variety of programs includingeducation, health care and drug treatment. He proposed seekingindividual and corporate donations to fund drug-education programsin the schools.   Koch maintained that his record _ including efforts, he said, toroot out corruption at city agencies _ established him as bestqualified. ``If you're a candidate, you talk,'' he said. ``Ifyou're the mayor, you do.''</TEXT></DOC>
