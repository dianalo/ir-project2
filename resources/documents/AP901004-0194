The Bush administration is pushing the new incentives as asubstitute for the capital gains tax cut that congressional leadersrefused to accept. Some of those leaders are suspicious of thesubstitute, which actually includes a small capital gainsreduction.   The proposal is attached to the $500 billion, five-yeardeficit-reduction agreement that President Bush and congressionalleaders reached this week.   The tax break proposal ``has very serious flaws,'' Sen. LloydBentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, saidWednesday. ``I think it will lead to a substantial increase in taxshelters and great abuse.''   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the House Ways andMeans Committee, also has reservations. If the proposals ``aregrowth incentives, he thinks they promise only to help tax sheltersgrow,'' an aide said.   Public outrage about tax sheltering was a major factor in thesweeping income tax overhaul in 1986. Before then, many wealthyindividuals and profitable corporations were able to cut theirtaxes to almost zero by making investments - many with no chance ofsuccess - that offered huge up-front deductions.   A Chamber of Commerce official said the new provisions could bedrawn tightly enough to avoid reviving such tax shelters.   Bush said the plan would provide ``powerful new incentives forproductive investment in the kinds of companies that account formuch of America's job growth.''   The key part would allow a person to deduct 25 percent of thefirst $50,000 invested in a year in a ``small corporation.'' Such acorporation would be defined as one with non-borrowed capital of$50 million or less.   Critics said the definition is so broad it could cover somegiant companies so heavily in debt that stockholder equity fallsbelow the $50 million threshold.   Others noted the possibility a big company could split intosmaller divisions in an effort to attract investors looking for taxbreaks.   ``It's an outrage and probably stands a shot at being knockedout of the budget package,'' said Robert McIntyre, director ofCitizens for Tax Justice, a labor-financed group. ``We don't seethe need to encourage people to invest their money in ways thatdon't make sense for them in the absence of a tax incentive.''   The special deduction and several other small-corporationincentives were written into the budget agreement at theadministration's insistence. That occurred after congressionalleaders refused to accept Bush's proposal to cut the capital gainstax, on grounds that nearly 80 percent of the benefit would go tothose with incomes over $100,000 a year.   Capital gains, the profits from the sale of investments, arefully taxed at the same rates as other income.   One of the proposed incentives is a new capital gains tax cut -albeit a narrow one. It would allow an investor in a smallcorporation to avoid tax on up to half the price for which thestock was sold, as long as it was held at least five years.   Steve Entin, an analyst with the conservative Institute forResearch Into Economics of Taxation, who wants a broad capitalgains cut, said the incentive package is so narrowly drawn that itwould benefit ``only a handful of well-to-do people who couldafford to sink a substantial portion of their money into riskysmall companies.''   Ordinary investors have to diversify to reduce risks, Entinsaid, and there is little in the package for them.</TEXT></DOC>
