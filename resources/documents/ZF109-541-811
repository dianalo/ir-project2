 Jack London,director of Philadelphia, PA's Fox Chase Cancer Center, opted toupgrade his VAXcluster with X terminals as opposed to purchasing aVAX 6000-series computer.andP;  At $50,000, London believes the cost of25 X terminals linked to several RISC computers that run X windowsserver software remains far below the cost of a VAX upgrade.andP;  Inaddition to his commitment to open systems, London chose Xterminals because hospital users primarily type in databasequeries and receive text or image data in return, which keeps RISCserver load at a minimum.andP;

 He could upgrade to a VAX 6000-series computer at acost of $400,000 or more, or use borrowed RISC-based computers and purchasedX terminals as an alternative.andM;He opted for the latter.andM;Today, the hospital is equipped with 25 X terminals, some from NCD inMountain View, Calif., and others from Jupiter Systems of Alameda, Calif.andO;The terminals are linked to several RISC computers, including a DECstation5000, DECstation 3100 and DECstation 2100.andP;  The RISC computers run X windowsserver software to support the X terminals, and also serve as an interfacebetween the X system and the VAXcluster, where the hospital continues tostore patient records.andM;London estimated that he spent $50,000 on the X terminals.andP;  But becauseseveral of the RISC hosts are on loan, he hasn't priced his entire system.andO;He nevertheless noted that the cost remains well below that of a VAX upgrade,given the relatively low cost of RISC workstations compared with a VAX6000-series system.andM;At the same time, London added, he has moved to the cost-effective arena ofopen computing systems.andP;  &quot;We want to keep the open standard,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Wewant to pick and choose&quot; among vendors based on price, rather than beinglocked into a single-vendor solution due to the hardware the hospital alreadyowns.andP;  &quot;We are primarily a DEC shop,&quot; London said, &quot;and DEC is pricey.&quot;andM;London considered diskless workstations, but only briefly.andP;  &quot;We really thinkthat [X terminals] are more cost-effective,&quot; he said.andP;  for displayperformance equal to that of X terminals, diskless worstation costs run muchhigher.andM;London also wanted to use the Open Software Foundation's Motif graphical userinterface rather than windowing systems offered by Sun Microsystems or otherworkstation vendors, again because he believes that Motif is more open.andM;Although London plans to migrate his VT terminal users over to X terminals,he isn't sure how much additional back-end processing the X windows solutionwill require.andP;  &quot;When it comes to these RISC machines,&quot; he said, &quot;we're stilllearning.&quot;andM;One thing london knows for certain, however, is that &quot;you can't support 25 [Xterminals] on a DECstation 5000 with 25MB of memory.&quot;andP;  HE suggested thatadding more memory to the DECstate might allow the workstation to support asmany as 20 terminals (the DECstation 5000 can accommodate as much as 120MB ofmemory), but noted that &quot;we really aren't sure yet.&quot;andM;Back-end power requirements are also highly dependent on the applicationsinvolved, London said.andP;  Because most of the cancer center's terminal userssimply type in database queries and receive text or image data in return, theRISC server load is minimal.andP;  The RISC computers provide the X windows clientfunction as well as pass data between the VAXcluster and the X terminals.andM;London said that moving to X terminals will prove to be a smart fiscal movein the long term as well.andP;  &quot;Twelve months from now, what I will get for my$50,000 is going to support more users,&quot; he said.andP;  He doesn't believe thecenter would get the same price/performance gains from the VAX 6000 series.andM;&quot;If I go to the administration [seeking money to upgradel], I've got to makesure I don't go back for another three years,&quot; he said.andP;  But the smallincremental purchases of additional X windows terminals involved in expandinghis X windows system will more easily meet with top management approval, hesaid.andM;TEACHING XandM;At Boston University, MIS managers are employing X terminals to lower theper-seat costs of academic computers.andM;&quot;We have a fairly large TCP/IP user network, and there are several hundredworkstations spread out on it,&quot; said Ram Rao, manager of communications andnetwork systems for the university.andM;Many university researchers require workstations with desktop-level computingpower, Rao said.andP;  for these users, nothing short of a workstation-classcomputing system will suffice.andM;But in many cases, Rao has found that X terminals can provide a sufficientand cheaper desktop computing alternative.andP;  &quot;[We have] replaced workstationswith X terminals in certain situations where the horsepower from theworkstation is not required, but multiple windows are,&quot; Rao said.andP;  Theswapped workstations are then shuttled to departments that truly need them.andM;In those applications &quot;where you don't need the horsepower of a workstation,&quot;Rao explained, &quot;you are talkig about reducing the cost per seat by at leasthalf.&quot;andM;Accordingly, the university first swapped X terminals with existingworkstations for classroom applications that didn't require workstationcomputing power.andP;  Today, the university employs 50 X terminals, and 300 to400 workstations.andM;X terminal costs averaged about $3,000 per terminal--approximately $2,000less than equivalent workstations, Rao said.andP;  He noted that although Xterminals provide cheaper per-user costs, they offer additional advantages.andM;&quot;Diskless workstations tend to be network-intensive, and they require moreadministrative time,&quot; he explained.andP;  &quot;X terminals take less administrativetime&quot; because they allow MIS managers to centralize system resources &quot;into afairly robust server.&quot;andP;  System maagers therefore needn't be concerned aboutthe particular requirements of individual workstations.andM;At the same time, Rao commented, adding X terminals means that &quot;network useis reduced, so that you can hook more [users] to each network.&quot;andM;According to Rao's research, &quot;workstations do a lot of memory swaps, andthat's eliminated with the X terminals.&quot;andP;  To quantify network loaddifferences, he currently is logging the amount of traffic generated bytypical workstation usage and companing it to the traffic created bycomparable numbers of X terminals.andM;Boston University's X terminals are supported by a Sun Model 4/470, which Raofinds sufficient for the needs of the X terminals users.andP;  Like London of theFx Chase Cancer Center, Rao has found that the amount of server horsepowerrequired depends on the applications involved rather than the X windowssystem.andP;  Currently, the university runs desktop publishing and statisticalapplications under X windows.andM;Server requirements are &quot;decided more by what applications users will berunning&quot; than any other factor, Rao said.andP;  &quot;X terminals are just the accesspoint.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
