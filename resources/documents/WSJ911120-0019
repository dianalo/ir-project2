But an Ohio dermatologist doing research in skinpigmentation cautioned that much more needs to be known aboutthe hormone's effects on the brain and other organs beforeit's used for tanning.</LP><TEXT>   The tanning effect was induced in 16 healthy young malevolunteers by giving each a series of 10 subcutaneousinjections of the hormone for 12 days. The volunteers weresix men who had a history of sunburn and poor tanning and 10who said they tanned easily in sunlight.   During the second week of the injections, the face andneck of each man, and to a lesser degree the arms and legs,began to darken. The tanning of these areas reached a peakone to three weeks after the last injection. By the seventhweek afterward, the tan had begun to fade.   The face, neck and extremities were affected at the dosesused because these areas have the most dense concentration ofpigment-making melanocytes, explained pharmacologist RobertT. Door. He said subsequent experiments at higher dosesproduced tanning in the trunk and buttocks, where there arefew melanocytes, the skin cells that make melanin, the darkpigment responsible for dark skin.   The volunteers had been asked to use a sun blockingointment with a sun-protection factor, or SPF, number of 30,the researchers said, but they weren't sure how stringentlythe volunteers used the ointment. However, a second group of10 volunteers who also received injections of inert saltwater and were asked to use the ointment during the same 12days failed to show any signs of skin darkening.   The experiment was carried out in Tucson by a team ofUniversity of Arizona dermatologists, anatomists, chemistsand radiation experts. The team, headed by dermatologistNorman Levine, reported the results in this week's issue ofthe Journal of the American Medical Association.   The researchers noted that a method of inducing a tanwithout sunlight would help prevent skin cancer inlight-skinned individuals who are most prone to sun-inducedskin cancer.   The synthetic hormone used was almost identical to naturalalpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, or MSH. The naturalhormone had been found to stimulate melanocytes. Injectionsof natural MSH, however, aren't very effective at triggeringskin tanning. So the Arizona chemists synthesized a variationof MSH that they said is 1,000 times more active than thenatural hormone and has a prolonged effect.   Patents on the composition and use of the synthetichormone are owned by the university. Until recently, Johnsonandamp; Johnson, a health-care products company, supported theresearch through the Robert Wood Johnson Research Institute,and the company's Ortho division had an option on licensingthe synthetic hormone. However, the company dropped theproject at the beginning of this year, the Arizonaresearchers said.   A Jandamp;J spokesman said the company dropped its option on thetanning hormone &quot;after weighing the likely commercialpotential against the long and complicated research anddevelopment process.&quot;   In an accompanying editorial, University of Cincinnatidermatologist James J. Norlund cautioned that natural MSH hasother roles in the body beyond inducing pigmentation of theskin. Various experiments show it also is a chemicaltransmitter of nerve impulses, that it can trigger productionof other hormones, and that it is involved in inflammation.Some human experiments have indicated it can improve verbalmemory.   MSH &quot;needs to be studied much more intensively,&quot; andclinical studies of its tanning properties &quot;should be delayeduntil the multiplicity of other effects of MSH are betterunderstood,&quot; he wrote.</TEXT></DOC>
