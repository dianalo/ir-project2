(case study of a local area network on twistedpair wire)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Newton, Harry.andM;</AUTHOR><SUMMARY>The installation of a local area network (LAN) at TeleconnectMagazine's Southhampton, PA, sales office is documented.andP;  The LANselected was from Novell, and the Ethernet network interface cards(NICs) from Everex.andP;  Because the LAN was being implemented in apre-existing office, 10Base-T over shielded twisted-pair telephonewiring was selected as the technology.andP;  A 10Base-T concentratorfrom Synoptics Communications was selected as the hub.andP;  The actualprocess of installing the Novell software is documented, and somewiring constraints are discussed.andP;  A list of mistakes encounteredin the process, along with ways of avoiding them, is alsoprovided.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Local Area NetworksCase StudyInstalling a ComputerTwisted PairGuidelines.andO;Feature:   illustrationphotograph.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>WIRING TIPSandM;While 10Base-T is often thought to be able to use existing wire, if s notalways the case.andP;  If the wiring is older than seven years, you might have aProblem.andP;  And attenuation and crosstalk usually narrows the plausibledistance of wire runs to 100 meters.andP;  All wire must also be shielded andtwisted.andM;The importance of the wire plant shouldn't be underestimated.andP;  You shouldchoose it as carefully as YOU choose the server and other aspects of thenetworkandM;We wanted to put a LAN in our Southampton, PA, sales office.andP;  We live off ourLANs in New York.andP;  The sellers needed one too.andM;Our idea was to put TeleMagic (see testdrive in March, 1991, TELECONNECT) onall the sellers' PCs and run it off a central computer - what's known in thelocal area network business as a file server.andP;  There are enormous advantages.andO;The sellers still keep their own sales contacts (their databases on theirPCs), but they can cover for each other easier (see what's on otherdatabases) and the administration of such tasks as mailing, sorting,checking, etc.andP;  is made much easier.andP;  And the whole thing can be accessedfrom New York (over our own WAN - more about that another time).andM;I chose a Novell network running with Everex Ethernet cards.andP;  Mere are dozensof other networks.andP;  But Novell dominates.andP;  Our accounting LAN uses Novell andit has given us no trouble in three years.andM;I chose Everex cards because our experience with the company's computers - wehave over 30 - has been good.andP;  We have tried others and found Everex machineswork best.andM;The &quot;normal&quot; way to install a Novell LAN is using coaxial cable looping fromone PC to the next.andP;  This is called a &quot;bus.&quot; It's very hard to install a busin an office already built.andP;  Gerry was adamant about not tearing up hisbeautiful walls.andM;Apparently there are others like him, because the hottest way to install aLAN today is on &quot;normal&quot; twisted pair 10Base-T, a standard that was handeddown last fall.andP;  Using 10Base-T, we were up and running in minutes.andO;Literally.andM;At the center you need a 10Base-T concentrator.andP;  It costs $1,500 to $2,000for 12 ports.andP;  For my money there's only one 10Base-T concentrator worth itssalt - from SynOptics Communications, Santa Clara, CA.andP;  We have their Model2800 with 12 ports.andP;  It was the easiest and most painless installation of anycomplex equipment we've ever installed.andM;Installing a Novell LAN is not as easy.andP;  You probably need someone who's doneit before.andP;  We put in a Novell  286 version 2.15.andP;  I'm told the newer Novell 386 is easier (and I might add that the complexity of putting in a Novell LANhas to do with its power, not its unreliability).andM;Ken Lockie helped us install the system.andP;  He wrote a few words about theadventure, below:andM;There are several ways to install Novell's Netware.andP;  The medium available tome was floppy disk.andP;  The easiest way to install is from a hard drive.andP;  Thiseliminates much of the diskette swapping, but it has to be done from aworkstation or non-dedicated server.andP;  Installing Novell SFT 2.15 throughNetgen, using the floppy disk method, the installer is prompted for thedriver disks.andP;  These diskettes must have certain volume labels to be acceptedby Netgen.andM;These drivers allow the  OS  (Operating System) to be custom configured forthe specific type of Network Interface Card being used and the specific typeof hard drive that the OS will reside on.andP;  Also, in this configurationprocess, the available resources are described LPT1, LPT2, COM1, etc.andM;Since these devices will occupy certain areas of ROM, configuring all thesystem resources must occur without memory conflict.andP;  So the default settingson the NIC (network interface card, the 10Base-T card in each machine) andcontroller card need to be confirmed to be in the default position asspecified in the documentation.andM;Usually, defaults can be assumed.andP;  But not always.andP;  I hit a snag.andP;  Afterlinking and configuring the software according to the defaults in thedocumentation, trying to install the software was a fail.andP;  When Netware wentto find the drive I'd described, the system suspended.andP;  Although the utilitydiskette could find the drive, the OS couldn't.andM;I focused on the server drive, controller card and other resource sets.andO;After taking off the casing I matched the model numbers on the documents withthe equipment.andP;  It all matched.andP;  Next I checked the jumpers and switches oneach card and that's where I discovered, barely visible, under the ribbonconnector that the base memory jumper (a four pin jumper J5 on the 8110Adapter Card) was configured for a non default base memory address.andM;I had to remove the ribbon connector and position the first jumper for thedefault.andP;  After this, to my great satisfaction, Netware found the drive andbegan a disk analysis using the Compsurf utility.andP;  After running Compsurf forseveral hours and seeing the drive pounded with read and writes over andover.andP;  I downloaded the Operating System from the Netgen menu.andM;Novell SFF 2.15 installs as a dedicated server only (you can't use it as aworkstation).andP;  When the OS is finally loaded, the Novell software cannot beaccessed from the server.andP;  The server is dedicated.andP;  It's in Console modeonly.andM;Installing and configuring the NIC card for the server is straight forward.andO;Remove the case, check the jumpers on the card for default positions and dropit in an empty slot on the motherboard.andM;Since this network was 10Base-T, an FJ-45 from the workstation plugged intothe hub SynOptics concentrator) and similarly the server connected.andP;  10BaseTwiring has its send and receive on wires 1, 2, 3 and 6.andP;  Normal twisted pairwiring has pairs on 1,8 2,7 3,6 and 4,5.andP;  Conveniently, this hub does thiscross connect for you, so no rewiring is necessary.andP;  Having achievedconnectivity you are then able to log into the server using Log-inSupervisor.andP;  From here, customizing user log-in scripts and path mapping arethe fun parts.andM;MAJOR MISTAKES WE MADE INSTALLING THIS LANandM;1.andP;  Not checking the jumper settings in the Everex file server.andM;2.andP;  Not labeling cables, connectors, jacks, etc.andP;  Everything should belabeled.andP;  Don't use Avery labels, which peel off.andP;  Use something permanentBest bet-.andP;  A Sharpie permanent black magic marker.andP;  We had to install ournetwork on wiring off a data PBX, which had 'enjoyed' many moves and changes- none of which had been documented.andM;3.andP;  Not having a written plan of how we wired the place up.andP;  (See point 2.) Awritten plan helps you plan  (yes, that four-letter word) what you're doing.andM;4.andP;  Underestimating the time it takes to get all the  stuff.&quot; You can't getit all in one place.andP;  And someone's always out of something you need.andM;5.andP;  Not being careful enough with the prices.andP;  It's amazing how many of those&quot;discount&quot; catalog places aren't.andP;  Prices vary all over the board.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
