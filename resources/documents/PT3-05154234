The housing is then lowered to the well platform or ground and      the flame is cooled by a coolant/flame retardant to cause the ignition      point of the flame to rise above a flapper valve in the housing. The      flapper valve is closed by remote actuation to separate the flame from the      fuel flowing from the wellhead. The unburned fuel is vented from the      housing and the flame is extinguished by the coolant/flame retardant. </PAL></ABST><BSUM> <PAC>  FILED OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The present invention relates to fire extinguishing apparatus and methods,      and more particularly to an apparatus for and a method of extinguishing      fires at the wellhead of a well, such as an oil or gas well. </PAR><PAC>  DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART </PAC><PAR>  The art of extinguishing oil and gas well fires has become highly developed      over the years, but there are still relatively few apparatus and methods      that are used with success. One known technique for extinguishing oil well      fires involves detonating an explosive device directly above the wellhead      to consume all the oxygen supporting combustion of the wellhead fire. </PAR><PAR>  It has also been proposed to equip an oil well with an in-situ fire      extinguishing apparatus which may be remotely activated or automatically      activated by temperature sensitive devices at the wellhead. U.S. Pat. Nos.      3,887,011 to Dokes et al. and 4,337,831 to Thaxton are examples of such      prior art apparatus. The Dokes et al. apparatus is temperature activated      by a fusible link which, when melted, operates a valve arrangement to      smother the fire and bypass the oil to an isolated exhaust pipe. The      Thaxton apparatus employs an apparatus mounted on the well platform which      comprises a plurality of tanks of fire extinguishing material and a      valving system adapted to be manually activated to cause the fire      extinguishing material to flow into the wellhead. </PAR><PAR>  U.S. Pat. Nos. 1,520,288 to Featherstone and 1,857,788 to Murphy disclose      oil well fire extinguishing apparatus that are transported to an oil well      fire and are lowered or dropped into place over the fire so that fire      extinguishing material can be injected into a housing surrounding the fire      to extinguish the same. The Featherstone device comprises a cone-shaped      body with a double-walled reservoir containing a fire extinguishing      chemical. The body is placed over the wellhead with a boom and cables and      two valved outlets relieve the pressure generated by the burning oil. A      pressurized fluid is applied to the reservoir to blow out soft plugs in      the interior reservoir wall and discharge the fire extinguishing material      into the interior of the body. The Murphy apparatus is a large, complex      and heavy structure that is brought into position adjacent an oil well      fire on several tracks laid for the purpose. When in place, the Murphy      apparatus is tilted over onto the wellhead to force a plug of water      upwardly through a conical aperture to break the flow of combustible      material from the well. If the fire is not extinguished by that step, a      valving arrangement may be operated to isolate the flame and draw off the      well products. </PAR><PAR>  It would be desirable to provide a relatively simple wellhead fire      extinguisher apparatus that could be lowered in place over an oil well      fire and which is adapted to be remotely and automatically operable to      cool the fire to separate the ignition point of the flame from the      wellhead, then starve the flame of fuel and bypass the unburned fuel to a      vent line. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  In view of the shortcomings of the prior art devices, as well as other      disadvantages of the prior art not specifically mentioned above, it should      be apparent that there still exists a need in the art for a simple, yet      effective, wellhead fire extinguisher and method of extinguishing a well      fire. It is, therefore, a primary objective of this invention to fulfill      that need by providing a wellhead fire extinguisher that is characterized      by a simplicity of design and ease of operation not possible with the      prior art devices. </PAR><PAR>  The wellhead fire extinguisher of the invention comprises a portable flame      containment housing including a wellhead chamber adapted to rest on the      well platform or the ground or surface around the wellhead and an      elongated tubular flame chamber connected to and communicating with the      upper end of the wellhead chamber. A pneumatically-operated flapper valve      is mounted inside the wellhead chamber and is pivotable upwardly to close      off the flame chamber from the wellhead chamber. The tubular flame chamber      has an angled or inclined outlet to direct the flame, heat, and unburned      fuel away from the equipment and personnel in the area around the      wellhead. </PAR><PAR>  Both the wellhead chamber and the flame chamber are provided with a      plurality of inlets for a coolant and/or a chemical flame retardant which      is delivered to the inlets via flexible lines. A fuel vent line is      connected to the wellhead chamber and is provided with a pressure relief      valve which opens at a predetermined pressure to vent unburned fuel away      from the wellhead. </PAR><PAR>  According to the method aspects of the present invention, the portable      wellhead fire extinguisher of the invention is suspended from a crane or      other lifting device and the flapper valve is pneumatically operated to      its fully open position. The flame containment housing is then lowered      over the burning fire at the wellhead so that the flame passes up through      the wellhead chamber and flame chamber. The housing is held in a position      spaced a short distance above the wellhead platform so that the wellhead      chamber and flame chamber function in a manner similar to a chimney, that      is, in a manner to create an updraft sufficient to draw all the surface      fire surrounding the wellhead into the containment housing and thereby      make it easier to extinguish any remaining ground fire. The housing is      then lowered so that it rests on the well platform or the ground and the      flame passes out through the angled flame chamber outlet. </PAR><PAR>  Next, a coolant and/or a flame retardant is admitted to the inlets in the      wellhead chamber to cool the flame and cause the point of ignition to move      upwardly past the flapper valve and into the flame chamber. If a greater      cooling effect is necessary to move the ignition point upwardly, the      coolant and/or the flame retardant may be introduced into the flame      chamber as well. The flapper valve is then operated to its closed position      which separates the flame ignition point from the fuel and increases the      pressure in the wellhead chamber. When the pressure increases to a      predetermined point, the relief valve in the vent line automatically opens      to divert the fuel from the wellhead and flame chambers. </PAR><PAR>  Finally, if the coolant/flame retardant has not already been introduced, it      is admitted to the flame chamber to complete extinction of the flame. </PAR><PAR>  With the foregoing and other objectives, advantages, and features of the      invention that will become herein-after apparent, the nature of the      invention may be more clearly understood by reference to the following      detailed description of the invention, the appended claims and to the      several views illustrated in the attached drawings. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a side elevation view of the wellhead fire extinguisher apparatus      of the present invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is a front elevation view of the wellhead fire extinguisher      apparatus of the invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is a top plan view of the wellhead fire extinguisher apparatus of      the present invention; and </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 is a cross-sectional view of the apparatus of the invention taken      along line 4--4 of FIGS. 2 and 3; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 5 is a cross-sectional view similar to FIG. 4 illustrating the flame      containment housing positioned above the wellhead; and </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 6 is a cross-sectional view similar to FIG. 4 illustrating the flame      containment housing lowered to the surface surrounding the wellhead. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  Referring now in detail to the drawings, there is illustrated in FIGS. 1-3,      front elevation, side elevation, and top plan views of the wellhead fire      extinguisher apparatus of the invention which is designated generally by      reference numeral 10. The apparatus 10 includes a flame containment      housing 12 comprising a wellhead chamber 14 and a tubular flame chamber      16. The wellhead chamber 14 is mounted to a heavy support base 18.      Preferably, the components of housing 12 are made of welded steel      construction. For a typical oil field application, the flame chamber 16      has a diameter of about 20 inches and the wellhead chamber 14 has      dimensions of about 4 feet by 6 feet and a height of about 5 feet.      Although the wellhead chamber 14 is disclosed herein in the form of a      rectangular parallelepiped, it may also have a cylindrical shape with a      diameter of 5 to 6 feet or any other suitable shape. </PAR><PAR>  The flame chamber 16 has an angled outlet pipe 20 which is inclined from      the longitudinal axis A of chamber 16 by approximately      15.degree.-45.degree., preferably about 20.degree.-25.degree., and most      preferably about 22.degree., for a purpose to be described. The lower end      of the flame chamber 16 passes through the top wall 22 of the wellhead      chamber 14 and is in fluid communication therewith. </PAR><PAR>  Referring to the cross-sectional view of FIG. 4, a flapper valve 24 is      pivotable about a shaft 26 to a closed position as shown in FIG. 4 and      from the closed position to an open position shown in dashed lines 28 in      FIG. 4. A pneumatic actuator 30 mounted to the exterior of wellhead      chamber 14 is connected to shaft 26 and is operable to pivot the flapper      valve 24 between its open and closed positions. A pneumatic line 32 is      connected to the actuator 30 from a source (not shown) of pressurized air. </PAR><PAR>  The wellhead chamber 14 has four (4) inlets 34 for introducing a coolant      and/or flame retardant, such as water and carbon dioxide (CO.sub.2).      Similarly, the flame chamber has a plurality of inlets 36 for the coolant      and/or flame retardant which are interconnected by a series of pipes or      manifolds 38. Preferably, a remote actuating means 35 is provided for      remotely operating the introduction of the coolant and/or flame retardant.      The wellhead chamber 14 also has a fuel vent pipe or outlet 40 in which a      butterfly-type pressure relief valve 42 is disposed. The pressure relief      valve 42 is set to open when a predetermined pressure exists in outlet 40. </PAR><PAR>  Referring now to FIGS. 5 and 6, the apparatus 10 operates in the following      manner. If a well fire occurs, the apparatus 10 is suspended from a crane      or other heavy lifting apparatus by means of suitable hangers (not shown).      Although not illustrated in detail, flexible coolant/fire retardant lines      are connected between a valved source and the inlets 34 and manifolds 38      in the wellhead and flame chambers 14, 16, respectively, and between the      fuel vent pipe 40 (FIGS. 2 and 3) and a fuel reservoir. </PAR><PAR>  When the apparatus 10 is ready to be lowered over the burning wellhead W,      the pneumatic actuator 30 for the flapper valve 24 is operated to move the      flapper valve 24 to the open position (FIG. 5). As the apparatus is      lowered, the well flame F is directed to flow into the wellhead chamber 14      and flame chamber 16 since the flapper valve 24 is open and the flame      ignition point P is located in the wellhead chamber 14. This flowthrough      of the flame and burning fuel results in no, or only a small, increase in      pressure in the wellhead chamber so that the apparatus can continue to be      lowered over the wellhead W until it is positioned a short distance above      the wellhead platform or the ground S. The flame and fuel flowing through      the apparatus 10 functions to create a chimney-like updraft effect in the      apparatus so as to draw any flame surrounding the wellhead into the flame      containment housing 12. </PAR><PAR>  After the updraft effect is established, the apparatus 10 is lowered to the      well platform or ground S (FIG. 6) and coolant/flame retardant is      introduced into the wellhead chamber 14 via inlets 34 (as shown by arrows      33) and, if desired, the flame chamber 16 via manifolds 38 and inlets 36      (as shown by arrows 37). This cooling of the flame causes the flame      ignition point P to move upwardly into the flame chamber 16. When that      happens, the flapper valve is actuated to the closed position (24 in FIG.      6) thus separating the flame from the fuel flowing into wellhead chamber      14. Fuel flow into chamber 14 increases the pressure in the wellhead      chamber to the predetermined pressure at which relief valve 42 (FIGS. 2      and 3) opens and the fuel flows out of the chamber 14 through outlet 40 as      shown by the arrow 41 in FIG. 3. Since the flame is confined to the flame      chamber 16 and the fuel supply is cut off from chamber 16, the flame will      eventually extinguish. If desired, coolant/flame retardant can continue to      be applied to flame chamber 16 to more rapidly extinguish the flame. When      the flame is fully extinguished the wellhead area is cooled with water      and/or CO.sub.2 to prevent restarting of the fire because of hot      components around the wellhead. </PAR><PAR>  As best seen in FIG. 1, the angled portion 20 of the flame chamber 16      advantageously directs the flame and unburned fuel in a direction that      prevents unburned hot fuel from falling directly back onto the apparatus      10. Such diversion of the combustible matter also permits personnel to      approach the wellhead from a particular direction (from the left as seen      in FIG. 1) without being subjected to a shower of burning fuel. </PAR><PAR>  Although certain presently preferred embodiments of the invention have been      described herein, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art to which      the invention pertains that variations and modifications of the described      embodiment may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the      invention. Accordingly, it is intended that the invention be limited only      to the extent required by the appended claims and the applicable rules of      law. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  What is claimed is: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
