<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-30-0487 </DOCNO><TEXT>In July 1985 the authors performed an infrared solar-occultation experimentwith a balloon-borne, non-scanning, multi-detector grating spectrometer.From the data, the authors retrieved simultaneous mixing-ratio profilesof ozone, water vapor, nitric acid, and CF{sub 2}Cl{sub 2} between 12and 35 km. The retrieved ozone and water-vapor profiles were comparedwith concurrent in-situ measurements with electrochemical concentrationcells (ECC's) and frost-point hygrometers, respectively. The retrieved-ozoneprofile was in good agreement with the correlative data. The retrievedvalues of water-vapor-mixing ratio, while close in magnitude to the correlativemeasurements, differed in their altitude dependence. Although the authorshad no concurrent in-situ data for nitric acid and CF{sub 2}Cl{sub 2},the retrieved profiles were consistent with measurements in the literature.</TEXT></DOC>
