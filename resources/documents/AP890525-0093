WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Former Housing Secretary Samuel Pierce todaydefended his role in a subsidy program under investigation forfavoring well-connected Republicans, saying he tried to kill theprogram and suggesting that Democrats also benefited from it.   Pierce's comments before a congressional committee provoked anangry, sometimes shouted exchange with Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass.,who charged that the former Reagan administration officials wastrying to ``deflect some of the blame'' by making ``irresponsiblestatements'' he could not back up.   Pierce's appearance before a House Government Operationssubcommittee marked his first public comment since an investigativereport sharply criticized the management of a Department of Housingand Urban Development program that provided indirect subsidies forrehabilitation of privately owned low-income housing projects.   Current HUD Secretary Jack Kemp suspended further awards underthe program pending a review.   Pierce, who headed HUD throughout all eight years of the Reaganadministration, testified that he recommended Congress kill theso-called mod-rehab program.   He acknowledged that department officials used their discretionin awarding subsidies to selected developers, but he said that wasbecause Congress in 1984 waived requirements specifying fair-shareallocation procedures.   The HUD inspector general said his audit found a pattern inwhich former department officials and other well-connectedRepublicans received a large share of project awards either asdevelopers or as consultants to developers. Among those cited wasformer Interior Secretary James Watt, who was reported receiving a$300,000 consulting fee on a Maryland project.   Pierce said the report failed to mention Democrats whobenefited. He added: ``It should be interesting to see how muchthose affiliated with the Democratic Party benefited from thisprogram, since strong _ and I am sure very intelligent _ DemocraticCongresses repeatedly appropriated funding ... when the Republicanadministration repeatedly sought to terminate it.''   Pressed by Frank, Pierce said he believed Democrats benefitedbut could not name any.   ``You've made an irreponsible staement and you're trying tofilibuster your way out of it,'' Frank charged.   Subcommittee Chairman Tom Lantos, D-Calif., read from a memo hesaid the inspector general sent Pierce in 1988 warning him ofproblems in the program.   Pierce said he had previously altered the selection process anddid not respond to the inspector general's suggestion because theearlier changes needed time to work. He said he followed advice ofother aides.   ``Those people know something too,'' Pierce said. ``Theinspector general is not God.''   Pierce said he met with Watt on the Maryland project. But hesaid he referred Watt to the appropriate office at HUD and told himonly that ``we'd look very carefully at his project.''   ``No promises were made to him. How he got his money, I didn'task him that,'' Pierce said. ``Whatever he said, I really paid verylittle attention to him.''   The developer who hired Watt on the Maryland project told thesubcommittee that Watt was hired ``to move and unsnarl thebureaucracy throughout the development process.''   ``Mr. Watt can get phone calls returned at HUD. I can't,'' saidJudith S. Siegel, president of Landex Corp.</TEXT></DOC>
