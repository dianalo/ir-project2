(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Employees of a grocery store are losingpatience with the continuing escapades of a squirrel that has takenup residence amid the coffee cakes, doughnuts and hot dog rolls.   The critter has run up a $25 tab at the Farm Fare IGA over thelast two weeks.   Employees took to shooing the squirrel outside, but it keepscoming back.   ``It was a joke the first couple of times, but now he isbeginning to be a problem,'' said store manager Dick Emery.   The squirrel once jumped over a woman's shoulder as she reachedfor a box of rice, leaving her shrieking as it high-tailed it upthe aisle.   ``I came in one morning and there he was, just sitting down ontop of the wine coolers in the front of the store,'' Emery said.``It was almost as if he was waiting for the chase to begin.''   Fritz Sabbow, executive director of the local Humane Society,said the only way to catch the squirrel will be with a net ``and itwon't be easy. They are pretty quick.''</TEXT></DOC>
