But the leaders, wrapping up their one-day summit, gave no clueson whether either side had put forth fresh proposals that wouldadvance the twin sets of talks.   Secretary of State James A. Baker III later raised thepossibility that negotiators might drop the contentious issue ofplacing limits on combat aircraft to win early agreement on cuttingconventional weapons in Europe.   ``There's quite a bit of difference between us still onaircraft, and it may be that ... we'll have to proceed witheverything we can do ... and save aircraft for a later time,''Baker said in an interview on Cable News Network's Newsmaker Sundayprogram.   But he said no final decision has yet been made.   The issue of aircraft ceilings is the most difficult forEast-West negotiators bargaining on a treaty to slash troops, tanksand other conventional, or non-nuclear, arms in Europe.   At a joint news conference, Bush said he and Gorbachev ``vowedthat we would encourage our negotiators to move forward morerapidly on both the strategic arms treaty and the conventionalforce agreement.''   Gorbachev added that the officials agreed they would ``makefresh efforts to give further instructions'' to their bargainers.   Both said they were hopeful agreement could be reached by theend of the year. But others have said the slow pace of thenegotiations has raised concern the deadline could be missed.   Baker said the leaders stressed the importance of gaining aconventional arms treaty before the opening of a 35-nation summitof the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. Frenchofficials already have begun plans to hold the gathering Nov. 19-21in Paris.   Bush has said he will not attend the summit unless the treaty iswrapped up by then.   The second set of negotiations, designed to win a Strategic ArmsReduction Treaty, would slash the superpowers' holdings oflong-range nuclear weapons by about 30 percent. It would be thefirst-ever negotiated cut in this category of weapons.   The Conventional Forces in Europe talks have been on a fasttrack since they opened in March 1989 between negotiators for the16 nations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the sevenof the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.   They were designed to bring both sides to equal ceilings in mainbattle tanks, armored combat vehicles, artillery, troops, combataircraft and attack helicopters. The West's aim is to cripple theSoviets' ability to mount a lightning attack on European countries.   Negotiators for the 23 nations have reached agreement onnumerical ceilings and definitions for equipment covered in onlytwo areas _ main battle tanks and armored combat vehicles. They areconsidered close on artillery and not too far apart on attackhelicopters.   But they have made little headway in their talks on reducingcombat aircraft because of sharp differences over what should becovered in that category.   The United States wants to include in the count planes that arebased on land but are used in naval operations. The Kremlin hassaid no. It has offered proposals that would exempt large numbersof land-based naval planes from the accord.   Baker said the United States was not willing to put off theaircraft issue unless its NATO allies agreed.   ``If they would join in, we would have to give someconsideration to that, because we think it's important to lock inthe other elements of the treaty,'' he told the CNN interviewers.   The arms bargaining also has snagged over reductions in troopsin Europe.   Moscow and Washington settled on a plan earlier this year totrim their forces to 195,000 for each side in central Europe, withthe United States retaining an additional 30,000 in Britain andsouthern Europe.   But it is unclear whether that accord still holds.   A NATO official, speaking in advance of the weekend summit, saidthe Soviets have said the upheavals in Eastern Europe have made thetroop caps outdated. With the diminished military threat, thenumber of soldiers stationed in central Europe by the superpowersmight well be below those limits.   During the summer, the Soviets mentioned a possible ceiling of70,000 to 80,000 soldiers for each superpower in Europe, said theofficial, who demanded anonymity. But they recently renewed theirinterest in the earlier cap of 195,000 troops.   ``They have put up so many proposals now that we're uncertainwhat one they really want,'' said a Western diplomat in Vienna,where the negotiations are being held.   The two sides so far have agreed to limit main battle tanks to20,000 for each side, a cap that will require the Soviet Union toget rid of tens of thousands of the heavy giants in Europe.   They also have decided to cap armored combat vehicles at 30,000on each side.</TEXT></DOC>
