Spain and the United States signed a new eight-year agreement inDecember that requires withdrawal of 72 U.S. F-16 fighter bombersby 1992. However, the pact allows continued U.S. use of threemilitary bases and nine communications posts.   Italy has agreed to provide a new home for the planes at Crotone.   Sunday's demonstrators walked seven miles from the Spanishcapital to Torrejon de Ardoz, site of a U.S. air base. Theydemanded dismantling of that and other U.S. bases and protested theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization.   The protest was organized by anti-NATO activists in Madrid, theSpanish Communist Party, leftist labor unions, and pacifist groups.They estimated the crowd at 25,000, but police said only 5,000people took part.   No incidents were reported. It was the ninth year in a row sucha demonstration has been held.   The new accord on bases reduces the allowed number of U.S.troops in Spain from 12,545 to 8,078.   Spain became a NATO member in May 1982, but its military remainsoutside the joint command of the Western alliance.</TEXT></DOC>
