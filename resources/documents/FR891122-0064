Near Newfield, New York, wherethe new line will not parallel existing pipe, new right-of-way is necessary.Any environmental disturbance related to the proposed facilities will beof short duration and minimal impact, CNG states, and CNG submits thatapproval of this application will not constitute a major federal actionsignificantly affecting the human environment.CNG states that the cost of these two new facilities, the pipeline andMandamp;R station, is estimated to be $7,975,600 exclusive of filing fees.These facilities will be financed from funds on hand or will be obtainedfrom CNG's parent company, Consolidated Natural Gas Company.Under its proposal, CNG states that CNG will be rendering transportationservices for five LDC customers who are subscribing to storage at the newSteuben Gas Storage pool. These five customers are:<ITAG tagnum="15">Public Service Electric andamp; Gas Company,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Commonwealth Gas Company,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Elizabethtown Gas Company,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">New Jersey Natural Gas Supply Company,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">City of Union, South Carolina.</ITAG>CNG states that as of this filing, executed copies of the transportationagreements had not been received by CNG from all parties. Receipt of executedagreements is believed imminent, and they will be filed immediately uponreceipt.CNG states that the points of receipts and delivery to and from CNG willbe identical for all of the above customers except Commonwealth. CNG willreceive the shipper's gas for transportation from either Transco or TexasEastern at their respective Leidy interconnection with CNG. CNG will thendeliver the gas to Woodhull for receipt by Steuben and, ultimately, injectioninto the storage pool. During withdrawal periods CNG will receive gas fromSteuben at Woodhull and deliver to Transco at Leidy.CNG states that the receipt and delivery points differ from those abovefor shipper Commonwealth Gas. CNG will receive Commonwealth's gas at theMorrisville connection between CNG and Tennessee in Madison County, NewYork, or at the existing connection between CNG and Tennessee at Ellisburg,Potter County, Pennsylvania. Commonwealth's gas will then be deliveredto Steuben at Woodhull for injection. Withdrawal gas will be received byCNG at Woodhull and redelivered to Tennessee at Morrisville for Commonwealth'saccount.CNG states that is has existing sales and/or transportation agreements,besides the draft service agreements being filed with its application,with several of the Steuben customers. CNG states that the service beingproposed by this application is in addition to that contemplated in theexisting service agreements, and an incremental rate is necessitated bythe facilities CNG must construct to perform this new service. CNG statesthat the customers have agreed to an incremental rate design as depictedbelow.The following chart depicts the maximum daily transportation quantities(MDTQ) at the injection and withdrawal points of receipt, the maximum annualtransportation quantity (MATQ) and the monthly demand charge for each customer:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>5,L2,tp0,i1,s100,23,23,23,23</C> <H1> </H1><H1>MDTQ injection (Dt)</H1><H1>MDTQ withdrawal (Dt)</H1><H1>MATQ (Dt)</H1><H1>Monthly demand charge</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">New Jersey Natural<D>7,250</D><D>11,044</D><D>2,009,000</D><D>$24,162</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Elizabethtown<D>3,625</D><D>5,522</D><D>1,004,500</D><D>12,018</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Public Service<D>24,686</D><D>30,769</D><D>6,840,645</D><D>74,246</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Commonwealth<D>9,062</D><D>11,295</D><D>2,511,250</D><D>27,256</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">City of Union<D>326</D><D>497</D><D>90,405</D><D>1,087</D><R>n,sandCx.3;</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">Total</ITAG><D>44,949</D><D>59,127</D><D>12,455,800</D><D>$138,832</D></ITAG>The rate which CNG is proposing for this transportation service, as shownabove, is a one-part demand rate, payable regardless of actual quantitiestransported. It is an incremental rate, based upon the cost of completingthe Steuben Project and the pro rate share of capacity subscribed for byeach customer. Revenue anticipated under the rate design fully compensatesCNG for the costs of the project. Therefore, CNG's existing customers willnot be required to subsidize this service in any way.As stated previously, Steuben has already filed for a certificate authorizingit to render the storage service. CNG states that Transco may also be filingan application to certify its proposed service under this project. CNGstates that Commonwealth will currently be shipping gas on Tennessee'ssystem on an interruptible basis; however, in the event that a firm transportationagreement is reached in the future, Tennessee may be required to also filefor a certificate. CNG states that Steuben represented in its applicationthat it has filed with the state of New York for all necessary state authorizations,and CNG will be doing so in the near future. To the best of CNG's knowledgeno other applications are necessary by any of the parties to implementthis service.<T3>Comment date:</T3> December 7, 1989 in accordance with Standard ParagraphF at the end of the notice.<ITAG tagnum="84">6.
