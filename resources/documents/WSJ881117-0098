Some executives at the financial services firm speculate that the new strategy will mean many senior-level employees will lose their jobs. About 350 employees work on the Merrill network.    The move is similar in some respects to Bankers Trust New York Co.'s decision last summer to sell several departments, and transfer related employees to a Xerox Corp. division in a cost-cutting move. Bankers Trust had hired Xerox to manage various office services.    Merrill has asked American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., MCI Communications Corp. and U.S. Sprint Communications Co., a unit of United Telecommunications Inc., to provide bids for the entire network as well as separate operations within the network. &quot;We've asked them to bid on any piece where they believe they have an exceptional competitive advantage,&quot; said Robert Niebanck, director of telecommunications at Merrill Lynch. &quot;We want to determine whether or not any vendor or a combination of vendors can provide us the same quality of service we now enjoy more cost effectively.&quot;    If any jobs are found to be more efficiently provided by a bidder, then the people whose jobs are affected will be redeployed, Mr. Niebanck said. &quot;My problem is retaining these high level technical people in a highly competitive marketplace,&quot; he said.    Merrill executives familiar with the telecommunications operations offer a different view. They said the company currently uses a combination of dedicated private lines and public lines to transmit voice, data and video signals. The use of the lines is coordinated by an internal technical staff and managers. By hiring a company like ATandamp;T or MCI to manage its telecommunications network, the internal managers and technical staff will almost certainly lose their jobs, the executives claim.    &quot;Why should an MCI or ATandamp;T use our managers when they're being hired to use their own?&quot; said one senior executive, who asked not to be named.    Separately, Merrill chairman and chief executive officer William A. Schreyer said that fourth-quarter earnings estimates will be &quot;pretty much according to analysts' projections&quot; of 45 cents to 65 cents a share in spite of a sharp drop in stock trading volume. Gains from the company's fixed securities trading and its investment banking operations &quot;more than made up for the lack of equity business&quot; in the quarter, he said.    The estimates don't take into account the positive effect of a previously announced $220 million one-time gain in the fourth quarter from a pension-plan change.    In the year-earlier fourth quarter, Merrill, the nation's biggest brokerage house, earned $3.5 million, or two cents a share, on revenue of $2.71 billion.    Unlike a number of Wall Street firms that have recently tried to encourage retail trading by boosting brokerage commissions, Merrill has no plans to increase commissions, Mr. Schreyer said. </TEXT></DOC>
