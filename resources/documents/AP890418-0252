Alfredo Stroessner ran thecountry. It's something more than that now as the nation heads intoelections May 1, but some people are still wary.   ``A lot of people believe we are already living a democracy, butwe say it is only a transition which began suddenly and could endjust as suddenly,'' says Euclides Acevedo, president of theopposition Revolutionary Febrerista Party. ``We hope it willculminate in democracy.''   Andres Rodriguez, who toppled Stroessner on Feb. 3 and becamethe provisional president, has lifted restrictions on politicalparties, restored civil liberties, accused former governmentofficials of corruption and torture, allowed exiles to return.   But Rodriguez, like Stroessner, is a general who used hisposition to amass riches and act with impunity.   And he is the presidential candidate of the ruling ColoradoParty, which is almost certain to win the presidency and control ofCongress in the balloting.   Domingo Laino, Rodriguez's main rival for president, notes thatchanges so far have come from the top, not the bottom, wherefarmers are clamoring for land, workers for the enforcement oflabor laws, politicians for constitutional reform, women for equalrights.   ``What's going to happen when people demand more than thegovernment wants to give? There could be a crisis,'' Laino said inan interview at his sprawling home where until recently he oftenwas held under house arrest.   However, he added, ``I'm optimistic and I think the country is,too. People feel we are moving forward.''   After an initial outburst of public joy, Paraguayans settleddown quickly after Rodriguez's coup.   Victor Baez Mosqueiro, head of the InterUnion Movement ofWorkers, began pressing for labor reforms such as the right tostrike and to join a union other than the pro-government ParaguayWorkers Confederation.   ``Now that we have freedom, we're going to demand a raise,''teacher Maria Rosa Marin said. ``Before, we were afraid they wouldfire us.''   In general, Paraguayans seem anxious for change, not vengeance,and are looking hopefully to the future from a past that sawstate-of-seige legislation renewed every 90 days for 32 years andpeople followed, beaten up, jailed and exiled.   ``The question is whether the Colorado Party can correct theerrors committed by the Colorado Party. I doubt it,'' says FernandoVera, an economist and the presidential candidate of theRevolutionary Febrerista Party.   Asked that question, Edgar Ynsfran, Stroessner's onetimeinterior minister and now an adviser to Rodriguez and thethird-ranking member of the party, responded, ``I'm not certainthat we do have that capacity, but the good will is there.''   A lot changed, or at least appeared to, the very morningRodriguez told Paraguayans by radio that the 76-year-old Stroessnerhad ``resigned'' after all-night fighting between troops firingtanks shells and heavy machine guns at each other.   Rodriguez, 65, formed a Cabinet that observers say is excellent.He publicly endorsed human rights and invited opposition leaderslike Laino to the national palace.   The stolid, stocky general now wears civilian clothes in public,travels with few bodyguards, talks with reporters without requiringquestions to be submitted in advance, seems sensitive to theopinions of others and plays tennis with U.S. Ambassador TimothyTowell.   Paraguayans are impressed not only by the return to publicationof the banned newspaper ABC Color, but also by Rodriguez's visit toa hospital that was a hotbed of opposition to Stroessner, and to aMass celebrated by a bishop who was reviled by the formergovernment.   ``Just by walking into the hospital ... Rodriguez was sayingthey (doctors and nurses) were right in their struggle,'' said JoseCarlos Rodriguez (no relation), a 41-year-old economist, politicalscientist and pollster.   Though photographs of Rodriguez have cropped up in touristhotels as well as government offices, he has not sought the cult ofpersonality that enveloped Stroessner, for whom a polka, a riversteamer, a neighborhood, an airport and a city were named.   ``Stroessner was a god in Paraguay,'' said Benjamin Arditti, a33-year-old sociologist. ``By toppling Stroessner, Rodriguez alsodemonstrated that no one is god, not even him; and that he realizesthat the country is not going back to where it was.''   Another change that Paraguayans noticed and like is thatRodriguez attends functions with his wife and daughters.Stroessner, in contrast, didn't live with his wife and had severalmistresses over the years. He now is in exile in Brazil.   ``Rodriguez supports family values,'' said Aldo Zuccolillo,editor of ABC Color.   ``Yes, the Colorado Party is going to win. ... If Satanoverthrew Stroessner, every Paraguayan would vote for the devil.''   But part of the explanation, however, is the dominance of theColorado Party, which claims 1.4 million supporters, requiresmembership as a condition of public employment, and finances itselfby payroll deductions.   The party also will benefit by an out-of-date voter list thateven Colorados admit is bloated, and by practices like therequirement that each party, no matter how small, distribute itsown ballots to thousands of polling desks across a rural, in manyareas roadless, country the size of California.   Still, Rodriguez has a popularity that can't be denied.   ``I have confidence in Rodriguez, not just because he replacedStroessner,'' said Maria Celeste Solis, an 18-year-old studentstanding in line to register to vote for the first time. ``Theothers seem disorganized to me. He's more mature, competent.''   Businessmen were won over, and Paraguay's economy wasstabilized, when Rodriguez unified the currency exchange rate.   Opposition politicians decided to participate in the electionswhen Rodriguez promised not to run again in 1993, endorsedconstitutional reform, reopened voter registration, gave candidatesaccess to the national radio network, and required that voters'fingers be dipped in indelible ink to prevent multiple voting.   Rodriguez also thought to provide homes for the families ofsoldiers _ on both sides _ who died in the fighting during the coup.   ``He really is a man of the people,'' said the Rev. MarioMelanio Medina, a Catholic priest and frequent critic ofStroessner. ``When he gives his word, he will try and keep it.''   The diplomatic view, however, is wait and see.   ``The question is,'' said one foreign diplomat, ``is all this apolitical exercise, or is it a reflection of something new andbetter? Our general view is, once you unstop the bottle, you can'tput the cork back.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Mon AMs April 24</NOTE></DOC>
