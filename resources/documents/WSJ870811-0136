Brokerage houses, among them some of the most prestigious names on Wall Street, are employing the rudest, crudest and most obnoxious telephone marketers I have encountered in a sales, marketing and management career that spans 36 years.

In turning away unsolicited sales pitches, they try to be polite but the discourtesies they encounter are amazing. Are marketing managers really aware of how they are creating enemies? It seems to me this should concern not only investors, but also those whose livelihoods depend on commissions on trades made by people like me.    Nathaniel A.
