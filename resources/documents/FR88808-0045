The rule will affect the economy byless than 100 million a year. The action will not significantly raise costsor prices for consumers, industries, government agencies or geographicregions. There will not be a significant adverse effect on competition,employment, investment, productivity, innovation or on the ability of UnitedStates enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprise in domesticor export markets. Therefore, the Department has classified this actionas ``not major''.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12372</ITAG>The Food Stamp Program is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistanceunder No. 10.651. For the reasons set forth in the final rule and relatednotice to 7 CFR 3015, Subpart V (48 FR 29115), this Program is excludedfrom the scope of Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmentalconsultation with State and local officials.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>This action has also been reviewed in relation to the requirements of theRegulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, September19, 1980). Anna Kondratas, Administrator of the Food and Nutrition Service(FNS), has certified that this action will not have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities. The changes will affectState and local agencies which administer the Food Stamp Program. Thisaction is principally directed toward the development of Statewide ADPsystems. It is anticipated that Federal funding would be requested foronly a small number of county or local government systems under the provisionsof this proposed rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507),the information collection requirements that are included in this proposedrule will be submitted for approval to the Office of Management and Budget(OMB). Such provisions shall not be effective until OMB approval has beenobtained. Other organizations and individuals desiring to submit commentson the information collection requirements should address them to Mr. O'Connorat the above address, and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs,OMB, New Executive Office Building (Room 3028), Washington, DC 20503, ATTN:Desk Officer for FNS-USDA.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>The Department published a rule on December 30, 1980, at 45 FR 85699, whichset forth the requirements for payment of certain administrative costsof State agencies which operate the Food Stamp Program. These requirementsare codified at 7 CFR Part 277 and Appendix A of that Part, and derivedfrom four Federal Management Circulars (FMC's): FMC 74-4, issued originallyby the General Services Administration, but now under the Office of Managementand Budget (OMB); OMB Circular A-90, ``Cooperating with State and LocalGovernments to Coordinate and Improve Information Systems''; OMB CircularA-102, ``Uniform Requirements for Grants to State and Local Governments'';and OMB Circular A-87, ``Cost Principles for State and Local Governments.''The procedures and funding conditions for State agencies to request Federalfunds for the acquisition of ADP equipment and services to support theadministration of the Food Stamp Program are set forth in Section B. (<T3>Costs allowable with approval of FNS</T3>) of Appendix A, to 7 CFRPart 277.On June 11, 1982, the Department published a rule at 47 FR 25496 to implementSection 129 of Pub. L. 96-249, which allowed enhanced Federal financialparticipation (FFP) at the 75 percent level for costs associated with theplanning, design, development, acquisition, or installation of ADP systems.In section 277.18, the Department codified the requirements and proceduresfor State agencies to receive 75 percent funding for certain ADP developmentalprojects. The existing requirements of andSection; 277.18, in conjunctionwith those of Appendix A to part 277, currently apply to ADP developmentalprojects to be funded at the 75 percent funding rate. The conditions ofAppendix A alone currently apply to ADP projects to be funded at the regular50 percent rate.In August 1985, an Interdepartmental Task Force was established consistingof representatives from FNS, the Health Care Financing Administration,the Family Support Administration, and the Office of Human DevelopmentalServices. The Interdepartmental Task force conducted a comprehensive reviewof the current Federal policies and procedures involved in the review,approval and funding of State agency ADP developmental projects in orderto streamline, improve and standardize the overall process and requirementsamong the affected Federal agencies. Specifically, the Task Force examinationand revision of the current HHS and FNS regulatory requirements and procedureswere intended to meet the following principal objectives:1. Streamline the Advance Planning Document (APD) review and approval processto eliminate redundant Federal and State reviews;2. Enhance State planning for developmental projects;3. Improve project development continuity;4. Allow for a more comprehensive Federal review and more timely responseto APD's;5. Standardize procedures and requirements among participating Federalagencies; and6. Enhance the cooperative partnership between State and Federal agenciesto achieve ADP and management information system applications that advancethe efficiency and effectiveness of State administration of Federal programs.The principal changes recommended by the Task Force involve the proceduresand conditions under which States may request and receive funding for ADPdevelopmental projects through the submission, review and approval of APD'sand other related documents. The procedures proposed herein comprise therevised APD process and are being proposed by both FNS and HHS to ensurestandardization, whenever possible, among Federal agencies.<ITAG tagnum="84">Significant Proposed Changes in APD Process</ITAG>1. <T3>Increased APD Prior Approval Cost Thresholds_Section 277.18(c)</T3>Current rules in Section B of Appendix A require written prior approvalfrom FNS for the acquisition of ADP equipment or services with a combinedFederal and State cost of $100,000 or more over a 12-month period, or acost of $200,000 or more (Federal <T3>or</T3> State) for the total acquisition. Revised andSection; 277.18(c)would increase the Federal prior approval cost thresholds for ADP developmentprojects to be funded at the 50 percent matching rate from $100,000 to$200,000 in total Federal and State costs over any 12-month period, andfrom $200,000 to $300,000 for total acquisition costs. State agencies wouldbe required to obtain the prior written approval of FNS for ADP acquisitionsexceeding the revised standards. The revised cost thresholds are intendedto permit State agencies to implement smaller systems or system changesmore quickly, reduce the number of small acquisitions requiring Federalprior approval, and reduce paperwork burden. These changes would also makeFood Stamp Program prior approval cost thresholds and procedures consistentwith those of HHS agencies, which were revised in a final rule at 51 FR45321, published on December 18, 1986. This proposed rule also clarifiesthat <T3>all</T3> ADP developmental projects for which 75 percent Federal fundingis requested are subject to FNS prior approval requirements, regardlessof cost.2. <T3>Establishment of Two-Phase APD Process_Section 277.18(d)</T3>State agencies would request prior approval for ADP services and equipmentacquisitions, as outlined above, through the submission of an Advance PlanningDocument (APD). The proposed APD process would consist of two distinctphases_the Project Planning Phase and the Implementation Phase. The ProjectPlanning Phase would represent all activities necessary for the State agencyto determine whether the acquisition and application of ADP services orequipment are necessary and feasible, and to develop plans to design andprepare for the ADP acquisition. The Project Implementation Phase consistsof all activities involved in the acquisition, installation and implementationof ADP systems, services and/or equipment. To request and obtain FFP forallowable costs of the Project Planning and Implementation Phases, Stateagencies would be required to submit a Planning APD and an ImplementationAPD for the prior approval of FNS.<ITAG tagnum="54">States agencies would be entitled to receive the 75 percent fundingrate for approved costs of both the Project Planning and ImplementationPhases, provided that the proposed ADP system or application was determinedby FNS to meet all applicable conditions for 75 percent funding.</ITAG>The Department is proposing the two-phase APD process to address a majorconcern with the current process for requesting and approving funds forADP developmental projects. The current process does not provide a meansto request and receive commitment for up-front Federal funding for thepurpose of planning major ADP system acquisitions, before initiating systemdevelopment. Without a firm up-front commitment of Federal funding, thelevel of planning for system development has frequently been inadequate.The current process requires submission and prior approval of an APD fortotal system development prior to the acquisition of any ADP services orequipment for projects exceeding the prior approval cost thresholds. Inthe past, State agencies have submitted APD funding proposals for totalsystem development without sufficiently planning the entire acquisition,in order to comply with current approval requirements and initiate Federalfunding as soon as possible. As a result, many APD proposals and fundingrequests have been submitted which are inadequate and premature, causingsubstantial subsequent revisions, time and cost overruns, and, in somecases, project termination due to lack of sufficient prior planning.The proposed process establishes a separate Project Planning Phase, inwhich State agencies could request Federal funding only for project planningactivities. The Department believes that this approach would contributeto more effective, efficient and economical acquisitions of ADP equipmentand services by providing for more comprehensive planning by State agenciesprior to full system development. State agency requests to receive FFPfor Project Planning Phase activities would be made through the submissionof a Planning APD. The costs for project planning activities which areeligible for FFP include, but are not limited to the costs associated with:requirements and systems analyses, feasibility studies and alternativesanalyses, general system design, and preparation of an Implementation APD.A State agency's Planning APD may request funding to complete all necessaryplanning activities, or may request funding to a preliminary step (e.g.,feasibility study) with additional funding subsequently requested basedon the results of the completed activities. The Planning APD is subjectto the prior approval of FNS. Appropriate written prior approval is requiredbefore the State agency may proceed with any contractual or other commitmentsfor ADP planning services.The Planning APD would describe the State agency's needs, objectives, intendedplanning activities and proposed budget, and would also represent commitmentby the State agency to perform necessary planning activities as a conditionfor FFP for those planning activities. Planning APD funding requests andapprovals would be limited to planning activities only, including contractualsupport; no significant hardware or software development costs would beeligible for funding in the Project Planning Phase.Upon successful completion of project planning activities, the State agencyshould be fully prepared to request funding for and proceed with ImplementationPhase activities for the acquisition, development, installation and implementationof the proposed ADP system. State agency requests to receive FFP for ImplementationPhase activities would be made through submission of an ImplementationAPD. The Implementation APD represents a written plan of action to acquire,develop and install the proposed ADP equipment or services.Following review of the Planning or Implementation APD, FNS will providewritten notification to the State agency of approval or the reasons fordisapproval. The approval letters will specify the amount of FNS FFP authorizedfor each separate phase in project development.A State agency would not receive FFP for planning costs unless a PlanningAPD is submitted and approved. However, State agencies could submit anImplementation APD directly, without prior submission or approval of thePlanning APD, if the State agency does not wish to receive FFP for projectplanning activities.3. <T3>Reduction in Prior Approval Requirements_Section 277.18(c)</T3>To simplify the APD process, reduce paperwork burden and enhance projectdevelopment continuity, the Department proposes to reduce the number ofdocuments currently required for the prior approval of FNS. FNS prior approvalis currently required for the following documents related to ADP equipmentor services acquisitions: Advance Planning Documents; Requests for Proposal(RFP's); contracts; and service agreements. In addition to representinga significant paperwork burden, State agencies have commented that thenumerous prior approval decision points have caused disruption and temporarydiscontinuation of project development schedules and activities, resultingin increased project costs. The Department proposes to alleviate theseproblems by limiting prior approval requirements to those necessary tomaintain appropriate control and management of developmental project activitiesand funding.The Department proposes that FNS written prior approval be limited to:<ITAG tagnum="15">_Both the Planning APD and the Implementation APD for all projectsto be funded at the 75 percent funding rate, regardless of total projectcost, and projects to be funded at the regular FFP rate which exceed theprior approval cost thresholds proposed in andSection; 277.18(c);</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_RFP's, when specifically required by FNS; and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Contracts or contract amendments, when specifically required by FNS.</ITAG>As indicated above, FNS may require prior approval for RFP's, contractsand/or contract amendments for certain ADP acquisitions due to the complexityof the procurement, the amount of funds involved, or previous State problemswith procurement actions. However, RFP's or contracts which are less than$100,000 for regular FFP or $50,000 for enhanced FFP, and are an integralpart of the approved APD need not be submitted to FNS; contract amendmentsunder $50,000 for either funding level need not be submitted. FNS wouldformally notify the State agency of such prior approval requirements atthe time of approval of the APD or subsequent Annually Updated APD's, asdiscussed below and in andSection; 277.18(e). Unless FNS specifically requiresprior approval for certain RFP's or contracts, the only documents requiringprior FNS approval would be the Planning and Implementation APD's.The Department believes that two other documents may be a such importancein the development of certain ADP projects as to warrant the approval (althoughnot the <T3>prior </T3>approval) of FNS. Approval and prior approval differ inthat written ``prior approval'' must be obtained before the State agencymay enter into any contractual agreements or make any other commitmentsfor acquiring the ADP equipment or services to be funded with FFP; ``approval''means that FNS written approval of specific APD process documents mustbe obtained before the State agency may claim FFP for certain costs, butState agencies may enter contractual agreements and/or make commitmentsfor the ADP acquisition without first obtaining Federal approval. Section 277.18(c)(3)(i)(A) would provide for the submission of the feasibilitystudy to FNS for approval within 90 days of completion for certain ADPprojects. This approval requirement would be applicable only if specifiedby FNS as a condition for approving the Planning APD, when a systems developmentproject is particularly large or complex, or when a State agency has experiencedprevious problems in this area. Section 277.18(d)(2)(ii) would requirethat the feasibility study and alternatives analyses supporting the selectedsystem design generally be submitted as part of the Implementation APDfor FNS approval. Thus, all feasibility studies and associated alternativesanalyses would be submitted to FNS and would be subject to approval, eitherwithin 90 days after completion or upon submission of the ImplementationAPD.Section 277.18 (c)(3)(i)(B) would also require the approval of AnnuallyUpdated APD's, as discussed later in this preamble. State agency serviceagreements would not be submitted to FNS for review or informational purposes.All service agreements would be maintained on file at the State agencyand be made available to FNS upon request.4. Annually Updated APD_Section 277.18(f)The Department is proposing a new paragraph (e) to andSection; 277.18 whichwould require the submission and approval of an annual report, the AnnuallyUpdated APD, on the status of approved ADP developmental projects. Theannually Updated APD would represent a self-certification by the Stateagency of the status of project activities and expenditures in relationto the provisions of the approved Planning or Implementation APD over thepast year. The report would be submitted annually as a condition for continuedFFP for the ADP development project and would consist of three components:1. A report on the status of major project activities, milestones and deliverablesfor the past year;2. A detailed accounting of all expenditures for the ADP developmentalproject for the past year as compared to the budget of the Planning orImplementation APD as approved; and3. Changes to the approved provisions of the Planning and ImplementationAPD. Such changes may be submitted as they occur during the year or atone time as a component of the Annually Updated APD. The Annually UpdatedAPD would be used by FNS to monitor project development and expenditureswithin the context of the approved provisions of the APD.However, for projects funded at the regular FFP rate, the Annually UpdatedAPD need not be submitted unless any of the following changes occur:(a) A change of $50,000 in total approved project costs over the courseof the project;(b) An extension of 60 days or more in timeframes for projected milestones;(c) A change in procurement activities; or (d) A significant change in system concept.Changes in approved procurement activities include: <ITAG tagnum="15">_A change in procurement methodology that would limit competitionbeyond what was decribed in the APD (e.g., a change from competitive tononcompetitive procurement);</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_A reduction or increase in the procurement activities which weredescribed in the APD; or</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_A change from an acquisition which supports the needs of more thanthe State agency (e.g., a ``blanket'' contract) to an acquisition whichwould benefit solely the State agency.</ITAG>Significant changes in approved system concept include:<ITAG tagnum="15">_A proposal of a different system alternative;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_A proposal for a different ``mix'' of system hardware and software;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_A change in project plan;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_A change in the cost/benefits projection; or</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_A change to the approved cost allocation methodology.</ITAG>Federal approval, no later than at the time fo the next Annually UpdatedADP, is required for project changes before FFP for the change may be claimed.However, State agencies may proceed with the change without first obtainingFederal approval, to avoid disruption in project activities. In such instances,the State agency would be liable for costs associated with the projectchange until FNS approval is granted. If the Annually Updated ADP is subsequentlydisapproved, FFP would not be allowed for the costs associated with theproject change.5. Emergency ADP Acquisitions_Section 277.18(h)The Department is proposing procedures for the acquisition of ADP equipmentor services for emergency situations in a new paragraph (h) to andSection;277.18. The Department recognizes that situations may arise which precludea State agency from following the prior approval requirements of andSection;277.18(c) before acting to correct an emergency situation in order to meetprogram requirements. The proposed procedures for State agencies to requestapproval of FFP for emergency situations, FNS' response to such requests,and subsequent submission of ADP documentation parallel the emergency acquisitionprocedures currently in place for HHS agencies at 45 CFR 95.624. The Departmentwould consider ``emergency situations'' to be those which could not bereasonably anticipated by the State agency. Examples of such situationsinclude equipment failure due to physical damage or destruction causedby natural or other disasters, or changes imposed by Federal legislativerequirements which necessitate immediate acquisition of ADP equipment orservices. The Department would not consider emergency situations to becircumstances arising from poor planning on the part of the State agency.In determining whether a situation should be considered as an emergency,the State agency would be required to demonstrate that its need to immediatelyacquire ADP equipment or services was unexpected and could not have beenanticipated or planned.System Transfer_Section 277.18(d)On September 18, 1987, the Department published a final rule, titled ``FoodStamp Program: Automation of Data Processing (ADP) Model Plan'' (52 FR35221). That rule set forth a requirement for State agencies to submitto the Department their plans for automation in the Food Stamp Program.That rule also addressed the issue of system transfer, and the considerationa State agency must give to modifying an existing system when determininghow to best fulfill an identified automation need.In the analysis of comments received on the model plan rule, it was determinedthat the actual assessment of potentially transferable systems was moreappropriately a part of the Advance Planning Document process, rather thanpart of the model plan requirements. Therefore language is proposed inthe ADP approval requirements at andSection; 277.18(d)(2)(ii) to requirethat State agencies consider the transfer or modification of an existingsystem in the Implementation ADP, as part of the feasibility study andassociated alternatives analyses. The model plan rule, however, continuesto require at 7 CFR 272.10(a)(2) and (3) that State agencies show in theirplans that system transfer will be considered in the planning process.In this rule, the Department proposes that State agencies must includean examination of the transfer or modification of an existing system froma similar State or jurisdiction as a component of all feasibility studies.State agencies planning automation using any method other than transfer,or State agencies planning to develop new systems must include a specificanalysis of their consultations with other State agencies. The analysismust show that the State agencies they consulted were similar to them interms of whether the States were urban or rural; whether or not the States'programs were county-administered; the geographic size of the States; andthe size of the caseload in each State. In addition, State agencies rejectingtransfer must provide a specific analysis describing barriers to transfer.Each barrier must be accompanied by an analysis comparing the costs ofovercoming the problem to the cost of developing a new system.Common reasons cited in opposition to transfer include: the State agencyis required to use a central data processing facility and the (otherwise)transferable system is incompatible with it; the State agency's data basemanagement software is incompatible with the transferable system; the Stateagency's ADP experts are not familiar with the software/hardware used bythe transferable system and acquiring new expertise would be expensive;the transferable system is interactive or uses ``generic'' caseworkers,while the receiving State agency does not, and it would be expensive tomodify the existing system and/or procedures; and transfer would provokedisputes with the State agency's personnel union. Demonstration of anyof these or similar problems alone is insufficient justification for rejectingtransfer or adaptation. While these reasons for rejecting transfer arenot unacceptable, State agencies which cite any of these reasons shouldnot expect <T3>automatic </T3>approval. Rather, the State agency will be expectedto show, as part of the ADP, why the barrier to transfer cannot be overcome.The Department also recognizes that FNS has an important role to play inregard to the analysis of potential system transfers. The model plan rulecited previously includes a provision at 7 CFR 272.10(a)(3)(iii) whichstates that FNS will assist State agencies that request assistance in determiningwhat other States have systems that should be considered as possible transfers.The Department believes that some State agencies may request such assistanceas one of the Project Planning Phase activities.Disallowance of Federal Financial Participation_Section 277.18(o).A new paragraph (o), Disallowance of Federal Financial Participation (FFP),would be added to andSection; 277.18 which provides that, if the Departmentfinds that any equipment or services acquisition approved or modified underthe provisions of andSection; 277.18(c) fails to substantially comply withthe criteria, requirements, and other undertakings prescribed in the approvedADP, payment of FFP may be disallowed. The Department approves FFP on thebasis that the equipment or services acquisitions proposed under ADP'swill add to the proper and efficient operation of the Food Stamp Program.By the same token, if the Department finds that a State agency fails tosubstantially comply with the terms of an approved ADP, to the detrimentof the proper and efficient operation of the program, the Department maydisallow FFP. The reasons for which the Department may disallow FFP include,but may not be limited to, failure of the proposed system to meet programeffectiveness and efficiency objectives contained in the approved ADP,and schedule slippages which result in cost overruns which eliminate expectedfuture cost savings or otherwise adversely affect cost-benefit projections.ADP System Security Provisions_Section 277.18(p)The Department is proposing a new paragraph (p) to andSection; 277.18 titled``ADP System Security Requirements and Review Process'' to establish minimumstandard requirements for the security of non-Federal ADP systems usedby State and local governments in the administration of the Food StampProgram. The Department believes that increased reliance on automated systemsto administer the Program, and greater sophistication and complexity ofthe systems have resulted in the need to establish standard regulatoryrequirements to ensure the security of ADP facilities, equipment and operationsand the privacy of information. The need for standard regulatory requirementswas demonstrated by a recent audit of the security of non-Federal ADP systemsconducted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Office of the InspectorGeneral (USDA/IG).The USDA/IG reviewed the security of thirteen non-Federal ADP systems usedby State and loca governments to support the administration of the FNSFood Stamp Program and Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infantsand Children. The USDA/IG Audit Report 50651-2-CH, issued in October 1985,disclosed a wide range of computer security weaknesses and related problems.Some of the more serious problems concerned inadequate controls over physicalsecurity which could allow unrestricted access to computer hardware, andinadequate software controls which could permit improper manipulation ofdata or payments. The USDA/IG found weaknesses in the organizational controlsof data processing in all of the thirteen State agencies audited. Further,the USDA/IG found that none of the thirteen State agencies audited hadestablished formal procedures or requirements to ensure that such ADP systemsmet minimum ADP security standards. A copy of this report can be obtainedby contacting the USDA/IG for Audit, Room 247-E, Administration Building,Washington, DC, NW., 20250.The proposed new paragraph on ADP system security requires State agenciesto establish a security program for ADP systems and operations used inthe administration of the Food Stamp Program. The security program wouldconsist of three principal components: appropriate State agency ADP securitystandards and requirements to ensure proper control of ADP equipment, facilitiesand information; State agency procedures and processes for meeting theestablished security standards and requirements; and security reviews forensuring that established standards and requirements are met. Specifically,the proposed ADP security provisions establish the following principalrequirements.1. State agencies are responsible for the development of appropriate standardsand requirements to properly safeguard ADP resources and information processing.This requirement is intended to establish a baseline in each State agencyfor safeguarding ADP resources and information processing against whichthe effectiveness of the State agency's security program may be measured.The Department considers the establishment of such baseline requirementsto be critical to the effective safeguarding of ADP resources and informationprocessing and to subsequent evaluation of the effectiveness of a Stateagency's security program.The Department believes that it is more appropriate to allow State agenciesto determine the specific minimum standards and requirements to governthe security of their own ADP systems based on the unique circumstancesof each State, rather than mandate general standards to apply for all Stateand local agencies. The rule proposes that, in developing appropriate ADPsecurity standards and requirements, State agencies use standards currentlygoverning the security of Federal ADP systems or recognized industry standardsas the basis for the development of State-specific standards and requirements.2. State agencies would be required by andSection; 277.18(p) to establishan ADP security program to implement plans, policies and procedures tomeet the State agency's ADP security standards and requirements and tomaintain an ongoing program for conducting periodic risk analyses to evaluatepotential threats to the system and incorporate appropriate safeguards.The ongoing ADP security program represents the State agency's policiesand operational procedures, and the organizational responsibilities whichwould be undertaken to meet the standards and requirements to properlysafeguard ADP resources and information processing. The Department believesthat such procedures are critical to meeting the ADP security standardsand requirements established by a State agency. The rule proposes eightspecific areas of ADP security which must, at a minimum, be included inthe State agency's ADP security requirements and program:<ITAG tagnum="15">_Physical security of ADP resources;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Equipment security to protect equipment from theft and unauthorizeduse;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Software and data security;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Telecommunications security;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Personnel security;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Contingency plans to meet critical processing needs in the eventof short- or long-term interruption of service;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Emergency preparedness; and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Designation of an Agency ADP Security Manager.</ITAG>These eight areas comprise what the Department has determined to be theprincipal critical components of a security program for automated dataprocessing activities. The Department has made this determination basedon experience gained from dealing with the security of internal Departmentautomated data processing activities, dealings with other Federal agenciesin this area, and dealings with private industry on matters pertainingto automated data processing security.3. State agencies would be required to establish an ongoing program ofreviews of the security of ADP installations to ensure adequacy of safeguardsand controls. The Department is proposing the performance of such reviewson a biennial basis and the submission of ADP system review reports toFNS upon completion. The proposed rule specifies that the proposed ADP security provisions wouldapply to all developmental ADP projects and currently operating ADP systems.The Department does not intend that the State agency's ADP security standards,requirements or plans would be submitted to FNS for review or approval.It would be the responsibility of the State agency to ensure proper securityof the ADP system and information processing. The completed State agencyADP security reviews would be required to be submitted to FNS, in orderto identify and monitor any necessary corrective action. <ITAG tagnum="84">Other Proposed Revisions </ITAG>Several changes and additions to the existing regulatory language are beingproposed to increase consistency with HHS in the terminology and policiesdefined in this section. 1. The ``Definitions'' currently contained in Part 277 Appendix A wouldbe moved to andSection;27.18(b) and revised as follows: ``Advance Planning Document (APD) for Project Planning'', ``APD for ProjectImplementation'' and ``Annually Updated APD'' would be added to the listof definitions, to correspond to the revised APD approval procedures whichare being proposed concurrently by HHS and FNS. ``Enhanced funding'' or ``enhanced FFP rate'' would be added to specifythe 75 percent funding level for the planning, design, development andinstallation of computerized systems as authorized by andSection;227.4(b)(1)(ii).A corresponding definition for ``regular funding'' or ``regular FFP rate''would also be added. These definitions are intended to clarify the specificrequirements which pertain only to projects funded at the 75 percent level,as opposed to those which apply to any other authorized funding level.``Emergency situation'' would be defined, to correspond to current HHSprovisions at 45 CFR 95.605, as discussed previously. ``System design'' would be removed from the current list of definitionsin Part 277 Appendix A, and would be replaced with the definition of ``GeneralSystems Design''. ``Requirements analysis'' would be defined, to correspond to current HHSprovisions at 45 CFR 95.605. 2. Regulatory language is proposed for andSection;277.18(f) regarding requirementsfor service agreements when data processing services are to be providedby a State central data processing facility or another State or local agency.In addition to removing the requirement for submission of service agreementsto FNS, this paragraph would expand the definition of ``Service agreement''currently contained in Part 277 Appendix A, to correspond to current HHSprovisions at 45 CFR 95.605. 3. The Department's policy regarding the depreciation of capital expenditureswhen claiming the costs of ADP equipment having unit or total aggregateacquisition costs of more than $25,000, would be set forth in proposedandSection;277.18(i)(3). This provision would allow the State agency to requesta waiver from the requirement to depreciate such costs, thereby allowingthe costs to be ``expensed'' or claimed at the time of acquisition. TheDepartment wishes to clarify, however, that the approval of a waiver wouldnot affect the approved level of FFP for allowable costs. That is, forprojects approved at the 75 percent funding level, only the proportionateshare of the costs of capital assets assignable to the developmental phaseof the project may be claimed at the enhanced level. This requirement wouldnot preclude the approval of a waiver to expense the costs of such acquisitions,as long as the FFP levels for developmental and operational costs weredetermined in accordance with the provisions of these regulations. 4. In order to further clarify the delineation between the developmentaland operational phases, for purposes of approving and claiming costs atthe 75 percent funding level, this rule proposes a provision at andSection;277.18(g)(6)which would limit pilot tests and parallel processing for test purposesto a period not to exceed three months, unless specifically extended byFNS. The Department believes that three months represents an average andadequate period of time for pilot testing in most systems. However, theDepartment is interested in receiving comments as to whether or not thisprovision is consistent with previous State agency experiences. <ITAG tagnum="84">Structural Changes to Part 277 </ITAG>The Department is proposing several structural changes to Part 277 to providegreater clarity, avoid redundancy, and consolidate the requirements andprocedures for the FNS APD process in one section of Part 277. Currentrules governing the acquisition of ADP services and equipment at the 75percent funding rate are provided in 7 CFR 277.18. Rules for ADP acquisitionsat the regular 50 percent funding rate are contained in Part 277 AppendixA, Section B. The two sections defining the APD process are duplicativeand can be confusing, and the Department is proposing to consolidate allprocedures, conditions and requirements governing the acquisition of ADPservices and equipment in a new proposed andSection;277.18. The consolidationof the section and appendix would result in the following revisions. 1. Paragraph 277.18(b) would be deleted. This paragraph provided for theretroactive entitlement to the 75 percent funding rate for Advance PlanningDocuments approved before the June 11, 1982 publication date of the 75percent funding provisions. As funding for all such projects has alreadyoccurred or been resolved, this provision no longer applies.2. Paragraphs 277.18 (e)(1) and (e)(2) would be deleted. These paragraphsdescribe the prior approval and document submission processes for projectsfunded at the 75 percent rate. The provisions of these paragraphs wouldbe redundant, as the revised process would establish the same approvaland document submission procedures for ADP projects at either funding ratein new andSection; 277.18(c).3. Paragraph 277.18(h) would be deleted. This paragraph describes the requirementsfor system specifications approval, procurements, ownership rights, andthe title, use and disposition of property for ADP developmental projectsfunded at the enhanced rate. Similar requirements are restated in Part277 Appendix A, Section B. The proposed rule would eliminate duplicationby consolidating the requirements in new andSection; 277.18 only. The proposedrule in new andSection; 277.18(c) and (d) would require that system specificationsincluded as part of the general systems design be submitted for prior approvalin the Implementation APD for ADP developmental projects.Part 277 Appendix A, Sections B(5) and B(9) governing procurement requirementsand ownership rights, use, title and disposition of property would be redesignatedas andSection; 277.18(k) and (m), respectively.4. Part 277 Appendix A, Sections B(3) and B(6) which provided for generalFederal and State agency approval requirements for APD proposals wouldbe deleted. The proposed new andSection; 277.18(c) would provide for allsubmission and approval requirements for Advance Planning Documents andother associated documents.5. Part 277 Appendix A, Section B(12), which describes the conditions forapplying the provisions governing ADP acquisitions and funding containedin Part 277 Appendix A, would be deleted, as all of the procedures andconditions for requesting and approving funding for ADP acquisitions wouldbe deleted from Part 277 Appendix A and located in proposed new andSection;277.18. Proposed new andSection; 277.18(a) would describe the conditionsand scope of the provisions of the revised andSection; 277.18.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 277</ITAG>Food Stamps, government procedure, Grant programs-social programs, Investigations,Records, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.Accordingly, 7 CFR Part 277 is proposed to be amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 277_PAYMENTS OF CERTAIN ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS OF STATE AGENCIES</ITAG>1.

ADP equipment and services are consideredto be primarily acquired to support the Food Stamp Program when the Programmay reasonably be expected to either: be billed for more than 50 percentof the total charges made to all users of the ADP equipment and servicesduring the time period covered by the service agreement, or directly chargedfor the total cost of the purchase or lease of ADP equipment or services;(7) Include the beginning and ending dates of the period of time coveredby the service agreement; and(8) Include a schedule of expected total charges to the Program for thepeiod of the service agreement.(g) <T3>Entitlement to 75 percent FFP rate</T3>. (1) A State agency may, atits option, request reimbursement at a 75 percent FFP rate for the costsof planning, design, development or installation of ADP and informationretrieval systems. State agency requests for the 75 percent FFP rate shallbe made in accordance with this section, and appropriate instructions issuedby FNS.(2) The 75 percent funding level may be approved by FNS if the proposedsystem will:(i) Assist the State agency in meeting the requirements of the Food StampAct;(ii) Meet the program standards specified in andSection; 272.10(b) (1), (2)and (3), except for the requirements in andSection; 272.10(b)(2) (vi) and(vii) and (3)(ix) to eventually transmit data directly to FNS;(iii) Be likely to provide more efficient and effective administrationof the program; and(iv) Be compatible with other such systems utilized in the administrationof State plans under the program of Aid to Families with Dependent Children(AFDC).(3) State agencies seeking an enhanced level of funding for the planning,design, development or installation of automated data processing and informationretrieval systems shall develop statewide systems which are integratedwith AFDC. In cases where a State agency can demonstrate that a local,dedicated, or single function (issuance or certification only) system willprovide for more efficient and effective administration of the program,FNS may grant an exception to the statewide integrated requirement. Theseexceptions will be based on an assessment of the proposed system's abilityto meet the State agency's need for automation. Systems funded as exceptionsto this rule, however, should be capable, to the extent necessary, of anautomated data exchange with the State system used to administer AFDC.In no circumstances will funding be available for systems which duplicateother State agency systems, whether presently operational or planned forfuture development.(4) The system developed in response to these regulations shall containthe following elements, where appropriate:(i) A data base which receives information, sorts, performs calculations,and stores information;(ii) An information retrieval system which will have the ability to accessthe data base, display or print data, and update the data in numericalor alphabetical form;(iii) Hardware, in addition to that required for the data base, which willinclude visual display terminal(s) with an attached keyboard, connectedto the data base hardware components by telecommunications networks;(iv) Software which will include system programs for data recall and input,budget calculation capability when not included in the data base system,printout and display for data entry and inquiry terminals, and for networkcontrol; and(v) Technological safeguards and managerial procedures which will be establishedand applied to computer hardware, software, and data, in accordance withparagraph (p) of this section, in order to ensure the protection of theintegrity of the system and individual privacy. System security shall beinherent in the system and provided for in the Implementation APD submittedfor approval. The system will process machine readable data files usedfor the authorized exchange of information between levels of government(i.e., State to State, State to Federal).(5) Approval of the Planning APD and Implementation APD for payment byFNS of costs at the 75 percent level will be limited to:(i) Planning and design, i.e. requirements and systems analyses, feasibilitystudies, preliminary cost benefits analyses, alternatives analyses, andgeneral systems design;  (ii) Development, i.e. detailing of system and program specifications,programming and testing;  (iii) Procurement of ADP equipment and/or services; and  (iv) Installation, i.e. conversion, training of staff, and turnover tooperational status.  (6) Costs may not be funded at 75 percent when the approved system producesautomated processing of food stamp recipient applications, issuance authorizationsor other reports (operations) on a continuing basis for use by State agencypersonnel for administration of the Food Stamp Program. Operations includethe use of purchased or rented computer equipment and software directlyrequired for and used in the operation of the automated data processingand information retrieval system. For ADP development projects with phasedinstallation and implementation, counties, districts or other subdivisionsof the State shall be considered operational at the time that the approvedsystem produces automated application processing and/or issuance authorizationsfor the food stamp caseload for that subdivision of the State. Pilot testingand an initial period of parallel processing for test purposes may be considereddevelopmental costs and eligible for 75 percent funding for a period notto exceed 3 months, unless specifically extended by FNS.  (7) If FNS suspends approval of an APD in the course of a State agency'splanning, designing, development, or installation, the 75 percent levelof funding shall not be allowable for any costs incurred until such timeas the conditions for approval are met.  (8) Cost elements. Incident to the activities listed in paragraph (g)(5)of this section, a State agency may seek payment for the following expensesat a 75 percent level.  <T3>(i) </T3><T3>Personnel. </T3>Salaries, wages, travel, and benefits of personnelactually engaged in design, development, or installation of approved ADPsystems.  <T3>(ii) </T3><T3>Materials, equipment, facilities, and supplies. </T3>Costs of materials,equipment, facilities and supplies used in design, development, or installationof approved ADP systems. Only the proportionate share of the costs of capitalassets assignable to the period of time or prorated for usage may be claimedduring the design, development, or installation of these systems. Thisshare must be determined based on acquisition costs and/or depreciationor approved usage rates. Data with respect to such costs shall be submittedwith the request for funding.  <T3>(iii) </T3><T3>Contracted services. </T3>Services obtained under the provisions ofcontracts which meet the procurement standards of this part for the design,development, or installation of FNS approved systems.  <T3>(iv) </T3><T3>Management studies and preparation of other planning documents. </T3>Thecost of resources used to produce the Planning APD may be funded at the75 percent level regardless of final approval or denial of the PlanningAPD.  (h) <T3>Emergency acquisition requirements. </T3>The State agency may requestFFP for the costs of ADP equipment and services acquired to meet emergencysituations which preclude the State agency from following the prior approvalrequirements of andSection;277.18(c). In order for FNS to consider providingFFP in emergency situations, the following conditions must be met:  (1) The State agency must submit a written request to FNS prior to theacquisition of any ADP equipment or services. The written request mustbe sent by registered mail and shall include:  (i) A brief description of the ADP equipment and/or services to be acquiredand an estimate of their costs;  (ii) A brief description of the circumstances which result in the Stateagency's need to proceed with the acquisition prior to obtaining formalFNS approval; and  (iii) A description of the adverse impact which would result if the Stateagency does not immediately acquire the ADP equipment and/or services. (2) Upon receipt of a written request for emergency acquisition FNS willprovide a written reponse to the State agency within 14 days. The FNS responsewill:  (i) Inform the State agency that the request has been disapproved and thereason for disapproval; or,  (ii) Inform the State agency that FNS recognizes that an emergency situationexists and the State agency must submit a formal request for approval byFNS which includes the information specified at andSection;277.18(d)(2) within90 days from the date of the State agency's initial written request.  (iii) If FNS approves the request submitted under paragraph (h)(1) of thissection, FFP will be available from the date the State agency acquiresthe ADP equipment and services.  (i) <T3>Cost Determination and Claiming Costs_</T3>(1) <T3>Cost determination. </T3>Actual costs must be determined in compliancewith an FNS appoved budget and Appendix A to this part, and must be reconcilablewith the FNS funding level. There shall be no payments pursuant to thissection to the extent that a State agency is reimbursed for such costspursuant to any other Federal program or uses ADP systems for purposesnot connected with the Food Stamp Program. The State agency approved costallocation plan must be amended to disclose the methods which will be usedto identify and classify costs to be claimed at the 75 percent rate. Thismethodology must be submitted to FNS as part of the request for FNS approvalof funding at the 75 percent rate as required in paragraph (d)(3) of thissection. Any costs funded pursuant to these regulations shall be excludedin determining the State agency's administrative costs under any othersection of this part.
