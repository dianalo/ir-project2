In drilling, projects have includedreal-time field data acquisition for enhanced operations monitoring,databases for management of drilling information, drilling accountingsystems for better cost control, drilling simulation for performanceoptimization, advanced numerical techniques for specific problems, officeautomation for personnel efficiency, and expert systems for solving rulebased problems. This paper reviews general background and current technologyfor drilling computing and details ARCO's current drilling computingenvironment and its visions for the future in the area.</TEXT></DOC>
