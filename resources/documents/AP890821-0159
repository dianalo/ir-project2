The theme song from ``Chariots of Fire'' blared from loudspeakerswhen the new Democratic Party was launched in April, welding threeseparate and sometimes squabbling factions into one.   Now, in the homestretch of the campaign, the Democrats haveunveiled South Africa's first cinematic political advertisements,which appear amid film previews and cigarette commercials at movietheaters nationwide.   The films softpeddle the party's opposition to apartheid and itscall for black voting rights. Instead the ads accuse the NationalParty government of economic mismanagement and corruption.   The Democrats' roadside posters proclaim, ``We are the future.''Ads in newspapers try to dispel the liberals' ``soft on security''image by showing their candidates who were army or police officers.   Whether the imagery will convert to votes remains to be seen, butthere is no question the Democrats have presented the National Partywith its most serious election threat from the left since it tookpower in 1948.   The Democrats hold 19 of the 166 elected seats in Parliament'sdominant white chamber. Party leaders hope to double this number,and 30 seats seem possible to independent analysts.   What the Democrats hope for is a hung Parliament, with theNational Party losing its outright majority in a two-pronged squeezefrom the left and from the far-right Conservative Party.   In that event, it is at least possible the National Party wouldform a coalition with the Democrats, agreeing to speed up reform inexchange for support on legislation.   For now, however, Nationalist candidates are contemptuous of thenew party, saying it is manipulated by militant anti-apartheidorganizations.   ``Radicals and revolutionaries decide for them,'' said Law andOrder Minister Adriaan Vlok.   The Democrats have three leaders, who agreed to a troika afterthe unification of three anti-apartheid parties was completed inApril.   According to opinion polls, the most widely favored of the threeis Denis Worrall, a former ambassador to Britain who quit theNational Party to protest the slow pace of reform. The other leadersare Zach de Beer, a former corporate executive, and Wynand Malan, aformer National Party member of Parliament who now leads theDemocrats' most left-wing faction.   ``Ordinary South Africans are hungering for a change,'' Worrallsaid at a recent rally. ``They want to vote for the Democratic Partybecause they know that in that way they are sending a message to ourfellow black South Africans, and the international community, thatwe are ready to say goodbye and good riddance to apartheid.''   On the key issue of black political rights, the Democratic Partyplatform calls for negotiations with all factions _ including theoutlawed African National Congress guerrilla movement _ to draft anew constitution.   ``The DP constitution will protect our nation's various cultures,religions and languages and will prevent majority domination,'' theplatform says. ``At the same time, it will allow every South Africana vote of equal value.''   It calls for creation of a decentralized federal system and theadoption of a bill of rights.   The National Party has scoffed at the Democrats' professedopposition to ``majority domination.''   ``A federal system means majority rule in every federal state,''said Acting President F.W. de Klerk, the National Party leader.``Minority interests couldn't be protected. ... It can result in theend of democracy.''   One problem for the Democratic Party is that militantanti-apartheid factions have little respect for it. Most blackactivists, and white militants who work with them, oppose the entireparliamentary structure because it excludes the black majority whileoffering token power to Asians and people of mixed race, classifiedas coloreds, who have their own separate chambers in Parliament.   The Mass Democratic Movement, a coalition of several majoranti-apartheid groups, has been particularly critical of theDemocrats' decision to field candidates in races for the Asianchamber. Militants have consistently called for boycotts ofelections for both non-white chambers since they were created in1984.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Mon AMs, Aug. 28</NOTE></DOC>
