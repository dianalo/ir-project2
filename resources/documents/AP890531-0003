They said boats carrying 745 refugees entered Hong Kong watersTuesday and a vessel with 109 people was towed to Tai A Chau, anisland 20 miles southwest of Hong Kong, because other facilitieswere filled.   Tai A Chau has virtually no shelter.   ``We have had more than 2,300 arrivals over the past three days.Our accomodation resources have simply been overwhelmed,'' saidHong Kong refugee coordinator Mike Hanson.   He said the people taken to Tai A Chau would have to stay aboardthe boat or on the dock. ``There is one school building which somepeople may be able to use, but I think most will not be able tohave covered accomodations,'' he added.   The refugees will remain on the island until the government canfind a place for them and then process them, Hanson said. He saidhe did not know how long that might take.   Malaysia, the Philippines and Hong Kong received hundreds ofthousands of Indochinese boat people after communist forcesdefeated the U.S.-backed governments in South Vietnam and Cambodiain April 1975.   But thousands of Vietnamese are still fleeing their homeland.   A year ago Hong Kong adopted a screening policy that treats allIndochinese refugees as illegal immigrants subject to repatriationunless they can prove they fled political persecution.   But that has not curbed the influx.   For the first five months of this year 13,182 boat people havearrived in Hong Kong.   Vietnam has agreed to attend an international conference onIndochinese refugees that is to be held in Geneva June 13-14.</TEXT></DOC>
