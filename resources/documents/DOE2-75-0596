The examination appears to be appropriate to evaluatethe therapeutic success in oesophageal diseases and as a screening procedureto exclude functional impairments of the oesophagus in cases of questionabledysphagia or thoracic pain of unknown origin. The procedure is more sensitiveand less invasive than the radiological and endoscopic procedures usuallyapplied up to now. The documentation of results should include both qualitativeand quantitative parameters because only a combination of these two parameterscan largely eliminate the frequent impairments and artefacts. Documentationin the form of condensed images and the calculation of a residual condensationhave proven to be simple and advantageous procedures.</TEXT></DOC>
