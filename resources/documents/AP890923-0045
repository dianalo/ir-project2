Leaders of the Council on State Governments, here for a three-dayconference, were scheduled to vote today on a proposal to float twoconstitutional amendments intended to return power to the states.   One would have the courts settle disputes between stategovernments and Congress, and the other would allow states toinitiate amendments to the Constitution.   If the council, which consists of about 175 legislators,governors, attorneys general and state judges, decides to back theamendments, the proposal would be forwarded to the National Councilof State Legislatures.   If that 8,000-member group approves the proposed amendments,members could begin seeking congressional approval in early 1990, hesaid.   ``This is where it really starts moving,'' Ohio Senate PresidentStanley Aronoff, a member of the council, said Friday.   Utah Senate President Arnold Christensen, chairman of thecouncil's executive committee, said he expects the proposedamendments to win approval easily from the council. ``I haven'theard of any opposition,'' he said.   A resolution approved Friday by the council says the changes areneeded because Congress has intruded on state and local governmentpowers by requiring states to offer certain programs withoutproviding federal funds to pay for them.   Aronoff, a Republican, said an amendment calling on the courts tosettle federal-state disputes is needed because the U.S. SupremeCourt has ruled such disputes are purely political and aren't courtmatters.   The proposed change in the process for amending the Constitutionwould let a three-fourths vote by states enact constitutionalamendments. Those amendments would take effect unless Congressvetoed them within two years.   Currently, constitutional amendments can be proposed by atwo-thirds vote of both houses of Congress, or put forth by aconstitutional convention called by the legislatures of two-thirdsof the states. In either case, amendments must be ratified bylegislatures in three-fourths of the states.</TEXT></DOC>
