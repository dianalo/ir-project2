LOUIS -- General Dynamics Corp. said that it couldface up to $500 million in additional pretax losses from thecanceled A-12 attack plane program if it is ultimatelyunsuccessful in its legal challenge against the government.   The disclosure came in the company's latest annual report,which was just mailed to shareholders.</LP><TEXT>   General Dynamics and its partner on the A-12 project,McDonnell Doulgas Corp., are challenging the Pentagon'sdetermination that they defaulted on the contract to buildthe aircraft, which was beset by cost overruns and scheduleslips. The contractors are hoping the courts will determinethat the government canceled the contract for its ownconvenience.   The dispute is likely to take years to resolve.   General Dynamics already has taken $700 million in pretaxcharges on the A-12, plus it has erased $24 million inearnings previously recorded on the program. The company saidthe estimated additional loss doesn't include interest thatmay ultimately be payable to the government.   McDonnell Douglas, also based in St. Louis, indicated inits annual report released last month that it could face upto $850 million in additional losses on the A-12, on top ofthe $350 million in write-offs it already has registered.   The Pentagon has said it is entitled to $1.35 billion incompensation from the contractors for work paid for but notperformed. It has agreed, however, to wait to collect thatmoney until the legal challenge is resolved. The contractors,meanwhile, are in the process of submitting claims to recoverabout $2 billion from the Pentagon.</TEXT></DOC>
