The securities and oil-trading firm surprised analystsFriday by announcing that it anticipated a fourth-quarterloss of $30 million, double the year-earlier loss of $15million. While many analysts had recently trimmedexpectations for Salomon's earnings, they hadn't forecast aloss.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;This is probably the bottom&quot; for Salomon's earnings andthey should get better, said Guy Moszkowski, abrokerage-industry analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein andamp; Co. &quot;Iwould just say it's a worse bottom than expected.&quot;   The Salomon news depressed shares of other Wall Streetfirms that are about to announce earnings. PaineWebber GroupInc., Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. and Morgan Stanley Group Inc. allretreated from recent gains, as did Bear Stearns Cos., whichhas already posted record results. Salomon fell $1 to $29.75.   Salomon blamed the expected fourth-quarter loss on itsPhibro Energy Inc. oil-trading and refining unit, whichanticipates a pretax $60 million loss that reflects plungingoil prices. But the flagship Salomon Brothers securities unitalso struggled. Salomon said the unit had a &quot;modest&quot;fourth-quarter profit -- less than $40 million before taxes,analysts estimated -- at a time when other major securitiesfirms had robust results.   Remarkably, Salomon's full-year 1991 net income will stillbe slightly more than $500 million, according to the firm.That would be Salomon's third-best year despite theTreasury-bidding scandal that has dogged the firm sinceAugust. (The record was $557 million in 1985.)   Salomon's actual results aren't expected to be disclosedbefore Feb. 6.   Phibro Energy's anticipated loss results from thewrite-down of the Greenwich, Conn., unit's oil inventories.Crude oil prices plunged 30% in 1991, sending the marketvalue of Phibro's inventories below what the firm had paidfor them. Phibro has taken such charges before. Analysts saidthe underlying business itself broke even, as it had allyear.   As for the Salomon Brothers disappointment, executives atthe firm said it wasn't just a post-scandal loss of business.The unit's earnings always gyrate from quarter to quarterbecause of its big trading positions. Also, major customersthat had fled Salomon amid the scandal, such as the WorldBank, have only recently begun coming back. &quot;Clients are sortof deciding the worst is over,&quot; said Mr. Moszkowski ofSanford C. Bernstein. &quot;But none of that happened until late&quot;in the fourth quarter.   Salomon Brothers still anticipates pretax 1991 earnings ofmore than $1 billion, a record, even after a previouslyannounced scandal-related charge of $200 million. But most ofthose earnings came early in the year, before the scandalhit.   Separately, Salomon continued to shuffle traders andresearchers world-wide, responding to a wave of departurescaused by sharp cutbacks in year-end bonuses.   In London, Salomon appointed Gary Wolens head of Europeanequity sales, succeeding Peter Clarke, who left last week.Also, Kermit L. Schoenholtz of the Tokyo office was named topeconomist in London, succeeding John Lipsky, who has beennamed New York-based chief economist. Simon Thorpe left ashead of the gilt department, succeeded by Andrew Duthy andRobbie Uniake.   Meanwhile, Stephen D. Gray succeeded Ralph Fletcher, whoresigned, as head of Salomon's private-placement group. Mr.Gray is a six-year veteran of the group.   Among other recent departures: Simon Meadows, head ofinternational bond syndication, left to join CS First BostonInc. in London; Christian Broburg, a fixed-income salesman,left for S.G. Warburg and Co.; and Aidan Freyne, a salesman onthe less-developed-countries debt desk, left for BankersTrust New York Corp.</TEXT></DOC>
