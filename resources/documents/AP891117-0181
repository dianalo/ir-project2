Mrs. Marcos faces federal criminal fraud and racketeeringcharges, and her trial is scheduled to begin March 14 in New York.Her husband, exiled former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos,faced the same charges but died Sept. 28.   They were accused of siphoning nearly $200 million from theircountry's treasury and stashing it in the United States.   Mrs. Marcos has lived here since February 1986, when a popularrevolt ended her husband's 20-year rule and sent them into exile.   She is under an Immigration and Naturalization Service orderthat prohibits her from leaving the Hawaiian island of Oahu. She isalso required to meet weekly with a probation officer.   Bartko said he was ``in the process'' of submitting a formalrequest to U.S. authorities to allow the trip and said he wasconfident it would be granted.   ``They'll want to know where she is, who she's with, where she'sstaying,'' Bartko said. ``She'll have to check in, but that's not aproblem.''   Bartko said Mrs. Marcos needed to review more than 300,000prosecution documents her defense team has compiled. She would alsohelp compile witness lists, review testimony and generally preparefor her trial.   Bartko said Mrs. Marcos also might seek to meet with attorneysin New York and that no return date was set.   The government turned over an additional 6,000 documents lastweek and the defense has petitioned prosecutors for more, he said.   ``The sheer task of understanding all of the documents demandsmore than putting this stuff in your briefcase and flying toHawaii,'' Bartko said.   It would be Mrs. Marcos' first trip to the mainland since herOctober 1988 arraignment in New York. She pleaded innocent and wasfreed on $5 million bail.   Donald Radcliffe, the INS district director here, said therequest must be submitted at least two days before the planneddeparture. He refused to say if he thought it would be approved.   Roger Peyuan, Mrs. Marcos' spokesman, said she would stay withher daughter, Irene Araneta, in Woodside, Calif., and hoped to beback in Honolulu by Christmas.   Bartko refused to discuss any defense team negotiations withgovernment prosecutors.   ``I just wouldn't tell you about that,'' he said. ``For thosenegotiations to be productive, they must be kept private.''</TEXT></DOC>
