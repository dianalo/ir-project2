 &quot;My neighborsaid I should use dBASE to automate my business,&quot; he recounts.andP;  &quot;I wasn'tablie to get Lotus to print the kinds of reports I wanted for my clients.&quot;andO;Jones, now the proud owner of dBASE IV, isn't a computer novice.andP;  &quot;I've beenusing Lotus for years.andP;  But when I saw dBASE manuals, I realized I didn'thave time to learn it myself.andP;  What should I do now-sign up for one of thoseseminars?&quot;andM;Does this sound familiar?andP;  Whether you're like Jones or the &quot;database guru&quot;he's confiding in, today's database decisions are harder than ever.andP;  If youfind yourself saying, &quot;I wish I could keep better track of...&quot; or if you seemto be buried in an avalanche of paper, a database manager might make yourlife easier.andP;  Database managers are programs (or collections of programs)that let you set up and maintain information.andP;  Most people use databasemanagers because they want to be able to retrieve data more efficiently thanthey're currently able to, or because they want to create sophisticatedreports based on the data.andP;  People use database managers to print out mailinglabels, keep track of sales leads, monitor inventory or shipments--any numberof information and data management chores.andM;So why not just keep track of things with a word processing package or aspreadsheet?andP;  Well, in some cases those alternatives work just fine.andP;  Let'sassume, for example, that you keep your master customer list in a wordprocessing document.andP;  The minute you try to alphabetize that list, or sort itby zip code, you're in trouble.andP;  Or let's assume that you're off to Miami andwould like to know which of your customers are in that area.andP;  Although youcould use your word processing package's search feature to find all the FLslisted for state, it wouldn't be easy to get a print-out of just thoseclients.andM;On the other hand, many people use spreadsheets to keep track of things.andP;  Irecently spoke with the safety officer of a Dallas trucking firm who waskeeping all the trucks' records in Lotus.andP;  He found he wasn't able togenerate the sorts of management reports he wanted.andP;  He needed a databasemanager to do the job.andM;The choicesandM;It used to be relatively easy to categorize the database management system(DBMS) market.andP;  On one side we had micro DBMSs like dBASE II and Condor; onthe other side we had systems such as IDMS, IMS, Adabas, Image, and DB2 thatran on larger systems.andP;  Oh, sure, we had categories of products, like therelational, hierarchical, or network models, but, given a single hardwareplatform, it was fairly easy to come up with a comprehensive list of thedatabase managers that would run on it.andM;Today, even given a single type of hardware, your list isn't likely to beshort.andP;  And, in the micro arena at least, there's probably no single industryguru who could confirm that your list was complete.andM;In this article I'll look at several categories of database managementsystems.andP;  Although my round-up isn't exactly a database encyclopedia, itshould provide you with a decent overview of the types of products you haveto choose from.andM;Ground floor opportunityandM;Not long ago, flat file managers were perfect for simple list management.andP;  Ifyou needed to keep an address database for mailing labels and form letters,for example, flat file managers were generally the simplest, cheapest, mostefficient way to go.andP;  And that's still probably true.andP;  If your needs arelimited to keeping track of one thing (e.g., addresses or employees ormagazine articles), a flat file manager will probably fit the bill.andM;Most of today's flat file managers have incorporated some of thesophisticated features of their more powerful multi-file and relationalcounterparts.andP;  They include application generators (a feature that lets youcreate code automatically to handle some data management task), fairlypowerful error-trapping mechanisms (so that you can't enter a 19th centurydate as a current employee's birth date, for example) and programminglanguages with built-in functions (which can provide you with moreflexibility in creating applications and performing complex calculations).andO;Some even support limited multi-file features or give you &quot;natural languageprocessing&quot; capability.andP;  (Instead of having to enter &quot;SELECT FNAME LNAME FROMSALESFORCE WHERE SALESTOT andless; FORECAST,&quot; you might be able to type &quot;Show me thelaggards.&quot;)andM;Symantec's Qandamp;A is the leader in the flat-filer market, but SoftwarePublishing's Professional File, Borland's Reflex, Ashton-Tate's Rapidfile,Buttonware's PC-File, and Alpha Software's Alpha/3 also have significantfollowings.andP;  (Alpha also has a new, multi-file system called Alpha/4.)andP;  Ofcourse, many spreadsheet users take advantage of the database features oftheir packages, so the flat file DBMS category could also include the likesof Lotus 1-2-3, Excel, and similar products.andM;The next step upandM;&quot;Life used to be easy,&quot; sights dBASE/Clipper/FoxBASE developer Marv Adams.andO;&quot;Everyone had heard about dBASE II, and when I went to talk to potentialclients, everyone sort of expected that the work would be done in dBASE.&quot;andM;Although dBASE III PLUS, dBASE IV and work-alikes dominate the PC DBMSmarket, a slew of other products can also do the job.andP;  DataEase, Informix,Oracle, Paradox, and R:BASE are the industry heavyweights.andP;  Other notableproducts include Clarion, D The Data Language, DataFlex, Magic PC, Progress,Revelation, and XDB.andM;Multi-file and relational DBMSs expect you to organize your data intospreadsheet-like tables which may be called relations or files.andP;  Each tablehas a theme, so a typical business might have separate tables for clients,invoices, shipments, inventory, orders, and so on.andP;  The collection of thetables constitutes a single logical database.andP;  Most often, these productsinclude a programming language that enables you to create a specificapplication catered to your way of doing business.andP;  That means you can workwith the product out of the box, or use the language to set up menus,reports, etc.andM;A relational database is a special kind of multi-table system, designedaround principles established by Dr. E.F.andP;  Codd in the early 1970s.andO;Relational databases process data in sets using SQL, the language created atIBM and now considered an industry standard.andM;The advantages of relational databases include ease of querying and ease ofdeveloping and modifying applications.andP;  And, because they have become anindustry standard, SQL and relational databases promote data distribution onlocal area networks, minicomputers and mainframes.andP;  This means that in theyears to come, PC workstation applications will be able to manipulate remotedata almost as easily as if it were on a local hard disk.andM;Network/Hierarchical DBMSsandM;Not all DBMSs are based on the popular relational model.andP;  In the mainframeand minicomputer arena, you're likely to run into non-relational DBMSs.andO;Although you generally have to be a programmer (generally a C programmer) touse these packages, aficionados swear that the pay-off in terms ofperformance makes the increased development effort worthwhile.andP;  Major networkand hierarchical vendors are all working on application generators thatminimize the amount of programming needed.andM;Popular micro packages based on the network model include db_Vista from RaimaCorp. and KnowledgeMan from mdbs, Inc. Information Builders' FOCUS is theonly widely-used DBMS in the micro world based on the hier-archical model.andO;However, even FOCUS is becoming more like relational DBMSs withrelational-like cross-references between segments in different hierarchiesand the creation of view-like virtual tables.andM;Should you even consider a non-relational DBMS?andP;  That's a hard question toanswer, since the industry as a whole seems to be moving towards therelational model.andP;  If you're a programmer who insists on the best possibleperformance, perhaps yes.andM;Advocates of hierarchical or network DBMSs point out that there's aperformance penalty for the relational DBMSs' ease of use.andP;  Thegeneral-purpose search algorithms included in a relational DBMS won't beoptimized for specific searches.andP;  Programmers who set up network orhierarchical databases, on the other hand, can write code that optimizessearch strategies for specific queries.andP;  &quot;Relational DBMSs have too manycompromises built into them,&quot; says one db_Vista user.andM;Image DBMSsandM;Sergeant Thomas works in the criminal investigations department of a majormetropolitan police department and he remembers the days when he'd do almostanything to avoid getting a fingerprint assignment.andP;  A &quot;fingerprintassignment&quot; meant you got some prints from the scene of a crime and had to gothrough thousands of dog-eared file cards looking for a match.andP;  Today's imageDBMSs make the task a &quot;whole heck of a lot easier.&quot;andP;  All Thomas needs to dois use a scanner to digitize the crime scene prints and ask the image DBMS tofind potential matches.andP;  Then he can view the prints from the scene of thecrime side by side with the potential matches the system finds.andM;Image DBMSs are optimized for working with graphical databases.andP;  Although thenumber of products available in this category is still fairly limited--andoften specialized--image database management systems are currently being usedfor a multitude of jobs.andP;  Banks use them to compare signatures and storeimages of checks.andP;  Museums and archaeologists use them to keep track ofinventories and finds.andP;  Beauty salons have packages that can simulate aclient's appearance with a new hair style.andP;  Hospitals store X-rays and clientcharts as part of a client &quot;record.&quot;andM;Several problems are associated with image databases: the lack ofstandardization of image file formats; the different media (compact disc,video disc, or video tape in addition to standard disks); the size of imagefiles; implementation of editing; and cost.andP;  To understand the problemsassociated with standards, think about the videotape market; imagine thateach video player manufacturer had its own proprietary format for storingfilms on videotape.andP;  Today, there are only two &quot;standards&quot;: Beta and VHS, andthat makes life complicated enough.andP;  In the image database market, lack ofstandards may mean that once you start using a certain vendor's image DBMS,you'll be &quot;locked into&quot; that vendor's product.andP;  You may not be able to linkthe image DBMS system with other systems, nor share information.andM;Products in the graphics DBMS category include: Crowninshield Software'sMediaBase, Opus I from Roykore Software, PC Album from PC MAnager, DataEase'sImag-In, and Precision, Inc.'s Superbase 4.andP;  CAD (Computer Aided Design) andmapping systems can be thought of as special forms of image DBMSs.andM;HypermediaandM;Hypermedia is probably best described by example.andP;  Unlike a book, wherematerial theoretically progresses in a linear fashion, a &quot;hyperdocument&quot; is acollection of computer files (which may include digitized images stored onCD-ROM or other media) that users can view in a variety of ways.andP;  Thehyperdocument creator establishes links and cross references.andP;  Depending onthe complexity and completeness of the links, the information in thehyperdocument can be traversed in an almost infinite number of ways.andM;Imagine that you go into a travel agency, sit down at a computer terminal,and pick France off a menu of travel destinations.andP;  Now you're presented withanother menu with all sorts of choices for information about France: itsclimate, demographics, history, art, museums, wines, etc.andP;  Or you can selecta particular region or city and find out about its climate, hotels,restaurants, museums, and so on.andP;  Theoretically, you should be able to wanderthrough a web of interrelated data that consists of both text and images.andP;  Ifyou were looking at an image of the Mona Lisa (since it's in the Louvre), youshould be able to satisfy your curiosity about Leonardo and the Renaissance,for example, thanks to hypermedia.andM;Apple Corp. now bundles the program HyperCard with all new Macintoshes, and ahealthy market for the HyperCard hyperdocuments (called stacks) has emerged.andO;The PC world has been slow to embrace hypermedia, probably both becausetraditional relational DBMSs are so entrenched among PC users and because PCsdon't do graphics as well as Macs do.andP;  Nevertheless, several PC products arecurrently available (notably Guide 2 from Owl Corp. and PC-Hypertext fromMaxThink).andP;  A bevy of hypermedia products are in the pipeline:Brightbill-Roberts' HyperPad, Asymetrix' hypercard-like applicationgenerator, AutoDesk's yet unnamed product code-named &quot;Hypergrid,&quot; and DigitalImage Systems' GRID.andM;IBM's recent, relatively unheralded release of its hyper-document package,LinkWay, priced at only $110, may lend credibility to the hyperdocumentmarket.andP;  LinkWay was developed at Western Washington University's West Center(in Bellingham, Wash.), an IBM-sponsored research and development center thatfocuses on educational needs.andP;  Bob Balas, a French professor at Western whohas worked with the product throughout its development, says LinkWay lets youset up a series of multimedia text and/or graphics files and create ahyper-access program.andP;  Hypermedia promises to be especially appropriate foreducational and training needs.andM;Text-based DBMSsandM;Dr.andP;  Louise Barclay, like most clinical psychologists, takes notes duringsessions with her clients.andP;  In the past, she would schedule about an hour atthe end of each day to complete the onerous task of transcribing those notesinto more complete handwritten clinical write-ups for patients' folders.andO;Although those paper files were fine, finding a particular reference wassometimes difficult.andP;  Barclay's problem of massive, variable length &quot;records&quot;(the length of her notes for a given session would vary widely) isn'tuncommon.andP;  Her solution, after frustrating attempts to use traditionalrelational DBMS technology, was to adopt a text-optimized DBMS package.andM;Text retrieval and text-based DBMS packages generally combine features fromboth the word processing and DBMS worlds and are optimized for dealing withunstructured, or variable-length, data.andP;  Packages include askSam Systems'askSam, ZyLab's ZyINDEX, and DayFlo Software's DayFlo Tracker.andP;  Today,Barclay uses a word processing package to write up the clinical notes andstores each session as a separate file.andP;  She relies on ZyINDEX, for example,to find every instance in which &quot;John S.&quot; was talking about his relationshipwith his &quot;mother.&quot;andM;Database/expert systemsandM;Expert systems are a category of artificial intelligence that attempt tocapture the expertise of one or more individuals and translate that intorules.andP;  Once the expertise is captured, a novice can refer to the expertsystem, to help, for example, diagnose a carburetor malfunction or make adecision about granting credit to a customer.andM;If you're using, or considering using, expert system technology, youundoubtedly realize that one of the components of an expert system is somesort of knowledge base.andP;  Depending on the problem your expert system issupposed to tackle and the expert system package you select, you may or maynot want to access existing database information.andM;&quot;Our [expert system] package scanned through literally thousands of records,analyzed patterns, and came up with rules for extending credit,&quot; says NormSinclair, MIS manager for a chain of jewelry stores headquartered in LosAngeles.andP;   Although expert systems for analyzing credit-worthiness can beconstructed a variety of ways, Sinclair explains, the advantage to using apackage that could access the firm's existing database was that &quot;the systemcame up with rules none of us had ever thought of.andP;  Our system found, forexample, customers almost never wrote bad checks for first purchases of over$5,000.&quot;andP;  Sinclair hastens to add that humans can always override the adviceof the expert system, but he says, &quot;90 percent of the time, it's right on.&quot;andM;Database serversandM;Database servers are probably going to be the foundation of DistributedDatabase Processing (DDP) for the next few years.andP;  These sophisticateddatabase management systems run on local area networks providing databaseservices to a variety of front-end applications.andP;  Because the clientapplications and the database server are separate, data can be distributedthroughout the network, and even on minicomputer and mainframe databases.andO;The design of database servers offers other advantages which include improvedperformance, greater reliability, and improved database security.andM;Imagine the information nightmare of a manufacturing facility.andP;  Departmentsin the organization maintain their own databases.andP;  When members of onedepartment need data from another department, they may not be able to get it.andO;At best, the data transfer is probably very slow.andM;With traditional database management systems, processing occurs entirely  atthe workstation.andP;  For example, when you issue a query, your DBMS retrievesthe entire database from the network file server and processes it in theworkstation's memory.andP;  This drags every record across the network wire,resulting in bottlenecks and poor network performance.andP;  Database serversshare database tasks, processing queries at the network file server andsending only the results back to the workstation.andP;  Like today's local areanetworks (LANs), database servers will be able to communicate with otherdatabase servers, thus providing connectivity among diverse systems indiverse locales.andM;If you can envisage your organization's users accessing multiple databases ondifferent sorts of computers in a variety of locations--or if you'reconcerned about today's LAN bottleneck--you'd be well advised to learn allyou can about database servers.andP;  (See my March 1989 article, &quot;ServerTechnology: Divide to Conquer,&quot; for a detailed look at servers and serverissues).andM;SummaryandM;Today's database market is complex and dynamic.andP;  New technologies are beingassimilated into traditional database packages.andP;  Links are being forgedbetween databases and expert systems, between physically dissimilar databasesresiding on different platforms that may be thousands of miles apart, andbetween the database and graphics world.andP;  As you ponder your databasedecisions, you'll probably need to consider the implications of some of theselinks.andM;You'll also want to keep track of standards or emerging standards such as SQLand market share, which amounts to establishing de facto standards.andM;Ultimately, database management systems exist to make us more productive, andgenerally, they do.andP;  But we can sure spend a lot of time educating ourselvesabout them, agonizing over purchase decisions, and finally, learning how touse them, before those productivity gains are realized.andM;In today's Information Age, getting accurate information to decision makersin a timely fashion is crucial.andP;  A database manager may well make thedifference between your organization's thriving, merely surviving, or...andM;Karen Watterson has just begun a year-long sabbatical from her teachingduties at Shoreline Community College in Seattle.andP;
