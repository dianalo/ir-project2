A split three-judge panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appealshere ruled that the petitioners lacked legal standing to challengethe Nuclear Regulatory Commission's decision to allow continuedimportation of uranium hexafluoride from South Africa.   The NRC's 1987 decision was challenged by seven members ofCongress, four private organizations and two individuals, includingan unemployed uranium miner and an anti-apartheid activist.   The petitioners had contended that the NRC failed to enforce theanti-apartheid sanctions passed by Congress in 1986 that forbidcontinued importation of South African uranium and uranium oxide.   The NRC had decided that the sanction law did not ban uraniumhexafluoride, a gas that is used to power nuclear reactors.   Circuit Judge Laurence Silberman wrote for the court. But JudgeMilton Pollack filed a concurring opinion to express his uneasinessover whether legal standing should be the basis of the ruling.   Judge Ruth Ginsburg, who dissented on the standing question, andPollack said they would uphold the NRC decision on the ground theagency properly interpreted the anti-apartheid statute as allowingcontinued importation of the radioactive chemical.   Ginsburg contended that the anti-apartheid activist, Henry Isaacsand TransAfrica Inc., a group that opposes white minority rule inSouth Africa had standing in the case.   The congressmen who challenged the NRC decision were: Reps.Ronald V. Dellums, D-Calif.; Mervyn M. Dymally, D-Calif.; William H.Gray III, D-Pa.; Edward J. Markey, D-Mass.; Charles B. Rangel,D-N.Y.; Bill Richardson, D-N.M. and Howard Wolpe, D-Mich.</TEXT></DOC>
