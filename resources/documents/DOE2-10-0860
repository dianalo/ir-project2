Sliced-based reflective displays are the mostcommon type. Means of producing surface descriptions both via voxel setsand via slice contours are reviewed. Advantages of and means of transparentdisplay to allow the appreciation of the 3D relationships among objectsare set forth. Ways to produce additional depth cues by stereoscopy andthe kinetic depth effect are discussed, and the importance of interactivemodification of viewpoint, clipping plane, displayed objects, etc. areexplained. A new device, UNC's Pixel-planes, for accomplishing this inreal time are illustrated. Voxel intensity based display methods avoidthe need for time-consuming predefinition of object surfaces and thuscan allow exploration of 3D image data. Varifocal mirror hardware andfast computation of one or more projections based on object probabilitiesare two of the more important approaches. While 3D display provides importantinformation about 3D relationships, it cannot provide the kind of appreciationof subtle grey-scale changes that 2D display can. Methods that can combinethese two kinds of information by superimposing 2D grey-scale sliceson or in the context of 3D displays are discussed. Applications of thesetechniques for both diagnosis and radiotherapy planning are used as illustrationsand guides to the usefulness of these techniques with CT, MRI, and other3D medical imaging modalities. 24 refs.; 5 figs.
