The plan would limit claims of health benefits to areas whereonly scientific evidence shows an interaction between diet andhealth, FDA spokesman Bill Grigg said Friday.   That means companies would be allowed to make claims based onevidence that dietary fiber and low fat may reduce risk of cancerand heart disease and low sodium may help reduce risk from highblood pressure, he said.   Grigg said any claims would have to make clear that the food waspart of a total balanced diet.   The FDA used to prohibit health claims on food, but in 1987 putinto effect a rule that it now says has proved to be too permissiveand has allowed companies to make overly broad health claims.   Over the last two years, manufacturers' health claims about therole their products play in reducing disease have proliferated.   The FDA's proposal is being reviewed by Louis Sullivan,secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, whichincludes the FDA. Sullivan is expected to approve the plan and sendit to the White House Office of Management and Budget, whichreviews all regulatory proposals.   If OMB clears the proposed rule, it could be a year beforepublic comment is gathered and a final rule published, said Grigg,who added that ``to some extent the industry would probably followit'' even before the rule was made final.   FDA's proposal is a revised version of a 1988 proposedregulation that failed to win OMB approval.</TEXT></DOC>
