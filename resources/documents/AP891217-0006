(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A suspended county judge accused ofrunning the rural courthouse like a fiefdom was convicted ofbribery and official oppression Saturday but acquitted of openlewdness and three other counts.   Suspended Cambria County Judge Joseph F. O'Kicki, who rose frompoverty to win his first judicial election 18 years ago, showed noemotion as the verdicts were read after 16{ hours of deliberationsover two days.   O'Kicki faces a maximum term of 26 years and $57,500 in fines.No sentencing date has been set. On sentencing, he will lose his$80,000-a-year job and his pension.   O'Kicki said he will appeal.   ``This verdict today is a sad day for the justice system inPennsylvania,'' O'Kicki said. ``The sad day for O'Kicki was Oct. 8,1988, when he was suspended.''   Prosecutors said the 59-year-old judge used fear and favors torule the elegant 19th-century courthouse in the foothills of thesouthern Allegheny Mountains in eastern Pennsylvania.   O'Kicki maintained that the charges were prompted by his feudwith a Johnstown political power broker who has family ties to thelieutenant governor.   The judge was convicted of six counts involving the acceptanceof $500 from a court employee for a promotion that never came;asking a Johnstown attorney for $500 after a favorable ruling; anddemanding a favorable settlement on a bank loan.   Charges included official oppression, demanding property tosecure employment, criminal coercion and bribery. All are felonies.   He was acquitted of charges of requiring court employees performpersonal chores for him on county time, of open lewdness forallegedly asking two secretaries into his office while he waswearing only his underwear, of using inside information about anestate in a money-making scheme and of seeking a bribe from aJohnstown strip-mining company.   O'Kicki also faces a second trial on 16 additional chargesfocusing on private business dealings. No date has been set forthat trial.   The prosecution and defense called 82 witnesses and introducednearly 200 pieces of evidence. Testimony began Nov. 7.   O'Kicki, who prided himself on streamlining the county's civilcourt system, was suspended by the state Supreme Court in June 1988and was indicted in March.   During two days of testimony, O'Kicki blamed his legal troubleson Johnstown millionaire W.E. Schonek, the politically influentialfather-in-law of Lt. Gov. Mark Singel.   According to O'Kicki, the millionaire was angry at him forencouraging Schonek's brother, Rudolph, to make a stock gift worthmore than $200,000 to St. Francis College in Loretto.   O'Kicki said Schonek yelled threats at him about the gift in1987 at a Johnstown-Cambria County Airport restaurant.   Schonek and Singel have denied influencing the investigation.   Northampton County Judge Richard Grifo, who presided over theseven-week trial, told the jury that the investigators' motiveswere irrelevant.   O'Kicki sat impassively through the testimony with his secondwife, Sylvia, at his side, but he said the trial was physically,emotionally and intellectually devastating.   On the stand, O'Kicki denied the charges as his attorney askedhim about them one by one, answering many of the allegations, ``No,absolutely no.''   He broke down in tears once when he referred to his empty homefollowing his divorce from his first wife, Theresa, in 1986.   After unsuccessful bids for district attorney's office andCongress, O'Kicki, a Democrat, was elected judge in 1971 bydefeating the endorsed Democratic candidate in the primary and thenwinning the general election.   He won a retention election for a second 10-year term in 1981and was elected president of the Pennsylvania Conference of TrialCourt Judges two years later.   O'Kicki reached the pinnacle of his success in June 1988 bybecoming president of the five-judge county court but a stateinvestigation into his dealings already was under way.   Defense attorney Richard Galloway indicated that in the appeal,he will make an issue of the trial judge's refusal to declare amistrial after an unusual development.   When jurors were asked to state their verdicts individually,James C. Miller of Johnstown said he disagreed with the other 11jurors on three of the six convictions. Although an unanimousverdict is required, Grifo rejected Galloway's mistrial request,saying he didn't hear any discrepencies.   Miller, reached at home afterward, said he agreed with the otherjurors' conclusions, although it appeared to courtroom witnesses hehad disagreed when the jury was polled.   ``I absolutely did,'' he said when asked if he concurred in theguilty verdicts.</TEXT></DOC>
