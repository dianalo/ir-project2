(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Firefighters andequipment were redistributed Friday to prepare for wind gusts up to60 mph, while fires kept two small towns evacuated and the oldestnational park mostly closed to visitors.   Saturday ``may be the worst day since this entire episodebegan,'' U.S. Forest Service official Brian H. Avery said Friday.``We're trying to prepare for that today, because tomorrow will betoo late to prepare for it.''   Elsewhere, a firefighter battling a blaze that doubled overnightto 27,500 acres in Glacier National Park and adjacent forest innorthwestern Montana was killed by a falling, burning tree,becoming the first death directly attributable to this year'sforest fires.   That blaze destroyed 15 homes and dozens of outbuildings andburned structures at two ranger stations, a bridge and severalhistoric cabins.   Last month, a helicopter involved in battling a blaze inWyoming's Bighorn National Forest crashed after losing power,killing a passenger, a Bureau of Land Management technician.   Meteorologists had been predicting that an advancing weatherfront would produce extremely high winds during the weekend inYellowstone but might also bring some rain or snow by Monday.   A revised forecast Friday no longer anticipated any rain orsnow, Avery said at a briefing on fire conditions.   ``We see no direct relief in site and we are anticipating majorfire activity,'' Avery said, adding that ``probably in excess of150,000 acres'' could be burned by wind-whipped flames.   Emphasis shifted from the Old Faithful complex, which should be``in reasonably good condition'' because Wednesday's firestormburned an area around the perimeter that should provide a bufferagainst any further major burning there, Avery said.   The Clover Mist fire ``is our No. 1 priority currently,'' Averysaid. By Friday it had burned more than 263,000 acres in thenortheast quadrant of the park and the adjacent Shoshone NationalForest.   ``We're looking at (fire danger to) a lot of structures in theClark's Fork of the Yellowstone River and also in Sunlight Basin,Sunlight Creek,'' he said. ``Many ranches and a few lodges downthere are going to need some additional protective measures.''   The sparsely populated Sunlight Basin in the national forest wasevacuated Friday afternoon as flames threatened ranches.   Thirteen fires burned almost 1.2 million acres as of Friday inthe Greater Yellowstone area, and 11.5 million acres of nationalparks and forests in Wyoming, Montana and Idaho. In 2.2million-acre Yellowstone itself, 816,225 acres have burned.   Fires also burned Friday in Alaska, California, Colorado, Idaho,Utah and Washington.   So far this year, 68,396 fires in the West have burned 3,799,550acres, including just over 2 million acres in Alaska, in whatfederal officials have called the worst fire season in 30 years. Atthe same time last year, 49,492 fires charred 1,272,412 acres,according to the Boise Interagency Fire Center, which coordinatesthe fighting of forest fires in the West.   The fire center has said said more than 25,000 firefighters wereat work, but spokesman Arnold Hartigan said Friday that numbercould easily stretch to 30,000 with military and support personnel.   Secretary of Agriculture Richard Lyng, Interior Secretary DonaldHodel and Undersecretary of Defense William Howard Taft IV were toarrive in Yellowstone on Saturday to inspect conditions.   Lyng, Hodell and Taft are to visit Old Faithful geyser, where afirestorm Wednesday destroyed 17 buildings, and fly over the townsof Cooke City and Silver Gate, Mont., at the northeast corner ofthe park.   In Washington, D.C., President Reagan signed legislation Fridaydesigned to pave the way for Canadian assistance in fighting thefires. The measure, passed by Congress on Thursday, authorizesmutual agreements with foreign fire organizations for wildlifeprotection.   Residents of Cooke City and Silver Gate, who were among 150people evacuated Tuesday, were allowed back in for a short timeThursday but were told to leave again Thursday night because of thedanger of the approaching 151,000-acre Storm Creek-Hellroaring fire.   ``We're back into another critical situation,'' fire informationofficer Bob McHugh said Friday.   The drain of battling the fire began to take its toll onfirefighters, said Nick Tafoya, another information officer. ``Alot of crews are quitting because they're tired, fatigued,'' hesaid, but had no figures on how many crew members were affected.   Yellowstone's north and west entrances were open Friday, but theonly attraction at the west gate was fishing on the Madison River,said park spokeswoman Robbie Brockwehl.   Officials closed the last open lodging facility in the park forthe season Friday, the Mammoth Hot Springs Inn, as the 222,000-acreNorth Fork fire moved to within three miles.   Elsewhere, Forest Service prepared a weekend assault on aneastern Utah blaze that had blackened 12,000 acres of AshleyNational Forest and destroyed five homes and cabins. An estimated50 families had evacuated, officials said.   Oregon's Department of Forestry barred the public from nearly 1million acres of forest because of extreme fire danger, bringing to9.5 million acres the amount of state, private and federal landclosed in Oregon. Last year, 10.3 million acres were closed.   Near Entiat, Wash., the state's biggest forest fire jumped aroad that firefighters had hoped would stop it, destroying a barnand forcing the evacuation of three families. The Dinkleman Fire,which grew by 3,000 acres to 40,000 acres, already had destroyedcritical winter range for mule deer and bighorn sheep, officialssaid.   In Idaho, officials closed part of the Salmon National Forestdue to a 30,000-acre fire. Gov. Cecil Andrus said that if mattersworsen, a full-scale closure could be ordered.</TEXT></DOC>
