 The public is more aware ofenvironmental concerns, and politicians love to take on the big battlesinvolving polluters because they get big media coverage for it.andO;Environmental-control regulations and enforcement have gotten tougher andmore consistent.andM;Starting in 1986, the Community Right-to-Know Act forced firms to provideheightened public reporting of their hazardous-waste handling.andP;  Combine thisimportant federal law with the expanded powers of the U.S.andP;  Department ofLabor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and theEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA), and you'll find a lot of companiesgetting serious about on-line environmental software.andM;In their simplest form, spreadsheets and PC-database packages help track theprogress of organizational inputs, processing, and outputs of hazardousmaterials.andP;  An inherent problem with a fragmented, PC-based record-keepingsystem is the difficulty in combining records to get a total picture ofcorporate performance.andP;  Because regulations change frequently, updating allthe systems reflecting tougher controls is costly and error-laden.andM;Still, it's impressive to look at some of the PC-based packages.andP;  A goodpackage provides an integrated information database that must be maintainedfor OSHA, EPA, and other regulatory agencies in accordance with the ResourceConservation and Recovery Act, the Superfund Amendments Reauthorization Act,and other regulations.andP;  Knowledge about several thousand chemicals is storedin such systems; emergency-handling procedures are usually included.andM;Most on-line environmental software packages do an adequate job of creating,storing, and reporting the numbers of materials tracking.andP;  Unfortunately,they don't analyze, warn, interpret, or otherwise help the user understandhow things are shaping up.andP;  Into the picture steps Al.andM;Al and the environment can interact in three ways: Al can help design cleanerproducts or processes, detect environmental violations, and improveenvironmental projects.andP;  Let's start with the most intriguing of the threemeans.andP;  of interaction-Al used to design cleaner products or processes.andM;GREEN ENGINEERINGandM;One of the catchy phrases making the rounds is  green engineering, whichmeans engineering work that incorporates environmental friendliness inproduct and process design.andP;  Keep in mind that changing a product or processto make it environmentally sound comes with a price.andP;  Firms are underpressure to make profits and must weigh the costs and benefits ofincorporating green engineering.andM;Still, green engineering is on the rise.andP;  For example, sophisticatedcomputer-aided design systems notice that a product could be redesigned toenhance recyclability by using composite materials.andP;  A system to develop anautomobile manufacturing line realizes that the waste to be discardedcontains a hazardous chemical that must be separated before entering awater-discard stream.andM;In these examples, an expert system applies environmental domain knowledge toa product's creation or to a process that makes a product or provides aservice.andP;  Thus, rather than waiting until a product is produced, we canreduce the amount of monitoring and cleanup needed by ensuring the system isenvironmentally secure beforehand.andM;CATCHING THE BAD GUYSandM;Al can also monitor and control environmentally smart software.andM;For example, the EPA has sponsored expert-system projects that handleemergency response to toxic.andP;  spills.andP;  TSDSYS is an expert system thatidentifies contractors specializing in the treatment, storage, and disposalof hazardous waste.andP;  HASP identifies the level of protective clothing neededfor an emergency site.andP;  LABSYS analyzes samples to determine their degree ofcontamination.andM;Such software is divided into disaster-managenient phases:andM;* Preparedness (before an accident)andM;* Response occurs after the hazard has occurredandM;* Mitigation tries to reduce life and property lossandM;* Recovery helps after the hazard has taken its toll.andM;Expert systems are modeled on the knowledge used by each respective domainspecialist in the four disaster-nianagement phases.andP;  A comprehensive expertsystem then tries to tie the others together.andP;  The use of expert systems andcomputer-based support across the four phases is sporadic, and much of thedisaster-management area remains ripe for software solutions.andM;BIG PROJECTS CAN BE DONEandM;Al can also affect the environment by its use in large public utility systemssuch as water, heat, power, and waste disposal.andP;  In South Florida, an expertsystem was developed to help the water-management district operate itsstorage facilities and canal network.andP;  The Operations Assistant and SimulatedIntelligence System (OASIS) attempts to combine meteorological forecasts,historical statistics, field observations, and other information to helpprevent flooding and ensure a good supply of water.andP;  Al historians willrecall that the nuclear-power industry has been a long-time supporter of Altechnology.andP;  The Accident Management Expert System was developed in themid-1980s for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and its desire to cope withpotential nuclear-plant accidents.andM;WHAT ABOUT USandM;Recent dangers associated with long-term exposure to display tubes or VDTshave made computing a bit more serious, as has the rise of carpal tunnelsyndrome  injuries caused by repetitive motions in stationary positions suchas typing).andP;  Computer factories use cleaning solvents dangerous to air,water, and humans.andP;  Laser printer release ozone, computers burn energy whenthey're left on paper waste is monumental.andP;  The list goes on.andM;Some companies have adopted the slogan &quot;reduce, reuse, and recycle&quot; whenmanaging computer resources.andP;  They may urge employees to do what they can toconserve and protect the environment, including using electronic mail insteadof paper memos and recycled paper for printouts.andM;Al can help allocate resources.andP;  Systems that design office arrangements nowincorporate knowledge about energy consumption, and ergonomic systems try todevelop specific tasks to reduce work-related injuries.andM;This move is encouraging: it will be easier to incorporate environmentalconcerns into corporate consciousness if it can be made part of thecorporation's daily activity.andP;  If a firm has to hire scarce, expensiveenvironmental specialists, he firm is less likely to embrace the cleanlinessissue.andP;  But if Al can help distribute such knowledge and deliver it to thepoint of critical use, a subliminal force may help us all breathe a littleeasier.andM;So get into Al and the environment-you can make money and promoteenvironmental concerns.andP;  I recommend that you do some reading to learn moreabout the topic, approach an environmental specialist (use the referenceslisted or call a local university or regulatory agency), and find a projectthat meets your preferences.andP;  I can't guarantee you'll make big bucks, but atleast you may help save the planet.andM;SUGGESTED READINGandM;Hushon, J. &quot;Expert Systems to Assist First Responders to ChemicalEmergencies.&quot; Expert Systems with Applications II(2), 1991.andM;Leary, M.andP;
