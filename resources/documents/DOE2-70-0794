Results fromthese experiments indicate that the reactivity of these NiAl surfacestoward CO is distinctly different and that although the CO/NiAl (110)behaves more like CO adsorbed on pure nickel surfaces, the CO/NiAl(110)surface is neither like CO absorbed on pure nickel nor aluminum surfaces.The local CO bonding sites, as probed photoemission and electron energyloss spectroscopy, are similar on both NiAl surfaces.</TEXT></DOC>
