(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Violence from opponents of expanded fishingrights for Indians will not be allowed, an official warned Sunday,following seven arrests as crowds gathered to throw rocks and tauntspearfishers.   ``We won't tolerate any type of physical abuse like rockthrowing,'' Department of Natural Resources spokesman John Nelsonsaid. ``We have been tolerating the verbal stuff because peoplehave a right to their opinion, but that does not extend to the areaof physical violence.''   Police in riot gear have patrolled boat landings on the northernlakes where Chippewa Indians are spearfishing under the guaranteeof 19th century treaties. Through Saturday, 67 demonstrators hadbeen arrested since the tribal fishing season began April 23.   The seven arrested Saturday night included four accused ofrock-throwing at North Twin Lake, where a crowd estimated at 1,000people gathered in light snow. No injuries were reported.   Nelson said protesters have thrown rocks in isolated incidentsin the past but never to the degree that occurred Saturday night.   Crowds of more than 100 people have gathered at many lakes atnight when Chippewa fishermen use lights and multipronged spears totake walleyed pike and other fish from northern Wisconsin lakes.   It is the fifth year that Wisconsin's six Chippewa bands havespearfished since a federal court ruled the tribe retained theright to gather food off reservation under treaties that ceded muchof northern Wisconsin to the federal government.   Treaty rights opponents object to rules that allow tribalfishermen different fishing methods and seasons than non-Indiansportsmen. The critics particularly oppose the spears, which aremore efficient than the traditional rod and reel.   In Boulder Junction on Saturday, Gov. Tommy G. Thompson toldbusiness leaders and treaty rights opponents he'll do everythingpossible ``to reduce the suffering and turmoil'' over Indianspearfishing.   ``I know every one of you are completely upset,'' Thompson said.``You're very emotional so am I and I'm very sorry about thesituation.''   The governor unveiled a multimillion-dollar plan to boostnorthern Wisconsin tourism and address business concerns about theeconomic effects of spearfishing, including efforts to stock morepike in northern lakes and to press for a compromise with theChippewa.   In the disturbance at North Twin Lake, about 30 rocks showeredfrom the crowd Saturday night as one of eight tribal boats enteredthe water, said George Meyer, a natural resources departmentadministrator.   Most arrests were for disorderly conduct, but one protester whowas on the lake with a boat was arrested on charges he harassed aspearer by creating a hazardous wake, Nelson said.</TEXT></DOC>
