Lublin (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> PHA </IN><TEXT>   British and U.S. scientists have developed a new screening method for the detection of Down's syndrome, the major cause of severe mental retardation in the industrialized world.    The researchers claim the improved technique could detect more than 60% of the pregnancies affected by the crippling birth defect, roughly twice the proportion discovered by current screening efforts. Many women with Down's syndrome fetuses elect to have abortions.    About 250,000 Americans already suffer from Down's syndrome and about 5,000 more are born with the disorder every year. In Britain, about 900 newborns a year have the defect.    The detection method described in this week's issue of the British Medical Journal &quot;could well be&quot; a major scientific gain, says Dr. Michael Patton, a London geneticist. It will &quot;eliminate a lot more cases of Down's syndrome.&quot;    The new screening also may mean fewer older expectant mothers will need to undergo amniocentesis, a prenatal diagnostic technique that occasionally causes miscarriages. Women aged 35 and older face the greatest risk for bearing a child with Down's syndrome. And the number of pregnancies among this group is growing, reflecting the increase of career women belatedly choosing motherhood. In the U.S., pregnancies among older women tripled between 1978 and 1986.    Fewer amniocentesis tests &quot;will be an enormous benefit to them because most of those (older) women desperately want the pregnancy. And they won't have the risk of losing that pregnancy&quot; from the exam, says Dr. Nicholas Wald, professor of environmental and preventive medicine at the Medical College of St. Bartholomew's Hospital in London. Dr. Wald and nine other researchers in the U.S. and Britain wrote the British Medical Journal report.    Until recently, doctors used only a pregnant woman's age in screening those to test for Down's syndrome. The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, for instance, urges all expectant mothers over 35 to undergo amniocentesis to learn whether the fetus has birth defects. Amniocentesis, which costs about $1,000 in the U.S., involves taking a sample of the fluid surrounding the fetus.    As many as 30% of Down's syndrome cases could be found this way. But in Britain, fewer than half of older pregnant women have amniocentesis -- and so fewer than 15% of Down's syndrome cases are detected based on a woman's age, the British Medical Journal report says.    Dr. Wald and his colleagues say their improved screening involves subjecting women to three new types of blood tests before using amniocentesis to confirm the diagnosis. The blood tests measure the level of various biochemical markers found in a fetus or a mother's placenta. One test, called AFP, has come into use in the U.S. during the past year or two for Down's syndrome detection.    Dr. Wald described the second test's effectiveness in a research paper published in April. With this week's report, he and his co-researchers confirmed the third test's effectiveness at screening for Down's syndrome. Blood samples from 462 pregnant women were examined using the latest test. Of this group, the level of a hormone known as human chorionic gonadotrophin was twice as high on average in the 77 women with fetuses suffering from the defect.    &quot;Our results indicate that it is now possible to screen pregnant women for Down's syndrome using maternal age and the results of simple blood tests and thereby identify about 60% of all affected pregnancies,&quot; the research report says.    More important, &quot;now age alone is no longer the proper criterion for screening for Down's syndrome,&quot; observes Jacob Canick, an a ssociate professor of pathology at Brown University in Providence, R.I., and one of Dr. Wald's co-authors.    But medical practices change slowly, especially in the U.S. At least initially, obstetricians probably will continue to urge routine amniocentesis for older expectant mothers even if the new screening shows only a slight risk of Down's syndrome. </TEXT></DOC>
