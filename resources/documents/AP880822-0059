In the northern city of Mandalay, hundreds of thousands ofpeople, including housewives and children, filled the streets inresponse to student calls for a nationwide protest and a generalstrike, Japan's Kyodo news service said.   Some protesters waved the fighting peacock flag used in thestruggle for independence from Britain in the 1940s.   Many train and bus operators joined the strike, bringing publictransportation to a halt, the report said.   Soldiers closed off key areas of Rangoon and stopped thousandsof demonstrators from marching there, witnesses and diplomats said.   An Asian diplomat said about 20,000 people heeded student callsand rallied outside Rangoon General Hospital in the largestdemonstration in the capital since rioting culminated in theresignation of President Sein Lwin on Aug. 12. There were noreports of violence today in Rangoon.   Sein Lwin was replaced by President Maung Maung, the country'sfirst civilian leader in 26 years.   Kyodo reported from Rangoon that a group of protestors ralliedin front of the U.S. Embassy, saying: ``We want our movement to becommunicated to countries around the world.''   The protesters are demanding an end to one-party rule in Burma.   In the southern city of Victoria Point near the Thai border,thousands of demonstrators marched to the town hall, chantingslogans condemning one-party rule, a senior Thai police officialsaid.   Rebels fighting the government threw their support behind thestudents.   The Asian diplomat said the demonstrators gathered peacefully indowntown Rangoon. He said most shops in the capital were open inthe morning, despite student calls for a nationwide general strike,but closed as the rally began.   The diplomat, who demanded anonymity, said about 10,000demonstrators remained outside the hospital early tonight.   ``When about half of those taking part in the rally set out tomarch, they were blocked by soldiers,'' he said by telephone.   The diplomat was not sure how the marchers were turned away.   A Burmese source reached by telephone in Rangoon said soldiersclosed off parts of the city with barbed wire and other barricades,evidently to block any mass marches.   The source, who requested anonymity, said thousands gatheredpeacefully in front of Rangoon General Hospital, listening tospeeches by protest leaders, and the numbers were increasingsteadily.   The Thai police official said 10,000 demonstrators gathered atVictoria Point, some with red cloths tied around their heads as asymbol of defiance. The market town is in Burma's southernmostprovince of Megui bordering Thailand's Ranong province, and is 490miles southeast of Rangoon.   During the Aug. 8-12 rioting, security forces there turnedagainst the government and gave protesters free reign, Thaiofficials said.   Also today, the Karen Nation Union, one of the strongest rebelgroups, issued a statement in Bangkok declaring support for thestudents and calling on foriegn nations to halt aid to the Burmesegovernment until it ends one-party rule.   Rebels hold large areas bordering Thailand. Last week, BrangSeng, a leader the National Democratic Front grouping 10 guerrillaarmies, also declared the front would join the students fightingfor democracy.   On Friday, Maung Maung, the Western-educated attorney general,succeeded Sein Lwin and became the nation's first civilian leadersince a 1962 military coup toppled an elected government andinstituted one-party rule.   But students and other groups were not satisfied and immediatelycalled for more demonstrations and the general strike today topress demands for multi-party democracy. Diplomats in Rangoon saythe government is highly unlikely to give in to such demands.   Burma has been in turmoil since September, when universitystudents rioted in the most serious student unrest in the countrysince 1974. They were protesting the government's voiding of some60 percent of the currency in circulation, a move that broughtsevere hardship in a nation where the per capita income of lessthan $200 a year is among the world's lowest.   Bloody rioting, increasingly focused on political demands,occurred in March and June, leading to the resignation of Ne Win.   Sein Lwin is said to have personally ordered the suppression ofthose protests.   Under Ne Win, the Burma Socialist Program Party pursued ruinouspolicies of rigid socialism, strict military control andinternational isolationism.   Security forces have not interferred with the demonstrations andafter Sein Lwin's departure, authorities have indicated they willbe much more tolerant of dissent.</TEXT></DOC>
