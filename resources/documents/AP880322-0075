No new negotiations arescheduled,'' said a spokesman on a taped hotline recording today atthe Screen Actors Guild.   The 100,000 joint members of the Screen Actors Guild and theAmerican Federation of Radio and Television Artists called theirstrike Monday against the Joint Policy Committee of the AmericanAssociation of Advertising Agencies and the Association of NationalAdvertisers.   The union rejected a management offer of immediate fee increasesin exchange for dropping a cost-of-living adjustment, andadvertisers refused to accept a proposed ``tiered'' pay system forcable TV commercials based on the number of cable subscribers.   The strike, which affects only radio and television commercials,is the second by Hollywood talent unions in less than a month. TheWriters Guild of America has entered the third week of its walkoutagainst motion picture and television producers.   John A. McGuinn, the chief management negotiator, urgedadvertising companies to hire non-union talent, but some companiessaid they would wait out the strike before beginning new adcampaigns.   ``The ads with non-union actors just won't look as good. It willbe a lot like the replacement players who filled in during thefootball strike,'' said one advertising executive, who asked not tobe named.   The Los Angeles office of the New York advertising firm DellaFemina, Travisano andamp; Partners said it probably will hold off on newads for one of its major clients, Isuzu. Actor David Leisure, whoplays the part of outrageous liar Joe Isuzu, is a guild member.   The striking actors on Monday picketed offices of the Ogilvy andMather agency in Los Angeles and Honolulu. In New York City,strikers set up picket lines at General Motors Plaza during a GMboard meeting. Pickets also walked in Chicago and Miami.   Ken Orsatti, SAG's national executive secretary, sent telegramsto the major candidates asking them to use only ads with unionactors by signing interim agreements with the unions.   McGuinn, however, said the advertising companies ``don't see anyproblem during a strike.''   ``We're producing commercials today; we're producing commercialstomorrow,'' he said. ``We have non-union talent that's willing towork. Our doors are open.''   Meanwhile, there were no talks scheduled between the9,000-member Writers Guild of America and the producers' allianceto end that strike. However, a guild spokesman said scriptwritersare ready to return to the bargaining table.   Scriptwriters have demanded higher fees from foreigndistribution, more creative control and a management proposal torestructure fees for one-hour television shows sold intosyndication.</TEXT></DOC>
