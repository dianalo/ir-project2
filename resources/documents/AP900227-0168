Direct, secret talks? No,'' saidWhite House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater when asked byreporters about the report in the London-based Arab newspaperAl-Hayat. ``Do I expect a breakthrough or anything new happening?No.''   The newspaper said that progress was being made in discussionsamong the United States, Iran and Syria aimed at gaining therelease of foreign hostages in Lebanon.   The newspaper quoted unidentified political, militia andreligious sources in Beirut as saying that Iranian PresidentHashemi Rafsanjani had convinced the groups holding the 18 foreignhostages that they should be released now.   At the White House, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwatersaid, ``We are not aware of the source of these stories or anytalks that fit this description.''   He also said that he would not rule out ``meetings anywhere, anyplace, any time by anybody on the hostage question. Because thereare meetings happening.''   By that, Fitzwater said he meant that the administrationcontinues to follow leads and make contacts in its effort to securethe release of the eight American hostages. He would not bespecific.   Fitzwater also said that despite recent speculation on a numberof fronts, the administration knows ``of no new evidence'' tosupport hopes that the hostages' release might be forthcoming.   ``There are no direct talks between the United States and Iranauthorized by the president,'' he said.   ``I don't know who's talking to who. But I guarantee you I'mnever going to say that nobody's talking, because I know a lot ofpeople are.''   ``There are a lot of people around the world talking aboutrelease of the hostages in Lebanon _ people from other countries,people from other embassies, people on all levels, people we don'teven find out about until after the fact,'' Fitzwater said.   Al-Hayat quoted Algerian sources as saying that contacts were inplace through non-diplomatic organizations and that Algeria wasitself involved.   Diplomatic sources in Damascus, Syria, this week confirmed thatthe United States had a number of channels for reaching Iranianleaders.   Contacts through Geneva were one such conduit, but the UnitedStates most recently has used Syria and Japan to pass messages toIran, said the sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.   The sources said there was not one, specific set of negotiationsunder way between the United States and Iran.   Al-Hayat quoted the leading Shiite Moslem cleric in Lebanon,Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, as saying that he supportedending the hostage crisis, ``and I bring it up in every possibleoccasion because I do not believe in it from the begining.''   An editor at the newspaper said Fadlallah, spiritual leader ofthe Iranian-financed Hezbollah, or Party of God, confirmed that theUnited States and Iran were in contact through third parties.   Some Western hostages are believed held by factions linked toHezbollah.   The Lebanese hostages include eight Americans, four Britons, anItalian, an Irishman, two West Germans and two Swiss.   The longest-held is 42-year-old Terry Anderson, chief MiddleEast correspondent for The Associated Press when kidnapped in March1985.   In London, Anderson's sister, Peggy Say, said of the latestreports, ``I think there have been many, many positive signalsbeing sent and this is one of them.''   The other Americans are Thomas Sutherland, Frank Herbert Reed,Joseph James Cicippio, Edward Austin Tracy, Jesse Turner, AlannSteen and Robert Polhill.   Al-Hayat said the discussions included the fate of four Iranianswho disappeared in Lebanon in 1982 as well as the fate of hundredsof Lebanese and Palestinian prisoners held in Israel.   The release of the hostages was believed hinged to a powerstruggle in Tehran between the pragmatists and radicals in thegovernment.   The pragmatists, seeking foreign investment to rebuild Iran'seconomy after eight years of war with Iraq, are viewed as trying toend the hostage issue to burnish Iran's image.   Two Tehran newspapers said in editorials this week that thehostages in Lebanon should go free, and Chief Justice AyatollahMohammed Yazdi said that Iran opposed taking hostages.</TEXT></DOC>
