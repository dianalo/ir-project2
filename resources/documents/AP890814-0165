Argentina's willingness to temporarily set aside its claim overthe Falkland Islands led to the diplomatic breakthrough, officialssaid, speaking with the condition of anonymity.   None of the officials involved would provide details of the talksunder way in New York.   But one diplomat said ``we cannot deny that the situation is verydynamic, and something could happen in the next few days or weeks.''   Diplomatic relations were severed in April 1982 when Argentinainvaded and occupied the Falkland Islands, a British colony since1833. British forces recaptured the islands off Argentina's southerncoast in a 74-day war.   Argentines call the islands the Malvinas and claim they inheritedthem in 1810 after declaring independence from Spain.   Argentina never formally declared an end to hostilities in theFalklands War. It has refused to allow British planes or ships touse Argentine ports or to allow British companies to bid onArgentine public projects.   Argentina also banned British products from its markets butlifted restrictions earlier this month. Britain earlier removed asimilar ban on Argentine imports.   Britain has said it wants to normalize trade relations withArgentina, negotiate a fishing agreement, re-establish air links andreduce tension.   Argentina's new president, Carlos Menem, took the first steptoward restoring ties shortly after his inauguration in early July.Previously, Argentina had said talks would have to start with thesovereignty issue.   Menem's government would like to recover fishing rights in thearea around the Falklands. Britain currently enforces a 150-mileexclusion zone around the islands.</TEXT></DOC>
