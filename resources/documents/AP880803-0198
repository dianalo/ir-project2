The midday ceremony was a highlight of the TV evangelist'seight-day tour of holy sites in Israel and the occupied West Bank.He is accompanied by about 350 followers.   Before the baptism, Swaggart sat on the stone embankment andexplained the significance of the ceremony to his granchildren,Jennifer Kay, 11, Gabriel Lee, 8, and Matthew Aaron, 7.   ``By being baptized, you will be saved,'' Swaggart said asMatthew Aaron fidgeted beside him.   Following the children's baptism, more than 200 of Swaggart'sfollowers formed a line along the embankment, some weeping, to waittheir turn to step into the water. Many wore white robes or dressesover their bathing suits.   ``Do you acknowledge the Lord as the lord of your life?''ministers traveling with the group asked the pilgrims. ``Are youborn again and promise to live for Him for the rest of your life?''   The pilgrims answered ``yes'' before the minisers dipped thembackward into the water. Swaggart only baptized his grandchildren.   ``To be baptized in the Jordan River is an unspeakable joy,''said Anne Marie Murray, 45, of New Haven, Conn. ``I've never feltso close to the Lord.''   ``It's great, very significant because Jesus was baptized in theJordan,'' said a beaming Morris Jones, 51, of Morgan Hill, Calif.,after stepping out of the water.   The ceremony took place in a shaded section of the river on thesouthern tip of the Sea of Galilee that is set aside for baptisms.   According to the Bible, Jesus was anointed by John the Baptistin the Jordan River, but the exact site is not known.   Roman Catholics and other denominations mark the baptism once ayear at river sites near the biblical city of Jericho, about 20miles east of Jerusalem.   Since arriving in Israel July 29, Swaggart and his entouragehave visited Jerusalem, Bethlehem and a nearby Jewish settlement.   Swaggart has said he came, in part, to express support forIsrael which has been the target of international crticism for itscrackdown on the 8-month-old Palestinian uprising.   Swaggart, who runs a TV ministry that reaches 2 million viewersfrom its base in Baton Rouge, La., stepped down from the pulpit inFebruary after confessing to sinning against his wife. A prostitutesaid he paid her to strip and perform lewd acts for him duringvisits to a motel.   Officials of the Louisiana Assemblies of God denominationrevoked his ministry credentials after he returned to the pulpit inMay against their wishes.   Pilgrims on the tour said the scandal has not diminished theirfaith in the Louisiana preacher.   ``We know the sincerity of (Swaggart's) ministry and his workall over the world,'' said Ms. Murray. ``All of us have renewed ourcommitment to support this ministry.''</TEXT></DOC>
