There's no such office, but he thinks there should be.   Jackson actually is running for shadow senator _ an unpaidlobbyist post for D.C. statehood. The crusade has been a magnet forscorn and skepticism.   He's been labeled ``His Shadowship'' by one acerbic commentatorand deemed increasingly irrelevant by another. Futile play-acting,some say. A phony job when he could have had a real one. Outdatedprotest politics outside the mainstream. The kiss of death for athird presidential bid.   ``There's a certain contempt factor in high places,'' Jacksonallows. It doesn't discourage him or dim his customary eloquence.   ``Why D.C. statehood? Why not mayor?'' he asked last week at agathering of Democratic women. ``Because my life commitment is toexpand democracy. My quest is not employment. It's empowerment.''   Later, he says no one expected Lech Walesa or Nelson Mandela tosettle for jobs within the oppressive systems they were trying tochange.   The district is an occupied zone with its single non-votingHouse delegate and limited authority over its own affairs, he says.It's humiliating to have to grab senators in hallways and plead forhelp, he says bitterly _ ``running around as if we had on waiters'outfits, waiting to get what was left over from the dinner.''   There's no question that Jackson feels strongly about D.C.statehood, makes the case well and will win one of the district'stwo shadow senator slots in November.   Yet his choice _ so soon after the electoral triumphs ofVirginia Gov. Douglas Wilder and New York Mayor David Dinkins, sosoon after shunning the D.C. mayoral race _ has puzzled many.   ``The ultimate political irony of 1990 could be the election ofJackson to that artificial position at the same time that formerCharlotte Mayor Harvey Gantt is being elected to a real seat in theU.S. Senate,'' columnist Mark Shields wrote recently.   ``The mayor's job is a real job. To avoid that and run for aphony lobbyist's job ... shows you're interested in playing protestpolitics and not mainstream real politics,'' said Al From,executive director of the conservative-leaning DemocraticLeadership Council.   Jackson says his support for D.C. statehood, part of theDemocratic platform, is ``mainstream Democratic Party politics.''   Challenge his relevance and he mentions the 7 million votes hegot in his 1988 presidential bid. He cites a recent poll that showshim the front-running Democrat for 1992. He talks of the hundredswho come to hear him speak, the unmet needs of the poor anddowntrodden.   ``Public servants are relevant as long as people need publicservice,'' he says.   Yet some observers see Jackson's influence waning with the riseof black politicians like Wilder, North Carolina's Gantt andGeorgia gubernatorial candidate Andrew Young.   ``They seem to be eclipsing him as spokesmen for a broaderpolitical movement. They're not just black politicians andincreasingly it seems to me that he is,'' said Stuart Rothenberg,editor and publisher of The Political Report.   Jackson argues it is racist to compare him to other blackpoliticians and resists the suggestion he is the candidate of onlyone group.   He still talks of rainbow coalitions, including one for D.C.statehood. He sees this mission as a logical extension of his otherefforts to ``expand democracy'' _ registering voters, organizingworkers, protesting apartheid, pushing for new domestic prioritieslike urban reinvestment.   Many agree the shadow senator job is compatible with Jackson'swork, aims and personality. He can keep traveling, promoting hiscauses, earning his living, moving ahead with a syndicatedtelevision show scheduled to debut in September.   And while analysts don't think statehood will expand his base,most don't see him losing support over the issue, either.   But can he get any respect? Will he be taken seriously?   ``It's unlikely that anyone's going to call him SenatorJackson,'' said Linda Williams, a black politics specialist atHarvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government. ``It's going to beextremely difficult for him to be seen as an elected official ...much less a senator. He's really got a hard sale.''   But Ann Lewis, an adviser to Jackson's 1988 campaign, saidJackson has always made the most of his opportunities and ``ifanybody can make the job work, he can do it.''   At least six states _ Tennessee, Michigan, California,Minnesota, Oregon and Alaska _ sent shadow senators to Washingtonbefore they became states, according to the Senate historian'soffice. The first and last to be granted access to the floor of theSenate were the Tennesseans, in 1796.   ``That's precedent,'' said Jackson, who is seeking the sameprivileges for the two D.C. shadows. Counters From: ``It's aterrible precedent to let a lobbyist pretend he's a senator.''   When it became clear that D.C. Mayor Marion Barry was going tobe preoccupied with his drug and perjury trial, many looked toJackson to run for mayor. He could heal the city, they said. Hecould gain experience in an elective office.   Had Jackson gone that route, Democrats would not now bewondering how to handle this formidable ``shadow.'' And to therelief of party moderates and conservatives, he would have beenotherwise engaged during the 1992 presidential race.   But Jackson has never bowed to or become part of the party orany other institution. And so he is still at large, seeminglyeverywhere _ marching with strikers in Las Vegas, organizingtextile and chicken workers in the South, protesting the savingsand loan bailout in Chicago, welcoming Mandela in Washington,exhorting Democrats in Iowa and Indiana.   What he'll be doing in 1992, he won't say.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Mon AMs, July 23</NOTE></DOC>
