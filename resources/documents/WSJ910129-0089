Some of the trades were ahead of hefty customer orders,including one in which the broker traded ahead of a 200contract crude-oil futures trade representing about 200,000barrels of oil, CFTC enforcement director Dennis Klejna said.That would indicate that the customers, which the CFTCwouldn't name, were either large institutional customers orpossibly oil companies.   The CFTC charged David Rousso of Hoboken, N.J.; NeilMcGoldrick of Garden City, N.Y.; Richard Henriksen ofBrooklyn, N.Y.; Kathleen Farley of New York; William Reidy ofChicago; as well as RIS Commodities Inc. of New York andGerald Inc. of Chicago.   Edmund Schroeder, an attorney for Gerald Inc., said, &quot;Thecompany will deny any wrongdoing.&quot; The other firm and theindividuals couldn't be reached.   The agency said that in the six-month period, the fiveindividuals executed 148 illegal transactions. In the seventrades ahead of customer accounts, Mr. Klejna said, thebrokers made about $4,000 of profit. He said he didn't knowhow much profit the brokers allegedly made from the othertransactions.   In the May 1989 probe, federal investigators swarmed theNew York futures exchanges, seizing records and issuingsubpoenas to as many as 50 futures traders. The CFTC hasbrought charges against traders at the New York Merc and theCommodity Exchange.   Mr. Klejna said the agency staff plans to recommend thatthe commission authorize charges against additional peopleinvolved in the New York inquiry. &quot;This is an ongoinginvestigation,&quot; he said.</TEXT></DOC>
