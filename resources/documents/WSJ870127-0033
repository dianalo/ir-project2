But David Abshire's thoughts often return to the Atlantic alliance, where he has worked since 1983 -- and they aren't particularly sanguine.    The outgoing diplomat (his term here at NATO headquarters lasts until Saturday, although he's already in Washington doing a damage-control job for President Reagan) does believe NATO functions a bit better than before. He even takes some of the credit. Yet he fears that momentum may be lost, that NATO could lose effectiveness in the years just ahead, unless Europeans -- as well as Americans -- challenge some &quot;cherished assumptions.&quot;    But there's no certainty they'll do so, and NATO's ability to serve as Western Europe's main defense might weaken. Possible causes include Soviet smiles and general boredom.    The leading problem, according to Mr. Abshire, is to convince member states that NATO remains worth improving in this age of superpower negotiations and Gorbachev friendship campaigns. Solving it involves publicity as much as gunnery. He wants a greater lobbying effort to persuade Europe and North America that the alliance is still essential and must be upgraded -- though this will cost an inconvenient amount of effort and money.    But neither Europeans nor Americans seem especially eager. Some even contend that conventional defenses are adequate, or are growing irrelevant. &quot;Not so,&quot; insists Mr. Abshire, who believes enhancing NATO's capabilities is of &quot;accelerating&quot; importance.    Looking ahead to the 1990s doesn't make him any more complacent. Like most officials at NATO, he doesn't see much chance of actual war, though he'll rattle off statistics about Soviet arms superiority whenever an audience seems impressed. But he does worry about possible Soviet &quot;blackmail&quot; -- Moscow's potential ability to use military pressure against the West for political or economic gain.    Payoffs to Moscow by the West could range from softening human-rights policies to extending cheap loans to relaxing technology controls. The available Soviet instruments include its North Sea navy, its mobile armored forces in Central Europe and its array of conventionally armed tactical missiles. Whether such &quot;blackmail&quot; would ever be sensible or possible is arguable, but officials like Mr. Abshire don't want Moscow to have the ability to try.    So what to do?    Reflecting in Washington, Mr. Abshire puts great stress on an improved NATO sales campaign -- selling itself. This means going beyond conventional diplomatic and military groups and beyond rounding up the usual suspects who are already true believers. He thinks member governments must persuade politicians and publics of several things: The threat is real, NATO must be strengthened and much can be done by spending available cash more efficiently.    Like others enmeshed in the NATO bureaucracy, he doesn't seek a gun-for-gun, dollar-for-ruble arms race. But he wants more push behind certain existing programs. These include increased standardization of weapons (NATO uses four quite different -- and costly -- main battle tanks), unified research and development (&quot;you'll go broke letting technology run in all directions&quot;), plus selective extra spending in key spots (NATO's northern German forces are short of ammunition).    &quot;We've got to convince people they're wrong if they think these things don't really make a difference,&quot; the ambassador says.    Mr. Abshire also says the NATO mission of the U.S. must be as the lead salesman, with Congress -- increasingly stocked with skeptics -- as its first target. If the Americans disengage even partially, it isn't likely that other NATO states will fill the vacuum; at best, the alliance would merely limp along.    There is also the boredom factor. For many, NATO is one of those subjects that get labeled as DBI -- dull but important. Arousing enthusiasm for bigger ammunition depots or common usage of rockets is hard to do. In fact, they fight closing down inefficient factories and importing other people's weapons; jobs and votes are at stake.    Yet results are possible. With restrained modesty, Mr. Abshire takes much credit for congressional votes against withdrawing U.S. troops a few years ago, and for funding joint military research with Europeans. He hopes others will continue such battles.    It isn't necessary to buy all the Abshire arguments to give him general support. But many NATO flaws could be repaired by more intelligent spending, without budget increases. Doing so would strengthen the Western hand as diverse talks with the Soviets proceed. Negotiating from weakness -- especially with Moscow -- has never been a wise tactic, and that won't change soon. </TEXT></DOC>
