Covariancematrices can be singular, and the positive definite character is notguaranteed. The effective rank (according to some slightly differentdefinitions) could be much lower than the number of groups determiningthe dimensions of the matrix. Owing to reasons of numerical precisionin the calculations correlation matrices are preferred to covariancematrices. (author). 3 refs, 1 fig., 5 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
