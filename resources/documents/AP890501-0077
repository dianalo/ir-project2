A statement from the president's press office Sunday said thegovernment was extending the cease-fire to achieve ``firm andlasting peace in the region.''   The statement, broadcast over the government-controlled Voice ofNicaragua radio, said the extension of the cease-fire was agreed toduring meetings among the five Central American presidents inFebruary.   At the two-day meeting in El Salvador, President Daniel Ortegaagreed to push for democratic reforms in his country and moved uppresidential elections by 10 months, to February 1990. Thepresidents also agreed to come up with a plan for dismantling theanti-Sandinista rebel forces, known as the Contras.   Referring to the rebels, the government statement said extendingthe cease-fire would ``create conditions for the demobilization,relocation or repatriation of the Nicaraguans who have beeninvolved directly or indirectly in armed activities.''   Some 11,000 Contra rebels, along with their families, live inHonduran camps near the Nicaraguan border.   Nicaragua signed a temporary cease-fire with the Contras inMarch last year and the truce was to be the basis for a permanentpeace accord but talks to extend it stalled. The Sandinistas haveunilaterally extended the temporary cease-fire monthly since June,when the original one expired.   The government statement said the cease-fire extension ``wouldnot affect the general plans for defending the nation or repellingcriminal attacks by the mercenary forces, which continue to bloodyour country.''   Despite the cease-fire, Sandinista officials and the rebelscontinue to blame each other for offensive attacks.   Meanwhile, the weekend edition of the Sandinista party newspaperBarricada quoted Sandinista army Lt. Col. Ricardo Wheelock, chiefof intelligence, as saying fighting between government andguerrilla forces increased in recent months.   Wheelock told the newspaper that during the first four months ofthis year, there were 403 rebel attacks, resulting in 43 Sandinistadeaths and 75 injuries. Three Sandinistas were reported missing.   Wheelock said the rebel forces, in ``attacks they haveprovoked'', have suffered 193 deaths. He said the Sandinista armycaptured another 89 rebels during the four-month period.</TEXT></DOC>
