Warren Lavorel told a meeting of the General Agreement onTariffs and Trade that the Bush administration regarded the currentGATT round of trade-liberalizing talks as the ``last chance in thiscentury to make far reaching improvements in the way the worldtrading system operates.''   The meeting of negotiators from GATT's 96 member countries alsoset the deadline for the end of the talks, which were launched inUruguay in 1986, GATT Director-General Arthur Dunkel said.   Dunkel said a ministerial meeting to adopt the final package ofmeasures to liberalize international commerce would take place inBrussels between Nov. 26 and Dec. 8, 1990.   He told a press conference that completing agreements to cutbarriers to trade in agriculture, textiles and intellectualproperty rights such as patents and trademarks would be the mostdifficult as many governments would have to change domesticpolicies to comply with the new rules.   These areas caused stalemate when ministers met in Montreal lastDecember to assess progress at the halfway stage of the UruguayRound.   Negotiators are also drawing up new agreements for tropicalproducts, services like travel and construction, tariffs andsubsidies that are alleged to distort trade.   In a speech to the closed session of the GATT meeting, Lavorelsaid the United States was committed to multilateral talks to solvetrade disputes.   ``We remain firm in our intent to work through the Uruguay Roundin order to solve our most vexing trade problems. We view theUruguay Round as the preferred means of solving the verytroublesome and very real trade problems faced by U.S. industry andagriculture,'' he said.   A copy of the speech was made available to reporters.   The United States was criticized by many countries forundermining the GATT's multilateral principles when it announced inMay a hit list of three countries accused of being unfair traders.   Citing a controversial section of the 1988 trade act, the Bushadministration threatened to take retaliatory action against Japan,India and Brazil if they did not agree in bilateral talks to removethe offending barriers to U.S. exports.   In addition to drawing up trade-freeing agreements, GATT alsoacts as a forum for settling disputes. Its members account forfour-fifths of world trade.</TEXT></DOC>
