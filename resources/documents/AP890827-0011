SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Researchers have found lightning to be an evenmore widespread danger than was believed, with more than five dozenAmericans losing their lives and hundreds more injured by lightninglast year.   A hazard whose scattered victims usually attract only localnotice, lightning finally made the national headlines in 1988 bysparking forest fires that ravaged much of Yellowstone National Park.   In the past, weather observers have recorded the presence oflightning through the simple expedient of listening for the thunderthat comes after the electrical discharges.   But electromagnetic detection systems have discovered that,because of interference with sound waves, between 22 percent and 40percent of all lightning occurs without observers hearing thethunder that follows.   That is not good news, researchers note, pointing out thatlightning can strike with no warning, sometimes occuring prior tostorms or reaching out ahead of the clouds.   Detailed thunderstorm records go back to the late 1800s, but theyhave always depended on the reports of trained observers, primarilylistening to thunder. This means that the operators of electricalplants and others who use weather records to anticipate the dangerof lightning have underestimated the risk.   The toll of 68 lightning deaths in 1988 was the same number as in1986, tying for the lowest in this decade. In between, however, 1987recorded the most in the decade with 86 fatalities.   The long-term average is 96 lightning deaths annually, an averageboosted by several very deadly years back in the 1960s, including1963 when 210 people were killed by lightning.   As usual, in 1988 many victims were in the open or under trees,with several on golf courses or in boats. Florida retained its placeas leading in lightning deaths with nine, while six died in Colorado.   There were four lightning deaths in Georgia, Michigan, New York,North Carolina and Wisconsin, the National Weather Service reported.And states with three fatalities were Minnesota, New Mexico, Texasand Virginia.   Alabama, Kansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and PuertoRico had two lightning deaths each. States reporting one fatalitylast year were Arizona, Connecticut, Kentucky, Nebraska, Nevada, NewHampshire, New Jersey, Ohio and South Carolina.   More than half of all electrical storms had only a fewcloud-to-ground lightning flashes, while a small number of stormshad hundreds of strokes.   Indeed, in Washington, D.C., three years worth of records showedthat nearly one-quarter of all the lightning strokes were accountedfor in just two big storms.   One reason lightning doesn't get the respect that meteorologiststhink it deserves is that it is like automobile accidents, usuallyclaiming victims one or two at a time over a scattered area.   The sudden arrival of thousands of volts of electricity, however,can sometimes involve a lot of people.   For example, on July 17, 1988, lightning struck a utility pole ata speedway in Snyder County, Pa. Twenty-two spectators were injuredby the charge which traveled down the pole and into the bleachers.Happily, no one was killed.   On July 10 of last year a group playing volleyball in New York'sProspect Park wasn't so fortunate. Seeking to avoid a suddendownpour, they sought shelter under a tree. Lightning struck,killing a 28-year-old man and injuring a dozen others.   Lightning results from a buildup of electrical charges in a stormcloud. The process isn't fully understood, but is appears to involvemovement of raindrops up and down in the cloud, propelled by strongwinds.   When the electrical charges build up to large levels an invisible``step leader'' moves down from the negatively charged cloud base insegments about 50 yards long, until it reaches the positivelycharged ground.   When that contact is made, thousands of volts of electricity movein that circuit _ often in several ``bolts'' giving lightning itssometimes flickering character.</TEXT></DOC>
