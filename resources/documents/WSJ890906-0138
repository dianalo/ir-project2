The contracts follow filings ATandamp;T made last Friday with the Federal Communications Commission under a special arrangement called Tariff 12. The tariff, which has been fought by ATandamp;T's competitors, is a regulatory device that enables ATandamp;T to sell custom-designed phone and computer networks to big customers.    The announcements also mark the beginning of a marketing effort by ATandamp;T to get more media attention for large contracts it signs. An ATandamp;T spokesman said the company is trying to persuade more big customers to participate in making such announcements.    &quot;When MCI or the other guys make a sale, they stand up and say so,&quot; said James Byrnes, an ATandamp;T spokesman. &quot;Now we want to, too.&quot; MCI Communications Corp. and US Sprint Communications Co. have received much attention, mostly in the trade press, whenever they sign up a big customer. Contracts with big customers have helped ATandamp;T's competitors gain credibility in the market.    ATandamp;T also wants to time its announcements when contracts are signed instead of when filings are made at the FCC. Fearing red tape and public disclosure, some customers have shied away from ordering custom services from ATandamp;T because ATandamp;T, unlike its competitors, must get them approved by the FCC.    To gain more residential customers, ATandamp;T also said it will waive the $5 sign-up fee for its Reach Out America discount plan until the end of the year. The telephone giant said it is also increasing discounts under the plan.    Reach Out America customers pay $8.70 a month for an hour of weekend and night out-of-state calling. Customers also get discounts on evening and daytime calls.    Separately, US Sprint said it will reduce rates for its digital private line service by 28% beginning Nov. 1. The service, called T-1 in industry jargon, gives customers the equivalent of 24 voice channels on a single line. </TEXT></DOC>
