The leftist guerrillas, however, assured the nation's nearly 1.8million voters they will not be attacked if they go to the polls.   The incumbent Christian Democrats hope to keep control of thepresidency, but they face a serious challenge by the right-wingRepublican National Alliance, known as Arena.   A leftist political alliance on Saturday accused the military oftaking part in a smear campaign against it, but the military deniedthe charge.   Ruben Zamora, coordinator of the Democratic Convergence, saidabout 100 posters condemning convergence members as ``communistexecutioners'' were plastered Friday night along one of thecapital's main avenues.   Col. Galileo Torres said ``no armed forces unit put them up'' andthat the military was ``keeping strictly to the sidelines in thepolitical process.''   A broadcast by the rebels' clandestine Radio Venceremos saidguerrilla military actions might be intense Sunday but that voterswill not be attacked.   Broadcasts resumed of paid announcements by leftist organizationsthe government considers guerrilla front groups, but the mediaheeded an order from Attorney General Roberto Garcia not to air anycall to boycott the election.   There were no new reports of rebel attacks overnight, but theguerrillas maintained a ban on public transportation and sabotagedelectrical power, affecting the water supply in some places.   Voters who defy a rebel boycott will have a chance to replace anincumbent government with a different philosophy for the first timein their history.   They will be looking for someone who can bring an end to nineyears of civil war that left 70,000 dead and who can right acrippled economy that has an unemployment and underemployment rateof 60 percent.   The three leading candidates offer options from right-wingArena's free market economics and tough stance against theguerrillas to the left-wing alliance, which is linked to theFarabundo Marti National Liberation Front.   Another political choice is to observe the guerrilla boycott. Therebels say they wants to discredit the election to show no solutionto the nation's political crisis is possible without theirparticipation.   Troops began delivering ballots to polling places, butauthorities did not plan to distribute ballots to 24 of nation's 260municipalities because they are under rebel control.   Twenty-one U.S. election observers arrived Saturday. The group,named by the White House, includes congressmen, state politiciansand private citizens.   President Jose Napoleon Duarte's Christian Democrats are tryingto retain power with attorney Fidel Chavez Mena, 49. He has had tofight off accusations of corruption and incompetence against hisparty, which has been unable to end the war or improve the economy.   Duarte is dying of liver cancer. Under the constitution, apresident cannot seek re-election.   Chavez Mena's major challenger is businessman Alfredo Cristianiof Arena. The party was created in 1981 by Roberto d'Aubuisson, aman accused of organizing death squads, links he denies. Many fearhe would be the power behind Cristiani's throne; his party alreadycontrols the National Assembly.   The new political factor is Guillermo Ungo, a former universityprofessor who spent seven years in exile as head of the DemocraticRevolutionary Front, which is allied with the guerrillas.   Four minor candidates are not expected to be significant factors.Cristiani has been leading the latest polls, but the large number ofvoters who express no preference has led many to expect a runoff inApril between Cristiani and Chavez Mena.   The new president will take office June 1 for a five-year term.   The director of one of El Salvador's most respected pollingorganizations denied a newspaper report that it predicted victoryfor Cristiani.   The Rev. Ignacio Martin Baro, head of the Public OpinionInstitute at Central American University, said its March 1 to 15poll did not suggest a winner because too many people refused torespond to questions due to ``Fear _ fear to express a preference.''   Polltakers contacted 1,599 people, he said, but 41.5 percentrefused to indicate who they would vote for and 13 percent did notplan to vote. He said 26.2 percent supported Cristiani, 12.9 percentwere for Chavez Mena and 4.2 percent preferred Ungo.   In 1982 and 1984 elections, Salvadorans voters went to the pollsin large numbers despite the threat of violence by the left.   In New York City, more than 1,200 sign-waving protesters marchedSaturday into Times Square to protest U.S. involvement in ElSalvador.   ``The Bush administration (must) choose between negotiations oran escalation of U.S. military involvement,'' said coordinatorMiguel Ramirez of the New Cork Coalition to Stop the U.S. War in ElSalvador.   The guerrilla traffic ban started at midnight Wednesday, whencampaigning ended by law, and has halted highway traffic in most ofthe country. Guerrillas launched sporadic attacks and called onelection workers to quit.   More than 50 percent of the country was without electricitybecause the guerrillas have destroyed light poles, transformers andpower lines. Phone lines also were down in many parts of the country.   The guerrillas had offered to participate in the election if itwere postponed until September.</TEXT></DOC>
