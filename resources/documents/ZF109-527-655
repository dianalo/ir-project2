(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Lori MeadsandM;As both technology and the corporate work force evolve, it's a budget burdenfor companies to replace PCs every two to three years.andM;This is where modular architecture comes into play.andM;It enables the processing capability of a machine to be upgraded ordowngraded to adapt to specific needs while requiring buyers to make only oneinitial investment.andM;To corporate buyers, cost-effectiveness and flexibility are vital.andM;Scott Yawger, a financial analyst at W.L.andP;  Gore and Associates Inc., aconsumer apparel manufacturer in Elkton, Md., said, &quot;I think going withmodular units actually increases the value of your investment, if you canupgrade inexpensively.andM;&quot;We'll be buying Compaq [Computer Corp.'s] 386/33L with the intention ofupgrading, as opposed to buying a 486/25.andP;  This way, the up-front investmentis much lower,&quot; he added.andM;Briscoe Stephens, a systems manager for the National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration's (NASA's) Marshall Space Flight Center, located inHuntsville, Ala., who uses AST Research Inc.'s Premium, said, &quot;Quite frankly,we can't afford to buy 120 new units every six months to a year.andP;  We wanted asystem where we could start a person out on a low-grade 386SX and move themup gradually.andM;&quot;Not only will we save money over the long haul, but we've got a solid pieceof hardware that can be changed as technology dictates,&quot; he said.andM;&quot;And, if I've got an emergency, I can make real-time corrections with theswap of a card,&quot; Stephens added.andM;Cost is certainly a factor in the purchasing decision, according to otherbuyers, but flexibility and convenience are also important considerations.andM;Paul Goldsmith, a partner with MIS Computer Systems Partnership, avertical-market service management firm in Redmond, Wash., said that usingLaguna Systems Inc.'s PDQ modular architecture computers not only offers hisclients more CPU power and additional memory as needed, but abates fears thattheir investment will soon become outdated.andM;&quot;It's always a fear our clients have when buying hardware that eventuallytheir software won't run fast enough,&quot; Goldsmith said.andP;  &quot;Upgradability erasesthat fear.&quot;andM;At the Industrial Bank of Japan, in Los Angeles, Advanced Logic ResearchInc.'s (ALR's) PowerFlex and BusinessVEISA modular PCs have replaced IBM PS/2Model 70 and Model 50Z machines.andM;According to Paul Bryant, a systems specialist for the bank, it took awhilefor his superiors to feel secure about the vendor swap.andP;  But once they did,they were &quot;blown away by the benefits,&quot; Bryant said.andP;  &quot;I had to prove thatthe ALR units were as reliable as IBM's.andP;  It became readily apparent themachines were easily equivalent to the IBM Model 70, while packing a costsavings of about 50 percent.&quot;andM;Unlike the process of swapping complete machines, upgrading a modular unitcreates no disturbance for the user, Bryant said.andM;&quot;Replacing someone's computer always entails reorientation of the user,&quot; hesaid.andP;  &quot;With modular units, that factor is erased.andP;  You don't disturbanyone's working environment.andP;  It's the same as lifting the hood of a car andreplacing the engine.andP;  You just give it back to the person with moreacceleration.&quot;andM;A Swap for PowerandM;Buyers of each of the reviewed machines were pleased with how easy it is toupgrade processor power.andP;  Some make several card changes a month.andM;&quot;You pop the lid, put in the new processor, and the computer runs four timesas fast as before,&quot; Bryant said.andP;  Using ALR's series of CPU boards for thePowerFlex -- a 386SX/16, a 386SX/20 and a 486 card -- &quot;it takes only a minuteto swap the processor.andP;  You open the box, make the board switch, and themachine does the rest.&quot;andM;&quot;All you have to do with the AST is pull off the front panel and make thecard switch.andP;  It doesn't take a genius -- there's no wire to break,&quot; saidNASA's Stephens.andP;  &quot;It comes in especially handy when we've got someone doinghigh-power calculations.andP;  We can pull in a 486/33 processor to get the jobdone.&quot;andM;Jim Morris, an information systems manager for Dana Corp., a Toledo, Ohio,automotive parts distributor, said initial installation of his Compaq 386/33Lwas a snap.andM;&quot;The EISA [Extended Industry Standard Architecture] Token-Ring card isself-configurable, and the software is also completely EISA-buffered.andP;  Allyou have to do is tell the machine to confirm configuration files, the speedat which your Token-Ring is running, and whether you're using shielded cableor not,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;The machine takes care of the rest.&quot;andM;While buyers of both the Compaq and Laguna systems said they had not yetcalled those vendors for technical support, buyers of systems from both ASTand ALR praised the support provided by the companies.andM;&quot;We're on the AST maintenance contract,&quot; Stephens said.andP;  &quot;If we have aproblem, we just call [AST], and the next day we receive another board.andP;  Theygive you overnight turnaround on parts.andP;  That's unbelievable.&quot;andM;&quot;Advanced Logic's support is always helpful,&quot; said Industrial Bank's Bryant.andO;&quot;I had questions on how to set up extended memory, and not only did they getback to me very quickly, but they knew the product thoroughly.&quot;andM;While the computing demands of corporate users will always vary, for buyersconcerned about cost, flexibility and keeping up with the constant technologychanges, modular systems could be the answer.andM;&quot;I think this type of architecture is imperative for anyone who wants to keepup with technology,&quot; Stephens said.andP;  &quot;As readily as processors are changing,the only way a consumer can keep up without going bankrupt is a modulardesign upgrade.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
