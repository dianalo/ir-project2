(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Greenpeace anti-nuclear activists,their ship damaged by the Navy during a protest last week of aTrident 2 missile launch, said Tuesday they will observe anupcoming launch but will not try to stop it.   ``Our intention is not to physically obstruct the upcomingTrident test, but to exercise our rights to protest ininternational waters,'' said Shannon Fagan, a Greenpeacespokeswoman.   She said a 60-foot-ketch, the Mondeivitano, would sail to thevicinity of the test site later this week ``and will maintain thesame distance from the site as other Navy vessels.''   The Trident submarine launch area is in the Atlantic 50 milesoff Cape Canaveral. During a test launch, the Navy declares a5,000-yard radius safety zone around the sub.   Last week, the 190-foot MV Greenpeace with 25 protesters onboard penetrated the safety zone and dispatched two motorized raftsin an effort to halt a launch from the submerged submarine USSTennessee.   That tactic was successful in July, but last week the Navy wasready. A submarine support ship bumped the Greenpeace several timesand used fire hoses to shoot water down the smokestacks to stop theengines. Small Navy boats corraled the rafts, cut fuel lines andtowed them out of the danger zone.   The Tennessee then successfully launched the Trident 2, theNavy's newest, most powerful nuclear weapon.   In Washington, the Federal Aviation Administration said it isinvestigating another aspect of the Dec. 4 incident in whichGreenpeace operated a helicopter inside the launch area.   FAA Administrator James Busey said that flight ``raises theserious issue of whether the pilot intentionally violated federalaviation regulations'' and said his agency is investigating. Aviolation by a U.S.-registered aircraft could result in the pilot'slosing his flight certificate, the FAA said.   Navy officials would not say what precautions were being madefor the upcoming launch in case protesters again tried to stop it.   The MV Greenpeace suffered one three-foot gash and two smallerones in its hull and will be tied up in drydock for repairs forseveral weeks, Fagan said.   ``They may have dented our ship but not our resolve,'' Fagansaid. She said the Navy overreacted and deliberately rammed theGreenpeace.   ``The issue is not Greenpeace versus the Navy,'' she said. ``Weare, however, against nuclear weapons.''   She said Greenpeace also will stage water-based and land-basedprotest vigils near Port Canaveral where the Tennessee currently isbased.</TEXT></DOC>
