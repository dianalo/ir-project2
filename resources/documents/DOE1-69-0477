Controloperations of special importance in high-energy accelerator facilitiesinclude: control for each area based on measurement of spatial dose rateand surface contamination density; control of radioactive substancesin radioactivated accelerator equipment, waste water and emission; personalexposure control based on measurement of radiation dose to workers; andcontrol of entry and exist of persons. In the High-Energy Research Institute,the control areas consists of entry prohibited areas and entry restrictedareas, and there are warning areas between them. A centralized monitoringsystem combined with stationary monitors (for neutrons, gamma rays) isinstalled to control the radioactivity level in each area. The last partof the report describes some radiation control measures taken in theInstitute for radioactive substances, personal exposure and entrance/exit.(Nogami, K.).</TEXT></DOC>
