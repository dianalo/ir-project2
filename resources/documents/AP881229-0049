The dollar closed at 126.03 yen, up 0.76 yen from Wednesday'sclose and up 4.03 yen from its 1987 year-end closing. It openedtoday at 125.42 yen.   ``Life insurance companies are on stage,'' said Kaneo Ogino, adealer at Goldman, Sachs in Tokyo. He said other traders, reluctantto make large moves ahead of the New Year, largely reacted to activebuying and selling by the life insurance firms.   The dollar began the day on a strong note following overseasgains due partly to intervention Wednesday in the market by the WestGerman Bundesbank, dealers said.   The dollar ``strengthened after the market interpretedWednesday's intervention by the West German Bundesbank as a signalof concern over inflation,'' said one dealer, speaking anonymously.   The Bundesbank, West Germany's central bank, reportedly soldabout $100 million in support of the West German mark on Wednesday,he added.   Dealers said they expected the dollar to remain around thecurrent level for the remainder of the year due to current sentimenttoward the U.S. currency. It has gained 1.31 yen in the last threedays.   ``I think it could go higher,'' Ogino said.   The foreign exchange market in Tokyo will end 1988 trading with afull day of business Friday and will resume trading on Jan. 4.   The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed for the year on Wednesday.
