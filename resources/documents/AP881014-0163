The bad news for consumers has been good news for Northwestfishermen, who have been netting many more dollars for the sameamount of work.   With rising demand but no increase in the harvest, the Japanesehave begun buying other species as well, raising the possibilitythat salmon could be priced off many tables in the Northwest. Inother parts of the country where salmon are shipped, priceincreases could be even higher, Alvorsen said.   ``They're basically buying them for 50-cent dollars,'' said AlecBrindle, president of Ward Cove Packing Co. Inc.   Kings, frequently 20 pounds or larger, and the darker sockeye,usually around six pounds, are prized for their oily, succulentflesh.   Coho, or silver, range from small to intermediate in size andare less oily, while chum, intermediate in size, are drier still.Pinks or humpys, the smallest, run around four pounds and have thedriest and lightest colored flesh. Pinks and sockeye are the mostnumerous.   Some restaurants renowned for their fish dishes have droppedcertain kinds of salmon.   At Ray's Boathouse, executive chef Wayne Ludvigsen said he quitbuying sockeye rather than boost the menu price to $18 or $19. Hehad charged $13 or $14 the past few years.   ``I don't know of anybody else who has it on the menu,''Ludvigsen said.   ``It's become a bad value,'' he said. ``It's almost that themarket was so strong ... that quality was not the thing, justgetting the fish was the thing.''   ``We're reaching price levels that we've never seen before, sonobody really knows what the ceiling is,'' said Bruce Gore,Ludvigsen's supplier of king salmon that runs $16.95 a plate.   Gore, who fishes, cleans and flash-freezes fish at sea from 10other boats and sells about 200,000 to 250,000 pounds a year toretailers and restaurants, predicted top-quality frozen salmonwould reach $10 to $12 a pound at the counter this winter.   ``A growing percentage of people are just going to buy chickeninstead,'' he said.   ``Salmon has probably escalated as fast or faster than anyseafood,'' said Tom Dehn, special seafood merchandizer at PacificFish Co.   Japanese buying was the main reason for the record $705 millionpaid to commercial fishermen for a so-so Alaska salmon catch of99.5 million fish this year.   Salmon hauled aboard boats from Washington state brought fishingcrews about $240 million and processors $525 million for 67,000metric tons of fish this year, compared with $135 million and $297million, respectively, for 66,000 tons in the previous season,Alvorsen said.   Alvorsen said salmon prices pretty much rose with the rise ofthe yen, coupled with a falloff from record catches of themid-1980s and declining frozen and canned inventories.   Chuck Meachum, Alaska Department of Fish and Game researchsupervisor for the Bristol Bay region, said the transition fromcanning chiefly for European countries to freezing overwhelminglyfor the Japanese had resulted in ``a very, very strong correlation... between the price U.S. fishermen are paid and the U.S.-Japanexchange rate.''   Fishermen received an average of $1.40 a pound for 15.8 millionBristol Bay reds in 1986, when the yen was worth about 170 perdollar, and $2 a pound for 16.6 million fish this year, with theyen at 133 per dollar as of Friday.</TEXT></DOC>
