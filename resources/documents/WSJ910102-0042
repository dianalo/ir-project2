Its main street, where residents heroicallyfoiled a bank robbery by Jesse James in 1876, attractsthousands of tourists. Its biggest industry is highereducation and its tallest smokestack soars from the statelyGothic campus of Carleton College. Northfield's motto: &quot;Cows,Colleges and Contentment.&quot;   But over the past 18 months, things have changed so muchthat an art supply store on the town's main street displayeda five-foot papier mache dead cow with its feet in the airand a sign: &quot;Cows, Colleges and Carcinogens.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   What happened? The uproar here was the result of a massiveU.S. government data base called the Toxics ReleaseInventory. The dull-sounding report is raising Cain incommunities throughout the U.S. for a simple reason: For thefirst time, the government is telling local communities who'scausing pollution in their neighborhoods -- and communitiesare shocked.   Here, for instance, residents never suspected SheldahlInc., a maker of flexible electronic circuits for automobilesand computers. The clean, high-tech plant produces notelltale smoke or odors. &quot;We always thought of Sheldahl as agood neighbor,&quot; says Joan Wolf, a poet and editor of aliterary magazine. But then a newspaper reported thatSheldahl, the town's largest employer, was polluting the airwith nearly 400 tons a year of methylene chloride, a widelyused solvent classified as a &quot;probable human carcinogen&quot;although its emission into the air is unregulated. To defusecontroversy, Sheldahl immediately volunteered to reduce theemissions 90% by 1993, but the issue has split the community.   In 1989, the federal government began disclosing thestaggering quantity of toxic chemicals discharged annuallyfrom 20,000 plants across the nation. The Toxics ReleaseInventory lists plant-by-plant emissions of 320 chemicalsbelieved to cause serious health effects -- a total of nearly5 billion pounds of emissions, mostly legal or simplyunregulated. The report tells local citizens what poisons theneighborhood factory is putting out, how much and whetherthey're polluting the air, water or land. The government alsoreports what chemicals are being stored and whether anyspills have occurred.   The information is disclosed under the Emergency Planningand Community Right-to-Know Act, adopted in 1986 after theBhopal disaster in India. &quot;The law empowers citizens to act,&quot;says Charles Elkins, a top Environmental Protection Agencyofficial. &quot;You don't have to be a government expert to asktough questions, such as why a plant pollutes twice as muchas competitors in the same industry.&quot;   The first two annual reports on industry's toxic emissionshave had significant impact. Dozens of Fortune 500 companieshave announced voluntary reductions. Monsanto Corp., forexample, has already reduced toxic air emissions 39% since1987 and expects to meet its goal of 90% by 1992. DowChemical Co. plans to reduce overall emissions 50% by 1995.Du Pont Co. pledges to cut air emissions 60% by 1993 andcancer-causing components 90% by 2000. Chemical ManufacturersAssociation spokesman Owen Kean explains: &quot;The publicincreasingly measures companies by their {emissions} numbersand what they are doing about them.&quot;   In California's Silicon Valley, 2,000 protesters marchedagainst an International Business Machines Corp. plantrevealed in 1989 as the state's worst emitter ofozone-destroying chlorinated fluorocarbons. Right-to-know wasa &quot;significant factor&quot; in IBM's decision to eliminate CFCs atall plants by end of 1993, a spokesman says.   Residents of Springfield, Mass., used the law to find outwhat dangers lurked in plants and warehouses adjacent totheir homes. Companies had to &quot;justify why they were usingdangerous chemicals,&quot; says James Controvich, Springfield'semergency preparedness director. Monsanto, for example,agreed to move 1,000 drums of resins containing flammablesolvents from a public warehouse to safer storage at itsSpringfield plant. Some companies eliminated extreme hazards,such as cyanide, and others corrected dangerous conditions.&quot;The neighborhood is definitely safer,&quot; says the EastSpringfield Neighborhood Council's Kathleen Brown.   Right-to-know also generated public support for tougherlaws. The report showed that air emissions, accounting fornearly 40% of all discharges, are &quot;basically uncontrolled,&quot;says the EPA's Mr. Elkins. In October, Congress closed theloophole by mandating strict controls for 189 toxic chemicalsunder the revised Clean Air Act. In Louisiana, a state thatresisted even minimal regulation, right-to-know promptedpublic outrage and legislative action: In 1989, it adoptedits first comprehensive law aimed at cutting air emissions inhalf by 1995.   A Massachusetts advocacy group used the information toshow that even the state's computer industries, consideredrelatively clean, were major polluters. Massachusetts PublicInterest Research Group led a campaign that resulted in thenation's strongest toxics use-reduction law, designed to cutchemical wastes 50% by 1997. Right-to-know &quot;created awarenessof a real problem that had to be addressed,&quot; says John Gould,president of Associated Industries of Massachusetts.   In Massachusetts, Monsanto and Polaroid Corp. have beenpilloried for the sheer size of their discharges. Polaroid,for instance, has state permits allowing it to send waste toa sewage treatment plant, which in turn dumps treated wasteinto Boston Harbor. Although the company insists this issafe, it faces growing public pressure to eliminate waste.Says a Polaroid official: &quot;We could have a very goodcompliance record and still be accused of being the No. 1polluter&quot; of Boston Harbor. Polaroid pledged to reduce toxicsusage and waste by 10% a year for five years. The companyexceeded its goal in 1989, the first year, partly byeliminating mercury in film pack batteries.   Some companies say emissions figures can be misleading.Hoffmann-La Roche Inc.'s Nutley, N.J., pharmaceuticals plant,for example, ranked among the state's top five polluters inreports released in 1989. But environmental groups failed tonote that nearly three-quarters of the waste was sent to asewage treatment plant and converted to harmless carbondioxide and water, the company says. &quot;You can't just look atemissions totals to measure risks,&quot; says Jack Kace, anassistant vice president.   In any event, the numbers don't answer the most basic andtroubling questions: Are these emissions a health threat and,if so, to whom? Those were the questions that residents herebegan asking -- and searching for the answers.   The flap here started in June 1989, although it took morethan the government's report alone to sound the alarm. TheToxics Release Inventory itself is so thick and obscure thatit's difficult to compare plants or industries without acomputer. Moreover, the report gives no indication of healthrisks. So environmental groups like the Natural ResourcesDefense Council pore through the data and release theirfindings. In 1989, the council listed the nation's biggestemitters of 11 known or probable cancer-causing chemicals --and Sheldahl was ranked 45. That was picked up by wireservices and published by the Minneapolis Star-Tribune, whichis where the people of Northfield, population 14,000, firstsaw the news.   They were amazed. Sheldahl had been sending methylenechloride into the air for more than 25 years, but no oneoutside the plant knew it. Susan Lloyd, a special educationteacher, tried to figure out what it meant. She called adozen public officials to no avail, but she did glean crucialinformation: The state was about to renew Sheldahl'sfive-year emissions permit, which imposed no controls onmethylene chloride. Citizens could demand a public hearing.She and friends collected 300 signatures on a petitionforcing the state to delay the permit.   Sheldahl hoped to blunt the issue. A week after the newsbroke, the company unveiled a dramatic plan to reducemethylene chloride usage 90% by 1993. Sheldahl wouldgradually switch to flammable solvents that don't causecancer. A spokesman, Mark Ester, says the right-to-knowreport was &quot;a factor, but not the only reason&quot; for proposingthe reduction plan. Beverly Brumbaugh, a vice president, saysit &quot;was not a driving factor at all. We felt for some timethat all emissions needed to be reduced.&quot; He points out thatSheldahl had been working to reduce methylene chlorideemissions since 1988 and had already installed a $1 millionincinerator.   To allay any fears, Sheldahl organized a plant tour forcity officials and residents. Company officials proudlycommitted to reduce annual emissions from 400 tons to 40 tonsin only three years and eliminate them by 2000. They assuredresidents that methylene chloride posed &quot;no significantrisk.&quot;   The plant tour backfired. Jacob Freeze, anartist-turned-activist, was furious. He knew the federalgovernment had identified methylene chloride as a probablecarcinogen in 1985. He accused the company of keeping thepollution a secret and failing to warn the community. RecallsMs. Lloyd, the teacher: &quot;The impression was that Sheldahl wastrying to cover up.&quot;   Sheldahl officials say the company has already spentnearly $5 million to phase out the solvent and can't affordexpensive recovery equipment to stop emissions in theinterim. James Donaghy, president and chief operatingofficer, says Sheldahl is moving &quot;as quickly as we know how&quot;without losing customers. &quot;We are trying to balance all ourconstituencies,&quot; he says.   Residents quickly formed an organization, Clean AirNorthfield, to investigate the health threat. Faculty atCarleton and St. Olaf College provided technical help.   The town became divided. Homemaker Sueanne Johansen pointsto the lush expanse of green grass between Sheldahl and thetrailer park where she lives. &quot;Our children play out there,&quot;she says. &quot;Sheldahl tells us there are `acceptable levels' ofthat stuff. Who are they kidding?&quot; Yet her next-doorneighbor, Patricia Srsen, has complete faith in Sheldahl,where she has worked 17 years as a data clerk. &quot;It's thecollege professors blowing things out of proportion,&quot; shesays. &quot;They think manufacturing is a dirty word.&quot;   Mr. Freeze campaigned for zero emissions by picketing,staging a sit-in and even secretly taking pictures on theplant's roof. His threats to &quot;shut down the plant&quot; alienatedmany of Sheldahl's 650 plant workers, who were alreadyjittery about job security. The workers wanted methylenechloride eliminated, but on a &quot;reasonable&quot; schedule thatwould protect &quot;jobs and money,&quot; says Robin Kruger, a plantsteward for the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile WorkersUnion.   The union also feared that recovering the solvent insidethe plant would increase exposure risks and perpetuate itsuse. After threatening a strike, the union won the right toenforce Sheldahl's 90% use-reduction plan through its laborcontract.   Joining forces, the union and activists pressured thestate for tougher regulation. As a result, for the firsttime, the state required an existing plant to reduce cancerrisks below a strict threshold. Sheldahl, which has alreadyreduced methylene chloride emissions by nearly two-thirds,would have to cut them 93% by 1995 under the state's proposedemissions permit. If citizens hadn't gotten involved throughright-to-know, &quot;there wouldn't be any restrictions in thepermit,&quot; says Lisa Thorvig, the Minnesota Pollution ControlAgency's air compliance chief.   Some Northfield residents aren't satisfied. Clean AirNorthfield is lobbying the state to mandate faster reductionsand zero emissions in 1995. Sheldahl says that just isn'tpossible. Further skirmishes are likely before the finaldecision on the permit later this year.   Whatever the outcome, though, remarkable progress hasalready been made in reducing methylene chloride risks forresidents and workers alike, says Michael Pemrick, a Sheldahlmaintenance worker. He says right-to-know provided thecatalyst. &quot;Once the community got involved,&quot; he says, &quot;therewas tremendous pressure on Sheldahl to work much moreexpediently to reduce the risks.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
