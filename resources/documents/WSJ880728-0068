Poll Flunks U.S. in Geography </HL><SO> </SO><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Most Americans don't know where they're at, according to a Gallup Poll on geographic knowledge. Americans ranked third from last, just before Mexicans and Italians, in a survey of about 10,820 adults requested by the National Geographic Society. Swedes ranked first, followed by West Germans, Canadians, the French and the Japanese; Great Britain tied with the U.S. In a separate rating of adults aged 18 to 24, Americans ranked last.    When participants were asked to find 16 locations -- including Central America, the Pacific Ocean and the Persian Gulf -- on an unmarked map, Swedes located an average 11.6 of the spots while Americans found 8.6.    ilbert Grosvenor, president of the Society, blamed Americans' ignorance on a lack of emphasis in schools. He added, &quot;If we are to be influential in resolving atmospheric and ocean pollution, deforestation, global hunger, nuclear arms control and population balance -- and a whole host of other issues -- we must be geographically literate.&quot;    Americans were particularly bad at locating international hot spots. Half of them thought the Contras and Sandinistas were fighting in Iran, Lebanon, Afghanistan or anywhere else but Nicaragua. Only 55% could identify South Africa as the official home of apartheid. </TEXT></DOC>
