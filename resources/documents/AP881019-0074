(AP ) _ Three environmental groups have called onEnergy Secretary John Herrington to prepare an environmental impactstatement before restarting any of the troubled Savannah RiverPlant reactors.   If the Department of Energy refuses, the groups will seek acourt injunction to stop the three aging reactors from operatinguntil the comprehensive study is completed, Dan Reicher, anattorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said Tuesday.   The NRDC, Greenpeace U.S.A. and South Carolina's Energy ResearchFoundation planned to deliver a letter to Herrington today,requesting the environmental impact statement.   Meanwhile, a published report said Tuesday that poorly trainedpersonnel and inadequate safety procedures were blamed for a leakof 375,000 gallons of water contaminated by radiation at the38-year-old plant.   Officials with the Du Pont Co., which operates the nuclearweapons facility for the Department of Energy, also said anoversight caused underreporting of the amount of radioactivecontaminant in the water released into a creek on July 8, TheAugusta (Ga.) Chronicle and the Augusta Herald reported.   The amount of radiation spilled into the water was too small topose a health or safety threat, officials said.   SRP's three reactors were reduced to half power last year whenexperts questioned whether the emergency cooling system couldhandle a problem at full power.   Since April, all three reactors have been shut down entirely formaintenance and testing amid additional safety questions. Onereactor was restarted for less than a week in August.   When it was shut down, SRP was the government's sole producer ofradioactive tritium and plutonium used in nuclear weapons.   An environmental impact statement is required under federal lawwhenever there is a ``major federal action significantly affectingthe quality of the human environment.''   Reicher said restart of the reactors qualifies as a ``majorfederal action'' because ``revelations about the SRP reactors ...raise disturbing questions about the environmental and safety risksof their future operation.''   Department of Energy Deputy Secretary Joseph Salgado said Oct.10 that a ``phased restart'' of SRP's K Reactor is planned inDecember and restart the two other reactors will be restarted bythe middle of 1989.   Herrington said last week that the department will operatereactors in a safe and ``environmentally sensitive manner'' whilestill meeting the nation's defense needs.</TEXT></DOC>
