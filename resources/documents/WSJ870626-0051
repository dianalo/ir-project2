However, the state insurance commissioner said the action was illegal and ordered Liberty Mutual to rescind the cancellation notices it had sent to Maine employers who had been assigned to it for coverage by the state. Liberty Mutual said its lawyers would have to review the order before commenting.    Maine's workers' compensation system has been criticized by business and insurance groups for years. A 1985 state study concluded it was &quot;probably the most generous in the nation&quot; for injured workers. Maine governors have said the high payments discouraged employees from returning to work and employers from locating in the state.    Liberty Mutual said it has lost $130 million on its workers' compensation business in Maine since 1981, even after consideration of investment income. &quot;We can see no hope for narrowing the huge gap between benefit costs in Maine and workers' compensation rates,&quot; said Gary L. Countryman, Liberty Mutual's president.    Workers' compensation plans, required and regulated by states, cover on-the-job injuries.    Susan Collins, Maine's commissioner of financial regulation, said that despite Liberty Mutual's announcement, the company can't stop insuring companies in the state whose workers' compensation cases are assigned to it by the state insurance commission. Some 85% of workers' compensation is assigned to insurers by the insurance commission because employers can't get insurance otherwise.    &quot;Liberty Mutual's actions show there are some serious problems with workers' compensation in Maine, and that does concern me,&quot; Ms. Collins said. &quot;However, we don't believe Liberty has the authority to cancel (assigned risk) insurance unilaterally.&quot; As a result, employers won't lose workers' compensation coverage, she said.    A Liberty Mutual spokeswoman said the company wasn't prepared to respond to the commissioner's statement. The spokeswoman added that the company is notifying existing policyholders their policies will be canceled in 60 days. She said Liberty isn't writing any new workers' compensation policies in the state but it will continue to handle other lines.    In Maine, &quot;the rate level is set at such an artificially depressed point that the opportunity to break even is virtually nil,&quot; said Chapin Clark, regional vice president of the National Council of Compensation Insurers, an industry funded rating organization. The organization calculates that on average, for every dollar of premium income, Maine insurers will incur $2.94 in benefit-related costs and 18 cents in additional expenses.    State studies have found that Maine's workers' compensation costs per employee are among the highest in the country. Although benefit levels are in line with national averages, critics say it is far easier for workers to qualify for compensation in Maine than elsewhere. Presumably as a result, Maine's lost workday rate has also been among the highest in the country. Moreover, the state requires insurers to pay legal costs for workers seeking compensation, encouraging litigation and increasing costs further.    Maine legislators have been reluctant to allow rate increases because of fears that higher costs will drive employers away. Indeed, in 1985, Nike Inc. cited high labor costs when it closed two footwear plants in Maine, throwing 500 people out of work. At the time, it calculated that the cost of workers' compensation amounted to 95 cents a pair of shoes, up from six cents a pair in 1978. The state hasn't made any significant cuts in the politically popular benefits.    Some Maine politicians viewed the Liberty Mutual announcement as a ploy. House Speaker Joseph Martin said, &quot;basically this is pure blackmail.&quot; Mr. Martin, who has proposed that the state establish its own workers' compensation fund, said he would &quot;serenade Liberty Mutual as they go over the Kittery Bridge,&quot; leaving the state. &quot;Goodbye and good riddance,&quot; he added. </TEXT></DOC>
