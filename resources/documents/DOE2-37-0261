Of these, three were essentially free of dust problems.Respirable dust exposure of workers in the remaining plants dependedon the time spent in the dusty areas. In five of the plants surveyed,Bureau tests showed that in some areas worker exposures could exceedFederal dust limits in less than 2 h. Cooperative studies were arrangedwith coal preparation plants utilizing three different dust control techniques.These included a standard baghouse-type dust collector, two types ofscrubbers, and an electrostatic precipitator. Results showed that appropriateventilation can provide a highly cost effective method for controllingcoal preparation plant dust.</TEXT></DOC>
