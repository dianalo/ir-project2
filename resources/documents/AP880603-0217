Sakharov as translated from Russian intoEnglish by a Soviet Foreign Ministry official.   _On reforms ordered by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev:   The country has entered into the decisive stage of perestroika(restructuring of Soviet economy and society). That's a verycomplicated one and a very contradictory stage of perestroika and Idon't think it would be an exaggeration to say that this is adangerous stage in perestroika.   Perestroika is an historical inevitability because there is noother alternative to the phenomena of stagnation in this country,the lagging behind in terms of scientific and technologicaladvances.   The glasnost (increased openness in certain areas) effort isvery important, but I still have a lot of apprehensions. Importantlaws that have been passed over the past 12 months or so whichpertain to the economy, such laws as those on the state enterpriseand cooperatives, individual labor activity, to my mind still havethe imprint of political compromise, lack of elaboration and haste.   It seems to me the ice has been broken and there is no goingback to Stalinism any more. I think the opponents of perestroikaunderstand that too.   _On the Moscow summit:   The talks which ended between the Soviet and American leaderswere important in the view of promoting Soviet-American relationsand in ensuring a better atmosphere of trust and confidence.   The main thing which is important to everyone is the prospect ofhalving strategic nuclear weapons. I'm sure in talking about the50-percent cuts an agreement is possible without any connection tothe SDI problem. (SDI, the Reagan administration's StrategicDefense Initiative known as the Star Wars program, is a plan for aspace-based anti-missile defense system.)   I subscribe to cutting the military service in the Soviet Unionin all the arms. I suggest that it be halved, corresponding to thereduction in armaments, though probably the number of officersshould not be reduced that drastically. Of course that's aresponsible decision but that step would be very important for theoverall situation internationally and that would help promotedisarmament and detente.   _On Afghanistan:   Now on the Soviet troops withdrawal from Afghanistan. That's amajor historical development. I believe the Soviet troop withdrawalshould go on in any conditions, no matter the actions of the rebelsin Afghanistan.   All the residents of Afghanistan should be given the right toask for political asylum in the Soviet Union and in othercountries, so that they can be sure they will survive.   The introduction of Soviet troops in Afghanistan in 1979 was amajor mistake. One of the results of the democracy effort in theSoviet Union should be a situation where such mistakes will beimpossible to make in the future.   _On human rights:   All the prisoners of conscience (in the Soviet Union) should beset free without any declaration on their part. In 1987 when theywere requested to ask for pardon, it was not a legitimate action. Ithink all those released should be rehabilitated, otherwise whenthese people are considered having been given a pardon thispreserves the situation where they were allegedly tried on alegitmate basis.   Here is another legislative problem. This is the right to freelychoose the country of residence. This should not be reduced to thefamily reunion issue. Full implementation of the right to choosefreely the place of residence, emigration, coming back, ensured bylegislative acts will have vast imporatnce for this society toremain open.</TEXT></DOC>
