Theforgotten provision says that once there's been an officialfinding that Simpson-Mazzoli led to discrimination againstminority workers, Congress can get an expedited vote within30 days to repeal the sanctions against employers for hiringillegals.   In late March, the General Accounting Office foundwidespread discrimination. Thus, the one good chance torepeal sanctions runs up to April 29. And indeed, an unusualalliance of Senators Ted Kennedy and Orrin Hatch hasintroduced a resolution to repeal employer sanctions. Yet fewCongressmen have heard from businesspeople urging a vote torepeal.</LP><TEXT>   Simpson-Mazzoli is the modern era's Prohibition -- amisguided attempt to &quot;control the borders.&quot; The billdeputized all employers as immigration cops by requiring thatthey somehow make sure their employees are in the countrylegally. One problem is that you could gather all thecountry's immigration lawyers into one room and they couldn'treach a conclusion about which noncitizens are allowed towork or how to spot forged documents.   The difficulty employers have complying with the law haseven led to calls for a national identification card, but thefundamental problem remains that the law created perverseincentives. Think of Simpson-Mazzoli as the first legislationsince Jim Crow where the government is so closely alignedwith a process that produces discrimination. The lawencourages what we'd call preventive discrimination.Employers know that overavoidance -- discriminating againstforeign-sounding job applicants -- is the safest way to avoidfines or jail. If all your employees look and speak as iftheir ancestors stepped off the Mayflower, you probably won'tgo to jail.   So it's no surprise that the General Accounting Officefound &quot;widespread discrimination&quot; against job applicantseither because they weren't citizens or because they had a&quot;foreign appearance or accent,&quot; especially Hispanics andAsians. The study, which began the time clock on 30-dayrepeal, estimated that almost 20% of firms discriminate. Itsprovisions led to such absurdities as author Gore Vidal, wholives in Rome, being asked for proof of citizenship before hecould appear as a guest on the Johnny Carson show. Companiesfrom Wendy's to Wal-Mart have been fined for offenses.   The punishments can be severe. Eleven employees of thePiedmont Quilting Corp. of Walhalla, South Carolina, wereindicted last year for immigration violations involvingfaulty records and hiring 85 illegal aliens. The Immigrationand Naturalization Service distributed a press release notingthat the company could be fined $60 million and that ChairmanAlfred Mizhir and 10 others could be sent to jail for 653years each. The INS has never been known for subtlety. Thecompany has paid a half-million-dollar fine. Mr. Mizhirpleaded to 120 counts and is waiting to see if he'll be thefirst employer to be jailed under the new law.   Jail aside, there is something absurd about the idea ofcriminalizing voluntary agreements, such as employment. Thetruth is that &quot;illegal&quot; immigrants fill many jobs throughoutthe economy, from agriculture in the West to food services inthe East. We are now in the midst of a labor shortage, whichCongress seems to want to make worse. The easiest way toensure economic growth, Julian Simon argues in &quot;The EconomicConsequences of Immigration,&quot; is for the U.S. to take in amillion more legal immigrants every year. Removing theemployer sanctions is the first step to a more openimmigration policy.   Why have business groups been so mouselike on repealingsanctions? Probably because no one likes the idea of pleadingguilty to discrimination in order to get a law changed --even if the discrimination is the result of a perverse law.Other groups have urged repeal, though, including the U.S.Civil Rights Commission, the American Bar Association (whichonce supported sanctions) and many Hispanic groups.   Backers of the Kennedy-Hatch resolution say unless there'sa big push in the next several days, this opportunity to fixthe law will slip by. If this happens, expect the INS tobring many more cases against employers in the comfort ofknowing there's little reason to worry. Without thediscipline of a forced quick vote, Congress won't get aroundto reforming the employer sanctions any time soon.</TEXT></DOC>
