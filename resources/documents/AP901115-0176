The Iraqi government says it is holding hundreds of foreignersat strategic locations such as military installations to protectagainst attack. Hundreds also have also been releasedintermittently the past few months, many at the request ofindividual envoys.   Saddam, interviewed in a government guest house in Baghdad, theIraqi capital, said he regrets holding the hostages.   ``This is the only decision which we have taken which ratherchokes us up,'' he said. ``Not for fear of anybody but out of thissense of respect for humanity.''   However, he again asserted that the hostages were his bestprotection against attack.   ``The only justification for this situtation is that thepresence of these people may help distract anybody who may opt forwar. It may make them hesitate a little before jumping into adecision of this nature,'' he said.   On other topics, Saddam was asked why he sought nuclear weapons.``Because Israel is in possession of chemical, biological andnuclear weapons. And Israel is following a policy of expansion atthe expense of the Arabs,'' he replied through an interpreter.   ``So the way we see it is that peace sometimes dictates for akind of balance to be drawn.''   Iraq has made several attempts to acquire equipment andtechnology useful for producing nuclear weapons. In two notableinstances, U.S. and British authorities blocked a shipment offast-acting electrical switches, and U.S. authorities seizedhigh-temperature ovens that authorities said could have been usedfor nuclear devices.   Though many analysts have concluded that Israel either has orcould quickly produce nuclear weapons, Israel has never admittedhaving them and has said Israel will not be the first to introducethem into the Middle east   The Arab fight against Israel also formed the basis of Saddam'sdefenseof sheltering two men accused of many terrorist attacks:Abu Nidal and Abu Abbas.   Though the two may make ``mistakes,'' he said, ``Our view ofthem is different from the way we view the same mistakes made bysomeone whose land has not been occupied ... These are freedomfighters and not highwaymen.''   Bush has been leading the international stand against Iraq'sAug. 2 takeover of neighboring Kuwait. More than 300,000 soldiersfrom 26 nations, including 230,000 from the United States, havemassed in the gulf region. Last week Bush ordered in another200,000 U.S. soldiers.   Asked whether he was willing to discuss the Mideast crisis withother leaders, Saddam said: ``We have been ready all along.''   As for dialogue with the United States, Saddam said he wasunwilling to meet Bush's demand that Iraq unconditionally withdrawfrom Kuwait before any discussions.   ``This is not dialogue. These are preconditions imposed toinsure our capitulation,'' he said. ``We reject suchpreconditions.''   Asked whether his position in Kuwait is negotiable, he said,``When I say something I mean it.'' He did not elaborate.</TEXT></DOC>
