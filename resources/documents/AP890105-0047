The crane was killed near the Aransas National Wildlife Refugewhere it makes its winter home, the first such incident anywheresince 1968, when another hunter was fined for shooting a cranenearby under nearly identical weather conditions, refuge managerBrent Giezentanner said Wednesday.   The investigation will determine whether the hunter, whose namewas not released, shot the crane intentionally or by accident,Giezentanner said.   He said the out-of-town hunter and a companion were hunting forgeese and ducks Tuesday in Spalding Cove, state-owned marshlandsouth of the wildlife refuge, which lies about 45 miles northeast ofCorpus Christ along the Texas coast.   Giezentanner said the shooting may have been accidental, butadded that ``there's still a lot of difference in a 2-foot goose anda 5-foot crane.''   ``A prudent hunter should have known the difference,'' he said.   The 4-year-old female crane was shot as it flew with its matethrough heavy fog above the cove, Giezentanner said, adding that thecrane had brought her first chick with her on the southerlymigration from the Wood Buffalo National Park in northern Canada.   The shooting of cranes is not always detected because theendangered whoopers are not monitored constantly during their annualmigration north or south, he added.   Wildlife refuge officials learned of the shooting after thehunter surrendered, as occurred in the earlier incident.   The hunter involved in the 1968 shooting was fined $500, themaximum penalty then for killing an endangered species under theMigratory Bird Treaty Act.   Under the current Endangered Species Act of 1969, a personcharged with intentionally killing a member of an endangered speciesfaces a one-year sentence and-or a $20,000 fine. An accidentalkilling carries a maximum six-month sentence and-or $10,000 fine.   Authorities said that apart from the 136 adult cranes and chicksthat made the migration to the Aransas refuge this year, only 25others are known to exist in New Mexico, and 40 are kept incaptivity at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service center in Patuxent,Md.   The whooping crane population has steadily increased since thelate 1930s, when fewer than 20 existed.</TEXT></DOC>
