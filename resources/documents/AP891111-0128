The new demand, two days before Shamir begins his trip to theUnited States, is the latest on a list of assurances Israel hassought regarding the planned talks. Israel also wants assurancesthe Palestinian Liberation Organization will be excluded from thenegotiations.   In the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip on Saturday, Israelisoldiers shot and wounded 10 Palestinian protesters, Arab reportssaid. Masked Arabs stabbed and hacked to death a suspectedpro-Israeli collaborator.   Shamir told Israel radio he will try to achieve a ``maximumbenefit'' from a meeting with President Bush in Washington onWednesday. Shamir is also due to meet with Secretary of State JamesA. Baker III during his 11-day trip that begins Monday night.   Last week, Israel gave qualified approval to Baker's plan ofarranging an Israeli-Palestinian meeting in Cairo.   Shamir told the radio that Palestinian delegates ``should be ... people with a technical education, with a certain experience inelections. With them, we shall only determine the ways ofelections.''   Israel also wants assurances from the United States that themeeting will be devoted to election procedures only and isinsisting that only Palestinians from the occupied lands bepermitted to participate.   A peace initiative, adopted by the government in May, calls forelections to choose Palestinian delegates for negotiations withIsrael on an interim period of self-rule in the occupied lands.   In the West Bank town of Hebron, about 2,000 school studentsmarched in the streets, clashing with Israeli troops who respondedwith tear gas and rubber bullets, witnesses said. An Arab reporterfrom Hebron said at least 23 students were detained.   In Qalqilya, about 500 protesters unfurled outlawed Palestinianflags and marched with flowers in their hands to the house of ayouth killed in a clash with soldiers last week. Arab reporterssaid troops wounded one protester, arrested 10 and imposed a curfewon the town.   Nine protesters were wounded in clashes elsewhere in theoccupied lands, Arab reports said. The army confirmed three wounded.   In the Gaza Strip town of Rafah, masked Arabs armed with daggersand axes killed Samir Mohammed Asana, 37, in front of his shoeshop, Arab journalists and Israel radio said.   His death brought to 144 the number of Palestinians killed bytheir brethren on suspicion of assisting the Israeli authorities.At least 613 Palestinians have died of Israeli gunfire in the23-month-old uprising, and 40 Israelis have been killed.   Shamir leaves for New York on Monday night. In addition to hisvisit to Washington, he is scheduled to address Jewish groups inCincinnati and Los Angeles before returning to Israel on Nov. 24.</TEXT></DOC>
