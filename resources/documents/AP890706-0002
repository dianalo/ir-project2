Before and after photographs of the crucifix at Holy TrinityChurch in Ambridge appear virtually the same, said the report by acommission appointed by Bishop Donald Wuerl to study the allegedmiracle.   Thousands of the faithful and the curious visited the white,concrete church about 15 miles northwest of Pittsburgh after hearingreports the eyes, which appeared as small slits, partially closedMarch 24 then returned to normal a few days later.   Although no one reported seeing the lids moving, witnesses saidthey were about one-third open when the plaster crucifix wassuspended 15 feet above the altar in January. During the specialthree-hour prayer meeting, worshipers and the church's pastor, theRev. Vincent Cvitkovic, said they noticed they had closed.   The commission reviewed written reports, interviewed sixwitnesses and looked over other photographs taken by an independentagency the diocese refused to name.   ``Although the witnesses testified to what they had perceived, acareful examination of the photographs provided by Holy TrinityChurch as well as those photographs independently commissioned showsno convincing evidence that a miracle has occurred,'' the reportsaid.   State police trooper Chris Marion, a Holy Trinity parshioner,last month claimed he saw the eyes close briefly again as atelevision crew re-enacted the Good Friday incident.   Marion said the figure opened its eyes after he climbed a ladderunder the crucifix during filming of NBC-TV's ``Unsolved Mysteries''series.   Cvitkovic later said he saw nothing of the second incident andtold church officials nothing happened. The commission did notinvestigate the second incident.   Commission members said they don't doubt the sincerity of thewitnesses interviewed, but believe they could have been fooled bythe church's lighting and the different angles from which theyobserved the crucifix.   The commission is neither encouraging nor discouraging the beliefthe eyes closed, Winter said. ``Our job was to try to verify if amiracle occurred,'' he said. ``We could not.''   Cvitkovic remains on leave for ``four to six weeks of rest,reflection and prayer,'' said the Rev. Paul Maslach of Chicago, whoheads Cvitkovic's order, The Croatian Franciscans.   Cvitkovic is not being punished for talking about the event,Maslach said. The priest was exhausted by the work required whenscores of worshipers began visiting the church to see the crucifix,he said.</TEXT></DOC>
