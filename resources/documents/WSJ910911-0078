On the New York Mercantile Exchange, in thin trading,crude oil for October delivery rose eight cents a barrel tosettle at $21.41. But fuels futures were mixed, with gasolinefractionally higher and heating oil slightly lower.</LP><TEXT>   After futures trading ended, the American PetroleumInstitute released its latest U.S. oil statistics, which areclosely watched by oil traders. The API report showed thatlast week there were big gains of 3.3 million barrels and 3.4million barrels, respectively, in U.S. inventories ofgasoline and distillates, which include heating oil. Whilethese figures are considered bearish for these fuels, the APIreport also showed a sharper than expected drop of 6.9million barrels in crude oil inventories.   Oil analysts generally attributed yesterday's slight pricerises to a technical bounce from the falloff on Monday. Manyanalysts expect oil markets to remain weak, mainly because ofthe growing perception that the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries is likely to overproduce in the fourthquarter.   But several said the overriding reason for the weakness isthe prospect that Iraq's oil may flow into world markets inlarge volumes again soon. &quot;It's Iraqi sales, Iraqi sales andIraqi sales,&quot; said Peter Gignoux, manager of theinternational energy desk in London for Shearson LehmanBrothers.   Iraq still is prohibited from exporting its oil because ofthe United Nations embargo. But the U.N. ban is expected tobe lifted long enough for Iraq to export enough oil to makeemergency purchases of food and medicines. A majoruncertainty, however, is the volume of Iraqi oil the U.N.will allow to be exported. As of late yesterday, thatuncertainty hadn't been resolved.   Adding to the pressures on oil prices, meanwhile, is theapproach of a Sept. 24 Geneva meeting of OPEC's oilministers. It is widely believed that none will be inclinedto reduce output to make any room for either Iraqi or Kuwaitioil. In fact, Saudi Arabia, OPEC's leading producer, isunderstood to be pushing for an increase in OPEC'sproduction, now 23.5 million barrels a day, to hold pricesdown when demand picks up seasonally in the fourth quarter.   The surfacing this week of apparent differences betweenIran and Saudi Arabia over fourth-quarter production levelshas helped to put a floor, at least briefly, under fallingprices. Iran has made clear that contrary to the Saudi view,it wants production held down to boost OPEC's average priceof $19.05 a barrel, to the $21 target.   Some analysts see smoke screens behind the public standsof both Iran and Saudi Arabia. The Saudis may actually wanthigher oil prices because of their pressing revenue needs tomeet their share of the Persian Gulf war costs, some say. And&quot;Iran wants to jack up prices in order to have a higher planeto discount from -- to win market share,&quot; said Norman Higby,a Menlo Park, Calif., energy forecaster.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          LIVESTOCK and MEATS: Pork-belly futures prices fell ascommodity funds and traders took profits from sharp pricerallies the previous two trading days. Strong prices for porkbellies on the cash market supported futures prices in thintrading volume Friday and Monday. Yesterday, however, withmajor traders back in the market following the Jewishholiday, selling was rampant. Weaker prices than expected onthe cash market for hogs exerted downward pressure on hogfutures prices throughout the day, though futures pricesrallied just before the end of trading. The hog contract forOctober delivery settled .02 cents higher, at 45.32 cents apound, while the February pork-belly contract declined .67cents to 49.12 cents a pound.                                                                                                          PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices fell. Gold for Septemberdelivery ended $1.20 an ounce lower at $349.90, while theactively traded December contract lost $1.20 to finish at$354. October platinum ended $2.90 an ounce lower at $348.80.September silver fell 5.9 cents an ounce to $3.982, and theactively traded December contract ended at $4.04, down 6cents. Analysts attributed the decline in gold prices to astatement by the Soviet official in charge of gold marketingpolicy, who warned of uncoordinated and hasty gold sales bythe newly independent republics. Traders took that to meanthe republics are about to dump large quantities of gold onthe market, said George Milling-Stanley, precious metalsanalyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers. Although spot golddipped under $350 yesterday, Mr. Milling-Stanley said heexpects prices to range from $350 to $375 for another monthor two.                                                                                                          COFFEE: Prospects for rain in Brazil this week that couldease effects of a dry spell damped coffee's rally. Coffee forSeptember delivery ended 0.6 cent a pound lower at 89.3cents, while the actively traded December contract fell 1.05cents to 92.5 cents. Forecasts for scattered showers inBrazilian coffee-growing areas persuaded some traders to takeprofits from the recent coffee rally, said Judith Ganes,senior analyst at Merrill Lynch. Before yesterday's decline,spot coffee prices had risen about 4.5 cents a pound sincelate last week, and December coffee had risen more than fivecents. Meteorologist Jim Roemer of Freese Notis Weather inDes Moines, Iowa, said he expects some rain to fall in thenext few days and temporarily relieve the stress on thecoffee crop caused by the recent dry spell. But concernsabout a drought later in the fall and winter persist, headded. Every three to seven years, El Nino, a warm oceancurrent off the Pacific coast of South America, makes anappearance and has been associated with droughts, Mr. Roemersaid. An El Nino appears to be forming now and if itmaterializes, there's better than a 50% chance of a droughtin Brazil this year, he predicted.</TEXT></DOC>
