The courtroom philosophy hangs on a sign: ``A man's got tobelieve in something. I believe I'll have another beer.''   It's cantina justice at the G andamp; G bar, where Gonzalez has beenholding court at the family-owned business since 1966. Defendantsare free to stick around for a cold one.   ``They stick around, they drink beer and all that,'' said the75-year-old JP. ``Sometimes they phone me. They want to come andget married here and I married them here.''   ``They want to give me a tip, but it is not acceptable. Youcannot give any tip to justices. It is against the law, not even agift.''   Near trophies and antlers and an old eight-track tape deck,cowboys drink and listen to Mexican music on a juke box. The aromaof burning mesquite and sizzling meat blows in from the back porch.The G andamp; G offers free barbecue and sells its beer and chips.   Gonzalez calls his son from behind the bar to bring the docketto his bench, an aging chrome dinette set.   ``He's the law west of Highway 281,'' joked County Clerk ArnoldoGonzalez, leaning on the bar. He's a regular at the G andamp; G and anephew of the JP. ``It used to be pretty bad around here, knifings.The last 10 years it has mellowed.''   Constable Bartolo Guajardo says he can't remember the lastmurder in Jim Wells County Precinct 6, in deep south Texas about 50miles from the Gulf of Mexico.   ``People are friendly here because we are all related,'' AgapitoGonzalez said.   The G andamp; G is one of a few buildings at the center of PalitoBlanco, named after the native hackberry trees with bumpy, whitishbark. The town of 300 is surrounded by ranches, farms and miles ofbarbed wire.   Gonzalez deals mostly with speeding tickets, poaching andtenant-landlord disputes. A Texas justice of the peace is a locallyelected court officer. A JP can perform marriages, issue deathcertificates, and, especially in rural areas, issue criminalwarrants and conduct bond hearings.   Gonzalez hears jury trials at the schoolhouse, but that isn'tvery often. His last jury case was two years ago. The JP, known forlight fines and mercy, still worries the jury was too harsh.   ``It was a speeding case, a fellow driving 100 miles an hour,''Gonzalez recalled. ``He lose the case. They charge him a littleover $100, the jury. ... It wasn't fair, because I asked them togive him a break, because he was a young boy, he looked like beinga very nice boy.   ``There is no rich people here in Palito Blanco,'' Gonzalezsaid. ``People here are all very poor. They don't have money. Theywork for their living. Most of them get a little less than $100 aweek and you can't live now with $100 a week.''   Even rich out-of-towners are likely to get off easy, the JPsays. Highway patrolmen, he complains, do not give enough warnings.   Gonzalez, who plans to retire next year, worries about theretirees who get speeding tickets on U.S. 281 on their way southfor the winter.   ``I try to give them a break, because they are old people likeme and sometimes they are not driving as fast as (the officer)said,'' Gonzalez said.   And then there's the story about the Lubbock banker caughtpoaching deer on a nearby ranch.   Gonzalez gave him the minimum fine. Then he talked the gamewardens into tying the deer onto the banker's car.</TEXT></DOC>
