He made his statement in Parliament on behalf of the IsraeliCabinet.   ``The pope spoke about the difficult conflict which is torturingfor all of us and mentioned `another people' in a style reminiscentof past relations with the Church that we considered long gone,''Olmert said.   In a brief speech Sunday, John Paul expressed solidarity withPalestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, who havebeen rebelling against Israeli rule the past 22 months.   ``From the Holy Land come calls for help and solidarity from theinhabitants of the West Bank and from Gaza,'' the pope said. ``Theyare the cries of an entire people which today is particularly tiredand feels weaker after decades of conflict with another peoplelinked to the same land by their history and their faith.''   He added: ``I would like to express to these people my mostprofound solidarity, assuring them that the pope continues to makehis own their legitimate request to live in peace in a country oftheir own, respecting the rights of every other people to enjoy thenecessary security and tranquility.''   The statement did not specifically mention the Jewish people orIsrael, with which the Vatican has no diplomatic relations.   Israel opposes formation of an independent Palestinian state,fearing it would threaten Israel's security. Prime Minister YitzhakShamir's Likud bloc and other right-wing parties view the occupiedterritories as an integral part of Israel.   The PLO's parliament-in-exile from its headquarters in Tunisialast year declared Palestine as an independent state without givingspecific boundaries. Israel refuses to speak to the PLO, which itconsiders a terrorist group.      Shamir's adviser Avi Pazner, reacting to the pope's statement,was quoted Monday by the English-language Jerusalem Post as saying:``The pope's concern for a homeland for the Palestinians is verypeculiar in light of the fact that despite the 40 years of Israel'sexistence, the Vatican has yet to recognize or show the sameconcern for the homeland of the Jewish people.''</TEXT></DOC>
