But the Labor Department's Employment Cost Index and othereconomic reports issued Tuesday brought mixed predictions ofwhether a recession is inevitable or could be averted by slowergrowth in the record seventh year of the economy's expansion.   Economist David Wyss of Data Resources Inc., noting a number ofrecent reports that point to a slowdown in economic expansion, saidhe believed growth had eased enough to convince the Federal ReserveBoard that further credit tightening would not be needed to fightinflation.   Wyss said credit-tightening already done by the Federal Reservemay be enough to postpone a recession for up to two years.   ``It's sort of like death: You can't cure it, you can onlypostpone it,'' Wyss said. ``I don't think we've solved the problemsof the business cycle.''   But chief economist Allen Sinai of Boston Co. Economic AdvisersInc. said he was looking for the next downturn to begin within ayear as inflationary pressures mount.   ``What is happening is that wages and salaries are picking upbecause of the tight labor market. I think there is an increasinglyembedded upward tilt in wage compensation and overall employmentcosts,'' Sinai said. ``There is a recession in there somewhere.''   Others, however, predicted that inflation would ease as theeconomy slows to a sustainable pace and that the Federal Reservethen would ease its tight hold on credit to help the economy into a``soft landing.''   ``I don't think we're headed to a recession,'' said Paine Webbereconomist Maury Harris. ``The Fed's going to be able to head thisthing off at the pass before it gets out of hand.''   In other economic news Tuesday:   _The government reported that orders to U.S. factories for ``bigticket'' durable goods rose a moderate 0.8 percent in March aftertwo months of big declines, reflecting a rebound in orders fortransportation equipment. Excluding that volatile category, orderswere down for the third straight month, declining 2.8 percent.   ``The evidence is mounting that the economy has slowed down,''Data Resources economist Roger Brinner said of that report.   _The National Association of Realtors said sales of existinghomes dropped for the third straight month in March to the slowestpace in more than a year. That news came a week after thegovernment reported the second straight monthly decline of new-homeconstruction. Both declines are blamed on rising mortgage rates.   ``First-time buyers are simply locked out of the market byunaffordable financing,'' said Ira Gribin, president of theRealtors.   _The Labor Department reported that major collective bargainingsettlements reached in private industry in the first quarterprovided for average wage increases of 3.1 percent over the life ofthe contracts. That figure was up from average annual wage gains of2.2 percent in contracts settled in the preceding quarter.   Taken together, analysts said that the four reports containedfew surprises but confirmed that inflation continues to grow as theeconomy slows.   ``If labor costs are rising, and this data shows that they are,price inflation can hardly be less than that, it has to be more,''said Sinai.   Said Wyss: ``I think all the reports are basically good news forthe Fed,'' which has been trying to slow growth to ease inflation.He said the wage gains were higher than the central bank wouldprefer but added, ``It's hard to panic about it.''   The 4.2 percent increase in private-sector wages and salaries inthe year ending March 31 was the highest 12-month jump since a 4.8percent advance reported for the year ending Sept. 30, 1985.   It followed an equally disturbing 4.1 percent rise in wages forthe 12 months ending in December. By comparison, wages had risen3.3 percent for the year ending in March 1988.   Overall private-industry employment costs, which includebenefits paid by employers in addition to wages and salaries, rose4.6 percent over the last 12 months, compared to 3.9 percent in thepreceding year.   ``There is unequivocal evidence of a gradual upward movement inlabor costs,'' said Jerry Jasinowski, executive vice president andchief economist for the National Association of Manufacturers.   The Employment Cost Index is closely watched because it gives abroad view of possible inflationary pressures on business costs.   For the first quarter, overall compensation costs in privateindustry rose 1.3 percent, up from 1.0 percent in the final quarterof 1988 but down from the 1.5 percent increase in the first quartera year ago, when a 5 percent rise in Social Security taxes boostedbenefit costs.   Workers in the fast-growing service-producing industriesreceived average wage and salary increases of 5.1 percent over thelast 12 months, compared to average 3.1 percent pay gains byworkers in goods-producing jobs, the Labor Department said.   The rate of wage gains for non-union workers continued tooutpace pay increases for union workers, although wages for unionworkers remain higher.</TEXT></DOC>
