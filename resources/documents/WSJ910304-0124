While such alliances are onthe rise, cultures and personalities sometimes clash.Entrepreneurs sometimes feel neglected. And if the bigpartner's priorities shift, the small company sometimes isset adrift.                                                                                                          Wadley-Phillips                                                                                                          In 1986, a flush Phillips Petroleum Co., based in Tulsa,Okla., agreed to provide $4.5 million over three years tofund a joint venture with Wadley Biosciences, the for-profitarm of Wadley Institute, Dallas. Phillips wanted to get intogenetic engineering and had a fermentation process thatWadley might use.   But when oil prices soon plunged, Phillips jettisoned somenon-oil operations and ruled out further funding for thejoint venture. &quot;It was strictly an economic decision,&quot; saysArthur P. Bollon, president of Wadley Biosciences. A Phillipsofficial says he doesn't dispute that.   Fortunately, Mr. Bollon was already working on a survivalstrategy for just such an occasion. Unlike the leaders ofmost research start-ups, he was actively seeking to licenseready-to-market products that would create enough revenue tofund research and attract future investors with profit ratherthan promise. The first such product, scheduled to beintroduced this summer, is a system to prevent thecontamination of urine specimens during transport andstorage.   Now, Mr. Bollon is again approaching big companies to helpmarket the product. This time, though, he is pittingcompanies with similar products against one another in orderto obtain a high minimum-royalty and an option to pull out ifsales fall short. That, he says, will ensure aggressivemarketing by the eventual partner.   Mr. Bollon says the company is stable enough to continueoperating until the financing is complete. &quot;But we can't setup our marketing and sales operation until we get the nextround,&quot; he says.                                                                                                          Celestial Seasonings-Kraft                                                                                                          When it was sold in 1984 to the company then known as Dartandamp; Kraft Inc., Celestial Seasonings was a successfulcounterculture company known for its hang-loose style andquaintly named teas. But the company, whose initial fundingconsisted of $800 from the sale of a Volkswagen, wasconstantly borrowing to finance operations and couldn't keepup with demand.   Dart andamp; Kraft had formed a venture division to acquireboutique brands with the potential to reach $100 million insales. Celestial Seasonings' new parent provided marketingresearch and advertising, and could afford to finance growthof the brand, says Barnet Feinblum, the tea company's currentpresident. Celestial Seasonings soon doubled its share of theherbal-tea market to 54%, storming ahead of Unilever's ThomasJ. Lipton Inc. unit.   But trouble was brewing. Dart andamp; Kraft tagged new productswith such pedestrian names as &quot;Celestial Seasonings Herb andamp;Spice Cooking Blend,&quot; which didn't suit the maker of RedZinger, Raspberry Patch and Grandma's Tummy Mint. The giantcompany was also slow in making decisions, taking weeks toapprove the purchase of a tea-bag machine for a new line ofblack teas, Mr. Feinblum recalls. By then, TV ads wereappearing in some markets for products that weren'tavailable.   Soon, Dart andamp; Kraft was unloading its nonfood businesses,changing its name back to Kraft Inc. and girding for atakeover by Philip Morris Cos. As part of its restructuring,Kraft disbanded its venture division and shifted CelestialSeasonings into the grocery division. There, pressure mountedto increase profits and abandon new-product development.   Eventually, after Kraft moved to sell the tea maker toLipton, Celestial Seasonings' executives bought back thecompany themselves in November 1988, in a $60 millionleveraged buy-out. Now its revenue is running 15% ahead ofthe executives' original projections. The company haslaunched a raft of new products, including iced teas,caffeine-free black teas and family-sized tea bags.   Kraft officials didn't respond to repeated requests forinterviews for this story. As for Celestial Seasonings'officials, they are philosophical about the Kraft experience.Mr. Feinblum says, &quot;It was a good relationship, but a badmarriage.&quot;                                                                                                          Total Solutions-Pioneer                                                                                                          In 1984, Total Solutions, which sold accounting-softwarepackages for the construction business, was acquired byPioneer Hi-Bred International Inc.'s TLS subsidiary for $2.2million.   Total Solutions, based in Louisville, Colo., needed deeperpockets to upgrade its programs and expand its sales force.Pioneer Hi-Bred, a farm-genetics company based in CedarRapids, Iowa, was diversifying to cope with the agriculturalslump of the mid-1980s.   But Total Solutions' sales failed to meet Pioneer's goals,says founder James Howell. By July 1985, Pioneer fired dozensof Total Solutions employees and moved Mr. Howell and his topmanagers to Cedar Rapids. The two cultures clashedimmediately, and the relationship between TLS and TotalSolutions quickly soured. By early 1986, Pioneer omittedpayments under the original purchase agreement with Mr.Howell and stripped him of responsibilities, leaving him toplay video games. As Mr. Howell recalls, &quot;there was a fairamount of screaming going on.&quot;   Mr. Howell sued Pioneer for breach of contract and the twosettled out of court. Mr. Howell agreed to take $450,000 forTotal Solutions, instead of the original $2.2 million, signeda non-compete clause and returned to Colorado to be aconsultant.   In May 1986, Pioneer asked Mr. Howell to buy the TotalSolutions software back. Instead, Mr. Howell persuaded one ofhis clients to license the product from Pioneer. Mr. Howellbecame marketing manager for the client's new company,Atlantic Software, which had $700,000 in sales in 1987.   Pioneer tried again to sell the package to Mr. Howell in1988. But when that failed, Pioneer sued, alleging that Mr.Howell and Atlantic had violated the non-compete pact, andterminated the license. Atlantic quickly wrote its ownupdated version of the original software, an act that Pioneeralleges violates federal copyright law.   The mushrooming dispute took a toll on Atlantic. In 1988,Pioneer defaulted on a $50,000 payment due Mr. Howell, andhis lenders forced the sale of some Atlantic assets.Desperate, Atlantic renewed negotiations to buy back theoriginal software. That failing, Atlantic sued Pioneer inCedar Rapids federal court for canceling the license, forallegedly slandering Mr. Howell and Atlantic, and for allegedbusiness interference. Pioneer says it is only trying toprotect its copyright.   Crippled by legal fees, Atlantic has cut its staff andclosed sales offices. Mr. Howell recently resigned fromAtlantic to try to separate the company from what he calls a&quot;crazy&quot; personal battle between himself and Pioneer. Still,he maintains, selling to a bigger company &quot;is a logical wayto grow if you pick the right people.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
