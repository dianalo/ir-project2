(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Data General is betting the farm on its new AViiON models 7000 and 8000 UNIXservers.andP;  But can the company convince customers to gamble on it?andM;The muscle of Data General Corp.'s new AViiON servers lies on a singleprocessor board.andP;  The UNIX-based AViiON models 7000 and 8000, introduced inNew York City on March 13, feature a four-processor board rated at 117million instructions per second, putting them at the top of the AViiON line.andM;Data General hopes the new servers will catch the eye of customers looking tomove mainframe applications to UNIX servers, as well as prop up theWestborough, Mass.-based company's sagging revenues.andP;  But, despite thesystems' technical caliber, analysts question whether the company has thesales and marketing clout to pull that off.andP;  Both machines feature aprocessor board built around four Motorola 88100 reduced instruction setcomputing  (RISC) processor chips, each running at 25 megahertz.andP;  The boardcan also be installed in older AViiON 5000 and 6000 systems.andM;The AViiON 7000 is a deskside server that can accommodate up to 512 megabytesof internal memory and up to 3.3 gigabytes of internal disk storage.andP;  Up to11GB of external disk storage and up to 1,024 terminals can be connected tothe system.andP;  The 7000 can also support up to two local area networks.andP;  Thesystem is priced from $162,950.andM;The more expandable AViiON 8000 is a rack mount system that can be increasedto 768MB of internal memory.andP;  It can be configured with up to 48GB ofexternal storage and can support up to eight LANS and 1,275 terminals.andO;Prices start at $249,520.andP;  Also available with the new systems is a newoperating system.andP;  Data General's DG/UX 5.4, a version Of ATandamp;T'S UNIX SystemV, release 4, supports symmetric multiprocessing and disk mirroring.andM;An All Purpose ServerandM;Paul Marcucci, product manager for high-end AViiON systems at Data General,says the company felt it needed the quad-processor systems to compete withother UNIX system vendors.andP;  &quot;We offer better performance at a lower pricethan IBM, HewlettPackard and other manufacturers.andP;  Although our systems arenot intended to compete against specialized servers, like an Auspex system,they offer is users a fast general purpose system that can be used in a mixedenvironment.&quot;andM;Although Data General's AViiON line is not as broad as Hewlett-Packard Co.'sUNIX offerings, analysts !say the company now has all edge in raw power.andP;  Youwould expect that from Data General,&quot; say's Carolyn Griffin, an analyst withinternational Data Corp., a market research firm based in Framingham, Mass.andO;&quot;But the real challenge for the company will be getting tile systems out ofthe door.&quot;andM;Griffin says a sales force used to selling smaller systems and a slow economymay hamper the company's sales efforts.andP;  She also notes that, while DataGeneral has been known for its technical ability, sales and marketing havenot been the company's forte in the past.andP;  A feature that may help DataGeneral win is sales is a new disk array also announced with the high-endAViiON systems.andP;  The High Availability Disk Array subsystem, available forthe 8000 system, as well as the 6200 models, offers up to 30(;B of storage ina redundant array of inexpensive disks  RAID) Level 5 configuration.andM;The company says the drive subsystems offer an alternative to  diskmirroring, which effectively halves the amount of storage available to users.andO;Instead, the new system uses one hard disk out of each array of five disks asa parity-checking disk, ensuring the reliability of the data stored on theother four.andM;One advantage of the parity-checking configuration, says Data General, isthat each array contains a spare disk that will be put into action in theevent of a disk failure.andP;  Disks can be replaced with the power on.andP;  The diskarray also compares favorably with competitive offerings.andP;  Its list price ismore than 50% less per megabyte than RS/6000 storage systems from IBM.andM;All of the new products and features are an attempt by Data General to beefup the ANiiON line to carry the weight of the company's future, says IDC'sGriffin.andP;  According to IDC, sales of AViiON systems amounted to more than$100 million last year, about 20% of Data General's total product revenue.andO;The proprietary ECLIPSE MV series pitched in close to 75% of Data General'ssales, but company officials are hinting at a diminished role for the m v andare leaning toward a growing dependence on open systems through AViiON sales.andO;&quot;Eventually, Data General will have to get away from proprietary systems, butI don't expect that will happen until the mid1990s,&quot; says Griffin.andP;  &quot;In themeantime, these systems add  breadth to the AViiON line where it was neededmost-at the top.&quot;andM;IN FOCUSandM;Data General Corp.andM;Westborough, Mass.andM;Price: $162,950andM;Circle No.andP;
