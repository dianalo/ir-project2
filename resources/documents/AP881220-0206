In December,1987, President Reagan and Gorbachev signed the Intermediate-rangeNuclear Forces treaty which provides for eliminating all U.S. andSoviet land-based missiles with ranges of 300 miles to 3,400 miles.   The Bush administration also will closely monitor the moves ofthe 12-nation European Economic Community, or Common Market, to forma single market by the end of 1992. That's when the nations are toremove many of the trade barriers separating them.   U.S. officials worry _ despite repeated denials by Europeans _that the unifying moves will cause Western Europe to turn inward,possibly erecting barriers to goods from the United States.</TEXT><HEAD>CHINA</HEAD><BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE><DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   China and the Soviet Union are expected to holdtheir first summit in 30 years by mid-1989, ending a rift thatdrastically reshaped the strategic thinking of the world powers.   The Reagan administration stressed it welcomed the easing oftensions between the two giants and expressed faith in Chineseassertions they will never return to the relationship of the 1950swhen Beijing was a subservient ally of Moscow.   But George Bush, a former U.S. ambassador to China, will need totake a new look at how China figures in American strategic interestswhen Mikhail S. Gorbachev's meeting with Deng Xiaoping formallymakes America's ``China card'' obsolete.   U.S.-Chinese relations based on shared antipathy to Sovietpolicies have long been overshadowed by more substantially bindingties. Total trade for 1988 is expected to reach $12 billion andcontinues to grow. U.S. businesses have invested $3 billion inChina's modernization drive. Scientific, military and culturalexchanges are everyday occurrences, and thousands of Chinese studyat American universities and research centers.   The Bush administration must decide how far to push China to playa larger role in ending the war in Cambodia. China provides arms andpolitical support to the Khmer Rouge, the strongest faction in theanti-Vietnamese coalition in Cambodia. Vietnam insists thewithdrawal of its troops hinges on assurances the Khmer Rouge,blamed for the deaths of 1 million Cambodians when they ruled in the1970s, not return to power.   The end of the Iran-Iraq War in the Middle East easedU.S.-Chinese tensions over Chinese arms sales to Iran. However,China's drive to sell arms in the Third World, including countriesopposed to U.S. interests, could again become an issue in 1989.</TEXT><HEAD>CENTRAL AMERICA</HEAD><BYLINE>By BRYNA BRENNAN</BYLINE><DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Marked by wars, deep economic problemsand social and political instability, Central America poses newforeign policy questions for the Bush administration in 1989.   The president will have to decide if he will continue the Reaganadministration's funding for the Contra rebels in their attempt tooust the almost 10-year-old leftist Sandinista government inNicaragua. Bush, shortly after his election, indicated he might takea more diplomatic approach with the Sandinistas.   The majority of the Contras, backed by the United States since1981, moved into base camps in Honduras in 1988 to receiveU.S.-supplied goods ranging from food to uniforms. Honduras, astrong U.S. ally, wants the United States to get the rebels out.   In El Salvador, Marxist-led guerrillas appear more determinedthan ever to topple the U.S.-backed government. More than $3 billionin aid over almost a decade failed to end the war or right theeconomy. Presidential elections in March favor the conservativecandidate from the National Republican Alliance, known as Arena.   The Salvadoran conservatives promised a tougher approach towardthe guerrillas, battling since 1979.   Honduras and Panama will hold presidential elections in 1989.Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the Panamanian strongman, could run andwin, putting the Bush administration in the position of dealing withan elected leader who has been indicted on drug charges in theUnited States.   In Guatemala, a civil war with Marxist guerrillas simmers. Thedemocratically elected government will face continued pressures fromthe ultra-conservative sector not to go soft on communism.</TEXT><HEAD>SOUTH AMERICA</HEAD><BYLINE>By KEVIN NOBLET</BYLINE><DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   South America's crushing foreign debt anda firmly entrenched cocaine industry will pose tough challenges forthe new U.S. administration in 1989 and years go come.   The foreign liabilities of South American nations surpass $250billion and show no signs of shrinking. Several of the biggestdebtor countries, including Brazil, Argentina and Peru, spent 1988struggling with stagnant economies, soaring inflation and spreadingsocial turmoil.   Shackled by huge debt obligations, their governments are lookingnorth for reduced interest rates and other forms of financialrelief. It would be proof, they contend, that the United States andother wealthy countries are sincere in their pledge to back thecontinent's young and increasingly troubled democracies.   Few South Americans expect any radical change in U.S. policy whenGeorge Bush takes office, however. His secretary of state, formerTreasury chief James Baker, proposed three years ago a program ofnew credits that debtor countries said did not go far enough.   The billion-dollar cocaine business also is seen as endangeringthe stability of some South American countries, including Colombia,Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia. Despite the arrest of some kingpins andseizures of tons of drugs, traffickers have remained largely immuneto law enforcement efforts by bribing, intimidating and even killingpublic officials.   During his campaign, Bush vowed an all-out war on narcoticstraffickers, saying he was willing to send U.S. troops into foreigncountries that wanted help battling drug production.</TEXT><HEAD>CARIBBEAN</HEAD><BYLINE>By ROBERT GLASS</BYLINE><DATELINE>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Among Caribbean nations, Haiti posesone of the most difficult problems the Bush administration is likelyto deal with.   U.S. officials say they are encouraged by democratic reformsundertaken by Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril since he assumed Haiti'spresidency in a military coup Sept. 17.   He has installed a mostly civilian Cabinet, purged the army ofscores of notoriously corrupt officers and stepped up cooperationwith the United States in reducing drug-trafficking through Haiti.   At stake is $70 million in direct U.S. economic aid suspended byCongress after abortive presidential elections in November 1987 inwhich paramilitary thugs massacred at least 34 people at pollingstations.   Bush must decide whether to recommend a resumption of aid inhopes of keeping Avril in power long enough to make good on hispromise of democracy, or to await further reforms.   Elsewhere in the Caribbean, the United States will be watchingfor signs of a shift in Cuban-Soviet relations in view of FidelCastro's lack of enthusiasm for Mikhail S. Gorbachev's call for moreopenness and economic enterprise.   Bush can expect continued improvement in relations with Guyana,as President Desmond Hoyte seeks Western aid in dealing with thenon-aligned nation's grave economic plight. A U.S. military aid teamis to begin work in Guyana this spring.   In Jamaica, Prime Minister Edward Seaga, who is staunchlypro-United States, faces a tough challenge from former PrimeMinister Michael Manley, a socialist, in elections expected earlythis year.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
