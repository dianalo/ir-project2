(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The radio-commanded firing of anonboard motor Monday shifted a new navigation satellite into acircular orbit about 11,000 miles above the Earth, the Air Forcereported.   The Navstar satellite was launched here Saturday into apreliminary ellitical orbit ranging from about 100 to 11,000 mileshigh.   The new satellite is the second advanced model Navstar to belaunched. It is designed to tell U.S. and allied military forceswhere they are within 50 feet anywhere in the world _ on land, seaor in the air, and in any weather.   Ground stations tracked the satellite for nearly two days toaccurately determine its orbital path, then sent a radio signal at3:12 p.m. Monday to start the motor. On the new path, thesatellite's high and low points are both at about 11,000 miles.   ``The burn was succesful and everything looks good,'' said Lt.Johnn Kennedy, a spokesman for the Air Force Space Division in LosAngeles.   Officials said ground controllers would check out the payload'ssystems for between 35 and 40 days before placing it on operationalpatrol, joining eight other Navstar satellites already in orbit.</TEXT></DOC>
