More than 24,000 people were evacuated as a result of 351 railaccidents involving toxic materials in 1987, according to CitizenAction, a public interest group based in Washington with chapters in25 states.   Forty-one of 50 states had at least one accident, the group said,basing its findings on figures supplied by the Federal RailroadAdministration.   A spokeswoman for the federal agency defended enforcementefforts, saying that more hazardous material is being transported byrail and yet figures on rail cars leaking such material show adecline from 1984 and 1985.   In 1987, the private group said, Illinois led the nation with 49rail accidents involving hazardous materials, followed by Texas with46 and Louisiana and Michigan with 15 each.   Texas had the greatest number of railcars leaking toxicmaterials, _ 29, or nearly one-third of the total _ in what thegroup considered the most accurate measure of accident severity.   Pennsylvania led the country with 12,360 people evacuated.   Although the number of toxic rail accidents nationwide declined3.7 percent from 1986, Citizen Action said the severity of thoseaccidents ``increased significantly,'' with the number of railroadcars leaking toxic substances up 12.7 percent, from 79 in 1986 to 89in 1987.   Those numbers, however, are down from 109 railcars that releasedhazardous materials in 1985 and 100 in 1984, said the FederalRailroad Administration.   Most toxic rail accidents were concentrated in heavily populatedstates bordering the Great Lakes and the Gulf Coast _ states withheavy industry or oil and gas production, Citizen Action said.   ``Few communities are safe from the environmental contaminationof these catastrophes on wheels,'' said Robert Creamer, spokesmanfor Citizen Action and executive director of the Illinois PublicAction Council, which conducted the study.   Citizen Action said 4 billion tons of hazardous materials areshipped annually, involving 250,000 shipments and 3,000 carloads aday.   The group contended that although 53 percent of rail accidentsinvolving hazardous materials stemmed from mechanical failures, theFederal Railroad Administration does not effectively enforce railsafety standards.   ``The greatest contributor to toxic rail accidents are unsafetrack and roadbeds, yet even when FRA inspectors find a defect, theydo not assess a penalty _ they only notify the railroad of itsnon-compliance,'' Creamer said.   A spokeswoman for the agency said notifications come only in veryminor cases, and she said the agency in 1987 assessed hazardousmaterials penalities totaling $646,750.</TEXT></DOC>
