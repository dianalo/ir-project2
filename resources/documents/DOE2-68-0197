Thefirst type of cogeneration includes the very large facilities which sellthe majority of their electrical output to an electric utility. The secondtype of cogeneration facility is one which is located at a large industrialfacility where the total cogeneration plant output--both electrical andthermal--is consumed totally by the local industrial processes. Theremay be some small selloff of electricity to the local utility as a load-balancingtechnique but, in general, the facility is built to provide only theenergy needs of that specific site. This type of development is stillvery detailed and complex but the need for careful negotiations withan electric utility is not required in this case which simplifies thingsconsiderably. The third type of cogeneration plant consists of thosewhich may be located in commercial applications such as large hotels,airports, hospitals, and universities. Again, these plants are typicallydesigned so that all of the output is consumed locally although in somecases there has been some selloff of electricity to the local electricutility.</TEXT></DOC>
