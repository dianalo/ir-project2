(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The doctor for three AIDS-exposed brotherswho were ostracized in their hometown has retracted his diagnosisof AIDS-related complex for the oldest boy.   Jerry Barbosa testified at a hearing Tuesday that he earliermade the diagnosis for 11-year-old Ricky Ray because he feltcompelled to under a judge's order.   AIDS-related complex, or ARC, often is a precursor to acquiredimmune deficiency syndrome. There is no known cure for AIDS.   ``The way I interpreted the order, I had no choice but to labelthis patient as having ARC against my clinical judgment,'' Barbosatold U.S. Magistrate Elizabeth A. Jenkins.   The purpose of Tuesday's hearing was to clarify earlier reportsthat the physician had diagnosed ARC in the youth weeks beforereporting it to the court.   On Jan. 29, U.S. District Judge Elizabeth Kovachevich modifiedan earlier order and required Barbosa to report the progress of``any AIDS, AIDS symptomology, or other AIDS-related syndrome.''   Her wording prompted him to say in his Feb. 2 report that Rickyhad developed ARC, Barbosa said.   But Ricky has not exhibited physical symptoms necessary for sucha finding, although the boy's blood tests might support an ARCdiagnosis, the doctor said. He also cited April 1987 guidelinesissued by the federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta thatprohibit labeling any child under age 13 as having ARC.   ``It doesn't mean much to the court that somebody has or doesn'thave ARC,'' Ms. Jenkins said. ``When material changes in the boys'health occurs, it is not up to the court to try to look behind themedical reports to see what is there.''   When Ms. Kovachevich ruled Aug. 5, 1987, that the DeSoto CountySchool system had to readmit the Ray brothers to regular classes,she ordered AIDS testing of the boys every six months and said anychanges in their condition had to be reported to her.   Ms. Jenkins told attorneys for the Rays and the school board todevise an improved way to keep the court informed about thehemophiliac brothers' medical conditions. The attorneys must submitthe plan by Monday.   Ricky, Robert, 10, and Randy, 8, were banned from regularclasses after they tested positive for the AIDS antibody in August1986. Doctors say the children were apparently exposed to the AIDSvirus through infusions of blood products that aim to promoteclotting.   Soon after the boys began school in Arcadia last fall, amid aboycott and protests by other students' parents, an arsonisttorched the Ray home. Since then, the family has moved to Sarasota,where the Ray children have attended public school without incident.</TEXT></DOC>
