This mayseem like a truism, but in fact it is always difficult to convince oneselfthat something as easy as talking and listening demands computationalpower. Just like seeing, using language seems effortless. In fact, atremendous amount of knowledge goes into natural language processing,be it by people or machines. Current natural language (NL) systems containthousands of rules to store all this knowledge. The first job in thischapter will be to understand what this knowledge looks like and whythere has to be so much of it. Following this overview of current NLsystem, the second topic on the agenda is to show that that's the problemwith many current NL systems: that they contain thousands of rules. Suchsystems can be engineering nightmares, difficult to debug, maintain,or extend. To remedy this, the authors discuss current work at MIT thataims to eliminate these massive rule systems. As we shall see, thesenew proposals give us NL systems that are modular, more easily adaptedto future parallel-processing computer architectures, and more easilyextendable to other dialects and languages.</TEXT></DOC>
