Weakness in the British pound triggered the increase, the firstsince November.   The Bank of England signaled the rise in British commercialbanks' base lending rate by announcing it was raising its own moneymarket rate to 14 percent, effective today.   Britain's four major commercial banks, Barclays Bank PLC,Midland Bank PLC, National Westminster Bank PLC and LLoyds BankPLC, responded by raising their base rate one point to that level.   After its announcement, the Bank of England underlined itssupport for the pound by intervening against the dollar, foreignexchange dealers said.   Both moves helped lift sterling about one cent against thedollar but the pound quickly fell back from highs reachedimmediately after the rate announcement.   The pound stood at $1.5665 at late morning in London, down froma high of $1.5750 after the rate increase, but up from $1.5645 inNew York late Tuesday.   Stock prices fell sharply on London's Stock Exchange. TheFinancial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index fell 26.2 points, or1.2 percent, to 2,125.4, by late morning.   The government was ``obviously reacting because it is concernedabout the fall in the pound,'' said Tim Fox, an economist atMidland Bank.   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, speaking at the ConservativeParty's Women's National Conference, repeated that high interestrates were necessary to bring down inflation, which is running atan annual rate of 8 percent, compared with 3.9 percent a year ago.   She said that while the effects of high interest rates might beuncomfortable, continued high inflation would be worse.   A Treasury official, who wasn't identified in accordance withBritish practice, said the government ``has always made it clearthat we will take no risks with inflation.''   He said that while consumer demand is slowing, the governmentcouldn't ignore the fall in the currency.   Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, the Treasury's topofficial, has repeatedly stated over the past few months that thegovernment was prepared to defend sterling because a decline in thecurrency would increase inflationary pressures.   The 8 percent annual inflation rate for April raisedexpectations that inflation would climb higher, rather than peak atthat level, as Lawson had forecast in March. Some analysts havesaid that the government might raise interest rates as far as 15percent before they come back down again.   The interest rate rise might not be passed on to mortgageholders this time. Officials from building societies, which are themajor lenders of mortgage money in Britain, have indicated recentlythat they might hold off on increasing mortgage rates, especiallyif they view a base rate rise as a short-term measure.   Mortgage rates were last increased in January to between 13.5percent and 14.2 percent.   Building societies, flush with funds, aren't keen to suppressthe mortgage market, which has already been depressed by previousrate rises.   The last time interest rates stood at 14 percent was in March1985. The interest rate increase was the 10th since June, when thebase rate stood at 7.5 percent, a decade low.   The commercial banks' corporate customers can obtain loans atone percentage point above the base rate.</TEXT></DOC>
