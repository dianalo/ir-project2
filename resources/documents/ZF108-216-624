(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>With the introduction of the 68040 and the 486, the capabilities of the twoleading CISC architectures have largely converged.andP;  Both have 8Kbytes ofon-chip cache, both have on-chip MMUs, and both have highly optimizedpipelines.andP;  Motorola's design is more sophisticated, particularly in thecache, bus interface, and floating-point unit, but their chip is also aboutnine months behind Intel's.andM;Along the way to the 486 and the 040, however, each company followed asignificantly different path, and it is instructive to see how eacharchitecture arrived at its current implementation.andP;  Ironically, whileMotorola has had superior chips at almost every step, Intel has ended up witha larger market, due primarily to the incredible success of the IBM PC andits compatibles.andP;  The fact that Motorola lost the IBM design has had analmost incalculable impact on the fate of each company.andP;  Had IBM based the PCon the 68000, the 8086 would have had minor place in computing history.andM;Family RootsandM;While the 8086 and the 68000 are both considered to be 16-bitmicroprocessors, the 68000 is really a 16-bit implementation of a 32-bitarchitecture.andP;  Motorola's management chose not to hobble the architects byinsisting on compatibility with the previous generation, and the original68000 design was remarkably clean.andM;The 8086, on the other hand, bears more than a passing similarity to the8080.andP;  While not binary-compatible with the 8080, the 8086 has a strictsuperset of the 8080's registers, and it is trivial to translate 8080assembly language to 8086 assembly language.andP;  Rather than making the jump to32-bit registers, as did Motorola, Intel decided to stick with 8- and 16-bitregisters.andP;  Ib increase the address space beyond the 64 Kbytes provided bythe 16-bit addresses of the 8080, Intel's designers chose a segmentedaddressing scheme.andP;  In this scheme, 16-bit segment registers are logicallyshifted four bit positions to the left and are added to 16-bit addressoffsets to produce 20-bit addresses.andM;In retrospect, this was a terrible design choice.andP;  The lack of a &quot;flat&quot;(linear) address space caused untold grief for programmers and introducedawkward kludges into compilers.andP;  In addition to the awkward 64-Kbytesegments, the 8086 architecture is limited to a 1-Mbyte total addressingrange.andM;Motorola's 68000, on the other hand, provided a 32-bit linear address space,and even in its first implementation, 24 physical address bits wereavailable.andP;  As a result, any programmer that didn't have a vested interest inthe Intel architecture preferred the Motorola design.andP;  The 68000 dominatedapplications such as laser printer controllers and Unix workstations, inwhich a large, flat address space was valuable.andM;Why were Intel's designers so short-sighted? Because they designed the 8086in great hurry, and did not intend it to be the basis of an architecture thatwould dominate computing into the 1990s.andP;  In the late 1970s, Intel's effortswere focused on the grand iAPX 432 project.andP;  The 432 was Intel's shot at afresh start, a radical new architecture with no ties to the old 8080 design.andO;With the 432 effort well underway, Intel's management became concerned thattheir competitors would have 16-bit microprocessors on the market well beforethe 432 would be ready.andM;As a result, Intel launched a crash project to extend the 8080 to create astop-gap 16-bit product.andP;  Rumor has it that the 8086 architecture wasdesigned by three men in a hotel room in a period of two weeks.andP;  Needless tosay, this 'stop-gap' product turned into the foundation of the company.andP;  The432 was an utter failure, due to its poor performance, questionable designtradeoffs, and the conceptual barriers designers faced in understanding thenew architecture.andM;Despite the clear technical superiority of the 68000, Intel had one keyadvantage - time.andP;  Intel was about a year ahead of Motorola in volumeshipments of their 16-bit processor.andP;  Intel was even further ahead inshipping a version with an 8-bit bus - the 8088, which IBM chose for itsfirst PC.andM;The All-Important Design WinsandM;Intel began losing more and more designs to the 68000, and in response, thecompany started  Operation Crush.' This was an all-out sales and marketingpromotion for the 8086 family, with a goal of getting 2000 design wins by theend of 1980.andP;  Stuck with an inferior architecture, Intel promoted other areaswhere the company had an advantage - peripheral chips, development tools, andapplication support.andM;The Intel strategy was summed up with surprising honesty by William Davidowin his book Marketing High Technology.andP;  In talking about the Operation Crushtask force, Davidow, who was Intel's VP of Marketing at the time, says:andM;'Everyone on the task force accepted the harsh truth that Motorola and Ziloghad better devices.andP;  If Intel tried to fight the battle only by claiming ourmicroprocessor was better than theirs, we were going to lose.andP;  But we alsoknew that a microprocessor designer needed more than just the processor, andwe had our competitors beaten hands down when it came to the extras.'andM;Operation Crush was successful in saving the 8086 from oblivion.andP;  But one keycustomer was responsible for making the 8086 architecture dominate desktopcomputers in the 1980s: IBM.andP;  Because of the popularity of IBM's personalcomputers, and the fact that other computer manufacturers could make machinesthat could run the same software, the 8086 architecture turned into a smashhit.andM;Meanwhile, at about the same time, a design team at Apple was selecting themicroprocessor for Lisa, the forerunner of the Macintosh.andP;  The originaldesign called for a bit-slice implementation, but early in the developmentprocess the  designers changed to the 68000.andP;  Apple has long been the largestcustomer for the 68000 family.andP;  Because of Apple's high prices and stubbornrefusal to license their system software, the Macintosh has grown much moreslowly than IBM and IBM-compatible PCs, and Motorola has sufferedcorrespondingly.andM;Intel's Blundering EvolutionandM;Intel followed the 8086 with the 80186 and the 80286.andP;  The 186 was designedto reduce system chip count with on-chip timers, DMA, and interruptcontroller, while the 286 provided higher performance and a memory managementunit.andP;  Intel made major blunders in the design of both the 186 and the 286,but managed to walk away with much of the market nonetheless.andM;When these processors were being designed, Intel did not yet comprehend theabsolute need for binary compatibility with existing software.andP;  The on-chipinterrupt and DMA controllers on the 186 were not compatible with theexternal chips used with the 8086 and 8088, and as a result, the 186 was notusable for DOS-compatible systems.andP;  Despite the total failure of the 186 inthe PC market, it was a big hit for embedded control applications because ofthe on-chip peripherals.andM;With the 286, Intel added a memory management unit based on the segmentregisters of the 8086 architecture.andP;  To provide a protection mechanism andaccess to a larger address space, Intel changed the function of the segmentregisters.andP;  Instead of being used directly to compute addresses, the segmentregisters in the 286 (when operating in its native  protected' mode) insteadserve as pointers to descriptors, which in turn provide protectioninformation and a 24-bit base address.andM;The N= scheme of the 286 has a fundamental flaw: instead of adding N=functions on top of the 8086 architecture in a transparent manner, it changesthe way facilities visible to application programs operate.andP;  Thus, a specialmode - called 'real mode' - was required for compatibility with existingsoftware.andP;  In this mode, the 286 is nothing more than a faster 8086.andM;To access more than 1 Mbyte of address space or gain any protection benefits,compatibility with all existing software must be sacrificed.andP;  This weaknesswas further compounded by the lack of any reasonable way to switch fromprotected mode back to real mode.andP;  IBM and Microsoft then magnified Intel'sblunders by basing the initial implementation of OS/2 on the 286architecture.andM;Finally, with the 386, Intel added two key features: a paged MMU, and a modethat allows existing 8086 applications to be executed within a protectedenvironment.andP;  Recognizing that they finally got it right, Intel has stuck tothe 386 architecture for both a lower-cost implementation (the 386SX) and ahigher-performance implementation (the 486).andM;Late this year, Microsoft will finally begin shipping the 386-specificversion of OS/2 that they should have had three years ago, and IBM-compatiblePCs will begin to emerge from the dark ages.andM;Motorola's PathandM;Motorola's microprocessor evolution has been greatly simplified by thequality of their original architecture.andP;  Because Motorola provided user andsupervisor modes from the start, they have been able to add memorymanagement, cache control, and other system facilities without affectingapplication software compatibility.andP;  Because the 68000 provided 32-bitaddress registers, extending the address space to a full 4 Gbytes has beenrelatively painless.andM;Motorola's 68010 was the first follow-on to the 68000, and the onlysignificant change was in the way bus errors were handled so virtual memorycould be supported.andP;  The 68020 was the first full 32-bit implementation, andwhile several extensions to the instruction set were made, upwardcompatibility was maintained.andM;While Intel chose to add a primitive MMU in the 286 but provided no on-chipcache, Motorola opted instead to add a small cache in the 68020 but keep theMMU as an external chip.andP;  This was a good choice for embedded applications,but the lack of a standard MMU led to a proliferation of incompatible Unixsystems.andP;  Finally, with the 68030, Motorola brought the MMU on-chip.andM;Lessons for the FutureandM;The lessons of this tale aren't too comforting for those processor vendorshoping to win by architectural quality.andP;  In almost every respect, Motorolastarted with a superior architecture and had a smoother evolution to theircurrent implementation, yet Intel has ended up with a bigger piece of themarket.andP;  SPARC advocates may gain considerable comfort from this precedent.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
