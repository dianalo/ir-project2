The method is sensitiveenough but it is complex and a high degree of skill is required in itsuse. It was proposed to investigate the feasibility of using alternativemethods which require less expertise. In a field study the use of a portablesingle-beam infrared spectrophotometer, the Miran 1A General PurposeGas Analyzer, was evaluated and formaldehyde levels measured with thisinstrument were correlated with levels measured simultaneously by theNIOSH method. The instrumental method was evaluated by examining a groupof homes in the St.John's area. In addition, a limited survey of relevantstudy home characteristics was conducted. It was found that no acceptablecorrelation existed between the NOISH-and MIRAN-determined levels. Thelevels of formaldehyde observed in most cases were below the limits ofsensitivity and precision possible with the MIRAN and furthermore, theinfrared method was also found to be susceptible to unidentified interferants.The study was therefore broadened to include a limited field evaluationof another on-site analyzer, the CEA 555, and the prototype of a passiveformaldehyde dosimeter; other applications for the Miran were also established.The CEA was found to offer some advantages in that it is more sensitivethan the Miran. Passive dosimeters were seen to offer a more meaningfultime-weighted average of formaldehyde exposure levels. 11 refs., 2 figs.,5 tabs..</TEXT></DOC>
