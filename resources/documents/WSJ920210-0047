Because the economies of Germany and a number of othermajor industrial nations also have problems, traders aren'tlikely to dump dollars and snap up foreign currencies,analysts say.</LP><TEXT>   The prevailing view is that the dollar is currently at&quot;decent levels&quot; for buying, says Marcos Douer, tradingmanager at Commercial Bank of New York. If the dollar doesdecline in the next week or so, its losses will probably belimited, he says.   Late Friday in New York, the dollar was quoted at 1.5585marks and 125.30 yen, down from Thursday's closing levels of1.5770 marks and 125.73 yen, after the surprisingly weakJanuary U.S. employment data triggered heavy selling.   In early trading in Tokyo Monday, the dollar was at 125.27yen, down from 125.52 yen at Friday's close. Meanwhile, theU.S. currency was trading at 1.5620 marks, down from 1.5820marks on Friday.   Non-farm payrolls were down 91,000 last month on bigdeclines in both service and goods-producing industries. Thecivilian unemployment rate held steady at 7.1%, however.Market expectations were for a non-farm payrolls rise ofabout 33,000. Monthly payrolls data tend to have a big impacton the dollar because they are considered one of the bestgauges of the economy's vigor.   Despite the weak data and talk that further FederalReserve easing will be needed to revive the economy, bullishdollar sentiment is lingering in the market after the NewYear's rally. The dollar rocketed higher last month, largelybecause of chart-related purchases.   &quot;We have bad news from both Germany and the U.S. Long-termplayers want to buy the dollar here,&quot; says Nakhle Zeidan, atrader at Banque Indosuez in New York.   The latest German economic data have indeed discouragedthe selling of dollars against the mark. Unemployment inwestern Germany climbed to 7% in January from 6.5% inDecember; in the former East Germany, the jobless rate leapedto 17% from 11.8%.   The Bundesbank's stubbornly tight monetary policy isblamed by many for sapping the strength of the Germaneconomy. Even though the high yields in the German creditmarkets are seen as attractive, traders say they are becomingincreasingly wary about buying marks because of a belief thatGerman economic growth will decelerate even more in themonths ahead-just as the U.S. economy may begin itslong-awaited rebound.   Because of slower Japanese economic growth, dollar salesagainst the yen have also been limited recently. The Canadiandollar and the Australian dollar are falling against the U.S.dollar because the weak economies of Canada and Australiahaven't been fully revived by the relaxed monetary policiesof the Bank of Canada and the Reserve Bank of Australia.   Underlying demand for the U.S. dollar stems from thebelief that &quot;we've seen the worst of the U.S. economy,&quot; saysMr. Douer of Commercial Bank.</TEXT></DOC>
