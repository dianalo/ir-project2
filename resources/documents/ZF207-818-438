 Having skipped the Feb. 1988 column to providespace for all those C compiler comparisons, I somehow lost count.andP;  The July1989 issue, my Old Moore's Almanac informs me, carried my 12th column.andO;Ironically, it was devoted to calendric computing, but with ne'er a referenceto the historic landmark it represented.andM;I am rectifying the omission this month, but not with a soggy mess ofreminiscence.andP;  After all, one of my mentors since I came to your wonderfulcountry has been Herb &quot;Don't call it 'Frisco&quot; Caen, the doyen of columnists.andO;Herb has produced a sparkling syndicated daily column week in, week out, forover 50 years.andP;  With a track record like that, you are entitled to gloatperiodically.andP;  But with a year's worth of monthly pontifications for COMPUTERLANGUAGE and even throwing in six years of continuous columnity for UNIXReview, some humility should dampen my celebration.andM;Incidentally, J.G.andP;  Owen of Fort Salonga, N.Y.andP;  writes to ask why I am &quot;somuch funnier in UNIX Review as opposed to that other magazine&quot; to which Ireply, &quot;There's a time for every purpose under heaven.&quot;andP;  To nest a further&quot;incidentally,&quot; Caen taught me the golden rule for columnists: respect yourreadership.andP;  He has never failed to acknowledge my input, either in hiscolumn or by personal letter.andP;  Early in my writing career I resolved tofollow his example--readers' letters must be answered.andM;Stylistically, though, our paths diverge.andP;  The hurly-burly of a dailydeadline has generated a form of writing that Caen himself calls&quot;three-dotism.&quot;andP;  You avoid the need for bellelettrist verbiage when bridgingfrom one item to the next by placing the ANSI C ellipsis (...) betweenadjacent topics.andP;  Now that his old mechanical Royal has been replaced by wordprocessing, I'm sure Caen has a one-key macro for those three dots.andP;  I liketo think of Herb's ellipsis as shorthand for the Pythonesque &quot;and now forsomething completely different,&quot; in contrast to its use in C functionprototypes, where it means the parameter list is open-ended.andM;This column was started to encourage helpful debate among programmers on thetopic generally referred to as the human-computer (or computer-human,depending on your priorities) interface.andP;  The area of discourse uneasilystraddles many disciplines, from hard physical sciences such as optics andanthropometry to softer breeds such as computer science, economics, andpsychology.andP;  We need to recognize the relevance of subjects still maddeninglybeyond the scope of scientific analysis (though not through want of trying)such as natural linguistics, pedagogy, and aesthetics (especially thegraphical arts).andP;  It is a daunting prospect, beset with more religiousschisms than those that divide us on programming languages and methodologies.andM;No universally accepted name has been given to this slew of subjects,although &quot;computer ergonomics&quot; is a reasonable candidate.andP;  To some,ergonomics smacks too much of &quot;Are you sitting comfortably?&quot; rather than tehmore trendy issues of how best to present and invite data on a tessellatedscreen.andM;We must remember, though, that as programmers we spend an outrageous numberof hours slaving over hot terminals, so any help from traditionalergonomicists that makes our jobs safer, less tiring, less stressful, andmakes us happier and more productive is clearly welcome.andP;  Many programmershave no objections to work and environmental studies aimed at benefittingcomputer operators, but they seldom pause to consider their own workingconditions: posture, lighting, screen glare, radiation, and keyboard andscreen position.andP;  Ergonomics is not just a synonym for expensive chairs andfurniture (although, alas, some companies give this impression).andP;  Theproceedings of the World Conference on Ergonomics in Computer Systems, heldin Bromma, Sweden, includes many serious studies offering real help for allthese problems.andP;  [1]andM;The increasing interest in the ergonomics of user interfaces over the lastdecade can be easily explained by the PC revolution.andP;  A dramatic growth hasoccurred in both the number and complexity of applications being tackled by anew generation of users.andP;  Unlike the closely supervised corporate mainframeoperators who are trained for a specific set of tasks, this new breed of useris largely self-trained and self-motivated.andM;Further, the variety of programs encountered exacerbates the learningprocess, leading to the so-called &quot;casual user problem.&quot; PC packages cannotvet their users or assume in advance any given set of computer skills.andO;Software developers, as a matter of survival, must address these new marketexpectations regarding all aspects of the user interface, includingease-of-use, self-training manuals, consistency, and on-line help for thecasual user.andM;Yet until recently, user-interface design was often left as a cosmeticafterthought.andP;  &quot;Let's get the program working first,&quot; was the cry, &quot;then wecan devise a pleasant screen and menu sequence.&quot; Even those who recognize theneed to jointly develop the program and interface often question theprogrammers' role and competence.andP;  Judith R. Brown and Steve Cunningham sayin their book Programming the User Interface:andM;Interface design itself is best given to user interface specialists, becauseit requires technical skills in dealing with people and understanding howthey perceive and accomplish work.andP;  Programmers do not have a good trackrecord on user interface design because their education is in how computers,not humans, accomplish work....andP;  Occasionally a single individual will havethe knowledge or intuition to understand how the user works with tasks andwill have the programming skill to make it work, but this is very rare.andP;  [2]andM;No doubt the larger software houses can enlist such design expertise, not tomention specialists in technical writing, packaging, and marketing.andP;  Theadvice is less practical for the smaller independents--whence the burden ofthis column.andP;  Are we, as hard-working programmers and humans, regardless ofpast follies, irreversibly divorced from how we accomplish work?andP;  To me, thepreceding quote rings out as a challenge.andM;I hasten to add that I strongly recommend Brown and Cunningham's book.andP;  Theycover the programming aspects of the user interface with many useful insightsinto interface design.andP;  The book also includes an excellent overview of bothcommand-line and graphical-user-interface approaches.andP;  Examples cover Lotus1-2-3, AutoCAD, UNIX, dBASE IV, Tell-A-Graf, ICARE, the Macintosh Toolbox,Microsoft Windows, Sun NeWS, Actor, NewWave, and the X Window System.andO;Naturally, some care is needed lest you venture too closely towards the &quot;lookand feel&quot; of some of these fine products!andM;Iam less enthusiastic about Wilbert O. Galitz's Handbook of Screen FormatDesign.andP;  [3]  This strange book has no index (so much for human interfaces)and even the revised 1985 edition devotes only two of its 225 pages to theproblem of multipurpose screens.andP;  Curiously, the two pages make up the wholeof Chapter 6.andP;  Another two-page chapter (Chapter 10) deals with graphics.andO;Icons are mentioned once: &quot;Symbols must be meaningful and differentiable fromother symbols.&quot; No, really?andP;  Windows, mice, and pop-up or pull-down menus arenot discussed.andM;As a useful first step to gaining ergonomic insight (I almost wrote&quot;intuition&quot;), I offer a historical overview based in part on my lecture atthe Software Development '89 conference held in Feb. 1989 in Burlinggame,Calif.andP;  My sermon is the relatively new canon of ergonomics: thepeople-centered design principle, more honored in the breach than in theobservance.andM;Ergonomics is a multidisciplinary science that studies those &quot;aspects oftechnology concerned with the application of biological and engineering datato problems relating to the mutual adjustment of man and the machine&quot;(Webster's Third New International Dictionary, 1976).andM;To indicate how quickly the terminology can evolve, the 1976 Websterhs entryfor ergonomics says &quot;see biotechnology,&quot; and this is where you'll find thepreceding definition.andP;  Biotech, in current usage, relates primarily togenetic engineering, while ergonomics has grown to embrace many other fieldsof research beyond those traditionally associated with biology andengineering such as psychology, pedagogy, cognitive sciences, anthropology,sociology, typography, cybernetics, AI, and computer science, to name but afew.andM;The engineering elements of ergonomics can straddle every aspect ofindustrial design, which, depending on the system involved, can draw heavilyon statistics, electronics, chemistry, acoustics, and other applied sciences.andO;Likewise, the biological side of ergonomics is constantly growing beyond thebasics of human physiology to include many fields of the medical science suchas orthopedics, diagnostics neurology, radiology, and optometry.andM;Ergonomics is sometimes called &quot;human engineering,&quot; presumably to contrast itwith inhuman engineering or possibly engineering by nonhumans.andP;  Even thealternative, &quot;human factors engineering,&quot; has misleading connotations ofsocial manipulation.andP;  Perhaps &quot;humane engineering&quot; is a more appropriatesynonym.andM;Ergonomics, in seeking to improve human-machine symbiosis, needs to study athird element: the environment in which the interaction takes place.andP;  Howeverwell engineered a workstation may be and however pretty the fonts and windowsare displayed thereon, user efficiency and comfort as well as screenlegibility can depend critically on mundane (and hence overlooked) factorsbeyond the manufacturer's or programmer's immediate control.andP;  Ergonomicistscan often solve fatigue, backache, and eyestrain problems (all of whichaffect error rate) with simple off-line seating and lighting adjustments.andO;More ways can be found to increase throughput than by adding RAM.andM;When hybridizing from such diverse and comprehensive disciplines, a realdanger exists of ergonomics becoming too flabby a subject to be takenseriously as a real science.andP;  Often, the most commonsensical notions of how adevice should interact with its users are dressed up in obfuscating jargon.andO;And frequently the term &quot;ergonomically designed&quot; is added to a product by theadvertising agency rather than as the genuine result of dedicated planning.andM;We should distinguish the concepts of style and ergonomic design.andP;  In aperfect universe of ungullible buyers, the two concepts might well coincide;what works right would almost always look right, to quote an old engineeringmaxim.andM;In the real world, fads and fashions have been known to influence purchasingdecisions, even in abstract markets such as programming methodologies.andP;  Goodindustrial stylists who can weave their magic with absolutely no adverseergonomic effects are quite rare and should be encouraged.andP;  Those who simplydisguise poor design with a veneer of eye-catching glitter should be shunned.andO;But history is discouraging.andM;Style, of course, is a good thing, and it turns out to play a role inergonomics.andP;  Studies show that pride of ownership contributes to betteroperation and maintenance; the resulting improvement in reliabilityreinforces the pride, and so on.andM;The idea that the design of products intended for human manipulation andinteraction should start with the human side of the equation is relativelynew.andP;  It is difficult to date such things, but Woodson and Conover's HumanEngineering Guide for Equipment Designers, (4) published in 1954, seems tosignal the first concerted effort to establish the &quot;user first&quot; principle asmore than just lip service.andP;  Interestingly, this was the year Norbert Wiener,the father of cybernetics, published his book, The Human Use of Human Beings.andO;(5)  Less interestingly, I wrote my first program for the EDSAC I in 1953.andM;Ironically, one of the first organizations to formally place the peopleproblem ahead of the hardware problem was the U.S.andP;  Air Force weapon-systemdivision.andP;  The personnel subsystem (PSS) concept mandated ergonomicprinciples for weapon design and deployment, although we find no mention ofthe machine-victim interface.andM;The change in attitude can be traced to several factors.andP;  First, machines arebecoming more complex and general.andP;  With a simple, single-purpose device,users can readily decide if the advantages of using it outweigh anyinconveniences or added costs in the interface.andP;  (The decision, of course,may turn out badly; many electric toothbrushes are retired after a few monthsto avoid the unexpected ritual of battery replenishment.)andM;As our gadgets become more complex and general-purpose, designers are forcedto consider ease of use and user educabilty.andP;  With the growing propensity forlitigation by users, manufacturers are increasingly conscious of safety andfitness-of-use factors.andM;Second, the growth of free-market capitalism has given users a choice.andP;  Otherthings being equal (but see my previous warning on style), the better humaninterface will win.andP;  The last sentence hides a possible circularity: &quot;better&quot;is often defined in our culture in terms of market share.andP;  Market share isthe one indisputable, measurable result of a complex experiment carried outby vendors on putative customers.andM;To debate the dangers of the short-term marketing philosophy espoused by manyU.S.andP;  companies would be a digression.andP;  Suffice it to say that rapid stylechanges with no ergonomic justification to gain short-term, volatile marketshare threaten to reduce our competitiveness in the long haul.andM;An objectively superior interface (if we may become mystical for a moment)will have to fight both real and imagined inertia to gain a foothold.andP;  Havingmastered a difficult interface, perverse humans are often loath to shed theirhard-earned skills and even demand that apprentices should not escape thesame tortuous initiation, known as &quot;The Old Soldier Syndrome&quot; in UNIXcircles.andM;A more persistent obstacle comes from maintaining sufficient compatibilitywith the dominant interfaces.andP;  Better mousetraps have often been rejectedbecause they require nonstandard cheese.andP;  The smaller developers are forcedto work within the standards set by Microsoft, IBM, and ATandamp;T unless ashatteringly fruitful innovation can be perceived.andM;Some of the ergonomic subsciences do attempt the objective measurement ofsafety, convenience, efficiency, and acceptability with the varying degreesof success one expects in the softer sciences.andP;  The interpretation of CRTradiation studies, for example, is still controversial, mainly becausecontrolled experiments with subjects shielded from natural radiation oversignificant time spans are notoriously difficult and expensive.andM;Since we are all human (until proved otherwise), we view ourselves asuniquely qualified to judge how well a particular device achieves its designaims.andP;  We do this by actually using the beast and, no matter what thecopywriters tell us, we know if a human-machine interface suits us or not.andM;These inevitably subjective assessments underline the core problem ofergonomics.andP;  We are all wonderfully different in diverse ways.andP;  Ourphysiometrical differences, when relevant, can (or should) be accommodated byproviding suitable adjustments to match the Gaussian distribution of thetarget body sizes.andP;  Psychological and cultural differences (in particular,how different folk conceptualize or model their role in an interactivecomputer system) are trickier but have been subject to diverse studies.andP;  (Fordetails, see Human Factors in Computing Systems: CHI '89, &quot;Wings for theMind,&quot; (6) edited by Ken Bice and Clayton Lewis, and the Apr. 1989 issue ofthe SIGCHI Bulletin.andP;  [7])andM;One of the major problems noted by Woodson and Conover is that the &quot;designerdoes not represent the user...all too often the designer assumes that becausehe is human, he is typical of all people that may eventually use theequipment he designs.&quot;andP;  Programmers and technical writers must overcome thismisconception.andP;  In future columns, I plan to show you some examples ofsoftware and documentation to illustrate the problem.andM;It should be evident that a software package must be designed with awell-defined target class of users in mind.andP;  Avoid the temptation to be allthings to all users.andP;  Doing a limited number of things well is a sounderrecipe for success; witness the relative failures of grandiose integratedpackages.andP;  The entire development cycle must involve the target user.andP;  Theinitial specifications must address what users need as well as what you thinkthey need.andP;  Screen-management design should be prototyped early to establishappropriate navigation, help, and action selection methods.andP;  In addition tothe code debugging cycle, you must plan for interface and documentationdebugging, using several target users.andM;Next month I will discuss the various interface strategies involved inachieving these aims.andP;  Your options largely depend on the platforms andenvironments destined to support your efforts, but a human-factors approachcan improve your product even if the systems software, such as PresentationManager or Macintosh operating system, predetermine many of the interfacedesign decisions.andM;The one golden rule, then, is: &quot;The user comes first.&quot;andM;The advert for Paralegals asked: &quot;Need more money?andP;
