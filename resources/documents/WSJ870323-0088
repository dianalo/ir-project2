In the first half of March, the Hang Seng index, which tracks 33 major stocks, plummeted more than 11% from the record 2939.05 registered March 3. The string of losses ended abruptly Wednesday, though, when the indicator rebounded nearly 95 points, or about 3.5%, in a single session. The index edged lower again Thursday but surged 59.27 points Friday to close the week at 2780.55.    Although earnings-related trading and overseas investors alike have played a role in the recent turbulence, essentially it is a transient, technical reaction to a February rally that saw the Hang Seng index climb nearly 15%, Hong Kong securities analysts say. Brokers as well as analysts expect stocks to settle into a steady upward trend again soon, backed by strong economic and financial fundamentals.    &quot;When the dust finally settles, we expect this market to pick up considerably,&quot; says David Harman, an equities manager at Berisford Cresvale (Far East) Ltd., a British securities firm. Following February's solid performance, Mr. Harman says, &quot;a normal correction of some size could have been expected and, in fact, was overdue.&quot;    The correction was exacerbated by its timing, coming just as major companies were reporting last year's results. &quot;People usually sell into results&quot; in Hong Kong, Mr. Harman says.    Earnings for major companies listed on the colony's stock exchange so far are up at least 30% on average, in line with local expectations. But news that several big groups were planning reorganizations and rights issues spurred profit-taking.    Among the companies seeking to raise money through such issues are Hongkong andamp; Shanghai Banking Corp., Jardine Matheson Strategic Holdings Ltd., Hongkong Land Co. and New World Hotels Ltd. The total cost of those proposed issues to shareholders will be about the equivalent of $897.3 million.    Rights issues contributed to the market's recent slump by forcing local investors to skim profits from their portfolios to finance their portions of the issues, says Stuart Cook, a director of research at the Hong Kong office of James Capel andamp; Co., a British securities firm owned by Hongkong Bank. &quot;Very soon now, the issues should be well and truly discounted in the market,&quot; Mr. Cook says.    Local investors, who have been pushing the market lower, often are quicker to adjust their positions than foreign investors, he says. Many of market's foreign participants started investing only in the past several years -- and since August in particular, when Tokyo's stock market faltered. So they aren't accustomed to the rapid pace of share turnover practiced by many local institutions.    &quot;This is one of the world's busiest markets,&quot; a broker says, noting that the average daily turnover has increased about sevenfold from a year ago. If Hong Kong's average daily turnover of $182 million persists, in a year the equivalent of nearly three-quarters of the exchange's total capitalization of around $60.24 billion will change hands.    Still, even though locals generally trade their portfolios more frequently, much of that liquidity derives from the recent foreign investment. And because foreign institutions have been buying heavily, most were unwilling to take on additional shares to prop up the market when local selling knocked it lower this month. Nor would the foreign houses sell -- and take losses -- at the market's lower levels, so volume has declined even as the market's volatility has increased.    The market should emerge from its current volatility soon and head higher, analysts say, noting that the economic fundamentals backing the market are among the strongest in Asia.    &quot;Hong Kong is the only market in Asia with rapidly improving fundamentals,&quot; says John C. Quinn, a director of Chase Manhattan Trust Co.'s Hong Kong office. &quot;We don't see any big downside risk here.&quot;    A chief factor supporting the market is Hong Kong's strong, export-driven economy, which should grow at least 6% this year, after swelling around 9% last year, the colony's government says. The stability of the local currency, which is officially linked to the U.S. dollar at a rate of 7.8 Hong Kong dollars to one, and relatively low interest rates, which have bolstered local property prices considerably in the past year, are chief factors as well.    &quot;Fundamentally, Hong Kong is one of the strongest markets in the world,&quot; says Caspar Li, an assistant director of research at Vickers da Costa andamp; Co., a brokerage owned by Citicorp.    Mr. Li, though, cautions that unexpected political news always poses a threat to the stock market in the British territory, which will revert to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. When Chinese Communist party leader Hu Yaobang was removed abruptly from his post in January amid student demonstrations in China, Hong Kong's stock market shuddered noticeably, dropping more than 3% in one day.    ---   London, Tokyo Stocks   London shares advanced to a record close Friday in moderate trading. The 100-share index rose 26.5 points to 2017.5, eclipsing Wednesday's high of 2006.6. The Financial Times industrial-share index rose 17.3 to 1598.9.    Investors ended a two-day respite that followed Tuesday's unveiling of the British budget. They expect retail issues to benefit from the budget's personal-tax cuts and the drop in British banks' lending rates, a trader said. And the benefits of lower mortgage costs, resulting from falling interest rates, a drop in money supply and stable inflation, will be &quot;larger than the gains&quot; from tax cuts, the trader said.    Foreign demand, Wall Street's performance Thursday and buying ahead of the new trading quarter, which starts today, helped as well, traders said.    The gold mines rose 12 points to 362.4.    Meanwhile, Tokyo's Nikkei stock average, which fell 60.74 points Thursday, rose 13.35 to 21,657.67 in heavy trading Friday on a late rally in heavy industrial and mining issues.    The stock exchange index rose 2.39 to 1860.70. Volume was about 1.5 billion shares, up from 1.4 billion Thursday.    The Tokyo exchange was closed Saturday as part of its regular holiday schedule.    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The percentage change is since year-end.                                                       % This                               Mar. 19     Mar. 18     Year   U.S. ...................... 275.3       274.1     + 20.7   Britain ................... 591.4       596.2     + 18.8   Canada .................... 421.5       419.1     + 26.5   Japan .................... 1116.4      1128.2     + 18.1   France .................... 450.3       450.5     + 10.3   Germany ................... 203.4       209.8     - 21.7   Hong Kong ................ 1924.6      1924.9     +  8.2   Switzerland ............... 184.9       187.2     -  7.9   Australia ................. 299.5       298.0     + 13.5   World index ............... 426.3       427.4     + 19.5</TEXT></DOC>
