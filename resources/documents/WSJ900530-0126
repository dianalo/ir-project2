In a practice affecting hundreds of thousands of jobseekers, a fast-rising number of companies are checking thepersonal credit reports of prospective employees to judgetheir integrity.</LP><TEXT>   Many jobs applicants may never even know it's happening.That's because companies often don't tell them -- sometimesin violation of the law, critics maintain. Some also questionthe predictive value of the reports and charge that manycompanies misuse them to obtain personal data they aren'tsupposed to consider, such as age or marital status.   Employers using credit reports, however, contend thatknowing how an applicant handles bills, loans and otherfinancial obligations helps predict whether he or she islikely to steal, sell company secrets or otherwise actirresponsibly on the job.   Many banks and retailers that routinely consult creditreports before granting credit lines or loans have long usedthe reports to screen would-be tellers and cashiers. But,citing rising internal theft and concern about theirliability for worker wrongdoing, a broader range of companiesare using the reports to screen for all types of positions.   The boom in credit screening follows tight limits onpolygraph testing that took effect last year. In response,the nation's three big credit-reporting agencies beganmarketing their files to employers hungry for an alternativeevaluation tool.   Equifax Inc. of Atlanta, which started selling itsemployee-screening reports in July 1988 just after thelie-detector ban was signed into law, claims it sold 350,000of its reports to some 15,000 employers in 1989. It saysdemand in the first quarter of this year ran 71% ahead of thesame period last year. Trans Union Credit Information Co. ofChicago began selling employee-screening reports lastNovember and says it sold nearly 26,000 in March alone. TRWInc.'s credit data division in Orange, Calif., introduced itsreports in December but declines to release figures.   Some employers praise the reports. After a rise in theftthat it traced to employees, Barry's Jewelers Inc., Monrovia,Calif., started using credit reports last month to supplementjob interviews, applications and &quot;pencil and paper&quot; tests,which seek to gauge integrity through multiple-choicequestions on ethical dilemmas. &quot;It's one more addedprecaution,&quot; says Carolyn J. Harrington, director of lossprevention and internal audit.   Of 62 candidates screened during the first three weeks ofthe program, Barry's rejected 16, including three forproblems arising from credit reports. &quot;We deal with loosediamonds, we deal with highly resalable merchandise,&quot; Ms.Harrington adds. &quot;You have to take every opportunityavailable to you to prevent hiring a thief.&quot;   Nordstrom Inc., the department store chain based inSeattle, runs credit checks on finalists for &quot;sensitive&quot; jobsin its security, financial and credit departments. &quot;Whensomebody's having financial problems, there's more pressureon them to do things they otherwise wouldn't do,&quot; says JohnWalgamott, who as the chain's credit manager oversees 400people who handle customer charge accounts. &quot;One person couldhit you for thousands of dollars.&quot;   Abbott Laboratories, a Chicago-based maker of medicalsupplies, evaluates credit reports as &quot;part of the routinereference-checking on everybody,&quot; says Ellen Walvoord,director of corporate communications. &quot;If a person hadserious financial problems as revealed in their creditreport, it could affect their suitability for certainpositions,&quot; she adds, declining to be more specific.   At less than $5 each, credit reports are cheap. They arealso simple to obtain, since the big credit agencies sellonline computer access to their data bases.   Not every company is biting, but those that are often areskittish about discussing the practice. J.C. Penney Co.consults the reports on a &quot;selective basis,&quot; says aspokesman, but he wouldn't elaborate. &quot;We really don't careto talk about how we're using it,&quot; he says.   Secrecy can affect job seekers, too. Under the Fair CreditReporting Act, the primary federal law on credit reports,credit agencies must tell applicants they are being probedonly if their files contain public records on &quot;adverse&quot;matters, such as arrests, suits, court judgments and taxpenalties. About 8% of reports contain such records, TRWsays.   Employers, meanwhile, needn't inform job seekers about acredit check when they apply (though many do so onapplication forms). But when rejecting someone &quot;either whollyor partly because of information contained&quot; in a creditreport, the law says a company is supposed to let that personknow and identify the agency supplying the report -- stepsoften ignored, those familiar with industry practicescontend.   &quot;People are being denied employment because of what's intheir credit report, and are never told that's the reason,&quot;says Ken Yarbrough, a San Rafael, Calif., credit consultantwho once managed security for TRW's credit data business.   &quot;It would not surprise me that users of credit reports arenot aware of their obligations,&quot; says Jean Noonan, associatedirector for credit practices at the Federal TradeCommission, which regulates credit report practices. Withoutdisclosure, she adds, people might never learn to check fortroubles or errors in their records.   Sunday K. Summer of Bossier, La., says she was rejectedfor six different jobs as a hospital scrub nurse and drugstore clerk last year after employers checked her creditreport. The report states that her college loans weredelinquent -- she says they were deferred -- and also refersto a bankruptcy-law filing made by her husband in 1981, whenhe divorced his previous wife. The doctor that finally hiredher as an assistant said &quot;that he had done some investigatingand knew that I needed the job based on my debts&quot; --specifically a $14,000 car loan that he couldn't have knownabout, she says, unless he had checked her credit report.   &quot;It really felt awkward,&quot; Ms. Summer says. Having debts,she adds, &quot;doesn't mean I'm not going to be a good worker.&quot;   Barry's Jewelers and Nordstrom say they strictly followthe law when rejecting applicants for credit concerns; Abbottdeclines to comment on its procedures. At Dallas-based EDSCorp., when job offers are rescinded because of concernsarising from credit reports, applicants initially are toldmerely that &quot;it's because of the background investigation,&quot;says Jon T. Senderling, public relations manager. Only &quot;if aperson asks further,&quot; he says, does the company specify thereason. Mr. Senderling insists that &quot;everything we do iscompletely within&quot; the law.   But Ms. Noonan of the FTC says companies must identify therole of credit reports to spurned applicants forthrightly,not just when asked.   Interpretations of credit reports can vary widely. Oneemployer might balk at hiring someone with a string of lateVisa payments, while another might overlook more seriousproblems, even loan defaults or bankruptcy.   The lack of standards can lead to abuses. Besidesfinancial history and other background information, creditreports may note a person's age, marital status anddependents -- personal data most employers don't seek onapplications or in interviews because, under equal employmentlaws, considering them is discriminatory.   Yet Trans Union specifically sees its report as a way toanswer &quot;some of the questions that you can't ask anapplicant,&quot; says Pat Malloy, a product support coordinator.&quot;This can fill in the holes.&quot;   David F. Linowes, a University of Illinois professor andexpert on privacy issues, says he believes it &quot;is notuncommon&quot; for employers to exploit credit reports forpersonal information that could unfairly -- and illegally --scuttle the chances of job applicants. People &quot;do not haveadequate protection,&quot; he says.   Moreover, some employee-testing experts contend creditreports can't reliably predict trustworthiness. They notethat credit records can contain inaccuracies, honest peoplecan accrue bad credit records and people with clean creditrecords aren't immune to temptation. &quot;Managers naively assumethere's a link between a poor credit rating and theftexposure,&quot; says John W. Jones of London House, a Chicagopersonnel evaluating firm.   Scrutinizing credit reports before hiring would flag nomore than 10% of &quot;all the people who are acting irresponsiblyon the job,&quot; estimates Val J. Arnold, vice president ofPersonnel Decisions Inc., a Minneapolis testing firm.   Credit reporting agencies and companies can't cite studieslinking personal financial problems to dishonesty; they sayanecdotal experience and common sense prove the value ofcredit reports.   Still, William Byham, president of Development DimensionsInternational Inc., a Pittsburgh-based personnel testingfirm, worries that companies are bound to unjustly rejectmany promising applicants if credit reports continue to gainappeal. &quot;Everybody's looking for a quick fix,&quot; he says. But&quot;you have to spend a little time and money on selection ifyou want to get good people.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
