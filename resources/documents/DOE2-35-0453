The reportcontains fact sheets (technical descriptions) and data sheets (cost anddesign information) for the technologies. Cost figures and schematicdiagrams of the technologies are included. The following alternativeenergy technologies appear to be potentially cost-effective: Heat pumpswhich use influent or effluent waste water as their heat source, forsupplying process or building heat; Geothermal direct-use systems forlarge energy loads when geothermal source is adequate; Wind-power systemsfor large electrical loads when annual wind flux is adequate; Passivesolar systems where they can be cost-effectively integrated into theoverall architectural design of a facility; Low-head hydro systems maybe appropriate for smaller plants which have an available head greaterthan three meters.</TEXT></DOC>
