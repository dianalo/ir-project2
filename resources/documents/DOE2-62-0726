This is primarily a result of the darkand dirty environment inside a tank. Even after a tank has been cleaned,the floor may be covered with heavy corrosion or scale that makes itdifficult to see holes or corrosion pits. In addition, most storage tankshave only three or four openings which allow light into the tank. Althoughthese openings provide sufficient light so one can see large objects,flashlights must be used for a detailed inspection of the floor. Locatingleaks in a tank floor is further complicated by the size of the holes,which can vary from a pin hole to as large as a hard hat. However, moreoften than not, holes in steel tank floors are random scatterings ofone-quarter inch or smaller. These are easy to overlook.
