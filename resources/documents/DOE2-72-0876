A high diagnosis andinformative value, simplicity and non-invasiveness of the method in thedetection of this congenital developmental defect of the terminal ureterand related complications were emphasized. Some advantages of the methodover excretory urography as a common method of diagnosis of ureterocelewere noted. Echography was particularly effective in lowered renal function,in the doubling of the upper urinary tracts and segmental ureterohydronephrosis.Ultrasonography results could influence the type of surgical interventionexcluding in some cases the use of angiography. When used after the operationthe method provided ample information on its results. The method effectivelysupplemented excretory urography and could replace it in some cases tolessen radiation exposure of a patient.</TEXT></DOC>
