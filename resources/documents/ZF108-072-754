(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Diane BernardandM;Microsoft Corp. will try to woo printer makers next week with the officialdebut of its PostScript-compatible printer language, but the firm still facesa formidable foe in Adobe Systems Inc.'s successful original, industryobservers said.andM;The software giant's forthcoming MS-PDL 1.0 is fully compatible with Adobe'sPostScript printer language and supports Adobe's Type 1 PostScript outlinefonts as well as Apple Computer Inc.'s Royal fonts, according to Dan Steele,marketing director of the firm's Printer Business Unit in Redmond, Wash.andM;While Steele revealed some details of MS-PDL at a recent printer conference,Microsoft officials next week will elaborate on the company's plans toenhance and license the language, sources said.andM;Banking on the theory that OS/2 will be better served by sophisticated outputsystems, Steele said, Microsoft plans to beef up its PostScript-compatiblelanguage with elements of the graphical programming interface (GPI) sourcecode used in Presentation Manager.andM;Doing so will enable both the printer and the screen to speak the samegraphics language, providing a more exact match between display and printedpage.andM;Microsoft will also plant hooks in MS-PDL that will allow it to exploitfuture hardware systems, Steele said.andP;  Some manufacturers, for example, areconsidering porting PostScript controllers to Reduced Instruction SetComputer (RISC)-based processors to speed PostScript's notoriously slowprocessing speed.andP;  MS-PDL will let licensees exploit such integration tooptimize performance, he said.andM;MS-PDL eventually will support color output, and Microsoft also plans todevelop a version that can print the Japanese kanji alphabet, Steele said.andO;&quot;Our goal is to keep extending and enriching the language to build up OS/2printing options.&quot;andM;Despite such assurances, industry observers say the firm faces a grim battleagainst Adobe's already entrenched and well-developed PostScript language.andM;Noting that Adobe already offers support for color and the kanji alphabet inits PostScript language, Michael Weiss, president of MWA Consulting in PaloAlto, Calif., said Microsoft needs to convince potential licensees that itsimplementation of PostScript has clear advantages over Adobe's.andM;Adding GPI extensions to MS-PDL clearly offers benefits to OS/2 users thatAdobe does not offer, but Microsoft will need to convince printer vendors ofthat, he said.andM;Microsoft plans to license the language this year to third-party vendors forinclusion in PostScript printers, Steele said, adding that Microsoft'sroyalty fees will make it more attractive to printer makers than Adobe'sPostScript printer language.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
