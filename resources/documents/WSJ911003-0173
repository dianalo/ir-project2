There can be noquestioning the president's high purpose: &quot;to make the worlda less dangerous place than ever before in the nuclear age.&quot;But do the administration's sweeping denuclearizationproposals accomplish this purpose? There hasn't even been asober and balanced critique.   Canceling the alert status of our strategic, long-rangeforces, especially ICBMs, makes some sense. The odds of asurprise Soviet attack against those bombers and ICBMslocated in the U.S. were remote at best even in the worstdays of the Cold War. Taking most short-range ground-basedtactical weapons out of the inventory might possibly bejustified. Most were dead ducks because Congress or ourallies did not want them. But this is hardly the whole story.</LP><TEXT>   In large part the new policies are being justified by thereduction in the Soviet threat. It has also been argued thatremoving tactical nuclear weapons will get them out of thehands of Soviet dissidents. Neither proposition isself-evident.   While the conventional threat is clearly reduced, there isno evidence of a cutback in Soviet strategic nuclearweaponry. Perhaps it is simply a matter of a time lag, but itcould also represent considered policy. With a deterioratingability to maintain its conventional forces, not to mentionmodernizing them to match our impressive smart weaponry, whatdoes the Soviet Union have to fall back on if not nuclearweapons? Moreover, its nuclear arsenal represents its lastvestige of superpower status. In any event, Mr. Gorbachev'sresponse to the U.S. initiative has been tepid at best;perhaps Mr. Yeltsin is a better horse for us to ride. Butsuppose neither comes through?   As to the removal of tactical weapons not under thecontrol of the central authority, the cost-benefit ratio isnot all that clear. So far it would appear that the republicshave two interests in these weapons: first to be able toexercise a veto over their use by the Soviet or Russianauthorities and second, to have a hedge against thoseauthorities. How do these interests conflict with our own?   In any event, we do not know that the U.S. initiative willbear any dividends visa-vis the Soviets. With voices such asEduard Shevardnadze warning that another coup by communistreactionaries is not to be discounted, the U.S. initiativemight be a bit premature.   Other direct effects are troubling. The Soviet Union isnot the only hostile or potentially hostile power withnuclear weapons or seeking them. And several have or areseeking chemical and biological weapons, along with suchdelivery systems as ballistic missiles. How are such statesbest deterred from acquiring and from using such weapons?   It is not an easily answered question. Some believe, forexample, that Iraq was deterred from using its chemical andbiological weapons against U.S. troops out of fear of a U.S.nuclear response. We will retain a nuclear inventory underthe proposed reductions, but will it be of the right sort?Should we rely on strategic nuclear weapons to meet militaryneeds that arise in a foreign theater of operations?   Our strategic nuclear weapons are a long way away and areof very large yield. Systems such as sea-launched cruisemissiles, which might have been a weapon of choice to deter athreat to U.S. forces deployed overseas, are to be removed.Under what logic? Tactical aircraft delivering bombs mightstill be available, provided they have airfields to fly from.Since our aircraft carriers will not be able to carry outlocal nuclear missions, we will be left with precious fewoptions.   We had better articulate these options or this initiativecould have the perverse effect of inducing nuclearproliferation. Allies who doubt the U.S. ability to deterwith weapons held thousands of miles from their homelands, orpotential adversaries sharing a similar doubt, may be inducedto secure their own capabilities.   More broadly, what effect is the president's initiativelikely to have on other U.S. defense programs? It is hard tosee how the administration can justify the expensive B-2 at atime we are destroying strategic systems, including bombers.   It can and should be argued that our dependence on ourremaining nuclear forces demands systems that are safe,efficient and tailored to the task. All of these are thegoals of future nuclear testing. But will the euphoriastirred up by this &quot;bold&quot; initiative lead Congress to demandan end to testing? Nor do these reductions make the StrategicDefense Initiative any less important, but it too could drownin this flood of euphoria. And finally, what of the defensebudget more generally? It already is slated for massive cuts;a feeding frenzy triggered by the administration'sdenuclearization initiative could lead to more.   While it is not inevitable that all or any of thesepotentially adverse consequences will flow from theadministration's surprise announcement, neither is itinevitable that good consequences will flow.   One might have thought an issue of such importance wouldhave been the subject of careful debate before the public andCongress and with our allies before its adoption. It mighteven have been an excellent subject for debate in the comingpresidential election. But, alas, there is no chance of that.   The Democrats, with their affinity for reduced militarypreparedness, have adopted the proposals uncritically; ifanything, they say they do not go far enough. As for theRepublicans, it is a cinch they would have been critical hadthis been a Carter proposal. One thing seems certain. Theclear policy division that separated pro-defense Republicansand anti-defense Democrats has been blurred. But that is notthe same thing as saying that the initiative was in thenational interest.   ---   Mr. Weiss, a former ambassador, was assistant secretary ofstate for politico-military affairs in the 1970s.</TEXT></DOC>
