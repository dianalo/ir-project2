Nies flatly denies that his equity share reflects a desireto hold on or control.andM;FloatedandM;A percentage has been transferred to employees every year since 1981, andthat policy will continue.andP;  He was planning a modest public listing in 1987,primarily as a liquidity basis for his 1,000 share-owning employees, but thatwas shelved when Wall Street crashed.andP;  Cincom will be floated when themarkets are right, and with its 22-year track record, Nies claims, it will bein better position than most software companies.andP;  As regards products, Cincomhas been very quiet about Systems Center acquiring Net/Master and itsAustralian developer, Software Developers Pty Ltd (CI No 1,385).andM;The general perception is that Systems Center whipped the product from underCincom's nose, along with UK managing director Terry Booth, and a 125-strongsales force.andP;  Not so, says Nies.andP;  Cincom made a decision not to renew itsmarketing agreement with Software Developers, and actually assisted SystemsCenter in the acquisition process.andP;  Net/Master was the least strategicproduct in Cincom's portfolio, and didn't fit with future product plans.andP;  -andM;Cincom founder TOM NIES talks to Janice McGinnandM;Cincom will concentrate on several areas including application developmenttools, manufacturing application systems, project management and control,text management and development, relational databases, and a full life cycletechnology interoperable across a range of environments.andP;  With such ambitiousplans, Net/Master was just one product too many.andP;  Cincom's current rangecomprises three sectors - database, application products and manufacturingsystems - and they each contribute a third of net sales.andP;  The fastest growingsector is manufacturing application systems, and new business in the US grewby 70% last year.andP;  Nies says that application development is the mostprofitable sector, while the database division is largest and expected togrow next year with the launch of a Unix version.andP;  Cincom forecasts that eachsector will experience between 40% and 45% growth in the coming 12 months,and the company as a whole will grow by 11%.andP;  Nies expects profits, whichCincom has the right not to disclose, to rise for three reasons.andP;  Recurringrevenue will form a larger percentage of total revenue; secondly, as revenuegrows, research and development will represent a smaller percentage; thirdly,new products and add-ons will generate better rates of new business.andP;  Cincomhas seen a shift in the amount of revenue derived from IBM and DEC equipment,and Nies says that in terms of manufacturing systems, five years ago theratio was 4:1 in IBM's favour, and that is now reversed.andP;  This is not only anindication that companies are adopting a decentralised structure, but areflection of the cost of transactions on mid-range equipment.andP;  An IBMtop-end mainframe transaction costs between $100,000 and $150,000 per MIPS,but the an equivalent transaction on the RS/6000 costs just $5,000.andP;  Niesbelieves that such economics bode ill not only for IBM's mainframe revenue,but for DEC and any other proprietary manufacturer.andM;Collapse overnightandM;So, could the IBM mainframe market collapse sooner than expected? Nies has nodoubt that were it not for tremendous efforts on IBM's part, it couldcollapse overnight, and if there is one overriding factor ensuring that thereis a continuing market for IBM's proprietary and expensive technology, it isthe cost of conversion.andP;  He also suggests that IBM is using softwaretechnology to drive users up to MVS since the best software is at the top end- the expensive end - of MVS-VSE-RISC pyramid.andP;  DB2 is the premier softwareproduct in IBM's stable, and AD/Cycle is the future direction.andP;  The catch isthat AD/Cycle requires the Repository which needs DB2, and DB2 is onlyavailable at the top end.andP;  Cincom, claims Nies, is going to act as acounterthrust to the hardware vendors by developing &quot;womb-to-tomb&quot; full lifecycle technology.andP;  1991 announcements will go beyond what IBM is offeringwith AD/Cycle, and the company is planning a range of relational productsthat will run under MVS, VSE and Unix.andP;  There will be phased roll-out of newproducts that have been under development for five years, and they willinclude technology and components from a number of unidentified developmentpartners.andP;  Nies says he has no interest in hoarding the technology, and itwill be made available to other vendors - including DEC and IBM.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
