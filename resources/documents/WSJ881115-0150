Meanwhile, smaller independent oil producers, which don't have the major oil companies' extremely profitable refining and marketing and chemical operations, generally plan to cut spending.    Both groups, however, will continue to spend more of their exploration dollars overseas and in the search for natural gas, both in the U.S. and abroad. Industry officials discussed their capital spending plans here at the annual meeting of the American Petroleum Institute.    Exxon Corp. has budgeted about $7 billion for capital spending next year, about the same as in each of the previous two years, said Chairman Lawrence Rawl. He said Exxon will spend roughly 35% to 40% of its exploration and development funds in the U.S. next year, with the rest going overseas. &quot;Oil in the U.S. is becoming rare,&quot; Mr. Rawl said. In the early 1980s, the oil industry spent about 70% of its exploration and production funds in the U.S.    Mr. Rawl and other executives at the institute's meeting said that forecasting crude prices and budgets is particularly difficult, because of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries meeting next week, when members again will discuss curbing production that exceeds OPEC quotas. &quot;It's very risky,&quot; Mr. Rawl said. &quot;It's not like budgeting a new hamburger stand.&quot;    Generally, oil industry officials have a dour outlook for prices. Cyrus Tahmassebi, chief economist for Ashland Oil Inc., predicted that regardless of the outcome of the OPEC meeting, there is a 60% chance that oil prices will move in a range of $10 to $15 a barrel, adjusted for inflation, over the next 15 years. He also said there is a 15% chance oil will trade between $7 and $10, and a 25% chance of $15 to $18 oil.    On the New York Mercantile Exchange yesterday, West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark domestic crude, closed at $14.25, up 30 cents. A year ago when oil companies were budgeting sizable increases in capital spending, oil traded at more than $18 a barrel.    Many companies are taking an uncertain, almost timid approach to spending. &quot;It has to be the worst moment to do your budgets,&quot; said James Ross, president of BP America Inc., a unit of British Petroleum Co. &quot;If the oil price doesn't get to $10 but stays within $1 of today,&quot; he said, &quot;we would spend around $2 billion.&quot; That would be unchanged from its 1988 spending.    BP America, among others, would quickly cut spending if prices fell to $10, but would be reluctant to raise spending if prices were to go higher than expectations. &quot;In view of the uncertainty on oil prices, I don't think spending on the exploration and production sector will be more next year than last,&quot; said Richard Morrow, chairman of Amoco Corp. He said Amoco will spend slightly less than its 1988 budget of $3.8 billion and expects 1989 spending to be about the same as that budgeted sum or down slightly.    Amoco, along with many other companies, acquired oil and gas properties this year, finding it less expensive to acquire reserves than to explore. Chevron Corp., which recently acquired $2.6 billion of Gulf of Mexico reserves from Tenneco Inc., will spend, at most, 10% more in 1989 than the $3.2 billion it spent in 1988, according to Kenneth Derr, Chevron's vice chairman, who is soon to be chairman of the company. With the Tenneco transaction, which isn't included in the capital spending figure, Chevron becomes the nation's largest producer of natural gas.    Chevron will spend 40% of its exploration and production budget in the U.S. in 1989 and the rest internationally, Mr. Derr added. Chevron, he said, also plans some increases in its refining and marketing, or so-called downstream, operations.    At Sun Exploration andamp; Production Co., &quot;Our capital budget will be much more gas-oriented,&quot; said Robert Hauptfuhrer, chairman of what now is the nation's largest independent oil company, after its spinoff from Sun Co.    Texaco Inc. will take a &quot;cautious approach to exploration,&quot; Chairman Alfred DeCrane said. This year, Texaco expects to spend about 10% more than the $2.1 billion it forecast earlier in the year, according to Clem Malin, general manager of the company's corporate planning department. Mr. Malin calculated that Texaco's 1989 capital spending will be about the same for continuing operations, even though divestitures will push the actual number lower.    Phillips Petroleum Co. expects to spend a little less than its budgeted $950 million for 1988, and expects next year to be little changed. &quot;Next year, I don't see us doing a whole lot different than this year,&quot; Chairman C.J. &quot;Pete&quot; Silas said.    Independent oil companies, however, are cutting capital spending budgets. &quot;When you have lower prices, you have less money to spend,&quot; said Charles Blackburn, chairman of Maxus Energy Corp. The large independent oil producer allocated $240 million for 1988 capital spending, but expects to spend just $190 million this year, and less than that next year.    Louisiana Land andamp; Exploration Co., another independent, expects to spend $175 million in 1988, but plans to spend just $150 million in 1989. Because of reduced revenue, the company earlier this month announced another staff cut. &quot;You think with your head instead of your heart,&quot; E.L. Williamson, Louisiana Land chairman, said. &quot;Your heart says it will get better. Your head says it may stay like this for some time.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
