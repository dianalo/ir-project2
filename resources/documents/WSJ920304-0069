Neighbors persuaded him to takedown the sign on the roof a few years ago, but fans stillshow up at all hours.   &quot;People just ask around,&quot; he says. &quot;They ask where theworm man is.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The 80-year-old Mr. Sroda is the only resident of thisfarming community known to brag about baking worm cookies,coaching basketball-playing wigglers and making televisionappearances with a dancing Canadian night crawler namedHerman.   &quot;They call me Mr. Worms, Mr. Night Crawler and Mr.Wiggler,&quot; he says in a breathless torrent. &quot;I am teaching thegospel all over the world that the worm is a valuable animal.Appreciate it, be good to it, take care of it.&quot;   Mr. Sroda's own wigglers -- all three million of them --live in roomy Styrofoam pens, sleep on fluffy beds ofsphagnum peat and dine on secret-recipe feed. Sometimes healso serves them brown sugar or chocolate ice cream fordessert and pipes in a bit of Hawaiian-guitar music because,he claims, the worms &quot;like the vibrations.&quot;   But while he promotes the virtues of worms as fish bait,the &quot;Worm Czar,&quot; as he calls himself, won't sell his ownsubjects because, then, still more sportsmen would show up intheir pickup trucks and pester him. Moreover, except forresearch, Mr. Sroda rarely goes fishing himself. &quot;I don'thave the patience,&quot; he sputters. &quot;I have to be moving all thetime.&quot;   That usually rules out personal replies to the lettersasking advice on raising worms that pour in from as far awayas the Netherlands and Egypt. One afternoon recently, ninebig boxes of them were stacked up by the door. &quot;These peoplewant help,&quot; declares Mr. Sroda who, for $5.95, sends a copyof his book, &quot;No Angle Left Unturned: Facts AboutNightcrawlers.&quot;   But he doesn't rely on book sales alone to spread theword. Indeed, his lab walls are plastered with more publicityphotos than a Hollywood tourist trap. There are glossies ofhim shaking hands with fishing-show hosts, trading yuks withJohnny Carson and introducing his slimy sidekicks to BillyCrystal, Priscilla Presley and Shecky Greene.   Also tacked up is a holiday snapshot of Herman coiled upunder a tiny Christmas tree. &quot;I saved this guy from thegarbage can when he was only about 3 1/2 inches long,&quot; Mr.Sroda says, gently pulling 16-inch Herman out from under thelittle orange blanket that covers the floor of his privatepen. Dangling between his master's fingers, the celebritywiggler begins to undulate.   &quot;People think that when you're called a worm you're calledsomething undesirable,&quot; Mr. Sroda says. &quot;I think it'swonderful.&quot;   Although most people still don't cozy up to a squirmycreature that slithers through mud and manure, researchersare experimenting with worms as sources of livestock feed andfertilizer. Scientists are hoping that worms'garbage-gobbling capacity can help ease the landfillshortage, and homeowners are paying up to $19 a pound forcompost-munching red worms.   They are available, for instance, from Mary Appelhof, aKalamazoo, Mich., worm advocate, who has sold 24,000 copiesof her book, &quot;Worms Eat My Garbage&quot; and has organized severalconferences of international worm researchers. George Srodahas yet to attend one of these scholarly gatherings, but anadmiring Ms. Appelhof says Mr. Sroda is a walkingencyclopedia on the subject, adding that he &quot;certainly getspeople's attention.&quot;   Like some underground P.T. Barnum, Mr. Sroda dips liveworms in nontoxic paint, and they create &quot;worm art,&quot; wigglingacross canvas. He videotapes his night crawlers dancing.Ultraloud music makes them jump and shimmy. His latest videofeatures Herman nudging a pea-sized basketball across aminiature court, pushing it maybe an inch or so into the airand, after a bit of teetering, dumping it through a tinyhoop. &quot;He's the only worm in the world that will do that,&quot;boasts Mr. Sroda, who admits that capturing this moment inworm history required 130 hours of taping.   Mr. Sroda learned the art of promotion -- and made a smallfortune -- peddling turkeys door-to-door in the 1950s. Healso marketed a manure-based concoction called &quot;Sroda'sTurkey Peat&quot; and sold dyed turkey-feather &quot;flowers&quot; toflorists, striptease dancers and flamboyant wrestling legendGorgeous George.   But in the early 1960s, the turkey baron stumbled across anew challenge while watching some luckless fishermen baittheir hooks. &quot;They were pulling out half-dead, dried-up,shriveled-up worms,&quot; recalls Mr. Sroda, who thereupon soldhis turkey business and barreled off to develop a moreperfect fish bait.   By day, he read worm literature. After dark, he wanderedthrough neighbors' yards and pastures with a flashlight,rounding up night crawlers.   &quot;I knew he was kind of kooky,&quot; sighs Susan Sroda, who wentalong with her husband's quest until some worms he had leftin the family refrigerator found their way into one of hersalads. Wiggler headquarters was promptly moved to the oldturkey slaughterhouse that still serves as Mr. Sroda's lab.   Then there was the afternoon the Worm Czar absent-mindedlyblew his nose in a restaurant, remembering only when thewaitress screamed that he had stuffed several dozen nightcrawlers into his handkerchief that morning. &quot;It didn'tbother me a bit,&quot; he says proudly.   In the early 1970s, he sold his growing worm-food andbedding business to concentrate on breeding bigger worms,winning them a wider public following and -- to his wife'sdismay -- experimenting with worms as food. &quot;You can bakethem and boil them or dry them out, grind them up and putthem in your cookies and cakes,&quot; Mr. Sroda says.   Unappetizing perhaps, but the idea has some nutritionalmerit. &quot;It is very high-grade protein, it's better thanbeefsteak,&quot; says British entomolgist Clive Edwards, now onthe Ohio State University faculty. &quot;They taste rather nice,actually. Cooked.&quot;   Unfortunately, most talk-show hosts wouldn't taste wormcookies on the air. And, ultimately, Mr. Sroda abandoned thepitch because of concern that young TV viewers would starteating wigglers that hadn't been cleaned properly. He didn'twant to be accused of poisoning anybody.   Currently, Mr. Sroda turns down most interview requeststhat require travel, preferring instead to work on perfectinga worm feed that will make his wigglers look, taste and smellbetter to fish.   A few months ago, he tried feeding a few crawlers volcanicash that a fan had sent from Washington's Mount St. Helens,but it didn't seem to have any effect.   The same was true for dry cement, which a friend suggestedis high in minerals. &quot;I killed them,&quot; laments the Worm Czar.&quot;All they were were sinkers when I got through.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
