Sessions said Thursay the bureau is examining a wide range ofpossible criminal violations.   A 23-year-old Cornell University graduate student has toldfriends he created the virus, a tiny program that spreads throughoutcomputer networks and disrupts them.   Sessions, however, told reporters ``there has to be a verycareful and deliberate look at it before I would ever go out andsuggest that a person had actually committed a crime.''   ``You have to move carefully, and I think we've done it properlyin this case,'' he added.   Sessions said investigators are trying to determine whetherstatutes concerning wire fraud, malicious mischief or unlawfulaccess to stored communications may have been broken.   Earlier this week, the FBI said it was focusing on a federal lawthat prohibits fraud or related activity in connection withcomputers, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986.   Cornell student Robert T. Morris Jr. has told friends that hecreated the computer virus that disabled thousands of computers lastweek, but didn't intend for it to spread as it did.   ``We often look at intent as being knowing and intentional doingof an act which the law forbids and knowing that the law forbids itto be done,'' Sessions said. ``But we also have other statutes whichdeal simply with knowingly doing something.''   The malicious-mischief statute to which Sessions referred carriesa maximum 10-year prison term for anyone who willfully interfereswith the use of any communications line controlled by the U.S.government.   The unlawful-access law makes it a crime to prevent authorizedaccess to electronic communications while they are in electronicstorage. It carries a maximum six-month jail term if maliciousdestruction or damage is not involved. The virus incapacitatedcomputer systems, leaving their owners unable to gain access to datastored in them.   On another subject at a news conference, Sessions said the FBI isexamining allegations by some Hispanic FBI agents that they havebeen targets of retaliation within the bureau for testifying in aclass-action suit alleging harassment of Hispanic agents.   He said ``we are looking at'' the allegations, which are now partof the suit pending in U.S. District Court in El Paso, Texas.</TEXT></DOC>
