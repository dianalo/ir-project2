ROTHBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Richard Gephardt stood in the brightsunshine on the steps of the Capitol building and delivered themessage that has carried him to the front rank of the Democraticpresidential field.   It was tough talk about trade and the problems of Americanworkers.   His critics call Gephardt's message protectionist. They decrythe undeniable fact that this Washington insider is running againstthe establishment.   But the Missouri congressman appears to be getting a positiveresponse. No other candidate has a message that has caught hold soeffectively with a large portion of the Democratic Party electorate.   Gephardt may fall short in the race for the Democraticpresidential nomination. The party may turn to Gov. MichaelDukakis' technocratic appeal, to Sen. Albert Gore Jr.'s toughdefense and foreign policy message or to Jesse Jackson'santi-establishment platform.   But Gephardt's strong run for the nomination already hasdelivered a message to the the party, one that might outlive hiscandidacy.   A strong tribute to the Gephardt message came in the Republicanpresidential debate in Atlanta last Sunday when Rep. Jack Kemp ofNew York turned to Kansas Sen. Bob Dole and accused him of sounding``just like Dick Gephardt.''   When Dole campaigns in South Carolina he unabashedly supportslegislation to restrict textile imports. So does Pat Robertson.   The reason is simple. Over 45 percent of the jobs in SouthCarolina are in the textile industry and the state has lost 126plants.   A staple of the Gepardt message is reference to an editorial inthe Wall Street Journal that referred to the trade deficits as``just a fact of life.''   Then he said he'd like the editorial writer to come with him toBettendorff, Iowa, where 6,000 workers in three differentindustries have recently lost their jobs because of foreigncompetition.   ``Sit across the table as I did from live human beings and havethem tell you what it's like to lose their life insurance, losetheir health insurance, lose their pension, what it's like to gohome and tell their families that they've lost their jobs, thatthey're going to stand in an unemployment line or a welfare line,to tell them it's just a fact of life,'' he said.   He referred to electronics workers in New Hampshire and textileworkers in South Carolina and said, ``Ladies and gentlemen, I don'tlike those facts of life.''   He said it was time for America to ``get control of our economicdestiny,'' a powerful message to Americans who feel uneasy over thenation's enormous trade deficits.   Four years ago, Republicans derided as protectionist, WalterMondale's call for legislation that would require a certain portionof foreign products to be manufactured in the United States,so-called domestic content legislation.   The label stuck. It was special interest legislation, a badthing for the country.   But during the four years since that election, the situation hasnot improved and more and more people are feeling they are a partof that special interest.   Two former governors of South Carolina _ Robert McNair andRichard Riley _ stood with Gephardt on the Capitol steps andendorsed his candidacy.   Both felt compelled to defend the congressman against charges heis protectionist.   McNair said Gephardt has ``faced up to putting America firstwith a fair, sound and sensible trade bill. ... It is not a pieceof protectionist legislation as some have tried to portray it, butit is what is best for this country.''   ``Dick Gephardt has spoken out during this campaign on trade andsome have referred to him as a protectionist,'' said Riley. ``He'snot a protectionist at all, he's a pragmatist.''</TEXT></DOC>
