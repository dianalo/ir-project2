Perry (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><G> EXE </G><DATELINE> ATLANTA  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Michael Dukakis performed so well at the Democratic national convention that George Bush will be severely challenged to prove his own mettle at next month's Republican convention.    This convention, highlighted by Mr. Dukakis's acceptance speech, was something of a triumph, The Wall Street Journal's regular panel of political experts agrees.    &quot;With that speech,&quot; says Peter Hart, the Democratic poll taker, &quot;clearly the Democrats have taken the offensive,&quot; and Mr. Dukakis &quot;has put enormous pressure on George Bush and the Republicans.&quot;    &quot;Dukakis did almost everything right at this convention,&quot; says Alan Baron, a Democratic analyst.    The panel's two Republicans -- Kevin Phillips, the theoretician, and John Sears, one-time campaign manager for Ronald Reagan -- agree, but with some caveats. &quot;They (the Democrats) did reasonably well coming out of this convention,&quot; says Mr. Phillips. Adds Mr. Sears: &quot;I think Dukakis did the best job he could.&quot;    The analysts expect post-convention polls will give Mr. Dukakis a comfortable lead over Mr. Bush. But Mr. Baron warns that such a margin, whatever it turns out to be, will represent Mr. Dukakis's high-water mark.    The four political sages met with The Wall Street Journal the morning after the convention to analyze the week in Atlanta and to look ahead to the GOP gathering in New Orleans and into the general election.    The pressure, they now agree, is on Mr. Bush to demonstrate he isn't the sort of mindless aristocrat speakers at this convention said he is.    &quot;It's still all in Bush's hands,&quot; says Mr. Sears. &quot;But he'll lose the election if he goes on the way he has.&quot;    &quot;He's a nice person,&quot; says Mr. Phillips, the other Republican analyst, &quot;but he hasn't displayed leadership that goes with this nice personality.&quot;    Messrs. Sears and Phillips agree that expectations about Mr. Bush are now so perilously low that they're almost a plus. &quot;If he does improve, and begin to show some vision, he has a chance,&quot; says Mr. Sears.    &quot;If he were to make a terrific impression at the (Republican) convention, and do well in the debates that follow, he might profit from underexpectations,&quot; says Mr. Phillips.    The Democrats are less charitable about the vice president.    &quot;Voters have the impression that he's silly and foolish,&quot; says Mr. Baron. &quot;Bush needs to be respected. People won't elect someone they don't respect.&quot;    Says Mr. Hart: &quot;George Bush needs a re-evaluation from the American public. What they see now is not enough to get him elected.&quot; He will have two opportunities to earn a re-evaluation -- in his acceptance speech and in the debates with Mr. Dukakis. &quot;This puts a great deal of pressure on him,&quot; says Mr. Hart.    The panelists agree, with varying degrees of enthusiasm, that Mr. Dukakis's choice of Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen as his running mate was a sensible, if conventional, one. &quot;It makes the Republicans think what they ought to do,&quot; says Mr. Sears. (Mr. Baron, in particular, liked the selection, because in a session with the Journal last month he recommended that Gov. Dukakis pick the Texan.)    The Bentsen decision -- going for a mature, moderate Southerner -- means Mr. Bush's decision for a vice presidential candidate will be tougher, and more crucial.    &quot;He needs to make a decision of presidential caliber,&quot; says Mr. Baron, a sentiment all the sages accept. Choosing California Gov. George Deukmejian wouldn't qualify on that score, the panelists agree, because it would be too obviously a calculated move to carry California.    &quot;My recommendation,&quot; says Mr. Baron, &quot;is Bob Dole,&quot; the Kansas Republican who ran such a chaotic campaign against Mr. Bush in the primaries. Mr. Sears says Mr. Bush should come up with a surprise choice, perhaps even a Northeasterner, but he has no names. Mr. Phillips goes along with Mr. Dole. Mr. Hart says Mr. Bush might consider a Southerner -- Howard Baker, for example; but the best bet would be Rep. Jack Kemp of New York, who, in contrast to the GOP image, &quot;can campaign in the barrios&quot; as well as the boardrooms.    The Republican pundits, acknowledging that Mr. Dukakis has the edge for the moment, see problems looming for the Democrats that in the end could turn the election around. First of all, says Mr. Phillips, people who tuned in to watch the convention &quot;probably saw a little too much of Jesse Jackson, Teddy Kennedy and Jimmy Carter.&quot;    In Mr. Jackson, says Mr. Phillips, the Democrats have a powerful force that is more radical than people like. Adds Mr. Sears: &quot;And nothing's been solved. It could come apart in the middle of the campaign.&quot;    Mr. Hart, the poll taker, concedes the Democrats would be in trouble if Mr. Dukakis had to deal once again with an unhappy Mr. Jackson. But Mr. Baron says Mr. Jackson won't cause any trouble because &quot;he doesn't want to be blamed for a Democratic defeat.&quot;    The Republicans also argue that Mr. Dukakis failed in his acceptance speech to spell out his vision for the country or where he would take it as president.    &quot;If you read that (acceptance) speech two weeks from now,&quot; says Mr. Phillips, &quot;you would agree it is effective rhetorically but you would also agree it doesn't tell you what kind of president he would be.&quot;    &quot;He set out general goals,&quot; says Mr. Sears. &quot;You can't get very specific in the Democratic Party, or you create divisions. This was simply a case of Dukakis saying, 'I'm a competent alternative and the other guy (Mr. Bush) isn't.'&quot;    On this point, the Democratic panelists vigorously disagree.    &quot;Dukakis was challenged to reveal something new about himself, as a way of offering reassurance to the voters,&quot; says Mr. Hart. &quot;He did it and he did it unbelievably well, giving us insights we had never seen before.&quot; There was &quot;poetry&quot; in the speech, says Mr. Hart. Mr. Dukakis offered &quot;a covenant&quot; to the American people.    &quot;The speech outlined exactly who Michael Dukakis is,&quot; says Mr. Baron. He came across as &quot;a moralist, a man with traditional Yankee values. John Adams could have given that speech.&quot;    Missing from the speech, the two Democrats concede, was a convincing exposition of Mr. Dukakis's positions on foreign policy and national defense, the areas where the Massachusetts governor is least experienced. It provides a possible opening for Mr. Bush, the four experts agree.    What the Democrats did best, everyone concurs, is play down their ties to liberal, sometimes radical special-interest groups. &quot;They shed their special-interest habit,&quot; says Mr. Phillips, &quot;even if you didn't quite get the sense you were watching a Kiwanis convention.&quot;    &quot;It was so restrained, so disciplined,&quot; says Mr. Hart.    &quot;It didn't have a lot of weirdos,&quot; Mr. Phillips concedes. </TEXT></DOC>
