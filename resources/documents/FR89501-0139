Currently there are no plans to change any ofthe structures or operating characteristics associated with the reactorduring the renewal period requested by the licensee. The increase in powerlevel will not require any additional equipment.<ITAG tagnum="84">Need for the Proposed Action</ITAG>The operating license for the facility was due to expire in December 1986.The proposed action is requried to authorize continued operation so thatthe facility can continue to be used in the licensee's mission of research.<ITAG tagnum="84">Alternatives to the Proposed Action</ITAG>An alternative to the proposed action that was considered was not renewingthe operating license. This alternative would have led to cessation ofoperations, with a resulting change in status and a likely small impacton the environment. The other alternative was to renew the license withoutauthorizing the increase in power level. This alternative would have ledto a nearly identical impact on the environment as the proposed action.<ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Impact</ITAG>The DTRR operates in an existing shielded pool of water inside an existingmultiple-purpose building, so this licensing action would lead to no changein the physical environment.Based on the review of the specific facility operating characteristicsthat are considered for potential impact on the environment, as set forthin the staff's Safety Evaluation Report (SER)\1\<NOTE/> for this action, it is concluded that renewal of this facilityoperating license at an increased power level will have an insignificantenvironmental impact. Although judged insignificant, operating featureswith the greatest potential environmental impact are summarized below.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ NUREG-12312, ``Safety Evaluation Report Related to theRenewal of the Facility Operating License for the Research Reactor at theDow Chemical Company.Argon-41, a product from neutron irradiation of air during operation, isthe principal airborne radioactive effluent from the DTRR during routineoperations. Conservative calculations by the staff, based on the totalamount of Ar-41 released from the reactor during a year, predict a maximumpotential annual whole body dose of less than 1 millirem in unrestrictedareas. Radiation exposure rates measured outside of the reactor facilitybuilding are consistent with this computation.The staff has considered hypothetical credible accidents at the DTRR andhas concluded that there is reasonable assurance that such accidents willnot release a significant quantity of fission products from the fuel claddingand, therefore, will not cause significant radiological hazard to the environmentor the public.This conclusion is based on the following:(a) The excess reactivity available under the technical specificationsis insufficient to support a reactor transient generating enough energyto cause overheating of the fuel or loss of integrity of the cladding,(b) At a thermal power level of 300 kilowatts, the inventory of fissionproducts in the fuel cannot generate sufficient radioactive decay heatto cause fuel damage even in the hypothetical event of instantaneous totalloss of collant, and(c) The hypothetical loss of integrity of the cladding of the maximum irradiatedfuel rod will not lead to radiation exposures in the unrestricted environmentthat exceed guideline values of 10 CFR Part 20.In addition to the analyses in the SER summarized above, the environmentalimpact associated with operation of research reactors has been genericallyevaluated by the staff and is discussed in the attached generic evaluation.This evaluation concludes that there will be no significant environmentalimpact associated with the operation of research reactors licensed to operateat power levels up to and including 2 MW(t) and that an Environmental ImpactStatement is not required for the issuance of construction permits or operatinglicenses for such facilities. We have determined that this generic evaluationis applicable to operation of the DTRR and that there are no special orunique features that would preclude reliance on the generic evaluation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Alternative Use of Resources</ITAG>This action does not involve the use of any resources beyond those normallyallocated for such activities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Agencies and Persons Consulted</ITAG>The staff has obtained the technical assistance of the Idaho National EngineeringLaboratory in performing the safety evaluation of continued operation ofthe DTRR facility.<ITAG tagnum="84">Finding of No Significant Impact</ITAG>Based upon foregoing environmental assessment, the Commission has concludedthat the proposed action will not have a significant effect on the qualityof the human environment. Accordingly, the Commission has determined notto prepare an envionrmental impact statement for this proposed action.For further details with respect to this action, see the licensee's requestfor a license amendment dated November 14, 1986, as supplemented on June2, 1987, August 14, 1987, April 29, 1988, and January 10, 1989.
