The allegation was contained in a plea agreement involving David Janasik, a former Goodyear employee.    The department said Mr. Janasik was the conduit for the bribes. No charges were filed against Goodyear, according to a department spokesman. The department said Mr. Janasik agreed to plead guilty to one count of filing a false tax return. The department said he failed to report $75,000 in income that he received from the bribery scheme.    Officials for the department wouldn't provide any details of the alleged illegal bribery scheme. Mr. Janasik couldn't be reached for comment.    Goodyear said it uncovered the scheme in 1985 and told the Justice Department about it. A spokesman for the Akron, Ohio, tire company said there had been a federal grand jury in Cleveland looking into the matter. &quot;We had been cooperating with the grand jury, but we last heard from them in April 1987,&quot; the spokesman added. </TEXT></DOC>
