(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Taxi drivers in this Atlanta suburb aremore wary about who they pick up, and some have stopped driving atnight since the slayings of four cabbies have sparked fears of aserial killer.   Three of the four drivers shot to death since April 1 worked forthe Day andamp; Night Cab Co., including 30-year-old Steve Trammell, whowas buried Wednesday. Some night shift drivers have stayed home thisweek because they are afraid, said company manager Willard R. Dunson.   ``They'll be back,'' he said. ``They just wanted to take a fewdays off to think about things.''   One cabbie who is still driving, Donald Simmons, said he is morecareful about who rides in his taxi, but he added that the job hasalways had an element of danger.   ``It is a very dangerous profession,'' said Joseph Hall, directorof the Atlanta Bureau of Taxicabs and Vehicles for Hire. ``You'repicking up a complete stranger. You're taking him wherever he wantsto go, and he's behind you. You're at a disadvantage.''   Russell O'Neal, a Day andamp; Night driver who said he was Trammell'sbest friend, said he now refuses any customer who doesn't come outof the residence to which he has been summoned.   Trammell's body was found Sunday in a creek about 250 yards fromhis cab, which still had its lights on and engine running. Policesaid he was beaten and shot twice, apparently after being forced outof his taxi.   The other three were slain in similar fashion, their bodies foundin the nearby suburb of East Point, College Park and inside Atlantacity limits, near College Park.   College Park police Detective Robert Jacks said authoritieshaven't established for certain that one person is behind thecrimes. But he said they haven't ruled out that possibility either.   ``Contrary to what people think, we don't really know if we'vegot a serial killer,'' Jacks said. ``It could be a coincidence.There are a whole lot of loose ends in this case.''   Atlanta police Detective C.R. Price agreed, but added that theserial killer theory is viable.   ``We have reason to believe that because they (the slayings) alloccurred among cabbies working the south side,'' he said.   Jacks said no physical evidence has been found so far to link thekillings, except that all the victims were cabbies, all worked inthe same area and robbery did not appear to be the sole motive.   ``Some of the victims still had money on them, but of course youdon't know how much they had to begin with,'' Jacks said. ``There'snot enough evidence to say they were all robberies.''   The Georgia Bureau of Investigation was brought into the casethis week to lend its expertise and crime laboratory to the threepolice departments working on the killings, said spokesman JohnBankhead.   Jacks said Trammell's taxi was being examined at the lab thisweek for possible clues, such as hair and other fibers.   Hall said 16 cab drivers in the city have died violently since1980. That includes one of the four recent victims; the others werefound just outside the city limits.</TEXT></DOC>
