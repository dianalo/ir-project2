In meetings and appearances throughout the day, Tutu repeatedhis message that the longstanding U.S. policy of diplomaticpressure has failed. He urged lawmakers to support a new bill thatwould sever virtually all economic ties between the two countries.   ``It is critically urgent that you make a moral decision,'' Tututold a Capitol Hill audience that included about a dozen Housemembers. ``Are you on the side of injustice or justice? The side ofoppression or freedom? Of inhumanity or humanity?''   A bill that would require U.S. companies to shed theirinvestments in South Africa within a year and ban trade ineverything but strategic minerals and agricultural products ispending in the House, and a similar bill was to be introduced inthe Senate Thursday by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and others.   While supporters are optimistic about House passage, the bill'sfate is unclear in the Senate, in part because moderate Republicanswho were key to the passage of limited sanctions in 1986 arereluctant to go along with harsher measures.   As Tutu sought support for the legislation, a congressionalstudy was issued showing that South Africa's exports to 24countries which report trading data to the International MonetaryFund decreased by 7 percent and imports plummeted by 31 percentfrom 1982 through the first half of 1987. The declines came whileoverall trade was rising substantially.   The interim report by the General Accounting Office did not sayhow much of the decline was due to the limited sanctions imposed byCongress in 1986 over President Reagan's veto. Those sanctionsbanned imports of agricultural products, coal, iron, steel andtextiles, and exports of oil, arms, nuclear materials andcomputers, as well as new U.S. loans.   The report also noted that U.S. direct investment in SouthAfrica declined by about 10 percent since 1982.   About 80 percent of South Africa's trade remains with six majorindustrial nations: the United States, Great Britain, West Germany,France, Italy and Japan. The United States and Great Britainrecently have decreased their share of trade, while Japan hasincreased its share, the GAO found.   Tutu said the South African government remains intransigent,exercising what amounts to terrorism over its black majoritydespite the earlier sanctions by the United States. And hesuggested that world attention to the problem has waned.   ``I want to know what the South African government still has todo so the world would be filled with so much revulsion and outragethat it would move heaven and earth to rid the world of the scourgeof apartheid,'' the Anglican archbishop said, comparing thegovernment to that of Nazi Germany.   ``It sometimes takes our breath away, the things that the SouthAfrican government has been able to get away with,'' he said.   Tutu contended that ``anything that has happened in South Africahas happened because of pressure.''   He specifically cited the continued detention by the governmentof children as young as 7 and 8 years old, with some held more thana year and kept without contact from the outside.   ``What must our people still suffer so that the world,recognizing their anguish, would then say we can't allow this tocontinue?'' Tutu asked.   Rep. Steve Gunderson, R-Wis., who supported the limitedsanctions in 1986, said he was concerned that unilateral action bythe United States might have little impact without parallel movesby other major South African trading partners like West Germany andJapan.   ``It would be far more effective if we had a global approach,''Tutu acknowledged. ``But who is likely to persuade them? No countryis in a better position that the United States. ... The moral standyou take sends out ripples.''   In a speech at the National Press Club, Tutu faulted the currentleaders of the United States, Great Britain, West Germany and Japanfor ignoring the problem. ``They have decided that South Africanblacks are expendable ... profits matter more,'' he charged.</TEXT></DOC>
