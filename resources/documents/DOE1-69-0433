Thus, suitable data filing systemand precise data compression will be necessitated. Image quality wasevaluated before and after image data compression, using local filingsystem (MediFile 1000, NEC Co.) and forty-seven modes of compressionparameter. For this study X-ray images of 10 plain radiographs and 7contrast examinations were digitized using a film reader of CCD sensorin MediFile 1000. Those images were compressed into forty-seven kindsof image data to save in an optical disc and then the compressed imageswere reconstructed. Each reconstructed image was compared with non-compressedimages in respect to several regions of our interest by four radiologists.Compression and extension of radiological images were promptly made byemploying the local filing system. Image quality was much more affectedby the ratio of data compression than by the mode of parameter itself.In another word, the higher compression ratio became, the worse the imagequality were. However, image quality was not significantly degraded untilthe compression ratio was about 15: 1 on plain radiographs and about8: 1 on contrast studies. Image compression by this technique will beadmitted by diagnostic radiology.</TEXT></DOC>
