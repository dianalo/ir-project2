Commercial-property and casualty rates track wild cycles-- some premiums quadrupled during the last peak in themid-1980s. Today, views vary on whether the cycle is about toturn up again. The financial state of the industry &quot;hasn'tgotten ugly enough to change yet,&quot; says William Cavanagh ofStandard andamp; Poor's. He says recent stock runups aid insurers'portfolios, enabling them to &quot;eat more losses.&quot; But fallinginterest rates can trim returns on bonds.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;It's still a buyer's market,&quot; says Jamie Guenther of Duffandamp; Phelps. Firms try offering more three-year contracts,sharing some risk by locking in premiums for nervous clients.Insurance broker Johnson andamp; Higgins offers a property policythat sets premiums for 10 years and puts a portion of thecost in a &quot;premium reserve,&quot; which the insured keeps ifclaims don't surpass a set level. At worst, the insuredforfeits the reserve. At best, it has stable premiums(despite any disaster) and it shares profits.   Pacific Bell was the first to buy the new Jandamp;H coverage onOct. 1, 1989 -- 10 days before the San Francisco quake.                                                                                                          LET THEM EAT less cake: '90s weddings look smaller but noless sweet.   Manhattan baker Sylvia Weinstock finds guest lists of 25to 50 more common than the big bashes of the '80s. Sherecently baked a wedding cake for seven. Ida Mae's Cakes inJacksboro, Texas, finds the mid-sized reception halved to 200or so as costs are pared. &quot;They end up with what's importantto them and scrape on everything else,&quot; says owner BeckySikes, noting the wedding cake survives as special. An IdaMae cake costs from $1.50 to $5 a slice.   Baroque confections built with columns are out; simpledesigns and fresh flowers are in, says Rose Levy Beranbaum,author of &quot;The Cake Bible.&quot; A few years ago brides took ashine to gold leaf, but not today, says New York baker GailWatson. &quot;All that decadent and wild stuff is gone,&quot; she adds.What stays is chocolate filling. And carrot cake becomes astaple of sorts. Baker Josef Bogosian says fresh fruitfilling is tops in the tony suburbs of Detroit.                                                                                                          SEWING HUMS in homes today, redesigning fabric-store salespatterns.   Thrifty do-it-yourselfers help boost first-quarter sales15% for Sherman Oaks, Calif.-based House of Fabrics. AndFabri-Centers of America in Hudson, Ohio, says businessquadrupled since it revamped the chain four years ago tofocus on fewer but bigger stores. Both chains credit homefashion for some of the gain. Gary Larkins of House ofFabrics says saving isn't all women want: &quot;They have acreative desire to decorate their homes.&quot;   Half the fabric sold today at his chain is used forprojects other than clothes, up from 20% some 15 years ago.Still, apparel cuts a big swath: Simplicity Patterns, NewYork, says sales jumped as much as 30% for some designs thisyear. The number of patterns it offers has doubled since1989. Whimsy helps, as demand grows for adult and childcostume patterns. Simplicity beams up a winner in Star-Trekuniforms, noting the Trekkies buy patterns all year.   &quot;Express patterns&quot; like the three-hour shirt and thefive-hour blazer attract many tailors, says Simplicity.                                                                                                          KNIGHT SITTERS: The New York/New Jersey Knights, WorldLeague of American Football North American Eastern Divisionchampions, offer free child care at Sunday's playoff game asthey have all season for home games (mostly Saturday nights)at Giants Stadium.                                                                                                          HAVE LOAN, will travel: Chemical Bank sends 13 salesstaffers off to visit clients in their homes and officesaround the New York/New Jersey/Connecticut area. In the firstmonth, &quot;Chemical consultants&quot; booked $40 million in newbusiness.                                                                                                          LEARN YOUR PCs: Following a survey of potential employers'wishes, MBA students at the University of Iowa this fall willfind regular first-week classes omitted in favor of timespent learning teamwork, conflict management, basic computingand information retrieval.                                                                                                          JUNIOR COLLEGES win enrollment gains as four-year-collegecosts rise.   The average age of community and junior college studentsis 29, but lately two-year schools see a jump in youngerstudents. &quot;When times are hard, our enrollment goes up,&quot; saysJames Gollattscheck, an official of the American Associationof Community and Junior Colleges. He thinks the gains may bemore lasting because of demographics and a need to updatetechnology jobs periodically.   The Chronicle of Higher Education notes big gains. Itreports Delgado Community College in Texas saw a 75% rise in18- to 24-year-olds in the three years ended in 1990, whileKansas City's Metropolitan Community Colleges had a 39% gainfrom 1986 to 1990. Others with double-digit rises wereRaymond Walters College of the University of Cincinnati,Harrisburg Area Community College in Pennsylvania and DundalkCommunity College in Maryland.   About 80% of junior college students work, so virtuallyall courses are offered in day, evening and weekend sessions.
