Kirk Jr. has decided to resign as chairmanof the Democratic National Committee, The Boston Globe reportedtoday.   Kirk believes he has accomplished the goals he set for himselfand feels ``that one term is enough,'' according to a source thatthe newspaper did not identify.   The Globe said Kirk would announce his decision at a newsconference today in Washington.   Other sources close to Kirk told the newspaper he based hisdecision solely on personal concerns. The newspaper said it waswidely known that his wife, Gail, preferred that he step down.   Kirk, who took over head of the party after the 1984 presidentialelection, turned down several requests from leading Democrats thathe remain on the job, the newspaper said.   Leading candidates to replace Kirk are believed to include RickWiener, chairman of the Michigan Democratic Party, and Ronald H.Brown, who worked briefly in the presidential campaigns of the Rev.Jesse Jackson and Gov. Michael S. Dukakis.   Also expected to seek the post are former congressmen MichaelBarnes of Maryland, James Jones of Oklahoma and Jim Stanton of Ohio.</TEXT></DOC>
