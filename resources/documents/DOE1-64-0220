However, through proper assumptions, the highfrequency gain of the Maximum A Posteriori restoration filter can beset to one. This filter will then essentially preserve the uncorrelatedappearance of the Poisson noise in nuclear medicine images, while increasingimage contrast by restoring the low-frequency content of the image. Sincethe Poisson noise can be used to judge the data's statistical reliability,preserving it may aid the image interpreter.</TEXT></DOC>
