Customers at both institutions will have access to their funds today.    Boone County Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, Centralia, Mo., became a branch of United Savings andamp; Loan Association of Lebanon, Mo., which acquired the troubled thrift's $20 million in assets. The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. contributed $2.4 million to United Savings to facilitate the merger.    Boone County became the 39th failing thrift to be closed or merged by the FSLIC in 1987, but the first in Missouri.    Also, directors of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. approved the transfer of insured deposits and fully secured or preferred deposits of the First State Bank at Shoshoni, Wyo., to First State Bank of Thermopolis, Wyo.    The FDIC was named receiver of the First State Bank at Shoshoni, which closed Friday with assets of $5.1 million.    The board arranged a deposits transfer because it didn't get any bids to purchase the bank. When the bank closed, deposits totaled $4.1 million in 776 accounts. Administration of the transferred insured deposits will be funded by an equivalent cash payment from the FDIC. The acquiring bank will pay the FDIC premium of $5,000 for the right to receive the transferred deposits.    The closing marked the 184th bank failure nationwide in 1987, and the fourth in Wyoming. </TEXT></DOC>
