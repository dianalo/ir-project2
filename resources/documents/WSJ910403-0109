A study of 1,749 workers at Goodyear Tire andamp; Rubber Co.'splant in Niagara Falls, N.Y., found that workers exposeddirectly to ortho-toluidine and aniline -- chemicals used inmaking dyes, rubber, pharmaceuticals and pesticides -- were6.5 times more likely than the average state resident todevelop bladder cancer.</LP><TEXT>   While researchers in the past decade have demonstratedthat the chemicals cause cancer in lab animals, the study isthe first to show a definitive link between the chemicals andworkers when no other known carcinogens were present. Thestudy found that workers' cancer risk increased with theirproximity to the chemicals and the duration of theirexposure. The chemicals can be aborbed by inhaling or skincontact, and can cause tumors on the bladder 20 years or moreafter exposure.   The study, by researchers at the Cincinnati-based NationalInstitute for Occupational Safety and Health, a unit of theDepartment of Health and Human Services, also found thatworkers exposed to the chemicals for over 10 years were 27.2times more likely to get the disease. The results appeartoday in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.   The study focused on Goodyear's plant after the Oil,Chemical, and Atomic Workers union requested aninvestigation, but the phenomenon is not limited to theAkron-based tire concern. A NIOSH survey estimates some 2,300facilities use the chemicals, and 28,483 workers have beenexposed to ortho-toluidine and 35,881 have been in contactwith aniline.   &quot;The chain of evidence here is fairly strong that anincrease in bladder cancer is associated with exposure toortho-toluidine and aniline,&quot; said Elizabeth Ward, the chiefresearcher. &quot;We're saying exposure should be reduced to thelowest feasible concentration.&quot;   In connection with the new findings, NIOSH is sending a&quot;hazard alert&quot; to over 200 companies, including Du Pont Co.,Eastman Kodak Co., Aristech Chemical Corp., Uniroyal ChemicalCo., First Chemical Corp., ICI Americas Inc., Mobay Corp. andMitsui andamp; Co. USA.   Steve Wodka, a lawyer for the Oil, Chemical and AtomicWorkers, hailed the study. He said that there will beliability cases at the Goodyear site for the next 20 years,and that other plants that make or use the chemicals withoutadequate controls and warnings could also be vulnerable toliability claims. He said the union has settled nine of 11bladder cancer claims against Goodyear, and has two morecurrently in court.   A Goodyear spokesman said the company had already beenwithin federal guidlines, but added: &quot;Goodyear has begun toimplement recommendations of NIOSH to further minimize workerexposure to ortho-toluidine and aniline,&quot; including moreengineering controls, training and protective equipment.However, the spokesman said the chemicals are &quot;essential&quot; inthe tire-making process and would not be discontinued.</TEXT></DOC>
