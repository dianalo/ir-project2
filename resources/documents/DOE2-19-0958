It is concludedthat additional integral experiments should be performed with these materials.The method of measuring neutron leakage from spherical assemblies ('borontank' method) is described in brief. The authors give the results ofmeasurement by this method of neutron leakage from /sup 238/U, /sup 232/Thand Be spherical assemblies of differnt thickness with normalizationto one source neutron. They compare the experimental results with calculationby the BLANK program using the ENDL and UKNDL library data. The comparisonshows that the values of leakage for /sup 238/U and Be spheres and, inthe case of small thicknesses, for /sup 232/Th are reproduced satisfactorilyby calculation. In the case of the thorium sphere with a 10 cm thicknessof the multiplication zone, the calculated neutron leakage is 7% lowerthan the experimental value.</TEXT></DOC>
