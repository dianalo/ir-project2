Barthen Gorman, Mobile ServicesDivision, Common Carrier Bureau; Telephone: 202-632-6450.<ITAG tagnum="84">ORDER</ITAG>Adopted: April 7, 1988; Released: April 27, 1988.By the Commission.1. The common carrier, broadcast, and private radio services are each governedby specific Commission Rules which explain who may sign applications seekingFCC authorization in those services. The relevant rule sections are andSection;1.743 for common carrier, andSection; 73.3513 for broadcast, and andSection;1.913 for private radio. The language of the above rule sections (henceforth,the signature rules) is nearly identical except for the language of subsection(b) of each rule. Subsections (b) are similar in that they allow an attorneyto sign an application, or amendment thereto, for an applicant if the applicantis physically disabled. The subsections differ in that an attorney fora broadcast or private radio applicant may sign an application for hisclient if the applicant is absent from the United States, whereas the attorneyfor a common carrier applicant may sign for the applicant only if the applicantdoes not reside in the contiguous 48 States of the United States or theDistrict of Columbia. <T3>Compare </T3>andSection; 73.3513(b) (broadcast) and andSection; 1.913(b)(private radio) with andSection; 1.743(b) (common carrier).2. We do not perceive any reason for the foregoing inconsistency in ourRules. Moreover, this inconsistency in the signature rules has apparentlyconfused some common carrier applicants, who have allowed their attorneysto sign their applications, or amendments thereto, for them when they wereabsent from the United States. Such an action is clearly authorized inthe broadcast and private radio services, but is not allowed in the commoncarrier services. The confusion generated by the current inconsistencyin the signature rules has resulted in litigation and has generally delayedthe provision of service to the public. In view of these considerations,we have decided to revise andSection; 1.743(b) of the Rules to provide thatattorneys may sign applications, amendments thereto and related statementsof fact for common carrier applicants when those applicants are absentfrom the United States. This revision will bring andSection; 1.743(b) ofthe Rules, which governs the signing of common carrier applications, intoconformity with andSection;andSection; 73.3513(b) and 1.913(b) of the Rules,which govern the signing of broadcast and private radio applications, respectively.We believe these rules are consistent with section 308(b) of the CommunicationsAct of 1934, as amended. In addition, this revision will avoid the delaysencountered over signature problems under the current version of andSection;1.743(b) and thus further the Commission's goal of providing service tothe public in the most efficient, expeditious manner possible. 3. Authority for this revision of our Rules and Regulations is containedin sections 4(i) and (j) and 303(r) of the Communications Act of 1934,as amended, 47 U.S.C. andSection; 154(i) and (j) and 303(r). Because thisrevision relates to a matter of procedure, the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553are not applicable. 4. Accordingly, it is ordered, that on the date that this Order is publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, andSection; 1.743(b) of the Commission's Rulesand Regulations is revised as set forth below.<ITAG tagnum="20">Federal Communications Commission. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">H.
