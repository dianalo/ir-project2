Jim Walter shares soared well above the proposed price on the Big Board yesterday after the announcement of the bid, which delayed the opening of trading. The stock closed at $58, up $12.50, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. With 3,951,600 shares changing hands, it was the exchange's third-most active issue.    &quot;KKR typically doesn't close at its opening bid,&quot; said John Stanley, an analyst for Wertheim Schroder andamp; Co. in New York. &quot;I think $58 (a share) is feasible.&quot;    A outside spokesman for Kohlberg Kravis declined to comment on the market's feverish response to the proposal.    Jim Walter, a home builder and building-materials supplier, disclosed the &quot;friendly&quot; bid and said it appointed a committee composed of the 10 outside directors of its 15-member board to consider the bid.    The proposal from the New York investment banking firm came as little surprise to Wall Street analysts who regarded Jim Walter, a Tampa, Fla.-based concern, as a likely target for a leveraged buyout, saying that it has a strong cash flow and that its shares have been undervalued.    In an interview, Henry Kravis, managing general partner of Kohlberg Kravis, said, &quot;We've been working with the company and management for six months, and this is not a hostile, unfriendly or unwanted offer, although we did contact them first.&quot; He added: &quot;All top management will be offered an opportunity to be included in the group.&quot;    A spokesman for Jim Walter noted that James W. Walter, its chairman, received a telephone call Wednesday afternoon from Henry Kravis, saying a letter detailing the bid would be forthcoming yesterday.    Mr. Stanley of Wertheim pointed out that Mr. Walter, who is 64 years old and holds about 532,000 of the 40,556,000 shares outstanding, assuming conversions, &quot;is getting on in years and has not been that active,&quot; and added that Joe Cordell, president and chief executive officer, who is 59, &quot;is probably also thinking about retiring and not likely to put up a stiff resistance to a buyout.&quot;    The spokesman for Jim Walter said, &quot;Our policy has always been that if an offer comes in, the board of directors feels its responsibility is to review the merits of the offer and make a judgment about the value to shareholders.&quot;    The spokesman added that Jim Walter expects to retain investment bankers promptly to review the bid, and that a board meeting is expected &quot;within days.&quot;    Robert E. Christopher III, formerly an analyst with Blackstock andamp; Co. in Jacksonville, Fla., and now an independent analyst, was particularly sanguine about how much the company might fetch. &quot;My instinct tells me the bidding could go as high as $60 (a share),&quot; said Mr. Christopher, who published a buy recommendation for the stock June 8.    Mr. Kravis said Kohlberg Kravis is represented by First Boston Corp. and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in the proposed merger. He said financing has been lined up with Drexel, Bankers Trust Co. and Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.    Kohlberg Kravis intends to acquire Jim Walter through a new company to be formed by an investor group to be organized by the firm, Jim Walter said. The firm told Jim Walter that the buyout is contingent on, among other things, a definitive merger agreement.    In a leveraged buyout, investors acquire a company largely with debt that ultimately is paid with funds generated by the acquired concern.    Neither Jim Walter nor Kohlberg Kravis would release the letter detailing the proposal, but Jim Walter said the bid calls for it to redeem its two issues of preferred stock -- the $1.60 cumulative convertible voting fourth preferred and the 5% cumulative preferred stock.    Following the announcement of the proposal yesterday, Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. said it was placing on its CreditWatch with negative implications about $700 million of Jim Walter debt and preferred stock. The issues are single-A-minus senior debt and preferred and triple-B-plus subordinated debt.    In the nine months ended May 31, Jim Walter earned $112.6 million, or $3.47 a share, on revenue of $1.72 billion.    In an interview, Mr. Walter, the founder, said he was first approached by Mr. Kravis about six months ago. &quot;Henry and one of his associates came and chatted. We had a dialogue, but then talks terminated and there was no offer.&quot; Three months ago, he said, Mr. Kravis voiced renewed interest, &quot;but it was terminated again -- everyone very friendly, no animosity.&quot; Then, on Wednesday, he said, Mr. Kravis called again and said the firm would like to make a bid, &quot;but he said only if our board wanted to consider it.&quot;    Asked whether he would like to be part of the buyout group, Mr. Walter said, &quot;I would think I would, but I'd like to see what it is first.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
