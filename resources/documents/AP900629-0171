Moore denied a suggestion by Barry's lawyer that she trapped themayor in the sting operation or that her motive for working withthe FBI was because Barry had abandoned her for another woman.   Moore broke the FBI's instructions and tried to persuade themayor to use drugs, she admitted under a second day of questioningby defense attorney R. Kenneth Mundy.   Midway through the FBI videotape of the sting operation, Mooreasks the mayor if he wants to use drugs.   ``No, not tonight,'' Barry replies on the tape. But Moore bringsthe subject back to drugs repeatedly after that.   ``You felt you were going beyond your mandate not to persuade,influence, coerce or beguile'' Barry into using drugs? asked Mundy.   ``I did,'' said Moore.   ``Why did you do that?'' asked Mundy.   Moore said she got ``overcarried'' in performing her duties forthe FBI that night.   ``In your zeal to get Mr. Barry,'' Mundy said accusingly. ``Forall you knew, he had been off drugs since May'' 1989 when Moorewent to California.   ``Not in my zeal,'' insisted Moore. ``I was not out to get Mr.Barry.''   ``What was your intent?'' asked Mundy.   ``Working this operation'' with the FBI, replied Moore.   Mundy suggested Moore had been badly treated by the mayor.   Was she angry at Mr. Barry because he didn't return her callsthroughout an eight-month span in 1989, Mundy asked. No, Moore said.   Was she angry because the mayor was involved with another woman,Maria McCarthy, or because Barry had slapped Moore when they brokeup their romantic relationship? asked Mundy.   No, she wasn't, Moore insisted each time.   On the videotape, Barry tells Moore at one point that ``Maria''is interested in having sex with the mayor.   Walking up to the witness stand, Mundy stood next to the formermodel and showed her a segment of the transcript of the recordedconversation during the Vista sting.   The former model inexplicably shouts ``Oh, Maria, Maria,'' justbefore FBI agents and police detective crash into Moore's hotelroom to arrest Barry for cocaine possession.   ``If there was no vengeance on your mind'' why would Moore saysuch a thing? inquired Mundy.   ``I have no idea,'' responded Moore, suggesting it was ``Out ofnervousness.''   Had Moore been scorned? a reporter asked Mundy after the day'scourt session.   Mundy agreed immediately and quoted the old proverb: ``Hell hathno fury like a woman scorned.''   Moore insisted that Barry repeatedly used code language aboutdrugs in carrying on their conversation. And she said he acted onhis own in buying crack cocaine from an undercover FBI agent andsmoking it.   ``He was comfortable, he was being himself'' during the visit,she said.   Moore, the government's star witness in Barry's drug and perjurytrial, testified previously that she and the mayor used drugstogether ``over 100 times'' and had an intimate relationship fromshortly after their 1986 meeting until mid-1988.   The jury spent much of Thursday watching a videotape showingBarry arriving at Moore's hotel room last Jan. 18, eventuallysmoking the drug and being arrested.   Mundy is pursuing an entrapment defense, contending the mayorwas illegally lured to the downtown Washington hotel room thatex-model Moore was staying in as part of her cooperation withfederal authorities.   Barry, 54, has pleaded innocent to 10 misdemeanor cocainepossession charges, one misdemeanor cocaine conspiracy charge, andthree felony counts of lying to a grand jury about drug use. One ofthe possession charges stems from his arrest in the sting operationat the Vista Hotel.   During the day, U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jacksonbarred the Rev. George Augustus Stallings from attending the trial.Stallings, a Barry supporter, broke with the Vatican by startinghis own African-American Catholic church, saying Rome has not beenserving the needs of black Catholics.   Mundy and the American Civil Liberties Union asked the U.S.Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to overturnJackson's exclusion of Stallings and his Thursday order turningaway Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan.   Jackson said the presence of Stallings or Farrakhan could bedisruptive.</TEXT></DOC>
