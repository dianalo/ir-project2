<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-63-0715 </DOCNO><TEXT>The kinetic basis for trans-effects of intravesicular substrates on theuptake of the organic cation, tetraethylammonium (TEA), into rabbit renalbrush-border membrane vesicles (BBMV) was studied. Preloading BBMV with1, 2, or 4 mM TEA stimulated the initial rate of uptake and the totalnet accumulation of 0.1 mM [{sup 3}H]TEA. The stimulatory effect of intravesicularTEA on the initial rate of uptake was a saturable function of the trans-TEAconcentration, with a half-maximal effect noted at an intravesicularconcentration of 0.28 mM. A 1 mM trans-concentration of TEA increasedthe Jmax of [{sup 3}H]TEA uptake (from 4.3 to 6.8 nmol.mg-1.min-1) withoutaffecting the apparent Kt. An outwardly directed H+ gradient also increasedJmax (to 10.7 nmol.mg-1.min-1), although the addition of an outwardlydirected TEA gradient did not produce further increases in the rate ofTEA uptake. External H+ acted as a competitive inhibitor of TEA uptake,and an increase in external [H+] (from 32 nM to 100 nM) produced an increasein the apparent Kt for TEA transport (from 0.12 to 0.26 mM) without affectingthe Jmax. The results suggested that TEA and H+ compete for a commonsite or set of mutually exclusive sites on the cytoplasmic and luminalaspects of TEA/H+ exchanger in the renal brush border, and that thesesites have a similar affinity for TEA.</TEXT></DOC>
