(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A Richmond man accused of using acomputer bulletin board to ask about acquiring young boys for apornographic ``snuff'' film pleaded guilty Wednesday to conspiracyto kidnap and soliciting to produce child pornography.   The defendant, Dean A. Lambey, faces a maximum penalty of lifeimprisonment plus 10 years and $500,000 in fines for both charges.   Lambey, 34, and Daniel T. Depew, 28, of Alexandria, were chargedin U.S. District Court in August following a six-month undercoverpolice operation that began, according to court documents, whenLambey contacted an undercover police officer in San Jose, Calif.,through a computer bulletin board system and asked about young boysfor a pornographic ``snuff'' film.   A ``snuff'' film is one in which someone is actually killed.   In March, Lambey suggested that he and the undercover officersproduce their own child pornography film, buying a child for$12,000 from an out-of-state source, according to an account of thecase given The Associated Press in August by an official whoinsisted on anonymity.   More than 100 FBI agents and San Jose, Calif., police wereinvolved in the investigation, U.S. Attorney Henry E. Hudson saidin August, with agents keeping the suspects under surveillance 24hours a day.</TEXT></DOC>
