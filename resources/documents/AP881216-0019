The experiments in two laboratories at the University ofCalifornia, San Diego involved the use of cells that weregenetically altered and then injected or grafted into laboratoryanimals, according to reports published today.   In a study of cancer, Wen-Hwa Lee, a professor of pathology atUCSD, said a cancer-suppressing gene was inserted into the alteredgenetic pattern of a retrovirus, a type of virus that controls thegenetic pattern of a normal cell.   The retrovirus carrying the cancer-suppressing retinoblastomagene, or RB, was then transplanted into cancer cells.   To serve as a comparison, another type of gene, calledluciferase, or LUX, was processed in the same way.   Lee said both types of altered cancer cells then were injectedinto nude mice, a type of laboratory rodent that lacks an immunesystem and is highly susceptible to developing cancer. Each of sevenmice received both kinds of the altered cells, one type in each rearflank, he said.   After a month the flanks injected with the LUX-infected cellsdeveloped tumors, Lee said. No tumors, however, grew on the flanksthat had received the RB-infected cells.   It appears that the virus carrying the cancer-suppressing gene isable to prevent the formation of malignant cells, Lee said. Itsuggests that this technique could be used to genetically convertmalignant tumor cells, which grow very rapidly, to cells that grownormally, he said.   ``After the tumor cell received this virus,'' said Lee, ``thetumor cell would lose its malignancy. Therefore, it would stopgrowing, or phase into a normal cell.''   He said this holds promise for development withi five years of a``novel strategy for the treatment of malignancy.''   Lee said cells receiving the RB gene would be blocked permanentlyfrom turning into cancer and that the virus carrying the gene couldcontribute this turmor suppression to other cells.   He said the technique using the RB gene theoretically could workin treatment of breast, bone and lung cancer, and a rare type of eyecancer in children. The absence of the RB gene has been linked toall these types of cancers.   In another UCSD experiment, Theodore Friedmann, professor ofpediatrics, said he and a group of researchers grafted geneticallyaltered cells into the brains of rats to produce a special proteincalled nerve growth factor that prevented damaged brain tissue fromdying.   The work, he said, ``is the first demonstration of this sort ofcombination of genetic modification of cells and grafting as anapproach to central nervous system disease.''   Friedmann said the researchers disarmed a retrovirus by removingpart of its genetic pattern. A gene that carries instructions forthe production of nerve growth factor was then put into the patternof the retrovirus.   Next, the team put the altered retrovirus into cells calledfibroblasts. These fibroblasts now had the genetic instructions forproducing nerve growth factor.   The scientists then made surgical lesions in the brains of 16rats, cutting the connection between the forebrain and thehippocampus. Normally, this would cause the degeneration ofcholinergic cells, a type of brain tissue that requires thenourishment of nerve growth factor.   Eight of the rats received brain grafts containing fibroblastsaltered to produce nerve growth factor. The other rats receivedgrafts of unaltered fibroblasts.   After two weeks, both groups of rats were killed and autopsied.   Friedmann said the rats that received the unaltered fibroblastsexperienced a loss of 51 percent of their cholinergic cells. But therats that had received the fibroblasts carrying the nerve growthfactor gene lost only 8 percent of their cholinergic cells.   He said the importance of the study is that it demonstrates thatbrain conditions caused by a shortage of certain proteins couldperhaps be corrected by grafting genetically altered cells thatproduce this protein.   ``You would have this little factory close to the lesion which ispouring out the material in a stable, permanent way,'' Friedmannsaid.   ``The long-range implications from this study,'' he said, is that``one can start thinking about treating diseases that are a resultof gene defects in the brain at the level of the gene defect.''   Among the disorders that may one day benefit from this type oftherapy, he said, are Alzheimer's disease, some types of mentalretardation and cerebral palsy, and genetically based degenerationdiseases.   Both studies were published today in Science, the journal of theAmerican Association for the Advancement of Science.</TEXT></DOC>
