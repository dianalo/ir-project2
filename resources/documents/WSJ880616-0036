WR Lazard acquired businesses in institutional equity sales, over-the-counter stock transactions, and syndicate formation. WR Lazard also purchased Laidlaw Capital Management, which manages $690 million in pension-fund assets.    Wardell R. Lazard, chairman and chief executive officer of the three-year-old firm, put the purchase price at more than $2 million, including assumption of debt. He declined to break out the figure.    Original terms announced in May called for John D. Kuhns, who controls Kuhns Brothers andamp; Laidlaw, and other Kuhns Brothers holders to take a minority equity stake in WR Lazard. No money was to change hands under the original transaction.    Also, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. is to invest in the new firm, a transaction Mr. Lazard said he expects to close shortly. </TEXT></DOC>
