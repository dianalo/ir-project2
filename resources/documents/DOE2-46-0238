A daily loadingof 46.2 g/l (COD) of silage juice yielded biogas in amounts of 15.2 l/lof reactor volume daily (COD reduction = 78.6%). Upon a daily load of57.8 g/l of substrate biogas production make up 23.8 l/l of reactor volumedaily. Anaerobic fermentation of brown juice (3.5 days retention time)produced 13.8 l of biogas per l of reactor volume daily. The reactionof fermented juices was neutral, hence they can be used as fertilizers.</TEXT></DOC>
