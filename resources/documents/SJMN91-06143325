From Monday through Friday, she is at her desk at AdvancedMicro Devices in Sunnyvale by 8:30 a.m., where she is an electronics engineerdesigning intricate integrated circuits found in chips.;    &quot;My work gives mea great sense of achievement,&quot; she said, &quot;because I feel that the chip is theone element in the electronics industry which has done the most to advancetechnology, business, and communication. The largest chip is only a quarter ofan inch on one side and yet it is able to do so many wonderful things.&quot;;   With so many interests in her life, Woo is pushed to use her time wisely.While traveling to and from work, for instance, she spends the hour listeningto Chinese music tapes for use in a dance number.;    &quot;Music,&quot; she said, &quot;laysthe ground work to start a dance performance. It is very important because itprovides the frame and the theme for the dance.;    &quot;In doing the musicalarrangement for a lion dance, I had spent one year in my car listening to thetape, 'Celebrate For A Good Harvest,' before I felt comfortable enough torearrange the music for the dance number.&quot;;    Woo is a specialist in theChinese ribbon dance, which she started learning at age 14 in China. She notonly dances, but she teaches on weekends as well, when she's not performing.During the evening, she also works out with her dance groups twice a week.;   Woo has been responsible for introducing many forms of Chinese dancing to BayArea audiences.

During the student uprising in Beijing onJune 4, 1989, Woo found that she had pangs of anger over the treatment of thestudents who were fighting for a small amount of freedom.;    &quot;I am notpolitical,&quot; she said, &quot;but I felt that the June 4 incident in Beijing showedthe ugly side of China. I have seen the beauty of China through the performingarts with its colorful costumes, music, and history often linked to thedances.;    &quot;I have also enjoyed much freedom in this country and it made meangry to think that my fellow countrymen were denied even a small fraction ofwhat I have in this country.&quot; It was that anger that motivated her to join thePro Democracy Movement in the South Bay.;    Woo and her husband, John Chu,the owner of Nanotechnology, an electronics consulting firm in Cupertino,share their domestic responsibilities.
