Departments appeal the budget agency's proposed cuts more than ever before in the Reagan era. OMB comes under pressure to resolve more disputes before they reach the Iran-preoccupied White House; it makes concessions to Treasury, Transportation, HHS and other agencies. The budget office has won some, though; Agriculture lost big when it took its protest to the White House.    Another bloody battle could come today over the Justice Department budget. An Oval Office meeting yesterday failed to resolve all differences between Attorney General Meese and Budget Director Miller; the two are scheduled to duel again. One budget official complains that Meese's aides &quot;solve problems the old-fashioned way -- they throw money at 'em.&quot;    Asked how OMB will meet Gramm-Rudman's $108 billion deficit target, an official replies: &quot;The fires are burning; the books are cooking.&quot;    IRANIAN ARMS shipments are about to rise, U.S. analysts worry.    With the de facto collapse of the U.S. drive to stop other countries from sending weapons or equipment to Tehran, the gates may be about to open. U.S. officials say a number of countries, including Brazil, Switzerland and Argentina, appear poised to make new arms sales. A stalled sale of West German bridge-building equipment, ostensibly for civilian use, may be revived.    With fresh additional supplies of weapons from China, Israel and other nations, Iran may be able to mount a more successful offensive against Iraq sometime before next March, analysts say. The Iranians have dispatched more than 100,000 men to the front during the last few weeks but still face logistics problems and feuding between the military and revolutionary guardsmen.    DEMOCRATS DIVIDE over trade-bill strategy for the 100th Congress.    Byrd and Wright push to take advantage of Reagan's weakness by backing a tough measure similar to last year's House-passed legislation; Rostenkowski is likely to agree. But incoming Senate Finance chief Bentsen, backed by younger members like Baucus and Rockefeller, seeks what he claims is a more &quot;responsible&quot; measure designed to attract some Republican votes.    Among the proposals the Senate is considering: increased aid for workers displaced by imports and bigger penalties for violations of patents and trademark rights. The administration tacitly acknowledges that some sort of bill is all but inevitable next year. But it still hasn't decided whether to propose its own measure or merely try to influence Congress's deliberations.    Hoping to set a bipartisan tone, Bentsen took Democratic and GOP committee members to Canada to underscore U.S. interest in a free-trade pact.    WHO'S TO JUDGE? Defeated GOP Sen. Gorton expresses strong interest in a U.S. judgeship. He lost in part because he switched and voted for conservative court nominee Daniel Manion in order to get his own choice for another judicial slot; Manion won but Gorton's man was sidetracked.    WALL STREET WORRIES about possible Volcker replacements. A Drexel Burnham survey of 371 investment managers found that 19%, a plurality, consider Fed Vice Chairman Johnson the most likely replacement, but only 7% have the &quot;most confidence&quot; in him. New York Fed President Corrigan has the highest confidence rating, 26%, while 47% have &quot;least confidence in&quot; Donald Regan.    ODD COUPLE: The National Association of Business PACs negotiates with Anne Wexler -- known as a reformer in the Carter White House -- to be its lobbyist on campaign-finance law changes. The group says it wants to advocate &quot;positive&quot; changes but hasn't decided what they might be.    HEAD START? In a recent radio address, Reagan attacked the theories of British economist Keynes, calling them &quot;a legacy from a period when I was back in college studying economics.&quot; Actually, Reagan graduated almost four years before Keynes's &quot;General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money&quot; was published.    PARALYSIS AND CONFUSION grip the Home Loan Bank Board.    Chairman Gray is preoccupied with the Justice Department's criminal inquiry into his and other officials' travel expenses. Insiders say the White House hoped to push Gray to temporarily stand aside as chairman in favor of new board member Lee Henkel, but the plan has been put on hold because of the Iranian mess.    The board's monthly mortgage rate survey was nearly a week late partly because, a spokeswoman says, it was held up in the chairman's office. Meanwhile, officials at the 12 regional banks rejoice at not having to help pay for Washington officials' extravagant expenses anymore. But Gray's recent order to board officials to stay at modest hotels apparently came too late to change some plans.    Some officials attending a San Francisco bank meeting yesterday and today are staying at the ritzy Westin St. Francis.    MINOR MEMOS: A new bumper sticker appears: &quot;Release the Reagan Tapes.&quot;. . . Copies of OMB's proposed Medicare cuts, given privately to HHS officials one day at 4 p.m., turned up at the AMA convention in Las Vegas by 7 a.m. the next morning. . . . SEC public-affairs staffers sport buttons reading, &quot;I survived Ivan Boesky.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
