Greiff (WSJ Special) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> FREST CANDA JAPAN EUROP </CO><IN> MON FRX PCS CMD </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Foreign-exchange traders tested ranges for the dollar yesterday and found themselves as tightly hemmed in as they had been before Tuesday's release of U.S. trade figures for March.    The dollar finished little changed against most major currencies.    &quot;The last {February} trade number was horrendously bad, but the central banks kept {the dollar} from going anywhere. This number was tremendously good, but with the selling we saw, it couldn't go anywhere,&quot; said Fred Scala, vice president with Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. &quot;We're back in a range.&quot;    Since the release of data showing a narrowing in the U.S. trade deficit, the dollar has surrendered much of the ground gained, and has even fallen below its pretrade figure level against the yen. Traders said the lack of follow-through probably reflects the U.S. currency's continued underlying weakness.    The dollar's range against the West German currency yesterday was a high of 1.7045 marks and a low of 1.6957. Against the Japanese yen, the range was even narrower, with a high of 125 yen and a low of 124.65. The yen was especially hemmed in, one trader said, by large buy and sell orders at either end of the tight range.    Late in the day, the dollar was quoted at 1.7017 marks, up from 1.7011 Wednesday, and at 124.88 yen, down from 124.91.    In early trading in Tokyo Friday, the dollar opened at 124.85 yen.    As the dollar returned to the familiar, narrow-range trading that has routinely prevailed during the intervals between monthly releases of U.S. trade statistics, market attention returned to cross trading and high-yield currencies.    Most traders and analysts agree there is more potential for profit in the &quot;high yield&quot; currencies than in straight-dollar trading. But some believe the currencies may have crested in value now that U.S. interest rates are creeping up. One trader said there may be some short-term plays in high-yield currencies, but over the long term, they appear weaker. &quot;Which would you rather hold long term, dollars or Italian lira?&quot; the trader asked.    On New York's Commodity Exchange, current-delivery gold rose 10 cents an ounce, to $457.40, in brisk trading. The estimated volume was 4.7 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $456.60 an ounce in early trading Friday in Hong Kong.    ---                      LATE NEW YORK TRADING                       Thursday, 19, 1988   Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates.
