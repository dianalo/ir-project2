The Corporationproposes a three-year funding cycle that would be implemented over a three-yeartransition period. In order to ensure continuous coverage of all existingservice areas, a transition grant would be made to all current providers.Grants from 3 to 39 months would be made to current services providersin order to effect a smooth transition to the competitive system. The durationof grants to or contracts with current grantees or contractors would dependon the date LSC chooses to implement the competitive award system in eachparticular service area. As the competitive award system is implemented in a particular servicearea, the Corporation will issue a solicitation for applications to providelegal services in that area. All applicable selection criteria will appearin the solicitation. At a minimum, selection criteria will include caseload,specific objectives, project design, management structure, organizationalcapability, and reasonable budget. Based on the applications and the peerreview process, two or more applicants may be awarded grants or contractsto provide services within a given service area. Available funding forthat service area would be apportioned among the successful applicants.For the past five years, LSC has successfully used a peer review processto make funding recommendations to the LSC President in connection withlaw school clinic grants. In the draft regulation, LSC also proposes apeer review process to consider all applications under the competitiveaward system for grants or contracts made pursuant to section 1006(a) ofthe LSC Act. At the conclusion of the peer review process, LSC staff wouldnegotiate grtants or contracts with one or more applicants receiving thehighest summary ratings from the applicable peer review panel. The finalfunding decision would be made by the President of LSC. LSC has scheduled a public hearing at the Hyatt Regency Woodfield, RegencyBallroom, 1800 East Golf Road, Schaumburg, Illinois, on June 12-13, 1989,to receive comments on this proposal. anyone wishing to offer public commentat the hearing should contact Maureen Bozell, Corporation Secretary, at(202) 963-1839. For the reasons set out above, 45 C.F.R.
