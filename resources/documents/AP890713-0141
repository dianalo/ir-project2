SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A national group of engineers, urged by a WhiteHouse official to take a stand, called Thursday for actions tocombat overheating of the Earth without waiting for absolute proofit is happening.   The steps should include efforts to improve the cleanliness ofcoal burning, to increase use of nuclear energy and to plant moretrees, according to the report released by Ernest L. Daman,president of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.   While there are still scientific uncertainties about the``greenhouse effect,'' there is enough evidence to show that theamount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is increasing, said A.Alan Moghissi, who headed the society's risk analysis task force.   ``A prudent course of action may consist of assuming that adverseeffects may take place and that corrective actions may benecessary,'' said Moghissi of the University of Maryland-Baltimore.   The society released a position paper entitled ``Energy and theEnvironment,'' including a wide-ranging series of recommendationsfor improving energy efficiency as a means of helping theenvironment.   Daman said the decision to issue a position paper on globalchange, a controversial issue in recent years, had generated debatewithin the 116,000-member society of mechanical engineers.   However, he said White House Chief of Staff John Sununu, anengineer and a member of the society, helped spur the group toaction.   Daman said that Sununu had told him that if technical groups wantto be listened to they have to stop issuing ``general,do-good-things'' reports and instead take positions on issues.   ``We have to do that, I think Sununu is right,'' Daman said.   Some environmental groups have criticized the Bush administrationfor taking what they consider a too-cautious approach to the issueof global warming.   Bush officials have said the issue is hardly clear-cut, but areport last month by the White House advisory Council onEnvironmental Quality said the government might find it necessary toplan ``future projects considering climate change even before allthe uncertainties are known.''   The engineering society's report deals with the theory thatincreasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere could cause the climateto warm, melting polar ice caps, disrupting farming and leading toother major changes in society. Carbon dioxide allows shortwaveradiation from the sun to pass through to the earth but blocks thelong-wave radiation from earth that ordinarily travels out intospace.   Many scientists believe that this change will result in anincrease in the average temperature of the Earth, although otherssay too little is known to reach any conclusions yet.   The mechanical engineers conclude in their study that researchshould be accelerated on the greenhouse effect, including aninternational agreement on reforestation.   The group called for an international fund to help maintaintropical rain forests, plus a national effort toward planting moretrees across this country. Trees and other plants remove carbondioxide from the air.   Other proposals put forth by the engineers include:   _Incentives for improving the efficiency of coal-burning plants.   _Substantial research to develop safer nuclear reactors, based oncurrently operating reactors.   _Development of technology to improve the fuel efficiency ofautomobiles.   _Continued support for the development of renewable energysystems.   _Establishment of a central facility for receiving, evaluatingand packing spent nuclear fuel and preparing it for final disposal.   _A national effort to reprocess and recycle nuclear fuel.   _Improvement of material requirements and safety of hydrogenenergy.   _Increased research on acid rain reduction.</TEXT></DOC>
