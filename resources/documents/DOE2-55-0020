The purpose of SMITE is: (1) to standardize the Russian militarytranslations of FBIS translators; (2) to define differences in elusiveU.S. and Soviet military concepts for analysts; and (3) to provide acomputerized dictionary (terminology bank) that can be modified quicklyto accommodate new Soviet military terms and revised definitions of Sovietmilitary concepts in the light of new data. Unlike the entries of othermilitary dictionaries, definitions in SMITE are cross-referenced to relatedterms in the data base so that analysts or translators can pinpoint thenuances of similar terms.</TEXT></DOC>
