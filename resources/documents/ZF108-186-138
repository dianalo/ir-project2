 Most were incompatible, making it hardfor senior managers to get aggregate financial management information.andM;Reform 88 aimed to get rid of the incompatible, redundant and obsoletefinancial systems.andP;  It called on every major agency to develop a compatibleprimary financial system by 1988.andM;The Office of Management and Budget, General Accounting Office and TreasuryDepartment have been working with the agencies to develop and operate thesenew systems.andM;&quot;We're not doing this just for us,&quot; said Jimmie Brown, OMB financial systemspolicy branch chief.andP;  &quot;We want good, solid systems that serve the departmentsand agencies and bureaus well.&quot;andM;With the right standards in place, Brown said, the information needed by OMBand Treasury should flow naturally from the agencies' financial systems.andM;The Transportation Department, designated the lead agency, worked withseveral others to publish a standard definition for general ledger accountsin 1986.andP;  Sixteen agencies now have begun to use the Standard General Ledger;all major agencies are to have it in place by 1991.andM;The Joint Financial Management Improvement Program (JFMIP), anotherinteragency effort, published core financial system requirements in 1988.andO;The document, included in GAO's Title 2 along with the Standard GeneralLedger definition, described the minimum functions of a federal financialsystem.andM;JFMIP also is working to standardize the common data elements in financialsystems.andP;  It will develop the definitions and reporting requirements for alldata that agencies must report to Treasury and OMB.andM;However, these standards and requirements would amount to little more thangood intentions if agencies were allowed to follow them independently.andP;  Toavoid costly system building, agencies must use commercial off-the-shelfsoftware where possible.andM;In 1988, the General Services Administration established a mandatory schedulecontract for off-the-shelf financial management software that meets JFMIP andGSA requirements.andM;Under the contract, agencies can acquire technical support services as wellas licenses to use software.andP;  American Management Systems Inc. of Arlington,Va., and Computer Data Systems Inc. of Rockville, Md., are on the contractnow.andM;AMS offers the Federal Financial System (FFS).andP;  CDSI supplies the FinancialAccounting and Reporting System and the Debt Management and CollectionSystem.andM;Several other vendors including Oracle Corp., are expected to negotiate withGSA to go on the next contract.andM;So far, 24 agencies have installed off-the-shelf financial managementpackages.andP;  Thirteen agencies have primary accounting systems in place, andall major agencies are scheduled to have them by 1992.andM;&quot;Fundamentally, I think the agencies are doing rather well,&quot; OMB's Brownsaid.andP;  &quot;I don't think there ever has been this large an effort to upgradefinancial systems.&quot;andM;But Brown acknowledged some slippage, not unusual in large systems efforts.andM;Shared ResourcesandM;One problem is that smaller agencies may not have the resources to develop afinancial system, even with off-the-shelf software, Brown said.andP;  OMB hasencouraged both small and large agencies to establish cross-servicingarrangements for software and system resources instead of developing theirown systems.andM;&quot;If someone has a good solid system in place that can service another agency,then you want to do that rather than build a system,&quot; Brown said.andM;Cross-servicing arrangements have proved useful for the agencies'administrative processing.andP;  The OMB publication Management of the UnitedStates Government, 1990 reported that 48 of 82 small agencies do all theirmajor administrative processing, such as accounting, administrative payments,payroll and personnel, through such arrangements.andM;Overall, 72 of the small agencies look to cross-servicing for at least someof their administrative services.andP;  That represents a marked increase from1983, when 19 small agencies did all their major administrative processingand 34 agencies did some processing through cross-servicing.andM;In one example of cross-servicing, the Treasury Financial Management Serviceworks with its client agencies and software vendors AMS and CDSI to customizeand run standard financial systems on FMS' IBM Corp. mainframe computers.andM;FMS now is setting up a system for Treasury's in-house accounting based onthe AMS software.andP;  It will replace a 10-year-old batch accounting system on aUnisys Corp. mainframe.andM;&quot;The current system is an old chugger that may not be that efficient, but itworks,&quot; said Tom Kingery, Treasury's assistant information resourcesmanagement director.andP;  &quot;However, it does not lend itself to beinguser-friendly across the government.&quot;andM;The new system will provide accounting services for Treasury's depaartmentaloffices, considered a bureau of Treasury.andP;  Development began in January 1989,with the system scheduled to go into production by Oct. 1.andM;Treasury wants to use as much of the off-the-shelf package as possible.andM;&quot;We are not trying to rewrite the old system or do things in exactly the samemanner,&quot; Kingery said.andM;&quot;Instead of telling FMS or AMS to duplicate our current reports, we're sayinghere's the data we need, show us your standard report.andP;  If the standardreport is satisfactory, we'll go with it.&quot;andM;Kingery said Treasury will worry about improvements only after it gets a goodbasic system up and running in October.andM;The State Department's primary accounting system, known as the CentralFinancial Management System (CFMS), has been in development for severalyears.andM;&quot;We've phased implementation over a period of years, recognizing that oncewe've done the initial conversion we won't be finished with all theprior-year transactions and all the procedures that are expected of us,&quot;State Finance Systems Director Howard Renman said.andM;&quot;We originally started some people by having the system loaded within acouple of months after awarding the contract.andP;  We brought four bureaus intooperation 15 months later.andP;  Few projects go from functional requirements tooperation in 15 months, particularly large systems.&quot;andM;State first installed and demonstrated the FFS program in fall 1987 andprepared for start-up in October 1988 for the beginning of fiscal 1989.andM;&quot;We brought the four bureaus onto the system for their fiscal 1989 funds inOctober 1988,&quot; Renman said.andP;  &quot;In October 1989, we brought 11 additionalbureaus onto the system for their fiscal 1990 funds.&quot;andM;State plans to bring the balance of its 30 bureaus onto the system in October1990 for fiscal 1991 funds.andM;The Interior Department also is well on the way to putting its 10 bureaus onthe same accounting system.andP;  Four bureaus now use the FFS program: the U.S.andO;Geological Survey, Bureau of Reclamation, Fish and Wildlife Service andBureau of Mines.andM;The National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management and Bureau of IndianAffairs are scheduled to begin use on Oct. 1, with the rest to follow.andM;Interior purchased on FFS software license in September 1987, before the GSAschedule contract was awarded.andP;  Afte rsix months of acceptance tests,Interior began using the system in the Bureau of Reclamation and USGS.andM;&quot;It's almost like a kamikaze strike,&quot; said Philip McKinney, chief of the USGSOffice of System Management.andP;  &quot;You're running so fast down the stretch thatyou don't really get an opoortunity to see what you could have donedifferently along the way.&quot;andM;Great ExpectationsandM;Kingery advised potential users of off-the-shelf financial software tounderstand first how their organizations do business and what they expectfrom a financial management system.andM;They should avoid &quot;trying to create a system on the fly without knowing whatthe ultimate expectation will be,&quot; Kingery said.andP;  &quot;Now that there are coreguidelines from JFMIP, it's easier to set your sights on what your systemshould do and avoid cost overruns.&quot;andM;McKinney concurred.andM;&quot;You cannot avoid the basic analysis of your organization,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Bydoing that, you not only know what opportunities you have to implement thesystem, but also what opportunities you have to streamline your organizationand maybe eliminate inefficiencies based on old technology and ways of doingbusiness.&quot;andM;McKinney warned that if agencies do not analyze carefully how they dobusiness, they wind up trying to operate the new system the same way as theold system and are not pleased with the results.andM;OMB's Brown agreed that putting old wine in new bottles is not the best idea.andO;&quot;If you try to incorporate the way you've always done business, you end upwith a modern system that doesn't give you much more information than the oldone did.&quot;andM;It seems safer to begin with the core requirements system before adding anyfeatures.andM;&quot;The more things you build into the system that are not in the baselineproduct, the more you have a custom system, and the more retrofittingproblems you have with upgraded versions of the software,&quot; Renman said.andM;The benefits of a modem, integrated financial system appear obvious incomparison with many batch accounting systems.andM;&quot;Before, you might get the information in bits and pieces, some of itmanually,&quot; Kingery said.andP;  &quot;We're trying to cut down on the reams of paperthat an analyst has to look at to find one little item.&quot;andM;Kingery said that if the system currently in development at Treasury provessatisfactory, it will become a model for other bureaus to update theirfinancial management.andM;Development costs have run slightly more than $1 million.andP;  Kingery said heanticipates yearly operating costs will be less than that.andM;&quot;We're trying to be as lean as possible,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;If a Chevrolet will doit, we don't want a Cadillac.&quot;andM;Meanwhile, agencies with systems that began operating for fiscal 1989 now areseeing the fruits of their labor.andM;&quot;We had a better fiscal year closeout at USGS this year than we've had inrecent history, simply because of the capabilities and the flexibility of thesystem,&quot; McKinney said.andP;  &quot;We got some pats on the back from our users.andP;  Theywere pleased with the closeout.&quot;andM;Renman said State had &quot;limited functionality in our old system, including nogeneral ledger, few of the standard reports that are part of accounting andbudgeting, and no on-line access.andP;  With CFMS, we get all of that.&quot;andM;OMB's Brown expressed hope that the new systems will be flexible enough toprovide data across organizational, funding or program lines.andM;&quot;For instance, if you wanted financial information on drugs, you could get itfrom several different organizations that do work related to drugs,&quot; he said.andM;Although most agencies now are moving forward, the road is not smooth.andM;&quot;We have learning curves on off-the-shelf software -- not only us but thevendors as well,&quot; Brown said.andM;&quot;The vendors are beginning to learn about the government, and we're beginningto learn about them.andP;  I believe the vendor products will get better, andwe'll get better at installing them.&quot;andM;Current users already want improvements.andM;&quot;There are areas where we wish it were easier to include reporting,&quot; Renmansaid.andP;  &quot;Some of the reports are not as easy to produce as we would like.&quot;andM;Renman said it would be helpful for OMB and GSA to put pressure on vendors tomeet such requirements during certification of packages for the GSA schedule.andM;&quot;Once the packages are on the schedule, a lot of the government's leverage islost,&quot; he said.andM;Hard to BearandM;Some of the early users already are noticing increased loads on theirhardware.andM;&quot;The computer resource requirements are higher than before,&quot; McKinney said.andO;&quot;We're using more CPU cycles and more disk space than we did before.andM;&quot;The new system has so much data that when you're setting it up, you want tokeep everything on line.andP;  &quot;We're learning how to be more efficient andfeeling more comfortable about what data we can let go.&quot;andM;The time it takes to set up transfer standards is holding back more efficientinformation transfer to OMB and Treasury.andM;&quot;OMB hasn't yet gotten to the point of specifying the file layout and datadefinitions, but they're on their way to that with the Standard GeneralLedger,&quot; Renman said.andM;&quot;Some of the key things are being put in place, but the doesn't mean they orwe are at the level of interface specifications that a data processing personwould look for.&quot;andM;Renman does not anticipate any unusual problems in providing more financialdata to OMB and Treasury.andP;  However, he said many details still have to beworked out.andM;&quot;We're on track, but there is a big difference between someone saying thatconceptually and working out all the real-world details of data definitions,edit criteria, data integrity procedures and the like,&quot; Renman said.andM;&quot;We are providing the standard external reports to OMB and Treasury,&quot;McKinney said.andP;  &quot;We have been so busy dealing with our current requirementsthat we really haven't asked anyone at OMB or Treasury what we can give themin addition to what we're giving them already.&quot;andM;Brown concluded, &quot;We're a couple of years away from major improvement in thequality and quantity of data flowing to OMB and Treasury.andM;&quot;Upgrading the government's financial systems is a massive effort.andP;  However,if we keep to our schedules and keep our standards program intact, I think wecan do all right.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
