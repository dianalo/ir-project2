Tannenbaum (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> GE </CO><IN> ERN ELE TEL </IN><DATELINE> FAIRFIELD, Conn.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   General Electric Co. reported a 23% rise in second-quarter net income on a 3% revenue decline.    Net income was $835 million, or 93 cents a share, up from the year-earlier $679 million, or 74 cents a share, as restated to reflect an accounting change. Without the accounting change, second-quarter net income rose 16%. Revenue fell to $9.58 billion, from $9.92 billion in the year-earlier quarter.    Six-month net income fell 16% to $1.56 billion, or $1.73 a share, from the year-earlier restated $1.85 billion, or $2.03 a share. Without the accounting change, earnings would have risen 16%. Revenue fell 3% to $17.9 billion, from $18.5 billion a year earlier.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, GE closed at $44.125, up 82.5 cents.    Chairman John F. Welch Jr. said: &quot;With these results GE is well on its way to a second consecutive full year of strong double-digit increases in earnings.&quot;    The broadly diversified company said its second-quarter results &quot;were led by plastics, broadcasting and financial services,&quot; with lower overhead in &quot;virtually all&quot; businesses.    Among other results, GE said its power systems business had a modest increase in operating profit, &quot;reflecting ongoing actions to improve productivity.&quot; Aerospace operating profit, however, was about flat, on lower revenue. Operating profit from aircraft engines slightly trailed the year-earlier level as higher margins failed to offset a revenue drop that was attributable to a now-settled strike against a French partner of GE's, the company said.    Major-appliance revenue was higher because of an acquisition, GE said, but operating profit fell, reflecting pricing pressure, higher costs and start-up expenses for new products. </TEXT></DOC>
