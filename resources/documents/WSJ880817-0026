It's rumor.    While rumor has always ranked right up there with fear and greed as a prime market mover, the recent proliferation of &quot;real time&quot; news services has seen to it that rumors flash around the world faster than ever before. The professionals love the services and call them &quot;rumor wires,&quot; although facts and figures, rather than rumor, are their main fare.    &quot;If one of my stocks is up or down lots of points and the company is not saying anything, it's nice to know Rumor A exists,&quot; says John A. McConville, a securities analyst at Wertheim Schroder andamp; Co. Never mind that the rumors may be false. &quot;Traders like them mainly because they cause activity in the stocks,&quot; says John D'Angelo, who runs the over-the-counter trading desk at Baird Patrick andamp; Co.    But not all traders like them. &quot;Reporters are calling and looking for rumors,&quot; gripes Dudley Eppel, head of equity trading at Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette in New York. &quot;There's so much garbage around. For every 22 rumors they write about, one works. If you follow these monkeys, you'll lose your butt.&quot;    Big media companies are plunging into fiercely competitive real-time news publishing, which they see as a strategic part of their electronic information distribution. Dow Jones andamp; Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal, introduced Professional Investor Report (PIR) last year as a complement to -- and source for -- its Dow Jones News Service ticker. The Dow Jones ticker's longtime chief rival is Reuter Financial Report, run by Reuters Holdings PLC, which also reports rumors.    McGraw-Hill Inc.'s Standard andamp; Poor's subsidiary offers Sandamp;P MarketScope. Last September, McGraw-Hill introduced McGraw-Hill News, which runs more market rumors than its editor says he would prefer. Knight-Ridder Inc. is preparing to aggressively market its 2 1/2-year-old MoneyCenter service, its main rumor vehicle.    The rumor-rife bond market gets BondData from International Thomson Organisation's Technical Data International division, and MMS Debt Market Analysis from privately owned MMS International. They and others give credit-market scuttlebutt such wide play that Federal Reserve officials are sometimes forced to respond to rumors on a minute-to-minute basis. Fed officials, who prefer to blend into the wallpaper, decline to comment for the record about the wires.    The news services that traffic in rumor are trying to increase or protect their shares in a market for financial and economic information that in North America amounted to an estimated $1.2 billion last year and will increase to $1.5 billion this year, according to Link Resources Corp., a research and consulting firm in New York. Wires that carry rumor, with an estimated $400 million in revenue, &quot;have been one of the more successful corners&quot; of the information business, says Peter Falco, a media analyst for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.    The services, many of which are entrenched in financial publishing, call themselves news organizations, not rumor wires, and they publish much more than rumor. MarketScope editors say theirs is &quot;mostly all factual.&quot; It includes many statistical sections and charts. The bond-market services are heavy on facts, too. And PIR is proud of its &quot;powerful, state-of-the-art computer system&quot; that monitors 5,000 stocks for unusual price or volume moves and red-flags them with a &quot;PIR Alert&quot; to subscribers. PIR scored a scoop last month, when one of its reporters broke the story about pre-publication activity in stocks mentioned in Business Week magazine's &quot;Inside Wall Street&quot; column.    Buying a rumor stock in the hope its price will keep rising may offer one way to profit from the wires, but it isn't the only one. Many traders need access to the wires to protect themselves from losses. As often as not, Jack Baker, head equity trader at Shearson Lehman Hutton, relies on the rumor wires to alert him not to sell too fast. Jabbing his finger at a list of rumor-wire headlines on the video screen at his desk, he says some of the headlines will spare him losses.    &quot;If someone comes in and wants to buy 100,000 shares of XYZ and I see (a rumor on the wire that) someone might be looking to acquire XYZ, I save myself money by not being short,&quot; he says. A trader such as Mr. Baker often might offer to fill the buy order by going short-borrowing the stock and selling it. But if he must later buy stock at a higher price to replace the borrowed shares, he will take a loss.    At the desk behind Mr. Baker's, Gail Marie Fiattarone, an assistant charged with monitoring rumors, is taking a telephone call from a MarketScope reporter asking why UAL Corp.'s stock is up. She offers a straightforward explanation that the service will pass on to subscribers: Shearson raised its earnings estimates for the airline company that morning. While some on Wall Street may have been tempted to spice the rumor mill a bit, she says: &quot;I don't like to promulgate rumors. We try to disseminate information.&quot;    Rumor publishing also riles some corporate executives. &quot;I would say that (reporting rumors) is at the level of the National Enquirer or worse,&quot; snaps Arthur Loewy, executive vice president for finance at Zayre Corp., subject of a slew of rumors recently.    Still, rumors have always moved stock prices, and mongering them on Wall Street won't get you blackballed at the country club. Printed publications, including The Wall Street Journal, also have long reported rumors, particularly when they are affecting the market. The wires are simply accelerating that process, for anyone who can pay their fees -- anywhere between $100 and $1,000 a month for a nine-hour-a-day wire. An example of rumor coverage on a recent afternoon from PIR:   --At 2:57 p.m. came the flash &quot;Maytag (MYG) Higher on Renewed Restructuring Rumors.&quot; The stock was at $26.25 a share, up $2 from the previous day's close.    --At 3:21: &quot;Maytag (MYG) Rumors Include Takeover, LBO.&quot; The price by 3:41 soared as high as $27.375 a share, the day's high.    --At 3:43: &quot;Maytag (MYG); Merrill Analyst Dismisses Rumors.&quot; The stock closed minutes later at $26.625, still up $2.375 for the day.    More than a month later, the rumors, including the leveraged buy-out, remain dismissed. Maytag's stock closed yesterday at $23.375, down 62 1/2 cents, a bit below where it was when the rumors began.    Sandamp;P MarketScope, an electronic news service available to professional traders on their quotation-terminal screens, delivers its rumors in a staccato style reminiscent of Walter Winchell gossip columns:   &quot;SANTA FE SOUTHERN, SFX, UP 1 . . . Rumors Henley Group (has 16.7%) buying stock, may force co. to rescind poison pill at Tuesday meeting . . . Co. no news.&quot;    And:   &quot;GOULD, GLD, UP 2 1/4 . . . Buy-out rumors . . . Siemens, WESTINGHOUSE mentioned . . . Also $18 LBO rumor . . . Co. no comment.&quot;    The news services don't merely wait for rumor; they seek it out. MMS, better known as Money Market Services, boasts that it has reporters who circulate among futures traders on exchange floors in Chicago, New York, London and elsewhere to pick up gossip.    The leading efficient-market theorist, Princeton economics professor Burton G. Malkiel, formerly of Yale, has mixed views on the rumor wires. In his wellknown 1973 book, &quot;A Random Walk Down Wall Street,&quot; Mr. Malkiel created the model of the market as a sort of supersmart parimutuel machine, an efficient mechanism for discounting all the extant information bearing on the price of a stock. One implication of the theory is that an investor picking stocks blindfolded stands as much chance of success as one laboriously analyzing the fundamentals.    But inside information that hasn't been discounted, and misleading rumor that has, does confound the market's efficiency, Mr. Malkiel says. Of the rumor reporters, he says, &quot;To the extent that these people in fact are ferreting out information and are able to get it reported, they may tend to make the market more efficient. The dark side of it is that with rumors and tips, far fewer of them are right than are wrong. . . . If you report any rumor you hear, you just sort of get things churning around, and it doesn't make the market more efficient.&quot;    Joseph A. Grundfest, a member of the Securities and Exchange Commission, essentially agrees. &quot;There is a potential for abuse&quot; in the way the wires affect the markets, he says, &quot;but there also is a real possibility for benefit in terms of getting more information, even if it's soft and speculative, to investors that much sooner.&quot;    Corporate executives complain that rumors distributed by the wires promote hectic trading and move stock prices unjustifiably, sometimes before the companies have a chance to discredit the rumors. But rumors often cause such activity even before they are widely published. Consider the recent experience of Genentech Inc., the California biotechnology company. In June, it invited a few medical writers to a briefing on plans to give its new heart-attack drug to poor people. Not exactly a bombshell story, but the rumor mill was cranking out better stuff.    On the morning of the day of the meeting Genentech's stock price had already started to drop when PIR took note. It flashed this to subscribers: &quot;Market sources say PaineWebber biotechnology analyst Linda Miller today told her firm's sales force that a Genentech official told her yesterday that an announcement would be made today.&quot; The item added that the announcement could have &quot;negative implications&quot; for Genentech, and that according to &quot;a man identifying himself as a security guard&quot; at Genentech, company officials were nowhere to be found. By the time the item was published, the stock price had fallen by $1, to $26 a share.    PIR says it had tried between 6:30 a.m. and 7 a.m. Pacific time to reach Genentech executives in South San Francisco. But the executives were in New York preparing for the briefing. After the PIR report, a crush of analysts and reporters descended on the little gathering as the price on Genentech dropped an additional 50 cents a share, to $26.50, its low of the day, on the heaviest volume in weeks.    The meeting proved an anticlimax, and Genentech's stock ended the trading day back up at $26.75 a share, down just 25 cents from the previous day's close. &quot;It caused us a hell of a lot of commotion,&quot; Genentech's corporate communications officer, Frederick M. Hoar, complains. &quot;It was all very new to me. I've never quite seen wires like this before.&quot;    Timothy Andrews, managing editor of PIR, says two brokerage firms had been &quot;saying negative things&quot; about Genentech that morning. He says he sat on the story until it was clear the stock price was falling. At that point, &quot;our job is to explain to people why (traders are) acting the way they're acting.&quot; As for quoting a security guard, Mr. Andrews says: &quot;We clearly labeled him.&quot; He says the guard was getting other calls about a meeting that morning too, something &quot;that could have relevance.&quot;    Brad Allen, an investor relations official at Digital Equipment Co., says the need to respond to rumors forces companies into an awkward position. &quot;People think we've put out press releases right and left just because we're quoted, when we haven't,&quot; he says. &quot;It almost gives the rumors a little bit of credibility, when in reality we just answer the phone.&quot;    Editors defend their rumor coverage. &quot;If a rumor is becoming a market factor, it has to be paid heed to -- there's no denying that,&quot; says Desmond Maberley, executive editor of Reuters North America, a unit of the British company.    Everett Groseclose, founder and executive editor of Dow Jones PIR, says the service relieves his years of frustration in seeing big stock moves -- probably due to trading on unpublicized rumors -- and not having a wire exclusively devoted to explaining what is happening.    Says Joseph L. Oppenheimer, Sandamp;P MarketScope's general manager: &quot;We try not to be a rumor mill, in a sense. But Wall Street acts on these things.&quot; Besides its own rumors, Sandamp;P MarketScope keeps brokers up to date on other people's rumors. One feature, called Touted on TV, summarizes stock gossip from business shows.    Unscrupulous traders can invent and plant rumors -- of, say, a takeover. If the rumor is promptly denied, the trader may not be able to profit, but he won't lose, either. If the rumor isn't promptly denied, and the company's stock price rises in response, the trader could sell the stock short. He could then buy it back at a profit when the rumor finally is discredited and the price falls.    Some employees of the wires privately concede that connivers may have made money off them on occasion. But editors say they can usually spot and screen plants. &quot;I'm shopped stories all the time, and we've begun to develop a little bit of savvy,&quot; says Hillary Johnson, MarketScope assistant manager.    Mr. Oppenheimer stresses that rumors must emanate from two independent sources before they are printed on SLandamp;P MarketScope, and unless it is a slow day, rumors must concern big companies whose shares trade a lot. Mr. Andrews of PIR says a rumor must come from &quot;three basic sources we trust before we repeat it.&quot;    MMS prints the gossip its futures-pit eavesdroppers pick up &quot;if we know it'll have an effect on the marketplace,&quot; says Raul A. Nicho, head of North American operations for MMS International. On June 17, already depressed bond prices fell further after MMS repeated a frequently mongered rumor that Uncle Sam might slap a 5% withholding tax on foreigners' U.S. portfolio earnings, a move that would speed foreign capital out of U.S. markets. So far, it hasn't happened.    BondData will note rumors about, say, the trade deficit, the Gross National Product and big foreign buying in fixed-income securities. Joel M. Marver, BondData's fixed-income analyst, says: &quot;We're careful. We always say there are unconfirmed rumors.&quot; Mr. Maberley of Reuters says he is &quot;supersensitive&quot; about the whole subject. Despite impressions, he says &quot;we don't run any type of rumor services.&quot;    When the rumors hit too close to home, they get special scrutiny. &quot;We let some stories pass,&quot; says James Branscome, editor in chief of McGraw-Hill News. He explains: In the past few years -- if you believe the rumors -- McGraw-Hill itself &quot;has been taken over 5,832 times.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
