Moslem guerrillas fighting the government closed the main roadto the Soviet Union for 10 days, sending food and fuel prices upalmost 50 percent in the capital. Sugar and cooking oil disappearedfrom the markets. Cars vanished from the streets.   On the 10th day, government forces reopened the Salang highwayand trucks rolled in with flour and gasoline.   But the lesson was not lost on what most likely in store for thecold, snowy months ahead.   ``It's going to be a tough time, worse than last year,'' saidMohammad Hakim, president of the Afghanistan Chamber of Commerce.   Ross Mountain, head of the United Nations Development Program inKabul, said if the war goes on poor people could starve.   Last winter a bustling black market blossomed around the Sovietmilitary. Troops sold fuel and flour to Afghans and some Afghansmade small fortunes trafficking in Soviet arms, bought from thesoldiers eager for foreign currency.   Still, many people spent their days cold and hungry in a cityblanketed in snow.   In February, the Soviet troops went home, and with them went animportant source of goods and cash.   Now despite a Soviet aid program that in six months has sent266,543 metric tons of goods overland and thousands more by air,the economy is getting worse as winter closes in.   Prices are already higher than they were in February, a bad signsince food costs in Afghanistan are traditionally lower in autumnwhen it is harvested. A 15-pound sack of flour has almost doubledto the equivalent of $4 and by the end of winter, merchantsestimate, it could hit $10, which is more than many people earn ina month.   Sugar, another staple in the Afghan diet, also has skyrocketedto more than $1 a pound. Tea, the third most important item, hastripled in price.   Women defy the 10 p.m.-3 a.m. curfew and spend nights outsidebakeries to ensure a loaf or two of bread in the morning.   ``I am poor,'' said one elderly woman as she fixed her strawmattress outside one store as the curfew approached. ``My husbandand I need to eat and there is no other way to get bread.''   Despite the inflated prices, salaries remain low.   The average monthly wage hovers between $5 and $12.50.   For many in Kabul, desperation has become a way of life.   Omari Mir Ahmad runs a photo shop in a small house with mudwalls in the old city. His whole family works in the shop and theymake about $45 a month.   Because they run a private bsiness, the family receives nogovernment assistance.   ``I've got seven mouths to feed,'' Ahmad said, motioning aroundhis room, suddenly darkened by one of Kabul's frequent blackouts.``How will I get by?''   At Kabul University, a student wearing florescent pink lipstickand bright white shoes told of her two brothers who were killed bya rocket as they flew their kites.   ``Tell the United States and Russia to send two big bombs toblow us up all at once,'' she said. ``We are sick of dying in bitsand bits and pieces. Let us die together.''   Since rocket attacks were stepped up in June, Zahir Tanin, aprominent editor, has barely allowed his children out of the house.So far about 400 people have been killed.   ``When I look into their eyes, it is difficult for me to bearit,'' he said. ``We are losing a generation. This is the sorrow ofAfghanistan.''   If there is hope here, perhaps it resides in the traditionalcenter of life _ the bazaar.   There, men with brown, weathered faces, gray beards, green eyesand turbans on their heads hawk dried yogurt, grapes and succulentmelons.   Behind a row of buildings lies the grain market. In one cornersits Mohammad Nair, a grizzled merchant.   ``The governmnt is coming to us on its knees,'' he said. ``Theysay they need our help. Only the bazaar will feed the people.Communism has failed.''   In the past few months, the government has returned anunprecedented amount of economic power to the market in an effortto bring food to Afghanistan. It ended a monopoly on thetransportation of fuel and sugar, relaxed already feeble currencytrading regulations and dropped import restrictions and tariffs.   Anything can be bought in Kabul by those with money to pay forthem: portable tape players from Japan, Italian leather goods,Soviet and Iranian caviar, expensive French perfumes and tea fromChina. Many goods are re-exported through the black market toPakistan, India and Iran, which have tighter import controls.   In addition, the government has gone so far as to assuretraffickers who bring stolen goods to market that they should notfear prosecution.   ``Since all this is aimed at peaceful activity, then we supportit,'' said Mayor Abdul Hakim Misaq of Kabul. ``It is better thanrockets.''   But, then, as he spoke the first heavy snows had settled on themountains ringing his city.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Monday AMs, Nov. 20</NOTE></DOC>
