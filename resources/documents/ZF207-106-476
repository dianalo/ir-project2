 Why does the United Statescontinue to lag behind Japan and other countries in productivity growth,despite increased capital investment?andM;&quot;In the broadly defined service sector, from banks to health care clinics,capital spending on computers and office equipment has boomed over the lastdecade -- and productivity has languished,&quot; the magazine reported.andP;  If thesame can be said of government services, we need to ask, what can be doneabout it?andM;Making the reduction of labor the justification for capital investment is themajor reason for the lack of productivity improvement in both themanufacturing and service sectors.andP;  It's a trap; the return on investment istoo small.andM;The report notes that &quot;once the pork has been trimmed ...andP;  that method ofboosting productivity is exhausted.&quot;andP;  The problem begins with the very ideaof productivity.andP;  It's not something real like a hamburger or a haircut.andO;It's a number, the ratio formed by dividing some measure of the output of awork activity by another measure representing its input.andM;This number is supposed to give you an idea of how efficiently resources arebeing used.andP;  But in practice, it's not easy to define and measure outputs andinputs.andM;The output generally is assumed to be the number of units of a product orservice being produced or, more often, their equivalent in dollars --whatever can be counted that appears routinely on a report.andP;  Other outputs,the intangibles such as quality and customer satisfaction that can bemeasured only imprecisely, are used rarely.andM;This misses the whole idea that products are the sum of all of the valueadded to the raw materials used to make them and that they are the physicalembodiments of services they deliver.andM;The input is also a shadow of its real self.andP;  It's usually assumed to be thenumber of labor-hours used to produce the output.andP;  While very concrete, ittotally ignores the other inputs: materials and capital resources, and theirinteractions with labor in producing the output.andP;  The way the work is done,the very heart of systems design, is absent from this calculation.andM;Misleading NumbersandM;The result is that this number, the so-called productivity ratio, is oflimited value as a guide to action and can be very misleading.andP;  Here are acouple of examples from the telecommunications field.andM;For a period up to at least 10 years ago, productivity figures were beingmaintained for various categories of activities in the federal government.andO;The activity that showed the greatest annual improvement in productivity wastelecommunications.andP;  However, when you looked behind the productivity ratios,you found several contradictions.andM;In the long-distance area there had been a steady increase in the number oflong-distance telephone calls being made and in the size of the government'stelephone bill, the output measure that was being used.andP;  However, the workbeing done by government telecommunications personnel had not changed.andM;Their productivity apparently had changed, not because they were getting moredone, but because the numerator in the productivity ratio had increased.andM;In the local service area there also was apparent improvement inproductivity, but for the opposite reason.andP;  Switching of incoming andoutgoing calls by telephone operators was being replaced with private branchexchanges.andP;  As telephone operators departed, the work of the remainingoperators did not change but their productivity appeared to increase becausethe denominator in the productivity ratio had decreased.andM;During that period the output of the government's telecommunicationsactivities changed in ways that were meaningful:andM;* Ease of placing and receiving long-distance calls without operatorintervention.andM;* Low-speed data transmission over voice lines for interactive computing.andM;* Reduced unit cost of both voice and data transmission.andM;None of these true improvements in productivity was reflected in thecalculation of the productivity ratio.andP;  As these examples illustrate, theoutput side of the productivity equation is a very indirect and impreciseindicator of the true output of an activity.andP;  On the other hand, althoughlabor is only one of many inputs, it is a very concrete and precise measure.andO;As a result, labor has become the primary target for productivityimprovement.andM;Concentrate on OutputandM;Focusing on reducing the denominator or the labor side of the productivityratio is not the best way to increase productivity.andP;  Japan leads the nationsof the world in productivity improvement, with an average annual growth rate50 percent above its closest competitors.andM;Yet in Japan, labor historically has been treated as a fixed cost.andP;  Thetypical Japanese worker, whether in government or the private sector, oncehired is assured of a job for life.andP;  What better evidence is needed that it'sthe output side of the productivity ratio that needs attention?andM;American manufacturers now are beginning to look at other ways of justifyingcapital investments of all kinds, including computers.andP;  The new approachesemphasize better quality, increased sales, on-time delivery, reducedinventories, manufacturing flexibility, shorter manufacturing cycles,improved control of material flow, reduced setup time, reduced product costs,faster order processing and customer satisfaction.andM;All of these contribute to an overall increase in productivity but arespecific design objectives for automation projects that seek to improve theoutput rather than decrease the input of work activities.andM;I would like to see a similar change in attitude toward office automation inthe federal workplace.andP;  Instead of slogans such as &quot;do more with less,&quot; withthe emphasis on the less, the focus should be on how to do the real work ofthe federal government better.andM;Let's put the emphasis where it should be -- on improving the delivery ofservices to the citizens our government is intended to serve.andM;President Reagan's last management report said every manager is now aninformation technology manager and added, &quot;The government must create anenvironment that fosters innovation and creativity.&quot; I presume that willcontinue to be the information technology policy of the Bush administrationand should be the principal concern of the senior official for informationresources management in every agency.andM;Then it's up to all government managers to find ways of using informationtechnology to improve that part of the federal services delivery system forwhich they are responsible.andP;  Otherwise, as Stephen S. Cohen, director of theBerkeley Roundtable of the International Economy, said, &quot;We manage by thenumbers, we judge by the numbers -- and we lose by the numbers.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
