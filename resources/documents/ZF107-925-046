Latham, president of Lockheed Missilesand Space Company Inc.'s Command, Control and Communications Division, saidat the conference.andP;  However, he argued that the federal market is &quot;lush withnew technology,&quot; although in many cases users do not know what to do with itall.andM;In fact, Latham said, the government is willing to act as an incubator fornew technology and takes on the task of setting standards.andM;Complex systems result in complex management problems.andP;  &quot;Agencies that takeaggressive, well-reasoned steps will be the winners,&quot; Kusek said.andM;Popular &quot;one-time mega-projects&quot; must be integrated beyond simple productinteroperability, Kusek said.andP;  But agencies often are at the mercy ofvendors, even though government demand drives the industry.andM;Agencies have two integration choices.andP;  Large commodity computer andcommunications product and services buys do not provide an integratedsolution, Kusek said.andP;  A functional requirements contract &quot;does not acohesive system make,&quot; he said.andM;The alternative is the tailored systems integration contract that makes theintegrator responsible and liable for the system.andM;&quot;Either way, complexity and change are the watchwords of the 1990s,&quot; Kuseksaid.andM;In the early 1990s, agencies will focus on communications and computersecurity, communications in total and integrated information and imagemanagement.andM;Continuing legal mandates &quot;will put teeth into security measures,&quot; Kuseksaid.andP;  Disasters, liabilities and more malicious threats hitting closer tohome also will force agencies to deal with security issues.andM;FTS 2000's digital backbone will be a communications focal point for theagencies.andP;  &quot;Agencies are just beginning to investigate how to use FTS 2000,&quot;he said.andM;Many agencies need help in finding the best way to mesh voice, data and videorequirements.andM;Pitfalls to advancements in communications, Kusek said, include high costsfor some services and technologies, a lack of mature standards and a lack ofinformation about some services, such as video.andM;Agencies are moving quickly to take advantage of an integrated informationand image management, Kusek said.andP;  Such a system eliminates duplicate effortsand makes it easier to capture and manipulate text and data.andM;Many enabling technologies are becoming more affordable, Latham said.andO;Optical jukeboxes take up little floor space and store large masses of highlyorganized data.andM;Infinite storage systems with artificial intelligence-based front ends canmigrate data between different types of media, and software allows users toview, manipulate and manage images, Latham said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
