The revisions and the rationalefor EPA's proposed approval were explained in the NPR. It will not be restatedhere because the rationale has not changed since the revision was submittedto EPA on July l, 1987. No public comments were received on the NPR. In the NPR, in the last paragraph on page 28023, EPA determined that theState had adopted 40 CFR 51.118 for application to its new source permittingprogram. As a result, section 5(f) of the Arkansas regulation implicitlyrequires that permits containing emission limitations based on GEP-SH inexcess of formula height be submitted to EPA for review and approval, presumablyas SIP revisions. Although the requirements for EPA review of any suchpermits is more administratively cumbersome than the Clean Air Act or EPA'sregulations require, it is found acceptable. The State was asked to confirmEPA's interpretation of the regulation or to amend the regulation to reflectits true intent prior to final approval. The State, in a letter to EPARegion 6 dated September 7, 1988, confirmed EPA's interpretation of section5(f) and notified EPA that the State did not intend to change the regulationat this time. The EPA's stack-height regulations were challenged in NRDC vs. Thomas,838 F.2d 1224 (D.C. Cir. 1988). On January 22, 1988, the U.S. Court ofAppeals for the D.C. Circuit issued its decision affirming the regulationsin large part, but remanding three provisions to the EPA for reconsideration.These are: 1. Grandfathering pre-October 11, 1983, within formula stack height increasesfrom demonstration requirements (40 CFR 51.100(kk)(2));2. Dispersion credit for sources originally designed and constructed withmerged or multiflue stacks (40 CFR 51.100(hh)(2)(ii)(A)); and 3. Grandfathering pre-1979 use of the refined H + 1.5L formula (40 CFR51.100(ii)(2)). Although the EPA generally approves Arkansas' stack height rules on thegrounds that they satisfy 40 CFR Part 51, the EPA also provides noticethat this action may be subject to modification when EPA completes rulemakingto respond to the decision in NRDC v. Thomas, 838 F.2d 1224 (D.C. Cir.1988). If the EPA's response to the NRDC remand modifies the July 8, 1985,regulations, the EPA will notify the State of Arkansas that its rules mustbe changed to comport with the EPA's modified requirements. This may resultin revised emission limitations or may affect other actions taken by Arkansasand source owners or operators. Final Action: EPA is approving a revision to the Arkansas State ImplementationPlan (SIP) which adds the Arkansas Good Engineering Practice Stack Height(GEP-SH) Regulations to the Arkansas SIP. The State has added its GEP-SHRegulations to sections 3 and 5 of its Regulations of the Arkansas Planof Implementation for Air Pollution Control. The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof section 3 of Executive Order 12291. Under section 307(b)(1) of the Act, petitions for judicial review of thisaction must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriatecircuit by April 24, 1989. This action may not be challenged later in proceedingsto enforce its requirements.
