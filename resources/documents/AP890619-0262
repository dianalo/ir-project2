(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Patents, the guard dogs of innovation, aregaining strength and attention as America's first line of defenseagainst purloined corporate ingenuity.   An unprecedented number of applications are flooding the U.S.Patent and Trademark Office, which expects more than 156,000 thisyear, up 5 percent from last year.   Courts are siding more often with holders of patents, trademarksand copyrights, and the phrase ``intellectual property'' has enteredthe lexicon of the emerging knowledge-based economy.   Why all the interest? Because American industry, from steel toclothing to microwave ovens, is running scared.   ``If you're the undisputed leader in some technology, patents arenot that important because you pretty much call the shots. That'swhat it was like 30 years ago,'' said Michael Blommer, executivedirector of the American Intellectual Property Law Association.   ``But today, the United States has lost its lead in almost everytechnology and patents are becoming much more important. That'sreally all you have to protect yourself.''   Some critics say the pendulum has swung too far toward protectingpatent and copyright holders, stifling progress by preventinginventors from building on what has come before.   Others say tough patent protection isn't helping the UnitedStates against technology leaders such as Japan and West Germany.Eight of the top 10 winners of U.S. patents last year were foreigncompanies.   ``Isn't strengthening the patent system also strengthening thenon-residents?'' asked Ogden Webster, director of Eastman KodakCo.'s patent law department.   One winner in the patent battlefield is Corning Inc., formerlyknown as Corning Glass Works, where engineers revolutionizedcommunications in 1970 with their invention of optical fibers.   These are hair-thin glass fibers that transport voices, picturesand data on pulses of laser light. Optical-fiber cables crisscrossthe country and the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.   Corning anticipated billions of dollars in revenue from itsinvention. However, other companies were eyeing the potentialmarket, too.   Six years after the invention, even before much of the world wasconvinced of the usefulness of Corning's creation, the company founditself trying to enforce its patents.   Corning sued American, Dutch and Japanese competitors. It evensued the U.S. government for buying fiber from a competitor. FromJuly 1976 until earlier this year, the company was immersed inpatent enforcement lawsuits.   The company won numerous settlements, but Sumitomo ElectricIndustries Ltd. of Japan remained a holdout. The Japanese companyeven built a factory in Research Triangle Park, N.C., to make fibers.   Corning won a court order in October 1987 forcing Sumitomo tostop making optical fiber at its North Carolina plant. Sumitomo wasallowed to make cable but had to get the fiber for it from acompetitor.   The damage portion of the patent infringement trial is pending.Today, Corning is the dominant producer.   ``Corning is a believer in the patent system. It's very much apart of its research activity. To see it working is good,'' said AlMichaelsen, Corning's chief patent lawyer.   The Corning experience is one that politicians and governmentofficials like to hear.   ``As we look to the future, our ability to compete successfullyis going to depend on our brainpower, not our brawn,'' said MichaelKirk, assistant commissioner for external affairs at the U.S. Patentand Trademark Office.   A report by the U.S. International Trade Commission last yearestimated U.S. companies lose between $43 billion and $61 billion ayear because of inadequate foreign protection of intellectualproperty.   Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand reportedly have begun to cleansetheir reputations as piracy havens, but South Korea is still a majoroffender, the commission says.   Companies must apply for patents in each country where they wantprotection. Rules differ. For instance, Italy refuses to grantpatents to new drugs.   Japan's patent office takes five years on average to issue apatent, vs. about 1{ years in the United States, says Donald J.Quigg, U.S. commissioner of patents and trademarks.   An American inventor awaiting a patent in Japan has little legalprotection and therefore is almost forced to share the technologywith competitors through cross-licensing agreements, Quigg complains.   It is much easier for Japanese companies to get patents in theUnited States. For example, Hitachi Ltd. won more U.S. patents lastyear than any American company.   Kirk is helping negotiate minimum patent standards in trade talksinvolving 100 nations and said he is hopeful an agreement can bereached by the end of 1990.   In this country, perhaps the biggest development came in 1982with the creation of a federal appeals court in Washington devotedsolely to intellectual property disputes.   ``This court has really turned toward lowering the standard ofpatentability and upholding patents,'' said Kodak's Webster. Heshould know: The court rejected Kodak's appeal of a guilty verdictin a suit by Polaroid Corp. that forced it out of instantphotography.   By aggressively enforcing its patent rights, Texas InstrumentsInc. earned almost as much in royalties in 1987 _ $191 million _ asit did from operations. Last year, royalties accounted for a quarterof its profits.   Lotus Development Corp. and Apple Computer Inc. are facingcriticism for heavy-handed protection of patents on the ``look andfeel'' of their products, such as the Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet.   To critics, patents protecting ``look and feel'' are theequivalent of a patent by General Motors Corp. protecting thearrangement of the steering wheel, brake and gas pedals on a car.   Reflecting the turmoil, two-thirds of big companies in the UnitedStates, Canada and Europe are enmeshed in litigation overintellectual property rights, a Conference Board survey estimates.</TEXT><NOTE>End adv for Sunday June 25</NOTE></DOC>
