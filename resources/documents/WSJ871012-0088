SchlenderStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 10/12/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> AMDEARNINGS (ERN)ELECTRIC, ELECTRONICS, APPLIANCES (ELE) </IN><TEXT>   Advanced Micro Devices Inc., despite a robust turnaround in the semiconductor industry, reported a wider than expected third-quarter loss -- even after accounting for a large one-time charge.    The Sunnyvale, Calif.-based company, which acquired Monolithic Memories Inc. during the quarter ended Sept. 27, posted a net loss of $53.8 million, including a one-time charge of $41 million related to the acquisition. That compares with a combined year-earlier net loss for the companies of $43 million during the darkest period of a two-year-long industrywide slump. Sales rose 14% to $260.9 million from combined sales of $229.1 million.    Since last year's third quarter the semiconductor industry has rebounded, largely because the resurgent computer and office automation industries fueled demand for chip products. Accordingly, other large Silicon Valley chip makers have bounded back into the black.    Last week, for example, Santa Clara, Calif.-based Intel Corp. reported third-quarter profit of $52 million, or 29 cents a share, on revenue of $501.1 million, compared with a year-earlier loss of $114.2 million on revenue of $324.1 million.    Advanced Micro's chairman and chief executive officer, W.J. Sanders III, conceded that the company's &quot;three major business units are not enjoying to the same level the benefits of the business upturn.&quot; While the company's division that supplies microprocessors to the personal computer and office automation industries &quot;is experiencing healthy demand,&quot; the anchor on Advanced Micro's performance is its memory-chip division, which continues to suffer heavy losses, Mr. Sanders said.    On Friday, Advanced Micro shares fell 62.5 cents to close at $22.25 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.    Analysts said they were surprised that Advanced Micro didn't come closer to reporting an operating profit after taking into account one-time charges for the acquisition of Monolithic Memories. &quot;We expected them to write down everything but the kitchen sink, which they did, but we didn't expect them to be this far from breaking even,&quot; said Millard Phelps, a chip industry analyst for Hambrecht andamp; Quist Inc.    Mr. Sanders noted that Advanced Micro's orders for semiconductors exceeded shipments, despite the confusion of merging the sales efforts of the newly combined companies. That indicates that sales will continue to grow in coming quarters. Moreover, he added, &quot;the process of integration should be complete&quot; in the coming quarter, which should spur sales of Advanced Micro products and lessen redundant sales costs.    For the nine months, Advanced Micro had a net loss of $45.4 million on sales of $734.5 million, compared with a year-earlier net loss of $77.7 million on sales of $630.9 million. Year-earlier figures were restated to reflect the acquisition of Monolithic Memories. </TEXT></DOC>
