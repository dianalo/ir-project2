He also said needed improvement in equipment and operatingprocedures throughout the nuclear weapons production complex nearAiken, S.C., would take years to implement.   In the past few months, nuclear weapons production has ground toa virtual halt following shutdown of the three reactors at SavannahRiver, the closure of a building at the Rocky Flats Plant nearDenver and a strike which has shut down the Feed MaterialsProduction Center in Fernald, near Cincinnati, Ohio.   The Savannah River reactors are the only facilities in the UnitedStates now capable of producing plutonium and tritium, which areneeded to make nuclear weapons. Plutonium supplies are plentiful,but the tritium shortage will cause problems sometime in the nextsix to 24 months, according to congressional and administrationsources.   Starostecki compared the state of the federal nuclear weaponscomplex to that of the commerical nuclear power industry after theaccident at the Three Mile Island plant near Harrisburg, Pa., onMarch 28, 1979.   He said it would take years to install safer equipment and raisetraining standards to levels commensurate with those found inprivate industry.   ``These are programs that will take years to develop,''Starostecki said in an inteview Tuesday. He envisioned widescaleintroduction of robotics and remote handling devices to protect thehealth of workers, but was unable to estimate the cost of suchsystemwide improvements.   To outline restart plans and get a firmer grip on a timetable forSavannah River, Starostecki said, he was meeting this week withmanagers from the department's office in Aiken and from E.I. DuPontNemours Co., the current contract operator, and Westinghouse Corp.,which is to take over the plant next April 1.   ``I am not focusing on the date,'' said Starostecki. ``My goalthis week is to get the people at the contract level, the DuPontpeople, the Westinghouse people, along with DOE managers, to reviewthe status of the detailed technical acceptance criteria we aregoing to be expecting those reactors to meet.   ``The date will come out as a natural part of the dialogue,'' hesaid.   Last month, Energy Secretary John S. Herrington said he hoped tobegin a phased start-up of the plant's L-reactor in December,reaching 50 percent capacity over about a month. Each of the plant'sthree reactors, which began began operation in 1954, is restrictedto 50 percent of full power due to safety concerns.   ``We will provide the secretary with an estimate of what it takesand when ... by the end of the month,'' said Starostecki.   A spokeswoman for DuPont at Savannah River, Becky Apter, said``the last date I heard was Dec. 31,'' and that was subject to delay.   Starostecki said the Energy Department would develop what hecalled ``compensatory'' operating procedures to allow safe operationof the facilities. For Savannah River, those steps include:   _Requiring reactor operators to practice accident controltechniques extensively on a simulator;   _Requiring the presence of a degree-holding engineer in thecontrol room;   _Adding more highly trained managers and operators to the staffsof the contractor and the regional department office;   _Reorganizing and improving communication between contractor anddepartmental employees, in particular assuring that those who manageand analyze the plant are in close contact with those in the controlroom;   _Developing detailed technical criteria on the operation of theplant, and making sure it is in the hands of the operators, a stepwhich has not been taken before;   _Analyzing the ability of the reactors to withstand earthquakes,a process now underway.</TEXT></DOC>
