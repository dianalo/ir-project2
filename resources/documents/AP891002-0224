(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   PTL founder Jim Bakker testified Mondayat his fraud trial that he and his wife, Tammy, accepted $3.1million in bonuses while the ministry's finances foundered.   Bakker said PTL board members granted the bonuses ``of their ownfree will'' and often told him, ``I was worth much more than this,and they would say that over and over again.''   Bakker left the witness stand Monday, completing 10 hours oftestimony that began Friday. Both sides rested their cases Monday,with closing arguments scheduled for Tuesday. The case could go tothe jury as early as Wednesday.   The disgraced television evangelist testified that he raisedmore than $425 million for PTL from 1984 to 1987, when he and hiswife received $3.1 million in bonuses.   Bakker was asked by his lawyer, George Davis, what he did withthe $425 million.   ``I put it to the work of Jesus Christ,'' he said.   During defense questioning, Bakker summed up his defense: ``Wewere a church, and people always wanted to run it like a business.I had to keep telling them, this was a church, not a business.''   As Bakker left court during a break, he was smiling, saying, ``Ifeel fine.'' He turned to Davis and said, ``This is a nice place tovisit but I didn't plan to live here.''   In other testimony, M.C. Benton, the trustee overseeing theministry's property since it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcyprotection from creditors, testified PTL was $50 million in debtand had $160 million in claims against it from ``lifetimepartners'' when Bakker resigned in March 1987.   Bakker, 49, is charged with 15 counts of wire fraud, eightcounts of mail fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit wire andmail fraud. Bakker is accused of diverting more than $3.7 millionin PTL money for his own benefit and of conspiring to defraud PTLfollowers to support his lifestyle.   If convicted, he faces up to 120 years in prison and more than$5 million in fines.   Richard Dortch, PTL's former executive vice president, wassentenced Aug. 24 to eight years in prison and fined $200,000 undera plea bargain. Dortch pleaded guilty to two counts of wire fraudand one count each of mail fraud and conspiracy and testifiedagainst Bakker.   At the heart of the government's case is the charge that Bakkerfailed to live up to his promises of providing lodging at PTLfacilities for nearly 153,000 ``partners,'' people who sent ingifts of $1,000 or more.   Bakker is accused of diverting money from $158 million incontributions solicited to build lodging for donors. Bakkertestified Friday that based on his own calculations he couldaccommodate more than 211,000 partners.   ``Your long list (of available lodging) for the partners isreally a recent fabrication you prepared for this trial?'' specialprosecutor Deborah Smith asked Bakker.   ``That's a lie,'' he responded.   Christine Howe, a supervisor at PTL's Heritage Grand Hotel,testified she had to turn away thousands of guests each monthbecause there was no room for them.   Ms. Smith said Bakker failed to tell PTL board members about theministry's money problems.   ``I don't know how the board members could not be aware of thefinancial crisis at Heritage USA,'' Bakker testified. ``They knewwe had cash flow problems and they voted to borrow funds to pay forthem.''   Ms. Smith asked Bakker if he was contradicting testimony fromsix board members who said they didn't know about the ministry'sfinancial problems.   ``I would tell them we were in great financial need. They werealways up to date on all the financial information,'' Bakker said.``I gave them the information to the best of my ability.''   But Bakker later acknowledged he may have painted a rosy pictureof PTL's finances to fellow board members.   ``I was a minister,'' he said. ``I did my best to keep theminformed and I know I was positive in the face of turmoil at times.I preached faith.''</TEXT></DOC>
