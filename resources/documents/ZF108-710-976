Olsen, DigitalandM;John A. Rollwagen, Cray Research     John A. Young, Hewlett-PackardandM;John F. Akers, IBM                   Charles E. Exley Jr., NCRandM;Scott G. McNealy, Sun Microsystems   James G. Treybig, TandemandM;James A. Unruh, Unisys.andM;The recommendations include specific proposals for increasing worldwidemarket access for U.S.andP;  companies and for modifying an- tidumping laws tomake them a more effective element of U.S.andP;  trade policy.andM;&quot;Market access for high-technology industries must be a prime U.S.andP;  tradepolicy objective,&quot; said John A. Young of CSPP and president and chiefexecutive officer of Hewlett-Packard Co.andM;&quot;While we believe that a more effective multilateral system is the mostimportant tool for achieving open markets, we also know that the time hascome for us to develop a fresh approach to bilateral market accessinitiatives to complement multilateral market-access efforts.&quot;andM;The Computer Systems Policy Project is an affiliation of 11 CEOs from thecomputer systems industry who joined together last year to formulate andpersonally advocate public policy recommendations on issues that are ofcritical importance to the computer systems industry.andM;FOUR-STEP APPROACH CSPP proposes a four step approach to increased access toclosed foreign markets: identify those markets that require bilateralmarket-opening initiatives; establish, through bilateral nego- tiations,specific actions to be taken to achieve an open market by a date certain;periodically apply measures of progress; and support the government's use ofcarefully crafted sanctions if necessary to achieve results.andP;  This 4-stepprocess is used to regularly measure progress toward a successfully openedmarket.andM;CSPP's approach to bilateral market access is its emphasis on results: salesmade, market shares gained, and revenue received.andM;&quot;What we need and want are opportunities to compete,&quot; Young said.andP;  &quot;Webelieve that results can be achieved without resorting to managed trade.andM;&quot;Another issue of considerable importance to us is the debate over reform ofthe U.S.andP;  antidumping laws and the antidumping provisions of the GATT,&quot; Youngsaid.andP;  &quot;The antidumping laws constitute a powerful weapon in the trade policyarsenal.andP;  Effective antidump- ing laws are one element of the businessenvironment necessary to nuture a healthy U.S.andP;  high-technology sector.&quot;andM;Currently the debate over reform of the GATT Antidumping Code and of thecorresponding national antidumping laws is becoming intense in the UruguayRound and antidumping laws are being applied in- creasingly here and abroadto high-technology products.andM;CSPP's approach to antidumping law reform is to enhance the capacity of thelaws to deter multiple offenses and circumvention, to improve the ability ofgovernment decision makers to address issues of critical importance involvingthe scope of the inves- tigation and the availability of domestic suppliesand to sharpen the focus of the laws on pricing practices that are bothunfair and injurious.andM;CSPP has focused on four antidumping law reform proposals; realis- tic costcalculations to determine whether there is unfair pric- ing; deterrence ofinjuriously unfair pricing; measures to combat circumvention of antidumpingrelief, and recognition of marketplace realities.andM;&quot;These antidumping law reform proposals, which build on the reforms enactedin 1988, would enhance the international competi- tiveness of Americansystems producers and other high-technology industries,&quot; Young said.andM;&quot;Together these two initial CSPP proposals on market and antidump- ing lawreform reflect our conviction that American high technol- ogy industries willcompete, and compete successfully, in an open and fair global tradingsystem,&quot; continued Young.andM;CSPP FACT SHEET MARKET ACCESS AND ANTIDUMPING LAW REFORM CSPP proposes a fourstep market-access process which would be a more effective bilateral approachthat would compliment multi- lateral market access efforts.andM;-- Identify markets in which multilateral efforts have failed to provide realopportunities for competitive products.andM;-- Establish, through bilateral agreement, specific actions to achieve anopen market by a date certain.andM;-- Measure progress toward open market by periodically reassess- ing, underthe then current circumstances, the opportunities for competitive products inthe market.andM;-- If necessary to spur progress, use government imposed sanctions that arecarefully designed to achieve maximum effect in a closed market and minimumdamage to U.S.andP;  industries.andM;CSPP's recommendations for antidumping law reform include the fol- lowingfour elements, which together constitute a balanced ap- proach:andM;1.andP;  Realistic cost calculations to determine whether there isandM;unfair pricing.andM;-- Revise GATT Antidumping Code and U.S.andP;  laws;andM;-- Expressly permit pricing below average unit costs during periodandM;of introduction of new products;andM;-- Expressly permit allocation of capital and Randamp;D costs overandM;product life cycle;andM;-- Require product specific determination of introductory periodandM;and life cycle.andM;2.andP;  Deterrence of Injuriously Unfair Pricing.andM;-- Sharply define &quot;Multiple Offender,&quot;andM;-- Expedite antidumping investigations of all multiple offenders;andM;-- For second offense, assess antidumping duties back to date ofandM;initiation of investigation;andM;-- For third offense, assess antidumping duties back to as much asandM;two years before date of initiation, with foreign producersandM;liable for pre-initiation duties;andM;-- Revise GATT Antidumping Code accordinglyandM;3.andP;  Measures to Combat Circumvention of Antidumping Relief.andM;-- Monitor effectiveness of present U.S.andP;  law (effective 1988);andM;-- Add to GATT Antidumping Code Anti-Circumvention measures onandM;parts and Components;andM;-- Add to GATT Antidumping Code measures against Third-CountryandM;dumpingandM;4.andP;  Recognitiion of Marketplace RealitiesandM;-- Define &quot;Like Product&quot; so that antidumping relief cannot beandM;imposed on imported products for which there is no competitiveandM;domestic product;andM;-- Permit deferral or prompt suspension of antidumping duties onandM;products in short supply, with resumption of duties onceandM;domestic supplies become adequate;andM;-- Accord industrial users the right to participate in antidumpingandM;proceeding on these specific issues.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
