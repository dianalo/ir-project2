(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Chewing tobacco is like picking the banjo,they say around here, a peculiarly American practice.   So while cigarette manufacturers are battling declining sales inthe United States by opening new markets in Asia and the ThirdWorld, the producers of smokeless tobacco still must look to thehomefolks.   Luther Pittman, executive vice president of operations forPinkerton Tobacco Co. in Owensboro concedes today's chewing tobaccomarket is ``a mature industry.'' He should know. He grew up on atobacco farm in North Carolina and has worked in the tobaccobusiness for 41 years.   ``The only way we're going to get a lot of growth will be gettingbusiness from our competition,'' says Pittman, whose company formore than 100 years has been producing chewing tobacco with nameslike Red Man, Spark Plug, Day's Work, Brown's Mule and A Man's Chew.   ``Of course, they're trying to do the same thing.''   That's not to say everybody has quit chewing and spitting.   Despite the repeated warnings about the dangers of tobacco,Americans still poked more than 64 million pounds of loose-leaf chewinto their cheeks last year, not counting the hard plugs of chewingtobacco.   Production of all smokeless tobacco products _ which includessnuff _ declined from 133.7 million pounds in 1985 to 125.5 millionpounds in 1986, and slipped another 3.2 percent in 1987, accordingto figures compiled by John Maxwell of Wheat First Securities inRichmond, Va.   One reason for chewing tobacco's decline, Maxwell says, is itsinconvenience and the way co-workers view spitting in public.   ``It goes OK on the playing field, but it doesn't go over toowell in the office,'' he says.   But even that wad in the jaw of a baseball player these days islikely to be bubble gum. And who's seen a spittoon in service lately?   Pinkerton's research indicates people who chew are mostlyblue-collar males, with use pretty well spread among people 25 to 55years of age, Pittman says.   ``We had always looked at our customers as being farmers,construction people, miners _ people who use both hands inworking,'' Pittman says. ``It's easier for them to chew tobacco thanit is to smoke.''   But the market may be changing slightly. Recent company surveysshow 20 percent of smokeless tobacco users have household incomes ofmore than $50,000, he says.   The Pinkerton Tobacco Co. is a privately held subsidiary of ThePinkerton Group of Richmond, which is owned by Swedish Tobacco Co.in Stockholm.   Maxwell's figures indicate Pinkerton's biggest competitor forloose-leaf customers is Conwood Co L.P. based in Memphis, Tenn.,which makes Levi Garrett.   Levi Garrett edged slightly ahead of Red Man in 1988, Maxwellsays, selling 17.95 million pounds to Red Man's 17.75 million pounds.   Regardless of who the competition is, marketing is a big part ofstaying ahead, Pittman says.   The company advertised primarily on TV before the federalgovernment banned such ads. Now it uses newspapers, magazines andpromotional events, such as tractor pulls.   It makes about 500,000 of the familiar Red Man caps a year forpromotional purposes.   Pinkerton employs 520 workers at its plant in western Kentucky,where it makes 14 brands of plug chewing tobacco, seven brands ofloose-leaf and nine brands of pipe tobacco. (Workers are notrequired to use tobacco, but those who do are entitled to one freePinkerton product of their choice per day.)   The fragrant smell of tobacco fills the packing room floor at theOwensboro plant. Even ardent tobacco opponents probably would haveto admit the place smells wonderful.   But while the fragrance is allowed to linger, scraps are not. Asworkers run machinery and oversee packing operations, others sweepup loose pieces of tobacco.   ``People who come in here say they're utterly amazed at how cleanit is,'' Pittman says. ``But we're manufacturing a product peopleuse orally. We've got to keep it clean.''   Inside the factory, a pouch of tobacco can be cut, folded,filled, boxed and on a conveyor belt within three minutes. The plantproduces hundreds of thousands of pouches a day.   The company's 2,000 wholesale customers order by telephone or faxmachine, and workers record the orders on a sophisticated computersystem.   Here are some other facts about the chewing tobacco business:   _Pinkerton, which celebrated its 100th anniversary in 1987, movedits factory from Toledo, Ohio, to Owensboro in 1973.   _Though Pinkerton uses Kentucky-grown tobacco in some products,Red Man is made primarily from tobacco grown in Wisconsin andPennsylvania, with smaller amounts from Connecticut.   _North Carolina leads in total volume of chewing tobaccoconsumed. Kentucky ranks eighth.   Heading a company that makes tobacco products isn't a problem forPittman.   ``I've literally been in tobacco all my life,'' he says.   ``I use all forms of tobacco. The only answer I can give is I'mworking in an industry that manufactures and sells a perfectlylegitimate, legal product supporting consumer demand.   ``Tobacco has paid an awful lot of bills since the Revolution andeven before.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, July 23</NOTE></DOC>
