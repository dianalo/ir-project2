Jean-Claude Paul is ahousehold name in the capital Port-au-Prince, but one that fewpeople are comfortable speaking out loud.   Paul was indicted Wednesday on drug trafficking charges in U.S.District Court in Miami, but many radio stations in the Haitiancapital chose not to broadcast the news. Of those that did, onlyone, the Roman Catholic station Radio Soleil, identified Paul byname.   ``We're not yet going to announce the news ... for securityreasons,'' a reporter at the independent station Radio Metropolesaid Thursday, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``We've alreadyreceived threats. We'll announce the news when it's formally madepublic.''   Paul has been prominent in the impoverished Caribbean nation of6 million since he was promote to colonel and given command of the700-man Dessalines Battalion in January 1986.   The battalion, quartered in a low-slung, mustard coloredbuilding adjacent to the National Palace, was involved in almostevery incident last summer in which soldiers broke up peacefulanti-government demonstrations. More than 30 people were killed and200 wounded.   Opposition leaders blame the battalion for standing by idly Nov.29 while gunmen in the capital killed at least 34 people, forcingthe cancellation of what would have been Haiti's first freepresidential vote in 30 years.   Paul refused requests to be interviewed at that time. Hiscolleagues and superiors have publicly defended and shielded him.   Leslie Manigat was elected president Jan. 17 in ballotingboycotted by the opposition and marked by widespread irregularities.   A communique three weeks ago by army Chief of Staff Gen. CarlNicolas rebutted the ``so-called involvement of (Paul) in affairsof drug trafficking.''   Col. Gary Leon, a spokesman for the military, refused a requestThursday by The Associated Press for biographical information onPaul.   Nevertheless, a sketchy picture of Paul emerged from interviewswith acquaintances, colleagues and foreign observers, most of whomspoke on condition their names not be used.   Paul was born in 1938 to a family that supported dictatorFrancois ``Papa Doc'' Duvalier.   His father was a high-ranking member of the Tontons Macouteprivate militia. It was organized by Duvalier to throttle politicalopposition and challenge the power of the army, which launchedseveral coups against Duvalier after his election in 1957.   Paul's brother Alexandre was Haiti's consul general to theBahamas and the United States, based in Miami, until the Duvalierfamily dictatorship ended in February 1986 with the flight ofJean-Claude Duvalier to France following popular demonstrations.   As a young officer, Paul was a protege of Francois Duvalier'sfinance minister, Clovis Desinor. He rose through the ranks duringthe 1970s and served with the elite Leopards counterinsurgencysquad before taking command of the Dessalines Battalion.   Rumors of Paul's alleged involvement with cocaine traffickingsurfaced in March 1987 when his ex-wife, Marie Merielle Delinois,was arrested in Miami on drug charges. She pleaded innocent, wasreleased on $250,000 bond and promptly fled.   Paul and his brother Antonio face three drug counts _ conspiracyto distribute, distribution and attempted importation of cocaineinto the United States. They could face up to 45 years in prisonand $375,000 in fines if they are convicted. Ms. Delinois was alsoindicted.   ``Jean-Claude Paul's activity in cocaine smuggling is wellknown,'' said one Western diplomat in a recent interview. ``He hasa landing strip near Thomozeau,'' a village about 90 milesnortheast of the capital near Haiti's border with the DominicanRepublic.   Raymond Joseph, publisher of the Brooklyn, N.Y.-based newspaper``Haiti Observateur,'' said the colonel has several houses in andaround the capital, in addition to a cattle ranch in Thomozeau.   Paul, a short, stocky man who customarily wears a ring, braceletand necklace of heavy gold, lives above his salary of $1,800 amonth, said Joseph.   The mission of Dessalines Battalion is to help police provideorder in the capital. Paul is seen most frequently in publicproviding security for top government officials.   The Western diplomat said Paul is popular with his troops andpays them extra from his own pocket.   ``He (Paul) ignores the chain of command,'' said the diplomat,who added that Paul incorporated about 100 Tontons Macoutes intohis battalion and helped others flee Haiti at the end of theDuvalier dictatorship.   ``He is capable of making a coup d'etat,'' the diplomat said.</TEXT></DOC>
