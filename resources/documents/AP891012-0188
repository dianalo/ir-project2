Manuel Antonio Noriega.   Raul Escoffery, executive director of the Panamanian HumanRights Committee, said the casualty figure was based on sketchyevidence but challenged the Panamanian Defense Forces to disproveit.   ``If it's not true, we will say it publicly,'' Escoffery said.``But until the government cooperates with us, we presume ourinformation to be true.''   Robert Troncoso, the rights committee's vice president, said hebelieved the information the committee has is too sketchy to giveany estimates.   The day after the Oct. 3 coup attempt, the Defense Forces issueda communique that said 10 rebels were killed and 37 detained in theuprising.   Troncoso and Escoffery said the rights group had received dozensof telephone calls, most of them anonymous, from people who said arelative, friend or neighbor in the military had not been seensince the uprising.   ``We presume there are many more than this,'' Troncoso said. Buthe said repeatedly that the evidence was too sketchy to be precise.   The committee wrote to Noriega, head of Panama's Defense Forcesand therefore leader of the country, three days after the failedcoup asking permission to visit imprisoned mutineers.   ``We are still awaiting a reply,'' Troncoso said.   The rights officials and family members contacted by TheAssociated Press said they did not know where prisoners were beingheld.   President Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela has accused theDefense Forces of carrying out summary executions.   Defense Forces spokesmen have denied reports an enraged Noriegapersonally shot the coup leader minutes after the uprising wasquashed. That was one question foreign journalists permitted tointerview Noriega were forbidden to ask.</TEXT></DOC>
