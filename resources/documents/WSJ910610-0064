Chase, the nation's third largest bank, operates twoprivate banking offices in Los Angeles and San Francisco,managing $1 billion in investments for individuals whoseannual income exceeds $250,000. Acquiring a state-charteredcommercial bank would allow it to seek deposits and makeloans to that customer group.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;It's under consideration,&quot; said Deborah L. Talbot, seniorvice president for private banking. &quot;We're considering thepros and cons of having a banking license, but we're not surewhether there is an advantage in having one.&quot; The possibilityof such a move was reported in Friday's American Banker. Itwould be part of a trend among banks to increase theirbusiness with existing private banking clients and to attractnew customers.   Continental Bank Corp. recently opened private bankingoffices in Miami while J.P. Morgan andamp; Co. applied for a thriftcharter in Florida to expand its private banking unit there.   Also, Citicorp and Bank of New York Co. have takensimiliar steps opening separate offices for their wealthyclients in more affluent areas of Manhattan. &quot;We want tofurther strengthen our activity in New York City,&quot; said DavidKilbride, division head of custom banking for Bank of NewYork. &quot;We see a lot of potential here both in deposits andloans&quot; for the wealthy. A typical private banking customerhas at least $250,000 in annual income and $1 million ininvestable assets.   The rush for the account books of the affluent has beenparticularly intense of late as banks, with their commerciallending business drying up, look for alternative ways togenerate profits.   Private banking, as it's called, has been one of the mostlucrative businesses for banks since its inception in the1970s. Citicorp, for example, made more than $150 million inprofit last year from private banking, representing more than33% of its total earnings. And &quot;it's growing at a faster ratethan any of our other financial businesses,&quot; said EdwardMontero, division executive of the private banking group forCiticorp. The group manages some $60 billion in assets.   But banks, until recently, have relied on the traditionalmethod of providing private banking services through bankrepresentatives who visit clients and work on their accountsfrom far-flung headquarters. That has limited banks fromoffering other types of banking services in addition to assetmanagement and investment advice.   The banks believe private banking offices, much likebranches but better staffed with senior level managers, willbe able to provide greater service and attract more clients.That, in turn, creates more revenue fees and increasesprofits.   Opening offices in California and Florida has been ofparticular interest to money-center and regional banks.California, for example, has 10% of the nation's wealth, saidChase's Ms. Talbot. &quot;It's a very large portion of the wealthmarket.&quot;   David Palmer, a private banking consultant, believes theinability to provide full private banking services in certainstates has kept banks like Chase from attracting as manyclients as they would like. &quot;Several banks operating withouta banking franchise have found that to be a distinctdisadvantage,&quot; he said.</TEXT></DOC>
