In6 cases the preoperative diagnosis proved to be wrong at operation. In18 cases with confirmed diagnosis MR proved more sensitive than CT, whereasin the 6 cases with wrong diagnosis both methods proved to be of equalsensitivity. It is concluded that MR is superior to CT for the evaluationof pituitary microadenomas, provided that high-field and special examinationtechniques including thin, overlapping sections and enhancement withGD-DTPA are used.</TEXT></DOC>
