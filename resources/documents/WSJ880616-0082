White (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> F GM GMH GE </CO><IN> ARO TEL </IN><TEXT>   Ford Motor Co.'s aerospace unit won an important round in a four-way competition for a civilian satellite contract that could be worth as much as $1 billion.    The International Telecommunications Satellite Organization, or Intelsat, said its board of governors authorized the agency's staff to negotiate a contract to buy three to five satellites from Ford Aerospace Corp., with options to buy an unspecified number of additional satellites through 1994. Industry sources say as many as nine satellites could be purchased as part of the Intelsat VII series, which is expected to be the largest single civilian satellite pact since the $785 million Intelsat VI program of the early 1980s.    If Intelsat Director General Dean Burch can't strike a deal with Ford Aerospace and its major partners, Alcatel Espace of France and Mitsubishi Electric Co. of Japan, he will negotiate with a French aerospace company, Matra, an Intelsat spokesman said.    The Intelsat spokesman said Ford was the first choice because it &quot;had the best combination of price, specifications and delivery date.&quot; The organization wants to launch the first Intelsat VII in mid-1992, he added.    &quot;We're delighted,&quot; a Ford spokeswoman said. Ford is completing work on the $600 million Intelsat V contract, and if it clinches the Intelsat VII agreement would transfer workers from Intelsat V and other projects that are winding down into the new program, she said.    The two losers in the chase for the contract are General Motors Corp.'s Hughes Aircraft Co. unit and a unit of General Electric Co. Hughes is completing work on the Intelsat VI contract, which was awarded in 1982.    Ford Aerospace's success in the Intelsat VII contest comes within a month of reports that a federal grand jury in Washington, D.C., is investigating alleged payments by the unit to consulting firms with links to two former top Intelsat officials. The same grand jury is also investigating whether former officials of Hughes Aircraft knowingly participated in diversion of payments through certain consulting firms to the same officials. The investigation is unrelated to the Intelsat VII bidding.    One source familiar with the Intelsat VII contract said Intelsat was concerned about the shadow cast by the investigation, but went ahead after Ford and Hughes provided assurances there would be no recurrence of the kind of activities now under investigation.    Neither of the two former Intelsat officials has been charged with criminal wrongdoing in connection with satellite contracts.    Ford Aerospace has denied any wrongdoing. GM officials said last month they conducted an internal investigation at Hughes and concluded that the unit and its present employees did nothing wrong in dealings with Intelsat. Hughes' former chairman and chief executive officer, Albert D. Wheelon, who retired suddenly in early May after he was mentioned in a subpoena served on Hughes by the Intelsat grand jury, has made no public comment on the investigation.    In New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Ford Motor stock closed at $53, up 50 cents. GM Class H stock, which represents a dividend interest in the earnings of the unit that includes Hughes, closed at $30, up 62.5 cents. GE closed at $43.50, off 25 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
