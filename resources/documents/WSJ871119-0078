In Mexico's dual exchange-rate system, about 20% of all currency transactions are carried out on the free market, mostly by tourists and exchange houses along the U.S. border. A central bank official said the bank didn't intend to accelerate the pace of the slow peso devaluations it has been making in the much larger controlled market, which is the one used by most businesses for foreign trade.    However, some analysts said the central bank may be forced to close the gap between the free and controlled exchange rates. &quot;I think we'll begin to see bigger jumps in the controlled rate and, at the same time, a decline in the free rate,&quot; said Carlos Petersen, an official at Operadora de Bolsa, a Mexican brokerage firm. &quot;I'd expect them to meet somewhere under 2,000.&quot;    As the rate of pesos per dollar increases, the Mexican currency's value declines. The controlled rate, which has been climbing steadily through the slow devaluations, stood at 1,723 pesos to a dollar yesterday. Mexican bankers and exchange-house operators said the free-market peso rate, which was quoted late Tuesday at 1,715 pesos to one dollar, shot up at some exchanges yesterday to as much 2,700 pesos per dollar.    Analysts said the plunge of the peso's value on the free market would hurt already hard-pressed U.S. retailers along the Mexican border as they prepare for the normally bustling holiday season. Texas retailers, who are more dependent on Mexican trade than businesses farther west, will receive the hardest blow.    &quot;The retail sector is going to get hit on the head,&quot; said Donald Shuffstall, a senior vice president at MBank, a subsidiary of MCorp., in El Paso.    The Mexican stock market, meanwhile, reacted by jumping a record 26.5%, paced by strong gains by companies that have assets in dollars or precious metals rather than pesos. &quot;The exchange-rate panic seems to have driven off the stock-market panic,&quot; said Timothy Heyman, head of research at Estrategia Bursatil, a brokerage firm.    Demand for dollars on the free market, and evidently capital flight, have increased in recent days, reflecting the battering of the local stock market -- which until yesterday had lost about 70% of its value in the past month -- and concerns about government estimates of continued high inflation for 1988. A central bank official said the government decided to stop using its currency reserves to support the free-market exchange rate and informed the banks of its decision yesterday morning. &quot;We don't want to use our chips unnecessarily,&quot; an official of the central bank said.    The Mexican stock exchange, which had been the fastest-growing exchange in the world during 1987's first nine months, has fallen farther than any other market since last month's crash on Wall Street. Meanwhile, in a recent preview of the 1988 federal budget, the government projected inflation of 95%. Inflation currently is running at an annual rate of about 140%.    &quot;In this country, people have a very Pavlovian reaction,&quot; said an official from the central bank. &quot;When they get scared, they buy dollars.&quot; He said he expects investors to calm down in the next few days and the free-market exchange rate to ease back down as they do.    The decision to allow the peso's value to fall to its market rate represents something of a gamble both economically and politically for the Mexican government. Because of increased confidence in the country's economic direction before share prices collapsed, Mexicans have repatriated approximately $3 billion in capital over the past 18 months. This has helped Mexico build its foreign-exchange and gold reserves to about $16 billion, the highest level of any Latin debtor.    While the central bankers are trying to preserve those reserves by declining to support the peso, the psychological effect of the sudden drop in the peso's value could trigger more capital flight and a further drain of reserves. &quot;A lot depends on whether a panic mentality sets in,&quot; said a U.S. banker in Mexico City. Today &quot;will be an important indicator,&quot; he said.    Lawrence Brainard, a senior vice president and international economist at Bankers Trust Co. in New York, said: &quot;Lesser developing-country stock markets are still extremely vulnerable to questions of confidence, stability and questions over the continuity of domestic economic policy in the face of a changing political background.&quot;    &quot;The markets became concerned about the political viability of maintaining policies which had been successful up to now,&quot; said Mr. Brainard.    Yesterday's central bank move likely will weaken the ruling Partido Revolucionario Institucional, or PRI, as it prepares for next year's presidential election. Analysts said opposition parties are sure to try to exploit the peso's plunge in their campaigns against the PRI's presidential candidate, former Budget Minister Carlos Salinas de Gortari. The nomination of Mr. Salinas, the architect of current economic policies, as the PRI candidate earlier this year met with widespread dissatisfaction from labor groups concerned about the likelihood of continued austerity measures. &quot;This is a blow to the ruling party as it faces the election year,&quot; said Sidney Wise, editor of a newsletter on investing in Mexico. The PRI's candidate has never lost a presidential election.    In Washington, officials were following the peso's plunge but taking a calm view of it. &quot;They could've done without it. We could've done without it,&quot; one U.S. official said of the peso's collapse. &quot;But that's not quite the same as saying we're pushing the panic button.&quot;    ---   Michael R.
