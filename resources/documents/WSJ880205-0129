The report was written by Hees International Corp. following a four-day review of National Business's financial affairs. Hees, a Toronto management and investment concern, was hired last week to manage National Business after its president and chief executive officer, and its chief financial officer resigned. The company's board disclosed last week that it found &quot;unauthorized&quot; securities transfers.    The Hees report said four banks could declare National Business in default of 19 million Canadian dollars ($15 million) of debt because it failed to maintain certain financial standards set by the loan agreement. Hees said it recently met with the four banks and &quot;we continue to enjoy their confidence.&quot;    If banks did declare the company in default, however, such an action would enable seven U.S. insurance firms to force repayment of $80 million in senior notes issued by National Business last September, the report said. Hees urged National Business to meet immediately with the insurance companies, including Prudential Insurance Co. of America, to &quot;avoid precipitous action&quot; by them in light of the recent issue of the notes.    National Business is a Toronto maker of plastic transaction cards, such as credit and identification cards. In trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday the company's stock resumed trading after a four-day halt and plunged 8.75 dollars to close at 3.50 dollars.    The Hees report said National Business had a net deficit in its cash flow after it &quot;seriously eroded&quot; by 44 million dollars from positive cash flow of 25 million dollars last October. The report said the 19 million dollar loan was borrowed to cover some of the cash-flow deficit and a full explanation for the erosion is still being sought.    The report also detailed a number of financial problems at National Business, which it said indicates &quot;possible revenue overstatements, the need for asset write-downs and . . . more conservative accounting policies.&quot;    National Business's asset value could decline because of an &quot;unauthorized transfer&quot; of 10 million dollars of the company's government treasury bills to a third party, which wasn't identified, the report said. The company is uncertain as to how much of the money can be recovered. It also outlined about 13 million dollars in &quot;revenue overstatements&quot; and &quot;improper billings&quot; for products and distribution rights.    National Business had reported a profit of 14.2 million dollars, or 85 cents a share, on revenue of 189.6 million dollars for its fiscal year ended Sept. 30, but it said it is withdrawing the statement and a new report should be issued shortly.    Ontario securities regulators are in discussions with National Business and the company has retained accounting firm Thorne Ernst andamp; Whinney Inc. and a Toronto legal firm to work with its auditors, Price Waterhouse.    Timothy Casgrain, a Hees managing director, has been named president and chief executive to succeed Clive Raymond. Hees said Mr. Raymond cooperated with its review, but former chief financial officer Paul Trennum refused to meet with it. Messrs. Casgrain, Raymond and Trennum were unavailable for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
