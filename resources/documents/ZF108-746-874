Barristers,who simply wait for cases to be brought to them, have little timeto study developing areas of law.andP;  Publications that cover legaldevelopments affecting the computing industry are usually read bycomputer professionals rather than legal professionals.andP;  Britaindoes not have a written Constitution, but some call for theadoption of one.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Legal IssuesUnited KingdomComputer CrimesCopyrightPublishing IndustryBooks.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>For as long as I can recall, journalism in my part of the world has beendominated by a certain daily columnist.andP;  Time was when the survival of apaper could be virtually guaranteed by his presence in its pages, so it isn'tsurprising that he was once the subject of fierce bidding wars between SanFrancisco's two major dailies, and jumped from one to the other a coupletimes.andP;  At the height of his popularity, though, he still elicited groansfrom even his most devoted readers when he regaled us with the tediousdetails of his most recent vacation.andM;I have no intention of emulating this gentleman by inflicting upon you anyimpressions of hotels, restaurants, or tourist attractions.andP;  Nevertheless,there's a good deal to be gained by escaping-even temporarily-thespecifically American context that envelops our concepts of such things ascomputer law.andP;  Foremost, it's useful to be reminded that, all the currentlyfashionable patter about the Global Village notwithstanding, the world stillremains a highly compartmentalized place.andM;I was out of the country for five weeks' time, all of which was spent inBritain.andP;  The first-and in some ways, the most jarring-impression to registerwas that, as far as the British media are concerned, America scarcely exists.andO;To be sure, the tabloids buzz with chatter concerning international film andpop-music personalities, while the serious papers concern themselves with thestill considerable impact of American foreign policy on local affairs.andP;  Forthe most part, though, one has to hunt up a copy of the Paris Herald Tribunein order to glean information about what's transpiring on the other side ofthe Atlantic.andM;The topic of computing, however, seems to be an exception.andP;  For instance, TheGuardian periodically publishes a comprehensive spread under the headingCOMPUTER&quot; that contains a good deal of US-related material.andP;  And during mystay, the serious dailies did take brief note of San Francisco Federal JudgeVaughan Walker's trial-level coup de grace to Xerox Corp.'s lawsuit againstApple Computer Inc. In that suit, discussed in more detail in Vol.andP;  8, No.andO;5, Xerox in essence sought a judicial determination that it, and not Apple,was the creator-and owner-of the Macintosh user interface.andM;Judge Walker had handed down a preliminary ruling in March that tossed outXerox's asserted causes of action intended to cancel Apple's copyrightregistrations, and also those contending that Apple was guilty of unfaircompetition and unjust enrichment.andP;  This left only that portion of the suitseeking a declaratory judgment to the effect that Xerox was the sole owner ofthe concepts covered by its copyrights on the Star workstation.andM;In connection with this remaining cause of action, Xerox claimed thatpotential licensees of its Star technology were hesitant to enter intoagreements with the company because of Apple's ownership claims regarding theMacintosh graphic interface.andP;  The judge initially gave Xerox time todemonstrate that it could make a prima facie showing that other companieswere in fact refusing to deal with it for this reason; in May he finallyruled that it had not succeeded in doing so.andM;At the time of Judge Walker's March ruling, Xerox indicated that it intendedto appeal, but it couldn't do so until the judge had ruled on the remainingcause of action.andP;  Now that this has occurred, the way is clear for Xerox toseek a review of all of Judge Walker's rulings by the 9th Circuit Court ofAppeals as of this writing, however, there has been no announcement that anappeal has been filed).andM;On its home turf, the UK press is giving considerable play to an&quot;anti-hacking&quot; law that's currently working its way through Parliament.andP;  Thelegislation came in for a roasting at the recent conference of the Britishand Irish Legal Technology Association (BILETA) -a group chiefly composed ofteachers of law.andP;  The &quot;hacking&quot; bill is criticized for its implicitassumption that a &quot;Computer&quot; must necessarily be a mainframe, making thelegislation's definitions so vague that it could conceivably be said toprohibit hacking into a video recorder.andP;  On the other hand, if thelegislation should be interpreted by the courts so as to limit itsapplication to the literal misappropriation of text, mischievous acts such asthe insertion of viruses and worms could be left completely unchecked.andM;But the Association's concerns don't end with the proposed &quot;hacking&quot; law.andO;The members point out that most UK legislation--existing or proposed-that isapplicable to computing is tied to 1960s technology.andP;  For example, a contractcan now be entered into via electronic data interchange, without any paperever being exchanged; but under existing laws, how would it be possible toprove that a contract has in fact been made? And when would it be deemed tohave been made? In the view of the Association's members, British laws arenot adequate to deal definitively with such questions.andP;  (If I may comment,I'm not sure that existing US laws are, either.)andM;My curiosity was whetted by this exposure to British concerns regarding lawscovering computing, and I arranged for a barrister friend to take me to amajor legal bookseller's shop located at Lincoln's inn.andP;  Although the stockdisplayed in this labyrinthine establishment was enormours, when I got to thesection reserved for books on computer law I was surprised at the paucity oftitles offered.andP;  There was a sprinkling of volumes devoted to exceedinglyspecialized applications of intellectual law, but I found only one overviewof the laws pertaining to the protection of software, and that had beenpublished  way back in 1981-eons ago, in computer-law terms.andP;  (Its sectionson the status of US patent and copyright laws relating to softwareprotection, for instance, are now hopelessly outdated.) Had I been in acomparable establishment in the US, I would most likely have found a greatdeal more material on this subject.andM;At this point I must interpolate an explanation of a feature of the Britishlegal system that's unfamiliar to many Americans: unlike the US, where anindividual lawyer can conduct an off ice practice and also appear in court,in Britain these two functions are separated.andP;  If one needs to consult alawyer, one seeks a solicitor, who gives advice, draws up contracts, andgenerally does the things that US lawyers do in their offices for clients.andO;However, if it turns out that some sort of major court proceeding will beinvolved, the solicitor must refer the matter to a barrister, for onlybarristers may appear before a judge of British superior courts of law.andM;Although members of both of these distinct groups possess legal training, thestatus of barristers is considered to be distinctly higher than that ofsolicitors, even though solicitors may make more money.andP;  (Barristers, likeother court functionaries, get to wear wigs and robes in court-but any viewerof Rumpole of the Bailey knows that.) Solicitors' offices can be found justabout anywhere-often above shops on busy commercial streets-but barristershang out in the Inns of Court.andP;  The Temple is the most famous of these, butGray's Inn and Lincoln's Inn (site of that bookstore) are also venerable.andO;Thus insulated in their Inns from the crass outside world, the barristersmust sit and wait for cases to be brought to them.andM;It's been suggested to me that this difference in the way the British and USlegal professions are structured might have something to do with the dearthof current works on computer law in the bookshop I visited.andP;  The store'slocation in the midst of the Inns of Court would indicate that barristerslikely compose a major part of its clientele, and barristers have more thanenough tasks to occupy their time without going to the trouble to read aboutdeveloping areas of law from which they may never be sent a case.andP;  Thenagain, I may simply have caught the store on a day when the stock was low.andM;There are, of course, British publications that regularly cover legaldevelopments affecting the computing industry, both in the UK and abroad.andO;But these, so far as I'm aware, tend to be read by professionals in thecomputing field, and have only a limited readership outside it.andP;  Thesepublications, therefore, are not likely to have much impact on the sort ofproblems deplored by the BILETA.andM;Another difference between the British and American legal frameworks is soobvious that I hesitate to mention it: unlike Britain, the US has a writtenConstitution.andP;  This has a greater bearing on the status of computer law thanone might think at first glance.andP;  To illustrate-I ran a search for the word&quot;Constitution&quot; on a sequence of ten past &quot;Rules of the Game&quot; columns and cameup with positive results on about half of them.andP;  Because the US has thispermanent set of fundamental rules, if the law otherwise provides no answersthen there's always due process of law, or the Commerce Clause, or the FirstAmendment-some provision of the Constitution-that can help fill the gap.andP;  Ofcourse, a number of the concepts etched in our Constitution are alsoincorporated in British law, but they can be overriden by legislation orcourt decisions, and their application is not always as clear.andM;In past years many British intellectuals-and some Europeans as well-tended totake a rather condescending view of our perceived need for a writtenConstitution.andP;  That appears to have changed, if the full-page advertisementsin the British newspapers calling for the adoption of just such a documentare any indication.andP;  In general, the asserted need for a bill of rightsreceives the most emphasis, both in the papers and in the material beingdistributed on London streets, but the proposals extend to a set of basiccommercial ground rules as well.andP;  What influence this movement may ultimatelyhave is something that 1, as an American, have no grounds to speculate on,but it's an interesting development nonetheless.andM;In the end, I couldn't escape the feeling that the future course of the lawsgoverning the computing industry in Britain will most likely end up beingdetermined not in Westminister or the Law Courts, but within the evolvingeconomic and legal framework of the European Community.andP;  There are alreadysome beginnings in this direction.andP;  A European Patent Office based in Munichnow has authority to grant patents that cover all the participating Europeancountries-including the UK-named in a patent application.andP;  Though thisauthority has not supplanted the individual nations' patent offices so far,it will clearly be a great convenience for a company wishing to makecommercial use of some innovation throughout Europe.andM;As the British media amply reflect, a good many Brits still do not regardthemselves as European in any sense.andP;  But the process of integration seems tohave acquired a momentum of its own, and it doesn't appear that Mrs. Thatcheror any other prime minister can do much more than delay the inevitable.andP;  Oh,sure, a good deal of fun is being made at the expense of press baron RobertMaxwell's newly launched paper-grandiosely called The European-but, kick andcomplain though they may, the British are visibly being pulled a littledeeper into the new Continental order each day.andP;  Certainly, the achievementof a common European set of legal ground rules to cover intellectual propertyand commercial transactions will benefit the computing community, possiblebruises on the British national psyche notwithstanding.andM;Glenn Groenewold is a California attorney who devotes his time to writing andlecturing on computer law He also has served as an administrative law judge.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
