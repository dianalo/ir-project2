But the failure to respond quickly would have showna lack of leadership,'' said John Geldermann, chairman of theMerc's Special Committee to Review Trading Practices.   Geldermann also is chairman of the Merc's Board of Governors, towhom the recommendations are submitted for a decision expectedwithin 60 days.   Dual trading enables a trader on the exchange to deal for hisown account as well as customers' accounts. While the practice islegal, many consider it a problem because it allows traders toallocate profitable deals to their own accounts and dump losingtrades on customers.   Proponents argue that dual trading increases liquidity becausetraders can continue doing business when they don't have outsideorders.   But the Merc committee, recognizing the public perception thatthe practice trading invites abuse, recommended dual trading bebanned from futures contracts in cases where market volume is greatenough to ensure liquidity.   The panel also recommended the Merc's fulltime floorsurveillance team be doubled from four to eight staff members andsaid the exchange's disciplinary committees should include a personwho is not a Merc member.   ``It's hardly cynical to say that they're hoping to act inadvance of the government,'' Daniel Siegel, a professor atNorthwestern University's Kellogg Graduate School of Business, saidin an interview a day before the recommendations were formallyreleased.   ``Frankly, I suspect the leadership at the Merc is upset by someof the revelations coming out of the probe. Remember also that thefutures industry has prospered with self-regulation and they wouldlike to keep control,'' Siegel added.   The nine-member committee was appointed in late January,following disclosure the federal government was investigatingallegations that as many as 100 brokers at the Merc and the ChicagoBoard of Trade systematically cheated investors out of millions ofdollars through illegal trading practices.   Although as many as 200 subpeonas reportedly have been issued totraders and firms at the world's two largest futures exchanges, noindictments have been issued thus far.   Among the members of the Merc committee are Leo Melamed,chairman of the executive committee of the Merc and special counselto the exchange's Board of Governors; and Susan Phillips, whoformerly headed the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, thefederal agency that regulates the industry.   Shortly after it was assembled, the committee asked RobertWilmouth, president of the National Futures Association, to assistin its review of trading practices. The NFA is the industry's chiefwatchdog organization.   The exchanges have successfully fought off repeated attempts forincreased regulation in the past, most recently after the 1987stock market crash. At the time, some critics blamed the futuresexchanges for market volatility that may have worsened the crash.   But the exchanges, in a successful effort to forestall moregovernment intervention, argued that futures selling actuallyprovided an outlet that prevented the crash from getting worse.</TEXT></DOC>
