Police, meanwhile, said they had arrested another student leader.   Leading party theorists gathered to praise senior leader DengXiaoping's contributions to party theory in yet another sign of thegrowing official reverence being given the 84-year-old leader sincehe ordered the June crackdown on the student-led protests.   Officials also reported the executions of 18 convicted thievesor robbers, but said the crimes were not connected with theprotests.   Xinhua said Wan Runnan, whose computer company, the Stone GroupCo., was nicknamed the IBM of China, was expelled from the partyand fired as Stone chairman and president. He fled China after thecrackdown.   Wan, 43, founded Stone in 1984 and built it into China's leadingcomputer manufacturer and a model of Western-style managementtechniques. He epitomized the pre-crackdown reform dream of privateentrepreneurs turning ideas and know-how into cash.   Xinhua said Wan ``plotted, fanned and directly joined in therecent ... counterrevolutionary rebellion.'' After the governmentimposed martial law in Beijing on May 20 to quell the protests,Stone's research institute collected signatures from members of thenational legislature, calling for an emergency session to discussending martial law.   Wan was the most prominent businessman involved in the democracymovement, but many small private tradesmen supported it quietly bydonating food, drinks and other supplies to the student protesters.   Two other dissidents, academics Yan Jiaqi and Bao Zunxin, wereexpelled from the party Wednesday and dismissed from their researchposts. Yan also has fled China, where there is a warrant for hisarrest; Bao is believed to be in jail.   Police in the southeastern city of Guangzhou confirmed they hadarrested Zheng Xuguang of the Beijing Space and AeronauticsUniversity, bringing to seven the number of student leadersconfirmed in custody from a national most-wanted list of 21.   The police, contacted by telephone, said they arrested Zheng,20, last month but could not give other details. Hong Kong's WenWei Po newspaper, which often has reliable reports on mainlandaffairs, said Zheng was traced by following a Hong Kong travelerwho was found to be carrying a foreign passport with Zheng'spicture. Zheng apparently hoped to use the fake passport to escape.   Guangzhou is about 60 miles west of Hong Kong, and is a majortransit point for people going to and from the British enclave. Twostudents on the most-wanted list, Wu'er Kaixi and Li Lu, whoescaped to the West did so through Hong Kong, as did several olderdissidents.   Police have refused to comment on reports that the No. 1 studenton the wanted circular, Wang Dan of Beijing University, wasarrested.   There have been no reports that any of the arrested studentshave been tried.   Eighteen people were executed Wednesday in Guangzhou, accordingto the city Intermediate People's Court, but their crimes of theftor robbery were not related to the protests.   About 50 non-political executions have been reported in the pasttwo months. Executions in China are carried out with a bullet tothe back of the head.   Xinhua, meanwhile, said top party researchers and regional partyofficials took part in a four-day seminar on Deng's``party-building theory'' in the northeastern city of Harbin. Thereport said they concluded it was ``of great significance'' tostudy Deng's theory, which the theorists said had enriched anddeveloped the theory of revolutionary leader Mao Tse-tung. Xinhuadid not explain Deng's theory.   Mao long has been heralded as China's chief contributor toMarxist theory. The new attention to Deng's role as a theoristcomes as the entire nation is being required to study his June 9speech in which he praised the army for crushing the studentprotests.   Although Deng was recognized as the final arbiter of partypolicy, before the crackdown he had maintained a relatively lowprofile, appearing in public infrequently and rarely being quotedin the media. Since the crackdown, however, newspapers are full ofadmonitions to study his works, and a major movie about his earlyrevolutionary career has been released.</TEXT></DOC>
