<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-26-1263 </DOCNO><TEXT>A review of a modern state of the theory and experiments on reactionswith quasi-molecular state production has been made. The main attentionhas been paid to the /sup 12/C+/sup 12/C system being the most invetigatedone both from the theoretical and experimental points of view. Characteristicfeatures of near-Coulomb resonances, of resonances above the Coulombbarrier are considered. A comparison analysis of existing theoreticalmodels has been performed. Among them are: spectroscopical ones, thecollective model included, group approaches and calculations of low-lyingspectra in the microscopic basis; dynamical ones, beginning from phenomenologicalmodels and ending with methods using simplified versions of microscopictheories. Conclusions which can be reached by analyzing a modern stateof experimental studies of quasi-molecular resonance are summed up.</TEXT></DOC>
