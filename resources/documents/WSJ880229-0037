The IRS said it is particularly concerned about U.S. companies that briefly own high-yield stocks, then claim a 70% tax exemption for dividend income from those stocks. &quot;We are aware of a number of abuses in this area,&quot; said Dan Breen, a financial-product specialist at the IRS. &quot;Some of these trades don't have an investment purpose.&quot;    Corporations have been allowed some sort of tax exemption on dividend income for many years and various &quot;dividend capture&quot; investment strategies have been marketed since at least 1984. But the practice has drawn more scrutiny the past few months as high-yielding stocks are coming in for frenzied trading around their dividend-record dates.    On Friday Philadelphia Electric Co. alone accounted for more than 10% of total New York Stock Exchange volume, just before declaring its dividend today. On Jan. 25, a record 65.9 million shares of a single stock -- Southern Co. -- changed hands, just before the utility declared its dividend. Some 15% of Big Board trading this year has involved a few dozen high-yield stocks around their dividend-record dates, according to an analysis by Knight-Ridder Tradecenter.    Part of this volume flurry is attributed to Japanese life-insurance companies, which seek dividend income for their own reasons. But traders say anywhere from $2 billion to $5 billion or more of U.S. corporate cash is being used to trade high-yield stocks for their dividends.    Under the U.S. tax code, corporations must hold such stocks for at least 46 days to qualify for the dividend exclusion. Dividend-capture specialists, such as Wharton Asset Management in New York, say they scrupulously adhere to that time frame.    But trading analysis by Georgeson andamp; Co., a New York investor-relations firm, shows that more rapid trading is common. &quot;Typically, shares start to move (out of banks' custodial accounts) about two weeks before the dividend-record date, then return about a week after the dividend date,&quot; says Richard Wines, a Georgeson vice president.    Mr. Breen said the IRS is considering issuing a ruling soon on dividend-capture strategies. He wouldn't say whether this involves tougher enforcement of the 46-day period for tax exemptions, or spelling out limits on the hedging techniques investors can use to lock in returns regardless of what the market does.    As for the Japanese, their role may diminish in September. Currently, Japanese insurers need dividend income to pay to policyholders, since capital-gains payouts often aren't allowed. Thus, insurers have rushed to buy high-yield stocks from U.S. pension funds just before the dividend payment, and resell them right afterward.    But Japan's Ministry of Finance is believed to be considering giving insurers more flexibility in policyholder payouts. That would reduce the need for dividend income from U.S. stocks. Among big Japanese insurers, Dai-Ichi Mutual Life Insurance Co. says it doesn't do dividend-capture investing. Other Japanese insurers acknowledge some trading, but say it has scaled down. </TEXT></DOC>
