But a scattering of boos has arisen from holders of TWA bonds because the transaction would boost debt of the already highly leveraged airline to $2.5 billion from $1.9 billion.    Many of the holders of about $315 million in equipment trust certificates say they won't go along with the current buyout terms. Their appoval is needed for a dividend that would return Mr. Icahn his $440 million investment in TWA.    While their opposition isn't expected to derail the entire transaction, it could force Mr. Icahn to make some changes. It also complicates his effort to finance the transaction with an $800 million private bond placement currently being marketed by his investment banker, Drexel Burnham Lambert.    The flap also shows how a canny operator such as Mr. Icahn can leave even supposedly sophisticated bond buyers feeling flummoxed.    &quot;We're just not granting our consent,&quot; said bond analyst Don Keller of the Keystone Custodian Funds in Boston, which manages $2.5 billion in junk bonds and holds $20 million, or about 10%, of a 14 1/4% TWA certificate maturing in 1996. &quot;The terms just aren't favorable enough.&quot;    Holders say the bonds, issued in the first half of 1986, have been trading at about 105, or 5% above their original issue price. Mr. Icahn can buy the bonds back at 100. But holders say that if he gets holders to approve waivers of certain bond indentures, they could drop to between 80 and 90 in value.    As an inducement to get bondholder approvals, Mr. Icahn is offering $50 of TWA travel vouchers for every $1,000 par value of bonds. That's an offer many holders said they can easily refuse. &quot;I don't travel that much,&quot; said John Nickol, president of the Foothill Group, a finance company that also owns the bonds.    Ben Trosky, a bond manager at Merrill Lynch Asset Management, noted that ticket income can't be distributed to holders of Merrill mutual funds that own the TWA bonds. &quot;I can guarantee you I will not sign,&quot; he says. &quot;I'm in the securities business, I'm not in the travel business.&quot;    Some holders say such vouchers are only worth about 50% of face value in the resale market.    Mr. Trosky also questioned &quot;whether the airline business is an appropriate one to do a leveraged buy-out on.&quot; If Mr. Icahn gets the needed waiver and the bonds trade below 100, he said, &quot;then I won't have been fairly compensated for the risk I took in financing this transaction originally.&quot;    Some minority holders of TWA stock, who are scheduled to vote on the refinancing at a meeting set for November, are also opposed. &quot;We're not going to consent to it,&quot; said Felix Smith, chief investment officer for the high-yield group at Putnam Management Co., whose $2.3 billion high-yield trust, the largest junk-bond mutual fund, also owns $13 million of TWA preferred stock.    Mr. Smith said that, aside from the added leverage, he is also concerned that the deal would enable Mr. Icahn to use TWA funds to acquire more companies. &quot;We don't want to open any doors. We want a pure airline play,&quot; he said. Mr. Smith said Drexel has asked him about buying some of the new TWA bonds, but he isn't interested.    However, Mr. Icahn has already done better than expected in pulling TWA out of its nosedive by slashing costs last year and riding a much improved tourist season this year. TWA stock, after falling below 13 in early 1986, far below Mr. Icahn's approximately $20-a-share purchase price, rebounded to 32 1/4 the day before disclosure of the buy-out plan July 22.    Mr. Keller of Keystone said he believes Mr. Icahn has done &quot;a great job of working on the airline.&quot; Why is he offering the bond holders such an unpopular deal? &quot;I think he's just a business man. That's purely and simply a matter of negotiations.&quot;    Mr. Icahn and TWA wouldn't comment publicly, except to acknowledge that the ticket vouchers are only worth about 50% of their face value. However, some mainstream Wall Street analysts take a dim view of the entire adventure.    &quot;Having failed to extricate himself from his TWA investment by attracting other buyers, Mr. Icahn will further leverage an already heavily encumbered TWA in order to recover his stake,&quot; Michael Armellino of Goldman, Sachs said the morning after the buy-out announcement.    &quot;Not only is TWA highly leveraged, but the company's fleet is old and a modernization plan would be prohibitively expensive,&quot; he added. &quot;Despite the hype resulting from Icahn's focus on second-quarter operating income, which ignores interest and preferred charges, we consider TWA's earnings inadequate.&quot;    He estimates TWA will earn only $1 a share this year. He advised holders of TWA common to sell because he valued Mr. Icahn's package of cash and debentures at only $35 a share, when the stock was trading above 34. The stock has since retreated, closing yesterday at 33 1/2.    Mr. Armellino's views might be of comfort to some of Goldman's prominent corporate finance clients. They are, in the main, incumbent managements to whom Mr. Icahn's name is anathema. </TEXT></DOC>
