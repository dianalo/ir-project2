Carlucci announced suspension of payments on $1billion worth of contracts.   Carlucci's surprise action was based on information insearch-warrant affidavits unsealed by a federal magistrate inDallas on Thursday.   Carlucci, who earlier had urged caution in reacting to theinvestigation, declared at a news conference that ``wherever wehave specific evidence we will take action.''   Pentagon officials said that the impact of the suspension on thecompanies and their workers would depend on each of the scores ofcontracts involved, and possibly on the financial health of thecompany.   Carlucci also announced that the Pentagon was beginningsuspension procedures against three individuals and a company namedin the documents, and he said the Defense Department was reviewingexisting contracts with four implicated companies and freezing newcontracts on nine weapons systems.   ``The Navy has initiated suspension procedures with respect toGeorge Stone, Mark Saunders, Joe Bradley and the ContinentalElectronics division of Varian Associates Inc.'' Varian Associateswas the 155th largest defense contractor for 1986 and its parentcompany Varian Continental received more than $81.76 million indefense awards in that year, according to the unsealed affadavit.   He said the current actions did not gravely impair nationalsecurity.   George Simpson, a spokesman for Varian Associates, said thesuspension will affect only one of Continental Electronics'military projects, developing low frequency transmitters.   Simpson says he doesn't know the value of the contract, but itrepresents ``only a very small part'' of Continental Electronics'business ``so there would be no immediate impact on the firm.''   He said the company was ``surprised and disappointed'' by thesuspension because it had been told it was not a target of theinvestigation. ``Allegations, alone, are not the basis for suchaction,'' he said.   The New York Times reported today that among the companies whosepayments have been interrupted are the Canadian Marconi Co., LittonIndustries, Bell Atlantic Corp., TRW Inc. and Lockheed Corp.   Carlucci said the Pentagon was reviewing existing contracts withfour companies named in the Dallas affidavits _ Litton, NordenSystems Inc., Hazeltine and Emhart.   Norden, based in Norwalk, Conn., is a division of UnitedTechnologies Corp., the eighth largest defense contractor in 1987with deals totalling $3.3 billion. Litton was the 14th biggest,with contracts worth $2 billion. United Technologies is based inHartford, Conn. Litton has offices in Van Nuys, Calif.   ``We do not know what the allegations are, if any, or thegovernment's basis for stopping payments,'' said Litton spokesmanJohn Thom.   Emhart spokesman Dan Barrett, said the Farmington, Conn.-basedcompany will ``comply fully and expeditiously because we'reconfident nothing improper will be found.''   ``Hazeltine continues to cooperate fully with authorities in theinvestigation,'' said a statement issued on behalf of the LongIsland, N.Y.-based company.   The largest single weapons system on which payments are beingfrozen is called the Anti-Submarine Operating Center, a $712million system of shore-based command and control centers tocoordinate efforts to locate and destroy submarines.   Saunders, one of the three individuals named by Carlucci, is aformer Navy procurement officer convicted of and fired for stocktrading on insider Navy information in 1982. The FBI said Saunderswas receiving inside contract data from Stone, his Navy successor,and it ``believes that Saunders is paying Stone for thisinformation.''   Stone is one of six Pentagon officials transferred to otherduties after their offices were searched.   The third individual named by Carlucci, Bradley, has been placedon administrative leave from his job as vice president formarketing of Varian Continental, of Palo Alto, Calif., according toa company spokesman.   Meanwhile Friday, Norden announced it had withdrawn fromcompetition on a contract to build a high-tech portable shelterused near a battlefield to control aircraft in all kinds of weather.   The company cited the need for the public and government to``have full confidence in the integrity of the ... procurementprocess.''   The other seven weapons systems on which new contract actionswere suspended are:   _The Digital Communications Terminal, a $150 million program todevelop a hand-held computerized unit to compose messages fortransmission by field radios.   _The Tactical Environmental Support System, a $58 million Navyprogram.   _A $51 million fiber optical project.   _The Digital Wideband Radio set, being developed at a cost of$49 million.   _A $38 million anti-submarine warfare electronics display unit.   _The $30 million Bancroft radio for tanks and Marine Corps lightarmored vehicles.   _A $6.3 million project to develop very low frequency and lowfrequency communications gear.</TEXT></DOC>
