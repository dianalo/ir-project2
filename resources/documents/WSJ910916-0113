At the same time, Hewlett-Packard Inc.'s 11-ounce LX95 hasproven so popular since it was introduced in April that HPhas had to add second and third shifts at its Corvallis,Ore., calculator plant to meet unexpectedly strong demand.</LP><TEXT>   Doubters may rail about conspicuous technologyconsumption, but growing numbers of companies are buying thedevices to equip field sales and service forces for less thanhalf the cost of laptop computers. They program the deviceswith crucial information and a few basic routines, such asinsurance agents' ratings systems or doctors' drugprescription guidelines.   &quot;There's been a transition from the gadget category to thebusiness tool,&quot; said Thomas E. Miller, a vice president atLink Resources Corp., a New York market research firm. &quot;Saleshave jumped more than we expected,&quot; he added.   The latest entrant from Psion may lack the U.S. marketingmuscle of HP or Sharp Corp., the Japanese maker of thepopular but less sophisticated Wizard electronic organizer.But analysts said that the Psion Series 3's $425 base price,low weight and built-in software for word processing anddatabase storage demonstrate some of the potential ofhand-held computing.   David Marshak, senior analyst at Patricia Seybold's OfficeComputing Group Inc. in Boston, said, &quot;This is getting closerto the ideal machine.&quot; He said that in mobile computing, &quot;thekey element is, do you have to ask yourself whether to takeit along? I wouldn't mind having this in my briefcase all thetime.&quot;   While the Hewlett-Packard $695 palmtop is numbers-orientedand includes a built in copy of Lotus Development Corp.'sbest-selling 1-2-3 spreadsheet, Psion chose to betext-oriented. Its word processor is compatible withMicrosoft Corp.'s Word software, so people who use Word ontheir desktop computers can transfer documents to the Psioncomputer and edit, augment or study them. &quot;We can take adocument with all its formats and move it,&quot; said AntonyRevis, president of Psion Inc., the British computercompany's Watertown, Conn., unit.   The Series 3, which can connect by cable to eitherIBM-compatible or Apple Macintosh computers, has itsdrawbacks: The constricted 58-key keyboard makes touch-typingnearly impossible, and the screen only displays eight linesof 40 characters each. On the plus side, it will run for twomonths on two AA batteries, and it's only slightly larger andtwice as thick as a checkbook.   Psion has been selling a hand-held computer with limitedfunctions since 1984, with some 700,000 installed world-wide.Customers include British retailer Marks andamp; Spencer, which has16,000 units that can be attached to electronic point-of-salesystems for inventory tracking, and Foxboro Corp., aFoxborough, Mass., process control maker that sells them asinstrument control systems.   The Series 3 is a full-fledged computer with an NEC Corp.version of Intel Corp.'s 8086 chip that powers basicIBM-compatible machines. But it uses a proprietary operatingsystem rather than Microsoft's MS-DOS. Mr. Revis said heexpects half the Series 3 sales to be in specific markets,where the computer will include special software. &quot;Many ofthose vertical applications are for thousands of units,&quot; Mr.Revis said.   HP, which has concentrated on consumer sales for itspalmtop computer, has been surprised by how much corporateinterest has appeared. &quot;We have a lot of activity at majoraccounts,&quot; said Daniel Terpack, general manager of thecompany's Corvallis plant. &quot;That's moving much faster than weexpected.&quot; HP said its European operation just closed a 1,000unit sale to Bayer AG, the German chemical company. Bayerdeclined to disclose how the computers will be used.   Sharp says sales of its Wizard to corporations forspecialized uses has increased rapidly this year. The Wizard,which costs as much as $399, depending on features, isdesigned as an electronic organizer, storing phone numbers,schedules and expenses. It doesn't have the powerfulprocessor of Psion's machine, but it's much more programmablethan a calculator, permitting software writers to produceprograms for corporate users.   Last year, Sharp signed a contract to supply 10,000Wizards to home and car insurance agents for PrudentialInsurance Co.'s property and casualty unit. Crys Rodriguez,senior computer systems analyst at Prudential, said thecompany developed a program with insurance rate informationthat could be stored on a Wizard memory card. Agents askcustomers questions, tap in answers depending on theirresponses and then the Wizard calculates the rate.&quot;Previously, we used a Sharp calculator with a one-linescreen. The problem was that insurance is getting so complexthat we couldn't fit the complexity in,&quot; she said. TheWizard, which has a larger screen and more processing power,solved the problem.   Brooklyn Union Gas Co. has developed an even moresophisticated use for the Wizard. Connie Lamicela, aprogrammer, rewrote an expert system that had been used onthe single PC in each customer payment office into a programfor Wizards that can be provided to all 40 customer paymentagents.   Utility agents must adhere to complex rules, includingdetails of Public Service Commission guidelines on designingpayment programs for late accounts. &quot;If two people come inwith the same circumstances and get different plans, we're introuble because it looks like favoritism,&quot; she explained.Using the expert system reminds them of the guidelines byautomatically showing the next question to ask, depending onprevious answers. Once a payment plan is arranged, the agentshave to fill out state-required forms by hand.   Analysts predict that more powerful palmtops such as HP'sand Psion's will find increased favor as corporateprogrammers design ways to make it easy for users to check onelectronic mail or call up data from the corporate files.David Mack, an analyst with Workgroup Technologies, aHampton, N.H., market research firm, said, &quot;Our take is thatpalmtops . . . won't replace laptops or desktops, but there'sutility in handling e-mail messages.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
