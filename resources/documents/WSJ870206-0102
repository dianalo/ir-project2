Under the plan, if the cosmetics, jewelry and health products company is acquired in a hostile takeover, holders of Avon common shares would be entitled to purchase at half the market price one share in the surviving company for each Avon share they held. A company spokesman said he didn't know of any companies pursuing Avon.    &quot;The rights guard against partial tender offers and other abusive tactics buyers may use to gain control of Avon holders,&quot; Hicks Waldron, Avon's chairman and chief executive officer said.    He added, &quot;The rights are intended to enable all Avon shareholders to realize the long-term value of their investment in the company. They do not prevent a takeover, but should encourage anyone seeking to acquire the company to negotiate with the board prior to attempting a takeover.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
