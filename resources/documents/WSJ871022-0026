But it is developing anyway.    Speculators in stock-index futures are facing huge losses and may default on their contracts. That would send shock waves into the stock market and could devastate Hong Kong's reputation as a financial center.    Meanwhile, the colony's unit-trust industry, which has undergone an unprecedented boom over the past five years, faces a potential bust next week when trading in Asian funds resumes. The unit trusts are similar to mutual funds in the U.S.    Unless world markets recover strongly and quickly, many managers say, a wave of redemptions is possible. The viability of some smaller trusts, they fear, could be threatened if enough investors bail out.    When financial markets were closed here, the futures market had 87,400 contracts outstanding, with a value of 15.7 billion Hong Kong dollars ($2 billion).    Stock futures are contracts that commit investors to buy or sell shares, thus allowing them to bet on whether share prices will rise or fall.    Buyers of futures contracts face huge losses. The Hang Seng index, as computed in the futures market, closed Monday at between 3,529 and 3,695 after dropping 300 points or more. By then, many of the buyers already had difficulty meeting margin calls, or demands from their brokers for more cash to cover their positions.    These losers were mainly local brokerages and their clients, who bought the contracts on the assumption that the bull run in the local stock market would continue. The sellers were mostly banks, as well as some local and foreign brokerages.    Such sellers typically are involved in arbitrage. They sold contracts on the futures market, where prices had been forced upward by the speculative mania, and then bought stocks at cheaper prices in the stock market, and profited from the gap. Plunging stock prices have left them with huge profits on their futures contracts, which should cover losses on their physical holdings of stock.    These profits are now at risk, because the sellers haven't received payment and a strong lobby of local brokers is pressuring the futures exchange to rule that profits belonging to the sellers of contracts should be settled only partially, or not at all.    Deprived of their covering profit, sellers of futures contracts could respond by dumping their stocks. A trader in a British brokerage in Hong Kong estimates that as much as six billion Hong Kong dollars of stocks would be dumped immediately, causing the Hang Seng index to plunge as much as 70%.    Ultimately, &quot;the banking system itself would be jeopardized,&quot; says Daniel Gressel, a fund manager for G.T. Management (Asia) Ltd. in Hong Kong.    Many local brokers are convinced that their losses -- real and theoretical -- can't be met.    Members of the Hong Kong Stock Brokers Association yesterday met to find a way out of the crisis. A majority in the association backed a proposal to settle all contracts outstanding at a price to be fixed by the futures exchange, instead of by free-market forces.    Some of the association's members wanted the settlement level for the futures market to be fixed at Monday's close, just before the suspension of trading.    Other members of the association preferred to wait until trading resumes next Monday. They say the settlement level should be fixed at the closing level of the Hang Seng index at the close of trading next Monday.    Ultimately, the Hong Kong government may have to step in to prevent financial chaos. But the government has little to say, at least for the time being. Financial Secretary Piers Jacobs said yesterday, &quot;All I can say this morning is that we're working very hard, and we'll get all the problems worked out.&quot;    ---   Russell G.
