Public Voice for Food and Health Policy said Wednesday that itsanalysis of infant health data from the nation's 332 poorest ruralcounties found that the proportion of babies born at dangerously lowweight dropped from 9.1 percent to 8.3 percent between 1975 and1980, then increased to 8.8 percent in 1985.   The study said the rate of low birthweight babies in the 332poorest counties _ those where at least one-fourth of the populationwas below the federal poverty level _ was almost 30 percent higherthan in the nation as a whole.   Low birthweight is a major cause of infant death and long-termdisability. The study said the infant mortality rate in the poorcounties was 13.6 per 1,000 live births in 1985, compared with arate of 10.6 nationally.   If the infant mortality rate in the poor rural areas had been aslow as the national average during the decade, the study said, therewould have been between 4,000 and 6,400 fewer infant deaths in thosepoor counties.   ``This country has long had one of the highest infant mortalityrates among the world's industrialized nations,'' said Rep. RoyRowland, D-Ga., the only physician in Congress and the vice-chairmanof the National Commission to Prevent Infant Mortality.   Rowland, whose district includes 13 of the 332 counties that werepart of the study, said infant health problems in rural areas havebeen worsened by Reagan administration cuts in spending on healthcare programs.   He said the problem also stems from a decline in the number ofphysicians in rural areas, a lack of transportation for pregnantwomen requiring health care, and a failure to educate poor pregnantwomen on the importance of prenatal care.</TEXT></DOC>
