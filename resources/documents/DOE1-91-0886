Observation of early seedlinggrowth indicated that partitioning of a large proportion of resourcesto the root of young Leucaena seedlings could account, in part, for theslow initial shoot growth observed in this genus. Therefore, a seriesof experiments were conducted to examine the partitioning of stored seedreserves, photosynthate, and nitrogen in developing Leucaena seedlings.The effects of nodulation and nitrogen fertilization on partitioningof nutrients in the seedling were also examined. Seed reserves were initiallyused for radicle growth in dark grown seedlings; however, partitioningsoon shifted to the hypocotyl. By four days after imbibition, hypocotylweight exceeded radicle weight in both species tested (L. leucocephalaand L. retusa), at all temperatures above 20{sup 0}C. Two experimentswere conducted examining the carbon partitioning of L. leucocephala cultivarK-8 using {sup 14}CO{sub 2} pulse labeling techniques.</TEXT></DOC>
