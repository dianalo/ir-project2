Proponents argue that multimedia systemswill soon be used widely by corporate trainers, schools andanyone making a formal presentation.</LP><TEXT>   Commodore, based in West Chester, Pa., has been strugglingfor the past year and is staking its future on the multimediacomputer market. It hopes to ride the demand for multimediasystems and get into corporate accounts, much the way AppleComputer Inc. used its Macintosh's aptitude for desktoppublishing to solidify its position in corporate America.   It won't be easy. Commodore still needs to persuade morebig dealers to carry the Amiga line. But dealers, facing thewelter of products available, are trying to reduce the numberof companies whose products they carry. Commodore faces asimilar hurdle with corporate customers trying to simplifytheir computer systems; Amiga software won't run on Macintoshor IBM-compatible machines.   In general, Commodore needs to re-establish itscredibility. It has had losses in recent quarters andpersonal computer sales are down, even in West Germany, itsstrongest market. Reflecting these problems, Commodore'sstock has tumbled 60% in the past year. In New York StockExchange composite trading yesterday, Commodore shares closedat $7.25, down 25 cents.   The machine announced at a news conference here yesterdaystacks up nicely against the competition. The Amiga 3000 usesMotorola Corp.'s powerful 68030 central processor as well assome customized chips that speed the handling of graphics andsound. The 3000 also comes with a so-called authoring systemthat makes it rather easy to pull together a multimediapresentation.   &quot;This machine is state-of-the-art,&quot; said Nick Arnett, aconsultant with Multimedia Computing Corp., Santa Clara,Calif.   With suggested retail prices of $3,299 to $4,499 --depending on the speed of the processor and the size of thehard disk -- the Amiga 3000 line also costs thousands ofdollars less than some competing systems.   Harry Copperman, who has been running Commodore's U.S.operations for the past year, said the company is makingprogress in its target markets: education, government andcorporations, mainly for use by trainers. He said existingmodels of the Amiga line now account for more than 50% ofsales.   &quot;This {turnaround} is a journey, not an event,&quot; hecautioned. But he added: &quot;Overall, we've been very pleased.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
