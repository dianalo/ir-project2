Farewell, Cold War. So long, Iron Curtain. Goodbye, Berlin Wall,a worn-out symbol disintegrating like worn-out mortar.   Adieu, freewheeling sex, made high-risk by the dread of AIDS.   Farewell, games of innocence, your boys hooked on steroids,laying bets.   So long, visions of American invincibility, held hostage byterrorists.   Godspeed, Voyager 2, mission accomplished, rocketing to where nospacecraft has gone before.   Goodbye, American Century, eclipsed by a rising Japanese sun.   Even if history worked on the decimal system, a decade like the1980s defied glib labels. But it was a dizzying, dynamic time ofnew highs and lows, worsts and firsts, advances and reversals,breakdowns and breakthroughs.   Ronald Reagan reigned. Mikhail S. Gorbachev restructured. IvanBoesky prescribed.   ``Greed is healthy,'' the doctor of arbitrage proclaimed.Money-mad Wall Streeters traded inside information illegally. BenJohnson was the fastest Olympian on steroids, turning his worldrecord medal to fool's gold. Nothing succeeded like excess in therace to have it all.   U.S. baby boomers turned fortysomething but remained in lovewith themselves and gizmos of instant gratification such as VCRs,PCs, CDs, BMWs, MTV, microwaves, fax mail, cellular phones, litebeer and Lean Cuisine.   And the Earth spun on despite an ozone hole, the greenhouseeffect, natural disasters and man-made scourges of Bhopal,Chernobyl, the Exxon Valdez, wayward garbage scows andsyringe-spattered shorelines.   Four decades of East-West tension went out of fashion, and theman who set the fashion four decades ago said it was so.Diplomat-historian George Kennan, theorist of 1940s anti-Soviet``containment,'' sat before Congress and pronounced: ``The Cold Warhas been left in the past.''   A new epoch was proclaimed by Gorbachev, ``a new world offreedom'' by President Bush.   Gorbachev took power in 1985, the fourth Soviet leader in 28months, and inherited a torpid bureaucracy and failing economy.Departing from the three aged autocrats who preceded him, Gorbachevjolted totalitarianism with ``glasnost'' and ``perestroika'':openness and restructuring.   Reagan, the former actor who was the first two-term U.S.president in a generation, called the Soviet Union an ``evilempire.'' But he later agreed to a breakthrough in arms control _destruction of a class of nuclear weapons aimed at that empire.   In Eastern Europe, history's tectonic plates shifted, and thecommunist monopoly crumbled.   The spasms of self-determination began in Poland, where foodcost so much in 1980 that Solidarity, formed under upstart Gdanskelectrician Lech Walesa, quickly gained wide popular support.   The union was outlawed and Walesa was jailed for 11 months undermartial law. But Solidarity re-emerged to force free elections, andthe union now controls the first non-communist government in theEast bloc.   Hungary dissolved its communist party and lifted the physicaland psychological barrier of the barbed-wire Iron Curtain.   An East German exodus of 225,000 people was the biggest since1961, when the Berlin Wall clamped a human hemorrhage.   The jagged scar of the wall was condemned by every U.S.president since Kennedy as the quintessential fault line of asystem that controlled people by locking them in.   On Nov. 9, 1989, the wall that 191 people died trying to crossopened, without a drop of blood shed.   Aftershocks led to new leadership in Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia.   But in China's Tiananmen Square, earlier in the year,pro-democracy student rallies were crushed by the rumble ofPeople's Army tanks. Hundreds were killed, and China later executedringleaders.   On the home front, Reagan survived a would-be assassin's bulletin 1981 to launch supply-side economics with its trickle-downtheory.   Tax breaks were welcomed by the rich. But the gap betweenAmerica's rich and poor grew, the budget deficit multiplied to $150billion, the United States became the world's largest debtornation, and the national debt neared $3 trillion. Reaganaccumulated more red ink than all of his predecessors combined.   Military spending reached record levels. The built-up Pentagon'sbiggest real-life operation: the invasion of Grenada, an islandspeck in the Caribbean.   The economy broke new ground with a seven-year expansion, butunequaled riches were balanced against an estimated 3 millionhomeless, stubborn poverty and Rust Belt woes.   America's post-World War II economic domination of the worldgave way as new economic powers arose. New York's RockefellerCenter passed from control of one of America's mightiest industrialfamilies to a Japanese bank, a transaction that symbolized the newera.   Reagan's legacy included Sandra Day O'Connor, the first womanappointed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which reopened the abortionissue over how much right a woman has to her own body.   The legacy also included a raft of scandals _ Iran-Contra, HUD,Pentagon procurement, savings-and-loans _ all inherited by Bush ashe brought the yelp of puppies, the clang of horseshoes and thequotable Dan Quayle to the White House.   Bush's well-read lips promised a kinder, gentler nation afterprospering with Willie Horton ads.   It was a decade to forget for Democrats from Jimmy Carter toMichael Dukakis. Walter Mondale partnered with Geraldine Ferraroand carried his home state of Minnesota, but lost 49 others. GaryHart teamed with Donna Rice and got ``Monkey Business.''   Jesse Jackson became the first black to win a presidentialprimary.   Those who broke the rules kept headline writers busy as Americaagonized over ethics and morals.   On Wall Street, where $25 billion takeovers became reality,crime wore fancy French cufflinks. Boesky pleaded guilty in aninsider trading scandal; junk bondsman Michael Milken was indictedfor alleged securities fraud.   In 1987, the market dropped 508 points in its worst day ever, astark comeuppance for fresh-faced MBAs who expected to have it allbut learned life and their six-figure incomes had limits.   But charity had its moments, too. Live Aid helped starvingEthiopians; Farm Aid brought relief to American farmers.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
