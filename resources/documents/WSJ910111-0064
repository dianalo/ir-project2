In the latest round of fund raising by the biggest playersin the buy-out field, Forstmann Little andamp; Co., headed byTheodore J. Forstmann, has won pledges for about $1.4 billionfrom pension funds and other institutional investors, aspokesman for the firm said. Mr. Forstmann concluded thefund-raising effort yesterday, they said.</LP><TEXT>   Meanwhile, buy-out rival Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. hasobtained commitments exceeding $800 million in its new fundraising begun late last year, according to some of itsinvestors.   KKR's effort to boost that total has stalled for themoment, as some current investors said they were seeking somerevised terms before committing more money to the buy-outfirm.   In their fund-raising efforts, at least, the two buy-outfirms seem undeterred by the growing recession, the toughclimate for buy-outs caused by the collapse of thehigh-yield, below-investment-grade &quot;junk&quot; bond market, andpublic backlash against corporate takeovers in general. In aleveraged buy-out, all of a publicly traded company's sharesare acquired by a small group that relies heavily on debtfinancing.   Mr. Forstmann argues that the current climate istailor-made for him. In his fund-raising memo, he states thatForstmann Little is &quot;able to buy higher-quality companies atprices more attractive than at any time in the firm's 12-yearhistory.&quot;   The Forstmann Little fund will be used for subordinateddebt, which the firm uses instead of junk bonds to helpfinance its deals. Investors receive 37.5% ownership in thetarget companies, as well as a current yield of onepercentage point above the yield on comparable Treasurynotes.   Mr. Forstmann &quot;has a leg up on his competitors, in that hecarries his subordinated debt with him,&quot; said Douglas Le Bon,managing director of Pinnacle Capital Management, a pensionconsulting firm. Other buy-out groups have been frustrated inmaking acquisitions by a lack of junk bonds to help financethe deals.   Mr. Forstmann's largest investors in the past haveincluded the pension funds of General Electric Co., AmericanTelephone andamp; Telegraph Co. and Boeing Co. Forstmann Littleexecutives declined to comment on participants in the latestfund, but most are believed to be repeaters.   One new investor is the Colorado state pension fund, whichsaid it committed $100 million to the new Forstmann Littlefund. The Colorado fund previously invested in buy-out fundsorganized by the Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. unit ofAmerican Express Co. and Equitable Life Assurance Society ofthe U.S.   Mr. Forstmann initially hoped to raise an additional $1.5billion when he began prospecting for more cash for newacquisitions last fall. Nevertheless, Forstmann Littleofficials decided that the $1.4 billion total was closeenough to call a success. Indeed, the new commitments doublethe $1.4 billion -- half each in the form of equity andsubordinated debt -- that Forstmann Little has left unspentfrom the firm's previous buy-out funds.   The firm's latest fund raising contrasts with a campaignbegun in late 1989, when Mr. Forstmann failed in an attemptto raise as much as $4 billion for a fund intended to takelarge positions in companies without taking them over.   KKR got off to a fast start in its new fund raising bywinning $350 million commitments from each of the statepublic employee pension funds of Oregon and Washington. Butthe firm has received only a trickle of money since then,people familiar with KKR said.   Some past KKR investors said they are delaying a decisionon whether to make new commitments, hoping that KKR willchange some of the terms of their earlier partnershipagreements, which KKR wants to continue to use. &quot;I would loveto invest in their {new} fund, because they do a good job,but these structural issues can lead to problems down theroad,&quot; said Scott Sperling, a managing director of theHarvard University endowment and an investor in earlier KKRfunds.   Several KKR investors said they are concerned that thebuy-out firm gets to keep 100% of investment banking feesthat it collects, regardless of whether investors laterprofit from the transactions.   Another sore point involves KKR's &quot;toehold&quot; investments,in which the firm buys minority stakes in publicly quotedsecurities. KKR had done well with such investments in thelate 1980s. But it fared poorly last year, incurring paperlosses of about $250 million as of last December.   Vexed by these losses, several longtime KKR investors havebeen pressing the buy-out firm to &quot;net out&quot; its overallprofits and losses before collecting its traditional 20%share of profits. These investors object to KKR's practice ofcollecting a 20% share of profits on winning investments,without adjusting for investments that go sour.   KKR declined to comment. But the firm has alwaysmaintained that each of its deals is independent of others.</TEXT></DOC>
