<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-21-0221 </DOCNO><TEXT>A survey was conducted to evaluate the utilities' perspective of the successof efforts of the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) and ownergroups for the development and implementation of advanced technology.The source of the advanced technology was the result of a joint effortbetween EPRI and two utility owner groups. The former performs genericresearch and development (R andamp; D) on behalf of its members drawn fromthe US electric utility industry. Owner groups are short-term associationsof a group of utilities, all confronted with the same problem. Managementimplications for both EPRI and the utilities are drawn from the resultsand are summarized. They include recognition that EPRI's reputation forobjectivity is an important asset that must be protected. Other implicationsinclude assessments of the merits and options for building better utility/NRCrelations and strengthening the utility/EPRI relationship. Addressingthe implications does not hinge on any major new development. Rather,it depends on EPRI and utility management making the commitment to supportefforts to increase the intensity of communication on the baseline program.The resources needed are mainly provision of adequate staff time andattendant travel expenses.</TEXT></DOC>
