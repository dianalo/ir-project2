WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Democrat Albert Gore Jr. stood in front of oneof the most powerful computers ever built and for half an hourspoke with the kind of emotion not often seen in the 1988presidential race.   He complained of the Reagan administration's ``starvation ofsuper-computing,'' and described his vision _ a nationwidefiber-optic network connecting such machines for research andbusiness, a public works project as important as the building ofinterstate highways a generation ago.   When he was done, a television reporter's first question madeGore's face sag. What, the newsman wanted to know, did theTennessee senator think of the latest polls that showed himtrailing in the presidential race.   Gore managed a chuckle and, after a pause, gave the answer hehad repeated three times before in three other cities that day:Polls are sometimes wrong.   But Gore had come to the campus of the University of Illinois inChampaign, one day before Illinois' important Democraticpresidential primary last week, to talk super-computers _ the kindthat perform millions of calculations in an instant, and whoseusefulness is more widely assumed than understood.   Gore's performance, and the staging and timing of the event,illustrate the incongruity that sometimes surfaces as he takes hiscampaign to the North.   He uses newly adopted slogans about ``working men and women,''and of bringing the Democratic Party ``back to the grass roots'' _populism that proved successful in the South.   Yet Gore often seems more inspired when the discussion turns todeeply technical issues of the sort that may not evoke muchresponse from those working men and women he seeks.   ``Super-computing will be the engine of the information age,''Gore said.   He and his audience were crowded into an antiseptic,white-floored and glass-walled room with a Cray super-computer thesize of two or three Coca-Cola machines and about as red. With himwere his wife and his father.   ``What we have seen in the last several years is the emergenceof an entirely new field of scientific inquiry _ computationalscience,'' Gore said. ``It's time we move forward to create anational infrastructure that enables us to take advantage of thatcomputational science.''   Gore, 39, was educated at Harvard, showing an intellectualcuriosity that led him to enroll in both the divinity and lawschools, finishing neither.   In 12 years as a member of the House and Senate, he immersedhimself in issues such as medical technology, organ transplants andarms control.   He gained the reputation of an arms-control specialist whoenjoys detail. On his campaign plane he talks with excitement of``unmistakeable signs,'' in Warsaw Pact troop placements of recentweeks, that the Soviets' ``basic posture is undergoingre-evaluation.''   But his claimed expertise can be a two-edged sword. RivalMichael Dukakis charged Gore ``got taken to the cleaners'' when heled Democratic negotiations with the Reagan administration overarms control and Star Wars.   There's also the possible problem of bogging down his audience _in what is, after all, a political battle _ with detail ontechnical subjects.   For example, there was his campaign statement last week reactingto reports that ozone _ a protective layer of atmosphere shieldingout harmful rays _ was disappearing faster than thought.   Gore called for an immediate ban on ``non-essential uses ofchlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)'' as propellants in aerosol sprays.Beyond that, he outlined five other steps, including ``an immediate$1 per pound assessment of the most harmful CFCs, rising to $5,''and having the president ``personally call on the leaders of Japanand Europe to ratify the Montreal protocol, and to put the issue onthe June summit.'' No explanation of that protocol, or much else,was given.   Still, in person and in the campaign statement, Gore did takecare to make broader points. The computers are keys to increasedcompetitiveness, he said. And ozone depletion raises the threat ofskin cancer.   The candidate who loves to talk technical detail became, in thecampaign press release, ``an environmental Paul Revere.''</TEXT></DOC>
