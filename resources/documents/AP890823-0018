KornerIII.   ``Miss Butler,'' Hunt responded Tuesday from the witness stand,``if you had signed as many thousands of documents as I have, youmight be as vague as I am.''   At issue are documents Hunt signed to form a 1980 partnership andto dissolve it two years later.   Hunt and his younger brothers, William Herbert and Lamar, formedthe partnership with their family's Placid Oil Co. to repay debtsfrom the silver price collapse totaling as much as $2 billion.   The brothers, whose fortunes have fallen since their investmentsin the silver market soured, are contesting more than $300 millionin 1982 taxes the IRS says are due from the dissolution of thepartnership.   The IRS contends that Nelson Bunker Hunt owes about $155 millionin 1982 taxes, and that William Herbert and Lamar owe more than $158million and $505,377 respectively.   The IRS contends the partnership was an elaborate sham to providefinancial relief to the brothers when they didn't have cash to repaytheir silver debts. After it was dissolved, the IRS says the resultwas taxable income to the brothers.   Lawyers for the Hunts, however, contend the partnership was alegitimate business and dispute that $300 million in taxes was owed.   Nelson Bunker Hunt, subpoenaed by the government, testifiedTuesday that the partnership agreement tied up all his assets,including furniture in his home, and ``made it impossible to dobusiness.''   Under the agreement, a consortium of banks loaned Placid $1.1billion, of which $824 million was contributed to the partnership torepay the silver debts. The brothers, in turn, contributed NorthDakota coal properties, silver and gold stocks.   ``I was glad to have it dissolved because it was a veryunworkable situation,'' Hunt testified.   According to testimony, the banks couldn't lend the brothersmoney directly because of a Federal Reserve ban on loans for silverinvestments imposed about the time silver prices collapsed.   The judge has ruled that testimony in the lengthy non-jury trial,in its fourth week, must conclude by Sept. 1.</TEXT></DOC>
