A judge in Hauppauge, N.Y., set bail at $500,000 for thecaptain, 20 times as much as prosecutors had recommended, saying``we have a manmade destruction that has not been equaled,probably, since Hiroshima.''   With claims against Exxon for damages escalating into themillions, U.S. Navy oil skimmers were pressed into service, andExxon accepted an offer of help from the Soviet Union.   Salvage crews pumped compressed air into the $125 million shipto float it off Bligh Reef, 25 miles from the port of Valdez. Fromthere, it began a 30-mile journey under the control of six tugs toa remote cove off Naked Island for temporary repairs, picking itsway through scattered icebergs.   The ship was refloated before tide reached its peak Wednesday.``It was not just a stroke of good luck,'' said Gary Gorski,Exxon's salvage coordinator. ``It took a lot of hard work.''   Company officials turned to the Far East in search of a dry dockwilling to accept the crippled leviathan Exxon Valdez.   As the oil off Alaska spread over 2,600 square miles, an arealarger than the state of Delaware, the fired captain of the tankerturned himself in this morning to authorities in Hauppauge, N.Y.   Joseph Hazelwood, who lives on New York's Long Island, appearedwith his attorney 12 days after his ship ran aground and nearly aweek after the National Transportation Safety Board said testsshowed he was under the influence of alcohol several hours afterthe accident.   He had been sought since Sunday on a fugitive warrant for threemisdemeanor charges that carry a penalty of up to 2\ years in jail.Alaska authorities have said they will seek his extradition.   Exxon said it has changed its policy because of the spill andnow requires crews to be aboard ship, where drinking is prohibited,four hours before sailing.   Oil as thick as mayonnaise has soiled 800 miles of beach,thousands of animals are known dead, including at least 30 seaotters.   ``Dozens of otters are dying before rescuers can get to them,''said fish and game spokesman Jon Lyman.   The dead otters included a year-old pup, one of five that hadbeen sent to San Diego's Sea World for treatment.   While the toll from the nation's worst oil spill mounted, itsimpact on the flow of Alaskan crude was abating.   The Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. said it would resume a normaldaily flow of 2.1 million barrels of oil through the trans-Alaskapipeline today. The flow had been cut by 60 percent because ofrestrictions on tanker traffic in Valdez harbor, but thoserestrictions have eased.   In the longer turn, though, the spill could slow petroleumexploration in environmentally sensitive areas at leasttemporarily, Environmental Protection Administrator William Reillytold Congress.   On Tuesday, crews finished transferring about 42 million gallonsof crude from the crippled tanker to other ships in preparation forthe refloating. The $125 million vessel, one of Exxon's newest, hadbeen sitting on Bligh Reef in since running aground March 24 andspilling more than 10 million gallons of crude.   After that, Exxon said its first choice for dry dock isPortland, Ore., but officials there said they weren't sure ifthey'd allow that, even though the $12 million repair bill wouldprovide about 200 jobs.   ``A lot of questions that need to be answered,'' Oregon Gov.Neil Goldschmidt said.   Canadian authorities also asked Exxon for assurances that towingthe tanker to Oregon won't damage the British Columbia coast.   Exxon Shipping Co. President Frank Iarossi said the company hashad discussions with dry docks in South Korea, Japan and Singaporeabout accepting the vessel. He said the ship won't trail anypollution while it is towed.   Iarossi said Exxon had not added up its costs so far.``Millions, multiple millions. It's going to be big numbers,'' hesaid.   One hundred claims have been filed with the company for damages,including 40 on Tuesday alone. The claims have come mostly fromfishermen. Exxon has settled only two so far.   At least 14 lawsuits have been filed.   The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimatedthe leading edge of the spill was 100 miles southwest of the tankeroff the Kenai Peninsula. The spill has been pushed away from KenaiFjords National Park and the area south of Seward by water flowingout of Resurrection Bay.   Fisheries within the sound remained threatened, and the slickappeared to be oozing slowly toward other Alaskan ports.   Exxon gave $1 million on Monday to Prince William SoundAquaculture Corp. to buy boom to defend hatcheries, said SusanOgle, a spokeswoman for the Cordova spill response office.   Exxon said it has asked the State Department to notify Moscowthat it has accepted a Soviet offer of an oil skimmer. Five of theU.S. Navy's 18 heavy-duty oil skimmers went into operation Monday,and Exxon requested the remaining 13.   The company also said that placing an oil-catching boom aroundthe ship immediately after the grounding could have touched off agiant explosion of gases from the oil, although that was not thereason it took 11 hours to set the first containment line.   ``The worst thing we could have done early on was try to boomthe vessel. We would have lost the vessel,'' said Iarossi.   Officials have said boom wasn't placed around the vesselimmediately because the equipment wasn't available in Valdez.</TEXT></DOC>
