This license provides that, among other things,the facility is subject to all rules, regulations, and orders of the Commissionnow or hereafter in effect. The Sequoyah Unit 1 facility is a pressurized water reactor located atthe licensee's site in Hamilton County, Tennessee. <ITAG tagnum="84">II </ITAG>Sections III.D.2(a) and III.D.3 of Appendix J to 10 CFR Part 50, requireType B and C leakage tests on containment penetrations and isolation valves,respectively, at intervals in no case greater than two years. Sequoyah Unit 1 was shut down for refueling on August 22, 1985. Duringrefueling from late August 1985 to late November 1985 all Unit 1 Type Band C tests were performed. Since that time, Unit 1 has remained in coldshutdown (Mode 5). The end of the two year test interval for Type B andC tests expired in late August to November 1987. Because the Unit 1 outagehad extended past August 1987, the licensee in its letter dated August5, 1987, requested that the Type B and C tests be deferred on a one-timebasis until before Unit 1 enters Mode 4 in its return to power from thisoutage. The licensee contended that an exemption from the Type B and C test frequencyrequirements is warranted on the following bases: 1. NRC proposed amendments to 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J (reference pages9 and 10 of the October 1986 Draft Regulatory Document prepared under TaskMS 021-5) would supplement the two-year Type B and C test schedule withthe following sentence: ``If the two-year interval ends while primary containmentintegrity is not required, <T3>the test interval may be extended </T3>provided all deferred testingis successfully completed before containment integrity is required in theplant.'' 2. SQN Unit 1 Technical Specifications 3.6.1.1 and 3.6.1.2 require thatprimary containment integrity be maintained only when in Modes 1, 2, 3and 4. In these modes, Type B and C tests are required for maintainingcontainment integrity. 3. Relief from testing is warranted under 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(iii) becausecompliance with the two-year test requirement would ``result in undue hardshipand costs that are significantly in excess of those contemplated when theregulation was adopted.'' The licensee also considers 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(v)to be applicable because this exemption would ``provide only temporaryrelief from the applicable regulation.'' The staff has considered the Appendix J exemption request from the TypeB and C tests and has concluded that it is justified on a one-time basissince Unit 1 has been in Mode 5 (cold shutdown) for this period and containmentintegrity is not required when the reactor is in the cold shutdown condition.Furthermore, prior to entering Mode 4 (Heatup at Power), the licensee willconduct the Type B and C leakage tests in order to ensure containment integrity.Accordingly, the staff concludes that this Appendix J exemption is justified.<ITAG tagnum="84">III </ITAG>The Commission has evaluated the requested exemption and determined thatthe application of the regulations in these particular circumstances isnot necessary to achieve the underlying purpose of the rule in that thelicensee's proposed Type B and C testing schedule meets the underlyingintent of Appendix J which is to provide containment integrity during reactoroperating modes when the containment is required to mitigate the consequencesof a Design Basis Accident. Because the plant has remained in Mode 5 since August 1987 and primarycontainment integrity has not been required, conducting the Type B andC tests at that time was not necessary to achieve the underlying purposeof the rule which is to demonstrate that the containment has integrityfor operation (i.e., reactor Modes 1 to 4). Such integrity will be assuredthrough conducting the Type B and C tests prior to entry into Modes 1 to4. Therefore, application of the rule in these particular circumstancesis not necessary to achieve the underlying purpose of the rule and theproposed exemption meets 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(ii). <ITAG tagnum="84">IV </ITAG>Accordingly, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12,the exemption is authorized by law, will not present an undue risk to publichealth and safety, and is consistent with the common defense and security.The Commission further determines that special circumstances provided in10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(ii) justify granting the exemption. The Commission hereby grants a one-time exemption from the schedular requirementsof Appendix J to 10 CFR Part 50, Paragraphs III.D.2.(a) and III.D.3, tothe licensee for operation of the Sequoyah Nuclear Plant, Unit 1, basedon the condition that the required testing be conducted prior to entryinto Mode 4. Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that the issuanceof this exemption will not have a significant adverse impact on the qualityof the human environment (53 FR 23706, June 23, 1988).<ITAG tagnum="21">This exemption is effective upon issuance.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 14th day of July, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For The Nuclear Regulatory Commission. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James G.
