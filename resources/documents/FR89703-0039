The U.S. Fishand Wildlife Service (Service) proposes to protect and enhance approximately10,000 acres of coastal wetlands in Cameron Parish, Louisiana. The environmentalassessment evaluates the value and significance of the resources of thearea in regard to potential acquisition by the Service as an addition tothe National Wildlife Refuge System and to analyze other alternative usesof the area.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES:</T2> The assessment is presently available to the public asof July 3, 1989. Written comments must be received no later than August2, 1989, to be considered.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES:</T2> Comments and requests for copies of the assessmentshould be addressed to: Mr. Charles R. Danner, Chief, Project DevelopmentBranch, Office of Refuges and Wildlife, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,75 Spring Street, SW., Room 1240, Atlanta, GA 30303.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</T2> The primary objective for which thearea would be managed is the preservation of wintering habitat for migratorywaterfowl to help achieve the goals established by the North American WaterfowlManagement Plan. Marshes within the acquisition area are heavily used bywintering ducks such as gadwall, mottled duck, green-winged teal, blue-wingedteal, mallard, shoveler, widgeon, and pintail. Secondary uses compatiblewith the primary objective could include public recreational opportunitiessuch as hunting, fishing, and wildlife photography; environmental researchand related educational activities may also be compatible with the refugeobjectives. The project area has existing impoundments and water controlstructures that would allow rapid implementation of a wildlife managementplan for the new refuge. The proposed refuge is located in eastern Cameron Parish, approximately20 miles southwest of Lake Arthur, Louisiana. Lacassine National WildlifeRefuge lies approximately 12 miles to the northwest and Rockefeller WildlifeRefuge and Game Preserve (State) is five miles south. The area is accessibleonly by boat or small aircraft. Service biologists have prepared a draft environmental assessment (EA)in coordination with the State of Louisiana, other federal agencies andprivate groups which documents the impacts of the Service acquiring theland and establishing the refuge. Two other management alternatives andtheir subsequent impacts are also evaluated in the draft EA. The preferredalternative, <T3>i.e., </T3>Service acquisition and management, would be a positiveaction in preventing the loss or deterioration of valuable wetland resourcesof this Nation. <ITAG tagnum="34">June 13, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">W.T.
