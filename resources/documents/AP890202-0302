Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, the chairman of the panel, andRep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., a subcommittee chairman, alsocomplained about an ``institutionalized revolving door'' where majoraccounting firms assign employees to the Federal Home Loan BankBoard as ``fellows.'' The accountants on loan provide advice to thebank board before returning to their firms, the legislators said.   The statement by the two accompanied a long-awaited report fromthe General Accounting Office that turned up six instances in whichindependent accounting firms ``did not adequately audit''institutions that later failed.   The GAO, Congress' auditing and investigative agency, said it hadfound ``auditing and reporting problems ... significant enough (insix cases) to warrant our referring the CPA firms performing theaudits to regulatory and professional bodies for their review.''   It named five firms: J.K. Byrne andamp; Co., subsequently acquired byTouche Ross and Co.; Deloitte Haskins and Sells; Ernst and Whinney;Greenstein, Logan andamp; Co., and Arthur Young andamp; Co.   Aruthur Young audited two institutions that later became two ofthe biggest insolvencies in Texas, requiring billions of dollarsfrom the federal Sandamp;L insurance fund: Vernon Savings and LoanAssociation and Western Savings Association. Gonzalez and Annunziosaid Arthur Young received nearly $1 million in fees from the twoSandamp;Ls.   The two said they were ``appalled that the ... bank board ... didnot step in years earlier to demand reform of auditing proceduresand performance.'' They said they would conduct hearings on thematter.   M. Danny Wall, chairman of the bank board, said last week thathis agency is vigorously pursuing accounting firms that may havecontributed to failures.   Bank board spokesman William Fulwider said the agency has civilsuits against 11 firms, including three of the so-called ``BigEight,'' and ``other investigations are underway and could lead toadditional suits.''   Of the six institutions cited by the GAO, ``we have or had allunder investigation,'' he said. He said the bank board has had along-standing policy of pursuing accountants, lawyers and otherprofessionals that may have contributed to a failure, but said ittakes months and sometimes years to build a successful case.   Ernst andamp; Whinney released a statement saying, ``We find itincredible that our name has been mentioned in the context ofcontributing to Sandamp;L industry problems. ... The GAO did not assertany deficiencies in our audit procedures, but merely disagreed withhow our report disclosed one matter.''</TEXT></DOC>
