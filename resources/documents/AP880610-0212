ANDREWS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Defense lawyers asked the House on Friday todrop impeachment proceedings against imprisoned U.S. District JudgeWalter L. Nixon Jr., whom they portrayed as the innocent victim of``big prize fever'' gripping overzealous federal prosecutors.   ``He has committed no crime and has engaged in no impeachableoffense,'' attorney David Stewart told a House Judiciarysubcommittee before it concluded less than two days of impeachmenthearings against the Mississippi judge.   Nixon, 59, is serving a five-year prison sentence at Eglin AirForce Base in Florida for lying to a federal grand jury about hisdiscussions concerning drug charges against the son of a wealthyinvestor with whom Nixon had business dealings.   Nixon, a federal judge since 1968, continues to draw his $89,500annual salary while in prison. He refused to testify at theimpeachment proceeding Friday on the ground that he hadinsufficient time to prepare for questioning.   Former federal prosecutor Reid Weingarten testified that Nixonentered into a ``sweetheart deal'' with Mississippi investor WileyFairchild that led to the judge's perjury conviction in February1986.   Nixon bought oil and gas rights in three wells from Fairchildfor $9,500 in 1980 and subsequently made a reported $55,000 fromthe deal. Nixon testified at his trial that the transaction waslegitimate and that he promised no favors to Fairchild in return.   Nixon was acquitted of accepting an illegal gratuity fromFairchild, but was convicted on two counts of lying to a grand jurywhen he denied discussing drug smuggling charges against DrewFairchild with the elder Fairchild and with former state districtattorney Paul Holmes.   The oil well transaction ``was obviously a freebie ... asweetheart deal,'' Weingarten said. He quoted Nixon as tellingFairchild that ``if I can help you I will, and if I can't, I'lltell you.''   But Nixon insists that he never spoke to anyone about the drugcase, and says the questions posed when he testified before thegrand jury were ambiguous. Stewart, his attorney, charged Fridaythat Nixon ``has been unfairly convicted.''   Stewart told the House panel that in the early 1980s ``there wasa fever abroad in the public integrity section of the JusticeDepartment ... to convict a federal judge. You might even call itbig prize fever.''   He said federal prosecutors embarked on a corruptioninvestigation based on ``a lot of wild accusations'' by agovernment informant that were never corroborated.   ``For reasons we do not fully understand to this day, JudgeNixon did become the target of the public integrity section. Hebecame the big prize,'' Stewart said. ``... The biggest victim ofthis fever has been Walter Nixon.''   Stewart conceded that ``the circumstances are soewhat grim forJudge Nixon'' because of his perjury conviction and the SupremeCourt's denial of his final appeal.   Nixon's allegation that he was the innocent target of vindictiveprosecutors is the same defense that another imprisoned federaljudge, Harry E. Claiborne of Nevada, used without success duringhis Senate impeachment trial in October 1986.   Claiborne, who refused to resign even though he was convicted oftax evasion, was convicted of ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' bythe Senate and was removed from office after the first impeachmenttrial in half a century.   The only other federal judge to be indicted while in office isAlcee L. Hastings of Miami, who was acquitted in 1983 of briberyconspiracy.   A separate House Judiciary subcommittee completed three weeks ofhearings Thursday on subsequent charges that Hastings actuallycommitted the crime and tried to conceal his involvement by lyingunder oath and manufacturing evidence at his trial.   Nixon has been chief federal judge for the southern district ofMississippi, based in Biloxi, since 1982.</TEXT></DOC>
