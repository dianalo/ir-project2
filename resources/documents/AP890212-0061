Ms. Bhutto stopped short of ruling out an eventual confederationwith Afghanistan after Moscow withdraws the last of the Soviettroops, which have been backing the government of Afghan PresidentNajib in its war with Moslem guerrillas.   ``Let's see what the Afghan people decide for themselves,'' Ms.Bhutto told a news conference on the second day of a visit intendedmainly to emphasize Chinese-Pakistani ties.   Najib, who uses only one name, alleged Saturday that Pakistan wasmassing troops along their common border in preparation for aninvasion. He accused Afghan guerrillas of having agreed to link thecountry in a confederation with Pakistan in return for Pakistaniarms and money.   Ms. Bhutto denied Pakistan was moving troops to the border andsaid it would be naive for Pakistan to try to annex Afghanistan.   ``We've got enough problems of national integration,'' she said.``We don't need foreign adventures.''   ``People sometimes propose a confederation with one neighbor oranother,'' she added. ``Stray ideas like this ... may have come upin the past in relation to Afghanistan. I do not know because theyhave not gathered the weight to be considered by anybody.''   She said Najib made his accusations ``in a bid to divertattention from the real problems'' he faces.   In Pakistan, both the foreign and defense ministries calledNajib's allegations ``preposterous.''   Ms. Bhutto, on her first official trip abroad since her electionin November, met for 3{ hours Sunday morning with Premier Li Pengand had lunch with former Chinese President Li Xiannian.   She was scheduled to meet in Shanghai on Monday with seniorleader Deng Xiaoping. The 84-year-old Deng has been in Shanghai forseveral weeks, and there are rumors he is undergoing medicaltreatment.   Ms. Bhutto, who arrived in Beijing on Saturday, said the talkswith Li were useful and productive and ``enabled us to establish arapport.''   They covered bilateral ties, international affairs, the twocountries' economies, trade and communications, she said, adding,``We agreed on everything.''   Asked about a Pakistani newspaper report that Pakistan has agreedto buy 75 more fighter jets from China, Ms. Bhutto said only thatshe did not discuss planes with the Chinese. Pakistan long hasbought most of its planes and tanks from China.   Ms. Bhutto said officials of the two countries signed agreementsto encourage and protect mutual investment and extend a tradeprotocol to 1990.   Xinhua said she invited Li to visit Pakistan and he respondedthat he'd like to visit this year.   China and Pakistan have had close ties since 1950, when theyestablished diplomatic relations.</TEXT></DOC>
