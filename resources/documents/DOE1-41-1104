The pyrolysisapparatus had a 1 kg/h maximum coal throughput, reactor temperature was630 to 700 C. A comparison is made of brown coal properties and semicokeproperties after thermal treatment. Volatile content of brown coals studiedwas between 38 and 48%, that of semicoke 10 to 17%. Yield of coal liquidsby rapid pyrolysis was 5.1 to 14.3%, approximating values of Fischer(520 C) and Heinze (880 C) tests. The semicoke also showed reduced sulfurcontent, i.e. about 50% of the combustible coal sulfur content in coalfrom the Dudar, Varpalota and Borsod deposits, thus a significant desulfurizationeffect. Laboratory results indicate that rapid pyrolysis is a suitable,uncomplicated process for producing smoke-reduced semicoke with lowersulfur content from some brown coal types. Tables with pyrolysis resultsare provided.</TEXT></DOC>
