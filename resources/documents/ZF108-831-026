(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Garranties don't last forever, and neither will your company's computers orperipherals.andP;  Third-party service organizations can be a big help when yourwarranty runs out or doesn't cover the repairs you need, but shop around forthe one that will best meet your requirements.andM;Sooner or later your computer will teach you the painful lesson that it isnot immortal.andP;  No matter how powerful your system, eventually some type ofhardware failure will render it useless.andP;  Preparation for that failure canhelp your business avoid pain and aggravation, not to mention a perilous lossof productivity.andM;Over the years, PC Magazine has covered many products, including backupsoftware, file-recovery programs, tape drives, and uninterruptible powersupplies that help minimize your chances of trouble or save you once it hits.andO;This time, we'll look at how to get help from outside sources when you reallyneed it.andP;  The thriving industry of third-party service is eager to repairyour computers or peripheral devices; companies offering service range fromFortune 500 giants like Bell Atlantic, IBM, GE, and TRW to one- or-two-manshops that service only their local area.andM;EXTRA PROTECTIONandM;Whether you're an independent consultant working from your office at home, ora national corporation with thousands of PCs, it's important to consider sometype of computer protection that goes beyond the manufacturer's warranty.andO;Why? Warranties only cover specific things, and only for a limited period.andM;In order to be prepared for out-of-warranty service problems, most companiesbuy a service contract to cover equipment maintenance.andP;  Some very largecompanies obtain service contracts directly from product vendors as part oftheir sales agreement.andP;  Often, businesses use a combination of other servicesto maintain their computer systems: an in-house department or perhaps just aknowledgeable person on staff.andP;  In such cases, the third-party serviceprovider enters the picture to solve problems beyond the ability of the otherresources.andP;  For example, Ziff-Davis has an internal service department tohandle routine maintenance of the company's computers; however, because ofthe sophisticated nature of the equipment in PC Magazine Labs, and thetime-critical nature of the magazine business, PC Labs has a contract with athird-party organization to provide service not available from our internaldepartment.andM;The PC service and maintenance industry is a rapidly expanding business; whenit first began about five years ago, an IBM AT was state of the art, and mostPCs were used for standalone tasks, such as spreadsheet analysis and wordprocessing.andP;  Back then, the most important feature of a service organizationwas its ability to fix a broken machine.andP;  In today's computer market, wherePC servers are replacing minicomputers and large networks are connectingonce-isolated PCs together to form mission-critical systems, serviceorganizations are finding that they need to provide more than just a quickfix.andP;  Installation services, life-cycle maintenance, product training, andnationwide on-site service capabilities are becoming important issues formany companies.andM;Service vendors pick up at the point where a manufacturer often leavesoff-the servicing of warrantied and outof-warranty equipment.andP;  The largestservice companies, which are the focus of this article, have nationwide orinternational locations with technicians available to your site, or receiveequipment returned for repairs.andP;  They often provide extras like training,data or system conversions, installation help, and telephone or on-linesupport.andP;  The costs for these services vary not only from company to company,but within the service contracts offered by the individual service vendors.andO;Contracts can be specifically tailored to each customer or offered as astandard  &quot;boilerplate&quot; contract, depending upon how much you want to spend,and the service organization's level of flexibility.andP;  All of the companiesreviewed here stress that there are numerous variables that can make twocontracts for identical pieces of equipment have entirely different feestructures.andM;Surveying the top service companies and reporting on the types of servicesthey offer can't be accomplished by running benchmark tests.andP;  You can't timeservice, or put it in an isolated environment to test its features.andP;  Serviceis a relationship that exists between two companies and has many subtletiesthat cannot be covered in even the most comprehensive contracts.andP;  So use theinformation in this article to acquaint yourself with the available sources,but be careful when you select a service provider-make sure you feelconfident about the type of service you need and that the company can satisfyyour requirements before you sign any contracts.andP;  Remember that even the mostreputable nationwide chains have some shops that are overworked orunderequipped.andM;SOME SERVICE DEFINITIONSandM;When shopping for service, you need to be careful not to purchase overlappingservices-for example, you don't want to pay for a service contract onequipment that is already under some type of warranty.andP;  If you have a lot ofproducts that are still under warranty, you should try to negotiate a dealwith the third-party provider to specifically exclude warrantied productsfrom the contract.andP;  (It's worth noting that an important type of coverage isnot addressed in this article: fire insurance, theft, or other loss.andO;Insurance can be obtained either from your general insurer, or from aspecialist in computer insurance such as Safeware, The Insurance Agency Co.andO;in Columbus, Ohio ((800) 843-3469.))andM;In order to negotiate a good service contract, it's important to understandyour risks.andP;  When you do your research, you will encounter jargon related towarranties and service providers, and an understanding of some of theterminology is a prerequisite to a good contract.andP;  A computer warrantyusually provides the assurance that if the product fails because of a defect,the manufacturer will service it at no (or at a reduced) charge for aspecific period of time.andP;  You shouldn't confuse this with a guarantee, whichcovers the quality of a product or service; a guarantee typically offers youmoney back if it does not meet expectations of quality or performance.andP;  Aguarantee is fairly unusual in the computer business.andM;Warranties are effective for specific time periods-typically 30 days, 90days, one year, or longer.andP;  A computer manufacturer offers a warranty for theequipment it sells to assure customers that it stands behind its products.andO;Since some warranties are more comprehensive than others, a close reading ofthe warranty is important to understand exactly what is covered if theproduct requires service.andP;  (See the sidebar &quot;Reading the Fine Print: AnAnatomy of a Warranty.andP;  &quot;) Most warranties include some kind of service bythe warrantor within the warranty period.andP;  When the warranty expires theoriginal deal is effectively void, and it's up to you to cover repair costswhen problems arise.andP;  An extended warranty is a renewed agreement for aspecific period of time, offered by the manufacturer, vendor, or serviceprovider (who becomes the new warrantor).andP;  Unlike the initial warranty, whichis included in the cost of your product, there is usually a fee for theextended warranty.andM;A few manufacturers service their own equipment.andP;  Others, because of distanceand/or time and personnel constraints, make arrangements for outside partiesto handle their service problems.andP;  Northgate, for example, hires TRW toperform its warranty work.andM;After you have determined what is covered by the equipment warranty, and thecost and level of support for extended-warranty options (if they'reavailable), you are ready to look at some service contracts.andP;  Servicecompanies often divide the service they offer in their contracts into fourmain categories, with a typical service contract being a mixture of two,three or all four.andP;  The manufacturer, its physical location, and the itemsthat are internally and/or externally attached to it, are major factors takeninto account when the contract is drawn up and a fee table computed.andM;APPROACHES TO SERVICEandM;With on-site service, as its name implies, your equipment is serviced on yourpremises.andP;  You place a call and a technician responds within a given timeperiod-usually established in the contract (on the same business day, within24 hours, etc).andP;  Response time, however, is not repair time: it may takehours or even days to correctly diagnose and fix what ails your computer orperipheral.andP;  Actually, for companies with a very large installed base of PCs,many service companies will even arrange to have permanent on-site servicepersonnel who act as in-house troubleshooters and repair people.andM;Carry-in service is exactly the opposite of on-site service: instead ofbringing the service to the computer, you bring the computer to the service.andO;Carry-in is generally the least expensive way to repair your equipmentbecause the burden of transportation is placed on you.andP;  The number of centersa company operates (some have branches in every major city, others in only afew regions) can be an important factor.andP;  If your company is not in ametropolitan area, it may be quite a distance to the nearest service center.andO;To complicate matters, most are open only during business hours, forcingovernight or weekend waiting periods if your hard disk crashes at 7 P.M.andP;  onFriday.andP;  Some service companies offer free loaner or rental replacementequipment to make the repair interim more bearable, but be sure to ask forthis since it's often not offered.andM;Mail-in service steps in where carry-in leaves off-.andP;  if you are near aUnited Parcel, Federal Express or United States Postal Service office, youare that close to a central repair depot.andP;  Mail-in service is generally bestsuited for computer owners who are too far from a service center.andP;  Mail-inservice adds both time and cost to computer repair because shipping a CPU istime consuming and expensive.andP;  Most service companies will, if you have acontract with them, pay to ship the product back to you the same way that youshipped it in, known as mirror shipping.andP;  IBM's service agreement for the newPS/1 is similar to that type of mail-in arrangement; after diagnosing thedefective component by talking you through the analysis over the phone, IBMwill send you a replacement part before you send in your defective component.andO;You should also note the number of mail-in service centers a companyhas-while some delivery services will send a package across town or acrossthe U.S.andP;  at the same price, others charge variable rates according todistance.andM;Whatever service you opt for, you should investigate certain things.andP;  Forexample, does the company keep a client's service problems on record tomonitor recurring problems or reference work already done on particularmachines? Such a setup allows the service vendor to learn what problems yourequipment is prone to, and develop the best strategies for handling them.andP;  Isloaner or rental equipment available while your ailing system gets fixed?andO;What are the terms for cancelling (or  &quot;killing&quot;) a contract?andM;Time and materials service  or T-and-M service, as it is commonly called) isservice-on-site, carry-in or mail-in-that is not part of a contract.andP;  You arecharged for T-and-M service when there has never been a service contract,when a service contract has lapsed, or when damage occurs to a system forreasons not covered in the service contract.andP;  T-and-M fees can be very high,even for the smallest repair, making service contracts look very attractive.andO;Labor is usually the most expensive part of service.andP;  It is not uncommon topay $100 per hour for labor.andP;  If a system requires on-site service, manycompanies will charge a minimum fee to send the technician to the site, evenif the service center is just down the street.andP;  The cost can escalate if yourlocation is more than a certain number of miles from the servicer.andP;  Somecompanies don't charge for transportation and just bill by the hour-as soonas the technician leaves the center.andM;BETTER SHOP AROUNDandM;Before signing a service contract, it's a good idea to shop around and ask alot of very specific questions.andP;  When we asked the vendors to quote pricesfor hypothetical computer installations, we received ambiguous answers.andP;  Someof the service companies have left a number of areas open to negotiation, sotry and get some competitive bids.andP;  An important question to ask a potentialservice company is whether it is a manufacturer-authorized service companyfor your equipment.andP;  if the answer is yes, that means the manufacturer islikely to be providing up-to-date training, parts, and expertise to thetechnical staff; if not, you should inquire about parts availability andtechnical information.andP;  When you're asking about companies for which it isauthorized to provide warranty service, be sure to specify exactly what modelor type of product you have.andP;  Many service companies cover only certainproduct lines within each manufacturer's brandname.andM;We focused on nine of the largest nationwide service vendors, with amedium-sized regional service company added for comparison.andP;  If you'reinterested in a complete list of service companies, there is a two-volumereference work, titled &quot;NACD Profile Series-Service Companies,&quot; published bythe National Association of Computer Dealers.andP;  This reference book provides alist of more than 3,000 companies that provide service in the United States.andM;The companies we investigate and report on in this article are composed oftwo groups: the companies that sell both computers and service, and thecompanies who primarily offer service.andP;  In the first group are the &quot;bigthree&quot; computer sellers: IBM, ComputerLand, and BusinessLand.andP;  For the secondgroup, we targeted the largest of the nationwide service providers: BellAtlantic Business Systems Services; TRW, GECS, Intelogic Trace, Idea Servcom,and NCR.andP;  In addition we looked at Touch Tech, a mid-size company thatservices the northeastern region of the U.S., to compare how a typicalregional vendor stacks up to the big guys.andM;Other large companies not represented here include Dataserve,McDonnell-Douglas Field Service Co., and Decision Data Services.andP;  Dataservedid not supply any information about itself or answer the questionnaire, andMcDonnell-Douglas Field Service Co. was in the midst of a buyout offer andwas unable to respond.andP;  Decision Data Service provided a brochure detailingits merger with Momentum Technologies in 1988 and its 1989 acquisition of theFDR Field Service Co. of First Data Resources, but it would not respond toour specific questions.andM;We requested information about a variety of service-related topics from thesevendors, and summarize it in the features table.andP;  A portion of theinformation focuses on the hypothetical computer installations, which weasked the companies to return a bid on.andP;  These hypothetical installations(described in the sidebar &quot;Hypothetically Speaking: Some TypicalInstallations&quot;) were designed to give the service vendors a chance to morefully describe particular services that they provide to clients, ranging fromthe single user to a large, nationwide company.andP;  We emphasized to the vendorsthat the price quote aspect was only one part of the questionnaire, and thatproviding us with options and recommendations was probably the best way ofdistinguishing themselves.andP;  Because of the flexible and negotiable aspect ofservice contracts, there were some cases where a company's responses orpolicies did not exactly fit our direction.andP;  TRW, for example, indicated thatmany items were negotiable, whether they were &quot;standard&quot; or not.andP;  In suchcases we use the answer that we believe will be of most use to you, or give afuller, annotated explanation in the company profiles below.andM;HYPOTHETICAL SITUATIONSandM;Although the vendors' bids regarding the hypothetical installations aregenerally similar, some companies did respond uniquely.andP;  BusinessLand, forexample, proposed doing an in-depth analysis for the medium and largeinstallations to determine if users required training, and to see if thesystems needed upgrading.andP;  Some others declined to give us a quote at all.andM;Most of the organizations listed below began focusing on PCs in the past fiveyears.andP;  Originally, they were maintaining mainframes or minis.andP;  As PCs beganto integrate with these systems, the companies expanded into the PC area.andO;Some of the companies, like BusinessLand and ComputerLand, have been in themicrocomputer business from the start and service almost nothing but PCs.andM;Bell Atlantic Business Systems ServicesandM;Bell Atlantic Business Systems Services is the computer service division ofBen Atlantic.andP;  Formerly known as Sorbus, when Control Data Corp. was aquiredby and merged with it, the company was renamed.andP;  It maintains more IBM andDEC systems than any other organization and also services more than 500 otherbrands of hardware.andP;  Additionally, the company provides service from itsEuropean headquarters in Brussels.andM;In response to our questionnaire, Bell Atlantic indicated that it had anumber of on-site service variations.andP;  It listed On-Site, On-Site Deferred,Parts Plus, and On-Site Repair Center as standard options.andP;  Basic on-siteprovides a 4-hour response time, 11 hours per day, 5 days a week, witharound-the-clock coverage optional.andP;  If a customer owns extra PCs assubstitution for those that go down, the deferred on-site plan is quite costeffective; Bell Atlantic will come in and repair all defective computers atonce, rather than coming in each time one breaks down.andP;  The Repair Centeroption allows you to have a repair center established on-site.andM;Bell Atlantic Business Systems Services; 589 Phoenixville Pike, Malvern, PA19355; (215) 993-6700.andM;CIRCLE 6M ON READER SERVICE CARDandM;BusinessLandandM;BusinessLand is a franchised computer sales company with stores afl over thecountry.andP;  Because it is an authorized dealer of IBM, Compaq, and Applesystems, BusinessLand employees are trained to service these machines.andM;BusinessLand's response to our questionnaire provided a broad view of itsphilosophy concerning service relationships.andP;  It said it believes that thetrue cost of service and support over the life of the hardware will exceedthe hardware purchase price by two to d= times, and that costs can only bereduced by managing afl service and support areas,----including training, LANdevelopment and administration, and system obsolescence planning.andM;The single user will pay $904 in annual charges; there are extra laborcharges for on-site software support.andP;  We weren't given an exact contractprice for the small shop, but it provided a price range of between 4 and 12percent of the hardware list price based on the type of hardware, downtime,and response time requirements.andP;  Again, there are additional labor chargesfor all on-site software support.andM;We were not given exact prices for the medium and large installations,either.andP;  BusinessLand says it would first propose a consulting analysis (fora cost of anywhere from $10,000 to $40,000) of the total existing service andsupport costs for the customer.andP;  It would review end-user  training programs,phone support, hardware service, LAN maintenance and development.andP;  Afterthat, a hardware service contract would be drawn up, with volume discountsapplied for the number of systems at single-site locations.andP;  Service isperformed by BusinessLand for all sites within 25 miles of a BusinessLandcenter or branch office.andP;  Sites exceeding this distance are handled byBusinessLand service subcontractors; BusinessLand says that in these cases,it manages and is totally responsible for activity.andP;  In addition, completephone support with a direct tie-in to on-site dispatching is provided.andO;BusinessLand, 1001 Ridder Park Dr., San Jose, CA 95131; (408) 437-0400.andM;CIRCLE 671 ON READER SERVICE CARDandM;ComputerLandandM;Like BusinessLand, ComputerLand is a dealer.andP;  Companies like IBM, Compaq, andApple, require third parties to sell their computers in order to becomeauthorized and trained to service them.andM;We spoke to both ComputerLand Corporate and a ComputerLand franchisee.andP;  Fornationwide accounts, ComputerLand Corp. offers support through its UnityProgram, which coordinates franchisees to provide service for the corporateaccounts.andP;  For local and regional accounts, service is usually provided by afranchisee.andM;It should be noted that the answers we received from ComputerLand Corp. andthe franchisee were slightly different.andP;  For example, the quotes for time andmaterials costs were considerably higher from ComputerLand Corp. than theprices quoted by the franchisee.andP;  If you have an account with a parentcorporation like ComputerLand Corp., but will be using the services of afranchisee, try to become familiar with the latter's personnel andorganization.andM;Neither ComputerLand Corp. nor the franchisee would give us price quotes onthe hypothetical installations.andP;
