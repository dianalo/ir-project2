The report, prepared by the congressional Office ofTechnology Assessment, says the department's goal of cleaningup all the weapons sites throughout the nation in 30 years isunfounded, because it isn't based on meaningful estimates ofthe work to be done, the level of cleanup to be accomplishedand the availability of necessary technologies. Many sitesmay never be suitable for unrestricted public access, thestudy predicts.</LP><TEXT>   Moreover, the Energy Department's assertion thatcontamination at the weapons plants doesn't pose an imminenthealth risk &quot;may be correct but is not substantiated byscientific evidence,&quot; according to the report, which statesthat there is &quot;substantial public distrust of DOE's methodsand motivations.&quot;   The report underscores the severity of the problem. Forexample, it contends that ground water at every site iscontaminated with radionuclides or hazardous chemicals.   Energy Secretary James Watkins said the report &quot;addsindependent confirmation of the fact that this is a problemof enormous proportions and will require yet unavailabletechnology and trained personnel to resolve it.&quot; The studysays cleanup efforts are being hampered by a lack oftechnical solutions, reliable data and qualified personnel.   Among policy options for Congress to consider, the studysuggests increased congressional oversight of the EnergyDepartment and other federal agencies involved with thecleanup and greater outside regulation of the department'sradioactive-waste management activities.</TEXT></DOC>
