Even to the end of his presidency, Reagan said, officials werecontinuing to explore ``quietly and privately'' how to win freedomfor the nine Americans. ``There hasn't been a moment that this isn'ton our minds,'' he said.   ``We know that any overt attempt at rescue, even if we did have ahint or a clue (about their whereabouts), could run the risk oftheir assassination or execution before we could get them out,'' hetold reporters for The Associated Press and other news services.   Reagan also said in the wide-ranging interview that:   _He contines to believe U.S. arms sales to Iranian elements in1985 and 1986 did not constitute an attempt to trade arms for thehostages, held by pro-Iranian Lebanese kidnappers. Viewing the saleas an attempted swap amounted, he said, to ``a total mediadistortion.''   _He stil feels former White House aides Oliver L. North and JohnM. Poindexter will be found innocent of criminal wrongdoing inconnection with the arms deal. He seemed to rule out grantingpardons for either man before leaving office at noon Friday, sayingthat to do so would ``leave them forever after with that guilthanging over them.''   _He has high confidence in George Bush's ability to handleU.S.-Soviet relations.   As to the hostages, Reagan said their situation did not parallelthat of the 52 Americans freed from captivity the day he tookoffice, Jan. 20, 1981, after 444 days as prisoners in Iran.   During the 1980 campaign against Jimmy Carter, Reagan criticizedthe president for being unable to win their release.   Reagan had criticized Carter's handling of the hostage-taking atthe U.S. Embassy in Tehran as ``too sluggish'' and had said on Jan.7, 1980:   ``I believe it's appropriate to suggest that anything that hasbeen done by the administration so far, could have, should have,been done in the first hour.''   In Thursday's interview, Reagan declined to take back thecriticism.   ``We were facing two very different situations,'' he said, notingthat in the earlier situation, more than 50 people had been takenprisoner in the embassy and had been kidnapped by the government ofIran.   On the other hand, he said, the Americans held in Lebanon werekidnapped individually by terrorists.   Nine Americans are prisoners. Associated Press chief Middle Eastcorrespondent Terry Anderson has held the longest, since March 16,1985.   On the question of U.S. dealings with Soviet President Mikhail S.Gorbachev, Reagan said he thought Bush would move forward on theissue of reducing the superpower stockpiles of long-range nuclearweapons, but that caution should be used.   ``I think we have to realize that in these negotiations ...they're not just based on what someone says. They're based on deeds.And I think that George (Bush) will be very prepared there, based onwhat the deeds are.''   Reagan said he does not believe he is less popular in Europe thanSoviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, as some polls have said.   ``I can't quite accept that he's more popular than I am,'' Reagansaid.</TEXT></DOC>
