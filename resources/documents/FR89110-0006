Based upon these considerations, the Commission,as set forth in Commission Rule 30.10, determined to permit persons<T3> located outside the United States</T3> and subject to a comparableregulatory structure in the jurisdiction in which they are located to seekan exemption from certain of the requirements imposed by the Part 30 rulesbased upon substituted compliance with the comparable regulatory requirementsimposed by the foreign jurisdiction.Appendix A to Part 30, ``Interpretative Statement With Respect to the Commission'sExemptive Authority Under Section 30.10 of Its Rules'' (``Appendix A''),generally sets forth the elements the Commission will evaluate in determiningwhether a particular regulatory program may be found to be comparable forpurposes of exemptive relief pursuant to Commission Rule 30.10. 52 FR 28980,29001. These elements include: (1) Registration, authorization or otherform of licensing, fitness review or qualification of persons through whomcustomer orders are solicited and accepted; (2) minimum financial requirementsfor those persons who accept customer funds; (3) protection of customerfunds from misapplication; (4) recordkeeping and reporting requirements;(5) sales practice standards; (6) procedures to audit for compliance with,and to take action against those persons who violate, the requirementsof the program; and (7) information sharing arrangements between the Commissionand the appropriate governmental and/or self-regulatory organization toensure Commission access on an ``as needed'' basis to information essentialto maintaining adequate standards of customer and market protection withinthe United States.Moreover, in adopting Commission Rule 30.10, the Commission stated thatno exemption of a general nature would be granted unless the persons towhom the exemption is to be applied: (1) Consensually submit to jurisdictionin the United States by designating an agent for service of process inthe United States with respect to activity subject to Part 30 and filinga copy of the agency agreement with the National Futures Association (``NFA'');(2) agree to make their books and records available in the United Statesto Commission and Department of Justice representatives; and (3) notifythe NFA of the commencement or termination of business in the United States.\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ 52 FR 28980, 28981 and 29002.By letter dated January 29, 1988, SIMEX, which is regulated by the MonetaryAuthority of Singapore (``MAS''), petitioned the Commission for an exemptionfrom the application of certain of the Commission's foreign futures andoption rules. In support of its petition, SIMEX represented that grantingsuch an exemption with respect to its members would not be contrary tothe public interest or to the purposes of the provisions from which theexemption is sought because SIMEX and its members were subject to a regulatoryscheme comparable to that imposed by the Commodity Exchange Act (``Act'')and the regulations thereunder.Based upon a review of the petition, supporting materials filed by SIMEXand the recommendation of the staff, the Commission has concluded thatthe standards for relief set forth in Commission Rule 30.10 and, in particular,Appendix A thereof, have generally been satisfied and that compliance withapplicable Singapore law, regulations and SIMEX rules may be substitutedfor compliance with those sections of the Act more particularly set forthherein.By this Order, the Commission hereby exempts, subject to specified conditions,those firms identified to the Commission as eligible for the relief grantedherein from:<ITAG tagnum="15">_Registration with the Commission;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_The separate account requirement contained in Commission Rule 30.717 CFR 30.7; and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Those sections of Part I of the Commission's financial regulationsthat apply to foreign futures and options sold in the United States asset forth in Part 30;</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">based upon substituted compliance by such persons with the applicablestatutes, regulations and relevant exchange rules of the SIMEX in effectin Singapore.This determination to permit substituted compliance is based on, amongother things, the Commission's finding that the regulatory scheme governingthe persons in Singapore who would be exempted hereunder provides:(1) A system of licensing of firms and persons who deal in transactionssubject to regulation under Part 30 that includes, for example, proceduresfor granting, conditioning, monitoring, suspending and revoking licenses,and provisions for requiring and obtaining access to information aboutlicensees;(2) Financial requirements for firms carrying customer accounts including,without limitation, a required minimum level of adjusted net capital ofS$250,000 (US$129,075) \2\<NOTE/> or 10% of the amount of customer funds required to be segregated,whichever is higher, and an early warning system requiring firms to immediatelyinform MAS or SIMEX, as appropriate, if such firms' adjusted net capitalfalls below a specified level;<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Currency is valued at .5163 United States dollar equivalentas of December 12, 1988. <T3>The Wall Street Journal, </T3>December 13, 1988, at C13, col. 4.(3) A system for the protection of customer funds that applies to all customerswhich provides for the maintenance of customer trust accounts at designatedlocations and in designated investments, which precludes the use of customerfunds to satisfy house obligations and which mandates certified auditsof accounts, augmented by a compensation fund administered by SIMEX;(4) Recordkeeping and reporting requirements pertaining to financial andtrade information including, without limitation, records of all customertransactions, monthly customer account statements, customer segregationrecords and discretionary account documentation;(5) Sales practice standards for licensees which include, for example,required risk disclosures to prospective customers and prohibitions on:(a) Fraudulent and misleading practices; (b) commingling of customer fundswith house funds; and (c) insider dealing and other improper trading practices;(6) Procedures to aduit for compliance with, and to redress violationsof, customer protection and sales practice requirements including, withoutlimitation, an affirmative surveillance program which monitors and enforcescompliance with rules adopted with respect to fraud, bucketing, manipulation,the withholding of orders, trading ahead of or opposite customer orders,and prearranged trades, among others; and(7) Mechanisms for sharing imformation with the Commission and NFA of an``as needed'' basis including, without limitation, confirmation data, datanecessary to trace funds related to trading futures and option productssubject to regulation in Singapore, position data and data on firms' standingto do business and financial condition.This Order does not provide an exemption from any provision of the Actor regulations thereunder not specified herein, for example, without limitation,the anti-fraud provision in Commission Rule 30.9, 17 CFR 30.9, or the disclosureprovisions of Commission Rules 30.6 and 33.7, 17 CFR 30.6 and 33.7. Moreover,the relief granted is directed to brokerage activities by the firm licensedin Singapore on SIMEX and does not extend to rules or regulations relatingto trading, directly or indirectly, on United States exchanges. For example,such a firm trading on United States markets for its own account wouldbe subject to the large trader reporting requirement. <T3>See, e.g., </T3>17 CFR Part 18. Similarly, if such a firm were carryinga position on a United States exchange on behalf of foreign clients, itwould be subject to, among other things, the reporting requirements applicableto foreign brokers. <T3>See e.g., </T3>17 CFR Parts 17 and 21. The relief herein is inapplicablewhere the firm solicits United States customers for transactions on UnitedStates markets. In that case, the firm must comply with all applicableUnited States laws and regulations, including the requirements to registerin the appropriate capacity.The eligibility of any firm to seek relief under this exemptive Order issubject to the following conditions:(1) The regulatory or self-regulatory organization responsible for monitoringthe compliance of such firm with the regulatory requirements describedin the Rule 30.10 petition must represent in writing to the CFTC that:(a) Each firm for which relief is sought is registered, licensed or authorized,as appropriate, and is otherwise in good standing under the standards inplace in Singapore; such firm is engaged in business with customers locatedin Singapore as well as in the United States; and such firm would not bestatutorily disqualified from registration under section 8a(2) of the Act,7 U.S.C. 12(a)(2);(b) It will monitor firms to which relief is granted for compliance withthe regulatory requirements for which substituted compliance is acceptedand will promptly notify the Commission or NFA of any change in statusof a firm which would affect its continued eligibility for the exemptiongranted hereunder, including the termination of its activities in the UnitedStates;(c) All transactions on SIMEX with respect to customers resident in theUnited States will be made on or subject to the rules of SIMEX and theCommission will receive prompt notice of all material changes in the SingaporeFutures Trading Act of 1986, Regulations thereunder and SIMEX rules;(d) Customers resident in the United States will be provided no less stringentregulatory protection than Singapore customers under all relevant provisionsof Singapore law; and(e) It will cooperate with the Commission with respect to any inquiriesconcerning any activity subject to regulation under the Part 30 rules,including sharing the information specified in Appendix A to the Part 30rules on an `` as needed'' basis and will use its best efforts to notifythe Commission if it becomes aware of any information which in its judgmentaffects the financial or operational viability of a Singapore-domiciledfirm doing business in the United States under the exemption granted bythis order.\3\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\In this connection, the Commission notes that SIMEX's petitiondated January 29, 1988 and related documents already address the representationsrequired in paragraphs (1) (c), (d) and (e) of the conditions specifiedabove.(2) Each firm seeking relief hereunder must apply in writing whereby it:(a) Consents to jurisdiction in the United States under the Act and filesa valid and binding appointment of an agent in the United States for serviceof process in accordance with the requirements set forth in CommissionRule 30.5, 17 CFR 30.5;(b) Agrees to provide the books and records related to transactions underPart 30 required to be maintained under the applicable statutes, regulationsand SIMEX rules in effect in Singapore upon the request of any representativeof the Commission or United States Department of Justice at the place inthe United States designated by such representative, within 72 hours, orsuch lesser period of time as specified by that representative, after noticeof the request;(c) Represents that no principal of such firm would be disqualified fromdirectly applying to do business in the United States under Section 8a(2)of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 12a(2), and notifies the Commission promptly of anychange in that representation based on a change in control as generallydefined in Commission Rule 3.32, 17 CFR 3.32;(d) Discloses the identity of each subsidiary or affiliate domiciled inthe United States with a related business (<T3>e.g.,</T3> bank or broker/dealer affiliate) and provides brief descriptionof such subsidiary's or affiliate's principal business in the United States;(e) Consents to participate in any NFA arbitration program which offersa procedure for resolving customer disputes on the papers where such disputesinvolve representatives or activities with respect to foreign futures andoption transactions under Part 30 and consents to notify all customersresident in the United States of the availability of such a program; and(f) Undertakes to comply with the applicable provisions of Singapore lawand SIMEX rules which form the basis upon which this exemption from certainprovisions of the Act is granted.This order will become effective as to any firm designated under the Commission'sinterim order or hereinafter designated the later of thirty days afterpublication of the Order in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> or after filing of the consents hereinabove required.Upon filing of the notice required under paragraph (1)(b) as to any firm,the relief granted by this Order may be suspended immediately as to thatfirm. That suspension will remain in effect pending further notice by theCommission, or the Commission's designee, to the firm and SIMEX and/orany applicable regulatory or self-regulatory organization.This Order is issued pursuant to Commission Rule 30.10 based on the comparabilityrepresentations made and supporting material provided to the Commissionand the recommendation of the staff, and is made effective as to any firmgranted relief hereunder based upon the filings and representations ofsuch firm required hereunder. Any material changes or omissions in thefacts and circumstances pursuant to which this Order is granted might requirethe Commission to reconsider its finding that the standards for reliefset forth in Commission Rule 30.10 and, in particular, Appendix A thereof,generally have been satisfied. Further, if experience demonstrates thatthe continued effectiveness of this Order in general, or with respect toa particular firm, would be contrary to public policy or the public interest,or that the systems in place for the exchange of information or other circumstancesdo not warrant continuation of the exemptive relief granted herein, theCommission may condition, modify, suspend, terminate, withhold as to aspecific firm, or otherwise restrict the exemptive relief granted in thisOrder, as appropriate, on its own motion. For example, the relief grantedto a specific firm may be suspended upon the firm's failure to providerelevant books and records. If necessary, provisions will be made for servicingexisting client positions.In the future, the Commission may determine that other considerations andconditions are also relevant to the determination to exempt, or to continueto exempt, specified firms from the application of the Part 30 rules generally.To this end, the Commission will continue to monitor the implementationof its program to exempt firms located in jurisdictions generally deemedto have a comparable regulatory program from the application of certainof the foreign futures and option rules.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 17 CFR Part 30</ITAG>Commodity futures.Accordingly, 17 CFR Part 30 is amended as set forth below:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 30_FOREIGN FUTURES AND FOREIGN OPTION TRANSACTIONS</ITAG>1.
