By a 96-0 vote, lawmakers extended the prohibition that is to end Aug. 10. If the House agrees, the extension would have the effect of putting off any move to resolve the multibillion-dollar crisis in the thrift industry until the next Congress and a new presidency.    Many FSLIC-insured thrifts would like to switch insurers because FSLIC's premiums are 2 1/2 times higher than those charged by the FDIC, which mainly insures banks. But fewer than one in three institutions has the 6% capital-to-assets ratio required for admission to the FDIC system, so most want to prohibit their strongest brethren from leaving FSLIC.    Federal thrift regulators fear that departures could impair FSLIC's ability to raise money in the capital markets, where it sells bonds, and would reduce FSLIC's premium income when it most desperately needs the money. The General Accounting Office recently concluded that the insurance fund is insolvent and will need $26 billion to $36 billion to restore its sick member thrifts to health.    The extension of the ban was attached by a voice vote to House-passed legislation directing the U.S. Mint to strike coins commemorating the bicentennial of Congress. The Senate vote sent the measure back to the House, which must decide whether to accept the Senate changes. </TEXT></DOC>
