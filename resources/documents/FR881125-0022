Roberts, Freedom ofInformation Officer, (202) 472-7453.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>The Department of Health and HumanServices (HHS) published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to revise itsFOIA regulations on April 18, 1986 (51 FR 13250). Pursuant to that notice,HHS received comments and considered them. After that publication, Congressenacted the Freedom of Information Reform Act of 1986, Pub. L. 99-570,1801 through 1804. This statute amended the FOIA provisions on law enforcementrecords and on search fees and fee waivers. Also after that publication,the President promulgated Executive Order 12600 requiring agencies to establishprocedures for predisclosure notification of business records.  HHS published a rule based on the proposed rule, the comments, the FOIReform Act, and the Executive Order on November 13, 1987 (52 FR 43575).The rule was an interim final rule with respect to certain portions ofandSection; 5.5 (specifically, the definitions of ``commercial use,'' ``duplication,''``educational institution,'' ``non-commercial scientific institution,''``representative of the news media,'' ``review,'' and ``search'' only)and with respect to andSection;andSection; 5.41 through 5.45 and andSection;5.65 (c) through (e). As to all other portions, the rule was a final rule.HHS solicited comments on the interim final portions, and we received commentsfrom one individual and from two public interest groups. We have carefullyconsidered those comments, and our responses to them are presented below.We are also making some minor technical changes at this time, and thoseare explained at the end of the preamble.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Comments and of Changes  </ITAG>Definitions (andSection; 5.5)  The Freedom of Information Reform Act substantially revised the law onfees. Its primary effect was to establish three categories of requestsand to prescribe which types of fees could be charged for each. For commercialuse requests, agencies may charge for search, duplication, and review;for non-commercial requests from educational and scientific institutionsand from news media representatives, agencies may charge for duplicationonly; and for other requests, agencies may charge search and duplicationonly. The statute also grants two free hours of search time and 100 freepages of duplication for the latter two categories, and it bars chargingfees where the costs of collecting the fee exceed the fee to be collected.The statute also revised the standard for fee waivers. The portions ofthe rule that defined some of the terms introduced by this statute hadan interim final status.  ``Commercial use.'' One comment suggested that all non-profit entitiesbe categorically excluded from this definition, partly because the criterionshould be the nature of the entity rather than the nature of the use. However,the statutory language focuses on the nature of the use, and a not-for-profitentity can have commercial uses. The existing language in the rule focusesthe inquiry on the nature of the use while stating that we will take intoaccount the nature (including the nonprofit nature) of the requester. Italso states that when a request is from a representative of the news media,a use supporting the news dissemination function is not a commercial use.We are leaving this language unchanged.  ``Educational institution.'' One comment suggested that the definitionis too narrow, and recommended either leaving the term undefined or usingthe definition in the tax code, I.R.C. section 501(c)(3). We have decidedinstead to modify the definition to conform with the Guidelines promulgatedby the Office of Management and Budget at 52 FR 10012, 10018 (1987).  ``Representative of the news media.'' All three commenters addressed thisdefinition. One comment suggested striking the entire paragraph. All objectedexplicitly or implicitly to the definition of ``news'' in the second sentence,expressing concerns that a government agency should not be making determinationsof newsworthiness. Two comments suggested that the important factor shouldbe who the representative is, and not what is being requested. Two commentersexpressed concern that the definition excluded requests relating to historicalevents.  We believe that the major concerns of the commenters can be satisfied withoutstriking the entire paragraph. We recognize that the information soughtneed not be itself ``news'' or directly about very current events in orderto qualify for an exemption from paying search fees. Thus, a journalist'srequest for information about historical events would qualify if, for example,those historical events were background to current events or were otherwiseof current interest.  We also recognize that it would be improper to let our determination ofwhether a particular request should be treated for fee purposes as havingbeen made by a ``representative of the news media'' be influenced by anypartisan political interest or by any parochial institutional interestin limiting what the public ought to know, and we do not intend to havethose determinations influenced by any such interests.  We have decided to strike the sentence defining ``news'' and to revisethe first sentence as follows: `` `Representative of the news media' meansa person actively gathering information for an entity organized and operatedto publish or broadcast news to the public.''  Two of the comments were specifically concerned with the treatment of freelancejournalists in the definition. One commenter said the definition requiresa freelancer to be associated with a specific news organization, and thatsuch a requirement is improper. We are not amending the language basedon this comment, since the definition does not impose any such requirement.The other commenter argued that requiring a freelancer to show ``a solidbasis'' for expecting publication was too restrictive a standard. We havesubstituted ``likelihood of publication'' for ``solid basis for expectingpublication.''``Review.'' One commenter suggested striking this definition since it wouldreward inefficiency and would encourage delays in disclosure while theagency ran up review costs. We are leaving the language unchanged. Theact explicitly authorizes charging for review costs, although only in thecase of commercial use requests. Neither the act nor the regulation suggeststhat this provision expands any deadlines, and the act allows us to chargeonly ``reasonable'' fees.Fees (Subpart D)One comment suggested that andSection; 5.41 (b) and (c) refer to the availabilityof fee waivers. We are leaving these subsections unchanged, since thisavailability is already mentioned in the introductory language in andSection;5.41.One comment objected to the statement in andSection; 5.42(a) that we maycharge search fees even if the records found are exempt or if we do notfind any records. We are leaving this language unchanged. This is consistentwith the position taken by the Office of Management and Budget in its uniformFOIA fee schedule and guidelines, at paragraph 9(b). See 52 FR 10012, 10019.A request of this sort has still caused us to incur costs of search and/orreview. Also, in some cases, the non-existence of records within the scopeof a request may itself be an informative result.One comment, without referring specifically to HHS or to our interim finalrule, objected generally to agencies' construing two hours of search timefor computer searches differently from the way they construe it for manualsearches. In andSection; 5.42(b), we apply the two-hour waiver identicallyin connection with computer searches and in human searches_in both cases,what is waived is the first two hours of human work. The operation of thecomputer is a cost of operating a machine, which is distinct from the costsof an employee's time. We make this distinction consistently in andSection;andSection;5.42(b); 5.43 (b), (d).In andSection; 5.43(a), we are updating the information about rates currentlycharged.We have revised andSection; 5.44 to provide that we will normally requirepayment of all fees before furnishing records, with exceptions such asrequesters with histories of prompt payment. We expect this will improvecollection of fees owed. In that section, we are no longer specifying thatfees be paid by check or money order; the instructions described in andSection;5.44(c) will specify modes of payment.Two comments suggested eliminating andSection; 5.45 (b) through (c), whichexplain the statutory standard for fee waivers. They said these provisionsviolate the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq. </T3>One said the factors set forth here do not adequatelytake into account the public's interest in monitoring agency activities,and that they ought to, but fail to, make possible a waiver where the requesterconcludes after reading the records that the agency has acted properlyand that no news story is warranted. We are retaining these provisions.They do not violate the Paperwork Reduction Act_they merely explicate thestatutory standard and do not impose any reporting requirement on waiverapplicants. The public's interest in monitoring agency activities is takeninto account in paragraph (b). Finally, the provisions do not require thata story actually be written. For example, ``whether the requester's intendeduse of the information would be likely to disseminate the information amongthe public'' (paragraph (b)(3)) turns on whether public dissemination wouldbe likely if anything newsworthy were found, and not on the likelihoodof finding anything newsworthy.One comment suggested that andSection; 5.45 provide for waivers automaticallywhen the requested information concerned violations of law, governmentinefficiency or misconduct, or agency administrative error. We are notadding such a provision. These circumstances may be relevant in applyingthe statutory standard, but they cannot expand on that standard.One comment suggested establishing a presumption that public interest organizations,scholars, and journalists are entitled to fee waivers. We believe thatany such formal presumption is neither necessary nor appropriate. The preambleto the November 13, 1987, publication (52 FR at 43577-43578) has alreadyexplained why we decided not to include an automatic waiver for news mediarepresentatives_such an automatic waiver would render superfluous the explicitstatutory inclusion of those persons in the category of requesters that,while exempt from search and review costs, does normally have to pay duplicatingcosts. The explicit provisions regarding the news media in the final rule(andSection; 5.45 (b)(3), (c)(1)) should help make clear that news mediarepresentatives will be granted waivers when appropriate.One comment objected to focusing on the informational value of only thedisclosable portions of the records. The comment did not address any specificpart of this regulation, but this limitation is inherent in andSection; 5.45(b),especially in paragraph (b)(1). We are leaving that language unchanged.The statutory criterion requires such consideration, since informationthat is not disclosed cannot contribute to public understanding.One comment suggested a substitute streamlined test that would requirea waiver when all the following tests are met: The information is not soughtfor a primarily commercial purpose or for a primarily personal purpose;it is sought in connection with an issue of good government or generalpublic concern; it is sought in order to further some civic, political,or public communication or other activity; and it is not generally andeasily available to the public. We are retaining the analysis set forthin paragraphs (b) and (c), since that is a more accurate interpretationof the statutory language.One comment objected to certain language in guidance issued by the Departmentof Justice on April 2, 1987. The language in question advised allowingfee waivers only if the information disclosed would contribute to the understandingof ``the public at large, as opposed to the individual understanding ofthe requester or a narrow segment of interested persons.'' The quoted languageis similar to andSection; 5.45(b)(3), so we have reviewed that subsectionin light of the comment. The comment argues that dissemination of the informationamong the most concerned or affected subset of the public should suffice,and that dissemination to the public at large is not required. We agreethat it is not necessary that the entire population learn of the information.On the other hand, the disclosure does not serve the ``public interest''by ``contribut[ing] significantly to public understanding'' where onlya few individuals learn of the information. We are concerned that the currentlanguage of paragraph (b)(3), distinguishing the general public from a``segment'' of interested persons, might be read as requiring a more universaldissemination than should be required. Thus, we are changing ``segment''to ``narrow segment.'' Our intent is that waivers not be limited to situationswhere the entire public will learn of the information, but rather to excludesituations where only a relatively small group will learn of it.The same commenter objects to language in the Justice Department guidancethat interprets the statutory phrase ``contribute significantly to publicunderstanding'' as requiring agencies to determine whether the level ofpublic understanding after the disclosure is substantially greater thanthe predisclosure level. The comment suggests that information contributes``significantly'' to public understanding whenever the information hasmeaning. We have reviewed andSection; 5.45(b)(4) in light of this comment,and have decided to leave it unchanged. This subsection correctly treats``significantly'' as meaning ``to a significant degree,'' and thus as synonymouswith ``substantially.''One comment objected to the requirement, in andSection; 5.45(e), that a waiverrequest be made at the same time as the request for records. We are retainingthis requirement. We need to make the determination as to waiver at theoutset so that, if we deny the waiver request, the requester can decidewhether to assume liability for the fees before we underake the burdenof searching and copying.In andSection; 5.45(d), we have eliminated language that would make narrownessof passing one of the tests a basis for merely reducing fees rather thanwaiving them.In andSection; 5.45(e), we have added a sentence incorporating by referencethe appeal process set out in andSection; 5.34(c).Predisclosure Notification Procedures (andSection; 5.65 (c) through (e))One comment objects to the predisclosure notification procedures on thegrounds that they would hinder compliance with the time limits imposedby the FOIA, and it recommends that the regulations state that the procedurescan be followed only to the extent permitted by law. We are leaving thelanguage unchanged. Our authority, and our duty, to protect trade secretsand confidential and privileged commercial and financial information isbased on statutes. <T3>See</T3> 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4); 18 U.S.C. 1905. Executive Order 12600and this regulation establish a reasonable way to comply to the greatestpossible degree with both the FOIA time requirements and the requirementto protect this information. The regulation recites the FOIA time limitsandSection; 5.35, and no restatement in necessary in this section.Another commenter concerned about the effect of these procedures on timelyprocessing of requests recommends that the regulation (a) state that wewill not delay processing the request while sending predisclosure notificationand awaiting the submitter's response, (b) state time limits for the submitterto respond, (c) state that we will inform the requester of the dates whenwe sent notice to the submitter and received its response and of the methodof notification, and (d) state that we will notify the requester when wereject a submitter's objections and will tell the requester the date whenwe will release the records absent a court order. We are leaving the languageunchanged. Recommendation (a) is treated in the paragraph immediately above.Recommendation (b) in unnecessary, since the time limit for the submitteris already fixed at five days, in andSection; 5.65(d)(2). We believe thatthe other two recommendations would create unnecessary paperwork.We are revising andSection; 5.65(c) to say that where a request for proposalsor request for quotations mandates certain language in order to designaterecords as confidential, then that language is necessary. This change willmake this regulation consistent with the HHS Acquisition Regulations, 48CFR 252.215-12.Minor Technical CorrectionsWe have made several minor technical corrections.We have added 18 U.S.C. 1905 to the citation of authority for the regulation.In andSection; 5.5, we are clarifying the definitions of ``agency'' and ``Department''to refer to ``<T3>Medicare</T3> health insurance.'' We are also modifying the definitionof ``request'' to conform with our regulation governing responses to subpoenas,45 CFR Part 2. In andSection; 5.21(a), we are making it optional for FOI Officers to writedown oral requests.In andSection; 5.22(a), we are adding a reference to requests for detailedearning statements under the Social Security program. In andSection; 5.24(b),we are changing ``on take'' to ``in an electronic medium.'' In andSection; 5.31(a)(1)(ii), the office mentioned is the Family Support(not ``Services'') Administration. In andSection; 5.31(a)(2)(i), we haveadded a reference to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry.We have added a provision for an FOI Officer for the Indian Health Servicein andSection; 5.31(a)(2)(vi), and andSection; 5.31(c). In andSection; 5.31(a)(3),the SSA FOI Officer is the Director, Office of Public Inquiries (not Officeof Information). In various paragraphs of andSection; 5.31(a), we have eliminatedas superfluous the phrase ``or his or her designee;'' delegation is adequatelyprovided for in paragraph (b). We have updated the addresses and/or phonenumbers for the FOI Officers for HHS, SSA, HCFA, PHS, and NIH.Finally, we have made typographic corrections in andSection;andSection; 5.21(a),5.45(b)(3), 5.45(c), 5.65 (introductory text), and 5.65(b)(3). The Secretary finds that there is good cause to have the changes (otherthan those in andSection;andSection; 5.5 (definition of ``representative ofthe news media''), 5.41 through 5.45, and 5.65(c) through (e)) take effectwithout notice and comment procedures. Some of these changes are purelytechnical corrections (typographical corrections, updating of addressesand phone numbers, and updating or organizational references). Some areelimination of superfluous language. One (the definition of ``request''in andSection; 5.5), is an interpretative provision, and it merely conformsthis regulation to another regulation already in effect. One (the changerespecting oral requests in andSection; 5.21(a)) affects only our internalprocedures. These changes are insignificant in impact, and use of noticeand comment procedures is unnecessary.The Secretary has determined that this regulation is not a major rule withinthe meaning of E.O. 12291 because it will not have an effect on the economyof $100 million or more or otherwise meet the threshold criteria. Therefore,the preparation of a regulatory impact analysis is not required.The Secretary certifies that this regulation will not have a significanteconomic impact on any substantial number of small entitities as definedby the Regulatory Flexibility Act, Pub. L. 96-354.This regulation does not require use of a form, nor does it otherwise involvea collection of information subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44U.S.C. 3501-3520.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 45 CFR Part 5 </ITAG>Freedom of information.For the reasons set out in the preamble, 45 CFR Part 5 is revised as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">Part 5_Freedom of Information Regulations </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart A_Basic Policy </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">5.1 Purpose. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">5.2 Policy. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">5.3 Scope. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">5.4 Relationship between the FOIA and the Privacy Act of 1974. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">5.5 Definitions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart B_Obtaining a Record </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">5.21 How to request records. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">5.22 Requests not handled under the FOIA. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">5.23 Referral of requests outside the Department. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">5.24 Responding to your request.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart C_Release and Denial of Records </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">5.31 Designation of authorized officials. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">5.32 Release of records. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">5.33 Denial of requests. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">5.34 Appeal of denials. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">5.35 Time limits.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart D_Fees </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">5.41 Fees to be charged_categories of requests. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">5.42 Fees to be charged_general provisions. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">5.43 Fee schedule. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">5.44 Procedures for assessing and collecting fees. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">5.45 Waiver or reduction of fees. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart E_Records Available for Public Inspection </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">5.51 Records available. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">5.52 Indexes of records. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart F_Reasons for Withholding Some Records </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">5.61 General. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">5.62 Exemption one: National defense and foreign policy. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">5.63 Exemption two: Internal personnel rules and practices. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">5.64 Exemption three: Records exempted by other statutes. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">5.65 Exemption four: Trade secrets and confidential commercial orfinancial information. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">5.66 Exemption five: Internal memoranda. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">5.67 Exemption six: Clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">5.68 Exemption seven: Law enforcement. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">5.69 Exemptions 8 and 9: Records on financial institutions; recordson wells.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> 5 U.S.C. 552, 18 U.S.C. 1905, 31 U.S.C. 9701, 42 U.S.C.1306(c), E.O. 12600.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart A_Basic Policy</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 51.1</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Purpose.</ITAG>This part contains the rules that the Department of Health and Human Services(HHS) follows in handling requests for records under the Freedom of InformationAct (FOIA).

In addition, we recognize the legitimate interests of organizationsor persons who have submitted records to the Department or who would otherwisebe affected by release of records. For example, we have no discretion torelease certain records, such as trade secrets and confidential commercialinformation, prohibited from release by law. This policy calls for thefullest responsible disclosure consistent with those requirements of administrativenecessity and confidentiality which are recognized in the Freedom of InformationAct.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 5.3</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Scope.</ITAG>These rules apply to all components of the Department. Some units may establishadditional rules because of unique program requirements, but such rulesmust be consistent with these rules and must have the concurrence of theAssistant Secretary for Public Affairs. Existing implementing rules remainin effect to the extent that they are consistent with the new Departmentalregulation. If additional rules are issued, they will be published in the<T4>Federal Register</T4>, and you may get copies from our Freedom of informationOfficers.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 5.4</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Relationship between the FOIA and the Privacy Act of 1974.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Coverage. </T3>The FOIA and this rule apply to all HHS records. ThePrivacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a, applies to records that are about individuals,but only if the records are in a system of records. ``Individuals'' and``system of records'' are defined in the Privacy Act and in our PrivacyAct regulation, Part 5b of this title.(b) <T3>Requesting your own records. </T3>If you are an individual and requestrecords, then to the extent you are requesting your own records in a systemof records, we will handle your request under the Privacy Act and Part5b. If there is any record that we need not release to you under thoseprovisions, we will also consider your request under the FOIA and thisrule, and we will release the record to you if the FOIA requires it.(c) <T3>Requesting another individual's record. </T3>Whether or not you arean individual, if you request records that are about an individual (otherthan yourself) and that are in a system of records, we will handle yourrequest under the FOIA and this rule. (However, if our disclosure in responseto your request would be permitted by the Privacy Act's disclosure provision,5 U.S.C. 552a(b), for reasons other than the requirements of the FOIA,and if we decide to make the disclosure, then we will not handle your requestunder the FOIA and this rule. For example, when we make routine use disclosurespursuant to requests, we do not handle them under the FOIA and this rule.``Routine use'' is defined in the Privacy Act and in Part 5b). If we handleyour request under the FOIA and this rule and the FOIA does not requirereleasing the record to you, then the Privacy Act may prohibit the releaseand remove our discretion to release.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 5.5</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Definitions.</ITAG>As used in this part,``Agency'' means any executive department, military department, governmentcorporation, government controlled corporation, or other establishmentin the executive branch of the Federal Government, or any independent regulatoryagency. Thus, HHS is an agency. A private organization is not an agencyeven if it is performing work under contract with the Government or isreceiving Federal financial assistance. Grantee and contractor recordsare not subject to the FOIA unless they are in the possession or underthe control of HHS or its agents, such as Medicare health insurance carriersand intermediaries.``Commercial use'' means, when referring to a request, that the requestis from or on behalf of one who seeks information for a use or purposethat furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests of the requesteror of a person on whose behalf the request is made. Whether a request isfor a commercial use depends on the purpose of the request and the useto which the records will be put; the identity of the requester (individual,non-profit corporation, for-profit corporation), on the nature of the records,while in some cases indicative of that purpose or use, is not necessarilydeterminative. When a request is from a representative of the news media,a purpose or use supporting the requester's news dissemination functionis not a commercial use.``Department'' or ``HHS'' means the Department of Health and Human Services.It includes Medicare health insurance carriers and intermediaries to theextent they are performing functions under agreements entered into undersections 1816 and 1842 of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1395h, 1395u.``Duplication'' means the process of making a copy of a record and sendingit to the requester, to the extent necessary to respond to the request.Such copies include paper copy, microform, audio-visual materials, andmagnetic tapes, cards, and discs.``Educational institution'' means a preschool, elementary or secondaryschool, institution of undergraduate or graduate higher education, or institutionof professional or vocational education, which operates a program of scholarlyresearch.``Freedom of Information Act'' or ``FOIA'' means section 552 of Title 5,United States Code, as amended.``Freedom of Information Officer'' means an HHS official who has been delegatedthe authority to release or withhold records and assess, waive, or reducefees in response to FOIA requests.``Non-commercial scientific institution'' means an institution that isnot operated substantially for purposes of furthering its own or someoneelse's business, trade, or profit interests, and that is operated for purposesof conducting scientific research whose results are not intended to promoteany particular product or industry.``Records'' means any handwritten, typed, or printed documents (such asmemoranda, books, brochures, studies, writings, drafts, letters, transcripts,and minutes) and documentary material in other forms (such as punchcards;magnetic tapes, cards, or discs; paper tapes; audio or video recordings;maps; photographs; slides; microfilm; and motion pictures). It does notinclude objects or articles such as exhibits, models, equipment, and duplicationmachines or audiovisual processing materials. Nor does it include books,magazines, pamphlets, or other reference material in formally organizedand officially designated HHS libraries, where such materials are availableunder the rules of the particular library.``Representative of the news media'' means a person actively gatheringinformation for an entity organized and operated to publish or broadcastnews to the public. News media entities include television and radio broadcasters,publishers of periodicals who distribute their products to the generalpublic or who make their products available for purchase or subscriptionby the general public, and entities that may disseminate news through othermedia (e.g., electronic dissemination of text). We will treat freelancejournalists as representatives of a new media entity if they can show alikelihood of publication through such an entity. A publication contractis such a basis, and the requester's past publication record may show sucha basis.``Request'' means asking for records, whether or not you refer specificallyto the Freedom of Information Act. Requests from Federal agencies and courtorders for documents are not included within this definition. Subpoenasare requests only to the extent provided by Part 2 of this title.``Review'' means, when used in connection with processing records for acommercial use request, examining the records to determine what portions,if any, may be withheld, and any other processing that is necessary toprepare the records for release. It includes only the examining and processingthat are done the first time we analyze whether a specific exemption appliesto a particular record or portion of a record. It does not include examinationdone in the appeal stage with respect to an exemption that was appliedat the initial request stage. However, if we initially withhold a recordunder one exemption, and on appeal we determine that that exemption doesnot apply, then examining the record in the appeal stage for the purposeof determining whether a different exemption applies is included in ``review.''It does not include the process of researching or resolving general legalor policy issues regarding exemptions.``Search'' means looking for records or portions of records responsiveto a request. It includes reading and interpreting a request, and alsopage-by-page and line-by-line examination to identify responsive portionsof a document. However, it does not include line-by-line examination wheremerely duplicating the entire page would be a less expensive and quickerway to comply with the request.<ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart B_Obtaining a Record</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;5.21 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">How to request records.</ITAG>(a) <T3>General.</T3> Our policy is to answer all requests, both oral and written,for records. However, in order to have the rights given you by the FOIAand by this regulation (for example, the right to appeal if we deny yourrequest and the right to have our decisions reviewed in court), you musteither make your request in writing or make it orally to a Freedom of InformationOfficer. Freedom of Information Officers and their staffs may put in writingany oral requests they receive directly.(b) <T3>Addressing requests.</T3> It will help us to handle your request soonerif you address it to the Freedom of Imformation Officer in the HHS unitthat is most likely to have the records you want. (See andSection;5.31 ofthis Part for a list of Freedom of Information Officers.) If you cannotdetermine this, send the request to: HHS Freedom of Information Officer,645-F, Hubert H. Humphrey Building, Department of Health and Human Services,200 Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20201. Write the words ``Freedomof Information Act Request'' on the envelope and letter.(c) <T3>Details in the letter.</T3> You should provide details that will helpus identify and find the records you are requesting. If there is insufficientinformation, we will ask you for more. Include your telephone number(s)to help us reach you if we have questions. If you are not sure how to writeyour request or what details to include, communicate with a Freedom ofInformation Officer.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;5.22 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Requests not handled under the FOIA.</ITAG>(a) We will not handle your request under the FOIA and this regulationto the extent it asks for records that are currently available, eitherfrom HHS or from another part of the Federal Government, under a statutethat provides for charging fees for those records. For example, we willnot handle your request under the FOIA and this regulation to the extentit asks for detailed earnings statements under the Social Security program,or records currently available from the Government Printing Office of theNational Technical Information Service.(b) We will not handle your request under the FOIA and this regulationto the extent it asks for records that are distributed by an HHS programoffice as part of its regular program activity, for example, health educationbrochures distributed by the Public Health Service or public informationleaflets distributed by the Social Security Administration.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;5.23 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Referral of requests outside the Department.</ITAG>If you request records that were created by, or provided to us by, anotherFederal agency, and if that agency asserts control over the records, wemay refer the records and your request to that agency. We may likewiserefer requests for classified records to the agency that classified them.In these cases, the other agency will process and respond to your request,to the extent it concerns those records, under that agency's regulation,and you need not make a separate request to that agency. We will notifyyou when we refer your request to another agency.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;5.24 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Responding to your request.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Retrieving records.</T3> The Department is required to furnish copiesof records only when they are in our possession or we can retrieve themfrom storage. If we have stored the records you want in the National Archivesor another storage center, we will retrieve and review them for possibledisclosure. However, the Federal Government destroys many old records,so sometimes it is impossible to fill requests. Various laws, regulations,and manuals give the time periods for keeping records before they may bedestroyed. For example, there is information about retention of recordsin the Records Disposal Act of 1944, 44 U.S.C. 3301 through 3314; the FederalProperty Management Regulations, 41 CFR 101-11.4; the General Records Schedulesof the National Archives and Records Administration; and in the HHS Handbook:<T3>Files Maintenance and Records Disposition</T3>.(b) <T3>Furnishing records.</T3> The requirement is that we furnish copiesonly of records that we have or can retrieve. We are not compelled to createnew records. For example, we are not required to write a new program sothat a computer will print information in the format you prefer. However,if the requested information is maintained in computerized form, but wecan, with minimal computer instructions, produce the information on paper,we will do this if it is the only way to respond to a request. Nor arewe required to perform research for you. On the other hand, we may decideto conserve government resources and at the same time supply the recordsyou need by consolidating information from various records rather thancopying them all. Moreover, we are required to furnish only one copy ofa record and usually impose that limit. If information exists in differentforms, we will provide the record in the form that best conserves governmentresources. For example, if it requires less time and expense to providea computer record as a paper printout rather than in an electronic medium,we will provide the printout.<ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart C_Release and Denial of Records</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 5.31</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Designation of authorized officials.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Freedom of Information Officers.</T3> To provide coordination and consistencyin responding to FOIA requests, only Freedom of Information Officers havethe authority to release or deny records.

However, we will not release it to you if a statute forbidsthis disclosure, and we will not necessarily release it to you if an exemptionapplies in your situation and did not apply, or applied differently, inthe previous situations. (b) <T3>Unauthorized disclosure. </T3>The principle stated in paragraph (a)of this section, does not apply if the previous release was unauthorized.(c) <T3>Poor copy. </T3>If we cannot make a legible copy of a record to bereleased, we do not attempt to reconstruct it.

(b) <T3>Unproductive searches.</T3> We make a diligent search for records tosatisfy your request. Nevertheless, we may not be able always to find therecords you want using the information you provided, or they may not exist.If we advise you that we have been unable to find the records despite adiligent search, this does not constitute a denial of your request.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 5.34 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Appeal of denials.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Right of appeal.</T3> You have the right to appeal a partial or fulldenial of your FOIA request. To do so, you must put your appeal in writingand send it to the review official identified in the denial letter. Youmust send your appeal within 30 days from the date you receive that letteror from the date you receive the records released as a partial grant ofyour request, whichever is later.(b) <T3>Letter of appeal.</T3> The appeal letter should state reasons why youbelieve that the FOIA exemption(s) we cited do not apply to the recordsthat you requested, or give reasons why they should be released regardlessof whether the exemption(s) apply. Because we have some discretionary authorityin deciding whether to release or withhold records, you may strengthenyour request by explaining your reasons for wanting the records. However,you are not required to give any explanation.(c) <T3>Review process.</T3> Before making a decision on an appeal of a denial,the designated review official will consult with the General Counsel toensure that the rights and interests of all parties affected by the requestare protected. Also, the concurrence of the Assistant Secretary for PublicAffairs is required in all appeal decisions, including those on fees. Whenthe review official responds to an appeal, that constitutes the Department'sfinal action on the request. If the review official grants your appeal,we will send the records to you promptly or let you inspect them, or elsewe will explain the reason for any delay and the approximate date you willreceive copies or be allowed to inspect the records. If the decision isto deny your appeal, the official will state the reasons for the decisionin writing and inform you of the FOIA provision for judicial review. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 5.35 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Time limits.</ITAG>(a) <T3>General.</T3> FOIA sets certain time limits for us to decide whetherto disclose the records you requested, and to decide appeals. If we failto meet the deadlines, you may proceed as if we had denied your requestor your appeal. We will try diligently to comply with the time limits,but if it appears that processing your request may take longer than wewould wish, we will acknowledge your request and tell you its status. Sincerequests may be misaddressed or misrouted, you should call or write toconfirm that we have the request and to learn its status if you have notheard from us in a reasonable time.(b) <T3>Time allowed.</T3> (1) We will decide whether to release records within10 working days after your request reaches the appropriate FOI office,as identified in andSection; 5.31 of this part. When we decide to releaserecords, we will actually provide the records, or let you inspect them,as soon as possible after that decision.(2) We will decide an appeal within 20 working days after the appeal reachesthe appropriate review official(c) <T3>Extension of time limits.</T3> FOI Officers of review officials mayextend the time limits in unusual circumstances. Extension at the requeststage and at the appeal stage may total up to 10 working days. We willnotify you in writing of any extension. ``Unusual circumstances'' includesituations when we:(1) Search for and collect records from field facilites, archives, or locationsother than the office processing the request.(2) Search for, collect, or examine a great many records in response toa single request.(3) Consult with another office or agency that has substantial interestin the determination of the request.(4) Conduct negotiations with submitters and requesters of informationto determine the nature and extent of non-disclosable proprietary materials.<ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart D_Fees</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 5.41 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Fees to be charged_categories of requests.</ITAG>The paragraphs below state, for each category of request, the type of feesthat we will generally charge. However, for each of these categories, thefees may be limited, waived, or reduced for the reasons given in andSection;andSection;5.42 through 5.45 or for other reasons.(a) <T3>Commercial use request.</T3> If your request is for a commercial use,HHS will charge you the costs of search, review, and duplication.(b) <T3>Educational and scientific institutions and news media. </T3>If youare an educational institution or a non-commercial scientific institution,operated primarily for scholarly or scientific research, or a representativeof the news media, and your request is not for a commercial use, HHS willcharge you only for the duplication of documents. Also, HHS will not chargeyou the copying costs for the first 100 pages of duplication.(c) <T3>Other requesters.</T3> If your request is not the kind described byparagraph (a) or (b) of this section, then HHS will charge you only forthe search and the duplication. Also, we will not charge you for the firsttwo hours of search time or for the copying costs of the first 100 pagesof duplication.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 5.42 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Fees to be charged_general provisions.</ITAG>(a) We may charge search fees even if the records we find are exempt fromdisclosure, or even if we do not find any records at all.(b) If we are not charging you for the first two hours of search time,under andSection; 5.41(c), and those two hours are spent on a computer search,then the two free hours are the first two hours of the operator's own operation.If the operator spends less than two hours on the search, we well reducethe total search fees by the average hourly rate for the operator's time,multipled by two.(c) If we are not charging you for the first 100 pages of duplication,under andSection; 5.41 (b) or (c), then those 100 pages are the first 100pages of photocopies of standard size pages, or the first 100 pages ofcomputer printout. If we cannot use this method to calculate the fee reduction,then we will reduce your total duplication fee by the normal charge forphotocopying a standard size page, multiplied by 100.(d) We will not charge you any fee at all if the costs of routine collectionand processing of the fee are likely to equal or exceed the amount of thefee. As of May 1987, such costs among the units HHS ranged between $6.00and $12.50.(e) If we determine that you (acting either alone or together with others)are breaking down a single request into a series of requests in order toavoid (or reduce) the fees charged, we may aggregate all these requestsfor purposes of calculating the fees charged.(f) We will charge interest on unpaid bills beginning on the 31st day followingthe day the bill was sent. We will use the provisions of Part 30 of thisTitle in assessing interest, administrative costs, and penalties and intaking actions to encourage payment.(g) This subpart does not apply to requests for Social Security programrecords on Social Security number holders, wage earners, employers, andclaimants, where the requests are governed by section 1106 of the SocialSecurity Act, 42 U.S.C. 1306(c), and by 20 CFR 442.441.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 5.43</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Fee schedule</ITAG>HHS charges the following fees:(a) Manual searching for or reviewing of records_when the search or reviewis performed by employees at grade GS-1 through GS-8, an hourly rate basedon the salary of a GS-5, step 7, employee; when done by a GS-9 throughGS-14, an hourly rate based on the salary of a GS-12, step 4, employee;and when done by a GS-15 or above, an hourly rate based on the salary ofa GS-15, step 7, employee. In each case, the hourly rate will be computedby taking the current hourly rate for the specified grade and step, adding16% of that rate to cover benefits, and rounding to the nearest whole dollar.As of November 25, 1988, these rates were $10, $20, and $37 respectively.When a search involves employees at more than one of these levels, we willcharge the rate appropriate for each.(b) Computer searching and printing_the actual cost of operating the computerplus charges for the time spent by the operator, at the rates given inparagraph (a) of this section.(c) Photocopying standard size pages_$0.10 per page. FOI Officers may chargelower fees for particular documents where_(1) The document has already been printed in large numbers,(2) The program office determines that using existing stock to answer thisrequest, and any other anticipated FOI requests, will not interfere withprogram requirements, and(3) The FOI Officer determines that the lower fee is adequate to recoverthe prorated share of the original printing costs.(d) Photocopying odd-size documents (such as punchcards or blueprints),or reproducing other records (such as tapes)_the actual costs of operatingthe machine, plus the actual cost of the materials used, plus charges forthe time spent by the operator, at the rates given in paragraph (a) ofthis section.(e) Certifying that records are true copies. This service is not requiredby the FOIA. If we agree to provide it, we will charge $10 per certification.(f) Sending records by express mail, certified mail, or other special methods.This service is not required by the FOIA. If we agree to provide it, wewill charge our actual costs.(g) Performing any other special service that you request and we agreeto_actual costs of operating any machinery, plus actual cost of any materialsused, plus charges for the time of our employees, at the rates given inparagraph (a) of this section.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 5.44</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Procedures for assessing and collecting fees.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Agreement to pay.</T3> We generally assume that when you request recordsyou are willing to pay the fees we charge for services associated withyour request. You may specify a limit on the amount you are willing tospend. We will notify you if it appears that the fees will exceed the limitand ask whether you nevertheless want us to proceed with the search.(b) <T3>Advance payment.</T3> If you have failed to pay previous bills in atimely fashion, or if our initial review of your request indicates thatwe will charge you fees exceeding $250, we will require you to pay yourpast due fees and/or the estimated fees, or a deposit, before we startsearching for the records you want. If so, we will let you know promptlyupon receiving your request. In such cases, the administrative time limitsprescribed in andSection; 5.35 of the part (i.e., ten working days from receiptof initial requests and 20 working days from receipt of appeals from initialdenials, plus permissible extensions of these time limits) will begin onlyafter we come to an agreement with you over payment of fees, or decidethat fee waiver or reduction is appropriate.(c) <T3>Billing and payment.</T3> We will normally require you to pay all feesbefore we furnish the records to you. We may, at our discretion, send youa bill along with or following the furnishing of the records. For example,we may do this if you have a history of prompt payment. We may also, atour discretion, aggregate the charges for certain time periods in orderto avoid sending numerous small bills to frequent requesters, or to businessesor agents representing requesters. For example, we might send a bill tosuch a requester once a month. Fees should be paid in accordance with theinstructions furnished by the person who responds to your requests.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 5.45</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Waiver or reduction of fees.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Standard. </T3>We will waive or reduce the fees we would otherwisecharge if disclosure of the information meets both of the following tests:(1) It is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantlyto public understanding of the operations or activities of the government,and(2) It is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.These two tests are explained in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.(b) <T3>Public interest.</T3> The disclosure passes the first test only ifit furthers the specific public interest of being likely to contributesignificantly to public understanding of government operations or activities,regardless of any other public interest it may further. In analyzing thisquestion, we will consider the following factors.(1) How, if at all, do the records to be disclosed pertain to the operationsor activities of the Federal Government?(2) Would disclosure of the records reveal any meaningful information aboutgovernment operations or activities? Can one learn from these records anythingabout such operations that is not already public knowledge?(3) Will the disclosure advance the understanding of the general publicas distinguished from a narrow segment of interested persons? Under thisfactor we may consider whether the requester is in a position to contributeto public understanding. For example, we may consider whether the requesterhas such knowledge or expertise as may be necessary to understand the information,and whether the requester's intended use of the information would be likelyto disseminate the information among the public. An unsupported claim tobe doing research for a book or article does not demonstrate that likelihood,while such a claim by a representative of the news media is better evidence.(4) Will the contribution to public understanding be a significant one?Will the public's understanding of the government's operations be substantiallygreater as a result of the disclosure?(c) <T3>Not primarily in the requester's commercial interest.</T3> If the disclosurepasses the test of furthering the specific public interest described inparagraph (b) of this section, we will determine whether it also furthersthe requester's commercial interest and, if so, whether this effect outweighsthe advancement of that public interest. In applying this second test,we will consider the following factors:(1) Would the disclosure further a commercial interest of the requester,or of someone on whose behalf the requester is acting? ``Commercial interests''include interests relating to business, trade, and profit. Not only profit-makingcorporations have commercial interests_so do nonprofit corporations, individuals,unions, and other associations. The interest of a representative of thenews media in using the information for news dissemination purposes willnot be considered a commercial interest.(2) If disclosure would further a commercial interest of the requester,would that effect outweigh the advancement of the public interest definedin paragraph (b) of this section? Which effect is primary?(d) <T3>Deciding between waiver and reduction.</T3> If the disclosure passesboth tests, we will normally waive fees. However, in some cases we maydecide only to reduce the fees. For example, we may do this when disclosureof some but not all of the requested records passes the tests.(e) <T3>Procedure for requesting a waiver or reduction.</T3> You must makeyour request for a waiver or reduction at the same time you make your requestfor records. You should explain why you believe a waiver or reduction isproper under the analysis in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section.Only FOI Officers may make the decision whether to waive, or reduce, thefees. If we do not completely grant your request for a waiver or reduction,the denial letter will designate a review official. You may appeal thedenial to that official. In your appeal letter, you should discuss whateverreasons are given in our denial letter. The process prescribed in andSection;5.34(c)of this part will also apply to these appeals.<ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart E_Records Available for Public Inspection</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;5.51</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Records available.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Records of general interest.</T3> We will make the following recordsof general interest available for your inspection and copying. Before releasingthem, however, we may delete the names of people, or information that wouldidentify them, if release would invade their personal privacy to a clearlyunwarranted degree. (See andSection;5.67 of this part.)(1) Orders and final opinions, including concurring and dissenting opinionsin adjudications, such as Letters of Finding issued by the Office for CivilRights in civil rights complaints, and Social Security Rulings.

For assistance in locating indexes maintained in the Department, youmay contact the HHS Freedom of Information Officer at the address and telephonenumber in andSection;5.31(c).(b) <T3>Record citation as precedent.</T3> We will not use or cite any recorddescribed in andSection;5.51(a) as a precedent for an action against a personunless we have indexed the record and published it or made it available,or unless the person has timely notice of the record.<ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart F_Reasons for Withholding Some Records</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;5.61</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">General.</ITAG>Section 552(b) of the Freedom of Information Act contains nine exemptionsto the mandatory disclosure of records.

Whenthe release of certain records may adversely affect U.S. relations withforeign countries, we usually consult with officials of those countriesor officials of the Department of State. Also, we may on occasion havein our possession records classified by some other agency. We may referyour request for such records to the agency that classified them and notifyyou that we have done so, as explained in andSection; 5.23.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 5.63</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Exemption two: Internal personnel rules and practices.</ITAG>We are not required to release records that are ``related solely to theinternal personnel rules and practices of an agency.'' Under this exemption,we may withhold routine internal agency practices and procedures. For example,we may withhold guard schedules and rules governing parking facilitiesor lunch periods. Also under this exemption, we may withhold internal recordswhose release would help some persons circumvent the law or agency regulations.For example, we ordinarily do not disclose manuals that instruct our investigatorsor auditors how to investigate possible violations of law, to the extentthat this release would help some persons circumvent the law.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 5.64</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Exemption three: Records exempted by other statutes.</ITAG>We are not required to release records if another statute specificallyallows us to withhold them. We may use another statute to justify withholdingonly if it absolutely prohibits disclosure or if it sets forth criteriato guide our decision on releasing or identifies particular types of materialto be withheld.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 5.65</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Exemption four: Trade secrets and confidential commercial or financialinformation.</ITAG>We will withhold trade secrets and commercial or financial informationthat is obtained from a person and is privileged or confidential.(a) <T3>Trade secrets. </T3>A trade secret is a secret, commercially valuableplan, formula, process, or device that is used for the making, preparing,compounding, or processing of trade commodities and that can be said tobe the end product of either innovation or substantial effort. There mustbe a direct relationship between the trade secret and the productive process.(b) <T3>Commercial or financial information. </T3>We will not disclose recordswhose information is ``commercial or financial,'' is obtained from a person,and is ``privileged or confidential.''(1) Information is ``commercial or financial'' if it relates to businesses,commerce, trade, employment, profits, or finances (including personal finances).We interpret this category broadly.(2) Information is ``obtained from a person'' if HHS or another agencyhas obtained it from someone outside the Federal Government or from someonewithin the Government who has a commercial or financial interest in theinformation. ``Person'' includes an individual, partnership, corporation,association, state or foreign government, or other organization. Informationis not ``obtained from a person'' if it is generated by HHS or anotherfederal agency. However, information is ``obtained from a person'' if itis provided by someone, including but not limited to an agency employee,who retains a commercial or financial interest in the information.(3) Information is ``privileged'' if it would ordinarily be protected fromdisclosure in civil discovery by a recognized evidentiary privilege, suchas the attorney-client privilege or the work product privilege. Informationmay be privileged for this purpose under a privilege belonging to a personoutside the government, unless the providing of the information to thegovernment rendered the information no longer protectable in civil discovery.(4) Information is ``confidential'' if it meets one of the following tests:(i) Disclosure may impair the government's ability to obtain necessaryinformation in the future;(ii) Disclosure would substantially harm the competitive position of theperson who submitted the information;(iii) Disclosure would impair other government interests, such as programeffectiveness and compliance; or(iv) Disclosure would impair other private interests, such as an interestin controlling availability of intrinsically valuable records, which aresold in the market by their owner.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The following questions may be relevant in analyzing whether a recordmeets one of more of the above tests: Is the information of a type customarilyheld in strict confidence and not disclosed to the public by the personto whom it belongs? What is the general custom or usage with respect tosuch information in the relevant occupation or business? How many, andwhat types of, individuals have access to the information? What kind anddegree of financial injury can be expected if the information is disclosed?(c) <T3>Designation of certain confidential information. </T3>A person whosubmits records to the government may designate part or all of the informationin such records as exempt from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the FOIA.The person may make this designation either at the time the records aresubmitted to the government or within a reasonable time thereafter. Thedesignation must be in writing. Where a legend is required by a requestfor proposals or request for quotations, pursuant to 48 CFR 352.215-12,then that legend is necessary for this purpose. Any such designation willexpire ten years after the records were submitted to the government.(d) <T3>Predisclosure notification. </T3>The procedures in this paragraph applyto records on which the submitter has designated information as providedin paragraph (c) of this section. They also apply to records that weresubmitted to the government where we have substantial reason to believethat information in the records could reasonably be considered exempt underExemption 4. Certain exceptions to these procedures are stated in paragraph(e) of this section.(1) When we receive a request for such records, and we determine that wemay be required to disclose them, we will make reasonable efforts to notifythe submitter about these facts. The notice will include a copy of therequest, and it will inform the submitter about the procedures and timelimits for submission and consideration of objections to disclosure. Ifwe must notify a large number of submitters, we may do this by postingor publishing a notice in a place where the submitters are reasonably likelyto become aware of it.(2) The submitter has five working days from receipt of the notice to objectto disclosure of any part of the records and to state all bases for itsobjections.(3) We will give consideration to all bases that have been timely statedby the submitter. If we decide to disclose the records, we will notifythe submitter in writing. This notice will briefly explain why we did notsustain its objections. We will include with the notice a copy of the recordsabout which the submitter objected, as we propose to disclose them. Thenotice will state that we intend to disclose the records five working daysafter the submitter receives the notice unless we are ordered by a UnitedStates District Court not to release them.(4) When a requester files suit under the FOIA to obtain records coveredby this paragraph, we will promptly notify the submitter.(5) Whenever we send a notice to a submitter under paragraph (d)(1) ofthis section, we will notify the requester that we are giving the submittera notice and an opportunity to object. Whenever we send a notice to a submitterunder paragraph (d)(3) of this section, we will notify the requester ofthis fact.(e) <T3>Exceptions to predisclosure notification.</T3> The notice requirementsin paragraph (d) of this section do not apply in the following situations:(1) We decided not to disclose the records;(2) The information has previously been published or made generally available;(3) Disclosure is required by a regulation, issued after notice and opportunityfor public comment, that specifies narrow categories of records that areto be disclosed under the FOIA, but in this case a submitter may stilldesignate records as described in paragraph (c) of this section, and inexceptional cases, we may, at our discretion, follow the notice proceduresin paragraph (d) of this section; or(5) The designation appears to be obviously frivolous, but in this casewe will still give the submitter the written notice required by paragraph(d)(3) of this section (although this notice need not explain our decisionor include a copy of the records), and we will notify the requester asdescribed in paragraph (d)(5) of this section.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 5.66 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Exemption five: Internal memoranda.</ITAG>This exemption covers internal government communications and notes thatfall within a generally recognized evidentiary privilege. Internal governmentcommunications include an agency's communications with an outside consultantor other outside person, with a court, or with Congress, when those communicationsare for a purpose similar to the purpose of privileged intra-agency communications.Some of the most-commonly applicable privileges are described in the followingparagraphs.(a) <T3>Deliberative process privilege.</T3> This privilege protects predecisionaldeliberative communications. A communication is protected under this privilegeif it was made before a final decision was reached on some question ofpolicy and if it expressed recommendations or opinions on that question.The purpose of the privilege is to prevent injury to the quality of theagency decisionmaking process by encouraging open and frank internal policydiscussions, by avoiding premature disclosure of policies not yet adopted,and by avoiding the public confusion that might result from disclosingreasons that were not in fact the ultimate grounds for an agency's decision.Purely factual material in a deliberative document is within this privilegeonly if it is inextricably intertwined with the deliberative portions sothat it cannot reasonably be segregated, if it would reveal the natureof the deliberative portions, or if its disclosure would in some otherway make possible an intrusion into the decisionmaking process. We willrelease purely factual material in a deliberative docment unless that materialis otherwise exempt. The privilege continues to protect predecisional documentseven after a decision is made.(b) <T3>Attorney work product privilege.</T3> This privilege protects documentsprepared by or for an agency, or by or for its representative (typically,HHS attorneys) in anticipation of litigation or for trial. It includesdocuments prepared for purposes of administrative adjudications as wellas court litigation. It includes documents prepared by program officesas well as by attorneys. It includes factual material in such documentsas well as material revealing opinions and tactics. Finally, the privilegecontinues to protect the documents even after the litigation is closed.(c) <T3>Attorney-client communication privilege.</T3> This privilege protectsconfidential communications between a lawyer and an employee or agent ofthe government where there is an attorney-client relationship between them(typically, where the lawyer is acting as attorney for the agency and theemployee is communicating on behalf of the agency) and where the employeehas communicated information to the attorney in confidence in order toobtain legal advice or assistance.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 5.67</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Exemption six: Clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Documents affected. </T3>We may withhold records about individualsif disclosure would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of theirpersonal privacy.(b) <T3>Balancing test. </T3>In deciding whether to release records to youthat contain personal or private information about someone else, we weighthe foreseeable harm of invading that person's privacy against the publicbenefit that would result from the release. If you were seeking informationfor a purely commercial venture, for example, we might not think that disclosurewould primarily benefit the public and we would deny your request. On theother hand, we would be more inclined to release information if you wereworking on a research project that gave promise of providing valuable informationto a wide audience. However, in our evaluation of requests for recordswe attempt to guard against the release of information that might involvea violation of personal privacy because of a requester being able to ``readbetween the lines'' or piece together items that would constitute informationthat normally would be exempt from mandatory disclosure under ExemptionSix.(c) <T3>Examples. </T3>Some of the information that we frequently withholdunder Exemption Six is: Home addresses, ages, and minority group statusof our employees or former employees; social security numbers; medicalinformation about individuals participating in clinical research studies;names and addresses of individual beneficiaries of our programs, or benefitssuch individuals receive; earning records, claim files, and other personalinformation maintained by the Social Security Administration, the PublicHealth Service, and the Health Care Financing Administration.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 5.68</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Exemption seven: Law enforcement.</ITAG>We are not required to disclose information or records that the governmenthas compiled for law enforcement purposes. The records may apply to actualor potential violations of either criminal or civil laws or regulations.We can withhold these records only to the extent that releasing them wouldcause harm in at least one of the following situations:(a) <T3>Enforcement proceedings. </T3>We may withhold information whose releasecould reasonably be expected to interfere with prospective or ongoing lawenforcement proceedings. Investigations of fraud and mismanagement, employeemisconduct, and civil rights violations may fall into this category. Incertain cases_such as when a fraud investigation is likely_we may refuseto confirm or deny the existence of records that relate to the violationsin order not to disclose that an investigation is in progress, or may beconducted.(b) <T3>Fair trial or impartial adjudication. </T3>We may withhold recordswhose release would deprive a person of a fair trial or an impartial adjudicationbecause of prejudicial publicity.(c) <T3>Personal privacy. </T3>We are careful not to disclose information thatcould reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personalprivacy. When a name surfaces in an investigation, that person is likelyto be vulnerable to innuendo, rumor, harassment, and retaliation.(d) <T3>Confidential sources and information. </T3>We may withhold recordswhose release could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity ofa confidential source of information. A confidential source may be an individual;a state, local, or foreign government agency; or any private organization.The exemption applies whether the source provides information under anexpress promise of confidentiality or under circumstances from which suchan assurance could be reasonably inferred. Also, where the record, or informationin it, has been compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority conductinga criminal investigation, or by an agency conducting a lawful nationalsecurity investigation, the exemption also protects all information suppliedby a confidential source. Also protected from mandatory disclosure is anyinformation which, if disclosed, could reasonably be expected to jeopardizethe system of confidentiality that assures a flow of information from sourcesto investigatory agencies.(e) <T3>Techniques and procedures. </T3>We may withhold records reflectingspecial techniques or procedures of investigation or prosecution, not otherwisegenerally known to the public. In some cases, it is not possible to describeeven in general terms those techniques without disclosing the very materialto be withheld. We may also withhold records whose release would discloseguidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if this disclosurecould reasonably be expected to create a risk that someone could circumventrequirements of law or of regulation.(f) <T3>Life and physical safety. </T3>We may withhold records whose disclosurecould reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety ofany individual. This protection extends to threats and harassment as wellas to physical violence.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 5.69</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Exemptions 8 and 9: Records on financial institutions; records onwells.</ITAG>Exemption eight permits us to withhold records about regulation or supervisionof financial institutions.
