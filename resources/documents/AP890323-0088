The FCC on Wednesday directed local exchange carriers to filerevisions to their interstate access rates to be effective April 1.   The local companies last Dec. 30 proposed reductions of $489million in the charges they levy on ATandamp;T and other long-distancecarriers to connect with the local phone networks.   The FCC said that based upon data collected since their Decemberfiling, the local companies had understated expected demand andcosts.   ATandamp;T last month proposed a $533 million reduction in rateseffective April 1 to reflect the anticipated lower charges it wouldhave to pay the local companies.   The $533 million cut also reflected savings to ATandamp;T from thescheduled April 1 increase in the so-called subscriber line chargethat residential and small business customers pay to maintain thelocal phone system. That charge rises by 30 cents a month to $3.50on April 1.   With residential and business users paying more, ATandamp;T has to payless, and the FCC requires ATandamp;T to pass those savings along to itscustomers. ATandamp;T's long-distance competitors generally have followedsuit.   It was not immediately clear how much ATandamp;T would have to adjustits proposed cuts on April 1.   That reduction would be the eighth for ATandamp;T since 1984, when thecompany shed its local operating companies.   ATandamp;T's rates have dropped about 39 percent during that period.</TEXT></DOC>
