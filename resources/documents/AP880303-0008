Sofaer said in an interview.   The heart of the issue is not so much a treaty signed lastDecember banning medium-range nuclear missiles from superpowerarsenals as a treaty signed in 1972 which limits testing ofPresident Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative missile defensesystem, known as Star Wars.   Democratic Whip Alan Cranston of California has been holdingdiscussions with senators from both parties, and an aide said heexpects ``there to be language in the ratification resolutionaddressing the treaty interpretation issues.''   Cranston has predicted that the treaty will win the necessary 67votes in the 100-member body to be ratified.   Few senators have expressed disagreement over the meaning of theIntermediate-range Nuclear Forces pact signed at the Washingtonsummit last December calling on the superpowers to destroy theirnuclear missiles with ranges of 300 to 3,000 miles.   The central controversy is an interpretation of the ABM pactwritten by Sofaer in 1985 which would allow wider testing of StarWars components.   Cranston's legislative aide, Gerry Warburg, said the languageexpected in the INF resolution ``would contain a more broadstatement concerning the interpretation of treaties generally,''including the ABM pact.   Cranston, Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the chairman of the ArmedServices Committee, and Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., of the ForeignRelations Committee, all oppose Sofaer's ``broad interpretation''of the ABM pact. Warburg said they had been discussing the INFresolution with Secretary of State George P. Shultz.   The senators contend that allowing the broad interpretationamounts to changing the rules in the middle of the game and wouldset a dangerous precedent in which any administration could ducktreaty requirements simply by reinterpreting them.   Sofaer said inclusion of restrictive language in a resolutionratifying the INF treaty would not be binding on the Soviet Union,and could complicate rather than resolve interpretation of the ABMpact.   ``I know that they are not going to get a settlement of the ABMdispute this way,'' said Sofaer. ``It is a potential problem forINF ratification and I think overwhelmingly people support INFratification.''   Sofaer noted that Shultz had sent the Senate the 31-volumenegotiating record of the INF pact and had also agreed that anytestimony by administration officials would be ``authoritative''and reflect the president's understanding of the treaty.   ``Those practical things have been achieved,'' said Sofaer,objecting to including in the ratification resolution any languagethat would commit future administrations to the currentunderstanding of the treaty.   ``If you want to go further, you might end up confusing or evenharming international legal practice relating to treatyratification,'' he said.   While the Senate can bind the administration to a particularinterpretation of either the INF or the ABM treaties, he said, itcannot bind the Soviet Union, unless the treaties are renegotiated.   ``The treaty reflects two relationships,'' he said. ``Itreflects a relationship between two sovereign nations, and then italso reflects the relations between the United States executivebranch and the Senate.   ``When you talk about the meaning of a treaty, you are talkingabout the international relationship. You are talking about whatbinds the two nations.''</TEXT></DOC>
