Let's spend $30 on gas, $50 on food --more, if we count the drinks we'll need when this trip is over -- to save $10on a pair of sneakers. Let's do it, because if there's one thing we can'ttolerate it's paying full price.;   A maelstrom of traffic sucks us into theOutlet Hell parking lot and spits us out on its farthest reaches, where wejoust with dozens of other eager shoppers for the few remaining parkingspaces. Where did all these people come from? What are they doing here? Whatare we doing here?  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  IS THE MONEY YOU SAVE WORTH THE PRICE YOU PAY?  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  White writes for the Boston Globe.  </MEMO><TEXT>     We're saving money. And we're having fun. It's all in a day's shopping atOutlet Hell. Remember the credo of the outlet shopper: The more you spend, themore you save. Got it? Good.;   Costume check. Are we dressed correctly, likeall the other shoppers? Are we wearing the clothes we bought on our last tripto Outlet Hell, the same kind of clothes we plan to buy today? Yes, indeed.We're wearing our Ralph Lauren polo shirt with the stamp inside that reads&quot;irregular&quot; that nobody can see but everybody knows is there because theirRalph Lauren polo shirts are stamped &quot;irregular,&quot; too. And we're wearing ourLiz Claiborne skirt in a plaid so ugly only Outlet Hell shoppers would buy it,at great savings, because even though it's hideous, it's a name brand. Allset? Let's go shopping.;   Right now it's back-to-school bargain time atOutlet Hell. Droves of resentful children are passing the last few precioushours of their summer vacations in Outlet Hell arguing with their parents.;  &quot;But Mom, I want the black ones.&quot;;   &quot;Amy, navy blue goes with everything.&quot;;  &quot;Mom, nobody wears navy blue.&quot;;   &quot;They don't have the black ones in yoursize.&quot;;   &quot;But Mom . . . &quot;;   &quot;You want to go to school barefoot? Is that whatyou want?&quot;;   How lucky we are to join the happy throngs at Outlet Hell. Howfortunate we are to breathe the climate-controlled air and listen to Muzakrenditions of Elvis Costello's greatest hits. So let's keep up the pace.Shopping is great aerobic exercise if you do it fast enough. And remember: Themore you spend, the more you save. It makes perfect sense. Doesn't it?;   Herein America we are truly fortunate because everywhere we travel, all across thecountry, there are Outlet Hells. Once upon a time, not so long ago, all we hadwere factory outlets. Now there are outlet malls all over the place, OutletHells with millions of square feet of shopping space filled with bargains.There are hardly any factory outlets anymore because there are hardly anyfactories. The factories are in the Far East. Hong Kong. South Korea. ThePhilippines.;   The new global economy allows us to drive to an outlet inMaine and buy a sweater designed in Great Britain, and made of Australian woolin the Philippines for an American company. This is the new American way. Somepeople miss the factories, and the jobs that went with them, but they'll sooncome to understand that our place in the new world order is to consume, toshop. So let's get out there and do it. We want that yellow sweater. True, wealready have three other yellow sweaters, but none of them are this exactshade of yellow. And besides, it's such a bargain.;   Q: When is a bargain nota bargain?;   A: When you don't need it.;   What was that? All this shoppingmust have made us a little tired, a little testy, because that's not theattitude that brought us to Outlet Hell. What has need got to do withanything? All we have to do is want, and we want that yellow sweater.Remember: The more you spend, the more you save. How much have we saved sofar? Have we saved enough yet to make the trip worthwhile? Have we gotten morethan we bargained for? Can we go home now?  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Diane White column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910829  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  August  </MONTH><PG.COL>  7C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  696  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday, August 29, 199100242098,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
