Oil prices have fallen nine times in the past 10 sessions, slipping below $20 for the first time in almost two months. The decline has been fueled, analysts said, by estimates of above-quota output by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries as well as use of surplus inventory by oil companies, drying up demand.    In the past two weeks, the price of West Texas Intermediate -- the bellwether U.S. crude, traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange -- has tumbled $2.33, or 11%. Earlier, prices were bid up sharply amid intensifying concerns about a disruption in the flow of oil from the Middle East.    &quot;The focus has clearly shifted away from the Persian Gulf to the fundamentals, which look terrible,&quot; said Rick Donovan, head of the international energy department at E.F. Hutton andamp; Co. in New York.    And prices are likely to soften further, oil specialists said.    &quot;Prices will continue to be under pressure as long as there's no dire confrontation in the (Persian) Gulf that leads to a supply disruption,&quot; said Nauman Barakat, energy futures analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. in New York.    Gasoline consumers, however, aren't likely to see much change at the pump unless the weakness in oil prices continues for at least several weeks, oil analysts said.    OPEC, which agreed in June to limit output to 16.6 million barrels a day for the rest of the year, is producing as many as 20 million barrels a day, according to some industry estimates.    &quot;The higher oil prices have increased the payoff to cheating&quot; by members on the cartel's production quotas, said Steve H. Hanke, chief economist at Friedberg Commodity Management Inc. in Toronto.    Weak demand stemming from industry reduction of stocks, or using surplus inventory instead of buying on the market, is exacerbating the weakness in prices, analysts and oil specialists said. Oil companies, which had squirreled away oil as prices rose, are now using their stockpiles instead of buying more oil as market prices fall.    &quot;The inventory adjustment that has accompanied changes in price expectations has been a key factor&quot; in the recent price volatility, Mr. Hanke said.    Crude oil for immediate delivery on the New York Merc slipped 74 cents a barrel to $19.83. The last time crude fell below $20 was June 25, when it stood at $19.64 a barrel. The last time the price fell more in a single day was Sept. 8, 1986, when it dropped 75 cents. Heating oil and gasoline contracts also plunged yesterday.    On the spot, or noncontract, market, the price of West Texas Intermediate fell 70 cents a barrel to $19.85. The spot price of North Sea Brent, the abundantly traded European crude, fell 35 cents a barrel to $18.90 in late trading. </TEXT></DOC>
