In a variety of ways, from increasing alcohol consumptionto declining voter participation, Swedes are rebellingagainst a system many no longer trust. &quot;It has to do with therealization that authorities and politicians don't alwayshave the best interests of the country as their motivation,&quot;said Stockholm University ethnologist Ake Daun.   Swedes have been shaken by several cases of politiciansand business leaders who used their influence to obtain moneyor political advantage. Those scandals have legitimizedselfishness, said Hakan Lindhoff, a lecturer at the Institutefor Journalism, Media and Mass Communication in Stockholm.   Messrs. Lindhoff and Daun cited increasing tax evasion andworker absenteeism. The average Swedish manufacturing workerled industrial Europe by being absent 47 days in 1989,according to a study by the Swedish Manufacturers'Association.                                                                                                          U.S.-SOVIET OIL VENTURE                                                                                                          Anglo-Suisse Inc., a small, closely held U.S.oil-exploration and production company, has agreed withSoviet state oil company Varyeganneftegaz to develop two oilfields in the Tyumen area of Western Siberia, Anglo-SuissePresident Gilles Labbe said. He said the fields are thoughtto hold in excess of 500 million barrels of high-qualitycrude oil and are now in production. He said the work willinclude improving yields from existing wells, returning wellsto production and drilling more, mainly with horizontaldrilling.                                                                                                          NEW DEVELOPMENT FROM NTT                                                                                                          Japan's Nippon Telegraph andamp; Telephone Corp. said it hasdeveloped a new optic-memory material capable ofsuper-high-speed information retrieval and greaterinformation-storage capacity. The new material is said to beroughly 100 million times faster than currently availableoptical-storage materials. An NTT spokesman said the newmaterial could significantly increase the speed with whichinformation can be retrieved from a computer's memory. NTTsaid using the new material, a full page of a newspaper couldbe retrieved in six ten-thousandths of a second.                                                                                                          A SHOPPING CENTER FOR PRAGUE                                                                                                          Three Japanese companies and Czechoslovakia's state-runSlovak Savings Bank will open a shopping center in Prague, aspokesman for one of the Japanese companies, Trans-MediaResources Inc., said. He said the center would be set up inan existing building at a cost of between $3 million and $7million and would be geared toward serving foreign tourists.It also will be used to teach management techniques to localmanagers with the aim of opening other shopping centers forthe local population.                                                                                                          CHINESE IN AUSTRALIA                                                                                                          Australia will grant a range of benefits, including theright to work and free English-language tuition, to the19,400 Chinese who arrived in the country before China'scrackdown on pro-democracy students last year. To obtain thebenefits, the Chinese must withdraw outstanding applicationsfor political asylum and apply for a special humanitarian andrefugee status; the special category, effective Aug. 1, givesthe 19,400 Chinese visas to stay in Australia for four years.
