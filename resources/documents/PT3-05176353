The side edge portions of the      stationary rail are spacedly received in the grooved side wall portions of      the movable rail. Metal rollers are disposed between major flat portions      of the movable and stationary rails. A plastic slider is secured to each      of the guide edge portions and so shaped as to be neatly and slidably      received in the corresponding grooved side wall portion of the movable      rail. The plastic slider has an opening through which an outside edge wall      of the guide edge portion is exposed. A metal ball is rotatably received      in the opening in such a manner that diametrically opposed ends thereof      are contactable with the outside edge wall and an inner surface of the      corresponding grooved side wall. </PAL></ABST><BSUM> <PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  1. Field of the Invention </PAR><PAR>  The present invention relates in general to seat slide devices for use in a      motor vehicle, and more particularly, to seat slide devices of a power      type. More specifically, the present invention is concerned with a power      seat slide device which comprises generally stationary rails secured a      vehicle floor, movable rails slidably engaged with the stationary rails      and carrying thereon a seat, and an electric power unit for driving the      movable rails relative to the stationary rails. </PAR><PAR>  2. Description of the Prior Art </PAR><PAR>  In order to clarify the task of the present invention, one conventional      power seat slide device will be outlined with reference to FIGS. 5 and 6      of the accompanying drawings, which is disclosed in Japanese Patent First      Provisional Publication No. 64-60445. </PAR><PAR>  The power seat slide device of the publication comprises paired (that is,      right and left) rail units 1A and 1B which are illustrated in FIGS. 5 and      6 respectively. </PAR><PAR>  As shown, each rail unit 1A or 1B comprises a stationary rail 3 secured to      a vehicle floor (not shown) and a movable rail 2 slidably engaged with the      stationary rail 3 carrying on a seat (not shown). For achieving the      sliding movement of the movable rail 2 relative to the stationary rail 3,      the movable rail 2 has at its sides respective downward guide walls 2a by      and in which parts 3a of the stationary rail 3 are slidably received. For      smoothing the sliding movement of the movable rail 2, a plastic slider 4      is intimately interposed between each guide wall 2a and the corresponding      part 3a of the stationary rail 3. </PAR><PAR>  However, due to the inherent construction, this conventional power seat      slide device has the following drawbacks. </PAR><PAR>  Since assured and smoothed movement of the movable rails 2 relative to the      stationary rails 3 depends greatly on the dimensional condition of the      plastic sliders 4, production of such plastic sliders 4 requires a highly      skilled molding technique. This increases production cost of the power      seat slide device. In fact, if the plastic sliders 4 have poor dimensional      condition, undesired play of the movable rails 2 tends to occur during the      movement thereof. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a power seat      slide device which is free of the above-mentioned drawbacks. </PAR><PAR>  According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a      seat slide device for use in a vehicle having a floor. The device      comprises a stationary rail secured to the floor and having an elongate      flat upper plate whose side edge portions constitute guide edge portions;      a movable rail including an elongate flat upper part and side wall parts      which extend downward from lateral sides of the elongate flat upper part      to constitute grooved portions which face each other, the movable rail      being engaged with the stationary rail in such a manner that the guide      edge portions of the stationary rail are spacedly received within the      grooved portions of the movable rail respectively; a metal roller disposed      between the elongate flat upper plate of the stationary rail and the      elongate flat upper part of the movable rail; a plastic slider secured to      each of the guide edge portions of the stationary rail, the plastic slider      being so shaped as to be neatly and slidably received in the corresponding      grooved portion of the movable rail and having one opening through which      an outside edge wall of the corresponding guide edge portion of the      stationary wall is exposed; and a metal ball rotatably received in the      opening having its diametrically opposed ends contactable with the outside      edge wall and an inner surface of the corresponding grooved portion. </PAR><PAR>  According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided a      power seat slide device for use in a motor vehicle having a floor.

The      device comprises first and second rail units which are arranged on the      floor to extend in parallel with each other, each rail unit including a      stationary rail secured to the floor and having an elongate flat upper      plate whose side edge portions constitute guide edge portions; a movable      rail including an elongate flat upper part and side wall parts which      extend downward from lateral sides of the elongate flat upper part to      constitute grooved portions which face each other, the movable rail being      engaged with the stationary rail in such a manner that the guide edge      portions of the stationary rail are spacedly received within the grooved      portions of the movable rail respectively; a metal roller disposed between      the elongate flat upper plate of the stationary rail and the elongate flat      upper part of the movable rail; a plastic slider secured to each of the      guide edge portions of the stationary rail, the plastic slider being so      shaped as to be neatly and slidably received in the corresponding grooved      portion of the movable rail and having one opening through which an      outside edge wall of the corresponding guide edge portion of the      stationary wall is exposed; and a metal ball rotatably received in the      opening having its diametrically opposed ends contactable with the outside      edge wall and an inner surface of the corresponding grooved portion; and      an electric drive means for driving both of the first and second rail      units in a manner to move the movable rail relative to the stationary rail      by means of an electric power. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent      from the following description when taken in conjunction with the      accompanying drawings, in which: </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a perspective view of a power seat slide device according to the      present invention, the device being illustrated with its front part      directed leftward; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is a sectional view taken along the line II--II of FIG. 1; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is a sectional view taken along the line III--III of FIG. 1, showing      a movable rail, a stationary rail, rollers, boll bearings and plastic      sliders; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 is a view similar to FIG. 4, but showing a modification of the power      seat slide device of the present invention; and </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 5 and 6 are sectional views of paired (that is, right and left) rail      units which are employed in a conventional power seat slide device. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  Referring to FIGS. 1 to 3, particularly FIG. 1, there is shown a power seat      slide device 10 according to the present invention. </PAR><PAR>  The device 10 comprises a pair (that is, right and left) rail units 20A and      20B which are spaced by a distance corresponding to the width of a seat      (not shown) which is to be mounted on the device 10. Designated by numeral      25 is an electric power unit which is arranged between the paired rail      units 20A and 20B. Flexible cables &quot;F&quot; extend from the power unit 25 to      the respective rail units 20. </PAR><PAR>  The paired rail units 20A and 20B have substantially the same constructions      but they have a bisymmetrical relationship therebetween. Thus, in the      following, the detailed description on the rail units 20A and 20B will be      directed to only the left rail unit 20B for facilitation of the      description. </PAR><PAR>  The rail unit 20B (or 20A) comprises a stationary rail 40 which is secured      to a vehicle floor (not shown) and a movable rail 30 which is slidably      engaged with the stationary rail 40 and carries thereon a seat (not      shown). </PAR><PAR>  As will be seen from FIG. 1, the electric drive unit 25 comprises an      electric reversible motor 26 and a speed reduction gear unit 27. The      electric motor 26 is mounted to an end of a housing of the gear unit 27.      An output shaft 26a of the electric motor 26 is projected into the housing      and rotatably held by the same. </PAR><PAR>  The speed reduction gear unit 27 comprises a set of gears (not shown) the      lead one of which is engaged with the output shaft 26a of the electric      motor 26 and the tail one of which is connected with both the flexible      cables &quot;F&quot;. For connecting the flexible cables &quot;F&quot; to the tail gear of the      speed reduction gear unit 27, couplers 28 are detachably connected to the      housing of the gear unit 27. </PAR><PAR>  Designated by numeral 29 is an annular knob which is fixed to a rotation      shaft of an intermediate gear of the gear unit 27. Thus, by manipulating      the knob 29, the gears of the gear unit 27 can be rotated. </PAR><PAR>  As will be seen from FIG. 2 which shows a sectional view taken along the      line II--II of FIG. 1, the movable rail 30 is constructed to have a      generally C-shaped cross section and arranged to direct its channel      downward. </PAR><PAR>  That is, the movable rail 30 comprises an elongate flat upper part 31 (see      FIG. 1) and side wall parts 32 extending downward from respective side      edges of the upper part 31. Designated by numeral 32a in FIG. 3 is a      groove which is defined by each of the side wall parts 32. </PAR><PAR>  As is best seen in FIG. 1, mounted on the movable rail 30 is a drive unit      35 to which the flexible cable &quot;F&quot; is led. </PAR><PAR>  As is seen from FIG. 2, the drive unit 35 comprises a worm 36 directly      driven by the flexible cable &quot;F&quot;, a worm wheel 37 driven by the worm 36, a      pinion 38 driven by the worm wheel 37 and a housing (no numeral). The worm      wheel 37 comprises a metal base part and a plastic gear part which are      coaxially arranged and secured to each other by bolts (no numerals). The      pinion 38 is coaxially connected to the worm wheel 37. </PAR><PAR>  As is best shown in FIG. 3, the stationary rail 40 comprises generally an      elongate base plate 45 having a depressed .OMEGA.-shaped cross section and      an elongate flat upper plate 41 welded to tops of side wall parts of the      base plate 45. </PAR><PAR>  As is seen from FIG. 2, the elongate base plate 45 has a flat bottom      surface 47 which extends longitudinally in parallel with the flat upper      part 31 of the movable rail 30. </PAR><PAR>  The elongate flat upper plate 41 of the stationary rail 40 has side edges      which constitute guide edge portions 42 for guiding the fore-and-aft      movement of the movable rail 30 relative to the stationary rail 40. That      is, the guide edge portions 42 are spacedly put in the respective grooves      32a defined by the side wall parts 32 of the movable rail 30. </PAR><PAR>  As is seen from FIG. 1, the elongate flat upper plate 41 of the stationary      rail 40 has a longitudinally extending slot 43. An inboard side edge of      the slot 43 is formed with teeth which constitute a rack 44 to which the      afore-mentioned pinion 38 (see FIG. 2) of the drive unit 35 is operatively      engaged. </PAR><PAR>  As is seen from FIG. 3, an elongate contacting plate 39 is fixed to an      inner surface of the flat upper part 31 of the movable rail 30 in a manner      to extend along the same. An inward side 39a of the contacting plate 39 is      bent downward toward the rack 44 of the stationary rail 40 for the purpose      which will be clarified hereinafter. </PAR><PAR>  As is seen from FIGS. 1 and 3, front and rear metal rollers 51 are disposed      between the stationary and movable rails 40 and 30, more specifically,      between the flat bottom surface 47 of the stationary rail 40 and      contacting plate 39 of the movable rail 30. Thus, downward load applied to      the movable rail 30 is transmitted to the stationary rail 40 through these      rollers 51. </PAR><PAR>  It is to be noted that due to provision of the downwardly bent edge 39a of      the afore-mentioned contacting plate 39, the rollers 51 are prevented from      contacting the rack 44. </PAR><PAR>  As is seen from FIG. 1, each roller 51 has an upper part projected upward      through the elongate slot 43 of the stationary rail 40. </PAR><PAR>  As is understood from FIGS. 1 and 3, the guide edge portions 42 of the      stationary rail 40 each an an elongate plastic slider 53 tightly connected      thereto. Although not shown in the drawings, for achieving the tight      connection of the plastic slider 53 with the stationary rail 40, each      plastic slider 53 has several projections latchingly fitted in notches      formed in the corresponding guide edge portion 42. </PAR><PAR>  If desired, each plastic slider 53 may be divided into two parts, one being      for a front-half of the corresponding guide edge portion 42 and the other      being for a rear-half of the guide edge portion. With this divided      construction, an undesired crack of the plastic slider 53, which may be      caused by the differential thermal expansion between hot and cold seasons,      is prevented. </PAR><PAR>  As is seen from FIG. 3, the plastic slider 53 is so shaped as to be neatly      and slidably received in the groove 32a of the corresponding side wall      part 32 of the movable rail 30. Furthermore, the plastic slider 53 has a      longitudinally extending channel in which the corresponding guide edge      portion 42 is snugly received. </PAR><PAR>  Each plastic slider 53 has at least two openings 53a at front and rear      portions thereof, through which an outside wall of the corresponding guide      edge portion 42 can be exposed. A metal ball 52 is rotatably received in      each opening 53a with an outside portion slightly projected therefrom.      Thus, upon assembly, each metal ball 52 is located between the inner      surface of the groove 32a of the movable rail 30 and the outside wall of      the guide edge portion 42 of the stationary rail 40. Accordingly, lateral      load applied to the movable rail 30 is transmitted to the stationary rail      40 through the metal balls 52. </PAR><PAR>  A suitable amount of grease is applied to the rail unit, particularly at      portions where friction of parts tend to occur. </PAR><PAR>  In the following, operation will be described. For ease of understanding,      the description will be commenced with respect to a condition wherein the      motor 26 is at rest. </PAR><PAR>  Under this rest condition, the movable rail 30, on which the seat is      mounted, keeps one selected position relative to the stationary rail 40.      It is to be noted that due to the nature of the speed reduction gear unit      27 at rest, the position of the movable rail 30 is substantially fixed. </PAR><PAR>  When the motor 26 is energized to run in one or the other direction, the      power of the motor 26 is transmitted through the speed reduction gear unit      27 and the flexible cable &quot;F&quot; to the drive unit 35 to rotate the pinion 38      which is meshed with the rack 43 of the stationary rail 40. With the      rotation of the pinion 38, the movable rail 30 slides forwardly or      rearwardly on and along the stationary rail 40. Upon deenergization of the      motor 26, the movable rail 30 stops and thus keeps its new position. </PAR><PAR>  During the sliding movement of the movable rail 30, the rollers 51 roll to      run along the flat bottom surface 47 of the stationary rail 40 forward or      rearward, while the balls 52 roll to stay within the openings 53a of the      plastic sliders 53. Furthermore, during this movement, the downward load      and lateral load applied thereto are transmitted to the stationary rail 40      through the metal rollers 51 and metal balls 52, respectively. </PAR><PAR>  Due to provision of the plastic sliders 53 between the stationary and      movable rails 40 and 30, the sliding movement of the movable rail 30 is      smoothly carried out with a minimum degree of play. Furthermore, even if      the metal parts of the rail unit 20B (or 20A) are manufactured with some      dimensional errors, the plastic sliders 53 can absorb such errors. </PAR><PAR>  When, due to failure of the electric power unit 25, the motor 26 is not      operated even when a control switch (not shown) is turned ON, the      following manipulation can be taken for moving the seat (more      specifically, the movable rail 30) to a convenient position. </PAR><PAR>  That, is the annular knob 29 is manipulated to turn in one or the other      direction. With this, the pinion 38 of the drive unit 35 is rotated and      thus, the movable rail 30 is moved, albeit slowly, to a convenient      position. </PAR><PAR>  Referring to FIG. 4, there is shown a modification of the power seat slide      device of the present invention. </PAR><PAR>  In this modification, the movable and stationary rails 30a and 40a have      cross sections which are different from those of the above-mentioned first      embodiment. However, similar to the first embodiment, the movable rail 30a      comprises comprises an elongate flat upper part 31a and side wall parts      32a extending downward from respective side edges of the upper part 31a.      The side wall parts 32a have grooves defined thereby. Furthermore, the      stationary rail 40a comprises generally an elongate base plate 45a and an      elongate flat upper plate 41a secured to the base plate 45 with an      interposal of two reinforcing plates (no numerals) therebetween. </PAR><PAR>  The elongate base plate 45a has a flat bottom surface 47a which extends      longitudinally in parallel with the flat upper part 31a of the movable      rail 30. </PAR><PAR>  The elongate flat upper plate 41a of the stationary rail 40a has side edges      which constitute guide edge portions 42a which are spacedly put in the      respective grooves defined by the side wall parts 32a of the movable rail      30a. </PAR><PAR>  Metal rollers 51 and metal balls 52 are arranged in substantially the same      manner as in the case of the first embodiment. </PAR><PAR>  In the following, advantages of the present invention will be described. </PAR><PAR>  First, because of provision of the metal balls 52, the lateral load is      assuredly received by the stationary rail 40 or 40a. The downward load is      transmitted to the stationary rail through the metal rollers 51. </PAR><PAR>  Second, since the sliding movement of the movable rail 30 or 30a relative      to the stationary rail 40 or 40a is promoted by three sliding means which      are the rollers 51, the balls 52 and the plastic sliders 53, the movement      is smoothly achieved.
