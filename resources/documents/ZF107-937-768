(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>PCs force mainframes into new roleandM;A report from Market Intelligence Research Co. in Mountain View, Calif.andO;projects worldwide sales of mainframe computers to approach $70 billion by1994.andM;La Jolla, Calif.'s Computer Intelligence recently found that, aftermaintaining a growth rate of one per cent per year from 1984 to 1987, theU.S.andP;  population of IBM mainframes (based on CI estimates) has increased 10to 11 per cent over each of the last two years.andM;And during a visit to Japan last month, George Keller, executivevice-president of AFSM International, told a group of Japanese high-techservice executives, &quot;The computer market may be in a state of flux, butmainframes will remain a significant factor in this market.&quot;andM;Yet, Steven Gold, manager of systems development for auto parts manufacturerEchlin Inc. in Branford, Conn., argues that mainframes have outlived theirusefulness and can now be effectively replaced by networked microcomputers.andM;&quot;What's occurred is really a technological change,&quot; Gold said at a seminarsponsored by Peat Marwick Stevenson andamp; Kellogg in Toronto last month.andP;  &quot;The3090 mainframes -- the 370 architecture -- is now technologically obsolete...andP;  those are simply the facts.&quot;andM;End-user worryandM;In 1985, Gold embarked on an ambitious plan to replace his shop's IBM 4341mainframe with networked PCs.andP;  Last year Echlin headquarters sold itsmainframe and currently reports $800,000 (U.S.) in annual MIS (managementinformation systems) savings.andP;  Corporate systems at Echlin, including HumanResources, General Ledger, Fixed Assets and Consolidation, are now supportedby 60 networked PCs using four file servers.andM;&quot;When we first proposed the idea there were a lot of people who couldn'tbelieve it could be done,&quot; said Gold.andP;  &quot;At the time it was radical -- therewas worry among end-users.&quot;andM;To try and minimize the change in procedure for end-users, it was necessaryto give them identical functionality to what they were used to on themainframe, he said.andM;In effect, all the mainframe applications were moved over to themicrocomputer environment one-by-one, and according to Gold, they &quot;are atleast as fast and usually faster&quot; than on the mainframe.andM;Several in the audience took issue with Gold's comment that mainframes areobsolete.andP;  Pat Bewers, president of the Canadian Information ProcessingSociety and vice-president of systems development services at CentralGuaranty Trust in Halifax, said she thinks of her mainframe as just &quot;anothernode&quot; in her network of microcomputers, and doesn't think the need formainframe processing power is likely to go away.andM;Several hardware vendors appear to agree with Bewers.andP;  Just this month therewere four mainframe announcements: Digital Equipment Corp. introduced its Vax9000 series; Tandem Computers Inc. announced the NonStop Cyclone system;Control Data Corp. introduced a new high-end Cyber mainframe; and, IBMannounced 16 new models in its Enterprise Systems/3090 family.andM;In its report, MIRC identified the following reasons for recent growth in themainframe market:andM;* gradual recovery from the recent worldwide slackening of mainframe computersales;andM;* a growing use of small mainframes as department level computer processorsfor driving end-user applications such as database management systems;andM;* a trend by manufacturers to use mainframes in order to penetrate verticalmarkets;andM;* constantly evolving changes in the underlying technology; and,andM;* the growth and maturation of several mainframe product categories, forexample supercomputers.andM;&quot;New generations of mainframe computer and peripheral equipment hardwarecontinue to be introduced with succeeding generations continuing to providegreater power and greater speed for less cost at a smoothly progressiverate,&quot; states the MIRC report.andM;&quot;...  Despite industry expectations that mainframes would be supplanted byminicomputers, superminicomputers and even microcomputers, mainframescontinue to constitute a strong marketplace.&quot;andM;In his Japan address, Keller also argued that business articles suggesting&quot;that mainframes are dinosaurs and a thing of the past&quot; have missed the mark.andM;Predicting that future technology breakthroughs in mainframes will result incontinued market growth, he noted that several stock market analysts havesuggested there is room for 20 to 30 per cent growth.andM;Reduced costsandM;Despite this projected increase, however, Gold is content with his decisionto go with microcomputers.andP;  He stated that his hardware costs are decreasing(Echlin's current corporate data processing budget is at the $600,000 markwhereas the projected mainframe budget for 1989 was $1.6 million); thequality of the software produced is better; and, he is in a position to takeadvantage of new technology developments like fibre optics.andM;&quot;All the technology trends are in the direction of this decision,&quot; said Gold.andO;&quot;It's getting cheaper and cheaper to run things on the microcomputer.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
