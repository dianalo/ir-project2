We used a Picker International MR imagerwith a 0.5-tesla superconducting magnet. The pulse sequences involvedthe inversion recovery technique (TR, 2,100 msec ; TI, 600 msec ; TE,40 msec) for the T/sub 1/-weighted images and spin echo technique (TR,1,800 msec ; TE, 120 msec) for the T/sub 2/-weighted images. The TC scannerwas a Somatom 2 or DR3. In the patients with type II A and type VI MPS,there were multi-focal lesions of various sizes that showed prolongedT/sub 1/ and T/sub 2/ in the white matter. These lesions, which werenot detected by CT, seemed to be correlated with the pathological findingsof cavitation and dilated periadventitial space with viscous fluid. Inthe patients with type II A and type III B MPS, the T/sub 2/-weightedimages showed a reduced contrast between gray and white matters, whichmay be related to the deposition of glycolipids and mucopolysaccharidesin the lysosomes of the neurons and astrocytes of the gray and whitematters. These findings seemed to be correlated with the clinical findingof mental retardation. In the patient of type II A MPS, there were lesionsthat showed prolonged T/sub 2/ of the periventricular white matter, suggestingperiventricular edema. But CT hardly detected these lesions. In the patientswith type I S MPS, no abnormal findings were found in MR imaging. Itwas concluded that MR imaging was far more sensitive for the detectionof MPS lesions than CT, and was a useful method for differential diagnosisin MPS.</TEXT></DOC>
