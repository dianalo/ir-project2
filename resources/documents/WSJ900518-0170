Edward G. Boehne, president of the Philadelphia FederalReserve Bank, said yesterday that the Fed hasn't changedmonetary policy since right before Christmas. Other Fedofficials wouldn't comment directly, but didn't challenge Mr.Boehne's comments.</LP><TEXT>   A few weeks ago, signs of rapid inflation were leadingsome Fed officials to talk as if they might be ready totighten policy, and nudge up interest rates. But governmentstatistics released over the past week suggested the economywas weaker and inflation less threatening than previouslythought.   As a result, Fed officials now seem to think their bestpolicy may be to stay put. &quot;The risk to the economy is fairlyeven between a further slowdown and inflation,&quot; Mr. Boehnetold the Philadelphia Association of Retired Bankers.   Mr. Boehne is currently a voting member of the Fed's keypolicy committee, which is made up of five district reservebank presidents plus the members of the Fed's board ofgovernors.   Some market analysts have in recent days begun tospeculate that the Fed may soon ease credit to help boost theeconomy. But for his part, Mr. Boehne seems pleased withcurrent slow-growth rates. He said the economy has achievedthe hoped-for soft landing, and is now growing &quot;at a moderatepace that is sustainable.&quot;   &quot;I am reasonably optimistic about the whole economy as wego forward,&quot; he said.   The Fed eased monetary policy several times late lastyear, with the most recent move occurring shortly beforeChristmas. At the time, Mr. Boehne said, there wasconsiderable concern about recession. But despite the recentweak economic numbers, he said, fears of recession havereceded.   Earlier this year, the Fed was under heavy pressure fromthe Treasury to bring down interest rates. Treasury officialsthought high U.S. rates were partly responsible forattracting foreign investors and thus driving up the value ofthe dollar relative to the Japanese yen. In the last fewweeks, however, the dollar's value has fallen significantlyagainst the yen, easing the Treasury's concerns.   Mr. Boehne said that when the Fed does decide to moveagain, it will continue to be in the small steps that havecharacterized the central bank's action under thechairmanship of Alan Greenspan. &quot;Federal Reserve policy isone of prudence,&quot; he said, &quot;steady as she goes.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
