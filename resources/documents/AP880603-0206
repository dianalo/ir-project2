Gorbachev is ``aserious man seeking serious reform,'' but that the Soviet Unionstill should be viewed with caution.   ``Let us embrace honest change when it occurs; but let us alsobe wary. Let us stay strong,'' Reagan said in the address.   The president also said the West must continue to speak outabout human rights conditions in the Soviet Union. ``In matter ofstate, unless the truth be spoken, it ceases to exist,'' he said.   Winding up a 10-day journey that included five days in theSoviet capital, Reagan gave his summit assessment in a speechbefore the Royal Institute of International Affairs at Guildhall, acenter of civic government for more than 1,000 years.   The speech was a rhetorical highlight of the trip, offeringencouragement for Gorbachev's campaigns of ``Perestroika'' and``glasnost,'' reforms, while expressing cautious hope for ``a newera in history.''   At the Guildhall, Reagan passed along a corridor lined with theLord Mayor Sir Greville Spratt's personal guard of pikemen andmusketeers. He was preceded by ceremonial sword and mace bearersinto the wood-paneled Great Hall where he delivered the speech.   After a farewell to U.S. Embassy families here, Reagan and hiswife Nancy flew from London aboard Air Force One to Washington andreceived a warm welcoming ceremony at Andrews Air Force Base, Md.   The White House distributed 4,000 tickets for the ceremony tomembers of the Republican National Committee, congressionalfamilies, White House staff members and their families andpolitical appointees.   The Air Force Ceremonial Band played martial music for an hourbefore the arrival and the spectators displayed signs reading,``Another One for the Gipper,'' ``There You Go Again'' and``Welcome Home.''   Reagan's four days of talks with Gorbachev did not produce anybreakthrough on a strategic arms reduction treaty, though bothsides said some key differences had been narrowed. Nevertheless,the two leaders displayed a warm personal relationship.   Reagan said the Soviet Union is dominated now by talk ofdemocratic reform, in the economy, in political institutions, andin religious, social and artistic life _ ``in short, givingindividuals more freedom to run their own affairs, to control theirown destinies.   ``To those of us familiar with the post-war era, all of this iscause for shaking head in wonder,'' Reagan said, expressingamazement about an American president and a Soviet leader walkingtogether in Red Square, as he and Gorbachev did, talking about ``agrowing personal friendship and meeting.''   He said that episode was ``a special moment in a week of specialmoments.''   ``My personal impression of Mr. Gorbachev is that he is aserious man seeking serious reform,'' Reagan said. ``I pray thatthe hand of the Lord will be on the Soviet people.''   He said the strategy of the West for dealing with the Sovietswas ``bearing fruit.   `Quite possibly, we are beginning to take down the barriers ofthe post-war era, quite possibly we are entering a new era inhistory, a time of lasting change in the Soviet Union,'' he said.   ``We will have to see,'' the president said. ``But if so, it isbecause of the steadfastness of the allies _ the democracies _ formore than 40 years, and especially in this decade.''   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, speaking after Reagan, said,``We warmly congratulate you and General Secretary Gorbachev on avery successful summit, one which will influence the course ofhistory for years to come.''   She also thanked Reagan for pushing the human rights issue,saying, ``your words in Moscow will have shone like a beacon ofhope for all those wherever they are who are denied their basicfreedoms.''   Reagan suggested he would continue to speak out against humanrights abuses in the Soviet Union and elsewhere.   ``We have learned the first objective of the adversaries offreedom is to make free nations question their own faith infreedom, to make us think that adhering to our principles andspeaking out against human rights abuses or foreign aggression issomehow an act of belligerence ...   ``In matters of state,'' he said, ``unless the truth be spoken,it ceases to exist.''   Despite the impasse on a START treaty, Reagan spokeoptimistically about chances for getting an agreement.   ``We made tangible progress toward the START treaty on strategicweapons,'' the president said. ``Such a treaty, with all itsimplications, is, I believe, now within our grasp.''   However, he said, there are other elements as important as armsnegotations.   ``As I never tire of saying, nations do not distrust each otherbecause they are armed; they are armed because they distrust eachother,'' Reagan said. ``So equally important items on the agenda(in Moscow) dealt with critical issues, like regional conflicts,human rights and bilateral exchanges.''   Despite some progress, American negotiators say the two sidesmade no progress on some of the thorniest areas of dispute:sea-launched cruise missiles and the longstanding difference overReagan's Star Wars missile defense system.   In his speech, Reagan paid a special Mrs. Thatcher, his closefriend and ally, noting that she had been among the first tosuggest the West could ``do business'' with Gorbachev.   ``At this hour in history, prime minister, the entire worldsalutes you and your gallant people and gallant nation.''   Underscoring the theme of human rights he trumpeted in theSoviet Union, Reagan said, ``the best indicator of how much we careabout freedom is what we say about freedom; it is in this sense,words truly are actions.''   After the speech, Reagan retuned to the ambassador's residencefor a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita.   As a half-dozen members of the Japanese parliament looked on,reporters questioned Reagan during a picture-taking session on theback terrace of the Winfield House.   Asked if he were going to discuss trade with Takeshita, Reagansaid ``could be.''   Asked whether he and Gorbachev had discussed the Seoul olympics,he said ``that did not come up.''   After about three minutes, Reagan told reporters, ``We have togo to work. Why don't you take the rest of the day off.''   Someone asked Reagan to comment on whether Gorbachev felt thathe had abused Soviet hospitality by speaking out on human rights inMoscow.   ``He didn't give me any indication that he felt that way and wedo think it is an important topic between us.''   Asked if Gorbachev does not, in fact, set the tone for humanrights in the Soviet Union, Reagan said, ``it's that entire system,you can't put the blame on one individual.''   Asked if Gorbachev intended to press forward with opening up theSoviet Union further he said ``he very definitely intends to goforward and it's a definite improvement. We parted in a veryfriendly manner.''   On Thursday, Queen Elizabeth II entertained him with tea atBuckingham Palace, a band played tunes written by 100-year-oldAmerican songmaster Irving Berlin and Mrs. Thatcher salutedReagan's ``tremendous success'' at his summit which, she said,heralds ``a new era in East-West relations.''</TEXT></DOC>
