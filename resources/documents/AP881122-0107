(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The White House is signalingdispleasure with a congressional ethics bill, although officialswill not say whether President Reagan will veto the legislation.   The deadline for a presidential decision on the bill is Friday,and White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater has told reporters thatadministration officials are voicing some very adverse reaction toit.

Reagan earlier this month vetoed a whistleblower bill, at theurging of Attorney General Richard Thornburgh, who complained thatthe legislation caused separation-of-powers problems between thelegislative and executive branches and would have made it virtuallyimpossible for the government to fire anyone.
