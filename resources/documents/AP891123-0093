The championship, which opens Friday in the northern port cityof Haifa, features teams from 26 countries, including East blocnations that have no diplomatic ties with Israel: Bulgaria, Poland,Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union.   The 46-member Soviet delegation includes some of the strongestplayers of the past and present, among them grandmaster and formerworld champion Mikhail Tal and women's world champion MayaZhiburdnidze.   ``I'm happy to visit the country where I played 25 years ago,''said grandmaster and former world champion Vassily Smyslov.   One of the Soviet Union's best-known players and former worldchampion Anatoly Karpov also arrived Thursday on a flight fromMadrid, Spain. Karpov will spend three days in Israel as a guest ofhonor, but will not participate in the championship.   World champion Gary Kasparov is playing in an individualtournament in Belgrade, Yugoslavia.   The Soviet guests brought about 20 boxes of chess supplies fortheir Israeli colleagues. In exchange, the Israel Chess Federationis covering hotel costs, officials said.   At Ben-Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv, media attention was focusedon Aeroflot Flight 5515, the first such journey from Moscow to TelAviv.   ``I have flown to Cyprus, Yemen and Syria, but this is the firstflight to Israel, of course,'' said Capt. Oleg Agafonov. He was tofly to Greece later Thursday because ``diplomatic problems''prevented him from spending the night in Tel Aviv.   The Soviet plane is scheduled to fly back to Israel Dec. 4 totake the Soviet delegation home.   The flight follows a tentative agreement between Aeroflot andIsrael's El Al Airlines on direct flights between Israel and theSoviet Union, expected to start in January.   Sports ties between Israel and most East bloc countries werelargely reduced when those countries cut diplomatic relationsfollowing the 1967 Middle East War.   The climate has warmed since Israel and the Soviets exchangeddiplomatic missions in 1987 and 1988. At present, Israel maintainsfull relations with Romania and Hungary and low-level ties withPoland.</TEXT></DOC>
