The statement by Paul Wolfowitz, the undersecretary of defensefor policy, was hailed Wednesday as a step forward by congressionalleaders who have criticized the president for failing to make astronger case for his two-missile plan.   ``Our land-based missile deterrent program is now being designedwith the president's proposal to basically have a deterrence againstboth a `bolt-out-of-the-blue' attack as well as a first strike,''said Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed ServicesCommittee.   In arguing for the two-missile plan, Wolfowitz said survivabilityis a consideration in all parts of the so-called nuclear triad: thecombination of land-, air- and sea-based nuclear weapons.   ``If some of our ICBMs were survivable, this would provide, amongother things, a hedge should vulnerabilities emerge in the bomber orsubmarine legs, and in conjunction with the alert bombers and at-seaSSBNs, the strongest possible deterrent against Soviet pre-emptivestrike,'' Wolfowitz told the Senate panel.   He acknowledged deterrence has been the center of the debate overmodernization of land-based missiles for almost two decades. Theadministration concluded after a recent review that some of eachportion of the triad must be survivable as part of that deterrent.   The nation's bombers and submarines meet that goal and theemphasis is now on land-based missiles, he said.   The Bush administration is looking to protect land-based missilesin silos against a Soviet strike during a crisis or even aconventional war and from a sudden attack in the absence of anyhostilities. Other missiles would be mobile.   Wolfowitz also told the panel verification and funds for the twomissiles are necessary before the United States can reach a treatyagreement with the Soviet Union to limit mobile missiles.   Bush told congressional leaders Tuesday he was willing to abandonthe mobile-missile ban at the negotiating table in Geneva if itwould strengthen his chance of winning congressional approval forhis two-missile plan.   Bush in April proposed spending $1.2 billion in fiscal 1990 onmoving the existing multiple-warhead MX missiles from silos torailroad cars and another $100 million on the single-warheadMidgetman.   Bush's decision Tuesday received a favorable response frommembers of Congress, as did his decision to increase funds for theMidgetman by about $1 billion.   While Bush has tempered the opposition to the two-missile plan,complaints about the B-2 stealth program are growing in Congress. Atabout $500 million a copy, the radar-evading is the most expensivein history.   Nunn raised the issue with Gen. Larry Welch, Air Force chief ofstaff, saying the problems with the earlier B-1, budget constraintsand concerns about ``not flying before we buy'' have contributed tothe opposition.   Welch argued that if the Pentagon attempted flight tests of threeor four planes while shutting down production, the cost of theaircraft would increase significantly.   ``Delaying production would cost $3 billion for one year,'' Welchsaid.   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has already proposed pushing backproduction of the stealth bomber a year to 1993 and cutting almost$4.1 billion from fiscal 1990 and 1991 budgets for the plane.</TEXT></DOC>
