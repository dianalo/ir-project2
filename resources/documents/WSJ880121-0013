A spokesman said the thrift believes the new name &quot;reflects the nature of the banking services we provide and our strategy of positioning ourselves as a bank, rather than a traditional thrift.&quot; But &quot;officially, we'll still be a thrift,&quot; he conceded.    AmeriFirst had no estimate of the cost of the name change, which the Federal Home Loan Bank Board must approve. The thrift expects the name change to be effective in March.    AmeriFirst has about $4 billion of assets. In over-the-counter trading yesterday, it closed at $14.375, down 37.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
