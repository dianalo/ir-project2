The measure would prohibit mergers of state-charteredinstitutions that have more than 30% of Arizona's commercialbank deposits, said the bill's Democratic sponsor, ManuelPena. By Mr. Pena's calculation, BankAmerica would have ahuge 72% of such assets, or about $12 billion, after themerger. Assets of federally chartered commercial banks aren'tincluded in his figures, he said.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;I'm opposed to the merger,&quot; Mr. Pena said. &quot;Smallcommercial businesses are not able to secure loans at areasonable rate right now. If we have another merger and onebigger bank, money will be even less available for smallerenterprises and rural counties.&quot; Mr. Pena, who is chairman ofthe state senate's commerce and labor committee, said thecommittee is likely to pass the bill tomorrow.   A BankAmerica spokesman said the bill is &quot;unnecessary. Itaddresses antitrust issues we have been working on for monthswith federal and state authorities.&quot;   Meanwhile, the proposed deal faces other opposition. Amidintensive lobbying on the Washington state bill, BankAmericalast week said it would consider selling Security Pacific'slarge bank unit in the state if that measure becomes law. Thebill hasn't yet made it to the floor of the state's House ofRepresentatives.</TEXT></DOC>
