Gorbachev expressing hopes for ``a calm andpeaceful period of change'' in Eastern Europe as democratic reformsare adopted, the White House said today.   The message echoed the theme of a cable that Gorbachev sent toBush last Friday.   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater told reporters thepresident ``indicated his support for the changes in Eastern Europeand the reforms under way in the Soviet Union.''   ``He said the United States wants a calm and peaceful period ofchange in Eastern Europe as Poland, Hungary and East Germany seekto implement their reforms,'' the spokesman said.   ``The president said he believes these historic steps will makea positive contribution to a Europe that is whole and free,''Fitzwater said.   The message was dispatched to Moscow on Thursday evening andwill be delivered by U.S. Ambassador Jack Matlock.   The cable was written after a week of consultation between theUnited States and Western allies.   A week ago, Fitzwater had said that Gorbachev's message to Bush``underscored the importance of the changes taking place andexpressed the hope that the situation will remain calm andpeaceful.''   Bush and Gorbachev will meet Dec 2 and 3 on ships off the coastof Malta for their first summit.   Fitzwater said the dominant issue will be the changes in EasternEurope and their impact on the North Atlantic Treaty Organizationand the Warsaw Pact and East-West relations in general.   Bush talked by telephone today with President FrancoisMitterrand of France, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada andChancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany about events in EasternEurope and the summit.   Fitzwater said Bush and Mitterrand agreed to talk again after ameeting of European leaders this weekend and before Bush sits downwith Gorbachev. Bush and Mulroney also said they would talk afterMalta.   In preparation for the talks, Bush planned to confer at theWhite House today with four former U.S. ambassadors to the SovietUnion: George Kennan, Malcolm Toon, Thomas Watson and ArthurHartman.   On Saturday, the president will hold two meetings withthink-tank experts and other Soviet specialists concerning domesticpolitics in the Soviet Union and East-West relations in general.   Fitzwater said the structure of the summit calls for generaldiscussions ``rather than specific of pinpoint kinds of proposals.''   He said the United States was not concerned that Gorbachev mightspring a surprise on Bush, as he did with then-President Reaganwhen he proposed sweeping arms cuts during the Reykjavik summit.   Fitzwater said, ``Obviously, if President Gorbachev makes aproposal, the president will say, `Well, that's very interesting,why do you feel that way and what's your reasoning?'' and he'llgive him his points of view and his ideas and say, `We'll takethese matters up with the allies and we'll talk about them again atour next summit.'''   Fitzwater added, ``We don't anticipate any negotiating going onthere or the emergence of any specific agreements in any kind offormal fashion.''</TEXT></DOC>
