Air France Flight 914, bound for Amsterdam with 81 passengers,took off Thursday from Charles De Gaulle Airport about 4 p.m. and afew minutes later, warning lights indicated failure of the plane'scomputers, the spokesman said.   The A320 is equipped with a ``fly-by-wire'' system that controlsthe plane's engines through computers rather than cables.   A second set of lights indicating a fire in the toilet alsoilluminated without apparent cause, the spokesman said, speaking oncondition of anonymity in keeping with company policy.   As the plane prepared to land, more lights flashed, warning thatthe landing gear failed. The pilot made a pass over the airport andAir France technicians visually confirmed that the landing gear wasin place. The plane landed without further incident, the spokesmansaid.   The passengers went on to Amsterdam aboard other flights.   The plane, the ``Ville de Paris,'' was the first of thesophisticated A320s to be delivered to Air France after the planewas certified for flight on Feb. 26.   The same plane was delayed because of mechanical problems on itsinaugural flight over Paris in April with then-Premier JacquesChirac on board. The half-hour delay led to discussions in theFrench press about the wisdom of letting the premier fly on the newaircraft.   In June, three passengers were killed when an A320 crashedduring a low-altitude demonstration flight before thousands ofpeople at an air show in eastern France. An investigation is underway into the cause of the accident.   Developed over four years at a cost of nearly $2 billion, theA320 has been touted by the European consortium Airbus Industrie asthe fastest-selling plane in aircraft history.   Airbus has received more than 500 orders or letters of intent topurchase the plane from 21 countries, including the United States,Canada and Britain.</TEXT></DOC>
