<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-09-0190 </DOCNO><TEXT>Acid deposition, as measured by the concentration of SO/sub 4//sup =/and NO/sub 3//sup -/ ions in precipitation, is a consequence of the photochemicaltransformation in the atmosphere of precursor species (SO/sub 2/ andNO) emitted principally from facilities that burn fossil fuel. Mathematicalmodels describing this process quantitatively can be used to evaluatethe consequence of emission control programs designed to alleviate acidrain effects. This paper describes such models in general and one modelin particular (MIT model), emphasizing the difficulty and expense ofexercising the complex models and the practical significance of usingsimplified models validated against measurements. It illustrates theuse of the MIT model in determining the source apportionment of depositionat chosen receptors, the evaluation of the depositional consequencesof national programs for precursor emission reduction, the delineationof historic trends in precipitation ion concentrations, the estimationof transboundary flows and depositions between the U.S. and Canada, andthe consequences of seasonally variable emission reduction actions.</TEXT></DOC>
