In the 1986 quarter, it earned $3.7 million, or 46 cents a share. The company, which earned 41 cents a fully diluted share in the 1986 quarter, also said revenue would fall below last year's $40.2 million.    Frank E. Baxter, Jefferies president, said that although results for June aren't yet known, &quot;commissions for April and May were approximately 10% below last year's levels.&quot; In addition to &quot;legal and administrative costs associated with the previously reported investigation&quot; by the SEC, the company also cited an anticipated write-down of $930,000 from the default of a note associated with land the company sold in 1983. It also cited trading losses and extra incentive commissions paid to its sales force.    Jefferies specializes in the so-called third market, away from stock exchanges. It fell under SEC scrutiny last year in connection with the government's continuing probe of insider trading.    In March, company founder Boyd L. Jefferies resigned as chairman, and in April, he pleaded guilty to two felony violations of federal securities laws related to market-manipulation charges that he earlier settled with the SEC. The SEC barred Mr. Jefferies from the U.S. securities business for five years and censured Jefferies andamp; Co., the Jefferies Group securities trading unit.    The felony charges didn't include insider trading, but Mr. Jefferies admitted he had engaged in a stock-parking scheme with arbitrager Ivan F. Boesky, and in a separate scheme previously identified as involving a public offering of Fireman's Fund Corp. stock. Mr. Jefferies has been cooperating with the government investigation. </TEXT></DOC>
