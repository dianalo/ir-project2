Pete Wilsonfrom unfavorable comparisons with Massachusetts Gov. WilliamWeld (Letters to the Editor, Nov. 20). However, Mr. Packardignores a few important points.   First, the California budget is hardly as lean as Mr.Wilson's supporters indicate. Despite the &quot;eight years ofDeukmejian budget cutting&quot; that Mr. Packard praises, theCalifornia budget more than doubled during the 1980s. Mr.Wilson's first budget cuts are illusory. Pete Wilsonincreased taxes by $8 billion to finance $6 billion in newspending.</LP><TEXT>   A recent article about state budgets in The New Republicreports that California has lost 100,000 manufacturing jobsin the past 17 months; yet during that time, the state hashired 50,000 more government workers.   Mr. Wilson has also piled on a series of crushingregulations that will stifle economic recovery. He signed afamily-leave bill that will hurt business competitiveness. Hehas enacted most of the provisions of the &quot;Big Green&quot;environmental initiative (which lost by a 2-to-1 margin lastyear), adding to the state bureaucracy a CaliforniaEnvironmental Protection Agency, and setting forth sweepingplans to purchase millions of dollars of &quot;wetlands&quot; and other&quot;environmentally sensitive&quot; property.   Pete Wilson has never been a fiscal conservative. He is agovernment activistperhaps the most ambitious governor thestate has seen since Pat Brown in the 1960s. The Wilsonadministration has signed onto higher taxes, increasedregulations and a more bloated bureaucracy. Such &quot;trueconservatism&quot; Californians can do without.
