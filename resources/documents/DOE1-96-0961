In the present work the authors show thatthese compounds, which contain an Si-O-P fragment in the molecule, canbe used for the synthesis of functionally substituted (dialkoxymethyl)phosphinatescontaining silicon. Thus, ethyl trimethylsilyl (diethoxymethyl)phosphonite,like silyl phosphites, adds smoothly in methylene chloride solution atthe carbonyl group of benzaldehyde or butyraldehyde with the formationof the phosphinates. The IR spectra were determined on an IKS-22 spectrometer(NaCl), the PMR spectra on a Tesla BS-467 spectrometer (standard TMS),and the {sup 13}C and {sup 31}P NMR spectra on a JEOL FX-100 spectrometerwith TMS ({sup 13}C) and an 85% solution of H{sub 3}PO{sub 4} in D{sub2}O as standards.</TEXT></DOC>
