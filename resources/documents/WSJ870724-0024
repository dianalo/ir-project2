Imperial, 70%-owned by Exxon Corp., is Canada's biggest producer of oil and natural gas liquids.    Separately, Imperial reported second-quarter net income of 193 million dollars, or 1.18 dollars a share, compared with 98 million dollars, or 60 cents a share in the year-earlier period. After unusual charges, Imperial had a net loss of 57 million dollars in the year-ago quarter. Revenue rose 11% to 2 billion dollars from 1.81 billion dollars during the quarter. </TEXT></DOC>
