The RITTA initiative is a grant(cooperative agreement) program designed to provide assistance to a limitednumber of States to plan and implement hazardous waste training and technicalassistance activities in support of the State's Resource Conservation andRecovery Act (RCRA) program. While only State agencies currently receivingfunds under RCRA section 3011 (Authorization of Assistance to States) areeligible to apply for RITTA funds, the agencies are authorized to enterinto subagreements with organizations (e.g., universities, other agencies,training centers, etc.). The objective of the RITTA grant program is toassist States in achieving environmental improvement and implementing RCRAprogram goals through the use of training and technical assistance techniques.The State program activities funded and required under the RITTA initiativewill include three components: (1) Development of a long-term plan fortraining and technical assistance activities; (2) delivery of RCRA programtraining activities for State environmental regulators; and (3) implementationof an initial pilot technical assistance project in waste minimizationfor the industrial/regulated community.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Kate Connors, Office of SolidWaste and Emergency Response (WH-562A), Office of Program Management andTechnology, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street SW., Washington,DC 20460, (202) 475-6647.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>In fiscal year 1987, the U.S. Congressissued a directive and provided an add-on appropriation of three milliondollars to EPA ``to undertake a concerted RCRA training initiative'' usingthe ``model for operator training developed and proven in the wastewaterprogram, which integrates technical assistance outreach activities, andState program development.'' EPA, in particular the Office of Solid Wasteand Emergency Response (OSWER), is responding to this mandate, as wellas to the findings of the Administrator's Task Force on Technology Transferand Training, by implementing the RCRA Integrated Training and TechnicalAssistance (RITTA) initiative. OSWER's Office of Program Management andTechnology is, in fact, supplementing the Congressional appropriation ofthree million dollars with an additional $200,000 as an expression of commitmentto State hazardous waste training and technical assistance. Through thisprogram, State environmental protection agencies that are currently receivingRCRA section 3011 (Authorization of Assistance to States) grant monieswill be eligible to compete for RITTA cooperative agreement funds. Thesefunds are to be used to: (1) Develop a State Training Action Plan (STAP);(2) develop and implement RCRA training programs for State environmentalpersonnel as called for in the STAP; and (3) develop and implement a pilottechnical assistance project in waste minimization for the industrial/regulatedcommunity. <ITAG tagnum="84">State Training Action Plan (STAP) </ITAG>The first component of the RITTA cooperative agreement program calls forStates to develop a State Training Action Plan (STAP)_a comprehensive,long-term plan to achieve RCRA program goals using training and technicalassistance techniques. Each State STAP will include:<ITAG tagnum="15">(1) An evaluation of existing State programs; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(2) A needs assessment; and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(3) A plan to improve environmental progress and achieve RCRA programgoals by developing and implementing State training and technical assistanceprograms.</ITAG>The plan will address such issues as building administrative structures,generating fiscal support, integrating training and technical assistanceand enforcement activities to achieve environmental compliance goals, institutionalizingtraining and technical assistance efforts at the State level, and buildingpublic awareness and support. <ITAG tagnum="84">RCRA Training for State Environmental Personnel </ITAG>The second component of the RITTA cooperative agreement program calls forState grant recipients to develop and implement hazardous waste trainingprograms for State personnel charged with managing environmental programs(e.g., State D.E.P., D.E.R., or E.P.A. etc. personnel, State Siting Commissionor Board members, State Health Department personnel, etc.). These trainingefforts will be directed towards: (1) Achieving the goals of the StateRCRA program through workforce development, and (2) training State employeesto develop and deliver technical assistance programs for the industrial(or regulated) community, working towards the goal of an improved environment.<ITAG tagnum="84">Technical Assistance Pilot Project for the Industrial/Regulated Community</ITAG>The third component of the RITTA cooperative agreement program calls forState grant recipients to develop and implement an initial demonstrationtechnical assistance project for the State industrial community. The demonstrationproject will be a pilot for additional technical assistance efforts asplanned under the STAP. It is anticipated that the pilot project will demonstratethe effectiveness of training and technical assistance techniques, andthrough this demonstration, generate support for subsequent projects. Inaccordance with the 1984 HSWA amendments to RCRA, which identified reductionof hazardous waste as a national goal, the focus of the pilot and technicalassistance project will be waste minimization. The goal of the pilot projectwill be to achieve a quantifiable reduction of hazardous waste generatedwithin the State. In order to be eligible to participate in the open competition for RITTAgrant awards a State environmental agency must:<ITAG tagnum="15">(1) Currently be receiving State program grants under section 3011of RCRA; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(2) Submit a Letter of Intent to participate, signed by the StateEnvironmental Agency Commissioner or Secretary, to EPA OSWER by March 15,1988; and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(3) Submit a complete grant application package to EPA OSWER by May15, 1988.</ITAG>While only States currently receiving funds under RCRA Section 3011 (Authorizationof Assistance to States) are eligible to apply for RITTA funds, the agenciesare authorized to enter into subagreements with other organizations (e.g.,universities, colleges, other agencies, training centers, etc.).A RITTA grant application package will be available in mid-January, 1988.The package will contain further information on the RITTA program, a grantapplication, and instructions for completing the application. Copies ofthe application package will be sent to each State environmental agency.Additional copies will be available from Kate Connors of OSWER at the addresslisted in the further information section.This program is eligible for intergovernmental review under Executive Order12372 and is subject to the review requirements of section 204 of the DemonstrationCities and Metropolitan Development Act.
