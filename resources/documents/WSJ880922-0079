A handful of the hazards was fixed while others are being treated as unavoidable risks, the company said.    Thiokol officials were responding to allegations last week by former company engineers that it had suppressed their reports about safety hazards associated with the booster rocket. The officials denied the allegations.    The trouble-shooters were part of a team of engineers and others who went over the redesigned booster rockets piece by piece after the explosion of the Challenger shuttle in 1986. Two former members of this same review group sued Thiokol in federal court in Chicago last week, charging the company wrongfully fired them and suppressed their concerns.    Several other engineers who were part of the unit have raised similar suppression allegations against Thiokol. A federal grand jury in Salt Lake City is looking into the allegations and has subpoenaed documents from Thiokol.    Richard Davis, a Thiokol vice president, said officials of the Chicago company reviewed 1,027 possible hazards raised by the trouble-shooting team and that some had been corrected, others were discounted and 11 were judged acceptable risks. &quot;In some cases there was no possibility of designing around them,&quot; Mr. Davis said.    Thiokol safety officials said the company and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration agreed to allow the 11 &quot;accepted risks&quot; stand uncorrected. Ross Bowman, Thiokol's vice president for safety reliability and quality assurance, said those uncorrected risks included such items as lightning hazards and the possibility that the booster rockets might not ignite simultaneously.    NASA officials have listed some 1,500 parts on the shuttle as &quot;Criticality 1&quot; risks, meaning that if they fail the shuttle would be destroyed. The parts range from the booster rockets themselves down to tiny parts. Most haven't any backups.    Steven Agee, an aerospace engineer who worked with the safety review unit in late 1986 and early 1987, said some of the hazard analyses he filed hadn't been corrected. Mr. Agee said he reported concerns with the booster rocket's nozzles and with grounding problems that could cause the rockets' highly volatile solid fuel to explode. &quot;Some of the things I reported required major repairs, which weren't made,&quot; Mr. Agee said.    Mr. Agee was one of those who sued Thiokol. In his suit he said that he personally filed 221 catastrophic hazard analyses and that, altogether, members of the project's Systems Safety Analysis Unit filed some 2,000 hazard reports. Mr. Agee claims Thiokol forwarded about 50 of the reports to NASA.    At the request of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Mr. Agee wore a hidden tape recorder during part of the time he worked at Thiokol's Brigham City, Utah, plant. He also turned over to the FBI copies of hundreds of documents related to the booster rocket project and recruited others to act as informants.    Robert Bryant, special agent in charge of the FBI's Salt Lake City office, called the inquiry &quot;a priority investigation&quot; but declined to give details. &quot;If any information came to our attention that would endanger the safety of the launch, we would have passed it on to NASA,&quot; he said.    Thiokol's Mr. Davis said the company assigned a review team from its Elkton, Md., division to study Mr. Agee's reports. He said the company had acted on nearly a dozen of the concerns. The remainder either duplicated concerns raised by other engineers or were deemed to be &quot;far-fetched&quot; and were discounted, he said.    Several former members of the safety analysis unit raised questions about the durability of the rocket's steel casing, which is supposed to be used for as many as 20 launches. A Thiokol spokesman said the company had subjected the casings to the equivalent of at least 20 launches. &quot;They functioned magnificently,&quot; he said.    Thiokol makes propulsion systems, specialty chemicals and salt. </TEXT></DOC>
