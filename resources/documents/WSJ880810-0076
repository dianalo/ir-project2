The letter merely promises further talks between the two sides, but its signing, feted with toasts at a posh San Francisco restaurant, reflects more: The Soviet Union needs high technology to modernize its huge economy, and many U.S. companies are lining up to help out.    &quot;Today we have about 200,000 personal computers in the Soviet Union,&quot; said Aleksandr Vasenkov, chief of the Soviet State Committee on Computer Technology, a high-level technology planning body. &quot;By 1990, we plan to have more than one million.&quot;    Says Marc Baily, Micropro's senior vice president of sales and marketing: &quot;We were surprised by how ready they were to make a deal.&quot;    The Micropro visit was part of a 10-day tour by the Soviet scientists to a number of American high-tech companies, including Lowell, Mass.-based Wang Laboratories. Micropro executives said the trip -- for which the U.S. initially denied and then delayed granting visas to the scientists -- marks the first Soviet delegation to visit several U.S. companies for the sole purpose of reviewing their high technology. The details of any deals struck during the trip, the Soviets said, will be negotiated later by Soviet &quot;commercial&quot; officials.    The U.S. and its allies in the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls, or Cocom, restrict technology exports to Eastern bloc countries, because they fear the components will aid those countries' militaries. Although those restrictions have been eased somewhat in recent months with the thaw in East-West relations, a Micropro spokesman said the Pentagon ordered the company not to show the Soviets its communications and computer-networking software. The spokesman said FBI agents were at the company's warehouse while the Soviets were talking with Micropro in another building during the visit, but never intervened.    The scientists' visas severely restrict their movements within the U.S. For example, the visas permit the Soviets to visit Marin County, north of San Francisco, but prevent them from venturing southward toward the Silicon Valley.    &quot;The restrictions are stupid,&quot; said Mr. Vasenkov. &quot;What are you afraid of? Why not share your technology with the rest of the human race?&quot;    Mr. Vasenkov said his nation's most pressing technological need is for mass-production equipment to build microchips and computers. (Export of such devices is still severely restricted under Cocom's rules.) He said the Soviets have proven capable of making chips and computers with their own equipment -- he said they make 256-kilobit dynamic random-access memory chips and microcomputers compatible with Internatinoal Business Machines Corp.'s XT model -- but that, &quot;it's very expensive to do everything yourself.&quot;    Boris Batalov, director of the CAD Institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, said there are a number of ways U.S. corporations can earn hard currency for sales of high-technology products in the Soviet Union. He said his institute or others can arrange for joint ventures or sales between U.S. companies and certain Soviet enterprises that deal in foreign money, like the petroleum, aviation and arms industries.    For example, said Mr. Batalov, the Soviets have a venture with a West German company to make computer monitors. Of the manufactured products, 10% to 20% are sold to West German customers, 50% are sold to Soviet enterprises for hard currency, and the remainder are sold within the Soviet Union for Soviet currency. </TEXT></DOC>
