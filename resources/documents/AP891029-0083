(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Florida horse industry sprinted fromthe gate at the beginning of the decade and was running along likea champion.   Then the $7 billion-a-year enterprise stumbled on thebackstretch and is now heading for the end of the 1980s trailinglong-reigning Kentucky and with some newcomer states closing fast.   Beyond the extravagant preparations in this Miami-area town forthe Nov. 4 Breeders' Cup races and its $10 million purse, Floridahorse breeders and others are pondering whether the state can everfulfill its goal of becoming the world's thoroughbred center.   ``We have all the factors here to dominate everyone, evenKentucky,'' said Richard Hancock, executive vice president of theFlorida Thoroughbred Breeders Association. ``But we have to pulleveryone together _ from the legislators to the track owners. It'sbeen such a crazy decade, we're just about settling down now.''   What happened in Florida, and in other horse-breeding states, isa familiar refrain for the 1980s: boom, then bust.   The horse game had everything a high-roller could want in theearly 1980s: a convenient tax shelter and entry into the glamour ofthe ``sport of kings.'' Demand for top horses nearly doubledauction prices to $50,000 or more.   ``No doubt, we were on a roll,'' said Hancock. ``But you knowwhat they say about all good things.''   It came to an end in the mid-1980s with new federal tax laws andthe slump in the oil industry, a principal source of the cashpumped into the horse industry.   The abrupt exodus of investors caused horse prices to drop,lowered the purses at many tracks and sent the sport into atailspin as the costs of maintaining and racing a thoroughbredexceeded $20,000 a year.   ``We're about now at a point where the prices of breeding ahorse can be justified by the purses earned,'' said Douglas Donn,president of Gulfstream Park in Hallandale, host of the sixthannual Breeders' Cup. ``We're entering a period of stabilization, Ibelieve.''   But others fear the 35-year-old Florida horse industry may beheading for further problems.   Dave Goldman, a horse industry analyst for the Ocala BreedersSales Co., said investors now appear to be looking for instantwinners and losing interest in the longer and costly process ofbreeding, which could lead to lower-quality horses in cominggenerations.   ``It's just like building a baseball team,'' said StanleyErsoff, a Miami attorney and horse breeder. ``You can have a greatfarm system and bring up quality players each year, or you can goout and buy talent.''   No matter now the industry fares, the stakes are high.   The state breeders' association reports nearly 29,000 people areemployed in the Florida horse industry and the state has more than300,000 race horses valued at $630 million. In Florida, the horseindustry trails only tourism and citrus crops in revenue invested,said Hancock.   And the group boasts that 20 percent of all U.S. stakes racesare won by Florida-bred horses, although the state produces only9.1 percent of the thoroughbred foals.   Kentucky, however, is still a long way from losing itsreputation as the thoroughbred capital.   Nearly a fifth of all the nation's thoroughbred horses are bredin Kentucky, and the famous ``blue grass'' is still sought out bytop trainers.   Meanwhile, other states are galloping ahead with incentiveprograms to lure thoroughbred breeding and related businesses.   Between 1976 and 1986, the number of New York-bred foalsincreased 321 percent and the crop in Louisiana and Illinois jumpedmore than 175 percent each, according to The Jockey Club, thenational register of thoroughbreds.   ``Other states really protect and cultivate their horse industryfrom the statehouse on down,'' said Harry Mangurian Jr., formerowner of the Boston Celtics basketball team and a top horse breederin the Ocala area. ``In Florida, by and large, we do not get theattention needed. I wonder if the state recognizes how importantthis industry is.''   ``The money is still in Kentucky. The top five or so horses arethere,'' said Hank Steinbrenner, who runs an Ocala horse farm alongwith his father, New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner III.   With the Breeders' Cup drawing national attention to Florida, anongoing debate about off-track betting in the state hasintensified. Proponents say it would increase public interest inracing and raise the purses at the state's five horse tracks.   But lawmakers have been slow to push the issue. A stronganti-gambling bloc fought hard against the state's 20-month-oldlottery. Also, the owners of the state's 18 dog tracks and 12 jaialai frontons have lobbied heavily against OTB.</TEXT></DOC>
