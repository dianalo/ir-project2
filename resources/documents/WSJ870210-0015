A Black andamp; Decker Corp. West German mark issue met weak demand.    Dollar bonds declined 1/4 to 3/8 point for longer maturities and about 1/4 point for medium-term issues in a session dominated by uncertainty about the dollar and the U.S. economy.    The dollar fell against the mark and the yen. U.S. Treasurys also were lower. The 7 1/2% bonds due 2016 were quoted at 99 25/32, down 21/32 from the New York level late Friday.    Cargill Inc, a privately held Minnetonka, Minn., grain trader, issued $150 million of non-callable 8 1/4% Eurobonds due 1997. New-issue specialists said the bonds performed reasonably well despite strong selling pressure on seasoned 10-year dollar issues late in the day. Launched by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets at 100 3/4 to yield 8.14%, the Cargill bonds were quoted at less 2 1/4 bid, less 2 1/2 points offered.    In mark foreign bonds, Black andamp; Decker launched the equivalent of $55.3 million in 5 3/4% bonds due 1994 and redeemable in 1992. Issued at 100 3/4 to yield 5.62%, the single-A-rated bonds closed at less 3 bid, traders at lead manager CSFB-Effectenbank AG said.    Syndicate managers who declined to participate said the name is well-known and the seven-year maturity is a good length, given the market. But the issue was too tightly priced for the single-A rated company, they said.    Black andamp; Decker said it will use proceeds to pay short-term debt that it incurred in 1986 primarily to retire certain high-interest, long-term debt. Based in Towson, Md., Black andamp; Decker makes power tools and household appliances.    Most mark domestic bonds fell slightly.    Meanwhile, most Swiss franc foreign bonds ended the day unchanged in calm trading.    Traders and syndicate managers said there was little market reaction to news that Union Bank of Switzerland, Credit Suisse and Swiss Volksbank cut their medium-term cash bond interest rates after a similar move last week by Zurich Kantonalbank. </TEXT></DOC>
