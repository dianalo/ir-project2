(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Operators of the Seabrook nuclear powerplant warmed the reactor for its first low-power testing, butopponents planned to turn up some heat of their own with a newround of mass protests.   ``The confrontation must come now. It's never been moreimportant,'' said Paul Gunter, a founder of the Clamshell Allianceanti-nuclear group and veteran of its first sit-in at Seabrook 13years ago. ``Thirteen years of opposition have made the issuescrystal clear, and now is really a testing time, both for the plantand the opposition.''   Operators began heating the reactor Saturday in preparation forthe first atomic chain reaction, expected within seven to 10 days.The test will be the biggest milestone yet for a plant that is adecade behind schedule, billions of dollars over budget and a focusof the nation's anti-nuclear movement.   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission gave Seabrook a low-powerlicense Friday, the day after a federal appeals court refused toblock the tests.   Meanwhile, demonstrators have been meeting with local and statepolice to make final plans for a rally Saturday and civildisobedience Sunday. Some activists plan to try to climb fencessurrounding the plant.   Edward Brown, president of New Hampshire Yankee, which operatesthe plant, said the planned demonstration will not affect thetesting.   But critics say the protests will be an important indicator ofthe depth and perserverance of public opposition to Seabrook as the$6 billion plant enters the last stretch of its protractedlicensing struggle.   ``I think it's real important to show the political leadershipin this state there is real concern about this project, and they'reignoring it at their peril _ and boy, are they ignoring it,'' saidRobert Backus, who has worked as a lawyer for 17 years for groupsopposing the plant.   Originally planned to start producing electricity in 1979,Seabrook overcame construction permit suspensions, job actions andfinancial crises to be completed in July 1986.   The project won NRC approval for tests on May 18, but thecommission granted a one-week stay of the license pending a federalcourt review.   Last Thursday, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for theDistrict of Columbia declined requests to delay the tests. Thelicense allowing Seabrook to conduct tests at up to 5 percent offull power was issued Friday by the NRC's Office of Nuclear ReactorRegulation.   The plant must win federal approval for evacuation plans fornearby communities before it can operate commercially.   Seabrook's opponents say the plant represents health and safetyrisks for people living in crowded beaches and coastal communitieswithin 10 miles of the plant. Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakisand other foes have promised to continue their fight even if itmeans going to the U.S. Supreme Court.   The water in the nuclear reactor's cooling system reached 200degrees on Monday. The reactor must reach 557 degrees, expected totake five days, before preparations can begin to start the nuclearchain reaction in the 100 tons of uranium fuel.   ``Everything's going smoothly and as planned,'' Seabrookspokesman Ron Sher said. ``We want to conduct low-power tests assoon as possible to make sure there are no adjustments we need tomake to the plant.''   ``I think that most people see that the plant will be licensed,and I think that most people agree that it's in the region's bestinterests,'' said Rob Williams, another spokesman.   But Gunter finds hope in the case of the Shoreham nuclear powerplant on New York's Long Island. Nearly four years after Shorehamstarted low-power tests but before it ever operated commercially,its owner is on the verge of signing a deal with the state to scrapthe reactor in return for guaranteed rate increases for the nextdecade.   The Clamshell Alliance, an umbrella organization for regionalanti-nuclear groups, has organized demonstrations against Seabrooksince construction began in 1976. A May 1977 protest culminated in1,414 arrests and gained national attention for the anti-nuclearmovement.   ``We've faced many disappointments in this struggle, andlow-power testing may be another disappointment. It will be a pointof no return for the citizenry of New England,'' Gunter said.</TEXT></DOC>
