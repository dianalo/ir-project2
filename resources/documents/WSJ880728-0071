He said he expects a new bargaining meeting with car-hauling employers soon.    The rank-and-file voted 9,122-to-3,535, or 72%, against the contract, the Teamsters said. Under the union constitution, a two-thirds vote against a labor pact is needed for leaders to call a strike.    A meeting of Teamsters negotiators was set for Monday, to plan bargaining strategy. The union struck car haulers over a 1985 contract, but locals don't want to strike this time, largely because the action is seen as having little clout while auto makers are closed for model changeover.    Mr. McCarthy apparently went along with those wishes. He had challenged the previous Teamsters leadership's decision to declare ratified a master freight accord with trucking firms, despite a 64% vote against it, and has said he wants to improve that pact.    Many union car-haul drivers were reported unhappy with the contract, which expired June 1. They complained, among other things, that basic wage increases of 40 cents an hour annually over three years were 33% lower than increases they got in 1985. </TEXT></DOC>
