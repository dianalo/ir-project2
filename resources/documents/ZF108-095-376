Okidata Group (products).andO;Product:   Okidata OkiLaser 400 (Computer printer).andO;Topic:     EvaluationLaser Printers.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>OkidataandM;OKILASER 400andM;Square and squat, the OkiLaser 400 takes up less than an 18-inch square ofdesktop space, not counting the 6 inches its 200-sheet paper tray sticks outof the slanted front of the 5-1/4-inch-tall machine.andP;  The OkiLaser isinexpensive and at the slow end of the spectrum.andM;The OkiLaser uses a two-cartridge system: a $289 imaging drum, good for 8,000to 14,000 pages, and a low-cost $33 toner cartridge, good for about 2,500pages at 5 percent density.andP;  While the imaging drum loaded easily in testing,the toner proved a bit more difficult in that two hard-to-move tabs must beengaged to open the cartridge.andP;  Notwithstanding the tabs, the Okidatacartridge leaked a trace of toner during the loading process.andM;Standard equipment includes four built-in typefaces of various sizes for atotal of 19 fonts that emulate the fonts in Hewlett-Packard's A, B, C, F andL font cartridges (when the OkiLaser 400 is operated in itsLaserJet-emulation mode).andP;  A narrow slot on the left side of the OkiLaseraccepts thin Okidata font cartridges, which are software compatible (notphysically compatible) with many cartridges in the Hewlett-Packard line.andM;All the requisite controls are located on a small, nearly square panel on theleft of the OkiLaser's front panel, including an LCD display that's chieflyused to display error messages.andM;The covered input paper tray slides into the OkiLaser 400 with enoughdifficulty to push the lightweight (23-pound) printer across a desktop.andO;Single-sheet guides are available at the top of the paper holder.andM;The OkiLaser 400 will handle paper weights up to 24 pounds, letter- andlegal-size paper (the legal-size paper tray is optional), labels,transparencies and envelopes.andP;  Finished sheets feed out of either the top(face down, automatically collated) or out of the rear (face up).andP;  The rearoutput tray neatly folds into the back of the printer when not in use.andM;The paper-feeding mechanism of the evaluation unit proved the only one withpoor performance in testing.andP;  It nicked or dimpled every sheet it pulledthrough.andM;The documentation is contained in four manuals.andP;  At first, finding what'sneeded may require some shuffling, but soon all the manuals becomeunnecessary.andM;Okidata, of Mount Laurel, N.J., can be contacted at (800) 654-3282.andM;----------Buyers say .andP;  .  .andM;Due to its recent shipping, PC Week was able to interview only evaluators ofthe new OkiLaser 400.andP;  Of that group, users were most interested in theprinter's size and built-in fonts.andM;&quot;I liked the fact that I didn't need a cartridge to change the fonts, like Ido with HP,&quot; said Gary Latonick, a specialist in operations analysis atGeneral Electric Co. in Princeton, N.J.andP;  &quot;It seemed to have a lot of fontsalready built into it.&quot;andM;Latonick also liked the size of the printer.andP;  &quot;Compared to theHewlett-Packard [LaserJet Series II], the OkiLaser 400 is light.andP;  It's solight that it was easy to move around the office from desk to desk.&quot;andM;Jim Hoff, a regional sales manager at General Electric Co. offices in SouthPlainfield, N.J., agreed.andP;  &quot;We evaluated it for eight weeks and it workedfine,&quot; Hoff said.andP;  &quot;We especially liked the small footprint.andP;  It was smallenough to fit in a tight spot at our office.&quot;andM;Although he is used to the 8-ppm speed of his other laser printer, theOkiLaser's 4 pages per minute isn't bad, Hoff added.andP;  &quot;You'd think there'd bea big difference between 4 and 8 pages per minute, but there's not,&quot; he said.andO;&quot;We didn't know that before we tested the Okidata, and it opened our eyes inthat respect.&quot;andM;Both Latonic and Hoff are considering purchasing the OkiLaser 400 but havenot yet made a final decision.andM;</TEXT></DOC>
