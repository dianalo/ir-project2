Now some of themare doing something about it.   A few major players in the junk bond market have signed upto try an untested weekly auction of junk bonds.</LP><TEXT>   Scheduled to start a month from now, the auctions are thebrainchild of a one-man operation known as New YorkSecurities Auction Corp., or Nysac. Founded by 32-year-oldinvestment manager Joel Greenblatt, Nysac says it already hasattracted the attention of a number of heavy hittersincluding Fidelity Investments, Mutual Shares Corp., TrustCo. of the West, 1838 Investment Advisors L.P., RelianceStandard Life Insurance Co. and others.   Michael Price, who runs the successful Mutual Sharesmutual fund operation, said the new system will provideanother way in which he can search for good buys. &quot;We'regoing to try to pick up bargains in Nysac,&quot; he said.   The auction bidding will take place via computer and willbe carried on the Bloomberg Financial System of electronicterminals. Sellers can set a minimum price they'll accept,much as an art owner might at a Sotheby's or Christie's sale.   Mr. Greenblatt said the auctions should reduce the cost oftrading junk securities and make them easier to buy or sell.Trading costs and the difficulty of finding trading partnersare sore points in the $200 billion junk-bond market.   Unlike stocks, whose prices are widely disseminated, mostjunk bonds are traded through brokers who set their ownprices. As a result, money managers complain that junk bondbrokers sometimes significantly overcharge customers fortheir trades.   &quot;Right now, nobody really knows the true price of a junkbond because of the huge spreads that brokers take on,&quot; saidTom Mandel, a high-yield portfolio manager at 1838 InvestmentAdvisors. &quot;There is a reasonable amount of deception thatgoes on sometimes.&quot;   It isn't unusual for junk bond traders to buy bonds fromsellers at one price and resell them at a price as much asthree or even four points higher, investors say. That is anenormous spread. In the bond market, one point translatesinto $10 for a bond with a $1,000 face value.   With Nysac, junk securities will be auctioned at a cost ofperhaps 1/2 to 3/4 point paid by the buyer, Mr. Greenblattsaid. The first auction is planned for July 1618.   Money managers are intrigued by the plan, though theyaren't sure how big the auctions will get. The auctions, theysay, will probably attract the more obscure and distressedissues of high-yield junk. Less likely to appear are the&quot;good junk&quot; bonds with such well-known names as Kroger andSafeway, which trade at relatively small discounts from facevalue; these are already easily sold through brokers. Junkbonds that are actively traded on exchanges, such as thoseissued by RJR Nabisco Inc., aren't expected to appear onNysac's auction list, either. Nysac said it won't bid onsecurities or carry positions.   &quot;The greatest use of this system will be during times ofreal distress when the junk bond market shuts down and stopsfunctioning,&quot; said Howard Marks, a managing director at TrustCo. of the West and a big buyer of junk bonds. &quot;Maybe thiswill keep things flowing. It certainly can't hurt.&quot;   Mutual Shares' Mr. Price said of Mr. Greenblatt: &quot;This isa bright young man who is making a serious attempt to trysomething new. He doesn't know whether it will work, but he'strying to bring an alternative.&quot;   Money managers appear eager to try the new system, whichthey said could serve in some cases as an alternative totrading through brokerage firms. They said the auctions wouldhelp &quot;open up&quot; the junk bond market, where the governmentwants to see price information become more readily available.   Mr. Greenblatt isn't exactly a household name on WallStreet. He is a managing partner of Gotham Capital in NewYork, an investment firm where he says he manages a $40million hedge fund. Prior to joining Gotham, he was a generalpartner at Halcyon Investments.   The securities up for auction, he says, will appear weeklyin an advertisement placed in Barron's, a magazine publishedby Dow Jones andamp; Co., which also publishes this newspaper.Beside appearing on Bloomberg, Mr. Greenblatt said, the listprobably will run on other electronic services in the future.   A bit of skepticism was voiced by Kingman Penniman, asenior vice president at McCarthy, Crisanti andamp; Maffei, aninvestment research firm. He likes the concept but wouldprefer a &quot;completely open&quot; auction where the best bid wins,even if it's below the minimum asking price.   In addition to junk bonds, Nysac hopes to auction other&quot;illiquid&quot; securities including obscure investment-gradecorporate bonds, low-priced Pink Sheets stocks and certainstocks and warrants that trade on the National Association ofSecurities Dealers Automated Quotations System, or Nasdaq.</TEXT></DOC>
