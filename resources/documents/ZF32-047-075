Whyis there a rumor floating around that the members of the original Mac teamare trying to recall the Mac Plus so they can scratch their names off theinside of the cases? And what does it mean for you?andM;Our armchair corporate psychoanalysis begins in Detroit in the 1970s.andP;  Whenthe major U.S.andP;  auto makers started announcing joint ventures with theirJapanese counterparts, the cry of &quot;Buy American!&quot; rang loud and strong.andP;  Itcould hardly be otherwise; a country self-centered enough to call a purelydomestic championship the &quot;World&quot; Series was not about to quietly concedefirst place in something as all-American as the auto industry.andM;But as Detroit discovered, when the stakes get high enough, there is nolonger any such thing as being No.andP;  1; cooperation is as important ascompetition.andM;The major players need to make sure the basic car designs are similar enoughthat if you can drive one, you can drive them all.andP;  They need to worktogether to keep all of their major component vendors in business.andP;  They needto ensure the continuing existence of a trained work force.andP;  And they need tomaximize productivity by sharing resources and expertise -- without givingaway the store.andM;Likewise, Apple simply can never become No.andP;  1 in the computer industry.andP;  Notnecessarily because it isn't the best, but because its own survival dependson no one -- at least no one too big -- losing.andP;  If Apple somehow drove IBMout of business tomorrow, Apple wouldn't win; it would soon follow suit,because the whole industry would quickly fall apart.andM;And just as Detroit missed the boat when Japan's compact, energy-efficientcars took the market by storm, Apple missed the first wave of laptop andnotebook fever.andP;  To catch up fast, it had to do something big.andM;It's a Wonderful LifeandM;Cross-platform, object-oriented, multimedia, enterprisewide, client/servercomputing is big, all right -- at least if you're counting syllables.andP;  Whatit means is that developers can devote more of their time to thinking up newsoftware ideas and fleshing out how their programs should work and less timeto the actual process of writing lines of code.andP;  Developers can move fromconcept to finished product more quickly, so there's more incentive for themto create specialized tools that match vertical applications you need, suchas legal billing or academic courseware.andP;  It also means that, rather thanalways being forced into the Ginsu-knife approach to software -- it slices,it dices, it subtotals, it does Beziers -- developers can afford to createsmall, focused little gems of software that do one thing and do itexquisitely.andM;Unless .andP;  .  .andM;Unless the deal falls apart.andP;  In which case Apple wins.andP;  So far, Apple hasgiven up nothing, but it has gained the IBM imprimatur.andP;  Just by sitting downat the negotiating table with Apple, IBM has given the Mac its indelible sealof approval, and no amount of backpedaling can take that away.andM;But the deal will happen.andP;  It will happen because it must happen.andP;  Thealternative is more losses, layoffs, cutbacks, and restructurings -- and nomore company BMWs.andM;And like Hollywood, Silicon Valley likes a happy ending.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
