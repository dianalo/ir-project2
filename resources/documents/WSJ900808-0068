The estimated postal deficit for the fiscal year endingSept. 30 will be less than $1 billion, compared with the $1.6billion loss originally projected, Postmaster General AnthonyFrank told his board of governors and a news conference. Hecredited the narrowing to productivity gains, which have beenescalating over the past 12 months, reaching 3.4% in thequarter ended June 30.</LP><TEXT>   The benefits of a major postal automation program and arecently imposed ceiling on employment levels are responsiblefor improving productivity, Mr. Frank said. The PostalService has been installing automatic equipment that readsenvelopes and sorts them according to nine-digit addresscodes. Hiring curbs also have helped reduce its work force by23,000, to 764,000, since June 1989, officials said.   But Mr. Frank said the improvement isn't sufficient toalter the plan to boost rates by an average of 19%, includingan increase of five cents to 30 cents for first-classservice. The rise would occur early in 1991, afterconsideration by the Postal Rate Commission.   In defending the rate increase's size, Mr. Frank noted theuncertainty over how well the agency can do in holding downlabor costs in talks with unions, which begin late thismonth, and the White House budget office's efforts to requirethe service to contribute $1.3 billion to U.S. deficitreduction.</TEXT></DOC>
