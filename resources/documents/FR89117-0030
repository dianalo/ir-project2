Background</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Under section 644 of the Department of Energy Organization Act, Pub.L. 95-91 (42 U.S.C. 7254), the Secretary of Energy is authorized to prescribesuch procedural rules and regulations as may be deemed necessary or appropriateto accomplish the functions vested in the position. Accordingly, the Departmentof Energy Acquisition Regulation (DEAR) was promulgated with an effectivedate of April 1, 1984 (49 FR 11922, March 28, 1984), 48 CFR Chapter 9.</ITAG>The primary purpose of this proposed rule is to revise the DEAR, as necessary,to implement recent changes to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR),which is codified at 48 CFR Chapter 1. As a result, the following sectionsand subsections would be affected. Subsection 901.603-71 would be renumberedas 901.602-3 to conform to the numbering of the corresponding FAR sectionand is proposed to be modified to reflect current delegations of authorityand revised procedures. Section 904.404 is proposed to be revised to identifythe appropriate listing of sensitive foreign nations that shall be used.Section 906.303(a)(1) is deleted to reflect the obligation of DOE officesto justify extension of management and operating contracts in accordancewith CICA. Proposed section 908.7121 would reflect the new office responsiblefor maintaining the DOE supply of precious metals. Section 913.505 is proposedto be revised by adding a new section on the use of Standard Form 44, PurchaseOrder-Invoice-Voucher. Proposed subsection 916.301-3 would permit contractingofficers to approve Determinations and Findings related to cost-type contracts.Section 935.014 would be removed. Section 942.1004 would be updated toreflect the current address for submission of IRandamp;D/Bandamp;P Proposals.Proposed section 945.101 would increase the threshold in the definitionof ``capital equipment'' from $1,000 to $5,000. Subsection 945.5205-5 isproposed to be revised to reflect changes in the property reporting requirements.Subsection 945.505-14 is proposed to be revised to reflect changes in theasset codes. Subsection 945.607-2 is proposed to be revised to reflectthe name of the new contractor as well as new address for the submissionof precious metal scrap reports. A new subsection 945.608-6 is proposedto be added to identify the designee authorized to approve waivers of screeningrequirements. Subsections 970.3102-16 and 970.5204-13 would be revisedto correct typographical errors. The clause in subsection 970.5204-27 isrevised to reflect application of the clause to the employee of a managementand operating contractor as a consultant to another organization in anyfield and not solely to the ``atomic energy'' field.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Procedural Requirements</ITAG>A. Review Under Executive Order 12291This Executive order, entitled ``Federal Regulations,'' requires that certainregulations be reviewed by OMB prior to their promulgation. The OMB hasconcluded its review and has no objections to the proposed change.B. Review Under the Regulatory Flexibility ActThis rule was reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, Pub.L. 96-354, which requires preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysisfor any rule which is likely to have significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities. This rule will have no impact on interest rates,tax policies or liabilities, the cost of goods or services, or other directeconomic factors. It will also not have any indirect economic consequences,such as changed construction rates. DOE certifies that this rule will nothave significant economc impact on a substantial number of small entitiesand, therefore, no regulatory flexibility analysis has been prepared.C. Review Under the Paperwork Reduction ActThe information collections in this rule have been cleared by the Officeof Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of the Paperwork ReductionAct of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), and OMB's implementing regulationsat 5 CFR Part 1320.D. Review Under Executive Order 12612Executive Order 12612, 52 FR 41685 (October 30, 1987), requires that regulations,rules, legislation, and any other policy actions be reviewed for any substantialdirect effects on States, on the relationship between the national governmentand the States, or in the distribution of power and responsibilities amongvarious levels of government. If there are sufficient substantial directeffects, then the Executive Order requires preparation of a federalismassessment to be used in all decisions involved in promulgating and implementinga policy action.Today's proposed rule, when finalized, will revise certain policy and proceduralrequirements, for purpose of clarification and updating, without alteringtheir substance. States which contract with DOE will be subject to therevisions. However, the Department of Energy has determined that none ofthe revisions will have a substantial direct effect on the institutionalinterests or traditional function of States.E. National Environmental Policy ActDOE has concluded that promulgation of this rule would not represent amajor Federal action having significant impact on the human environmentunder the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 432et seq.) (1976) or the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations (40CFR Part 1020) and, therefore, does not require an environmental impactstatement or an environmental assessment pursuant to NEPA.F. Public HearingThe Department has concluded that this proposed rule does not involve asubstantial issue of fact or law and that the rule should not have a substantialimpact on the nation's economy or large numbers of individuals or businesses.Therefore, pursuant to Pub. L. 95-91, the DOE Organization Act, the Departmentdoes not plan to hold a public hearing on this proposed rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">III.
