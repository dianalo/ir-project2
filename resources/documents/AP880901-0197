(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   PTL founder Jim Bakker may be back ontelevision as soon as next week, the ministry's bankruptcy trusteesaid Thursday as lawyers worked on details of Bakker's $165 millionplan to buy back PTL.   Trustee M.C. Benton said he received offers of $120 million and$114 million Thursday, the last day he was taking bids for theministry's assets. Both were larger than the previously announcedoffer of $113 million from Canadian real estate magnate PeterThomas, chairman of Samoth Capital Corp.   Benton said the offers were from American groups and that theyhad not been mentioned previously, but he declined to be morespecific. He said he did not anticipate getting an offer higherthan Bakker's.   A $3 million letter of credit that should be ready in a day orso will secure Bakker's deal, said his attorney Ryan Hovis during anews conference at the World Outreach Center at Heritage USA,headquarters for the PTL.   Benton and Hovis would release no details about the unidentifiedGreek financiers who are backing Bakker's deal.   New Covenant Partners Inc. is being formed to buy PTL, Hovissaid. The contract being negotiated calls for creditors to get cashpayments and for securing the benefits of major PTL donors.   The deal calls for Bakker to pay $85 million in cash and to paythe Internal Revenue Service the money it is owed. That amount isbeing disputed.   Bakker said he will obtain an $80 million mortgage on 1,000acres of undeveloped property at PTL.   Hovis said Bakker may lease facilities from the bankruptcytrustee until the deal can be closed. Benton said during the newsconference that Bakker could be back on the air as early as Sept. 9.   Benton has until Sept. 10 to bring a buyer to U.S. BankruptcyJudge Rufus Reynolds, who will decide who gets to buy the ministry,although his decision can be appealed to U.S. District Court.   A spokeswoman in Reynolds' office in Greensboro, N.C., saidThursday the judge could not comment on a pending case. The judgehas not said when he will decide on the buyer, but has said hewants to sell the ministry as soon as possible to pay off creditorsand keep Heritage USA operating.   Benton said he had not talked to Reynolds about the possibilityof Bakker regaining control of the ministry he left in March 1987,when he resigned amid allegations of misuse of money andrevelations of his sexual encounter with church secretary JessicaHahn.   PTL filed for bankruptcy reorganization in June 1987.   The trustee said the law requires that he secure the bestfinancial deal for the creditors and that his own opinion of Bakkeris not relevant to his job.   ``It's not what I believe, it's what bankruptcy law says myobligation here is,'' Benton said.   Lawyers said among the things still being discussed are what todo with Heritage Ministries, a newly formed non-profit organizationthat includes the ministry's religious operations.   The president of Heritage Ministries, Don Edwards, has said hewill not stay if Bakker returns, ``whether he (Bakker) would wantme or not.''   Heritage Village Church pastor Sam Johnson also has said hewould not remain under Bakker's leadership.</TEXT></DOC>
