Three groups of specimens were tested:Insulation materials for inner cavity wall, ceramic boards for apertureand protective materials to be used like a passive quick closing deviceto shield aperture and door in emergency cases. Items of investigationwere: Time of survival under different solar flux levels, thermal shockresistance, solar reflectivity, solar transmission and temperature gradient.Types of materials tested included refractory board of alumina fiber,alumina-silicon carbide and zirconia, boron-nitrite and other insulationmaterials. Optical properties of materials under highly concentratedsolar radiations were measured at MAN (West Germany) using a xenon arc-lampsimulator. Solar tets were carried out on Lajet concentrator at ASINELTest Facility for the last three years. Microstructural transformations(devitrifications, melting, etc.) of tested samples have been followedby XRD, SEM and EDX techniques and related to their behaviour and optical,thermal and mechanical properties.</TEXT></DOC>
