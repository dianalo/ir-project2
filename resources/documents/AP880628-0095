Monday night's rally was the largest unofficial demonstration inHungary since an anti-Soviet uprising was crushed in 1956. Policeprotected the embassy compound but did not interfere.   The protest was organized by a dozen opposition and otherunofficial groups, but it was officially authorized by police inthis Communist country.   ``Observers, watching the crowd and listening to the sloganschanted, felt the demonstration was pervaded not only bydiscipline, the knowledge of representing a just cause ... but anawareness of Central European consciousness ...,'' the governmentnewspaper Magyar Hirlap said today.   Before the march to the embassy, about 30,000 people gathered ondowntown Heroes' Square to hear speeches denouncing the forcibleresettlement plan, according to the official Hungarian news agencyMTI.   The proposed plan to raze about 7,000 of Romania's 13,000villages, which would affect hundreds of communities of people ofHungarian and German heritage, has strained Hungarian-Romanianrelations.   ``The demonstration reflected the anxiety Hungarian societyfeels about the fate of the villages in Romania and the fact thatit is not accepting that `bulldozer policy' as a government policyin these concluding years of the 20th century.''   Unofficial demonstrations of up to 15,000 people have been heldbefore, but they were never sanctioned and sometimes dispersed byforce.   Smaller unofficial demonstrations have been staged in Hungarybefore, but they were never sanctioned and sometimes dispersed byforce.   The crowd moved slowly past, shouting protests, then marchedback to the square, laying flowers at monuments to Hungarian kings.   They also heard a message of solidarity from Lech Walesa, theleader of the banned Polish free trade union movement Solidarity.   Banners denounced the resettlement and scores of demonstratorsheld up signs of place names in Hungarian, German and Romanian thatthey fear will vanish from the map.   In March, President Nicolae Ceausescu of Romania announced plansfor demolishing 7,000 villages, which would be replaced by bigagricultural-industrial centers.   Romanian state-run media have said the program aims to gain morefarmland for use by the country's collectivized agriculture, whichis plagued by lack of incentives for farmers and livestock foddershortages.   The forced resettlement program would affect hundreds ofvillages of Romania's 1.7 million ethnic Hungarians, who complainof official discrimination and say they are denied ethnic andcultural rights.   A manifesto read to Monday's crowd said: ``After 50 years, thereis another criminal committing genocide.''   Hungarian intellectuals have denounced as genocide both theproject for demolishing villages and Romania's alleged policy ofdiscrimination against ethnic Hungarians.   Monday's manifesto also referred to the mass murder of Jews andother civilians committed by the Nazis before and during World WarII.   The document was written by Istvan Csurka, a prominent Hungarianopposition writer, and read by actor Istvan Bubik. It combinedappeals for restraint and for solidarity with ethnic Hungarians inRomania.   Csurka appealed to Hungarians to show solidarity anddetermination in trying to prevent what the Magyar Nemzet newspaperearlier Monday called Romania's ``bulldozer revolution.''   Relations between neighboring Warsaw Pact nations havedeteriorated rapidly over the issue of ethnic Hungarians.</TEXT></DOC>
