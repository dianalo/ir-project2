In a brief supporting Fidelity Management andamp; Research Co.,the agency said that forcing committee members to refrainfrom trading would discourage big financial institutions fromserving on the panels. That, in turn, would be &quot;contrary tothe best interests of public investors.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The commission states its opinion in the Ohiobankruptcy-court case of Allied Stores Corp. FidelityManagement andamp; Research, the adviser to the Fidelity group ofmutual funds, has filed a motion with the court arguing thatit wouldn't be violating its fiduciary duty as a member ofthe bondholders committee if it trades Allied bonds duringthe proceeding.   Fidelity has assured the court that it has set upappropriate &quot;firewalls&quot; that would not allow its tradingorganization to have advance knowledge of what the committeeis doing.   But the U.S. trustee in the case countered that tradingwhile on the panel would breach fiduciary duty to thecommittee.   The SEC sided with Fidelity, arguing that even thoughcommittee members are &quot;temporary insiders,&quot; they should beallowed to serve. &quot;The absolute trading bar urged by the U.S.trustee is not required by the bankruptcy laws or the federalsecurities laws,&quot; the brief said, &quot;and would likely deprivethe Official Bondholders' Committee of the expertise thatcommittee members could otherwise provide.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
