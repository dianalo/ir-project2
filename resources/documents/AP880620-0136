Charles E.Grassley said today.   Attorney General Edwin Meese III denied the accusation, sayingat a news conference that the prosecution of defense procurementcases has been one of the department's top priorities and that ``atno time has this department had to be dragged into any indictmentwhere the evidence is there.''   Grassley, R-Iowa, said in a floor speech that a top JusticeDepartment official grabbed the microphone from the investigator inOctober 1985, as the investigator was about to testify about hisfindings.   Grassley, who chaired the House Judiciary subcommittee at thetime, said, ``I stopped the hearing at that point. I wish now Ihadn't. There wasnt anything in that testimony that could havejeopardized that case.''   ``The public must be made aware of the fact that the JusticeDepartment was asleep at switch,'' Grassley said, because it wasinvestigating a single company and ignoring reports of widespreadabuse in procurement, including bribery.   The October 1985 testimony alleged that private consultants wereregularly receiving classified details about U.S. weapons systems.   ``The Justice Department could have pursued this aggressivelymore than three years ago but they didn't,'' he said in an earlierinterview with the Associated Press.   The 2-year-old probe has focused chiefly on Navy weapons-buying.It became public last week when FBI and Naval Investigative Serviceagents conducted coast-to-coast raids on the offices of past andpresent Pentagon officials, private consultants and contractors.   U.S. Attorney Henry Hudson has said privately that perhaps asmany as 200 indictments could be expected out of the investigation,a government source said Sunday.   In October 1985 Grassley was chairman of the Senate Judiciaryadministrative practices subcommittee, a panel which he used toexamine defense procurement practices. Grassley is a frequentcritic of what he calls widespread waste and abuse in Pentagonspending.   Grassley said Justice Department officials blocked the testimonyof Robert Segal, a Defense Department investigator who was thePentagon's liaison with the Justice Department's DefenseProcurement Fraud Unit. The DPFU was a special Justice Departmentoffice set up to investigate waste in the military budget.   It was well known in the Justice Department that some elementsof the Pentagon and the Justice Department held DPFU in low esteemand there is speculation that when the current allegations firstcame to light the matter was steered away from the agency and intoHudson's office.   Segal, who worked for the Pentagon's Defense CriminalInvestigative Service, was prepared to testify that privateconsultants regularly received classified Pentagon documents thatshould not have been available outside the government, Grassleysaid.   Segal also reported at the time that ``many of these (defense)companies appear to have espionage units whose main function is toobtain copies of highly classified documents in order to give theircompanies a competitive edge,'' Grassley said.   Grassley said the allegations predated the currentinvestigation. ``This goes back much before what we're seeingnow,'' he said.   Segal's testimony, which he never got to deliver but which wasreleased publicly at the time, said that a defense procurementcriminal case against GTE Corp. ``is but the tip of the proverbialiceberg. ... The investigation involves at least 25 companies. ...Many of those companies are household words. ... The primary focusof the case is ... the indiscriminate distribution of bothproprietary and highly classified government documents byindividuals within and without the government.''   Justice Department official Victoria Toensing interrupted thekey part of Segal's testimony before he could give it and demandedthat it be halted, saying that he was touching on areas thatconcerned criminal matters pending against GTE.   After the contents of Segal's testimony came out in the newsmedia, the Justice Department issued a statement saying that ``Therelease by Sen. Grassley's staff of erroneous, misleading andinflammatory information about a criminal case that is currentlypending trial is most unfortunate and regrettable. ... Justice mustnot be allowed to become a political football.''   Responding to Grassley, Meese told a news conference that``Investigating and prosecuting defense procurement fraud has beenone of the department's top priorities for several years.'' Theattorney general said that since 1985, the defense procurementfraud unit has obtained about 43 indictments and criminalinformations in significant cases, has obtained 35 convictions andhas recovered some $32 million.   When asked about Segal's testimony that the department had notvigorously pursued the passing along of confidential information,Meese said that ``I can assure you that at no time has thisdepartment had to be dragged into any indictment where the evidenceis there.'' Meese also said there were a number of spin-off casesthat grew out of the GTE probe which are being prosecuted. He didnot identify them.   President Reagan, attending a summit meeting of the leaders ofwestern democracies in Toronto, refused to comment Sunday onreports that former Navy Secretary John Lehman Jr. may have warnedhis longtime ally, military consultant Melvyn Paisley, that Paisleywas under investigation.   ``I am not going to comment until we have all the information,''Reagan said.   Lehman has not returned numerous phone calls from The AssociatedPress seeking comment.   Paisley, a former top Navy official and close friend of Lehman,has emerged as a principal target of the investigation. The FBI islooking at Paisley's dealings with a number of major defensecontractors that hired him as a consultant shortly after he lefthis Navy job in April 1987.   Grassley said the scandal results from an atmosphere caused by``a business-as-usual, good-old-boy network where people move fromthe Pentagon to cushy jobs in private industry and everybody looksout for their friends.''   Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn, interviewedon ABC-TV's ``This Week with David Brinkley,'' said the Reaganadministration concentrated too much on obtaining more money forthe Pentagon, without paying enough attention to how it was beingspent.   ``We had people being selected for their ideological beliefs,for their salesmanship, but not for good sound management. I thinkthe emphasis has been on salesmanship and getting the money and themanagement end of it has been the last of the list of priorities,''said Nunn, D-Ga.   His view was echoed by Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of theHouse Armed Services Committee, who also appeared on the ABC show.   ``The decisions in the Lehman Navy were really highlycentralized in a few people right around the secretary, JohnLehman, and he had a very strong view about people who were withhim and people who were against him. And some of the people whowere with him may be a little shady characters,'' Aspin said.</TEXT></DOC>
