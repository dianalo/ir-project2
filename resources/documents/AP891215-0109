Asked about this year's ceremony, Fitzwater asserted withouthesitation: ``Last night was the real thing.''   Bush lit the 35-foot national tree on Thursday night in personat a public outdoor ceremony on the Ellipse. During his eight yearsin office, Reagan stayed within the White House complex for theceremony, supposedly lighting the Christmas tree by remote control.   Fitzwater was pressed about speculation that the button Reaganpushed each year was not attached to anything, and that a NationalPark Service officer actually lit the tree from the site.   ``I think that's a question for Mark Weinberg,'' Fitzwater said,referring to the current press spokesman in Reagan's Californiaoffice.   However, Weinberg made it clear he didn't want to get intodetails of the situation.   ``All I know is when the president pushed the button, the treelighted up,'' Weinberg said in a telephone interview.</TEXT></DOC>
