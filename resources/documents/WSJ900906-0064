Kent Durr, the minister of trade, industry and tourism,had just arrived in Moscow last month when he heard a radiostation dedicate a song to his delegation. The disk jockeysaid the tall and tanned Mr. Durr, the first South Africancabinet minister ever to visit the Soviet Union, looked likea &quot;movie star.&quot; Until then, the Soviets had viewed thePretoria government as a cabal of ugly racists.</LP><TEXT>   A few days later, President F.W. de Klerk stepped off aplane in the African country of Madagascar and was greetedwith a banner newspaper headline screaming &quot;Welcome to You.&quot;His smiling face beamed from the front page. This was from acountry that routinely labeled South Africa the &quot;racistrepublic.&quot;   What's going on here? As the caption on Mr. de Klerk'spicture said, &quot;A whistlestop visit under the sign ofrealpolitik.&quot;   The realpolitik of desperately poor Africa is that if thecontinent is to have a chance at recovery it needs openeconomic ties with South Africa, the only high-tech, FirstWorld economy south of the Sahara. In Eastern Europe,realpolitik dictates that nations retooling their communisteconomies take help wherever they can get it.   For South Africa, long shunned by the world for itsrace-segregation policies, realpolitik means rejoining theinternational community through any door that opens, even ifit is via the two regions of the world, Africa and EasternEurope, that have been its fiercest critics. Pretoria beganshedding its pariah status earlier this year by embarking ona series of political reforms aimed at ending apartheid andwhite minority rule.   &quot;We may not smell of roses yet,&quot; says a South Africancabinet minister, &quot;but we are no longer the polecat of theworld.&quot;   In spite of trade and financial sanctions, commerce hasalways existed between South Africa and both Eastern Europeand black Africa. For instance, Polish vodka has always foundits way to South Africa, and South African wine has beenavailable in Poland, albeit under a disguised label. Thegoods either moved under the table or through a third party,which raised the costs to both sides. Now, this trade iscoming out of the closet.   &quot;For the first time in my life I'm not penalized for beinga white South African,&quot; says Frans Roelofse, a director ofHeadquarters Ltd., which earlier this year opened SouthAfrica's first export-import joint venture in Hungary. A fewmonths later it set up shop in Mozambique and will soon bedoing business in the Ivory Coast. &quot;In the past it's been sofrustrating,&quot; says Mr. Roelofse. &quot;We simply couldn't go hereor there.&quot;   East European traders feel the same sense of freedom.&quot;Communism is gone,&quot; says Stefan Mathews, the Polish-borndirector-general of the Polish-South African Chamber ofCommerce in Johannesburg. &quot;No more communists, so now you cantrade with whom you like.&quot;   As a result, South Africans are showing up in the mostunexpected places these days, and the most unexpected peopleare showing up here. In the past few months, Pretoria hasopened up official trade offices in Zaire and Hungary, and anunofficial one in Warsaw. While South African businessmenjuggle invitations from Mozambique and Gabon, tradedelegations from Romania, Bulgaria, Poland, Hungary andCzechoslovakia bump into one another in South Africa. EvenMiss Hungary came for a look.   Mr. Roelofse says South Africans and East Europeans, inparticular, make ideal, albeit strange, bedfellows. &quot;Both ofour peoples are tired of living in make-believe systems,where you're told to believe B when the reality is A,&quot; hesays. &quot;Now we just talk reality to each other. When we'redoing business, they don't say to me, `OK, first renounceapartheid and apologize for the past 40 years.' Likewise, I'mnot going to say to them, `You apologize for 40 years ofcommunism.'&quot;   Ironies abound. The Soviet Union, for instance, welcomedMr. Durr before receiving Nelson Mandela. The Soviets havebeen the biggest backer, both in money and weapons, of Mr.Mandela's African National Congress in its long fight totopple Pretoria's white minority government. Yet it was Mr.Durr, representing one of the world's most rabidlyanti-communist governments, who planted a fir tree near thesite of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster on behalf of thepeople of South Africa. Mr. Mandela, who has been circlingthe globe since being released in February from 27 years inprison, still hasn't stopped by Moscow.   &quot;We have been the poorer for not knowing each other,&quot; saidMr. Durr after his Soviet travels. &quot;We will both benefit andbe the richer by sharing our experience, culture and economicpotential.&quot;   Mr. de Klerk's Madasgascar trip was also laden with irony.Madagascar never missed a beat at Organization of AfricanUnity meetings when it came to denouncing Pretoria. But withhis economy deteriorating, and with political intrigue asthick as the island's tropical air, Madagascar PresidentDidier Ratsiraka made a nighttime phone call to Mr. de Klerk-- following the release of Mr. Mandela -- to talk aboutestablishing trade links.   &quot;When one is in politics you have to face reality,&quot; Mr.Ratsiraka said after entertaining his visitors from Pretoria.&quot;At one stage it was in the best interests of my country tobreak relations with South Africa. We now have commercial,economic and cultural relations with the new South Africabecause it is in the best interests of Madagascar.&quot;   Neither visit produced much in the way of immediate tradeor diplomatic ties. But for the South Africans, just gettinga foot in the door after all these years of being locked outis most important.   &quot;Our economic future lies in industry, and it must beexport-led,&quot; says Stefanus Naude, director-general ofPretoria's department of trade and industry.   The Polish-South African Chamber of Commerce is ready toshow the way. &quot;We just want to get on with business,&quot; saysMr. Mathews. On the wall behind his desk is a Polish flag,with a gold crown on the eagle's head, just as it was beforethe communists took over. The walls are decorated withpictures of Polish kings and princes.   Mr. Mathews produces a catalog of a Polish bicycle-maker.&quot;They're looking for agents here,&quot; he says. He rifles througha stack of business cards, Polish and South African, and saysthere is a potential deal attached to each one. He talksabout engineering more than $100 million in two-way tradethis year. Someone in Poland wants dried flowers, someonehere wants fishing nets. Warsaw wants fruit juice,Johannesburg wants shoes.   &quot;We want to give people what they want, not what they havebeen told to want,&quot; says Mr. Mathews. &quot;Simple things, foreveryday survival. Poles don't want guns or ammunition. Theywant fertilizer. South Africa has fertilizer. Perfect.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
