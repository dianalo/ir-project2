PAULSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A sheriff who came out against semiautomaticweapons found his fears borne out only hours later when a gunman cuta bloody path through his district, killing two people and woundingthree, including two deputies.   During Thursday's rampage by a man wielding a semiautomaticMAC-11 machine pistol, Arapahoe County Sheriff Pat Sullivan againlashed out at the sale of such weapons.   ``Our officers are out-gunned by these weapons of war. These gunsare designed to kill and maim people,'' he said.   He held up a blood-stained revolver one of his deputies had usedagainst Thursday's suspect, and said the deputy was totallyout-gunned.   Sullivan said the MAC-11 can hold 32 rounds and fire 10 timesfaster than the standard .38-caliber pistol issued to all deputysheriffs.   Deputies said 20-year-old Eugene Thompson Jr. went on a 12-hourrampage in which he abducted a woman, killed her and hermother-in-law, raped another woman, shot two police officers, shot ahostage in the back and then killed himself Thursday, ending 12hours of terror.   In his position paper issued Wednesday, Sullivan said, ``I am awestern Coloradan who enjoys big game hunting and I don't want tosee anything that would hurt sport hunting. But we have to dosomething about these weapons of war.''   Sullivan said laws should be tightened to control who can buysuch weapons, and if they can't be controlled, he urged the ColoradoLegislature to pass a law to ban their sale.   In his paper, Sullivan cited the January shooting in Stockton,Calif., in which five children were killed and 29 children and aschool teacher were wounded by a man carrying a copy of theChinese-made AK-47 semiautomatic rifle.   ``This tragic event has stimulated city, county, state andfederal legislative efforts to control or ban these weapons ofwar,'' Sullivan said.   The California Assembly has approved a ban on 40 types ofassault-type weapons, and similar bills are pending in other states.The Bush Administration temporarily has banned the import ofsemiautomatic assault rifles.   Sullivan's paper said that although the Constitution givescitizens the right to import, manufacture, sell and possesssemiautomatic weapons, there is also ``a burden to place somereasonable controls on these weapons of war without abridging thesportsman's right to legitimate sporting rifles.''   ``I do not propose their absolute ban, but simply to bring themunder the same or similar controls'' as machine guns, silencers,sawed-off rifles, sawed-off shotguns, anti-tank guns, bazookas,mortars, and caneguns, he said.   Included in his list of weapons to be restricted are the MAC-10and MAC-11, the gun used in Thursday's attacks.   Sullivan said recent raids in Arapahoe County have netted a fullyautomatic AK-47, a fully automatic MAC-10 with a silencer, an AR-15and a semi-automatic shotgun.</TEXT></DOC>
