The warning came as the Seoul government put riot police onnationwide alert to prepare for possible protests this week overthe student's death and the ninth anniversary of a bloody 1980anti-government uprising.   About 300 radical students calling for the overthrow ofPresident Roh Tae-woo battled riot police with firebombs and rocksat Sungkyunkwan University in Seoul. Troopers with interlockedshields blocked the school's main gate to stop students frommarching into the streets.   A Foreign Ministry official, who declined to be named in keepingwith official practice, said a U.S. State Department official'scomments on the death of radical student Lee Chol-kyu wereunacceptable and incorrect.   ``Unnecessary (American) comment on internal matters,particularly on a situation in which it does not know the truth,would not be of help to the U.S.-Korea alliance or friendlyrelations,'' the official said.   South Korean dissidents claim Lee was tortured and killed bypolice and reject a government autopsy report that he drowned. Thebody was found May 10 in a reservoir outside the southeastern cityof Kwangju.   South Korea protested to Washington after the State Departmentofficial last week called Lee's death ``a deplorable event. We donot know who may have committed this atrocious act.''   The official noted that Roh had called for a full investigationof the case ``and we hope the murderers will be exposed andseverely punished.''   South Korea lodged a protest in Washington over the statement,contending it had not been proved that Lee was murdered. The StateDepartment said Monday it did not intend to prejudge how Lee waskilled.   The Foreign Ministry said today that it accepted the StateDepartment's Monday comment as ``a practical correction'' of thereference to ``murderers'' even though it was not specificallyretracted by the department.   South Korea and the United States are close allies and about43,000 U.S. troops are based in South Korea under a mutual defensetreaty.   Thousands of people have held daily protests in Kwangju todenounce police as being responsible for Lee's death. Clashes havebroken out between protesters trying to march to provincialgovernment headquarters and truncheon-wielding troopers.   South Korea has been hit by a wave of violent protests and laborstrikes in recent months. Dissident groups are caling for theoverthrow of Roh, but they lack public support because of theirviolent tactics and extreme views.   Dissidents and radical students are trying to harness thegrowing furor over Lee's death to step up a campaign to topple thegovernment. Dissidents call for the expulsion of U.S. forces.   Authorities fear the dispute over Lee's death could inflameprotests this week to mark the anniversary of a 1980 uprising inKwangju in which at least 192 people were killed. Dissidents havecalled for nationwide demonstrations.   National Police Headquarters in Seoul said riot police had beenplaced on nationwide alert to prevent violent protests. Securitywas being increased at government buildings to prevent possiblestudent attacks, officials said.   The opposition-controlled National Assembly convened 16committees today to investigate Lee's death, the Kwangju uprisingand other issues. Opposition parties contend the government isusing radical violence as a pretext to crack down on all oppositiongroups.   President Roh said today that the government was making everyeffort to find out how Lee died. He said the dissidents' efforts toplay up the incident were a threat to political stability anddemocracy.   At the time of Lee's deasth, police had been hting for himbecause of his anti-government activities, including writingarticles praising communist North Korea. Authorities say policestopped Lee in a taxi near Kwangju, but he escaped on foot.   Police officials say Lee probably fell into the reservoir whilefleeing police and drowned.   Dissident groups claim the government investigation into Lee'sdeath was a coverup and are demanding an independent probe byAmnesty International or the World Christian Council.</TEXT></DOC>
