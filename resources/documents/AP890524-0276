The ministerial council of the 13-nation Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries holds its biannual meeting June 5 inVienna to consider production and pricing policy for the July toDecember period.   The cartel's 18.5 million barrel-per-day production ceiling forthe first six months of the year has been largely responsible forarresting a downslide in prices and raising them beyond OPEC'stargeted $18 price.   At times, the price has overshot that level by $2 to $3, thoughoil industry analysts also attribute this hike to major oilaccidents in the North Sea and Alaska.   Lukman, who is also Nigeria's oil minister, referred to demandby some OPEC members for an increase in the overall quota betweenone and 1.5 million barrels per day.   ``We want a moderate and gradual increase in prices, not asudden one, and we therefore have to study the market to decide onthe best production level for the second half of the year,'' hesaid.   Lukman said that OPEC should have a ``moving ceiling'' which itcan raise or lower to maintain the price levels it sought.   But he also noted that in case output had to be considerablyhiked, it would only be the OPEC member states with high reservesand production capability that could accommodate such demand. Helisted in this respect Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United ArabEmirates, Iraq and Iran.   Producers outside the cartel could harm the OPEC price system ifthey did not cooperate on output levels, he said.   ``We definitely need assurances from them that they willcooperate with us and work together with us, not doing anythingthat would harm the market,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
