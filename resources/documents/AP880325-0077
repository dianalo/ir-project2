Mohamed Mouhajer, who was arrested last March in a police sweep,was freed Thursday by magistrate Gilles Boulouque, according to asource in the magistrate's office. Seven Tunisians also werearrested in the sweep.   Mouhajer was released ``because there was not sufficientevidence to keep him in temporary detention'' any longer, accordingto the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.   Boulouque has been in charge of investigating a series of Parisbombings in 1985 and 1986 that left 13 people dead and 250 injured.   French authorities have said Mouhajer, a former philosophystudent at the Sorbonne, was an ideologist for the Committee forSolidarity with Arab and Middle East Political Prisoners, a groupwhich claimed responsiblity for five of the violent attacks.   The source said Mouhajer was held while police investigated hisrelationship with Fouad Ali Saleh, a Tunisian immigrant describedby authorities at the time of his arrest as the leader of apro-Iranian terrorist network. Saleh has been charged in several ofthe bombings, including a Sept. 17, 1986, attack at the Tatidepartment store that killed six people and injured 51 others.   Mouhajer still faces charges of criminal association and illegalpossession of arms and has been forbidden to leave the country.Neither charge is related to the terrorist bombings, the sourcesaid.   A French newspaper today implied that Mouhajer's release mightbe connected to Conservative Premier Jacques Chirac's hopes for theupcoming presidential election. Four Frenchmen are missing andbelieved to be held captive in Lebanon.   The daily Liberation said, ``In this electoral period, JacquesChirac would not be displeased with the release of some Frenchhostages in Lebanon.''   Earlier this week, Jacques Kosciusko-Morizet, national secretaryof Chirac's party, the Rally for the Republic, visited Damascuswhere he met with a number of Syrian officials.   Syria is the main powerbroker in Lebanon and maintains troops inwest Beirut.   On his return to Paris, Kosciusko-Morizet told the French newsagency Agence France-Presse that the meetings were not related tothe French hostages in Lebanon.   In all 22 foreigners are missing and believed to be held captivein Lebanon. The longest held hostage is Terry Anderson, chiefMiddle East correspondent for The Associated Press, who waskidnapped March 16, 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
