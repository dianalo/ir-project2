It was the index's second-largest rise this year.   The recovery in Tokyo led to rallies on stock markets in otherAsian cities, some of which had plunged on Monday after the DowJones industrial average fell by more than 190 points, or 6.9percent, on Friday.   Today, Tokyo's Nikkei Stock Average jumped by 527.39 points, or1.53 percent, to 34,996.08. It had fallen 647.33 points on Monday.   Traders said today's volume was a moderate 650 million shares,up from Monday's thin 520 million.   Analysts said investors were encouraged by the recovery on WallStreet and statements by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspanthat the U.S. central bank would intervene to prevent a crash.   Japanese Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto repeated remarks hemade Monday that he wasn't seriously concerned about the impact ofFriday's plunge in New York on Japanese markets.   ``I don't think markets moved that sharply (this time),'' hetold a news conference after a regular Cabinet meeting today.   But Haruhito Ichimura, a trader with Nippon Kangyo KakumaruSecurities, warned that it was too early to tell whether the NewYork market had completely recovered from its fall.   On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, the dollar closed at142.25 yen, up 1.50 yen from Monday's close of 140.75 yen. Itopened at 141.97 yen and ranged between 141.80 and 142.35 yen. Thedollar had plunged 3.25 yen on Monday.   Mitsuhiko Kinugasa, a dealer with Daiwa Bank, said there hadbeen rumors that Japanese banks again were backing away from arevised plan for financing a buyout of United Airlines' parentcompany. The refusal of banks, mostly Japanese, to commit theirfunds to a similar plan last week led to Friday's plunge on WallStreet.   But Kinugasa said the rumors did not have a major impact on themarket.   Elsewhere in Asia today, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index, themarket's key indicator of blue chips, was by midday up 3.6 percentfrom its close Monday, when it plunged 6.5 percent.   Share prices on the Securities Exchange of Thailand alsorebounded strongly after a record 42-point fall on Monday.   In Manila, share prices closed 0.87 percent higher in moderatetrading, and prices on the Taiwan stock exchange posted the largestone-day gain ever on news of the rapid recoveries of the New Yorkand Tokyo markets.   The 410.32-point gain in Taiwan _ 4.23 percent _ followed a dropof 329.48 points on Monday.   ``The recovery on Wall Street relieves worries over a worldwidecrash and draws bargain-hunters,'' said one Taiwan broker, whospoke on condition of anonymity.
