In a wide-ranging address to the United Nations General Assembly, Mr. Reagan criticized Tehran for failing to accept a U.N. cease-fire resolution. He called for sanctions unless Iranian President Ali Khamenei agrees to the cease-fire in a speech he is scheduled to deliver to the world body today.    &quot;If the answer is positive, it would be a welcome step and major breakthrough,&quot; Mr. Reagan said, referring to Mr. Khamenei's speech. &quot;If it is negative, the (U.N. Security) Council has no choice but rapidly to adopt enforcement measures.&quot;    Laying out his personal world &quot;vision&quot; in his U.N. speech, Mr. Reagan also expressed hopes for further arms accords with the Soviet Union, but he also reiterated some of his standard criticism of the Soviets. However, he saved his harshest words for Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista regime, warning that he won't be satisfied with &quot;phony&quot; moves toward democracy in Nicaragua.    The Reagan administration has said previously that it would seek sanctions against Iran unless the country agrees to a cease-fire. Mr. Reagan's reiteration of that position seemed designed to step up pressure on Iran. The president spoke before receiving word of the attack by American helicopters on an Iranian vessel that allegedly was planting mines in the Persian Gulf. White House officials said Mr. Reagan learned of the attack late yesterday afternoon while returning to Washington from New York.    U.S. officials said they are cautiously optimistic that the U.N. Security Council will approve a resolution calling for a halt to arms sales to either Iran or Iraq if they refuse to accept the cease-fire. But in the past, the Soviet Union, which is trying to maintain good relations with Iran, and China, which is believed to have sold arms to Iran, have been reluctant to support such a measure.    Concerning the Soviets, Mr. Reagan pledged in his speech to &quot;continue to pursue the goal of arms reduction&quot; and stressed that he will seek a 50% cut in the superpowers' arsenals of strategic, or intercontinental, nuclear weapons. American officials think that, in the wake of last week's agreement in principle to eliminate intermediate-range nuclear arms, it may be possible to negotiate such a cut in strategic arms before Mr. Reagan leaves office.    But Mr. Reagan delivered a low-key warning that he doesn't intend to back away from his plans for a space-based missile defense to pave the way for a strategic arms accord. The president maintained that his so-called Strategic Defense Initiative &quot;has greatly enhanced the prospects for real arms reduction,&quot; and he added, &quot;It is a crucial part of our efforts to ensure a safer world and a more stable strategic balance.&quot;    Mr. Reagan suggested that the new spirit of U.S.-Soviet cooperation hasn't led him to abandon his longstanding suspicions of the Soviets. He called on Moscow to set a date for withdrawal of their troops from Afghanistan and said the Afghan resistance &quot;grows in strength&quot; daily.    He again called on the Soviet Union to release more information about its military forces and allow its citizens more freedom of movement. But he didn't phrase his criticism as harshly as he has in past years, and he said that the U.S. is &quot;intensely interested&quot; in recent steps toward political liberalization in the Soviet Union.    Mr. Reagan wasn't so muted in his criticism of Nicaragua. In one of the most detailed passages of his speech, Mr. Reagan spelled out five broad steps he wants the Sandinista government to take to show that it is moving toward democracy as called for in a new Central American peace plan. He said Nicaragua's leaders must &quot;shut down the military machine that threatens your neighbors,&quot; open up internal political activity, hold free national elections, allow a &quot;truly free&quot; press and let exiles return to the country.    If this process doesn't take place in Nicaragua, &quot;democratization will be a fraud,&quot; Mr. Reagan said. &quot;And until it happens, we will press for true democracy by supporting those fighting for it.&quot; Mr. Reagan didn't mention the Contra rebels by name, but his statement was a clear signal that he intends to fight for more aid for the insurgents battling the government in Managua unless broad changes take place quickly in Nicaragua.    Later, Mr. Reagan met with Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, who said Japan is studying &quot;a wide range&quot; of steps it can take soon to help the U.S. protect tankers carrying oil out of the Persian Gulf. Japan is heavily dependent on oil from the gulf, but hasn't aided the U.S. naval task force protecting the tankers.    Under the Japanese Constitution, the Tokyo government would be forbidden from sending any military forces to the gulf. But U.S. officials said Japan is considering helping to pay for the naval escorts. </TEXT></DOC>
