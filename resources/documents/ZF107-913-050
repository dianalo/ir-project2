(differing font software imaging models) (column)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Seymour, Jim.andM;</AUTHOR><SUMMARY>Scalable outline fonts are gaining acceptance among microcomputerusers, but at the expense of good will among the softwarepublishers.andP;  Microsoft Corp, Apple, Next Inc, IBM and AdobeSystems Inc are the leaders in the font market.andP;  Microsoft andApple have a licensing agreement for a PostScript clone that hasupset the balance among the five companies.andP;  The dispute amongthem could result in a lack of development in scalable fonttechnology because licenses will not be available to all thecompanies that want to build the technology into their operatingenvironments.andP;  Apple's product using Microsoft's technology willnot be available until mid-1990 at the earliest.andP;  It promises tohave built-in outlines that will be compatible with PostScriptfonts, and other type vendors' fonts as well.andP;  In the near future,WYSIWYG fonts may only be available for high-end OS/2 systems.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Imaging TechnologyFontsStandardization.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Jim Seymour Last time, we looked at how a crisis over disparate imagingmodels has been splitting the personal computer industry--and hammering theusers.andP;  Because the ragged evolution of personal computers has allowed thedevelopment of many divergent schemes for representing how text will appearon-screen and on paper, we're still far from a WYSIWYG world.andM;When a given computer uses two different imaging models--one to send arepresentation of the final output to the screen, a second to send the actualoutput to a printer--errors are inevitable.andP;  While this was acceptable whenwe lived in a world of character-oriented displays and daisy wheel and dotmatrix printers, it is clearly unacceptable in today's era of high-resolutiongraphics displays and laser printers--particularly with todayhs graphicalapplications, which demand far greater accuracy.andM;Apple's decision last May to build its own system of scalable outline fontsinto the Macintosh operating system, in effect dropping its reliance onPostScript, should solve this dilemma for Mac users.andP;  In this scheme, thesame font outlines would be used both for drawing to the screen and fordrawing to a connected printer.andP;  And this would provide, at least in theory,an ideal 1:1 correspondence between display and printed output.andM;But what about PC users?andP;  Laser printers using Adobe's PostScript interpreterhave drawn good support among DOS applications software vendors.andP;  But thatonly covers the printed-output half of the equation.andP;  And Display PostScriptis dead in the water as a screen-imaging model in the PC world, for thereasons I traced in last issue's column.andM;Apple and Microsoft dropped The Big Bomb at Jonathan Seybold's desktoppublishing conference in late September.andP;  There, Microsoft announced that itwould license Apple's scalable-font technology--the same technology goinginto the Macintosh's System 7.0 operating system next year--for subsequentversions of OS/2 Presentation Manager.andM;This would let Microsoft build a tight linkage between its own, existingscreen-imaging model for Presentation Manager and Apple's scalable fonts.andO;Consequently, users of OS/2 Presentation Manager could be assured that theirprinted output would match the screen image very closely.andP;  And printer makerswould be able to build a single model--also based on Apple's fonttechnology--that would work equally well with Macintoshes and PCs runningPresentation Manager.andM;Earlier this year, Microsoft bought the rights to a PostScript clonedeveloped by Bauer Enterprises, and it has cross-licensed that technology toApple.andP;  This no doubt makes Apple a lot more comfortable, after its rupturewith its former ally, long-time supplier and once partly owned...AdobeSystems.andM;WHEN ELEPHANTS FIGHTandM;At Seybold's conference, a nasty dust-up broke out among Microsoft, Adobe,NeXT, and (implicitly) Apple.andP;  Microsoft's chairman Bill Gates began theprogram one morning by fleshing out the details of the Apple-Microsoft dealannounced the night before.andM;Then Adobe founder John Warnock, sitting on the dais next to Gates, calledhis plans &quot;the biggest bunch of garbage and mumbo-jumbo I've ever heard.&quot;andO;Things went downhill from there: Steve Jobs of NeXT, the sole licensee ofWarnock's Display PostScript, was on the dais too and sided, predictably,with Adobe.andM;Normally this would be only so much soap opera--messier than we're used tobut not very important.andP;  In practice, though, these four companies, plus IBM,hold the keys to the kinds of imaging models that will dominate personalcomputing for the next decade.andP;  So these angry words are more than unseemly:they're tragic.andP;  You and I are the real losers in the game of up-yours thesefive are playing.andM;What about PC users who aren't interested in OS/2 and its PresentationManager interface, but who want high-quality scalable fonts built into theiroperating environment for use in such type-critical programs as PageMaker?andO;Will that integral scalable-font technology also appear in Microsoft Windows,the graphical environment for determined DOS users?andM;Peter Neupert, head of OS/2 development at Microsoft, tells me that squeezingthat technology into Windows will be tough.andP;  &quot;One of our design goals forWindows is to keep it under 1 megabyte,&quot; Neupert says.andP;  &quot;Bill [Gates] hassaid we're going to do these scalable fonts in Presentation Manager first,and we are.andP;  You'll see them in PM, then we'll see about Windows.&quot;andP;  Doesn'tsound very hopeful.andM;NOT FOR THE REST OF USandM;When will the first fruits of this curious Apple-Microsoft alliance appear ondealers' shelves?andP;  &quot;We've announced our first 32-bit version of OS/2 formid-1990,&quot; Neupert says.andP;  &quot;I don't think there's any chance you'll see thefonts in OS/2 before then.andP;  Whether we can move Apple's code into the productin time for that first 32-bit release we still don't know.&quot;andM;The prospect of built-in font outlines--outlines, Apple promises, that willbe compatible with PostScript fonts and with fonts from Bitstream, ITC,Linotype, Monotype, URW, AGFA, Compugraphic, and other major type vendors-isvastly appealing.andP;  But remember that the Microsoft move still doesn't heraldan era with a single, universal imaging model--only one with two very closelyrelated models.andP;  Whether close is good enoughfor the '90s remains to be seen.andM;The implications for PC users?andP;  It's going to be messy.andP;  It will take atleast two years Neupert believes, before the imaging-model crisis will beginto be sorted out on PCs--and then, I'd guess, only for users of high-endsystems running OS/2 Presentation Manager.andP;  For the rest of us, WYSIWYG inthe PC world will remain an alluring but distant dream.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
