The FDA ban, which is effective Sept. 10, was ordered by the U.S. District Court here after a suit was brought by the Public Citizen Health Research Group. An FDA official said this is one of the few times the agency has banned an entire food category.    Raw milk doesn't undergo the pasteurization process and therefore may contain harmful bacteria. Advocates of raw milk counter that pasteurization kills some nutrients.    Though there is currently very little interstate sale of raw milk, government officials and representatives of health organizations have said that the federal move may encourage states to ban intrastate sales of the product or to enforce existing bans more strongly.    The suit was provoked in part by a long-running battle between one of the country's largest distributors of the product, Alta-Dena Certified Dairy, City of Industry, Calif., and regulators and health groups. A spokeswoman for Alta-Dena said yesterday that the company has had little interstate raw-milk business, and that the ban won't affect its sales. </TEXT></DOC>
