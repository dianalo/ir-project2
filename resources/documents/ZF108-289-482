 When he needs acertain document or file, it only takes a second for him to locate it on adesk that is missing any sign of clutter.andP;  His data center is maintained muchthe same way as his personal area: controlled, organized and efficient.andM;Hallmark, based in Kansas City, Mo., was founded 80 years ago.andP;  Today, thecompany has 15,000 employees and holds almost half the greeting card market.andM;To support an organization that manufactures some 11 million cards perday--some produced within earshot of Johnson's office, Hallmark has an IBM3090 model 600E, an Amdahl 5990 and a newly installed Teradata databaseengine.andP;  The data center, with 140 employees, has 600 gigabytes of diskstorage, 3,200 terminals and 36 tape drives to support nearly 2.5 milliontransactions a day.andM;Although the privately held company's dual-mainframe data center is smallcompared to those of other major U.S.andP;  corporations, the environment is atleast as complex as those with more processors, Johnson said.andM;Because the greeting card manufacturer is running both VM and MVS/XAoperating systems, 21 CICS regions, TSO and 75 independent software packageson a wide variety of applications spread across the two machines, Johnsonsaid evaluation of new technology with a healthy dose of common sense isimportant.andM;Johnson seeks innovative solutions from his staff and gets suggestionsconstantly.andP;  &quot;Every month when I get the operating report, I hear ideas frommy staff that are innovative and suggest new ways of doing things better,&quot; hesaid.andP;  &quot;I don't know how common that is at other companies, but I think it isprobably uncommon.&quot;andM;Some ideas suggested to Johnson are tried and others scrapped.andP;  In at leastseveral cases, new technology was tested and put aside when the solution wasfound to be more trouble than it was worth.andP;  In another instance, anuts-and-bolts solution was implemented where a different manager might havefound a more expensive route.andP;  Johnson said technology for technology's sakeis to be avoided.andM;Johnson said he is always interested in new technology, but approving its useis another matter.andP;  He pointed out his decision regarding console automationsoftware as a good example of his prudence.andM;Console operators were dealing with more messages than necessary.andP;  SoHallmark decided to implement a degree of automated operations through IBM'sNetview and OPS/MVS, a software package from Goal Systems International,Columbus, Ohio.andM;The effort resulted in the successful repression of over 90% of consolemessages.andP;  But what really sold Johnson on the Goal package was the beliefthat a PC-based information processing language (IPL) generator would providea productivity boost.andM;However, six months after bringing in the PC component and spending a fairamount of time configuring it, Johnson decided to scrap the restart system.andO;He and his staff determined that it would take more time to maintain the PCsoftware than the five minutes shaved off an IPL when it was automated.andM;&quot;Part of our justification for the package was the automated IPL ability.andO;But when our people were nearly done configuring and testing it, we found itwasn't really worth the time to keep it current,&quot; Johnson said.andM;He noted that the time spent evaluating the feature was less than the cost ofthe PC software.andM;TAPE VAULTING SOLUTIONandM;Johnson's common-sense approach paid off when one of his data center managersproposed a simple solution to a problem with off-site storage of 3480 tapecartridges.andP;  About 900 cartridges are handled-pulled each day, carted to anoff-site vault and stored.andM;&quot;There's an awful lot of room for error in that process and we averaged onewrong each day,&quot; Johnson said.andP;  &quot;We could have gone to an electronic vaultingsystem that could have resulted in a half million dollar investment.&quot;andM;Ed Crisman, a data center manager, suggested the use of a programmable barcode reader to ensure that tapes are correctly pulled.andP;  Johnson, aware thatHallmark had staff familiar with programming the portable machines for orderprocessing operations, gave Crisman the go-ahead.andM;Six months and $12,000 later, operations staffers were using the scanners thabeeped when the tape failed to match a downloaded pull list.andP;  Hallmark isstill evaluating a more to electronic vaulting, but the newly implemented barcode readers provide an accurate, if only temporary, safeguard.andP;  Crismansaid, &quot;Of the tapes going to our vault each day, about half are handledtwice.andP;  It can be a big problem managing that but this system will give usproper controls.&quot;andM;But, Johnson recalled, it was not all easy.andP;  &quot;I personally wasn't sure wewould get this thing done because we kept having problems with the labels.andO;Where we wanted to stick the labels they kept coming off and wearing out.&quot;andM;Falling back on its expertise in label-making, Hallmark produced a bar codelabel with two times the normal amount of glue, Johnson said.andM;It is the Hallmark data center staff, along with the support of John Collins,information systems vice president, whom Johnson credits with succesfuloperations management.andM;&quot;We attract and keep competent people and that is indicative of the wholecompany,&quot; said the 18-year Hallmark veteran.andM;He noted that Hallmark has been rated one of the nation's best-runcorporations.andP;  His midlevel managers have typically been at the company formore than a dozen years each.andM;Johnson, who moved to operations from applications development several yearsago, explained two organizational changes made to help stream-line the datacenter.andM;In early 1987, the data center management eliminated a system in whichoperators rotated between console, report distribution and microfilm duties.andO;That change resulted in 10 fewer positions and created a larger set ofexperienced console operators.andM;Two years later, the console and network operations staffs were combined toprovide what Johnson calls &quot;critical mass.&quot;andP;  He said that the larger,combined staff not only has more varied duties but also is more flexible interms of scheduling requirements such as sick leave and vacation time.andM;A MODEL MEETING STRUCTUREandM;Johnson emphasized the need for structure in data center operations.andO;Anything unplanned or undocumented is unwelcome.andP;  He insists that vendors,particularly those whose products are problematic or mission-critical, attendweekly meetings.andM;&quot;It hasn't really been a problem getting vendors to attend because of ourprocedures.andP;  The time is fixed, attendance is noted and it's usually the samegroup of people.andP;  It's also very important to publish the notes in a timelymanner, preferably by the next day,&quot; he said.andP;  The vendors are told aboutproblems or upcoming changes.andM;A second meeting, held daily, keeps close tabs on day-to-day operations.andP;  The15-minute meeting at 8 a.m.andP;  includes the vice president of informationsystems and six top information center managers: the director of systemsdevelopment, the director of the information technology center, the databaseadministrator, the security administrator, a subsidiary operations managerand Johnson.andM;CHANGE CONTROLandM;The attendees discuss operations of the last 24 hours, including growingresponse times.andP;  Change control and reporting on how performance compared toservice-level objectives are paramount to the success of the Hallmarkinformation center and thus the company, Johnson said.andM;The data center staff keeps critical statistics that go into four reports.andO;The first is a pass completion report that lists scheduled versus actualcompletion times for critical passes, online files and report runs, withcritical corporate activities noted.andP;  An unusual conditions report might showoccurrences such as a high volume of orders processed.andM;The unusual system occurrences report logs other significant problems and anetwork daily status report might show a modem failure.andP;  Other statisticsgathered include microfilm output, reports printed, batch volume, reruns andIPL comparisons.andM;&quot;Our philosophy is to monitor and measure the things we think are importantto our success.andP;  But everybody has to understand what is important.andP;  We alsotry to publish any statistics and not keep them secret.andP;  That's vital,&quot;Johnson said.andM;If a problem is detected in the information systems staff, the personresponsible may hear that noted in a performance report, Johnson said.andP;  If avendor is falling down on the job, &quot;They either improve their performance orwe find another vendor.&quot;andM;Documentation is equally important in the Hallmark data center.andP;  &quot;We reallydon't like to have people carry things in their heads only.andP;  If they're goingto do something more than one time, we want it written down,&quot; Johnson said.andO;&quot;I think we do a very good job at that and it is constantly paying off forus.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
