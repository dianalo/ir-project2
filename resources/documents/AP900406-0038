Military armor and patrols filled the streets Thursday morningminutes after the bomb was found.   Interior Minister Horacio Serpa, who police said walked by thetruck minutes before the bomb was found Thursday, called anemergency meeting of the National Security Council. He is actingpresident while President Virgilio Barco is in Europe on a statevisit.   Federal Sen. Federico Estrada, 63, who was kidnapped by drugtraffickers Tuesday in Medellin, was released unharmed Thursday inthat northwestern Colombian city, home of Medellin's cocaine cartel.   The traffickers had threatened to murder him if police did notrelease four of their associates. Police have denied detaining thefour, and the reason for Estrada's being freed was not clear.   Police said gunmen working for drug traffickers killed anotherpoliceman Thursday in Medellin, bringing to 15 the number ofofficers killed there since Monday.   The city's police chief, Col. Carlos Alberto Otalora, sayscocaine lords are paying $4,300 for each slaying of an officer.   There has been a surge of violence since last week, when thegovernment extradited another drug suspect to the United States.Drug lords said at the time they would kill police officers andexplode a bomb in a wealthy section of Bogota in retaliation.   Most of the violence has been in Medellin, and police onThursday sent 600 reinforcements to the city to try to stop thebloodshed.   Police officers patrolling a main avenue in northern BogotaThursday morning saw two men hastily abandon a truck with its motorrunning.   In the back of the truck police found about 1,100 pounds ofdynamite buried under a load of toilet paper and hand soap, apolice lieutenant on the scene said.   The lieutenant, who spoke on condition of anonymity, saidSerpa's apartment is 1{ blocks from the site and that the interiorminister passed by the truck minutes before police discovered thebomb.   ``If the bomb had gone off, it would have wiped out two squareblocks,'' he said.   Two private schools with a total of 2,000 pupils are within twoblocks of the site.   Other major figures live in the neighborhood of luxuryhigh-rises, embassies and consulates, including former PresidentAlfonso Lopez Michelsen, presidential candidate Cesar Gaviria andthe chief of Colombia's secret police, Gen. Miguel Maza Marquez.   In one of several attempts to kill Maza, traffickers lastDecember exploded a 1,100-pound truck bomb at the secret police'sBogota headquarters. The blast killed 63 people.   The attack was part of the terrorist campaign meant to force thegovernment to abandon its policy of extraditing drug traffickers.   Barco revived the policy in August as part of a U.S.-backedcrackdown after drug traffickers killed a leading presidentialcandidate.   Bombings and other terrorist actions ended in January when thedrug lords declared a truce, but they announced last week they wereresuming their campaign when the government extradited another drugsuspect.</TEXT></DOC>
