On other markets Wednesday, energy futures posted strong gains onsigns of renewed tensions between Iran and Iraq; precious metalsretreated; copper futures fell; and livestock and meat futuresfinished mostly lower.   Grain futures followed soybeans lower on the Chicago Board ofTrade. Wheat settled 1} cents to 4 cents lower with March at $4.30 abushel; corn was } cent to 2} cents lower with March at $2.75{ abushel; oats were 2{ cents to 5 cents lower with March at $2.05 abushel; soybeans were 5 cents to 10} cents lower with March at$7.55{ a bushel.   Soybean growers in Brazil, the world's second-largest producerafter the United States, are preparing to harvest their largest cropever.   The movement of Brazilian _ and then Argentine _ soybeans intothe global pipeline will help ease the supply tightness that hascontributed to the market's recent firm tone.   The Agriculture Department has estimated Brazil's 1988-89 soybeancrop at 20 million metric tons compared with 17.8 million theprevious year. On Wednesday, a widely watched private weatherservice raised its Brazilian soybean estimate to 20.7 million metrictons from 19.6 million.   ``I think the real question is not whether it's going to be arecord crop, but how much of a record,'' said Ted Mao, a grainspecialist with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.   U.S. soybean growers harvested 1.54 billion bushels last year, orabout 41 million metric tons.   Mao said said a rise in soybean prices over the past 10 days hadprompted more selling of stockpiled beans by U.S. producers.   Oil futures rallied on the New York Mercantile Exchange followinga report that Iran's United Nations ambassador had accused Iraqisoldiers of killing five Iranian soldiers on Feb. 17.   The incident would mark the bloodiest clash between the MiddleEastern nations since the beginning of their 7-month cease-fire.   The energy market's rally also was seen as partly a reaction toTuesday's weekly American Petroleum Institute report, which showeddeclines in U.S. stocks of gasoline and distillates, althoughcrude-oil supplies increased.   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 24 cents to 45 centshigher with April at $18.54 a barrel; heating oil was .29 cent to.97 cent higher with April at 51.37 cents a gallon; unleadedgasoline was .44 cent to .83 cent higher with April at 51.85 cents agallon.   Gold and silver futures retreated on New York's CommodityExchange, selling off late in the session after gold for Aprildelivery encountered resistance at $398.80 a troy ounce.   Bernard Savaiko, a metals analyst with PaineWebber Inc. in NewYork, said April gold's failure to close above $396 an ounceindicated ``the recent rally is tiring.''   Gold settled 30 cents to 60 cents lower with April at $395.40 anounce; silver was 1.2 cents to 1.8 cents lower with May at $5.947 atroy ounce.   Copper futures also finished lower on the Commodity Exchangeafter initially rising. Analysts said the decline reflectedperceptions that physical demand for copper has slowed with themetal's rise in price during the past month.   Copper settled 2.9 cents to 4.1 cents lower with May at $1.404 apound.   Weakening cash markets contributed to a late slump in cattlefutures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Most pork futuresretreated on ideas that Wednesday's increase in hog marketings wouldresult in lower cash prices on Thursday.   Live cattle finished .25 cent to .45 cent lower with April at77.12 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .40 cent lower to .03 centhigher with March at 81.65 cents a pound; live hogs were .20 centlower to .08 cent higher with April at 44.10 cents a pound; frozenpork bellies were .25 cent lower to .12 cent higher with March at38.85 cents a pound.</TEXT></DOC>
