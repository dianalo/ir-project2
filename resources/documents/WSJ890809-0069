The additional $4 per share, for 15.2 million shares, was part of an agreement reached when Amax bought back the stock on May 20, 1988. The original price was $23 a share, or $349 million.    Under the agreement, Chevron held a one-time right, exercisable within two years of the buy-back, to receive an additional payment per share. If Amax's shares rose above $23, up to $28, Chevron could receive the excess per share.    Amax, a Greenwich, Conn., metals and energy company, said third-quarter earnings will reflect the difference between the value assigned on the original purchase date and the final amount, or about $41.7 million.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Amax shares closed $27.50, up 50 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
