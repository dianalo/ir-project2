In principle, the proposal won the endorsement of PresidentBush, who called on the Palestinians and the Arab states onThursday to ``think creatively'' along with Israel about ways topromote peace in the Middle East.   The president also offered the good offices of the United States``to move the peace process forward.''   So even though Secretary of State James A. Baker III is notpacking his bags yet, and Bush's support for the election ofPalestinian leaders is qualified, the administration can expect tobe critically involved in the explosive situation for theindefinite future.   Israel looks to the United States for support, and the Arabslook for leverage from Washington on Israel. So theadministration's involvement was probably inevitable in any event.   Strategically, Bush and Baker are pursuing a gradual approach,but they are also beginning to make their views clear to theparties.   They want Israel and the Arabs to negotiate directly with eachother. Therefore, they support a Middle East peace conference onlyif it will not get in the way of direct negotiations.   The United States will keep talking to the Palestine LiberationOrganization, despite Israel's protests, using the dialogue to tryto lower tensions on the West Bank and Gaza.   Last month, Baker suggested while testifying to a Housesubcommittee that maybe Israel should talk to the PLO in order tohave ``meaningful'' negotiations over the Palestinian issue. Hepulled back later, but the idea is still out there and could comeup again.   On Monday, Bush declared in the presence of visiting EgyptianPresident Hosni Mubarak that Israel's occupation of the West Bankand Gaza must come to an end.   On Thursday, with Shamir at his side, the president got eventougher on Israel. He said he had told the prime minister ``we donot support an independent Palestinian state, nor Israelisovereignty or permanent occupation of the West Bank and Gaza.''   The first point is shaded in Israel's favor. Shamir reiteratedduring his visit that a Palestinian state would pose anunacceptable danger to Israel.   The other two points are sweet music to the Arabs, who demand atotal withdrawal from the lands Israel captured during the 1967Six-Day war.   Previous U.S. presidents have said an overall settlement shouldinvolve land-for-peace. That meant Israel should give up territoryin exchange for Arab recognition.   Bush this week seemed to be taking the U.S. position a couple ofdecisive steps further. His statements might preclude Israelretaining any of the territory.   If the two sides ever get to the peace table the issues ofPalestinian statehood and Israeli sovereignty will be hotlycontested. Bush's statement is advance notice to Arabs and Israelishow the United States is likely to come down on these points.   But, in the meantime, Shamir's proposal to hold elections amongthe Palestinians is controversial enough to keep everyone,including the United States, busy.   There are lots of questions to be answered.   When would the election be held? How would it be supervised?And, most important of all, will Palestinians accept Shamir'sinvitation?   Shamir said at a news conference Thursday the election should beheld in a calm atmosphere. He would like the Palestinians tosuspend their revolt. But the continuing uprising in theterritories may be their strongest card.   Shamir also said international supervision of the ballotingwould not be necessary. He said Israelis and Palestinians wouldoversee the election, and that it would be held within Israel'sdemocratic traditions.   Will the Palestinians participate? Shamir said he thought theywould, despite the PLO's objections. That remains to be seen.   Unfazed at the end of a trying day, Baker said he still feltencouraged.   ``There will be a number of specific questions with respect towhich there will be differences of opinion,'' he told reporters.   But, he said, Shamir's election proposal ``affords anopportunity for a process to begin _ something, if I may say so,that we did not have before.''</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Barry Schweid covers U.S. diplomacy in theMiddle East for The Associated Press.</TEXT></DOC>
