Mrs. Aquino also said her government's position in talks on anew lease for U.S. bases has not been compromised by the role U.S.warplanes played in helping put down the rebellion that officialssay killed 113 people.   Military officials said they cannot account for more than halfof the soldiers who launched the coup attempt Dec. 1 in the mostserious bid by troops to topple Mrs. Aquino. Rebels in Cebu Citysurrendered their last known position to government forces Saturday.   Brig. Gen. Oscar Florendo, chief of the military's CivilRelations Service, said 1,485 rebel troops, including 128 officers,have surrendered. The military estimates about 3,000 soldiersjoined the coup attempt, and the whereabouts of many rebelsremained unclear.   Florendo said in addition to 113 deaths, the coup attempt left581 people wounded.   On Wednesday, Mrs. Aquino declared a nationwide state ofemergency to cope with the crisis. She said Monday she wantedCongress to grant special powers to search for weapons andammunition without the normal legal constraints.   She also said the administration would ask Congress to extend to72 hours the length of time a suspect can be detained withoutcharge. The law requires that suspects be charged within 12 to 36hours of arrest, depending on the severity of the crime.   As a sign of concern, share prices tumbled 8 percent in nervoustrading on the Manila Stock Exchange on Monday, the first day oftrading since the coup attempt was launched.   At a news conference, Mrs. Aquino was asked whether she wasconsidering a Cabinet shakeup after the coup attempt.   ``I believe that by the end of the year we will already know whowe will probably change,'' she said.   Mutineers had demanded that Mrs. Aquino and her governmentresign in favor of a civilian-military junta. Many politicalcommentators also have urged changes in the Cabinet because ofinefficiency in government.   Mrs. Aquino said the bases issue was not discussed when hergovernment asked the United States, through Ambassador NicholasPlatt, to provide air cover for loyal forces.   On Dec. 1, the first day of the coup attempt, U.S. F-4 Phantomjets based in the U.S. Clark Air Base north of Manila provided aircover for loyal troops fighting rebel forces who bombed theMalacanang presidential palace and occupied three military bases.   The talks on the future of the six U.S. military facilities inthe Philippines, whose lease expires in 1991, were set to beginthis month but are expected to start in January or February, Mrs.Aquino said.   Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos said at a separate news conferencethat the flights by U.S. warplanes could have a positive effect onthe talks. He said the jets did not fire on rebel positions asclaimed by opposition politicians.   ``In my view, the forthcoming exploratory talks between twogovernments would be affected in a positive way by that giving ofassistance in a very well-defined manner _ nobody went out ofbounds,'' Ramos said.   Also on Monday, opposition Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile said Mrs.Aquino cannot prove she was elected president of the Philippinesand should resign.   Enrile, the former defense minister, said Mrs. Aquino ``has noevidence that she is the duly elected president of the Philippines.... If there is anybody who should lead the resignation of nationalofficials of the land, it should be Mrs. Aquino.''   Enrile's claim reflects the opinion of a clique of militaryofficers who triggered the February 1986 ``people power''revolution against then-President Ferdinand Marcos but who thenturned against Mrs. Aquino and have tried to overthrow her.   The 1986 uprising began after Enrile and military alliesmutinied against Marcos following a fraud-tainted presidentialelection. No independent vote count was ever completed.   Enrile said he would refuse to cooperate with a presidentialcommission investigating whether he took part in the latest coupattempt. He has denied involvement. He was fired as defenseminister on Nov. 26, 1986, after a failed coup by his followers.</TEXT></DOC>
