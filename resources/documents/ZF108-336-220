 He has also been general manager of ApolloComputer (Canada) Ltd. and of Nixdorf Computer Canada Ltd., both of Toronto.andM;Wyatt holds a degree in business from Fanshawe College in London, Ont.andP;  Hespoke with Computing Canada executive editor Gordon Campbell at the Lotusoffice in Toronto.andM;LotusandM;Lotus Development Corp. of Cambridge, Mass.andP;  was founded in 1982.andP;  Its 1-2-3spreadsheet was a major reason for businesses to adopt personal computersthrough the '80s.andP;  In 1989, the company had net sales of $556 million (U.S.),andO;up 19 per cent from 1988.andP;  Net income was $68 million, up 15 per cent.andM;Late last year, Lotus began delivering new versions of 1-2-3 which had beenannounced in 1987.andP;  As well, the product has been extended to several othertechnology platforms, including mainframes and minicomputers.andM;Lotus Development Canada of Toronto handles Canadian sales, marketing, andtechnical and field support.andP;  It employs 36 people.andM;CC : The computer industry as a whole is suffering through what are perceivedto be some pretty bad times.andP;  Can you tell me how Lotus fits into thissituation?andM;Wyatt: I think that the numbers are a cause for concern in the industry.andO;Recently, Digital's profits were down 44 per cent, and I think Apple was down11 per cent.andP;  The interesting thing is if you read behind the headlines,there's some good news.andM;Workstation sales were up 40 per cent at Digital.andP;  So functionality at theworkstation is what's driving the marketplace.andP;  We provide software in theDOS, now the Unix, and in the future the Vax/VMS and mainframe environment atthe end-user workstation.andP;  So we feel that we will weather this trend in theindustry.andM;CC: One of the things that Lotus is doing is moving into the graphical world.andO;I perceive that that opens up a new market of people who were not comfortablewith what the state of computer technology was a couple of years ago?andM;Wyatt: I feel very comfortable with that comment.andP;  I'm a real Mac fan, eventhough I work in the DOS world.andP;  We've announced that 1-2-3/G, our graphicalproduct for OS/2 Presentation Manager, has gone into beta, and I've done somework with that product and it's an extremely gratifying product to use.andM;For those users who like a graphical environment, we are now going to providereal DOS-type functionality for that world ...andM;CC: Perhaps you could comment on Lotus in the Macintosh world?andM;Wyatt: It's public information that we purchased a company in SausalitoCalif., with some 400,000 lines of Macintosh code, and we have gone on recordas saying we will have a product for the Mac.andM;It will not be in the short term, however.andP;  The issue is creating a commongraphical interface.andP;  As you may know, WordPerfect and Lotus announced acommon interface standard under OS/2 Presentation Manager, and we are tryingto get the Mac product to fit that standard as well, which obviously createssome long-term programming issues because the Mac environment is not the sameas the OS/2 PM environment.andM;CC: So from a straight technical standpoint this is a tough job?andM;Wyatt: Yes.andP;  It can be done, but it's not trivial, and we've got to make surethat we take into account the 10 million Lotus users that are out there.andP;  Ifthey can't look at our Mac product, fire it up, and come up to speedimmediately on it, then we're not meeting our objectives.andM;CC: Lotus is looked at as being primarily a one-product company.andP;  How true isthat today?andM;Wyatt: It's relatively true.andP;  More than 60 per cent of our revenues are fromspreadsheets.andP;  However, spreadsheets now are spreadsheets that operate onDOS, OS/2, OS/2 Presentation Manager.andP;  We've announced the Unix-based productand the Vax and mainframe-based products.andP;  So, yes we're primarily aspreadsheet company, but it is now spreadsheets on multiple platforms.andM;Some of our newer products, such as the latest version of Freelance, arerapidly increasing in revenues and therefore will drive that 60 per centspreadsheet business lower.andM;CC: It is an objective to increase the other side?andM;Wyatt: There's no question.andP;  It is absolutely an objective.andP;  We're doing itwith business graphics products, and we will be doing it with our announcedintentions in the database world with database toolkit products as well.andM;CC: The company has a holding in Sybase?andM;Wyatt: Yes.andP;  We purchased 15 per cent of Sybase, and we have options foranother, I believe, 10 per cent over time.andP;  We also have our seniorvice-president of research and development on Sybase's board.andM;CC: Their part is primarily at the server end of things, database server?andM;Wyatt: Yes.andP;  The world as we see it is sort of dividing into two sides on thedatabase issue.andP;  There's the customer-oriented front end, and there's thedatabase server back end.andM;We are not intending to be in the back-end business.andP;  There are someexcellent companies out there -- Sybase, Oracle, Gupta, for example -- thatdo that job very well.andP;  We're committed to providing the front end to thosedatabase servers to be the viewport, if you will, onto the data.andM;CC: How quickly is that?andM;Wyatt: We're starting the evolution currently with 1-2-3 Release 3.andP;  We havefunctionality called DataLens, which is actually an SQL server-basedcapability which allows you under Release 3 to get access from outsidedatabases, such as Sybase, such as Ashton-Tate's product.andP;  That's the firststep.andM;The second step will be with our product 1-2-3/G, which will offer the sametype of functionality.andP;  Parts of 1-2-3/G under OS/2 Presentation Manager willform parts of our database toolkit.andP;  What I like to call it is a blank sheetof paper which will allow you to do things like forms design, on a free formbasis, and have the intelligence through DataLens to scurry off across thenetwork, find the data and put it in the format you've designed.andM;CC: My understanding is that the number of licences for your LAN productsworks on the honor system.andM;Wyatt: That is absolutely correct.andM;CC: Perhaps you could comment?andM;Wyatt: We removed copy protection from our products some time ago.andP;  It wasfelt for our major customers that the requirements to make extra copies ofsoftware was being hindered, and functionality was being hindered by havingcopy protection, so we removed it, and to a large extent we do work on thehonor system in the corporate environments.andM;So the concept of node licensing is really no different from someone makingmultiple copies of the current 1-2-3.andM;CC: Perhaps you could describe the Canadian operation, what is your objectivein being here?andM;Wyatt: Our major objective is to be close to our customers and to ourresellers, and to provide support to our end-users.andM;CC: Lotus does not actually sell direct?andM;Wyatt: No, we don't.andP;   We have salespeople, but they really drivecorporate demand.andP;  You canandM;order direct from Lotus for a single upgrade.andP;  If you're in a remote areathat's not served by a computer dealer, and you phone our 800 number andorder an upgrade directly from Lotus.andP;  There is one other product we do selldirectly which is Lotus Notes, which is a brand new product, which falls inthe new category of groupware.andP;  We are selling that directly primarily todrive demand for the product and because after reviewing it with the channel,the channel felt that it wasn't appropriate for them to handle it at thisstage.andP;  It's a very complex sale, it's a long-term sale.andM;CC: It's intended for network situations?andM;Wyatt: It's all network-based.andP;  Price Waterhouse has recently purchased10,000 on a worldwide basis to run their company basically on Notes.andM;It's the kind of product where you must have seen your level of commitment tochange the way your company does business.andP;  An example would be a firm doingan audit on a worldwide-based corporation.andP;  You've got to be committed todoing that audit and also translating data and images across the network,around the world.andM;CC: What should we expect in the future?andM;Wyatt: In terms of the next &quot;killer application&quot;, I think in the short termthings will be evolutionary.andP;  In other words, the market as we see it willevolve towards client-server architecture, towards database toolkits, andtowards providing the &quot;compound document&quot; architecture of the future forcommunicating.andM;In terms of revolutionary trends, I think that artificial intelligence isstill one that may bear fruit.andM;We're starting to see AI components in products such as Lotus Agenda.andP;  We'restarting to see it show up more and more in different parts of the industry.andO;As well, I think that voice activation of computers will be something thatwill become viable in the second half of the '90s.andP;  That would berevolutionary.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
