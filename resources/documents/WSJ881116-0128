In a 2-to-1 decision, the Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel said that &quot;an objective observer knowing and understanding all the facts and circumstances could not reasonably question Judge Pollack's impartiality.&quot;    Lawyers for some of the defendants immediately said they would appeal the decision. &quot;We expect to seek either reargument or rehearing by the entire Court of Appeals en banc,&quot; said Martin Flumenbaum, an attorney for Michael Milken, Drexel's junk bond chief. Such hearings, involving the full court, are rarely granted.    A Drexel spokesman said the firm was &quot;disappointed&quot; with the decision. &quot;We have not yet had an opportunity to review it, and our attorneys will be doing so in the next few days,&quot; the spokesman said.    Attorneys for Drexel and four of its employees had asked the appeals court to issue a writ of mandamus. The issuance of such an extraordinary legal tool requires the attorneys to prove that a judge abused his discretion or would be unable to exercise &quot;dispassionate&quot; judgment.    The defense lawyers had urged the appeals court to force the judge to step aside because his wife, Moselle Pollack, stands to receive about $30 million from a leveraged buy-out that Drexel is helping to finance. The transaction, they argued, poses a conflict of interest for the judge.    Barry Goldsmith, an attorney for the SEC's Division of Enforcement, said the SEC is &quot;very pleased with the decision&quot; and is &quot;anxious to get on with the case.&quot; The SEC in September filed a civil suit against Drexel, Mr. Milken, and others, alleging that they had violated U.S. securities laws in connection with 18 different transactions. At that time, the SEC asked that its case be joined with 13 other insider-trading related civil suits over which Judge Pollack is presiding.    Judge Pollack is regarded by many defense lawyers as being tough on defendants in securities cases. In opposing the motion to remove Judge Pollack, first made last month, lawyers for the SEC had argued that Drexel and the others were merely shopping for a more sympathetic judge.    Speaking on behalf of himself and Judge Lawrence W. Pierce, Judge Richard J. Cardamone wrote in a 23-page opinion that the defendants &quot;are entitled to an unbiased judge; not to a judge of their choosing.&quot; Judge Cardamone said that Judge Pollack's connection to Drexel is &quot;too remote to mandate recusal&quot; because Bain Venture Capital, a unit of Bain andamp; Co. -- and not Drexel itself -- is paying Mrs. Pollack the money.    Moreover, they rejected the defense lawyers' claim that Judge Pollack's earlier criticism of them showed that the judge was biased and therefore should be removed. As previously reported, Judge Pollack questioned the integrity of four defense attorneys, and he referred Mr. Flumenbaum and Arthur Liman, another attorney for Mr. Milken, for possible disciplinary action.    The two appeals court judges called Judge Pollack's actions an &quot;appropriate&quot; response to the lawyers' conduct.    But Judge Edward J. Lumbard disagreed with the other judges on the panel. Events, he said, &quot;have created a reasonable doubt of Judge Pollack's impartiality in supervising these cases.&quot; He added that &quot;Judge Pollack's expressed resentment to the suggestion&quot; that he be removed and &quot;his castigation of Drexel and its counsel has confirmed&quot; that &quot;he cannot act impartially in these cases.&quot;    A Drexel spokesman said the firm was &quot;disappointed&quot; with the decision. &quot;We have not yet had an opportunity to review it, and our attorneys will be doing so in the next few days,&quot; the spokesman said.    Judge Lumbard disagreed with his colleagues on Drexel's connection to Mrs. Pollack and the judge, saying it was &quot;hardly so speculative or remote.&quot;    Since the appeals court panel heard arguments by attorneys for Drexel and the SEC last month, certain facts have changed. Judge Cardamone, in his decision, said that Drexel had only a &quot;potential commitment&quot; to Bain because Drexel hadn't signed a firm commitment with Bain or Palais Royal Inc., the company that is owned by Mrs. Pollack's family.    On Friday, Drexel signed a commitment to finance Bain's purchase of Palais Royal. By late Monday, Palais Royal, too, signed an agreement to complete the transaction. That change is likely to be brought before the court in any petition to rehear the case.    When it agreed to consider Drexel's request to remove Judge Pollack last month, the appeals court temporarily barred all proceedings in the SEC case. That has meant that defense attorneys haven't been able to begin taking pretrial testimony from witnesses, as they had hoped.    It has also resulted in a refusal by the SEC to provide Drexel and others with many of the 1.2 million documents the SEC used to support its charges. The SEC had told defense attorneys that it could not give them documents while proceedings were stayed because to do so would be to engage in &quot;unsupervised discovery.&quot;    Yesterday, some defense attorneys said they weren't concerned that a further appeal would create more delays in beginning the process of compelling pretrial testimony from witnesses. They said that because criminal charges are expected to be filed soon against Drexel and others, there would be few opportunities to examine witnesses against them anyway. </TEXT></DOC>
