(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The obscenity conviction of a recordstore owner involving a rap music recording and believed to be thefirst of its kind in the nation is the subject of a new trialopening Monday.   Tommy Hammond, who was convicted in 1988 of violating thiscity's obscenity ordinance by selling the rap group 2 Live Crew's``Move Somethin,''' will be represented by the Civil LibertiesUnion of Alabama at his Tallapoosa County Circuit Court trial.   ``Should this conviction stand, it will open the doors forsimilar prosecutions around the state,'' the organization said in astatement last week.   Hammond's conviction marked the first time music was found to belegally obscene in the United States, the American Civil LibertiesUnion and music industry officials have said.   He was arrested after a woman complained to police about her sonobtaining a copy of the ``Move Somethin''' cassette at Hammond'srecord shop in this city of about 14,000 people about 40 milesnortheast of Montgomery.   Hammond was convicted in municipal court and fined $500.   Under Alabama law, any conviction before a Municipal Court judgemust receive a jury trial at the circuit court level before it canbe appealed.   Hammond's Montgomery attorneys, Robert Segall and ElizabethJohnson, contend he is a victim of discriminatory prosecution.   Segall said another Alexander City record store sold the samerecording after Hammond did, but wasn't prosecuted.   Police told the judge the other record store owner wasn'tarrested because he refused to sell the recording to a policeinformant.   Ms. Johnson said Sunday night that the case also raises theissue of free speech, which is guaranteed under the First Amendmentof the U.S. Constitution.   ``The question is whether or not he can sell the tapes to anadult,'' she said. ``Children do not enter into this case at all.''   An attorney for the city, Daniel Brown, said last year that 2Live Crew violated Alexander City's obscenity laws because thegroup's lyrics provide detailed descriptions of perverse sexualacts and sadomasochism.   Ms. Johnson disagreed at the time, saying ``profanity andoffensive music are not what obscenity is all about. You may beoffended by it, but that doesn't make it obscene.''   The group records under the Miami-based Luke Skywalker label,which paid half of Hammond's legal fees in the first round of thelegal fight.   Label spokeswoman Debbie Bennett has said the recording'ssexually explicit language is intended as humor and is far frombeing obscene.</TEXT></DOC>
