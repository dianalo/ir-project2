Erin Bower, 6, has been fitted with an artificial left hand andis attending school. Next month she undergoes a cornea transplantfor her left eye, which also was damaged in the April 17, 1989,blast at a K mart store.   The person who put the bomb on the K mart shelf remains at large.   ``We're so lucky that internally she's fine and mentally she'sfine. She's such a happy child. She really is,'' said Erin'smother, Maureen Bower.   ``I don't get down as frequently as I used to, but when we hadto make the decision on the cornea transplant, it rehashed all thegarbage again,'' the mother said.   ``That's when I started frequently wishing that this personwould see what he has done. I got real upset with that person, andI usually don't think about that person at all. But when you haveto relive all this again, it's tough,'' she said.   Erin was shopping with her family at the K mart in Castletonwhen she picked up a tube of toothpaste. The tube exploded.   Federal agents remain optimistic they will crack the caseeventually.   ``We believe we've finally turned the corner, and we're veryhopeful at this point,'' said Charles A. Petersen, agent in chargeof the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms inIndianapolis. He declined to elaborate.   Ed Verkin, an agent in the agency's Louisville, Ky., bureau,says a laboratory examining fragments of the pipe bomb has foundsome new evidence in the case, but he, too, declined to elaborate.   Rewards totaling about $50,000 remain posted in the case.   ``She's doing great,'' Mrs. Bower said. ``Emotionally, there isno problem, which is an absolute miracle.''   ``She hasn't missed a beat,'' said her father, Kevin. ``She'ddoing real well, getting very good grades. She's becoming more of alittle bit of a leader in her class.   ``The kids have been great. They'll ask questions (about herartificial hand) and look, but as soon as that period is over, theydon't even think about it,'' Bower said. ``They think Erin's likeeverybody else.''   As April 17 nears, the Bowers sense it will be a difficult daybut not an impossible one.   ``It's hard to believe a year is coming up,'' Mrs. Bower said.``I think that day will be kind of hard. I'm sure I'll think aboutit an awful lot. I already think about it. But it's over with.There's nothing we can do about it now. I think we're beyond it.</TEXT></DOC>
