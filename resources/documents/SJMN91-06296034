Kaiser Convention Center.;   From the center's front steps, you could seethe flames in the Oakland hills, just past Lake Merrit. Smoke billowed outsidethe hall.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  GIVING A VOICE TO TEEN-AGE RAGE  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Music Review  </MEMO><TEXT>     Inside, on a stage lit mostly in orange and red, four bands whose music isbased on rage set metaphoric fires of their own.;   More than 7,000 ticketswere sold for co-headliners Anthrax and Public Enemy, along with locals Primusand Young Black Teenagers.;   Promoter Bill Graham said he consideredcanceling the show because of the nearby disaster, but when he asked OaklandPolice for advice, they told him to let it continue.;   &quot;They said it would bebetter to put the show on, rather than the 7,000 people on the streets,&quot;Graham said.;   Graham said he would donate the profits from the show to somekind of fire-relief charity.;   Wild night; Meanwhile, inside, there waslittle mention of the disaster. Rapper Flavor Flav asked the audience to marka moment of silence for those who lost their houses -- &quot;for about threeseconds,&quot; he said -- but many still whooped and yelled.;   This wasn't a nightfor control. It was a night for teen-agers to let out their rage.;   &quot;I don'tbelieve all those people who say you guys are crazy,&quot; said Anthrax's leadsinger, Joey Belladonna. &quot;You are all just doing what you want. I think you'regreat.&quot;;   For some, that meant that people in front of the stage -- the areacalled &quot;the pit&quot; -- were running into each other, hitting each other withforearms and throwing people up in the air. It wasn't as violent as lastweek's Metallica show, but there was still a steady stream of boys with bloodyfaces in the restrooms.;   The top three groups played 45-minute sets, withAnthrax and Public Enemy coming back for a shared encore, &quot;Bring the Noize.&quot;;  Although Anthrax came on last, Public Enemy stole the show. The group, whichstarted out as one of the most radical black rap acts, has successfullycrossed over to a mainstream audience, without sacrificing its politics.;  This could have been David Duke's worst nightmare: a hall full of suburbanwhite kids, with some blacks thrown in, dancing to &quot;Fight the Power,&quot; whilebehind the two rappers stood four militaristic-looking guys in black suits andred Guardian Angels-style caps.;   I'm sure Duke takes Public Enemy's nameliterally.;   But this may have been the night's most positive moment. Themessage of this music, which started in the ghettos of New York andWashington, could now be shared, regardless of race or economic background.Anyone who 10 years ago said rap would never last, had only to see this sceneto know it was time to eat his words.;   Smooth show; Public Enemy's show hasgotten smooth over the years, with choreographed bursts of light and interplaywith the audience. The sound system was a bit muddy, but you could make outthe main lyrics of &quot;Don't Believe the Hype&quot; and &quot;Can't Truss It,&quot; the lastsong.;   Flav had a message for President Bush before that song, a messagethat involved oral sex and can't be explained here. Then, mid-beat, the banddisappeared, as if to show you can't truss them either.;   Anthrax played aset of speed metal, with drums beating as fast as a hummingbird's heart. Theirlyrics on &quot;Caught in a Mosh&quot; and &quot;I'm the Man&quot; could be discerned only bysomeone with a teen-ager's endocrine system and metabolism.;   They had therage of the early Who, Clash and Sex Pistols, but it was fairly impossible inthis set to tell if they had the talent.;   Primus, a Bay Area band that isdeveloping a national following, clearly showed it did have the talent. Onsongs such as &quot;Those Damn Blue Collar Tweakers&quot; and &quot;Tommy the Cat&quot; they mixedspeed metal with slower sub-beats and tempered their rage with humor.;   Ifopener Y.B.T. had been banned from using profanity in its brief 20-minute set,the audience would have heard only a few pronouns and a loud bass beat.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  BRAD KAVA, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911022  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  October  </MONTH><PG.COL>  3E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  710  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday, October 22, 199100296034,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
