He succeeds Lester L. Colbert Jr., 53, who remains chairman. Mr. Colbert said in a news release that, after 15 years as president and chief executive, he has concluded it is time for him &quot;to take a less active role.&quot; He praised Mr. Zaccaria as a 17-year veteran of the company who has served it in a number of posts and has &quot;ability, experience and judgment to assume executive leadership.&quot;    Separately, the maker of data storage products said net income for its first quarter ended Sept. 30 fell 80% to $5.5 million, or 13 cents a share, on sales that rose 15% to $155.7 million. Year-earlier profit was $9.8 million, or 22 cents a share, on sales of $135.1 million, but was substantially bolstered by a $6.6 million gain that came primarily from sale of certain holdings in another company.    Messrs. Colbert and Zaccaria couldn't be reached for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
