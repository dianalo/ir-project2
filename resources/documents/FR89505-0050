This updateproposes to add 10 new sites to the NPL. The NPL is Appendix B to the NationalOil and Hazardous Substances Contingency Plan (``NCP''), which was promulgatedon July 16, 1982 pursuant to section 105 of the Comprehensive EnvironmentalResponse, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (``CERCLA'') (amendedby the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (``SARA''))and Executive Order 12580 (52 FR 2923, January 29, 1987). CERCLA requiresthat the NCP include a list of national priorities among the known releasesor threatened releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminantsthroughout the United States, and that the list be revised at least annually.The NPL, initially promulgated on September 8, 1983 (48 FR 40658), constitutesthis list. These sites are being proposed because they meet the listing requirementsof the NPL. This notice provides the public with an opportunity to commenton placing these sites on the NPL. This proposed rule brings the number of proposed NPL sites to 283, 22 ofthem in the Federal section; 890 are on the final NPL, 41 of them in theFederal section. Final and proposed sites now total 1,173.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>Comments must be submitted on or before July 5, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>Comments may be mailed to Larry Reed, Acting Director,Hazardous Site Evaluation Division (Attn: NPL Staff), Office of Emergencyand Remedial Response (OS-230), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401M Street SW., Washington DC 20460.

Introduction</ITAG>BackgroundIn 1980, Congress enacted the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation,and Liability Act, 42 U.S.C. 9601-9657 (``CERCLA'' or the ``Act'') in responseto the dangers of uncontrolled or abandoned hazardous waste sites. CERCLAwas amended in 1986 by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act(``SARA''), Public Law No. 99-499, stat. 1613 <T3>et. seq.</T3> To implement CERCLA, the Environmental Protection Agency(``EPA'' or ``the Agency'') promulgated the revised National Oil and HazardousSubstances Contingency Plan (``NCP''), 40 CFR Part 300, on July 16, 1982(47 FR 31180), pursuant to CERCLA section 105 and Executive Order 12316(46 FR 42237, August 20, 1981). The NCP, further revised by EPA on September16, 1985 (50 FR 37624) and November 20, 1985 (50 FR 47912), sets forthguidelines and procedures needed to respond under CERCLA to releases andthreatened releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants.On December 21, 1988 (53 FR 51394), EPA proposed revisions to the NCP inresponse to SARA. Section 105(a)(8)(A) of CERCLA, as amended by SARA, requires that the NCPinclude criteria for determining priorities among releases or threatenedreleases throughout the United States for the purpose of taking remedialaction and, to the extent practicable, take into account the potentialurgency of such action for the purpose of taking removal action. Removalaction involves cleanup or other actions that are taken in response toreleases or threats of releases on a short-term or temporary basis (CERCLAsection 101(23)). Remedial action tends to be long-term in nature and involvesresponse actions that are consistent with a permanent remedy for a release(CERCLA section 101(24)). Criteria for determining priorities for possibleremedial actions financed by the Trust Fund established under CERCLA areincluded in the Hazard Ranking System (``HRS''), which EPA promulgatedas Appendix A of the NCP (47 FR 31219, July 16, 1982). On December 23,1988 (53 FR 51962), EPA proposed revisions to the HRS in response to SARA.EPA intends to issue the revised HRS as soon as possible. However, untilthe proposed revisions have been subject to public comment and put intoeffect, EPA will continue to propose and promulgate sites using the currentHRS, in accordance with CERCLA section 105(c)(1) and Congressional intent,as explained on March 31, 1989 (54 FR 13296).Section 105(a)(8)(B) of CERCLA, as amended by SARA, requires that the statutorycriteria provided by the HRS be used to prepare a list of national prioritiesamong the known releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances,pollutants, or contaminants throughout the United States. The list, whichis Appendix B of the NCP, is the National Priorities List (``NPL''). Section105(a)(8)(B) also requires that the NPL be revised at least annually. Asite can undergo CERCLA-financed remedial action only after it is placedon the NPL, as provided in the NCP at 40 CFR 300.66(c)(2) and 300.68(a).An original NPL of 406 sites was promulgated on September 8, 1983 (48 FR40658). The NPL has been expanded since then, most recently on March 31,1989 (54 FR 13296). The Agency also has published a number of proposedrulemakings to add sites to the NPL, most recently Update andplusmin;7 onJune 24, 1988 (53 FR 23988).EPA may delete sites from the NPL where no further response is appropriate,as explained in the NCP at 40 CFR 300.66(c)(7). To date, the Agency hasdeleted 26 sites from the final NPL.This notice proposes to add 10 sites to the NPL. Adding these 10 sitesto the 273 sites previously proposed brings the total number of proposedsites to 283. The final NPL contains 890 sites, for a total of 1,173 finaland proposed sites.EPA is proposing to include on the NPL sites at which there are or havebeen releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances, pollutants,or contaminants. The discussion below may refer to ``releases or threatenedreleases'' simply as ``releases,'' ``facilities,'' or ``sites.''Public Comment PeriodThis <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice opens the formal 60-day comment periodfor NPL Update andplusmin;8. Comments may be mailed to Larry Reed, ActingDirector, Hazardous Site Evaluation Division (Attn: NPL staff), Officeof Emergency and Remedial Response (OS-230), U.S. Environmental ProtectionAgency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460.The Headquarters and Regional public dockets for the NPL (see <T2>ADDRESSES </T2>portion of this notice) contain documents relating tothe scoring of these proposed sites. The dockets are available for viewing``by appointment only'' after the appearance of this notice. The hoursof operation for the Headquarters docket are from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.,Monday through Friday excluding Federal holidays. Please contact individualRegional dockets for hours.The Headquarters docket for NPL Update andplusmin;8 contains HRS score sheetsfor each proposed site, a Documentation Record for each site describingthe information used to compute the score, a list of documents referencedin the Documentation Record, and pertinent information for any site affectedby statutory requirements and listing policies.Each Regional docket includes all information available in the Headquartersdocket for sites in that Region, as well as the actual reference documents,which contain the data EPA relied upon in calculating or evaluating theHRS scores for sites in that Region. These reference documents are availableonly in the Regional dockets. They may be viewed ``by appointment only''in the appropriate Regional Docket or Superfund Branch office. Requestsfor copies may be directed to the appropriate Regional docket or SuperfundBranch.An informal written request, rather than a formal request, should be theordinary procedure for obtaining copies of any of these documents.EPA considers all comments received during the formal comment period. Duringthe comment period, comments are available to the public only in the Headquartersdocket. A complete set of comments pertaining to sites in a particularEPA Region will be available for viewing in the Regional docket approximatelyone week after the formal comment period closes. Comments received afterthe comment period closes will be available in the Headquarters docketand in the appropriate Regional Office docket on an ``as received'' basis.An informal written request, rather than a formal request, should be theordinary procedure for obtaining copies of any comments. After consideringthe relevant comments received during the comment period, EPA will addto the NPL all proposed sites that meet EPA's requirements. In past NPLrulemakings, EPA has considered, to the extent practicable, comments receivedafter the close of the comment period. EPA will attempt to do so in thisrulemaking as well.Early CommentsIn certain instances, interested parties have written to EPA concerningsites that were not at that time proposed to the NPL. If those sites arelater proposed to the NPL, parties should review their earlier concernsand, if they still consider them appropriate, resubmit those concerns forconsideration during the formal comment period. Site-specific correspondencereceived prior to formal proposal generally will not be included in thedocket.Comments Lacking SpecificityEPA anticipates that some comments will consist of or include additionalstudies or supporting documentation, e.g., hydrogeology reports, lab data,and previous site studies. Where commenters do not indicate what specificscoring issues the supporting documentation addresses, or what they wantEPA to evaluate in the supporting documentation, EPA can only attempt torespond to such documents as best it can. Any commenter submitting additionaldocumentation to EPA should indicate what specific points in that documentationEPA is to consider. As the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of ColumbiaCircuit noted in <T3>Northside Sanitary Landfill </T3>v. <T3>Thomas andamp; EPA</T3>, 849 F. 2d 1516, 1520 (D.C. Cir. 1988) cert.pending No. 88-1035, during notice-and-comment rulemaking a commenter mustexplain with some specificity how any documents submitted are relevantto issues in the rulemaking.Availability of InformationEPA has published a statement describing what background information (resultingfrom the initial investigation of potential CERCLA sites) the Agency disclosesin response to Freedom of Information Act requests (52 FR 5578, February25, 1987).<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Purpose and Implementation of the NPL</ITAG>PurposeThe primary purpose of the NPL is stated in the legislative history ofCERCLA (Report of the Committee on Environment and Public Works, SenateReport No. 96-848, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 60 (1980)):<ITAG tagnum="21">The priority lists serves primarily informational purposes, identifyingfor the States and the public those facilities and sites or other releaseswhich appear to warrant remedial actions. Inclusion of a facility or siteon the list does not in itself reflect a judgment of the activities ofits owner or operator, it does not require those persons to undertake anyaction, nor does it assign liability to any person. Subsequent governmentaction in the form of remedial actions or enforcement actions will be necessaryin order to do so, and these actions will be attended by all appropriateprocedural safeguards.</ITAG>The purpose of the NPL, therefore, is primarily to serve as an informationaland management tool. The initial identification of a site for the NPL isintended primarily to guide EPA in determining which sites warrant furtherinvestigation to assess the nature and extent of the public health andenvironmental risks associated with the site and to determine what CERCLA-financedremedial action(s), if any, may be appropriate. The NPL also serves tonotify the public of sites EPA believes warrant further investigation.Federal facility sites are eligible for the NPL pursuant to the NCP at40 CFR 300.66(c)(2). However, section 111(e)(3) of CERCLA, as amended bySARA, limits the expenditure of CERCLA monies at federally-owned facilities.Federal facility sites are also subject to the requirements of CERCLA section120, added by SARA.ImplementationA site can undergo remedial action financed by the Trust Fund only afterit is placed on the final NPL as outlined in the NCP at 40 CFR 300.66(c)(2)and 300.68(a). However, EPA may take enforcement actions under CERCLA orother applicable statutes against responsible parties regardless of whetherthe site is on the NPL, although, as a practical matter, the focus of EPA'senforcement actions has been and will continue to be on NPL sites. Similarly,in the case of removal actions, EPA has the authority to act at any site,whether listed or not, that meets the criteria of the NCP at 40 CFR 300.65-67.EPA's policy is to pursue cleanup of NPL sites using the appropriate responseand/or enforcement actions available to the Agency, including authoritiesother than CERCLA. Listing a site will serve as notice to any potentiallyresponsible party that the Agency may initiate CERCLA-financed remedialaction. The Agency will decide on a site-by-site basis whether to takeenforcement or other action under CERCLA or other authorities, proceeddirectly with CERCLA-financed response actions and seek to recover responsecosts after cleanup, or do both. To the extent feasible, once sites areon the NPL, EPA will determine high-priority candidates for Superfund-financedresponse action and/or enforcement action through both State and Federalinitiatives. These determinations will take into account which approachis more likely to most expeditiously accomplish cleanup of the site whileusing CERCLA's limited resources as efficiently as possible.Remedial response actions will not necessarily be funded in the same orderas a site's ranking on the NPL_that is, its HRS score. The informationcollected to develop HRS scores is not sufficient in itself to determineeither the extent of contamination or the appropriate response for a particularsite. EPA relies on further, more detailed studies in the remedial investigation/feasibilitystudy (RI/FS) to address these concerns.The RI/FS determines the type and extent of contamination. It also takesinto account the amount of contaminants in the environment, the risk toaffected populations and environment, the cost to correct problems at thesite, and the response actions that have been taken by potentially responsibleparties or others. Decisions on the type and extent of action to be takenat these sites are made in accordance with the criteria contained in SubpartF of the NCP. After conducting these additional studies, EPA may concludethat it is not desirable to initiate a CERCLA remedial action at some siteson the NPL because of more pressing needs at other sites, or because aprivate party cleanup is already underway pursuant to an enforcement action.Given the limited resources available in the Trust Fund, the Agency mustcarefully balance the relative needs for response at the numerous sitesit has studied. It is also possible that EPA will conclude after furtheranalysis that the site does not warrant remedial action.<T3>RI/FS at Proposed Sites. </T3>An RI/FS can be performed at proposedsites (or even non-NPL sites) pursuant to the Agency's removal authorityunder CERCLA, as outlined in the NCP at 40 CFR 300.68(a)(1). (Section 101(23)of CERCLA defines ``remove'' or ``removal'' to include ``such actions asmay be necessary to monitor, assess and evaluate the release or threatof release * * *.'' The definition of ``removal'' also includes ``actiontaken under section 104(b) of this Act * * *,'' which authorizes the Agencyto perform studies, investigations, and other information-gathering activities.)Although an RI/FS is generally conducted at a site after the site has beenplaced on the NPL, in a number of circumstances the Agency elects to conductan RI/FS at a proposed NPL site in preparation for a possible CERCLA-financedremedial action, such as when the Agency believes that a delay may createunnecessary risks to human health or the environment. In addition, theAgency may conduct an RI/FS to assist in determining whether to conducta removal or enforcement action at a site.<T3>Facility (Site) Boundaries. </T3>A `'facility'' is defined under CERCLAsection 101(9) and the NCP at 40 CFR 300.6 as ``(A) any building, structure,* * * well, pit, pond, * * * or (B) any site or area where a hazardoussubstance has been deposited, stored, disposed of, or placed, or otherwisecome to be located * * *.'' (The term ``site'' is frequently used interchangeablywith facility.) The ``come to be located'' language implements the broadremedial purposes of CERCLA, giving EPA authority to clean up contaminationwhen it has spread from the original source. In <T3>U.S. </T3>v. <T3>Bliss, </T3>667 F. Supp. 1298, 1305 (E.D. Mo. 1987), the courts haveaffirmed this interpretation:<ITAG tagnum="21">As the Special Master noted succinctly in <T3>United States </T3>v. <T3>Conservation Chemical Co., </T3>619 F. Supp. [162,] at 185 [(W.D.Mo.1985)], ``simply put, the term `facility' includes any place where hazardoussubstances come to be located.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Thus, to show that an area is a ``facility'', the plaintiff need onlyshow that a hazardous substance has been placed there or has ``otherwisecome to be located'' there.</ITAG>The extent of the contamination, and thus the ``facility'', is first describedwhen a release or threatened release is scored using the HRS. However,HRS scoring and the subsequent listing of a release merely represent theinitial determination that a certain area may need to be addressed underCERCLA. Accordingly, EPA contemplates that the preliminary descriptionof facility boundaries at the time of scoring will need to be refined andimproved as more information is developed as to where the contaminationhas come to be located; this refining step generally comes during the RI/FSstage. As the NCP provides at 40 CFR 300.68(d):<ITAG tagnum="21">An RI/FS shall * * * determine the nature and extent of the threatpresented by the release and * * * evaluate proposed remedies. This includes* * * the gathering of sufficient information to determine the necessityfor and proposed extent of remedial action.</ITAG>The preliminary description of a facility when it is listed does not precludethe Agency, during the RI/FS, from following the contamination as far asit goes, and then considering the facility, for response purposes, as theentire area where hazardous substances have come to be located, even ifthat area extends beyond the boundary for which the site was named.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. NPL Update Process</ITAG>There are three mechanisms for placing sites on the NPL. The principalmechanism is the application of the HRS. The HRS serves as a screeningdevice to evaluate the relative potential of uncontrolled hazardous substancesto cause human health or safety problems, or ecological or environmentaldamage. The HRS score is calculated by estimating risks presented in threepotential ``pathways'' of human or environmental exposure: ground water,surface water, and air. Within each pathway of exposure, the HRS considersthree categories of factors ``that are designed to encompass most aspectsof the likelihood of exposure to a hazardous substance through a releaseand the magnitude or degree of harm from such exposure'': (1) Factors thatindicate the presence or likelihood of a release to the environment; (2)factors that indicate the nature and quantity of the substances presentingthe potential threat; and (3) factors that indicate the human or environmental``targets'' potentially at risk from the site. Factors within each of thesethree categories are assigned a numerical value according to a set scale.Once numerical values are computed for each factor, the HRS uses mathematicalformulas that reflect the relative importance and interrelationships ofthe various factors to arrive at a final site score on a scale of 0 to100. The resultant HRS score represents an estimate of the relative ``probabilityand magnitude of harm to the human population or sensitive environmentfrom exposure to hazardous substances as a result of the contaminationof ground water, surface water, or air (47 FR 31180, July 16, 1982). Thosesites that score 28.50 or greater on the HRS are eligible for the NPL.Under the second mechanism for adding sites to the NPL, each State maydesignate a single site as its top priority, regardless of the HRS score.This mechanism is provided by section 105(a)(8)(B) of CERCLA, as amendedby SARA, which requires that, to the extent practicable, the NPL includewithin the 100 highest priorities, one facility designated by each Staterepresenting the greatest danger to public health, welfare, or the environmentamong known facilities in the State.The third mechanism for listing, included in the NCP at 40 CFR 300.66(b)(4)(50 FR 37624, September 16, 1985), has been used only in rare instances.It allows certain sites with HRS scores below 28.50 to be eligible forthe NPL if all of the following occur:<ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry of theU.S. Department of Health and Human Services has issued a health advisorywhich recommends dissociation of individuals from the release.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; EPA determines that the release poses a significant threatto public health.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; EPA anticipates that it will be more cost-effective to useits remedial authority than to use its removal authority to respond tothe release.</ITAG>States have the primary responsibility for identifying sites, computingHRS scores, and submitting candidate sites to the EPA Regional Offices.EPA Regional Offices conduct a quality control review of the States' candidatesites, and may assist in investigating, sampling, monitoring, and scoringsites. Regional Offices may also consider candidate sites in addition tothose submitted by States. EPA Headquarters conducts further quality assuranceaudits to ensure accuracy and consistency among the various EPA and Stateoffices participating in the scoring. The Agency then proposes the sitesthat meet the eligibility criteria (and EPA's additional listing requirements)and solicits public comment on the proposal. Based on these comments andfurther review by EPA, the Agency determines final HRS scores and placesthose sites that still qualify on the NPL.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Statutory Requirements and Listing Policies</ITAG>CERCLA restricts EPA's authority to respond to certain categories of releasesof hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants by expressly excludingsome substances, such as petroleum, from the response program. In addition,CERCLA section 105(a)(8)(B) directs EPA to list priority sites ``among''the known releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances, pollutants,or contaminants, and section 105(a)(8)(A) directs EPA to consider certainenumerated and ``other appropriate'' factors in doing so. Thus, as a matterof policy, EPA has the discretion not to use CERCLA to respond to certaintypes of releases. For example, EPA has chosen not to list sites that resultfrom contamination associated with facilities licensed by the Nuclear RegulatoryCommission (NRC), on the grounds that the NRC has the authority and expertiseto clean up releases from those facilities (48 FR 40661, September 8, 1983).Where other authorities exist, placing the site on the NPL for possibleremedial action under CERCLA may not be appropriate. Therefore, EPA haschosen to defer certain types sites from the NPL even though CERCLA mayprovide authority to respond. If, however, the Agency later determinesthat sites not listed as a matter of policy are not being properly respondedto, the Agency may place them on the NPL. The listing policies and statutoryrequirements of particular relevance to this proposed rule cover sitesinvolving Subtitle C of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)and sites with ``special study wastes.'' They are discussed below. Theseand other listing policies and statutory requirements have been explainedin greater detail in previous rulemakings, the latest being June 24, 1988(53 FR 23978 and 53 FR 23988).Releases From Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) SitesOn June 10, 1986 (51 FR 21054), EPA announced a decision on componentsof a policy for the listing or the deferral from listing on the NPL ofseveral categories of non-Federal sites subject to RCRA Subtitle C correctiveaction authorities. Under the policy, sites not subject to RCRA SubtitleC corrective action authorities will continue to be placed on the NPL.Examples of such site include:<ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Facilities that ceased treating, storing, or disposing ofhazardous waste prior to November 19, 1980 (the effective date of PhaseI of the Subtitle C regulations) and to which the RCRA corrective actionor other authorities of Subtitle C cannot be applied.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Sites at which only materials exempted from the statutoryor regulatory definition of solid waste or hazardous waste are managed.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Contamination areas resulting from the activities of RCRAhazardous waste handlers to which RCRA Subtitle C corrective action authoritiesdo not apply, such as hazardous waste generators or transporters, whichare not required to have Interim Status or a final RCRA permit.</ITAG>Also under the policy, certain RCRA sites at which Subtitle C correctiveaction authorities are available may also be listed if they meet the criteriafor listing (e.g., an HRS score of 28.50 or greater) and they fall withinone of the following categories:<ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Facilities owned by persons who have demonstrated an inabilityto finance a cleanup as evidenced by their invocation of the bankruptcylaws.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Facilities that have lost authorization to operate, and forwhich there are additional indications that the owner or operator willbe unwilling to undertake corrective action.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Sites, analyzed on a case-by-case basis, whose owners oroperators have a clear history of unwillingness to undertake correctionaction.</ITAG>On August 9, 1988 (53 FR 30005), EPA published a policy for determiningwhether RCRA facilities are unwilling to perform corrective actions, andtherefore should be proposed to the NPL. Additionally, on August 9, 1988(53 FR 30002), EPA published a policy statement requesting comment on apolicy for determining when an owner/operator should be considered unableto pay for addressing the contamination at a RCRA-regulated site.On June 24, 1988 (53 FR 23978), EPA proposed to list RCRA sites in severalother categories which the Agency considers appropriate for placement onthe NPL. These categories are non- or late filers, converters, protectivefilers, and sites holding permits issued before enactment of the Hazardousand Solid Waste Amendments of 1984.This update proposes a RCRA site in the converter category:<ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Tri-Cities Barrel Co., Inc., Port Crane, New York.</ITAG>Documents supporting the RCRA determination for this site are availablefor review in both the Headquarters and appropriate Regional docket. Commentersare encouraged to provide documentation where they believe EPA's RCRA determinationis in error.Releases of Special Study WastesSection 105(g) of CERCLA, as amended by SARA, requires additional informationbefore sites involving RCRA ``special study wastes'' can be proposed forthe NPL (until revisions to the HRS are effected). Section 105(g) appliesto sites that (1) were not on or proposed for the NPL as of October 17,1986 and (2) contain sufficient quantities of special study wastes as definedunder RCRA sections 3001(b)(2) (drilling fluids), 3001(b)(3)(A)(ii) (miningwastes), and 3001(b)(3)(A)(iii) (cement kiln dust). Before these sitescan be added to the NPL, SARA requires that the following information beconsidered:<ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; The extent to which the HRS score for the facility is affectedby the presence of the special study waste at or released from the facility.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Available information as to the quantity, toxicity, and concentrationof hazardous substances that are constitutents of any special study wasteat or released from the facility; the extent of or potential for releaseof such hazardous constituents; the exposure or potential exposure to humanpopulation and environment; and the degree of hazard to human health orthe environment posed by the release of such hazardous constituents atthe facility.</ITAG>Update andplusmin;8 proposes three sites containing or potentially containingspecial study wastes. EPA has placed in the dockets addenda that evaluatefor each proposed site the information called for in section 105(g). Theaddenda indicate that the special study wastes present a threat to humanhealth and the environment, and that the sites should be proposed to theNPL. The site sare:<ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Eastern Michaud Flats Contamination, Pocatello, Idaho. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Kerr-McGee Chemical Corp. (Soda Springs Plant), Soda Springs,Idaho.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Monsanto Chemical Co. (Soda Springs Plant), Soda Springs,Idaho.</ITAG>CERCLA section 125, as amended by SARA, addresses special study wastesdescribed in RCRA section 3001(b)(3)(A)(i) (fly ash and related wastes).No sites in this rule are subject to the provisions of section 125.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Contents of Proposed NPL Update andplusmin;8    </ITAG>Table 1 following this preamble lists 10 sites proposed for the NPL inUpdate andplusmin;8. Each entry contains the name of the facility and theState and city or county in which it is located. All sites received HRSscores of 28.50 or above.   Each proposed site is placed by score in a group corresponding to groupsof 50 sites presented within the final NPL. For example, a site in Group8 of the proposed update has a score that falls within the range of scorescovered by a the eighth group of 50 sites on the final NPL. The NPL isarranged by HRS scores and is presented in groups of 50 to emphasize thatminor differences in scores do not necessarily represent significantlydifferent levels of risk.   In the past, each entry was accompanied by one or more notations reflectingthe status of response and cleanup activities at the site at the time thislist was prepared. EPA is developing a report summarizing response activitiesat NPL sites. The report will be available shortly. In the interim, informationon activities at the new proposed sites is available in the site summariesor upon request to the appropriate Regional Office.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Regulatory Impact Analysis   </ITAG>The costs of cleanup actions that may be taken at sites are not directlyattributable to listing on the NPL, as explained below. Therefore, theAgency has determined that this rulemaking is not a ``major'' regulationunder Executive Order 12291. EPA has conducted a preliminary analysis ofeconomic implications of today's proposal to add new sites. EPA believesthat the kinds of economic effects associated with this proposed revisionare generally similar to those identified in the regulatory impact analysis(RIA) prepared in 1982 for revisions to the NCP pursuant to section 105of CERCLA (47 FR 31180, July 16, 1982) and the economic analysis preparedwhen amendments to the NCP were proposed (50 FR 5882, February 12, 1985).The Agency believes the anticipated economic effects related to proposingthe addition of these sites to the NPL can be characterized in terms ofthe conclusions of the earlier RIA and the most recent economic analysis.This rule was submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for reviewas required by Executive Order 12291.Costs   EPA has determied that this proposed rulemaking is not a ``major'' regulationunder Executive Order 12291 because inclusion of a site on the NPL doesnot itself impose any costs. It does not establish that EPA will necessarilyundertake remedial action, nor does it require any action by a privateparty or determine its liability for site response costs. Costs that ariseout of site responses result from site-by-site decisions about what actionsto take, not directly from the act of listing itself. Nonetheless, it isuseful to consider the costs associated with responding to all sites includedin this proposed rulemaking.   The major events that follow the proposed listing of a site on the NPLare a search for potentially responsible parties and a remedial investigation/feasibilitystudy (RI/FS) to determine if remedial actions will be undertaken at asite. Design and constuction of the selected remedial alternative followcompletion of the RI/FS, and operation and maintenance (Oandamp;M) activitiesmay continue after construction has been completed.   EPA initially bears costs associated with responsible party searches. Responsibleparties may bear some or all the costs of the RI/FS, remedial design andconstruction, and Oandamp;M, or EPA and the states may share costs.   The State cost share for site cleanup activities has been amended by section104 of SARA. For privately-owned sites, as well as at publicly-owned butnot publicly-operated sites, EPA will pay for 100% of the costs of theRI/FS and remedial planning, and 90% of the costs associated with remedialaction. The State will be responsible for 10% of the remedial action. Forpublicly-operated sites, the State cost share is at least 50% of all responsecosts at the site, including the RI/FS and remedial design and constructionof the remedial action selected. After the remedy is built, costs fallinto two categories: <ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; For restoration of ground water and surface water, EPA willshare in startup costs according to the criteria in the previous paragraphfor 10 years or until a sufficient level of protectiveness is achievedbefore the end of 10 years.    </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; For other cleanups EPA will share for up to 1 year the costof that portion of response needed to assure that a remedy is operationaland functional. After that, the State assumes full responsibilities forOandamp;M.</ITAG>In previous NPL rulemakings, the Agency estimated the costs associatedwith these activities (RI/FS, remedial design, remedial action, and Oandamp;M)on an average per site and total cost basis. EPA will continue with thisapproach, using the most recent (1988) cost estimates available; theseestimates are presented below. However, there is wide variation in costsfor individual sites, depending on the amount, type, and extent of contamination.Additionally, EPA is unable to predict what portions of the total costsresponsible parties will bear, since the distribution of costs dependson the extent of voluntary and negotiated response and the success of anycost-recovery actions.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,s25,11</C> <H1>Cost category</H1><H1>Average total cost per site \1\</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">RI/FS<D>1,100,000</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Remedial Design<D>750,000</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Remedial Action<D>\2\ 13,500,000</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Net present value of Oandamp;M \3\<D>\2\ 3,770,000  </D><F>\1\ 1988 U.S. Dollars  </F><F>\2\ Includes State cost-share  </F><F>\3\ Assumes cost of Oandamp;M over 30 years, $400,000 for the first yearand 10% discount rate.  </F><F>Source: Office of Program Management, Office of Emergency and RemedialResponse, U.S. EPA.</F></ITAG></ITAG>       Costs to States associated with today's proposed rule arise from the requiredState cost-share of: (1) 10% of remedial actions and 10% of first-yearOandamp;M costs at privately-owned sites and sites which are publicly-ownedbut not publicly-operated; and (2) at least 50% of the remedial planning(RI/FS and remedial design), remedial action, and first-year Oandamp;M costsat publicly-operated sites. States will assume the cost for Oandamp;M afterEPA's period of participation. Using the assumptions developed in the 1982RIA for the NCP, EPA has assumed that 90% of the 10 sites proposed forthe NPL in this rule will be privately-owned and 10% will be State- orlocally-operated. Therefore, using the budget projections presented above,the cost to States of undertaking Federal remedial planning and actions,but excluding Oandamp;M costs, would be approximately $20 million. StateOandamp;M costs cannot be accurately determined because EPA, as noted above,will share Oandamp;M costs for up to 10 years for restoration of ground waterand surface water, and it is not known how many sites will require thistreatment and for how long. However, based on past experience, EPA believesa reasonable estimate is that it will share startup costs for up to 10years at 25% of sites. Using this estimate, State Oandamp;M costs would beapproximately $32 million.Proposing a hazardous waste site for the final NPL does not itself causefirms responsible for the site to bear costs. Nonetheless, a listing mayinduce firms to clean up the sites voluntarily, or it may act as a potentialtrigger for subsequent enforcement or cost-recovery actions. Such actionsmay impose costs on firms, but the decisions to take such actions are discretionaryand made on a case-by-case basis. Consequently, precise estimates of theseeffects cannot be made. EPA does not believe that every site will be cleanedup by a responsible party. EPA cannot project at this time which firmsor industry sectors will bear specific portions of the response costs,but the Agency considers: the volume and nature of the waste at the sites;the strength of the evidence linking the wastes at the site to the parties;the parties' ability to pay; and other factors when deciding whether andhow to proceed against the parties.Economy-wide effects of this proposed amendment to the NCP are aggregationsof effects of firms and State and local governments. Although effects couldbe felt by some individual firms and States, the total impact of this proposalon output, prices, and employment is expected to be negligible at the nationallevel, as was the case in the 1982 RIA.BenefitsThe real benefits associated with today's proposal to place additionalsites on the NPL are increased health and environmental protection as aresult of increased public awareness of potential hazards. In additionto the potential for more Federally-financed remedial actions, expansionof the NPL could accelerate privately-financed, voluntary cleanup efforts.Proposing sites as national priority targets may also give States increasedsupport for funding responses at particular sites.As a result of the additional CERCLA remedies, there will be lower humanexposure to high-risk chemicals, and higher-quality surface water, groundwater, soil, and air. These benefits are expected to be significant, althoughdifficult to estimate in advance of completing the RI/FS at these sites.Associated with the costs are significant potential benefits and cost offsets.The distributional costs to firms of financing NPL remedies have corresponding``benefits'' in that funds expended for a response generate employment,directly or indirectly (through purchased materials).<ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis</ITAG>The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires EPA to review the impactsof this action on small entities, or certify that the action will not havea significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. By smallentities, the Act refers to small businesses, small government jurisdictions,and nonprofit organizations.While this rule proposes revisions to the NCP, they are not typical regulatorychanges since the revisions do not automatically impose costs. Proposingsites on the NPL does not in itself require any action by any private party,nor does it determine the liability of any party for the cost of cleanupat the site. Further, no identifiable groups are affected as a whole. Asa consequence, it is hard to predict impacts on any group. A site's proposedinclusion on the NPL could increase the likelihood that adverse impactsto responsible parties (in the form of cleanup costs) will occur, but EPAcannot identify the potentially affected business at this time nor estimatethe number of small businesses that might be affected.The Agency does expect that certain industries and firms within industriesthat have caused a proportionately high percentage of waste site problemscould be significantly affected by CERCLA actions. However, EPA does notexpect the impacts from the listing of these 10 sites to have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small businesses.In any case, economic impacts would only occur through enforcement andcost-recovery actions, which are taken at EPA's discretion on a site-by-sitebasis. EPA considers many factors when determining what enforcement actionsto take, including not only the firm's contribution to the problem, butalso the firm's ability to pay.The impacts (from cost recovery) on small governments and nonprofit organizationswould be determined on a similar case-by-case basis.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 300</ITAG>Air pollution control, Chemicals, Hazardous materials, Intergovernmentalrelations, Natural resources, Oil pollution, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements, Superfund, Waste treatment and disposal, Water pollutioncontrol, Water supply.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: April 27, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jonathan Z.
