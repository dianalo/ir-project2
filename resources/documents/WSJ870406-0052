But many legislators lately have been reluctant to take on the White House, which currently has the edge in the perennial fight over which branch of government controls arms sales to foreign governments.    As a result, a bill designed to shift the advantage heavily in Congress's favor is languishing on Capitol Hill, even though congressional anger over the Iran arms scandal should be helping it. The problem is that the measure would alter the system and require members of Congress to do something they hate to do: vote on politically sensitive issues -- in this case, arms sales.    &quot;You have no idea how unhappy congressmen are, having to vote on controversial issues,&quot; says Illinois Republican Henry Hyde.    Until lawmakers overcome their reticence, their complaints about losing their former strong voice in arms-sales decisions will have a hollow ring. The proposed bill isn't the answer, but it does offer a starting point if legislators are serious about negotiating what their role should be in this commercial arm of foreign policy.    Congress prefers to pick its fights over individual arms sales. Under the system that has evolved, the White House submits an arms-sale proposal and if lawmakers don't challenge it within 50 days the sale is approved. This system avoids having to vote on politically sensitive sales, such as those to moderate Arab states that usually are opposed by the powerful pro-Israel lobby. Recently Congress, by taking no action, quietly permitted a sale of Bradley Fighting Vehicles to Saudi Arabia.    The tug of war concerns how arms sales are rejected. Congress used to have a big advantage. It could block a sale by mustering a majority of both houses to pass a concurrent resolution, known as a legislative veto, which the White House couldn't overrule.    But in 1983 the Supreme Court declared the legislative veto unconstitutional, giving the president the edge. He can veto congressional rejections of arms sales and Congress needs two-thirds of both chambers to override. Last year, for instance, a proposed sale to Saudi Arabia was rejected 356-62 by the House and 73-22 by the Senate. President Reagan prevailed, however, when the Senate sustained his veto 34-66.    The proposed bill, sponsored by Sen. Joseph Biden (D., Del.) and Rep. Mel Levine (D., Cal.), says Congress must vote to approve certain controversial categories of weapons sales to most nations. This gives Congress a positive, rather than negative role in arms sales.    If the president &quot;is unable to persuade a majority of Congress, there may be sound reason for setting his request aside,&quot; reasons Mr. Levine. Yet a Senate Foreign Relations Committee aide concedes that the bill isn't likely to pass this year. &quot;It isn't clear that we have adequate support to do it,&quot; he says.    The defense-industry lobby sees nothing wrong with the current system. &quot;Congressional oversight is informal and not public and that's probably most appropriate when you're dealing with other sovereign entities,&quot; says Joel Johnson, acting president of the American League for Exports and Security Assistance, a lobby group. He adds that requiring members to vote results in decisions based on political pressure, not national security.    &quot;Every time that Congress votes on anything you can argue that politics is part of it,&quot; says Richard Grimmett, who monitors arms-transfer issues for the Congressional Research Service of the Library of Congress. &quot;But if we have disagreements over any type of policy, people have the right to come to Congress and express their views.&quot;    Because it would require public votes, the Biden-Levine bill would magnify the advantage of the pro-Israel lobby; members of Congress don't like to be on record as voting against Israeli interests. Sales to America's treaty allies and nations that have signed the Camp David accords -- Egypt and Israel -- wouldn't require votes. Thus, the bill effectively would focus attention on sales to other Arab nations and make it easier for the Israel lobby to defeat such sales.    But with the proposal unlikely to pass, members of Congress are looking for a compromise. So far it has been difficult to find a solution that simultaneously increases congressional authority and provides political cover. </TEXT></DOC>
