More than100 units are now operated in seven countries. However, there are onlya little more than 10 cases which exceed the angle of 20 degrees. Coaltechnology Research Institute started investigating since 1985. Enginepart and return part of the mechanical equipment was fabricated by ScharfA.G. of West Germany, and the other parts were self developed. As theelectrical equipment differs much from the European ones, the controlsystem was self developed (Explosion-proof structure). It was installedat Horonai Coal Mine, Hokkaido. Main specifications are as follows: Totallength 261 m. Rope inclination -7 to -30 degrees. Number of transportedpassengers (Hourly 594 on two tracks). Fixed chairs. 55 KW motor. Illuminationinside employs an optical fiber system. The unit was received with reputationof faster transportation and of less fatigue. (8 figs, 2 tabs)</TEXT></DOC>
