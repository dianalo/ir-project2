PostsProfit of $8.1 MillionFor Fiscal 4th Period</HL><DD> 09/03/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> DPTEARNINGS (ERN) </IN><DATELINE> SAN ANTONIO, Texas  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Datapoint Corp., continuing to recover from a string of losses, reported net income of $8.1 million, or 51 cents a share, for the fiscal fourth quarter ended Aug. 1.    A year earlier, the computer and office-automation company earned $231,000, or one cent a share.    Revenue fell 1.7% to $87.6 million from $89.1 million.    Datapoint has been plagued by heavy losses, management changes and waning customer confidence, but it declared that it is &quot;in better shape today than it has been in recent years.&quot;    In an effort to combat losses, the company undertook a massive restructuring program during the second quarter that included the termination of 786 employees' jobs and write-downs totaling about $43.8 million. The reduction of Datapoint's world-wide work force to 2,700 cost the company an additional $13 million in severance pay.    &quot;We believe the two profitable quarters which followed the restructuring have set the scene for bigger and better things, and the outlook for fiscal 1988 is very encouraging,&quot; Doris Bencsik, chief operating officer, said.    The company, 15%-owned by New York investor Asher B. Edelman, said it expects to report an operating profit for its fiscal 1988 first quarter, but didn't elaborate. A year earlier, Datapoint had a net loss of $4.4 million on revenue of $71.3 million.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Datapoint closed at $8.625 a share, up 37.5 cents.    For the fiscal year, Datapoint reported a net loss of $57.8 million, compared with a net loss of $8.6 million a year earlier.    Revenue fell 4% to $312 million from $325 million. </TEXT></DOC>
