But 1989was the roughest year of all.   &quot;I was down 17 percentage points {relative to themarket},&quot; notes the 58-year-old Mr. Neff, shaking his head indisgust. &quot;Never been down that much before.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Neff often sees value where others only see problems,so he's often buying what the crowd is selling. But in 1989he found himself wildly out of touch with the mood of themarket.   &quot;People were giving lip service to a soft landing {for theeconomy}, but they weren't betting on it.&quot; he says. &quot;That'swhat killed us last year.&quot; Although he was up 15%, theStandard andamp; Poor's 500 zoomed past him with a 31.6% totalreturn, which is price change plus dividends.   After lagging behind the market so badly, many investorsmight switch strategy. Not Mr. Neff. He's sticking with thesame strategy that has made him one of the country'spre-eminent fund managers: buying stocks that trade at lowmultiples of corporate earnings.   For him, that currently means betting big-three quartersof Windsor's portfolio -- on cyclical industries such asautos and aluminum and on financial stocks like banks andinsurers.   This year is likely to further test the mettle of Mr.Neff, whose 20.7% annual return for Windsor's investors overthe past decade has comfortably beaten the 17.7% for the Sandamp;P500. With bond yields up, corporate earnings seeminglystalled and leveraged buy-outs moribund, &quot;the froth should beoff&quot; the stock market, says Mr. Neff, who thinks a 15% or 20%market drop is possible.   Mr. Neff's dry spell began in January 1989, when VanguardGroup reopened Windsor to new investors for five months. Some$1.2 billion of new money poured in, flooding him with cashjust as the market was taking off. He entered 1989 with heftypositions in the Big Three auto makers, InternationalBusiness Machines and Telefonica de Espana, all of whichtrailed the market badly in 1989. Worse still was Bank of NewEngland, where problem loans have forced a halt in dividendsand pounded the shares to around $4, well below Windsor's $22average cost.   So far, 1990 hasn't been much kinder. Windsor lost 2.9% inthe first quarter, against a 2.3% loss for the average stockfund. Recently, one of Mr. Neff's favorite thrifts, GoldenWest Financial, was marked down 20% as indiscriminate sellingbeat down the stocks of savings and loans.   &quot;We've been killed before,&quot; recalls Mr. Neff. Windsortrailed the market badly in the early 1970s, as thehighflying &quot;nifty 50&quot; stocks zoomed and Mr. Neff's portfolioplodded. Mr. Neff again lagged behind in 1980, as oil andtechnology stocks soared.   But 1989 was especially bad. The year's big stock marketwinners were companies specializing in beverages, foods,household products, telephones and medical drugs, the sort ofproducts that continue to sell even in a recession. &quot;Thatwasn't high-expectation type of merchandise,&quot; notes Mr. Neff.Nonetheless, these companies, which make up almost a third ofthe Sandamp;P 500, were up 46% last year.   Mr. Neff's portfolio, by contrast, has been heavilyweighted toward the auto makers, financial companies such asinsurers, banks and thrifts and cyclical commodity companiessuch as Lyondell Petrochemical, Alcan Aluminium, BethlehemSteel and International Paper. In part, this reflects Mr.Neff's belief that there will indeed be a &quot;soft landing&quot; forthe economy.   But those sectors are also where Mr. Neff has found hisbargains with low price-earnings multiples, or P/Es. Mr.Neff's portfolio now trades at six times his own estimates of1990 earnings. He notes that his estimates are aggressive,and says the consensus of Wall Street analysts would probablyput his portfolio at 7.5 times estimated 1990 earnings. Buteither way, Mr. Neff's holdings are well below the Sandamp;P 500's14 times estimated 1990 earnings.   Mr. Neff also looks for high dividend yields, and theaverage yield on his holdings is currently 5.7%. In additionto the dividends, Mr. Neff reckons his companies could seeearnings advance 9.9% this year, if his aggressive estimatesprove true.   Even if Mr. Neff's stocks remain mired at their currentlowly P/Es and his estimates prove, say, two percentagepoints too optimistic, his shareholders could still do verynicely. A company that enjoys 8% earnings growth, but staysstuck at the same P/E, would by definition see its stockprice advance 8%.   That, plus the 5.7% yield, translates into a healthy 13.7%annual return. But the big payoff comes if a company'searnings growth garners attention from Wall Street analystsand brokers, who then help shove up the stock price.   Since the start of the year, Mr. Neff has lowered his cashposition. But he still has 16% of Windsor's assets inintermediate-term government bonds, certificates of depositand the corporate IOUs known as commercial paper. Even as hesits on a hunk of cash, Mr. Neff is still bullish onindividual stocks.   Windsor's biggest position is Ford Motor, which earned$9.06 a share last year (after nonrecurring items). Mr. Neffestimates the company should earn between $8 and $9 a sharethis year, despite a poor first quarter. He also thinks thelonger-term outlook for auto makers is anything but grim.   &quot;The Big Three have given up about eight percentage pointsin market penetration {in cars} to the Japanese,&quot; notes Mr.Neff. &quot;In the same time, they've improved their penetrationin trucks by eight percentage points. So what, you say?Trucks are growing a hell of a lot faster than cars.&quot;   Mr. Neff has a hefty stake in Citicorp, the country'sbiggest bank. He is much taken with the bank's consumerbanking business, particularly its credit card operation.&quot;They'll earn $3 a share this year on the consumer side,&quot; heestimates. Mr. Neff reckons that Citicorp's consumer bankingbusiness can grow at 15% to 20% a year, and is worth maybe 10to 12 times its $3 earnings. If his match is right, Citicorp,which closed last Thursday at 24 7/8, is trading for lessthan the value of its consumer banking business.   Overall, Mr. Neff thinks that Citicorp will earn between$4 and $4.50 a share this year, if it's a bad year. (&quot;Itlooks like we'll have a bad year,&quot; he adds.)   Among insurers, Mr. Neff is betting on Cigna, a bigmultiline insurer. Cigna should benefit, he says, as rateincreases are applied to the commercial property and casualtyinsurance policies coming up for renewal over the next 12months.   But what really piqued Mr. Neff's interest was theturnaround at Cigna's group health operation, particularlyits health maintenance organization and its preferredprovider organization, which are attracting corporate clientsanxious to limit burgeoning health costs.   Mr. Neff thinks Cigna should earn between $6 and $7.50this year. &quot;The reason it's so wide is because I don't knowwhat will happen on the catastrophe side,&quot; he explains.   So what will it take for the market's view of Cigna,Citicorp and Ford to coincide with that of John Neff? Forvalue investors like Mr. Neff, that's the irritatingimponderable. &quot;Eventually right wins out,&quot; says Mr. Neff,&quot;but you have to show a little patience in this business.&quot;   Mr. Neff has been managing Windsor, now the country'ssecond-largest stock fund, since 1964. He also runs two otherfunds. One is a mutual fund, $120 million Vanguard High YieldStock Fund, which like Windsor is closed to new investors.Mr. Neff says neither fund is likely to be reopened.   Those who want to invest with Mr. Neff should check outthe third fund he runs, $275 million Gemini II, a closed-endfund that trades on the New York Stock Exchange. Unlike aregular mutual fund, a closed-end issues only a fixed numberof shares, which then trade publicly just like any otherstock, meaning they can trade higher or lower than theper-share portfolio value.   Gemini II is even more peculiar than most closed-ends.It's a so-called dual-purpose fund, which means it has twoclasses of shares outstanding, income shares and capitalshares. The income shareholders get all the dividends thatthe fund collects, while the capital shareholders benefitfrom any capital gains. Taken together, Gemini II's capitaland income shares are trading at a 5% premium to net assetvalue.</TEXT></DOC>
