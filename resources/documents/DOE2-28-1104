Other US laws and regulations applicableto ocean dumping of radioactive waste include the Hazardous MaterialsTransportation Act, The National Environmental Policy Act, The AtomicEnergy Act, and the Energy Reorganization Act, along with internal ordersfor executive departments such as the US DOE. The major internationalagreement on ocean dumping is the Convention of the Prevention of MarinePollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter (London Dumping Convention),which prohibits the disposal of high-level wastes and requires a specialpermit prior to ocean disposal of other wastes. Several internationalorganization focus on radioactive waste management; the InternationalAtomic Energy Agency and the Nuclear Energy Agency are the largest andmost active.
