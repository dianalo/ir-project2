The new law gives the administration the flexibility to exempt military personnel from part or all of the automatic cuts. In a letter to congressional leaders, Mr. Miller said that a complete exemption &quot;is considered to be in the national interest.&quot;    But the exemption for military personnel means that the cuts will fall much more heavily on other portions of the defense budget. The Pentagon has estimated that the Gramm-Rudman law may require a 10.5% cut in non-personnel budget areas. Especially hard hit will be the critical &quot;operations and maintenance&quot; portion of the budget, which provides parts and supplies needed to sustain military operations.    Under the new budget law, automatic cuts of $23 billion will take effect Nov. 20, unless Congress and the White House agree on a package of $23 billion in spending cuts and tax increases before then. Half the automatic cuts will come from the defense budget.    Democrats in Congress had hoped the threat of automatic cuts in defense would force the White House to accept a small tax increase. But administration officials have indicated that the president may be willing to accept defense cuts rather than new taxes. </TEXT></DOC>
