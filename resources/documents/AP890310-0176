DARST</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The global warming trend known as thegreenhouse effect is not yet a confirmed scientific fact, but U.S.energy policy ought to proceed as if it is, an Energy Departmentofficial said Friday.   ``I don't think we ought to get bogged down too much right now ina public discussion of scientific aspects of the greenhouseeffect,'' said Donna Fitzpatrick, undersecretary of energy. ``Itseems to me there is plenty of room for public money and publicenergy to put into things we should be doing anyway.''   Ms. Fitzpatrick appeared on a panel on environmental problems ata convention sponsored by the Consumer Federation of America. Sheargued, ``There is no undisputed and settled consensus in thescientific community about whether the greenhouse effect isoccuring,'' which she called ``an open question.''   The greenhouse effect is the predicted warming of the earth byincreasing amounts of heat trapped by man-made gases, like carbondioxide, which are produced by the burning of fossil fuels.   Scientists generally agree the earth has warmed about 0.9 degreesFahrenheit over the last century, which most of them attribute tothe buildup of these gases.   Ms. Fitzpatrick said the temperature buildup ``doesn't match whatwe should have seen because of the greenhouse effect,'' since therewas a pronounced cooling trend in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s.   In any case, she sketched some policy priorities which she saidthe most fervent environmentalists and believers in the greenhouseeffect could agree with: ``energy efficiency, switching totechnologies which don't require the use of fossil fuels such asrenewable technologies which are now just beginning to have thereliability and economy we need,'' and one that environmentalistsgenerally oppose, improved nuclear power.   ``We need to do these things anyway. We should do them. We shouldnot be wasting energy, being inefficient in its use, even if wedidn't think we have a greenhouse effect, and because use of fossilfuels has other environmental hazards besides the greenhouseeffect,'' she said.   Among those hazards, which she did not spell out, can be thepollutants that form acid rain.   Her companion on the panel was James MacKenzie, a researcher atthe World Resources Institute, an environmental policy researchorganization that has argued vigorously that the greenhouse effectis in progress.   ``According to the National Academy of Sciences, which reportedto President Bush as soon as he took over, the greenhouse effect isthe best-understood problem in atmospheric science,'' MacKenzie said.   ``The uncertainties are timing and the impact of when theseeffects are going to happen. There is no uncertainty these gases arebuilding up in the atmosphere and that they trap radiative heat.''   MacKenzie endorsed an efficiency-first strategy.   ``The fact is, the most readily available source now isefficiency, which we could tap in our buildings. We are not doingthat,'' he said.   ``There are several major studies being completed which showelectricity growth could be held to zero for several decades throughthe use of more efficent lighting and motors, at far less than thecost of producing new power plants. The problem is in ourinstitutions; it's not in our technology. The stuff is available,''he said.   Academy panels have predicted an average warming of three toeight degrees sometime in the middle of the next century. Somecomputer models say this warming could occur as early as 2030;others say as late as 2080.   Ms. Fitzpatrick was assistant secretary for conservation andrenewable energy sources before last August, when she becameundersecretary, the No. 3 position in the department.</TEXT></DOC>
