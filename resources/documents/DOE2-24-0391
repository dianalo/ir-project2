ZSM-5, silicate ALPO{sub 4}-n and Phillipsitewere identified as products except other four unidentified products.About 250 kinds of X-ray diffraction patterns for natural and syntheticzeolites and other materials were compiled for the reference data-basewith a personal computer. Product solids were characterized by measuringthe absorption capacity with steam, benzene, cyclohexane, tetrachloromethaneand methanol and catalytic activities were also examined for the alcohols-conversionusing a pulse micro reactor. ALPO{sub 4}-5 was found to be very activein the dehydration reaction, and methanol was selectively converted todimethylether, and ethanol to ethylene and diethylether. Therefore, thecatalytic potential of H{sup +}ZSM-5 applying the methanol to gasolineprocess was promoted significantly, when the ALPO4-5 was placed in theupper stream of the reaction line.
