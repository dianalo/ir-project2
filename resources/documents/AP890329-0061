They surrendered and freed their hostages _including a Hungarian diplomat _ after the plane landed inFrankfurt.   No injuries were reported among the 10 passengers and at leastfour crew members aboard the hijacked Hungarian plane when itreached Frankfurt, officials said.   The hijackers released 82 passengers at Prague airport afterspeaking with Lajos Taba, the Hungarian consul-general, theHungarian news agency MTI said. It said Taba traded himself for thepassengers and was among those freed in Frankfurt.   The gunmen surrendered less than three hours after seizing theSoviet-made Tupolev-154 owned by Hungary's Malev Airlines.   MTI said the hijackers demanded to be taken to the UnitedStates, but West German officials said the gunmen's motives werenot known.   The hijackers, who were armed with guns and carried a fake handgrenade, gave up at Frankfurt Airport when U.S. officials preventedthe plane from taxiing onto adjoining U.S. military base.   A witness said a policeman collapsed during a shootout at Pragueairport when the hijackers took a hostage and forced their way ontothe aircraft.   Hans Neitze, chief spokesman for Frankfurt police, said: ``Wefound the emptied casing of a bullet, and we assume that there wasat least one shot fired on the aircraft.'' He offered no furtherdetails.   Criminal investigator Roland Desch said the hijackers initiallydemanded to be flown ``overseas'' but were convinced by theairliner's crew that the plane could not fly that far. The planethen went to Frankfurt.   ``As far as I know, all passengers are safe. It ended withoutbloodshed,'' airport spokesman Hans Rainer Otto said. Frankfurtpolice spokesman Karl-Heinz Wagner also said there were no injuriesamong those aboard the plane.   Wagner said the youths were Czechoslovak citizens aged 15 and 16.   ``We still don't know what their motive was,'' Wagner said,adding the two youths were being questioned by police. He said thehijackers were armed with a sawed-off shotgun and a rifle andcarried a fake grenade.   Wolfgang Schwalm, a spokesman at Frankfurt airport, said thehijackers gave up after officials refused to accept them at theU.S. Air Force's Rhein-Main Base, which is located at the airport.U.S. officials confirmed that.   ``The pair wanted to go to the American side of the airport,''he told reporters. ``The Americans declined accepting them, and atthat point the hijackers gave up.'' Desch said a military truck wasdriven onto the tarmac to prevent the jet from reaching the U.S.base.   A U.S. Air Force spokesman, Eberhard Bock, said the jet washalted on the taxiway.   ``Two men got off the plane and they were held by U.S. militarysecurity police until the German police arrived and took over,''Bock said.   The jet had been en route to Amsterdam, said Hungarian radio,which was monitored in Budapest. It did not say where the flightoriginated.   Witnesses at Prague's airport said two hijackers forced theirway into the VIP lounge and took a female airport employee hostage.   They then broke the glass wall of the airport building to getonto the tarmac where they aimed their guns at a policeman, saidthe witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity.   There was shooting and the policeman collapsed, but it was notclear whether he had been shot, the witnesses said. The two menforced their way onto the plane but left their hostage behind, thewitnesses said.</TEXT></DOC>
