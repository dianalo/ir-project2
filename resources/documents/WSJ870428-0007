The Japan Iron and Steel Federation said that steel exports fell 0.7% in March from a year earlier, to 2.4 million metric tons, and 7% in the fiscal year ended March 31, to 29.8 million tons.    Federations officials ascribed March's decline to slumping demand in the Mideast and Southeast Asia. Both areas have been hurt by weak prices for commodities; the fall in exports to the two areas outpaced an increase in shipments to China and the U.S., Japan's two biggest foreign steel markets.    In the fiscal year, the officials said, exports were hurt by curbs on steel shipments to the U.S.; the strong yen, which raises the cost of Japanese exports; and weak purchasing power in the Mideast.    In a separate report, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association said exports of cars, trucks and buses fell 2.7% in March from a year earlier, to 444,975 units and 3.8% in the fiscal year, to 6.6 million units. The decline during the 12 months was the first in four years.    Officials of the association said shipments remained weak because of the yen's strength and curbs on exports to the U.S. and the European Community.    Meanwhile, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said production at Japan's factories and mines increased 0.9% in March from a year earlier and a seasonally adjusted 0.7% from February. Industrial production has increased every month since last December.    Despite the increase, ministry officials remained cautious and said they believed industrial output -- which, like Japanese exports, has been hurt by the rising currency -- remained sluggish. &quot;We expect it to show a decline in April and only a slight increase in May,&quot; one official said. &quot;There are still uncertainties about which way the demand is going, and we have to see more statistics before we can say anything more definite.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
