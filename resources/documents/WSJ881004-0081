Carbon dioxide emission from power plants and other sources is a culprit in the suspected rapid warming of the earth's atmosphere, the so-called greenhouse effect. At a test plant in South Dakota, Argonne captured a power plant's waste gasesmostly unburned carbon and sulfur. Then it enriched the gases with oxygen and burned the mixture in the plant's boiler, producing highly-concentrated carbon dioxide.    Argonne, located in Argonne, Ill., believes the carbon dioxide concentration is high enough for the gas to be economically transported by pipeline over long distances and sold to the soft-drink, refrigeration, grain storage and other industries. Currently, these industries depend on natural reservoirs of the gas, which generally are found only around oil fields. Of course, the more carbon dioxide recovered from industrial plant combustion, the less that escapes into the atmosphere.    The new technology isn't a panacea. Argonne says the process is economically viable only if oil is selling for at least $25 a barrel, compared with crude's current price of about $12 a barrel. What's more, the new technology doesn't solve the problem of what to do with the sulfur dioxide emitted by a power plant -- the chief culprit in the acid-rain pollution problem.    An Energy Department spokesman says the sulfur dioxide might be simultaneously recoverable through the use of powdered limestone, which tends to absorb the sulfur. The Argonne project wasn't intended to demonstrate that, however, he adds.    The Argonne research is just one of several clean-coal demonstration projects being supported by the federal Energy Department. Most of the others are intended to reduce or eliminate the sulfur-dioxide emissions problems.    Last week, the Energy Department announced that 16 such projects would receive $537 million in federal funding, to go along with $800 million of proposed private-sector funding.    The electric-utility industry is working hard to develop clean-coal technologies that could forestall costly federal legislation requiring utilities to fit power plants with equipment, called scrubbers, for removing the hazardous gases from plant emissions. </TEXT></DOC>
