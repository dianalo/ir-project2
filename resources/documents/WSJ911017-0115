This year's show, starting Monday in Las Vegas, isexpected to be bigger.</LP><TEXT>   In fact, to a small but growing bunch of exhibitors,Comdex is getting too big. Feeling unable to be heard abovethe cacophony of vendors hawking their wares, some are evenopting to spend their exhibit dollars at smaller, morefocused shows. Among those not exhibiting at this year's showis Compaq Computer Corp., and that, insiders say, will signalothers that they need not exhibit either.   &quot;I think Comdex has hit the slippery slope,&quot; says PaulGillin, executive editor of Computerworld, an industry tradepaper. &quot;It's so big that it's impossible to get anythingdone.&quot;   But others insist that Comdex can't be replaced. Howevercrowded it becomes, they argue, it is the computer industry'scentral meeting place. &quot;It got too big years ago, but it'sstill the place to be. You still have to go,&quot; says EstherDyson, editor of Release 1.0, an industry newsletter.   Moreover, Sheldon Adelson, the chairman and chiefexecutive of Interface Group Inc. and the founder of Comdex,has made some changes to quell the discontent. Primarily, hehas created two minitrade shows, grouping multimediaexhibitors and networking exhibitors together within the bigshow to create an air of intimacy. Some say the concept ishelping. The multimedia show, for example, lured Tandy Corp.,which hadn't exhibited at Comdex for years.   For others, though, the fear of disappearing in theswirling masses has grown larger. Compounding that fear isthe trade show's steep cost of about $39 a square foot, orabout $7,800 for a 200-square-foot space. And spacerepresents only about 15% of a company's total cost, whichincludes displays and entertainment. Further, some criticsfeel Mr. Adelson hasn't taken seriously their complaintsabout long waits for food and to see exhibits. In its previewpublication, for example, the Interface Group's advice toshow goers include: &quot;Don't do what the crowds are doing&quot; and&quot;When you see a long line, avoid it.&quot;   Compaq avoided the crowds by exhibiting at this week'sNetWorld show in Dallas instead, where the organizers charge$31 per square foot for booths. Compaq had a number ofnetworking products to introduce, and the company figured itwould get more attention at a show targeted to users of thoseproducts. &quot;We analyzed it and concluded it morecost-effective to spend money on a more focused show likeNetWorld,&quot; says Joseph Canion, president and chief executiveof Compaq.   Banyan Systems Inc., a networking company, went the sameroute. &quot;We can be at Comdex and get lost or dominate atNetWorld,&quot; says James D'Arezzo, Banyan's vice president ofmarketing. BASF Information Systems, a division of BASF Corp.that makes computer storage products, also opted to drop outof Comdex last year, after having exhibited at the show sinceits start more than 10 years ago.   BASF won't be at this year's Comdex either, but thecompany doesn't bypass the show altogether. &quot;We know who wewant to talk to so it's more efficient for us to get a suitein one of the hotels&quot; than a booth on the floor, says SigTullmann, BASF director of marketing.   &quot;People are looking for an easier trade show,&quot; says AdamTorres, vice president of rival NetWorld. He compares Comdexto a restaurant that became so popular &quot;nobody went anymore.&quot;By offering a trade show with more focus toward users of theproducts, rather than dealers, NetWorld says it can help its300 exhibitors get more attention for their products thanComdex can offer with its networking minishow.   Mr. Adelson says the Interface Group has been surveyingComdex exhibitors for months to hear their problems andaddress their concerns. Out of that effort came theminiconferences. Further, the show is evolving into anindustrywide get-together for manufacturers, dealers andusers from its origins as a place where manufacturers signedup dealers. &quot;This year we're developing program seminars forthe user community,&quot; Mr. Adelson says.   Complaints about Comdex also concern prices for food andcatering. The Comdex caterers at the convention, for example,charge companies $80 for a pitcher of orange juice; hot dogsand hamburgers cost about $5 apiece. Mr. Adelson says hemakes no profit from food concessions, which are run byindependent operators.   Because Interface is private, revenue and earningsestimates aren't available, although it is widely understoodthat Comdex is highly profitable. Says Mr. Adelson: &quot;I don'tapologize for making Comdex a success.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
