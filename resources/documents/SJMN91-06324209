I call oneveryone to become merchants.&quot;;   Mayor's plans blocked;   Although MoscowMayor Gavriil Popov also backs radical reforms, many of his projects havefoundered, blocked either by red tape, bureaucratic resistance, battles in thecity council or philosophical arguments over the fairest way to sell or giveaway state-owned property.;   Now, with Russian federation President BorisYeltsin's economic reforms getting under way and the state about to lift itscontrol over prices, making them likely to rocket upward within weeks, Moscowhas been forced to move.;   If successful, its privatization plan could serveas a model for other cities.;   If it fails, or &quot;if we're slow with thisreform, the people will take to the streets because of the lack of goods onthe shelves,&quot; Piyasheva said.;   Simple principles;   The principles ofMoscow's retail privatization, she said, are &quot;maximally simple.&quot;;   Under herplan, workers in every store, restaurant or service establishment will receivetwo weeks to decide whether they want to buy their workplace at a reasonableprice. The price will be determined by calculating the depreciated cost of thefirm's equipment, then adding in the value of its current funds and 500 rubles-- $300, according to the commercial rate of exchange -- for each square yardof building space.;   If 51 percent of a firm's workers opt for the buyout,they effectively become its owners as soon as they inform the city of theirdecision.;   If the majority votes against the buyout, the establishment goesup for auction, with all interested buyers, including foreigners, invited.;  From the moment a collective declares its intention to buy its business, &quot;Noone can take it away from you,&quot; Piyasheva said.;   &quot;The right to property is asacred right,&quot; she said, in a forceful contradiction of more than 70 years ofCommunist Party ideology aimed at rooting out all instincts of privateownership -- and entrepreneurship. &quot;It's a primary right, the most importantright.&quot;;   Piyasheva said she plans to have privatized all of the city's smallstores and service industries by Jan. 1.;   The plan has the support of Popov,and, indirectly, of Yeltsin, Piyasheva said. But doubts remain whether it willrun into opposition from the contentious deputies of the Moscow City Council.It is due to come before the Moscow government today for final approval.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Los Angeles Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Moscow  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911119  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  November  </MONTH><PG.COL>  8A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  498  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday, November 19, 199100324209,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
