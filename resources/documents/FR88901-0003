Preparing and executing separate Contracts of Guaranty is a cumbersomerepetitive process, the purpose of which can be equally well served bypublishing a standard rule. Once the rule (i.e., terms and conditions ofA.I.D.'s guaranty) is published, a simple cross reference to the CFR rulein the guaranty legend signed on the reverse side of each guarantied notewill suffice to advise noteholders of their contractual rights againstA.I.D. as guarantor.A proposed rule on this subject was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on April 11, 1988, at FR 11872. The final datefor receipt of comments was May 11, 1988. The final rule now publishedreflects technical changes resulting from comments received, but no substantivecomments were received.The rulemaking document is not subject to rulemaking under 5 U.S.C. 553or to regulatory analysis under Executive Order 12291 because it involvesa foreign affairs function of the United States.As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act, it is hereby certified thatthis proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities. The provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act(44 U.S.C. 3501-3520) (1982) do not apply.
