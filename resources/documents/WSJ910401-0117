Pete Wilson willmeet with state legislators this week in an attempt to tacklea state budget deficit ballooning out of control.   On Friday, the governor disclosed that California'sdeficit is nearly twice as large as he projected in January,and now approaches $13 billion, or nearly 25% of the entirestate yearly budget. He said the state's fiscal mess hadreached &quot;emergency proportions&quot; and that &quot;painful cuts&quot; wouldbe needed immediately.</LP><TEXT>   The recession has caused a sharp, unexpected drop inrevenue, especially in bank, corporate and sales taxes. Thestate treasurer's office has reported that revenue collectedin March is likely to be $500 million less than expected. Thegovernor said the size of the problem &quot;is difficult for mostof us to comprehend.&quot;   Gov. Wilson, a Republican, has called on the legislatureto submit proposals for balancing the budget by April 11. Hewants a budget approved by May 1, two months before thefiscal year begins.   California, the eighth-largest economy in the world, isstruggling to deal with the largest deficit ever faced by astate in dollar terms. But it isn't alone; 27 other statesare operating with deficits, and their efforts to cutspending and raise taxes are seen as adding to the pressuresdelaying a recovery from national recession.   Although first-term Gov. Wilson has enjoyed betterrelations with the Democrat-controlled legislature than hispredecessor, the worsening deficit crisis could set the stagefor the kind of political deadlock that has typified statebudget proceedings in recent years.   Gov. Wilson opposes the idea, suggested by Democrats, ofincreasing income taxes for wealthy state residents, and heobjects to corporate tax increases, saying they maydiscourage business in California. His previous budgetproposal called for $1.77 billion in new revenue, coming fromcollege tuition rises, higher license fees, and taxes onalcohol, candy and newspapers.   &quot;Raising personal and business taxes won't help,&quot; said aspokeswoman for the state's Department of Finance. &quot;It's astructural problem. The service side of the budget is out ofcontrol.&quot;   State revenue has grown 63% in the past six years, shesaid. In the same time period, expenditures for prisons havegrown nearly 200%; medical expenditures have grown 124% andwelfare spending has grown 116%. She said personal incometaxes would have to be raised more than 50% in order to wipeout a deficit of this size. &quot;This issue needs long-termstructural reform,&quot; she said.   The gap between state revenue and spending for the rest ofthis fiscal year and the next fiscal year is expected to be$12.6 billion. For the current fiscal year, ending June 30,California is likely to come up $3.5 billion short.   When Gov. Wilson unveiled his original budget in January,it was criticized for putting too much of the burden on theneedy. That budget, however, was based on projections of a $7billion deficit. With news that the deficit has nearlydoubled, cuts will be much deeper.   Schools have already been targeted for cuts of about $2billion, a move opposed by Assembly Speaker Willie Brown,among others. California's school age population is growing50% faster than the general population.   The number of people receiving services under stateprograms &quot;continues to outpace even our relentless populationincrease,&quot; the governor said. California added about sixmillion more people in the last decade, and now has about 30million residents.</TEXT></DOC>
