Theproposed action would authorize continued operation of the reactor in themanner that it has been operated since License No. R-87 was issued in 1962.Currently there are no plans to change any of the structures or operatingcharacteristics associated with the reactor during the renewal period requestedby the licensee.Need for the Proposed ActionThe operating license for the facility was due to expire in August 1986.The proposed action is required to authorize continued operation so thatthe facility can continue to be used in the licensee's mission of educationand research.Alternatives to the Proposed ActionThe only renewable alternative to the proposed action that was consideredwas not renewing the operating license. This alternative would have ledto cessation of operations, with a resulting change in status and a likelysmall impact on the environment.Environmental ImpactThe PUR operates in an existing shielded pool of water inside an existingmultiple-purpose building, so this licensing action would lead to no changein the physical environment.Based on the review of the specific facility operating characteristicsthat are considered for potential impact on the environment, as set forthin the staff's Safety Evaluation Report (SER) \1\<NOTE/> for this action, it is concluded that renewal of this operatinglicense will have an insignificant environmental impact. Although judgedinsignificant, operating features with the greatest potential environmentalimpact are summarized below.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ NUREG-1283, ``Safety Evaluation Report Related to theRenewal of the Operating License for the Research Reactor at Purdue University.''Argon-41, a product from nuetron irradiation of air during operation, isthe principal airborne radioactive effluent from the PUR during routineoperations. Conservative calculations by the staff, based on the totalamount of Ar-41 released from the reactor during a year, predict a maximumpotential annual whole body dose of less than 1 millirem in unrestrictedareas. Radiation exposure rates measured outside of the reactor facilitybuilding are consistent with this computation.The staff has considered hypothetical credible accidents at the PUR andhas concluded that there is reasonable assurance that such accidents willnot release a significant quantity of fission products from the fuel claddingand, therefore, will not cause significant radiological hazard to the environmentor the public.This conclusion is based on the following:(a) The excess reactivity available under the technical specificationsis insufficient to support a reactor transient generating enough energyto cause overheating of the fuel or loss of integrity of the cladding.(b) At a thermal power level of 1000 watts, the inventory of fission productsin the fuel cannot generate sufficient radioactive decay heat to causefuel damage even in the hypothetical event of instantaneous total lossof coolant, and(c) The hypothetical loss of integrity of the maximum irradiated fueledexperiment will not lead to radiation exposures in the unrestricted environmentthat exceed guideline values of 10 CFR Part 20.In addition to the analyses in the SER summarized above, the environmentalimpact associated with operation of research reactors has been genericallyevaluated by the staff and is discussed in the attached generic evaluation.This evaluation concludes that there will be no significant environmentalimpact associated with the operation of research reactors licensed to operateat power levels up to and including 2 MW(t) and that an Environmental ImpactStatement is not required for the issuance of construction permits or operatinglicenses for such facilities. We have determined that this generic evaluationis applicable to operation of the PUR and that there are no special orunique features that would preclude reliance on the generic evaluation.Alternative Use of ResourcesThis action does not involve the use of any resources beyond those normallyallocated for such activities.Agencies and Persons ConsultedThe staff has obtained the technical assistance of the Idaho National EngineeringLaboratory in performing the safety evaluation of continued operation ofthe PUR facility.Conclusion and Basis for Finding of No Significant Environmental ImpactBased on the foregoing Environmental Assessment, the Commission has concludedthat the proposed action would not have a significant effect on the qualityof the human environment. Accordingly, the Commission has determined notto prepare an Environmental Impact Statement for this proposed action.For further details with respect to this action, see the licensee's requestfor a license amendment dated June 30, 1986, as supplemented.
