The venture will make and market CATV fiber-optic cables, CATV coaxial cables and computer LAN cables. The transaction is expected to close in September.    The venture will combine the coaxial cable business of General Instrument's Comm/Scope subsidiary with Alcatel's fiber-optic technology. Alcatel's U.S. unit, Alcatel NA, will become a minority shareholder of the new company.    General Instrument will recapitalize the Comm/Scope subsidiary, and will receive $70 million in cash and a $110 million convertible note. Conversion of the note will give General Instrument a majority equity interest in the subsidiary. Certain members of the Comm/Scope management also will purchase a minority interest.    General Instrument has interests in cable-TV electronics, coaxial cable and satellite encryption systems. Alcatel N.V. is a joint venture of the French group Cie. Generale d'Electricitie and ITT Corp., New York. </TEXT></DOC>
