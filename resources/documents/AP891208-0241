Thornburgh announced Thursday that the additional prosecutors,FBI agents and accountants will be assigned to 27 cities where mostof the savings and loan fraud cases are being investigated.   The additional manpower is being financed by a $48.5 millionappropriation by Congress as part of legislation to tightenregulations on the scandal-plagued thrift industry.   ``Wrongdoing in the savings and loan industry may turn out to bethe biggest white-collar swindle in the history of our nation,''the attorney general told reporters.   The department's Dallas savings and loan task force, which hasalready obtained 46 convictions, will double in size with 37 moreFBI agents and 12 assistant U.S. attorneys, Thornburgh said.   Asked today on ABC's ``Good Morning America'' to what extentblame for Sandamp;L fraud could be placed on deregulation of theindustry, Thornburgh said, ``I think the type of operator that wasinvolved in these ripoffs would have not been deterred by theregulatory apparatus.''   He said ``the best estimates are that about 25 percent, onedollar out of four, of the losses that eventually are going to haveto be picked up by the taxpayers was due to criminal activity.''Overall losses in the Sandamp;L industry have been estimated at up to$160 billion.   ``I think it would be misleading to think that there will be anysubstantial recovery,'' Thornburgh said. ``Most of these funds havebeen frittered away.''   Marvin Collins, U.S. attorney in Dallas, said much of the fraudin the Texas Sandamp;L industry would have happened anyway. ``The cowboyswe prosecuted were going to act without regard to whether there wasregulation,'' Collins said.   The Justice Department is pursuing about 8,000 cases of bank andsavings-and-loan fraud, ranging from embezzlements by tellers tofraud committed by top executives, said Justice Departmentspokesman David Runkel.   ``If laws are firmly enforced, they will provide a deterrent tofuture criminal activity,'' the attorney general said.   ``Up to this point, because of the number of cases and theshortage of resources, we have not been able to mount the type ofeffort I have outlined,'' he said.   In addition to Dallas, Thornburgh announced the assignment of 27FBI agents and 15 more prosecutors to Los Angeles, 10 FBI agentsand five prosecutors to Kansas City, 12 agents and five prosecutorsto New Orleans, 10 FBI agents and four prosecutors to OklahomaCity, and 10 agents and four prosecutors to New York.   Another 27 agents and 14 prosecutors will be assigned to Houston.   Additional investigators and prosecutors will be assigned to:Anchorage, Alaska; Atlanta; Boston; Chicago; Cleveland; Denver; ElPaso, Texas; Little Rock, Ark.; Memphis, Tenn.; Miami; Minneapolis;Newark, N.J.; Omaha, Neb.; Philadelphia; Phoenix; Sacramento,Calif.; San Antonio; San Francisco; Seattle and Tampa, Fla.</TEXT></DOC>
