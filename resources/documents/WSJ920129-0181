Lately, they havebegun to do something about it.   Daimler-Benz AG Chairman Edzard Reuter, the urbane seniorstatesman of German industry, bluntly sets the tone. &quot;Theoverwhelming majority of German business leaders are thinkingseriously about whether impending investments wouldn't bemore sensibly placed abroad&quot; in more cost-effectivecountries, he told publishers in Dusseldorf this month.</LP><TEXT>   Indeed, Daimler-Benz recently started obtaining dieselengines and auto parts from foreign sources at half theGerman cost. The company not only isn't likely to build anymore major plants in Germany but also wishes it could reverseits decision to locate its newest car plant, due to becompleted this year, in Rastatt, Germany. It is evenconsidering producing Mercedes cars in Mexico and Russia.   Robert Bosch G.m.b.H. last year decided to cut at least500 jobs by closing a German plant and transferring itsproduction of car stereo speakers to Malaysia. Bosch has alsotransferred much of its production of cassette-playercomponents to Mexico and gas gauges to Portugal and Turkey,and it recently began producing generators in Wales.   Of the 51 billion marks ($32 billion) that Volkswagen AGplans to invest by 1996, more than half will flow out ofGermany for the first time and into low-cost production sitesin Portugal, Spain, Mexico, China and Czechoslovakia. SiemensAG is shifting some of its basic production into EasternEurope and Turkey.   The list keeps growing. German industry groups estimatethat jobs are being exported at a rate of more than 100,000 ayear, and that doesn't take into account foreign companiesthat may be bypassing Germany in favor of lower-cost Europeanlocations. If production continues to move abroad, Germany'straditional trade surpluses could soon disappear.   German executives maintain that costs are often thedriving motive for pulling out of Germany. What it all addsup to is that Germany is becoming less attractive as amanufacturing base at the same time other European countriessuch as Spain and Portugal are improving their productivityand industrial infrastructures. The flight of capital exportsGerman jobs and diminishes Germany's potential futureeconomic growth and tax base. For Eastern Europe and SouthernEurope, Germany's loss is their gain.   In 1990 German companies invested a net 29.8 billion marksabroad, nearly three times the 1988 capital outflow, whilenet foreign capital investments in Germany totaled 2.9billion marks. The gap continued to widen in 1991.   From 1981 to 1989, Germany drew $14 billion in investmentsfrom other Group of Seven industrial nations. By contrast,France and Italy each pulled in $36 billion and Britain awhopping $80 billion.   &quot;What is truly disturbing is that at a time when we needall the foreign capital we can get after unity with the East,we're getting only a tenth of what we are sending abroad,&quot;says Ottheinrich von Weitershausen of the Federal Employers'Association, a leading industry group.   Taken together, the disincentives for investing in Germanyappear formidable.   German labor costs already are the highest in the world,and labor unions are threatening to try to increase them thisyear. At the end of 1990, the average German worker cost37.88 marks ($23.50) an hour in wages and benefits, roughly50% higher than average labor costs in the U.S., Japan,Britain and France, and five times the wages and benefits ofPortugese workers. By 1995, the average working week inGermany is contractually set to drift down to 35 hours a weekfrom 37.5 hours currently. German workers already spend fewerhours on the job than their counterparts in any of the otherGroup of Seven countries.   Germany has lagged behind reductions in corporate taxessince the late 1980s. At an average 50%, rates at whichcorporate profits are taxed are half again as high as thosein the U.S., Japan and France.   German companies also pay more for energy, for example 20%to 40% more for electricity than competitors in the EuropeanCommunity. Chemical maker BASF would have saved 100 millionmarks on its power bill last year if it were paying Frenchrates. Costs associated with environmental protection are 60%higher in Germany than the EC average, particularly affectingsmokestack industries strapped with some of the tightestenvironmental legislation anywhere.   Companies that can't easily move abroad are trimming staffin basic production, where profit margins are more sensitiveto production costs. Fried. Krupp G.m.b.H. plans to cut10,000 jobs after its proposed merger with Hoesch AG, anothersteel and engineering group. Thyssen AG, the diversifiedindustry group, is trimming 10,000 jobs, too.   The high cost of doing business has been a recurringgrievance for German manufacturers, a few of which startedshifting production to cheaper sites in the mid-1980s. Butthese days the rhetoric has a sharper edge. The EuropeanCommunity's single market looms after this year, and othercountries are moving to reduce their production costs even asthe German cost problem is growing worse.   The exodus of jobs from Germany worries German policymakers, who are furiously trying to talk militant tradeunions out of demanding another round of major pay raises andmore time off. German unions are threatening to strike forwage increases of 10% this year after receiving 7% in 1991.   Labor leaders show little inclination to moderate theirdemands, dismissing predictions of an economic slowdown as&quot;propaganda.&quot; But Germany's business leaders argue that theunions' stance could become self-defeating.</TEXT></DOC>
