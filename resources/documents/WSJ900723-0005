That's about to change.   Kimberly-Clark Corp. hopes to blow some life into thestaid market with its new Kleenex-brand toilet tissue. Theimmediate impact of the entry last week, according toindustry analysts, could be a fierce round of couponing andprice-cutting. That could enliven what has been a rathersleepy quest for market share and at least temporarily endthe regular price increases tissue makers have been able topush through in the past three years.</LP><TEXT>   The new tissue -- made with a blow-dry process the companyclaims will produce a softer, Kleenex-like tissue -- willcompete head-on with Pandamp;G's White Cloud and Charmin, themarket segment leaders with a combined 30% of the $2.9billion consumer market; Scott Paper Co.'s Cottonelle andScott brands; and James River Corp.'s Northern brand.   But Kimberly-Clark's re-entry into a market it onceabandoned represents a risky thrust into a business withoutper-capita consumption growth. &quot;It's not an easy market,&quot;said George Adler, an analyst for Smith Barney, Harris Uphamandamp; Co.   However, he noted, Kimberly-Clark has a weapon: thewell-regarded sales force that helped put the company on theconsumer products map with its Huggies disposable diapers andKleenex facial tissues. &quot;They'll get their product on theshelves,&quot; said Mr. Adler.   Kimberly-Clark all but abandoned the bathroom-tissuemarket in 1984, when it quit making Kleenex Boutique bathroomtissue so that it could devote more of its paper-makingcapacity to facial tissues and household paper towels, aspokeswoman said. The company's Kleenex brand facial tissue,for example, is the market leader, with 40% of sales.   Technically, Kimberly-Clark never left the bathroom-tissuemarket. For the past six years, the company has continued tosell its Delsey brand, which holds just 0.1% of the market atthe economy end. That segment, consisting mostly ofprivate-label, generic and institutional brands, has shrunkto 16.8% of overall bathroom-tissue sales from 18.7% since1985, while premium bathroom tissues' share jumped to 62%from 54.4%.   Still, knocking heads with Pandamp;G at the top end of themarket won't be easy. In a business that is growing only asmuch as the population grows, any increase in market sharewill have to come either from customers abandoning economybrands or by chipping away at competitors' shares.   But few analysts are willing to dismiss Kimberly-Clark'schances just yet. In recent years, the onetime bulk paperproducer has shown an increasing knack for marketing consumerproducts. In the mid-1970s, the company's Kimbies branddisposable diapers were languishing, and company officialstoyed with dropping the product entirely as Pandamp;G's Pamperspulled ahead. Instead, Kimberly-Clark came back in 1978 witha new brand that featured the catchy Huggies name, animproved shape and more absorbent filling. And the companybacked it with heavy marketing support. Today, Huggies holds31% of the throw-away diaper market, compared with Pampers's26%.   Kimberly-Clark is expected to spend $25 million to $50million to introduce its Kleenex brand, stressing theproduct's softness, an image enhanced by the well-known brandname. The &quot;through-dried&quot; process of blow-drying the tissueproduces a softer finish than the roll driers typically usedto remove the water used in papermaking, the company claims.   But it's doubtful that Pandamp;G will yield any bragging rightson whose tissue is more squeezably soft. &quot;We are verycommitted to this category as an important business for us,and Pandamp;G will continue to lead in the market and grow in thecategory,&quot; a Pandamp;G spokesman said. He declined to indicate whatsteps the company would take to defend its market position,which garners about $750 million in annual sales.   Analysts expect the battle will initially be confined tothe south and central U.S., where Kimberly-Clark isintroducing its product. But it will be fierce. &quot;WhenKimberly-Clark moves into this market, Pandamp;G and James Riverand Scott are all going to try to cut them off at the knees,&quot;said Bruce Kirk at S.G. Warburg andamp; Co.   More extensive couponing and perhaps even out-and-outprice-cutting are possible tactics in the battle. Mr. Kirkexpects increased price promotions, such asthree-for-the-price-of-two bargain packs. Also, the annualprice increases of recent years may grind to a halt, at leastuntil the market shakes out, analysts said.   Initially, Kimberly-Clark's market incursion will belimited by its production capacity, said Brenda Lee Landry,analyst for Morgan Stanley Co. The company's new Jenks,Okla., plant, which has been built to produce the toiletpaper, can satisfy only about 5% of the market. &quot;If they takemarket share from Pandamp;G, it would only be about 1% or 2%,&quot; Ms.Landry extrapolated, until the company commits more plants tothe effort.   The introduction of Kleenex bathroom tissue, analystssaid, seems to be part of a more aggressive strategy ofnew-product development. The company announced Wednesday, forinstance, that it will begin marketing Huggies brand babywipes, an extension of its Huggies disposable-diaper line.The new baby wipes will compete with top brands made by Scottand by Sterling Drug Inc., a unit of Eastman Kodak Co., andJohnson andamp; Johnson.   In the past, they said, the company has been loath toventure into smaller markets, such as the $350 millionbaby-wipes business. Now, it seems more willing to enterthose markets, using them to extend families of products thatbear the same brand name.</TEXT></DOC>
