Shultz's visit.   Underground leaders of the uprising threaten to burn Arab storesif they don't observe general strikes, such as the three-day workstoppage ordered to protest Shultz's visit to Israel on Sunday.   At the same time, the Israeli government uses taxes as one of itsmajor weapons for fighting the uprising.   ``If I open, they will burn it,'' said grocer Sahli Sagari, 43,standing outside his shop in east Jerusalem.   Sagari already has tasted the other side of the equation.   In May, he and 13 other merchants on the Street of the Prophetsopened at the specific hours ordered by uprising leaders. They wereshut down by Israeli police and charged with violating laws thatcould mean two years in prison. They now await trial.   Merchants say the government drive to enforce tax payments _ordered boycotted by uprising leaders _ has disrupted somebusinesses and forced others to close.   ``There's no way any company can clear anything unless all taxesare paid,'' said Serop T. Ohannessian, general manager of a paperfactory in Ramallah.   A tax receipt must be shown for a marriage license or a birthcertificate. Merchants say they need to produce such receipts foreverything from export and import licenses to trucks and machinery.   Tanus Abu Aitah has shut his Jordan Plastics Company nearBethlehem, which employed about 300 workers. He complained he wascaught between the Palestinian strikes, which cut his production,and the government's tax demands.   ``I am losing my customers because I'm not producing all theirneeds,'' he said. ``As for the taxes, I have to pay them whether weare working full-time or not. If I don't pay, I will be arrested.The best solution is to close the factory.''   Israeli officials say some Arab merchants have begged the army toforce shops to open to relieve merchants of the threat of revengefrom young men behind the uprising or the Palestine LiberationOrganization.   But most merchants say they back the uprising's goal of endingthe Israeli occupation of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, whichIsrael captured from Egypt and Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war.The merchants also don't want to lose customers who are makingsacrifices for the uprising.   Ohannessian, the paper products man, said he has closed hisentire plastic diaper line, laying off about 70 of his 150 workers,because of another problem.   While Israelis are stopping his trucks from reaching the GazaStrip during the uprising, Israeli manufacturers are shipping paperdiapers to the West Bank under Arab-sounding product names, he said.   ``What has happened is we're completely encircled,'' he said.``They (Israeli competitors) can extend credit to stores at a timewhen I have to ask for payment right away.''   In the West Bank town of Hebron, the owner of a food productsfactory who gave his name only as Abed said merchants trying tobring goods into Israel also run into tax collectors at armycheckpoints.   ``They stop any truck without a tax receipt. Then they confiscatethe product and the truck,'' he said.   He said Hebron's merchants fear youths who have burned cars andshops after owners were accused of breaking the strike.   In the hillside Haret al-Sheikh section of Hebron, a group ofyoung men explained that it was rarely necessary to burn anything topersuade people to strike.   ``First we send them a threatening letter,'' said one of theseven or eight present. ``If that doesn't work, we throw a `Molotov'at the wall around their house, then set a tire on fire outside. Thefourth step is to burn shops and cars.''   Some merchants find a way around orders in the undergrounduprising's leaflets, such as the one that requires Palestinianbusinesses to open only in the mornings.   Jamal Tawil, 26, keeps his east Jerusalem supermarket shutteredeach afternoon, but cut a hole in the wall from his adjacent houseso customers can enter the store unnoticed.   But even Tawil closes up the hole during general strikes.   ``I don't want to lose the business,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
