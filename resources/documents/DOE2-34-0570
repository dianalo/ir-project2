New, accurate data for thevector analyzing power iT/sub 11/ were obtained at the same time. Incombination with the results reported in part I of this series, our measurementsallow us to determine the three analyzing powers T/sub 20/, T/sub 21/,and T/sub 22/, separately, and compare them with existing theoreticalcalculations, all of which fail, in one way or another, to reproducethe entire data set.</TEXT></DOC>
