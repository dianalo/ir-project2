Jack Kemp, whose name is on the tax cutthat was the heart of Reaganomics, says he's hoping President-electGeorge Bush will give him a platform to keep spreading the word.   In an interview Thursday, Kemp said he would welcome anappointment to the National Economic Commission, the bipartisanpanel charged with making recommendations for reducing the federalbudget deficit.   The 53-year-old Republican from New York is leaving the Houseafter 18 years, having given up his seat when he bid unsuccessfullyfor the GOP presidential nomination.   Kemp says he's looking forward to spending a couple of yearsworking for a Washington research organization and making $15,000speeches. Bt, with an eye toward perhaps a future run for the WhiteHouse, he also wants to stay active in public policy.   ``I'm interested in being a trouble shooter for George Bush,''Kemp said. ``I'd like to make his administration a success.''   ``I would be interested in helping George Bush prove his case fora flexible freeze and economic growth'' to reduce the deficit, as analternative to tax increases, he said.   Kemp was being honored Thursday night at a dinner hosted by twoconservative ``think tanks,'' the Heritage Foundation and theInstitute for Free Enterprise Development.   President Reagan praised Kemp as a conservative torchbearer.``Wherever he is, he will fight for that cause, he will work forthat cause, and what unites every single person in this room is ourshared commitment to that cause,'' said Reagan.   But Bush so far isn't saying if he wants Kemp as part of histeam. Asked about an economic commission appointment on Thursday,Bush brushed the question aside.   Kemp was an author of the Kemp-Roth income tax cut of 1981, andhis appointment to the commission would underline Bush's ``read mylips'' pledge of no new taxes.   But ``When we're busy reading lips these days, we'll do well toremember that Jack, his lips move first and they move fastest. Andif I know him, they're going to keep on moving,'' said Bush of Kempduring Thursday night's tribute.   However, Kemp's appointment to the commission might deepen doubtsin the financial community about Bush's commitment to take strongaction to cut the deficit. Kemp-Roth was based on the theory thatgrowth would propel the government out of its red ink, but thebudget deficit has risen to record levels since the tax cut waspassed.   Kemp is seeking appointment to the commission even though he saidearlier this year that the effort should be ``routinely passed intothe dustbin of history.''   ``I told John Sununu about a week ago that I'd be willing to doanything they wanted me to do'' to help in the area of trade andeconomics, he said. A Cabinet appointment was not necessary, and hewouldn't take a federal appointment just so he'd still have a titleonce his term in Congress ends in January, Kemp said.   ``I'm not going to be frantic to try to keep some artificialvisibility,'' he said. ``If I were worried, I'd be doing otherthings.''   Kemp said he wouldn't mind being considered for jobs such assecretary of the treasury, secretary of defense or secretary ofstate, but he concedes such positions _ two of which are alreadyfilled _ were not likely. ``I'm not frankly anxious to go into theCabinet,'' he said when asked about speculation he was beingconsidered for secretary of housing and urban development.   In Congress, Kemp has been out front among Reagan Republicans inpushing inner-city revitalization, and that makes some consider himan attractive candidate for the HUD job.   But others say he's an activist and an advocate, not a bureaucrat.   ``He's not a detail man at all. He's interested in the bigpicture,'' said Michael Evans, a Washington economist.   Kemp friend Richard Rahn, chief economist for the U.S. Chamber ofCommerce, said, ``The key thing, from my standpoint, is making sureJack has an important role as a spokesman and policymaker.''   Rep. Vin Weber, R-Minn., a conservative ally, said that if Kempdoes not get a Cabinet position the party needs to ``find anotherrole for him to play so that he continues to provide us leadership.''   ``He's clearly the leading intellectual House Republican of mylifetime,'' said Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga. ``It's like losingTheodore Roosevelt. ... He has inspired a whole generation ofyounger members.''   As for an administration appointment, Gingrich said, ``Jack Kempis a quarterback. He has to have the ball and run with the ball. Ifthey're not going to offer him a job that's large enough for hisenergy or his drive or his intellect, I think he's better off beingat Heritage.''   Kemp is joining other Reaganites such as former Attorney GeneralEdwin Meese III as a distinguished fellow at the HeritageFoundation, and he has signed on with a Washington speakers' bureauto book him engagements.   ``I'm going to continue to speak out, travel and lecture''whether or not an official appointment comes around, he said.   Kemp's first career, before entering politics, was as aprofessional football quarterback. But he plays down talk that he'dlike to head his career back in that direction and succeed PeteRozelle as commissioner of the National Football League.   Rozelle will probably be around another three or four years, Kempsays, and besides, ``In 1992, there might be other things doing.''   ``If I got the opportuity to run again, I'd certainly jump at theopportunity,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
