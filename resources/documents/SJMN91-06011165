Last February, Christ transferred $258,798 of the SanJose bank's money to a title company, using it as the down payment for a$565,000 home in Menlo Park, according to the indictment and San Mateo Countyproperty records. Authorities say he also used bank money to buy a condominiumin Campbell.;    Through his lawyer, Christ pleaded not guilty Thursday to afederal charge of bank fraud. But attorney Craig Brown confirmed that Christhas acknowledged taking the money and is now trying to negotiate a pleabargain with the U.S. Attorney's Office in San Jose.;    &quot;He is a good anddecent person who got caught up in something which has caused him to feelanguish and regret. He is anxious to make amends,&quot; Brown said, adding that hisclient has repaid the bank.;    Christ faces up to 20 years in prison or finesequal to twice the amount stolen, said Assistant U.S. Attorney LeoCunningham.;    The indictment, issued by a federal grand jury this week,spells out a more far-reaching scheme than authorities previously disclosed.An FBI affidavit filed last month, for example, described only alleged acts ofembezzlement that took place between February and August of last year.;    Butthe indictment says Christ was opening accounts for customers without theirknowledge and transferring money between them before eventually taking it outfor his own purposes as far back as April 1988.;    Christ, who began workingat the bank in October 1986, used his sophisticated knowledge of bankprocedures &quot;to conceal this not only from bank officers but also from thecustomers,&quot; said Ted Kitada, executive vice president and general counsel forthe bank.;    Although the customers never noticed, the bank eventually becamesuspicious and started investigating, Kitada said. When officers confrontedChrist, he cooperated and allegedly recited the details of his scheme -- frommemory, according to Kitada. All customer accounts have been corrected.;   The slightly built, bespectacled Christ declined to comment Thursday outsidefederal court. But defense attorney Brown said later: &quot;This is not a casewhere the question is so much what occurred as perhaps why.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  BRANDON BAILEY, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Peninsula/AM  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910111  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  487  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday, January 11, 199100011165,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
