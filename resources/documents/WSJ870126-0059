The stock market, which moved upward last year mainly because of lower interest rates, now seems to be focusing mainly on an expectation of better corporate earnings. Meanwhile, the dollar is showing new weakness, the budget deficit isn't sinking very much, and a revival of inflation begins to look like a realistic possibility.    That's more or less the situation the Federal Open Market Committee will confront next month as it meets to plan monetary policy for 1987. What will the committee decide to do?    It may not matter very much. Last February the FOMC decided that M1, the narrowly defined money supply, should grow at a rate between 3% and 8% in 1987. In July the committee reaffirmed that range but also said that growth in excess of 3% to 8% would be &quot;acceptable.&quot; It's a good thing the committee left itself some leeway, since the actual growth rate was about 17%.    But the committee, whose voting members are the Federal Reserve governors and five of the regional Reserve Bank presidents, is required by law to say something. Composing the statement will be a little more difficult than usual this time, since the Fed seems to have gotten itself into a box.    Through last year the Federal Reserve was under pressure from the Reagan administration to force interest rates lower, depreciate the dollar and stimulate economic growth. Chairman Paul Volcker made occasional noises to the effect that a falling dollar could be inflationary, but by and large the Fed went along. After all, the consumer price index last year rose at an annual rate of 1.1%, so why worry about inflation?    Well, for one thing, oil prices, which helped to hold down the consumer index last year, have started rising again. Last week, moreover, the dollar's weakness led to another U.S.-Japan crisis conference. The administration appears to welcome the dollar's fall as a means to boost U.S. exports and persuade West Germany and Japan to stimulate their economies. But Mr. Volcker worries. Even Wayne Angell, appointed to the Reserve Board last year as an apostle of a go-go economy, is worried, commenting that the dollar's weakness, if it continues, could call for tighter credit.    Such action probably isn't imminent, but the dollar's problems are likely to lead the fine-tuning Fed to reassess its plans. Mitchell Held, an economist for the brokerage firm of Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co., says, &quot;The sharp decline in the exchange value of the U.S. dollar lends additional support to our view that the Federal Reserve will not cut the discount rate at the present time. There is a distinct risk that a U.S. discount rate cut, even if it were accompanied by a similar move by West Germany and/or Japan, would aggravate the decline in the dollar.&quot; Analysts doubt that last week's cut by West Germany will lead the Fed to cut its discount rate right away.    But stand-pat policies at the Fed may not suffice. The administration estimates that the federal budget deficit will fall to $173.2 billion in the current fiscal year, down from $220.7 billion in the previous year. Many analysts regard the administration's $173.2 billion figure as too low, but even that number would require a continuing inflow of foreign funds.    When the dollar falls, U.S. investments are cheaper for foreigners, but they worry about the future value of the investments. &quot;Some people seem to think the question is whether foreigners will pull their money out,&quot; says Jerry L. Jordan, chief economist of First Interstate Bancorp of Los Angeles. &quot;The real question is how much more money would they put in?&quot;    It's hard to see the dollar's decline stopping all by itself. A sudden resurgence in U.S. exports, a fall in imports and a resulting drop in the trade deficit might do the trick, but few economists think such a happy event is likely soon. If the dollar continues to slip for a few more months, Mr. Jordan suggests, Mr. Volcker might decide that a cumulative process was under way.    Mr. Volcker then would face these questions: &quot;Do I allow this to gain momentum until we get an inflationary blow-off? Or do I nip it in the bud by tightening money and raising interest rates?&quot; Either way would produce a recession -- one later, one sooner.    The 51 economists interviewed monthly by Blue Chip Economic Indicators on the average think consumer prices will be rising at an annual rate of 4% by the fourth quarter of this year. For those whose memories go back three or four years, that doesn't seem like much. Paul Volcker is the only member of the Reserve Board who held his job when inflation was as high as 4%.    When Mr. Volcker became Fed chairman in 1979, it was because foreigners had lost confidence in American economic policy. The new chairman restored confidence largely by taking tough actions to fight inflation. His current term expires this summer and if he is reappointed it will be because, once again, he is needed to restore confidence abroad. &quot;Mr. Volcker,&quot; says Mr. Jordan, &quot;may have worked out an ideal arrangement for job security.&quot;    Mr. Volcker's task is immensely complicated this time by the budget deficit. The deficit in fiscal 1979 was $40 billion, which seemed horrendous at the time, but presented much smaller financing problems. Maybe the administration will choose to hand this year's problems to someone else, but there could be advantages to leaving them up to Mr. Volcker. </TEXT></DOC>
