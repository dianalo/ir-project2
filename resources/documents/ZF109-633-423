 If you'relooking for a systemwide command language for Windows 3.0, you'll find twogood candidates: PubTech BatchWorks, from Publishing Technologies, and BridgeTool Kit, from Softbridge Inc.andM;BatchWorks and Bridge share the simple syntax of DOS's of tasks.andP;  You can usethem to build files that kinds of tasks.andP;  You can use them to build filesthat supplement Program Manager with a menu of all your applications, tolaunch applications with shortcut keys or to create simple Windows front endsfor your favorite DOS utilities.andM;And that's just the beginning.andP;  BatchWorks and Bridge can also handle morecomplex jobs.andP;  They are both powerful languages in their own right, able tocontrol and interact with other applications.andP;  With these products and alittle know-how, you'll be able to develop anything from custom menuingsystems to integrated programs that link several off-the-shelf applicationsand automate business activities.andM;If you like working with DOS's batch language, you'll love BatchWorks andBridge.andP;  Even if you've never tried DOS's language, you should look at thesepackages.andP;  They're the most powerful tools available for taking control ofthe Windows environment.andM;Although the capabilities of the two packages overlap considerably, the$99.95 PubTech BatchWorks is best suited for quick utility programming jobs,while the $695 Bridge Tool Kit is most useful for more complex systemsintegration projects.andM;PUBTECH BATCHWORKSandM;Programs written in BatchWorks fall into two broad categories: macros, whichgenerally act upon a specific application, and batch programs, which eitherfunction independently or interact with other applications.andM;Macros let you customize your applications, shaping them and adding newfunctions to them so that they work more to your liking.andP;  For instance,consider Notepad, the handy, bare-bones text editor bundled with Windows.andO;BatchWorks macros let you customize Notepad so that when you select FileOpen, a *.* list pops up rather than the default *.TXT list.andP;  Or write amacro that adds sections of boilerplate text to Notepad's Control menu sothat selecting a menu item called Disclaimer pastes a standard disclaimerstatement into a document.andP;  Or use the following code to add a Replacefunction to Notepad's Search facility:andM;:REPLACE a=ASKLINE(&quot;Search andamp; Replace&quot;, &quot;Search for:&quot;,&quot;&quot;) b=ASKLINE(&quot;Search andamp;Replace&quot;, &quot;Replace with:&quot;,&quot;&quot;) WINACTIVATE(&quot;Notepad&quot;) SENDKEY(&quot;!SF%a%{ENTER}&quot;)SENDKEY(&quot;%b%&quot;) EXITandM;This routine, identified with the label REPLACE, makes double use of ASKLINE,a BatchWorks command that creates a small dialog box and asks the user for asingle line of input.andP;  The first instance of ASKLINE obtains the string forwhich the routine should search and assigns it to variable [alpha], while thesecond obtains the replacement string and assigns it to variable b.andP;  Then theroutine springs into action: First it activates the Notepad window.andP;  Then itsends keystrokes that tell Notepad to search for the first instance of stringa (! is equivalent to the Alt key; Alt-SF causes Notepad to highlight thestring once it's found).andP;  Finally, it sends string b to replace thehighlighted string.andM;ASKLINE is one of BatchWorks' three one-line commands that summon simpledialog boxes.andP;  The other two commands, MESSAGE and ASKYESNO, are used torelay information to the user or to obtain a simple yes-or-no response, asfollows:andM;MESSAGE(&quot;Not Found&quot;, &quot;The search string could not be located!&quot;)andM;ASKYESNO(&quot;End of File&quot;, &quot;Continue search from top of file?&quot;)andM;The first command displays &quot;The search string could not be located!&quot; followedby an &quot;OK&quot; button in a dialog box labeled &quot;Not Found,&quot; while the seconddisplays &quot;Continue search from top of file?&quot; followed by &quot;Yes,&quot; &quot;No&quot; and&quot;Cancel&quot; buttons in a dialog box titled &quot;End of File.&quot;andM;Be a Box BuilderandM;The ability to create simple dialog boxes with a single command makes it easyto develop programs quickly with BatchWorks, but it takes only a little moreeffort to make more complex dialog boxes.andP;  For instance, you can build a morecomprehensive search-and-replace macro by constructing a dialog box withoptions for variables such as the direction of the search and whether theroutine should automatically replace every instance of the search string orfirst query the user.andM;To build a custom dialog box, you must first create a dialog box templatefile in an ASCII editor such as Notepad.andP;  Then call the template from yourBatchWorks program.andP;  The template file for the Search and Replace dialog boxlooks something like this:andM;Replace: [#a ] With: [#b ] Replace: [andless;c1Query first] [andless;c2Replace all] Search:[andless;d1Forward] [andless;d2Reverse] [andless;d3From top]andM;This template will create a dialog box with two editable text fields neachdenoted by the # character) labeled &quot;Replace:&quot; and &quot;With:&quot;.andP;  Also, two setsof check boxes (each box denoted by the andless; character) will appear, one toindicate whether the routine should query the user before replacing thesearch strig or replace all occurrences of the string at once, and the secondset to indicate the direction of the search (forward, backward or from thetop of the file).andP;  The search string will be assigned to variable a, thereplacement string to b, the results of the first set of checkboxes to c andthose of the second set to d.andM;To use this dialog box template, you save it under the name, say,REPLACE.DLG, and then include a command such as:andM;DIALOGBOX (&quot;Search and Replace&quot;,&quot;replace.dlg&quot;)andM;in your script, telling BatchWorks to draw the dialog box and put &quot;Search andReplace&quot; on its title bar.andM;Once you've drawn the dialog box, you have to write code so that the macroresponds to the user's check box selections.andP;  For instance, if the userselects the From Top box, the macro must issue the following Ctrl-Homecommand:andM;SENDKEY(&quot;andless;{HOME}&quot;)andM;which moves the cursor to the top of the Notepad file before starting thesearch for string a.andM;BatchWorks' process for creating dialog boxes is clumsy compared with theWysiwyg dialog box editors that are included in many Windows programmingtools (including Bridge Tool Kit).andP;  Moreover, it provides only limitedcontrol over the placement of dialog box elements, and it supports only asubset of Windows' user-interface controls: list boxes, editable text fields,radio buttons and check boxes.andP;  Still, BatchWorks has the virtue of beingsimple and fast.andP;  Once you have mastered the syntax of the templates, you canbuild new dialog boxes almost instantly.andM;In addition to creating dialog boxes to pop up over other Windowsapplications, BatchWorks macros can interact with those applications bytyping text into them and by manipulating their screen windows.andP;  The commandsandM;WINACTIVATE(&quot;Microsoft Word&quot;) SENDKEY(&quot;Sample text&quot;) SENDKEY(&quot;!FS&quot;)WINICONIZE(&quot;Microsoft Word&quot;)andM;will perform the following tasks, respectively: 1) activate Word for Windows;2) type the words Sample text into the current document; 3) save the file(Alt-FS is Word for Windows' keyboard command for File Save); and 4) iconizethe Word for Windows window.andM;The BatchWorks language also has several Clipboard-oriented commands:CLIP-PUT to copy a string to the Clipboard, CLIPGET to copy the contents ofthe Clipboard to a string and CLIPAPPEND to append a string to Clipboard'scurrent contents.andP;  These are useful for moving large blocks of data betweenapplications faster than is possible with the SENDKEY command.andM;BatchWorks does not include DDE (Dynamic Data Exchange) commands, although itcan automate the initiation of DDE links between programs that do supportDDE.andP;  Nor does it have the ability to pass commands or keystrokes tonon-Windows applications once they're running nexcept through the Clipboard).andO;However, you can use its standard program-launching commands to launchnon-Windows applications and pass filenames or other command-line parametersto them, making it especially useful for building front ends to DOScommand-line line utilities that require no user input once they have beeninitiated.andM;Beside these Windows-oriented commands, BatchWorks supports a set of string,math, statistical and file-control functions roughly equivalent to thosefound in BASIC, and it has a limited but functional set of flow-controlconmands: GOTOS, IF-THEN loops and EXECUTE and CALL statements.andP;  It doesn'toffer direct support for variable arrays, but its variable-substitutioncapabilities are so flexible, you can work around that quite easily.andP;  Infact, you can use a variable name almost anywhere in a BatchWorksscript--even in the middle of a text string to be displayed or as the addressin a GOTO statement.andP;  That capability, as well as BatchWorks' willingnes toconvert string variables to integer variables and vice versa, makes it anextremely friendly environment for quick-and-dirty program development.andO;(Whether the resulting code is as suitable for long-term projects, wheredecipherability is a concern, is open to question.)andM;BatchWorks doesn't have a program editor, but you can use any ASCII editor tocompose your programs.andP;  It does include a pair of useful programming aids: adebugger that steps through the execution of a program and displays thecurrent value of any variable, and a macro recorder.andP;  The BatchWorks macrorecorder differs from th eone included with Windows in two importantrespects: it records only keystrokes rather than keystrokes and mouseactions, and the macro files that it records can be edited.andP;  Thus, you canuse it to capture an involved sequence of keyboard commands, then use thatsequence as the basis of a BatchWorks program, adding dialog boxes andmessages as necessary.andM;To use the BatchWorks macro recorder with an application, you must have themacro interpreter PT Macro in memory and you must define a list of the macrosfor that application and their keyboard shortcut keys in a text file, savedunder the same name as the application's executable file but with a .PDFextension.andP;  (Thus, the macro definition file for NOTEPAD.EXE would beNOTEPAD.PDF.)andM;Once you've done so, PT Macro will add a list of available macros to theapplication's Control menu (the menue used to resize or close an application,activated by the square box  in theupper left corner).andP;  PT Macro will watchwhat you type as you work within the application, to see if you use akeyboard shortcut to execute one of the macros.andP;  Any of the macros can belaunched either by selecting it from the Control menu or by pressing itsshortcut key combination.andM;In addition to application-specific macros, PT Macro lets you create a filecalled GLOBAL.PDF that lists macros or batch programs you want to beavailable from within any application.andP;  Macros and programs in GLOBAL.PDFwill appear on the Control menu of every Windows application (and every DOSapplication running in a 386 Enhanced mode window), alongside anyapplication-specific macros you've defined.andM;One handy way to use GLOBAL.PDF is as a program launcher for your favoriteapplications.andP;  If you use Ami Professional, SuperBase IV and Crosstalk forWindows, for example, you can add three macros that launch those programs toGLOBAL.PDF and assign shortcut keys to each one.andP;  Then, whenever you selectthe SuperBase menu item or press the program's shortcut key, BatchWorkslaunches SuperBase.andM;If you've defined both GLOBAL.PDF macros and NOTEPAD.PDF macros, for example,selecting the Control menu in Notepad brings down a list of Notepad-specificmacros (such as the Replace function listed above) followed by a list ofglobal macros, such as instructions to launch file Manager or Paintbrush,while pressing any of the shortcut keys you've defined will execute a macrofrom either NOTEPAD.PDF or GLOBAL.PDF.andM;Whip Up a BatchandM;So far we've talked almost exclusively about BatchWorks macros.andP;  Batchprograms, the other kind of routine you can build, have similar capabilitiesand use the same programming commands as macros, but they can runindependently of a specific application.andM;Because batch programs are not application-specific, you can use them anytimefor tasks ranging from launching an application (by a command such as RUN(&quot;AmiPro&quot;,&quot;&quot;)) to building menus of applications or launching sets ofapplications (for instance, launchiang the &quot;Desktop Publishing Set&quot; wouldload PageMaker and Corel Draw).andM;Batch files can also be used to build Windows front ends for DOSapplications.andP;  One example is a fron end included with BatchWorks for PKXARC,a file-decompression utility that's usually run from the DOS command line,using a string of parameters such as:andM;PKXARC -e- r DOWNLOAD.ARC c:\unarc\files\*.*andM;The PKXARC front end replaces the DOS command line with a Windows dialog boxfrom which you can choose an ARCED file and the options you wish to activate.andO;Once you've indicated your choice, it constructs the command line and passesit to PKXARC.andM;In addition, batch programs can be used to build small standalone programs.andO;For instance, you can build a simple file backup program to copy all yourdocument files to a backup disk at 6 p.m.andP;  every day.andM;All in all, BatchWorks delivers a lot of functinality for $99.95.andP;  You mayfind that it supplies all the features you'll eer need from a Windows batchlanguage.andP;  As your programming projects get more complex, though, sooner orlater you may run up against BatchWorks' limitations.andP;  Maybe you'll need moreversatile dialog boxes or integral support for DDE, or the ability to sendkeystrokes to DOS applications.andP;  When that time comes, you're ready forBridge Tool Kit.andM;PubTech BatchWorks List Price: $99.95.andP;  Publishing Technologies Inc., 7719Wood Hollow Drive, Suite 260, Austin, Texas 78731; (800) PUBTECH, (512)346-2835.andM;BRIDGE TOOL KITandM;At $695, Bridge Tool Kit doesn't have quite the &quot;bargain&quot; feel thatBatchWorks does.andP;  But if you're looking for a full-powered systemsintegration tool to build customized workstations or automate complexprocesses, Bridge's extra power is well worth the cost.andM;While BatchWorks primarily helps you work with individual applications,Bridge Tool Kit is more concerned with linking multiple applications.andP;  Muchof the program's focus is on communications: between you and yourapplications, between Windows applications, between Windows and DOSapplications and between applications over a network.andM;Like BatchWorks, the Bridge languuage echoes the syntax and command structureof DOS's batch language.andP;  But it goes beyond DOS's limits, including morepowerful program control functions, such as GOSUBs and WHILE loops, as wellas an extensive set of array-handling commands.andM;Bridge is also much more flexible than BatchWorks at building full-fledgedWindows interfaces for your applications.andP;  You can create cascading drop-downmenus for the Bridge window, which in turn can launch programs or initiatecommand sequences.andP;  A menu item labeled &quot;Excel&quot; can simply launch Excel,while another one labeled &quot;Consolidate Regional Sales&quot; can initiate a processwhereby sales figures from six regional worksheets are consolidated into anew Excel worksheet.andP;  Meanwhile, you can include all your applications onmenus in the Bridge window titled &quot;My Workstation&quot; and make that your primarycontrol center for Windows.andM;Bridge's menus work only in the Bridge window; you can't add items to anotherapplication's control menu as in BatchWorks.andP;  Even so, you can create bothapplication-specific and global hotkey commands using Bridge's ON KEYcommand.andP;  For instancE, the commandsandM;SELECT write; ON KEY %%i GOSUB insertboiler SELECT windows; ON KEY %%c GOSUBcloseallandM;could (assuming that the routines &quot;insertboiler&quot; and &quot;closeall&quot; exist) inserta boilerplate paragraph into Write when Alt-I is pressed and close all openwindows when Alt-C is pressed.andM;Bridge also includes a batch file editor with such features as auto-indent,the ability to paste commands and functions from a scrolling list into yourscript and an integral Dialog Editor, which acts like a macro recorder as youdraw the dialog box you want onscreen.andM;With the Dialog Editor, you can create dialog boxes using the full range ofWindows 3.0 user-interface controls, including editable text boxes, comboboxes (with list as well as editable text fields), list boxes, radio buttonsand check boxes, text messages, icon buttons, group boxes, bitmaps andpushbuttons.andP;  You can size any box and position it where you want itonscreen, then select the controls that you want to include from the DialogEditor's menu and place them exactly where you want them to appear in thebox.andM;Once you're finished, select the Dialog Editor's Save command to paste thecommands necessary to creae the dialog box into the Bridge batch editor.andP;  Thereduces the attractive box you've just drawn to a string of cmmands such as:andM;DIALOG DEFINE SELECTWKS BEGIN AT 26 44 SIZE 94 89 CAPTION &quot;Select Worksheet&quot;LISTBOX AT 14 6 LINES 6 WIDTH 12 SORTED REQUIRED Y RESULT F TEMPLATE&quot;c:\123\*.wk?&quot; PUSHBUTTON AT 26 64 DEFAULT 1 &quot;Okay&quot;andM;Two aspects of this process are noteworthy.andP;  Pasting the dialog box into yourbatch program is a two-way street: If you want to tinker further with thedialog box, you can select it and use the batch editor's Edit Dialog commandto load it back into the Dialog Editor.andP;  And if you're using Bridge forprototyping work, you can save finished dialog boxes in Windows SDK (SoftwareDevelopment Kit) format for use in compiled C programs.andP;  This precise controlof dialog-box design lets you give applications a professional look, asdialog boxes are the primary means of communication with Windows programusers.andM;Bridge's dialog boxes are as powerful as they are attractive, thanks to thelanguage's Dialog Validate command.andP;  This allows you to evaluate the resultsof a dialog box before it is erased from the screen.andP;  For instance, you mightcompare what the user has entered with a list of acceptable inputs.andP;  If theresult is invalid, your Bridge program can produce a second dialog boxdescribing the error and then refresh the original box, positioning thecursor at the error.andM;Of course, this versatility comes at a price.andP;  As simple as the Dialog Editoris to use, Bridge gives you no way to create an instant dialog box like thosebuilt by Batch-Works' one-line ASKYESNO or MESSAGE commands.andP;  You have to usethe Dialog Editor to build even the simplest box or user message.andM;Two other amenities for programmers are a trace mode, in which all Bridgecommands and messages are echoed to the Bridge window or to a file orprinter, and a Browser that lets you examine the current values of anyvariable or open window.andP;  You can even change the values of variables fromwithin the Browser, making it a powerful debugging tool.andM;One amenity that Bridge doesn't supply is a macro or batch recorder, anoversight that seems especially silly, since SoftBridge wrote the Recorderthat's included with Windows.andP;  Moreover, you can't even import Recordermacros (not even the keystroke portion) into Bridge.andM;Dynamic ConversationsandM;Like BatchWorks, Bridge gives you a great deal of control over other Windowsapplications.andP;  You can launch programs, retitle their windows, move themaround on the screen, hide their windows, minimize and maximize them and typetext or commands into them.andP;  But Bridge goes further, providing powerfulmechanisms for interprocess communication.andM;The most familiar of these is DDE.andP;  Bridge includes extensive support for DDEcommunications, with the ability to act either as a DDE requestor (theinitiator of a &quot;DDE conversation&quot;) or a server (the second party in theconversation who responds to the initiator's requests) or as both in multipleconversations.andM;Bridge can hold DDE conversations only with other applications that supportDDE, among which there has been little standardization.andP;  Therefore, to takeadvantage of Bridge's DDE commands you must learn both their syntax and themanner and style in which the other application has implemented the DDEprotocol.andM;Nevertheless, once established, a DDE channel is a powerful tool that allowstwo-way exchange of data between active applications.andP;  The difference betweensuch an exchange and simply typing text into another application is like thatbetween writing a letter and talking on the phone.andP;  Using DDE, Bridge cansend an application a chunk of data and instructions how to process it andthen request that the application send back the result.andP;  A Bridge programdesigned to automate a monthly report could use DDE to extract spreadsheetdata from Excel and corporate financial data from a remote mainframe, thenpump all the data through a DDE link into a Word for Windows table andfinally use DDE to tell Word for Windows how to format the numbers.andM;Another method of interprocess communication is the Bridge command line, auseful option when you want to send a message back to Bridge from anotherWindows application that doesn't support DDE but can launch a program.andO;Bridge can communicate with the application through a PUT command that typestext into it, such as:andM;SELECT Write; PUT &quot;Here's some text for Write&quot;andM;However, the application normally can't get a message back to Bridge.andP;  Thecommand-line method lets it launch a second copy of Bridge, with the messagefor Bridge included on its command line (so that the line to launch theprogram would read something like BRIDGE.EXE ;EXEC EXCEL).andP;  The second copyof Bridge passes the command to the first copy and terminates while the firstcopy executes the command.andP;  This is pretty inefficient but may be the onlyway to get necessary messages back from a non-DDE application.andM;Get a Message ThroughandM;The centerpiece of Bridge's interprocess communications, however, is itsmessaging facility.andP;  Enabled by running the TSR program BRMSG.EXE beforeloading Windows, the facility acts as a mail service that routes messagesbetween Bridge and DOS applications, other Windows application and thoserunning on other workstations across a NetBIOS-compatible LAN.andM;In order to communicate with a DOS application via the messaging facility,Bridge must first launch the application along with BRDOS.EXE, a DOS shellthat handles the actual communication with BRMSG.andP;  If Windows is running in386 Enhanced mode, Bridge gains the ability to send keystrokes to DOSapplications, to select and copy parts of its screen to the keyboard, to waituntil a specified string of characters appears before executing furthercommands (you might, for instance, have it wait until 1-2-3's READY indicatorappears before issuing a command to save a worksheet), to set up hotkeys forthe application and to paste the contents of the Windows clipboard into theapplication.andM;Thus, with 1-2-3 already running in the BRDOS shell, you can pass it commandsto erase its current worksheet with this line:andM;SELECT 123; PUT &quot;/wey&quot;andM;or to load a file whose name was stored in the variable &quot;f&quot; with this line:andM;SELECT 123; PUT &quot;/fr{ESC}%f%~&quot;andM;Or, you can notify Bridge that 1-2-3 is ready to accept additional commandswith this line:andM;SELECT 123 ON SCREEN READY 1 76 1 5 MSG SEND MYMBX 123 &quot;OK&quot;andM;(The coordinates 1 76 1 5 tell Bridge where to look for the READY indicator.andO;The rest of the line sends the message &quot;OK&quot; to the MYMBX mailbox set up bythe messaging facility and identifies 1-2-3 as the sender.)andM;If you run Windows in Standard or Real mode, Bridge's ability to communicatewith DOS applications is crippled--it can't interactively pass commands tothe DOS application.andP;  It can pass commands to it upon launching it, even ifthe application doesn't support command-line parameters.andP;  Thus, the followingcommand can launch 1-2-3 and load the BUDGET.WK1 file:andM;EXEC BRDOs 123; PUT &quot;/frbudget~&quot;andM;Once the file is loaded, you can interact manually with 1-2-3 until you quit,after which your Bridge application will continue to execute.andM;Bridge's messaging facility can also exchange messages with other Windowsapplications that have been compiled with the BRDYN.LIB file included withBridge Tool Kit.andP;  BRDYN.LIB gives the applications functions to access theBridge Message Controller.andP;  Thus, if you're writing Windows programs in C,you can include messaging capabilities quite easily.andM;Finally, Bridge's messaging facility can send messages over aNetBIOS-compatible LAN to another Bridge application running on another PC.andO;Each PC must have BRMSG.EXE loaded into memory and must have used it tocreate a unique network mailbox name.andP;  Then the two applications can exchangedata and messages interactively as long as the network link exists.andM;Bridge Tool Kit's unique interprocess communications capabilities, combinedwith its strong user-interface design tools and its straightforward commonsequence, make it a powerful and surprisingly simple systems integrationtool.andP;  Its $695 price makes it less suitable for casual programmers thanBatchWorks, but for those who are seriously interested in linkingoff-the-shelf applications into integrated systems, neither that price northe $125 cost of the Bridge runtime module ought to stand as a seriousdeterrent.andM;Bridge Tool Kit List Price: $695;
