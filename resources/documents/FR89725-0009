This regulationdeletes the requirement to submit forecasts of total passenger automobileand light truck lease and purchase requirements to GSA. Actual vehicleleases and agency vehicle purchases not procured through the GSA AutomotiveCommodity Center will continue to be reported to GSA, ATTN: FBF, Washington,DC 20406. This action is intended to reduce the paperwork associated withagency compliance with Executive Orders 11912 and 12375.On October 6, 1988, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,Department of Transportation, published fleet average fuel economy objectivesfor fiscal years 1989 through 1991. This regulation adds those objectivesto the Federal Property Management Regulations.Agencies satisfy their motor vehicle requirements by requisitioning themthrough the GSA Automotive Commodity Center using Federal specifications.Sedans, station wagons, and light trucks also have Federal standards whichfacilitate volume purchasing. The GSA Automotive Commodity Center has developedand issued Federal standard 794 covering medium trucks. This regulationprovides for the use of Federal standard 794, where appropriate, in additionto Federal standards 122, 292, and 307.Comptroller General decisions indicate that Government employees are personallyresponsible for fines imposed by State and local courts for the violationof motor vehicle traffic laws. This regulation adds these determinationsto the Federal Property Management Regulations.Many States have raised the maximum speed limit for motor vehicles from55 mph to 65 mph. This regulation instructs Federal motor vehicle operatorsto obey posted speed limits at all times.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE:</T2> July 25, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2> Mr. Michael W.
