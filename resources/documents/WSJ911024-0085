The Houston computer maker said it had a net loss of $70million, or 82 cents a share, in the third quarter, comparedwith net income of $124 million, or $1.38 a share, a yearearlier. Revenue, hurt by the recession, sluggish computersales and lower prices, fell almost 18% to $709 million from$863 million in the third quarter last year.</LP><TEXT>   Despite the dismal results, Wall Street analysts said theywere pleased to see the once-fast-growing computer maker takecost-cutting steps that acknowledge that the personalcomputer market has forever changed. For months, Compaq hasdelayed layoffs, just as it tried to continue chargingpremium prices until discount computer makers bit deeply intoits market share. &quot;They're finally recognizing the rightthing to do, but it makes you wonder what took them so long,&quot;said Bruce M. Lupatkin, an analyst with Hambrecht andamp; Quist.   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,Compaq closed at $35, up $1.375.   By eliminating about 1,400 jobs world-wide over the nexttwo weeks, analysts said the company will be able to betterrespond to lower-priced computers from Dell Computer Corp.,an aggressive direct marketer, and others. Compaq also saidit will create two separate divisions, one to manage itspersonal computer line and another to handle its largersystems. &quot;Our businesses got so complex we were dealing withtwo different customer needs,&quot; said Joseph &quot;Rod&quot; Canion,president and chief executive officer of Compaq.   Compaq said it has spent several months studying majorstructural changes in its products, pricing, distribution andpromotion. In a recent interview, Compaq Chief OperatingOfficer Eckhard Pfeiffer said, &quot;In late July, we puteverything up for review.&quot;   While the company was once concerned mainly with giantInternational Business Machines Corp., it now will focus oncompetition from smaller price-aggressive players and evenmail-order suppliers, Mr. Pfeiffer said. And while Compaqonce relied heavily on a loyal group of computer dealers, thecompany will soon rely on several different distributionchannels, including direct sales handled by specializedresellers and mass-market sales handled by superstores.Finally, Compaq is interviewing advertising agencies to helpit change its image as provider of over-priced machines.   Without the special restructuring charge, analysts saidthe company's operating results were generally in line withtheir expectations and generated some optimism that thecompany will quickly return to profitability. &quot;I told mysales force this is great news, that Compaq is serious aboutgetting costs in line,&quot; said Doug van Dorsten, an analystwith Shearson Lehman Brothers.   But even with the optimism, Daniel Benton, an analyst withGoldman Sachs, kept his fourth-quarter earnings projectionsat 60 cents a share. In the fourth quarter of 1990, Compaqearned $134.8 million, or $1.51 a share, on revenue of $1billion.   Compaq declined to project earnings, but the companywarned that it and the industry still face many challenges.The economy and the computer market remain &quot;unsettled,&quot;holding down increases in sales of computer units. And, itsaid, price competition continues to reduce revenue and hurtmargins.</TEXT></DOC>
