With too few illegal immigrants available to pick them, Mr. Lester says he has already lost as much as $20,000 of his harvest.    In Houston, Juan Garcia Garcia, who runs a housekeeper-referral service, is living by the letter of the law. A former illegal immigrant from Guatemala and now a legal resident of the U.S., Mr. Garcia demands proof of legal residence from a woman who is a lifelong citizen of the U.S.    In applying for work in a Los Angeles aircraft-parts factory, Danilo Jimenez produces a permanent resident-alien card to prove that he is legally eligible for employment in the U.S. But the perfectly valid document is an outdated version that the company arbitrarily refuses to accept. The employer, Mr. Jimenez says, &quot;told me he was sorry, but because of the new law he couldn't take any chances.&quot;    Confusion and anxiety reign in workplaces across the country as the most sweeping immigration-reform law of the century begins to take effect. For the first time in history, it is against the law to hire an illegal immigrant. Essentially, the law has transformed the nation's seven million employers into agents of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. And for many, it is a role that they neither welcome nor understand.    Already, isolated labor shortages -- which weren't supposed to occur under the law -- are causing production cutbacks that could eventually increase certain consumer prices. Employers also must perform a difficult balancing act: to avoid hiring illegal immigrants without illegally discriminating against applicants of dark skin or foreign mien. Almost all employers -- even those who have never hired an illegal immigrant -- must this week begin keeping detailed new records documenting their efforts to maintain a workplace free of illegal aliens.    Moreover, confusion is rife over what the new law entails and over when various provisions take effect. It became unlawful to hire illegals after Nov. 6, 1986, the day President Reagan signed the law. But employer sanctions weren't scheduled to begin until June 1. Then, however, the Immigration and Naturalization Service announced that it would put off enforcement until July 1. Other rules aren't scheduled to take effect until Sept. 1. To add to the muddle, the Senate last week narrowly approved a budget-bill amendment that will, if enacted, delay all start-up dates to Oct. 1.    &quot;The law deserves your support,&quot; says the INS in a draft of an 18-page handbook for employers. But the handbook has yet to be mailed out.    As of June 1, for every person newly hired since Nov. 6, 1986, employers must complete the new INS I-9 form, in which they attest to inspecting documents establishing citizenship or the right to work in the U.S. Yet the final version of the required form wasn't ready for distribution until this week. So newspaper ads ran on Wednesday with clip-out I-9s that employers could photocopy.    And already, while many employers begin demanding official documents from applicants, some illegals are arranging to obtain fake ones. A reporter for this newspaper purchased a birth certificate -- proof of citizenship -- in a tavern in El Paso, Texas, for $80. Passports, the best form of proof, were selling for about $200.    Complicating matters further, the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 contains provisions to &quot;legalize&quot; many illegals while outlawing the hiring of others. The INS estimates that two million to four million of the nation's illegals may seek temporary legal residence by proving that they have lived in the U.S. since Jan. 1, 1982. Under the law, these immigrants can work legally in the U.S. if they certify that they plan to file for amnesty -- but the INS has no such certification forms available.    Thus, the Rev. Gregory Boyle of Dolores Mission Church, just east of downtown Los Angeles, is distributing &quot;self-authorization forms&quot; on church stationery. &quot;The level of ignorance on the part of employers is appalling,&quot; Father Boyle says. They may know about the law, he says, but not about the fine print -- and &quot;it's the fine print that saves people's jobs.&quot;    Whenever enforcement does begin, it will be spotty at best. As the new quarry of the INS, employers initially can expect &quot;a modest enforcement presence,&quot; with only a &quot;couple of hundred&quot; investigators, says Mark Everson, the INS executive associate commissioner. The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas estimates that the law eventually will reduce employment of illegals by only 15% to 25% -- although that is still a lot of workers.    Even with all the ambiguity, most major employers appear to be committed to abiding by the law. Many are attending seminars; they are training personnel staffs and setting up new record-keeping procedures to comply with the intricacies of the act. Civil fines range from $250 to $10,000 per employee, with criminal sentences of a possible six months in prison.    &quot;Just by ignorance of the law, you could wind up with multi-violations -- as well as a six-month tour of your local federal facility,&quot; says Virginia Rousseau, the personnel manager for Gordon's Jewelry Corp., a retailer that has hired several hundred employees since the law was signed.    The INS has opened a toll-free hot line to answer employers' questions and has conducted more than 1,000 seminars for employers. But some employers insist they won't act until the government distributes the official forms and instruction handbooks. &quot;As an employer, I just can't believe I have had no government contact on this,&quot; says George Wells, who runs a temporary-help agency in Rochester, N.Y.    Even though the law is in flux, it is having an impact, in some cases severe. Perhaps, the most obvious is labor shortages.    After losing 35 of his 100 workers, Ricardo Arciniega says his Los Angeles garment shop is running at only 45% capacity and faces millions of dollars in lost revenue. &quot;I have had to turn down orders right and left,&quot; he says. Mr. Arciniega has repeatedly requested referrals from the state unemployment agency and has tried recruiting workers on his own by purchasing newspaper ads and distributing fliers in immigrant neighborhoods. Yet in the past month he has had but a dozen applications.    Long dependent on labor from Mexico, Western growers may be the hardest hit so far. The Oregon state agriculture department estimates that some regions have two-thirds of their jobs vacant. Lloyd Duyck, who owns a 2,000-acre berry and vegetable farm near Portland, Ore., has hired only 150 of the 250 hands he needs to harvest his strawberry crop; he estimates that up to one-quarter of the harvest will rot. In Santa Paula, Calif., Ralph DeLeon, a labor contractor, is nearly 100 workers short of the 600 he usually fields this time of year; as a result, he says, many overripe lemons will have to be sold as lower-priced byproducts.    These shortages were never supposed to happen. As a political trade-off to push the new immigration law toward passage, agribusiness was allowed to expand a little-used &quot;guest worker&quot; program of the old immigration law. Moreover, sanctions pertaining to agricultural employers won't take effect until Dec. 1, 1988. And a special, accelerated amnesty program for illegal-immigrant farmworkers, which began June 1, requires only that workers prove they spent 90 days in the U.S., to qualify for temporary legal residence.    But despite the special treatment, many migrant workers have quit making the trip north from Mexico for hoeing or harvesting. The special guest-worker program arouses emotional memories, which the Mexican press has rekindled in recent weeks, of the U.S. bracero program, instituted during World War II to offset labor shortages caused by the military draft. Before the program ended in 1964, Mexican workers brought to the U.S. in organized pools were subjected to fumigations and other humiliations.    &quot;My uncle worked in Wyoming as a bracero in the '50s, and to this day he doesn't want to go back to the United States,&quot; says 23-year-old Ricardo Santiesteban, who has forsworn participating in any organized guest-worker programs. Under the current farmworker-amnesty program, certain farmworkers wishing eventually to attain citizenship must spend at least three months a year -- for at least five years -- in fields or orchards.    Some growers have flown to Mexico to recruit workers. Certain California growers have raised wages as much as 8% in recent weeks. The Oregon Farm Bureau is trying to get the Spanish-language media in Southern California to publicize the need for workers. Lufthansa German Airlines says it received a proposal from a South Texas economic council to sell U.S. vacations to German cowboy aficionados, who would spend part of the holiday working as ranch hands, filling jobs left by illegal workers.    For employers fearful of unwittingly hiring an illegal -- or employers unwilling to do the paper work themselves -- the solution may be hiring a labor contractor. Robert Rule, a regional vice president for Talent Tree Inc., says his temporary-help concern will assume responsibility for verifying each worker's legal status -- and for carrying the risk of sanctions. &quot;Whenever there are additional administrative burdens on corporate America,&quot; Mr. Rule says, &quot;that opens up a window of opportunity for us.&quot;    Some employers, on the other hand, are working full-throttle to legalize their work forces. In San Francisco, Levi Strauss andamp; Co. instituted its own amnesty-assistance program in mid-May to help maintain its employment at 18 plants in Texas and New Mexico. Some 10,000 workers cut and stitch at the plants, one-third of them illegal aliens, an INS district director estimates.    Many employers, however, steadfastly refuse to help illegal immigrants establish proof of residence by providing them with an affidavit documenting their years on the job. Employers who paid workers off-the-books cash wages are afraid that the Internal Revenue Service will prosecute them, although the INS points out that the new law prevents it from informing the IRS.    But some employers attempting to gain a leg up on the new law have been frustrated. Weyerhaeuser Co., the big forest-products concern in Tacoma, Wash., recently distributed a list to all personnel managers identifying the documents that were acceptable to prove a worker's identity and eligibility. Then, the INS expanded the list, forcing the company to send out a new bulletin to its managers.    &quot;I probably spend an hour a day on the phone answering questions from the field,&quot; says Nancy Oltman, Weyerhaeuser's affirmative-action director.    Sanctions against employers who hire illegals have proved to be an ineffective deterrent in 20 other nations, according to a study by the General Accounting Office. In the past three years, Canada convicted only 42 employers under its law.    But whether sanctions succeed in the U.S. will depend not only on the resolve and resources of immigration authorities but also on the will of immigrants themselves. What ultimately happens will also depend on the extent of economic opportunity in their homelands.    Along the U.S. bank of the Rio Grande in El Paso, 17-year-old Carlos de la Torre excitedly contemplates his future. Just across the river, in Juarez, the wiry teenager was earning about $25 a week in an assembly plant. But about a month ago, he says, &quot;I heard that more people were leaving the United States. So I thought that would be a good opportunity for me to go to look for a job.&quot; He found one right away as a gardener in El Paso, making as much in a day as he had made in a week in Juarez.    After years of viewing immigration to the U.S. as an economic &quot;safety valve,&quot; authorities in Mexico take a dim view of the new law. In May, for instance, police in Juarez were preparing to disperse a group of protesters who were reportedly defacing an international bridge linking Juarez and El Paso. But when the police saw that the protesters were painting a mural of a woman being carried across the Rio Grande on a man's back, they joined the crowd, watching approvingly as the painting progressed.    In the midst of all the graffiti painted on the bridge was this plaintive question: &quot;You sure you don't need us anymore?&quot;    ---   KEY DATES IN THE NEW IMMIGRATION LAW   Nov. 6, 1986: President Reagan signed Simpson-Rodino Act, which grants amnesty and provides for employer sanctions for knowingly hiring an illegal immigrant after this date.

June 1, 1987: Formal effective date of employer sanctions. However, INS has delayed the enforcement date to July 1, 1987, except for &quot;very flagrant&quot; abuses. In addition, a special legalization program for farmworkers began.    July 1, 1987: INS will begin issuing citations for an employer's first offense of knowingly hiring an illegal immigrant after June 1.    Sept. 1, 1987: INS will begin issuing first-offense citations to employers who hired illegal immigrants between Nov. 6, 1986, and June 1, 1987.    May 4, 1988: Deadline for individuals to apply for amnesty.    June 1, 1988: Fines replace paper citations for first offenses.    Dec. 1, 1988: The delay of employer sanctions for agricultural growers ends. INS begins full enforcement of the law.    Nov. 6, 1993: First wave of amnesty applicants begin qualifying for U.S. citizenship.    ---   TOP 10 EMPLOYERS OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS  (Percentage estimates based on 1980 Census)   Apparel and textiles 12.25%      Agriculture                  8.2%   Restaurants 7.39%      Construction                 6.46%   Food processing 4.02%      Metals industry              3.92%   Electrical machinery 3.06%      Transportation equipment     2.4%   Education 2.26%      Retailing                    2.20%   Source: Dallas Federal Reserve   ---       WHERE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS LIVE (Percentage estimates based on 1980 Census)       California              49.8%       New York                11.4%       Texas                    9.1%       Illinois                 6.6%       Florida                  3.9%       All Others              19.2%   Source: Dallas Federal Reserve</TEXT></DOC>
