Law enforcement officers from 12 federal, state and localagencies were dispatched to the Eden Detention Center in centralTexas to quell the disturbance, officials said.   The inmates were upset with prison conditions and food andrefused to return to their dormitories, Concho County Sheriff BillFiveash said. He said a few mattresses were burned, but the protestwas generally non-violent.   The disturbance was reported shortly after 5 p.m., and appearedto involve most of the 330 inmates. By 11:30 p.m., fewer than 100inmates remained in the yard.   ``We will not take any steps. We will let them sit in the yardand wait,'' Jim Eyskens, a federal Bureau of Prisons officer basedin San Antonio, said of those inmates. ``I'm certain this will beresolved without force.''   Roy Burnes, the owner of the detention center, denied thatinmates burned mattresses. ``Nothing was burned,'' Burnes told TheAssociated Press. He then said he didn't have time to talk and hungup.   Some civilian employees who had locked themselves inside wereescorted out.   A prison official who refused to identify herself said no onewas in immediate danger.   A fire in December caused more than $1 million in damage to theprison. The detention center closed for 35 days afterward until anew 60,000-square-foot addition could be built.   Before the fire, the prison held 200 prisoners. The addition wasdesigned to hold 365 inmates, but the number of inmates was notimmediately known.   Most of the prisoners the government has contracted with thefacility to hold are illegal aliens who are serving sentences of 18months or fewer for federal crimes, said Greg Bogdan, a spokesmanfor the Federal Bureau of Prisons in Washington.   The 203 prisoners at the detention center at the time of thefire had to be transferred to other centers in Texas. The sectiondestroyed by fire is being renovated and, when it is completed, theprison will hold 500.   In July 1987, prisoners at the facility signed a lettercomplaining of violations of civil rights, Bureau of Prisonstandards and sanitation. Prisoners said in the letter that theywere offered real meat only once a week. They later complained of alack of recreation facilities.   A federal prison inspector recommended improvements in prisonemployee training.   Burnes later in 1987 said he planned to change the prisonpopulation makeup from illegal aliens to white-collar, short-termfederal prisoners.</TEXT></DOC>
