In Release 34-25801, the Commission also notedthe development of comprehensive regulatory regimes for broker-dealersin other countries, and indicated that it was weighing whether an approachcould be developed at some future point that recognized the regulationof securities professionals in a foreign country as a substitute in somedegree for U.S. broker-dealer regulation.\4\<NOTE/>   Many commenters on Release 34-2580I strongly supportedthe concept of recognition of foreign regulation.\5\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Securities Exchange Act Release No. 25801 (June 14, 1988),53 FR 23645 (``Release 34-25801''). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ 15 U.S.C. 78o(a). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Securities Exchange Act Release No. 27017 (July 11, 1989)(``Rule 15a-6 Adopting Release''). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ <T3>See </T3>Release 34-25801, 53 FR at 23652.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ A detailed summary of comments on Release 34-25801 (``CommentSummary'') has been prepared and placed in the Commission's public file,together with all comment letters received. <T3>See </T3>File No. S7-11-88. The Commission received seventeen letterscommenting on the concept of recognition of foreign regulation, all ofwhich supported the concept. These commentators included U.S. institutionalinvestors, groups representing the U.S. securities industry, foreign securitiesauthorities, and foreign broker-dealers. <T3>See </T3>Part II.D. of the Comment Summary. The Commission believes that recognition of foreign broker-dealer regulationdeserves serious consideration. Over the last decade, many institutionalinvestors have actively participated in foreign securities markets in orderto diversify their portfolios. Many foreign broker-dealers possess specialexpertise in foreign markets that would be of use to U.S. institutionalinvestors, yet they may not anticipate obtaining sufficient U.S. businessto justify registering in the United States. Recognizing foreign regulationas a substitute, in certain circumstances, for U.S. registration wouldallow certain of these foreign broker-dealers to deal with U.S. institutionalinvestors without incurring the expense of U.S. registration. This wouldsubstantially increase the access of U.S. investors to the valuable servicesthat foreign broker-dealers provide relative to foreign markets. By increasingthis access, an approach involving reliance on comparable foreign regulationand cooperation with foreign securities authorities could facilitate internationalsecurities transactions, while maintaining effective broker-dealer oversightand preserving the     essential protections of U.S. broker-dealer regulation.Such an approach would, however, raise many difficult issues that mustbe resolved in order to maintain adequate protection for U.S. investorsand markets. In addition, the concept of recognizing foreign regulationcould take many forms. To obtain more focused comment on the contours andmerits of this concept, the Commission is soliciting public comment ona conceptual approach that would exempt from U.S. broker-dealer registrationcertain comparably-regulated foreign broker-dealers who conduct a limitedbusiness from outside the United States with major U.S. institutional investors.The Commission's preliminary views on the issues raised by such an exemptionare discussed below. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Background </ITAG>A. U.S. Broker-Dealer Regulation Efficient allocation of capital requires that mechanisms exist for bringingbuyers and sellers of securities together to ensure liquidity for investorsin the capital markets. In most cases, these investors are unlikely tobe in a position to locate counterparties and effect transactions efficientlywithout the assistance of market intermediaries. In their role as marketintermediaries, broker-dealers provide services throughout the executionof a securities transaction, including providing research and advice inthe decision-making stage, implementing a decision to buy or sell by findingthe most advantageous terms and executing the transaction, arranging fordelivery of securities by the seller and payment by the buyer, and maintainingcustody of customer funds and securities. In addition, broker-dealer marketmaking and other principal activities are major sources of liquidity inthe securities markets. In using a broker-dealer to perform these functions,investors and issuers depend upon the intermediary's integrity, competence,and financial soundness.Congress has recognized the dangers both to broker-dealers' customers andto the market system as a whole when broker-dealers do not meet minimumstandards of integrity, competence, and financial soundness. Congress hasenacted a statutory scheme for regulating broker-dealers that requiresregistration with the Commission and membership in a self-regulatory organization(``SRO''), and that authorizes the Commission and the SROs to establisha comprehensive broker-dealer regulatory regime. U.S.-registered broker-dealersare required, among other things, to meet minimum standards of integrityand competency, to handle customer funds and securities safely, and tomaintain sufficient net capital to protect customers and markets from defaults.Comprehensive examination procedures by both the Commission and the SROshave been implemented to monitor broker-dealer compliance and sanctionbroker-dealers who fail to comply with these requirements. In view of the longstanding congressional emphasis on the importance ofbroker-dealer regulation in protecting investors and maintaining the integrityof the securities markets, the Commission believes that any approach recognizingforeign broker-dealer regulation should seek to facilitate internationalsecurities transactions without compromising the essential protectionsof the U.S. regulatory regime. B. Internationalization and Broker-Dealer Regulation Securities regulation in the United States, like securities regulationin most other countries, is applied primarily on a territorial basis. Whenall parties to a securities transaction are located within the same jurisdiction,as in the past was predominantly the case, it is possible to operate aneffective regulatory regime within national boundaries. Increasingly, however,issuers and investors are seeking the lowest cost of capital and the greatestreturn on investment without regard to national boundaries, and securitiesintermediaries have sought to provide the services necessary to effectsecurities transactions in which the seller, purchaser, and intermediarymay be located in two or more jurisdictions. In its recent Policy Statement on Regulation of International SecuritiesMarkets,\6\<NOTE/> the Commission outlined its views on the appropriate regulatoryresponses to increasing internationalization of the securities markets.The Commission noted that the challenge facing securities regulators isto ensure that global securities markets are efficient and honest. Whilerecognizing that major differences remain among national regulatory structures,the Commission indicated that in its view the appropriate means to reducethese differences without compromising the integrity of national regulatorystructures is through increased cooperation between national securitiesregulators as they seek common solutions to international problems. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ Securities and Exchange Commission, <T3>Policy Statement on Reoulation of International Securities Markets</T3>(November 1988), International Series Release No. 1, 43 SEC Doc. 128(March 28, 1989) (``Policy Statement''). In addition to the Policy Statementand Release 34-25801, the Commission has on several other occasions indicatedits interest in developinq approaches that would facilitate internationalsecurities transactions. <T3>See, e.g., </T3>Securities Act Release No. 6806 (October 25, 1988),53 FR 44016 (proposing Rule 144A); Securities Act Release No. 6779 (June10, 1988), 53 FR 22661 (proposing Regulation S); Securities Exchange ActRelease No. 21958 (April 18, 1985), 50 FR 16302 (request for comment onissues concerning internationalization of the world securities markets);Securities Act Release No. 6568 (February 28, 1985), 50 FR 9281 (requestfor comment on two conceptual approaches for facilitating multinationalsecurities offerings). <T3>See also Internationalization of the Securities Markets, </T3>Reportof the Staff of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to the SenateCommittee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs and the House Committeeon Energy and Commerce (July 27, 1987). <ITAG tagnum="28">Several jurisdictions have adopted or proposed approaches that makespecial provision for foreign market intermediaries in their regulatoryschemes. As noted in Release 34-25801, the U.S. Commodity Futures TradingCommission (``CFTC'') has provided an exemption from its rules for futurescommission merchants who are located outside the United States, who onlytransact business in futures traded on a foreign board of trade, and whodemonstrates that they are subject to a regulatory scheme comparable tothat of the CFTC. </ITAG><T3>See Interpretive Statement with Respect to the Commission's ExemptiveAuthority Under andSection; 30.10 of Its Rules, </T3>17 CFR Part 30, AppendixA. The United Kingdom does not require authorization of a foreign broker-dealerwithout a permanent office in the United Kingdom if the foreign broker-dealerlimits its activities to dealing with sophisticated investors and establishedcustomers. <T3>See Financial Services Act 1986, </T3>ch. 60, sch. 1, andSection; 27;<T3>The Financial Services (Unsolicited Calls) Regulation 1987, </T3>andSection;4. The Ontario Securities Commission requires only limited registrationof ``international securities dealers.'' <T3>See Revised Regulations of Ontario, </T3>Regulation 910, andSection;180. Finally, the European Economic Community has proposed an intra-communityapproach that would permit firms authorized in one member state to conductbusiness in other member states without separate authorization in thosestates. <T3>See </T3>Commission of the European Communities, <T3>Proposal for a Council Directive on investment services in the securitiesfield, </T3>COM (88) 778 (December 16, 1988), O.J. No. C43 (February 22,1989).The Commission believes that a cooperative approach to the regulation offoreign broker-dealers conducting a limited business from outside the UnitedStates with major U.S. institutional investors deserves serious consideration.By relying in certain limited circumstances on comparable foreign regulationas a substitute for U.S. regulation and on cooperation with foreign securitiesauthorities to monitor the cross border activities of these foreign broker-dealers,a cooperative approach potentially could provide U.S. institutional investorswith increased access at lower cost to the services of such broker-dealerswithout undue loss of protection for U.S. investors and markets. As noted in Release 34-25801, the exclusion of foreign firms from U.S.regulatory requirements possibly could result in risks for U.S. investorsand markets if the foreign regulatory system did not afford fundamentalprotections, or if the cross border activities of exempted broker-dealerswere not adequately monitored by either U.S. or foreign regulatory authorities.The Commission believes, however, that a properly tailored approach recognizingforeign broker-dealer regulation can accomplish its goal of maintainingeffective regulation of such cross border activities. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Conceptual Approach Recognizing Foreign Regulation </ITAG>To provide a basis for further discussion of a cooperative regulatory approachin the context of U.S. regulation of foreign broker-dealers, the Commissionis publishing for comment the concept of a conditional exemption from fullU.S. broker-dealer regulation for foreign broker-dealers operating abroad.\7\<NOTE/> The purpose of this concept release is to give notice ofthe Commission's preliminary views on how an approach recognizing foreignregulation could be developed and to elicit comment on this approach.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ A Commission exemption recognizing foreign regulationwould draw on the exemptive authority in section 15(a)(2) of the ExchangeAct. 15 U.S.C. 78o(a)(2). Section 15(a)(2) provides that ``[t]he Commission,by rule or order, as it deems consistent with the public interest and theprotection of investors, may conditionally or unconditionally exempt fromparagraph (1) of this subsection any broker or dealer or class of brokersor dealers specified in such rule or order.'' The conceptual approach reflects the Commission's awareness of securitiesregulatory developments in countries with major trading markets throughoutthe world, as well as the potential benefits of providing substantial U.S.institutional investors broader access to regulated foreign broker-dealers.In this connection, while the Commission believes that Rule 15a-6 providesan effective means for foreign broker-dealers with U.S. affiliates to provideinformation and trading assistance to U.S. institutional investors, theCommission is concerned that U.S. registration standards may unduly restrictthe access of U.S. institutional investors to unaffiliated broker-dealers.Accordingly, the conceptual approach would provide conditional exemptionsfor unaffiliated foreign broker-dealers providing cross border servicesto major U.S. institutional investors. The conceptual approach would be based on the following elements:  1. A limitation on the scope of the exemption to foreign broker-dealersoperating outside the United States whose business is predominantly foreign,who do not have U.S. broker-dealer affiliates, and who limit their activitiesrequiring U.S. broker-dealer registration to providing cross border servicesto major U.S. institutional investors. 2. The existence of investigative and financial memoranda of understanding(``MOU''), or comparable treaties, between the Commission and the foreignsecurities authority (``FSA''), that support the reliance by the Commissionon the FSA that this conceptual approach would entail. 3. The existence of a foreign regulatory regime that is comparable to thatof the United States. 4. Compliance by exempted broker-dealers with specific U.S. regulatoryrequirements deemed necessary by the Commission for the protection of U.S.investors and markets. An exemption under the conceptual approach would not depend on a foreigncountry providing reciprocal treatment to U.S. broker-dealers. The Commissioncurrently extends national treatment to foreign broker-dealers by permittingthem to operate in the United States subject to the same terms and conditionsapplicable to domestic broker-dealers. Although the Commission stronglybelieves that foreign countries should grant U.S. broker-dealers nationaltreatment, it does not make U.S. national treatment contingent on reciprocalforeign national treatment of U.S. firms. Similarly, although the Commissionencourages foreign countries to consider the concept of recognition ofU.S. broker-dealer regulation, it would not condition the U.S. exemptionon reciprocal recognition by foreign countries of U.S. regulation.The four elements that would be conditions to an exemption under the conceptualapproach are discussed more fully below.A. Restrictions on U.S.-Related ActivitiesBroker-dealer regulation is an essential, congressionally-mandated componentof the U.S. regulatory structure for protecting investors and maintainingthe integrity of the securities markets. To preserve the effectivenessof the U.S. broker-dealer regulatory regime, the Commission does not believethat an exemption recognizing foreign regulation should be made availableto foreign broker-dealers if they either (1) operate from within the territoryof the United States, whether through corporate affiliates, branches, orotherwise, or (2) conduct a significant portion of their business withU.S. investors. These foreign broker-dealers should be subject to the samerules and regulations applicable to domestic broker-dealers engaged insimilar activities. Consequently, the conceptual approach discussed inthis release contains several significant restrictions on the U.S.-relatedactivities of exempted broker-dealers. First, the conceptual approach would make an exemption recognizing foreignregulation available only to foreign broker-dealers operating outside theterritory of the United States. The primary rationale for an exemptionrecognizing foreign regulation is that an FSA can effectively regulatecertain cross border activities of broker-dealers operating from its territory.An FSA is unlikely to be able to oversee as effectively as U.S. regulatoryauthorities those elements of the securities activities of a broker-dealerconducted inside the United States.\8\<NOTE/> In this case, U.S. regulators will have much greater accessto personnel and records that are located in the United States than willthe FSA. Moreover, the Commission has a heightened interest, and governmentalcomity concerns are less, in activities that are occurring within the territorialboundaries of the United States. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ As discussed <T3>infra,</T3> note 39, the Commission is seeking comment on the extentto which an exemption recognizing foreign regulation should be availableto a foreign broker-dealer operating branches in more than one foreigncountry.In addition, the Commission does not believe that it would be appropriateto exempt foreign broker-dealers who have an affiliate conducting businessas a broker-dealer in the United States. First, Rule 15a-6 provides reliefto foreign broker-dealers with U.S. affiliates by permitting foreign associatedpersons to contact U.S. institutional investors without registration ofthe foreign broker-dealer.\9\<NOTE/> Second, exempting foreign broker-dealers with U.S. broker-dealeraffiliates could create a significant potential for inappropriate circumventionof U.S. regulatory requirements. For example, transactions generated bythe U.S. affiliate's activities inside the United States, and thereforeappropriately subject to U.S. regulation, might be ``booked'' through theexempted foreign broker-dealer, thereby avoiding U.S. requirements regardingnet capital, protection of customer funds and securities, and recordkeeping.The ability of the Commission and SROs to detect such abuse would be limited.In view of the significant connection to the U.S. market of foreign broker-dealerswith U.S. affiliates, the Commission does not believe that requiring transactionsto be booked through U.S. affiliates, as in Rule 15a-6,\10\<NOTE/> constitutes an unreasonable burden on the operations of foreignbroker-dealers.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ <T3>See</T3> 17 CFR 240.15a-6(a)(3).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ <T3>See</T3> 17 CFR 240.15a-6(a)(3)(iii). The Commission's conceptual approach also would make an exemption availableonly to broker-dealers whose business is predominantly foreign. Under thiscondition, a broker-dealer would not qualify for an exemption under theconceptual approach if its U.S.-related securities activities accountedfor more than ten percent of its revenues generated from securities activities.\11\<NOTE/> The Commission is concerned that disparities between U.S.and ``comparable'' foreign broker-dealer regulation could encourage U.S.broker-dealers to relocate offshore while continuing to deal with U.S.institutions. Conceivably, even if a broker-dealer were located outsidethe United States and its only U.S. customers were institutional investors,the broker-dealer's U.S.-related activities could account for a significantportion of its overall business. The Commission does not believe that theconceptual approach should permit this circumvention of the U.S. regulatoryscheme.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ In addition to the percentage restriction, the Commissionsolicits comment on whether the conceptual approach should include a restrictionon the dollar amount of revenues that a foreign broker-dealer could generatefrom its U.S-related securities activities without being required to registerin the United States.Finally, the Commission's conceptual approach would exempt foreign broker-dealersonly to the extent that they are dealing with major U.S. institutionalinvestors, such as U.S. institutions with more than $100,000,000 in assetsor assets under management.\12\<NOTE/> Institutional investors have been the most active U.S. participantsin foreign securities markets and therefore are most likely to seek theexpertise of foreign broker-dealers in foreign markets. Moreover, becausemajor institutions generally are more sophisticated investors than otherinvestors, they are more likely to be capable of dealing with foreign broker-dealerswho may have practices and customs different from those of U.S. broker-dealers.These investors also are generally less subject than individual investorsto common sales practice abuses, such as churning and unsuitable recommendations.This additional safeguard against foreign broker-dealer misconduct maybe important in view of the novelty of an exemptive approach that relieson foreign regulation as a substitute for U.S. regulation. As the Commissionand FSAs gain more experience in implementing an approach recognizing foreignregulation, the Commission could consider expanding the types of U.S. investorswho could be solicited by exempted broker-dealers.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ The term ``major institutional investor'' could be definedin several ways. Rule 15a-6 generally defines the term as institutionsthat have assets, or assets under management, in excess of $100,000,000.<T3>See </T3>17 CFR 240.15a-6(b)(4). The Commission solicits comment onappropriate standards for determining the types of U.S. investors thatexempted foreign broker-dealers could contact under the conceptual approach.Some commenters on Release 34-25801 suggested that the Commission adoptan approach providing an exemption for foreign broker-dealers who onlydeal with major institutional investors, regardless of the nature of theforeign regulation of the broker-dealer.\13\<NOTE/> Under present circumstances, the Commission is not inclinedto pursue this alternative. Recent experience indicates that major institutionalinvestors can benefit from the safeguards provided by the U.S. regulatorysystem.\14\<NOTE/> Further, institutional investors who specifically seek theopportunity to trade in a foreign market subject to different regulatorystandards are free to do so.\15\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\13\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>comments of the Securities Industry Association, Instituteof International Bankers, and Brown Brothers Harriman andamp; Co., on proposedRule 15a-6, summarized in Comment Summary, <T3>supra note 5. </T3><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\14\ For example, the practices of unregulated broker-dealersin the primarily institutional government securities market prompted Congressin 1986 to require registration of government securities broker-dealers.<T3>Government Securities Act of 1986, </T3>Pub. L. No. 99-571, 100 Stat.3208 (1986)(``Government Securities Act''). The failures of several governmentsecurities broker-dealers during the preceding ten years had resulted inlosses of over $900 million for their customers. The failed firms had maskedtheir financial problems by issuing false and misleading financial statements,engaging in complex transactions with affiliated entities, and improperlyhandling customer funds and securities. The interdependence of modern financialmarkets and the impact of broker-dealer failures on them were recognizedas important factors requiring adequate regulation of broker-dealers inthe government securities market: <ITAG tagnum="28">The destabilizing effects upon the financial markets of the failuresof two relatively small government securities firms must not be underestimated.For example, ESM's failure resulted in losses of over $300 million to localgovernments and certain savings and loan associations, which precipitateda depositor's run on thrift institutions in Ohio that resulted in the temporaryclosing of 71 Ohio thrift institutions. The run on Ohio thrifts precipitateda sharp rise in the price of gold in European markets and a correspondingdrop in the value of the dollar. The gold and currency markets respondedin a similar fashion after the failure of Bevill, Bresler.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">S. Rep. No. 426, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. 7-8 (1986).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\15\ For one analysis of the implications of competing regulatorystructures in the international legal environment, see SEC News Release,Remarks of Joseph A. Grundfest, Commissioner, U.S. Securities and ExchangeCommission, to the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants, London,England, <T3>Regulating the International Capita1 Markets: A New World and a NewPerspective </T3>(November 11, 1987). The Commission's conceptual approach to an exemption recognizing foreignregulation is intended to increase substantially the access of U.S. institutionalinvestors to foreign markets. At the same time, it will increase the interdependenceof U.S. and foreign markets. The increased linkage of world financial marketscan benefit investors and the capital-raising process; it also increasesthe likelihood that a problem in one national market will affect investorsbased in other markets. In view of the Commission's congressionally-mandatedresponsibility to protect investors and maintain the integrity of the U.S.securities markets, and the importance of broker-dealer regulation in thisprocess, the Commission is seeking to maintain the safeguards resultingfrom broker-dealer regulation through cooperation among securities regulatorsin recognizing international regulatory standards and reducing regulatorydifferences.B. Memoranda of Understanding The conceptual approach would require MOUs between the Commission and theFSA that provide for cooperation and coordination in regulatory, as wellas enforcement, matters. To the extent that foreign broker-dealers havedealings with U.S. investors, the conduct and financial condition of thesebroker-dealers remains of concern to the Commission. Because under theconceptual approach the FSA will be the primary regulator of exempted broker-dealers,the Commission would have to rely on the FSA for information and otherassistance necessary for the Commission to fulfill its regulatory responsibilities.Absent agreement by the FSA to provide such assistance to the Commission,broker-dealers from that FSA's jurisdiction would not qualify for an exemptionunder the conceptual approach. The essential characteristics of a comprehensive MOU providing for cooperationin enforcement matters are reflected in the Commission's existing MOUswith Canadian and Brazilian securities authorities.\1\\6\<NOTE/> These MOUs provide for the fullest mutual assistance possiblefor investigations and litigation or prosecution of cases where informationneeded by one authority is   located in the territory of another. Thisassistance includes providing access to information in official agencyfiles, taking the testimony of persons, and obtaining documents from persons.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\6\ Memorandum of Understanding between the U.S. Securitiesand Exchange Commission and the Ontario Securities Commission, the Commissiondes valeurs mobilieres du Quebec, and the British Columbia Securities Commission(January 7, 1988), International Series Release No. 6, 43 SEC Doc. 186(March 28, 1989); Memorandum of Understanding between the U.S. Securitiesand Exchange Commission and the Brazil Comissao de Valores Mobiliarios(July l, 1988), International Series Release No. 7, 43 SEC Doc. 206 (March28, 1989). In addition to cooperation in enforcement matters, an acceptable MOU forpurposes of the conceptual approach would provide for cooperation in regulatorymatters.\1\\7\<NOTE/> Under such a MOU, the FSA would agree to provide (1) periodicreports on the financial condition of exempted broker-dealers and promptnotice of financial difficulties; (2) notice of any disciplinary or otherproceedings that bear on an exempted broker-dealer's securities business;and (3) access on an as-needed basis to records and reports of an exemptedbroker-dealer that relate to transactions with U.S. customers. Since inmany foreign jurisdictions securities regulatory responsibility is sharedamong a governmental agency and self-regulatory organizations, the scopeof a satisfactory MOU would have to cover both types of regulatory authorities.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\7\ An example of a limited MOU providing for assistancein regulatory matters is the Commission's MOU with regulatory authoritiesin the United Kingdom in which the Commission and U.S. SROs agree to assistthe U.K. regulators in monitoring the financial condition of U.S. broker-dealerswith branches in the United Kingdom. <T3>See </T3>Memorandum of Understanding between the U.S. Securities andExchange Commission, the Securities and Investments Board, the self-regulatoryorganizations in the United States and the United Kingdom, and the Bankof England (August 1988). C. Comparable Foreign Regulation Because an exemption recognizing foreign regulation would substantiallyrely on the foreign regulatory regime as a substitute   for U.S. regulation,the conceptual approach envisions that the foreign regulatory regime wouldbe comparable to the U.S. regulatory system. The Commission anticipatesthat assessing the comparability of a foreign regulatory regime would requireextensive consultations with foreign regulators on a country-by- countrybasis, including comprehensive consideration of the laws and regulationsof the foreign jurisdiction. In assessing comparability, the Commission would not require that a foreignregulatory regime be identical to the U.S. regime. The Commission recognizesthat different cultures and market characteristics can result in alternativeregulatory requirements appropriate for the particular jurisdiction.\1\\8\<NOTE/> The Commission therefore would assess the foreign regulatoryregime as a whole and determine whether it adequately addressed the concernsreflected in the U.S. regulatory regime. Such an assessment inevitablywould be a complex endeavor, and the Commission solicits comment on anyprocedures, guidelines, or other suggestions commenters may have that wouldfacilitate the assessment.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\8\ <T3>See </T3>Policy Statement, 43 SEC Doc. at 129. The Commission preliminarily believes that an assessment of whether a foreignregulatory regime is comparable to that in the United States involves aconsideration of the following elements: (1) Broker-dealer registrationqualifications and conduct standards; (2) broker-dealer financial responsibilityrequirements, and procedures for protection of customer funds securities;(3)  limitations on extension of credit in securities transactions; (4)a sound clearance, settlement, and payment system; and (5) a comprehensivemonitoring and enforcement program. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Registration Qualifications and Conduct Standards </ITAG>Registration qualifications that require broker-dealers and their associatedpersons to possess minimum standards of integrity and competence are importantcomponents of the U.S. regulatory regime. U.S.-registered broker-dealersare required to disclose the identity of their owners, control persons,and associated persons, and these individuals are required to meet minimumstandards of integrity. Firms or persons who have committed securitiesviolations or other violations reflecting unfavorably on their integritymay be prohibited by the Commission from registration as securities professionalsor as owners of broker- dealers.\1\\9\<NOTE/> In addition, U.S. SROs require all personnel who providesecurities services to pass qualification examinations administered bythe SROs to demonstrate their competence to engage in the securities business.\2\\0\<NOTE/> Finally, broker-dealers are required as a condition of registrationto demonstrate that they have   sufficient financing and facilities toconduct their securities business properly.\2\\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\9\ Section 15(b)(4) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78o(b)(4),specifies events that may be grounds for disqualification from registrationas a broker-dealer, and section 3(a)(39) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C.78c(a)(39), specifies events that may be grounds for disqualification frommembership in a self-regulatory organization. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\0\ <T3>See e.g., </T3>NASD Schedules to the By-Laws, Schedule C, <T3>NASD Manual </T3>(CCH) andpara; 1785. The Commission has authority toset similar requirements pursuant to section 15(b)(7) of the Exchange Act,15 U.S.C. 78o(b)(7).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\1\ <T3>See </T3>17 CFR 240.15b1-2(c). In addition to meeting these qualifications for registration, U.S. broker-dealersand their associated persons are held to high standards of commercial honorand integrity because of the reliance placed on them by their customers.The general antifraud provisions of the Exchange Act,\2\\2\<NOTE/> Commission rules thereunder,\2\\3\<NOTE/> and SRO rules \2\\4\<NOTE/> impose both general and specific obligations on broker-dealersto deal fairly with their customers. The central U.S. elements of fairdealing involve sales practice and disclosure standards, such as havinga reasonable basis for recommendations, timely and adequate confirmationof transactions, disclosure of conflicts of interest, and fair compensationboth in agency and principal transactions. In addition, broker-dealersmust have adequate procedures for supervising the activities of their personnelto ensure that these standards of fair dealing are upheld. Similar standardsof fair dealing and supervision would appear to be necessary in order fora foreign broker-dealer regulatory structure to be substantially comparableto that of the United States.   <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\2\ Sections 10(b) and 15(c) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C.78j(b) and 78o(c). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\3\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>17 CFR 240.lOb 5; 17 CFR 240.15cl-2. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\4\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>NASD Rules of Fair Practice, <T3>NASD Manual </T3>(CCH) andpara;andpara; 2151-2200.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Financial Responsibility and Customer Protection </ITAG>Two critical aspects of U.S. broker-dealer regulation are the requirementsthat a broker-dealer maintain adequate capital for the safe conduct ofits business, and that it properly handle and safeguard customer fundsand securities. These requirements serve the important function of protectingnot only a broker-dealer's customers, but the integrity of U.S. securitiesmarkets. Rule 15c3-1\25\<NOTE/> under the Exchange Act imposes a risk-based standard thatrequires broker-dealers to maintain liquid assets in excess of their liabilities,and Rule 15c3-3\26\<NOTE/> under the Exchange Act provides for the segregation and safehandling of customer funds and securities. These rules are intended toensure that broker-dealers have sufficient capital to conduct a sound securitiesbusiness, to weather difficult business conditions, and to protect customerfunds and securities from general creditors of the broker-dealer in theevent of a sudden liquidation. In addition, the Securities Investor ProtectionCorporation administers a fund to compensate customers for losses, up tospecified amounts, arising from the financial difficulties of broker-dealers.\27\<NOTE/> Under the Commission's conceptual approach, the Commissionwould assess whether a foreign regulatory regime included provisions designedto achieve the goals of these financial responsibility and customer protectionrules. An important aspect of this assessment may be the status of customerfunds and securities under the bankruptcy laws of the foreign country.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\25\ 7 CFR 240.15c3-1.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\26\ 7 CFR 240.15c3-3.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\27\ <T3>See Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970,</T3> 15 U.S.C. 78aaa-78111.Inevitably, any foreign regulatory requirement will differ in some significantrespects from U.S. requirements. Accordingly, where a foreign jurisdiction'scapital requirements are not sufficiently comparable to certain U.S. requirements,it may be appropriate for the Commission to impose supplemental capitalrequirements as a condition for an exemption. In particular, the availabilityof an exemption could be limited to broker-dealers who have a substantialamount of net worth. For such a conditional exemption to be granted, theFSA would have to agree to monitor compliance with the supplemental requirement.The Commission requests comment on whether the imposition of a supplementalminimum net worth requirement would be appropriate. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Extension of Credit </ITAG>Regulations preventing the excessive use of credit for purchasing and carryingsecurities are an important aspect of the U.S. statutory scheme for enhancingthe soundness of individual broker-dealers, as well as the U.S. securitiesmarkets in general. Highly leveraged securities transactions can exposebroker-dealers to greater risks of customer defaults in margin accounts.In turn, customer defaults in margin accounts can substantially impairthe financial soundness of broker-dealers.\28\<NOTE/> Section 7(c) of the Exchange Act \29\<NOTE/> requires that extensions of credit by broker-dealers mustbe made in conformity with rules promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board(``FRB''). Regulation T under the Exchange Act governs the amount of initialmargin that a customer of a broker-dealer must deposit in effecting a purchaseor short sale, as well as the period of time within which the customermust make such deposit.\30\<NOTE/> In addition, SRO rules impose requirements for the amountof margin that must be maintained in customer accounts.\31\<NOTE/> Similar requirements designed to ensure prompt payment forsecurities transactions and to prevent customer defaults in margin accountsfrom adversely affecting broker-dealers would be factors to be consideredin assessing whether foreign regulatory regimes are comparable. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\28\ <T3>See The October 1987 Market Break,</T3> Report by the Division of MarketRegulation, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (February 1988), ch.5, for discussion of the impact of customer defaults on broker-dealersduring the October 1987 market break. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\29\ l5 U.S.C. 78g(c). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\30\ <T3>See</T3> 12 CFR 220.4 and 220.18. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\31\ <T3>See, e.g.,</T3> NYSE Rule 431, <T3>NYSE Guide</T3> (CCH) andpara;2431; NASD Rules of Fair Practice, AppendixA, <T3>NASD Manual</T3> (CCH) andpara;2l80A.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Clearance, Settlement, and Payment System </ITAG>The financial condition of individual broker-dealers is directly affectedby the soundness and efficiency of the clearance, settlement, and paymentsystem in which the broker-dealer participates. The paperwork crisis experiencedby U.S. broker- dealers in the late 1960's provides a noteworthy exampleof the importance of efficient clearance and settlement procedures to theoperational and financial well-being of broker-dealers.\32\<NOTE/> For this reason, the Commission has stated in the PolicyStatement that the ultimate goal for the international markets should bethe establishment of fully automated clearance and settlement systems thatpermit paperless book-entry movement of all broker-dealer and institutionalequity and debt positions.\33\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\32\ The paperwork crisis was precipitated first by an increasein transaction volume that was far beyond the capability of broker-dealersto process, and then by a downturn in the securities markets that resultedin the liquidation of over 100 broker-dealers and the merging of many others.These problems were caused by a number of factors, including weaknessesin the capital structure of broker-dealers, poor recordkeeping, and inefficientclearance and settlement systems. <T3>See Securities Industry Study,</T3> H.R. Rep. No. 1519, 92d Cong.,2d Sess. 3-13 (1972); <T3>Study of Unsafe and Unsound Practices of Brokers and Dealers,</T3>Report and Recommendations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, H.Doc. No. 231, 92d Cong., 1st Sess. 13-30 (1971). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\33\ Policy Statement, 43 SEC Doc. at 132. <T3>See also</T3> SEC News Release, Remarks of David S. Ruder, Chairman,U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, on the Group of Thirty Reporton International Clearance and Settlement (May 15, 1989) (discussion ofchanges in clearance and settlement systems that are needed to supportworldwide securities trading).In the context of an exemption recognizing foreign regulation, it wouldappear important that a foreign country's clearance, settlement, and paymentsystem be sufficient to service the volume of transactions in that country'smarkets in a timely fashion with a minimal rate of fails, and to be ableto provide secure depository facilities for the safekeeping of securities.In addition, the existence of a sound linkage between the foreign systemand the U.S. system that facilitates cross border settlements without compromisingthe essential soundness and integrity of the respective systems would appearto be a factor for comparability discussions. A sound linkage would containsafeguards to reduce the risk of default and contain potential losses.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Monitoring and Enforcement </ITAG>A further element of a comparable regulatory regime would be the monitoringand enforcement of broker-dealer compliance with the substantive requirementsof the regulatory system. In the United States, the Commission and theSROs have implemented a comprehensive program that includes recordkeeping,reporting, surveillance, inspections, and disciplinary actions. Rule 17a-3\34\<NOTE/> and Rule 17a-4 \35\<NOTE/> under the Exchange Act require broker-dealers to generateand maintain records relating to their transactions, customers, and financialcondition. Rule 17a-5 \36\<NOTE/> requires broker-dealers to report periodically on their financialcondition, with annual reports to be independently audited,\37\<NOTE/> and Rule 17a-11 \38\<NOTE/> requires special notification whenever a broker-dealer'snet capital approaches its minimum requirement. Finally, the Commissionand the SROs cooperate in monitoring the marketplaces, periodically inspectingindividual broker-dealers, and taking disciplinary action against broker-dealerswho fail to comply with the securities laws and SRO rules. Similar requirementswould be of importance in assessing the level of oversight and monitoringof broker-dealers in foreign markets. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\37\ The audit must be made in accordance with generally acceptedauditing standards, and include a review of the accounting system, internalaccounting control, and procedures for safeguarding securities. l7 CFR240.17a-5(g). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\34\ 17 CFR 240.17a-3. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\35\ 17 CFR 240.17a-4. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\36\ 17 CFR 240.17a-5. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\38\ 17 CFR 240.17a-11. <ITAG tagnum="81">6. Solicitation of Comments on Comparability </ITAG>The Commission requests comment on the attributes identified above as potentiallysignificant in assessing comparability of U.S. and foreign broker-dealerregulatory structures. Are these appropriate attributes on which to focus,or should the Commission be concerned with some subset of the attributes?Are there other significant aspects of the U.S. regulatory structure notidentified? If commentators believe that appropriate attributes have beendiscussed, how close a comparability should be required under the conceptualapproach? In addition, it is possible that the Commission could determinethat a foreign regulatory regime was substantially comparable to the U.S.regime except for certain areas. The Commission requests comment on whether,as discussed regarding minimum capital requirements, supplemental U.S.requirements should be used to address specific areas of noncomparability.D. U.S. Regulatory Requirements The final element of the Commission's conceptual approach to an exemptionrecognizing foreign regulation relates to the role of the Commission inregulating the cross border activities of exempted broker-dealers. It wouldappear to be consistent with a cooperative approach to establish specialU.S. regulatory requirements to help monitor the effectiveness of the cooperativeapproach. Accordingly, after comparability of regulatory structures hadbeen determined and an acceptable MOU was in place, as discussed above,the Commission would issue a general exemptive order for the foreign jurisdiction.An individual broker-dealer located in that jurisdiction \39\<NOTE/> then would rely on the exemption after satisfying any individualbroker-dealer requirements that the Commission adopted. In the event anexempted broker-dealer or its FSA failed to remain in compliance with anyof the conditions of the conceptual approach, the Commission would havethe discretion to withdraw the exemption from the broker-dealer or fromall broker-dealers regulated by the FSA.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\39\ In determining the country in which a broker-dealer islocated (the broker-dealer's ``home country''), the Commission would considersuch relevant factors as whether the broker-dealer is organized in thatcountry, whether the broker-dealer's main office is located in the country,and the percentage of the broker-dealer's business conducted in the country.The Commission solicits comment on the appropriateness of these factors,and whether other factors also should be included. <ITAG tagnum="28">In addition, the Commission solicits comment on the extent to whichthe conceptual approach should be applicable to the activities of a branchoffice located in a country other than an exempted broker-dealer's homecountry. Relevant considerations would appear to be whether the home country'sregulatory authorities asserted responsibility for the branch's activitiesand actively examined the branch for compliance with home country regulatoryrequirements. If a branch were regulated in part by regulatory authoritiesin the country where the branch was located, the Commission could requirethat this country, as well as the home country, satisfy the conditionsof the conceptual approach.</ITAG>The Commission preliminarily believes that an individual firm should berequired to (1) notify the Commission of its intention to avail itselfof the exemption; (2) provide evidence of its sponsorship by the FSA, includinga written indication that the firm is in good standing to conduct a securitiesbusiness in the foreign jurisdiction and that the firm's U.S.-related activitieswill be monitored by the FSA; (3) consent to service of process for proceedingsin the United States; (4) agree to provide periodic certifications to theCommission (a) that its U.S.-related securities activities account forless than ten percent of its revenues generated by securities activities,and (b) that it is otherwise in compliance with the conditions of its exemption;and (5) agree, subject to applicable laws,\40\<NOTE/> to provide records and information relating to its transactionswith U.S. customers on request of the Commission. Moreover, exempted foreignbroker-dealers could be subjected to Commission proceedings under sections15(b)(4) and 15(b)(6),\41\<NOTE/> and could be required to bar from U.S. activities any personwho was subject to a statutory disqualification or other finding specifiedin Rule 15a-6(a)(3)(ii)(B).\42\<NOTE/> These requirements may be of use even where foreign regulationis recognized because the FSA for a foreign broker-dealer may not be ina position to fully regulate the cross border activities of the broker-dealeras they relate to the United States. For cross border activities to beadequately regulated, the authorities in each jurisdiction affected shouldhave the capability to enforce compliance with applicable securities laws.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\40\ As noted above with respect to MOUs, the existence oflimitations on a broker-dealer's ability to provide requested informationto the Commission could preclude a jurisdiction's broker-dealers from qualifyingfor an exemption under the conceptual approach. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\41\ 15 U.S.C. 78o(b) (4) and (6). Section 15(b)(4) empowersthe Commission to discipline a broker-dealer for conduct that reflectsunfavorably on its fitness as a broker-dealer. Section 15(b)(6) empowersthe Commission to discipline associated persons of broker-dealers for similartypes of conduct.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\42\ 17 CFR 240.15a-6(a)(3)(ii)(B). In addition, although an exemptive approach would rely on foreign regulationas a substitute for some U.S. regulatory requirements, the general antifraudprovisions of the federal securities laws would continue to apply to theforeign broker-dealers' U.S. activities.\43\<NOTE/> Moreover, to the extent that the general exemptive orderfor a foreign jurisdiction was conditioned on broker-dealer compliancewith supplemental U.S. requirements, foreign broker-dealers would be requiredto comply with those U.S. requirements, and the Commission would be ableto monitor and enforce such compliance. The Commission seeks comment onthe need for direct regulatory provisions in light of comparable foreignregulation, and the extent to which they would derogate from the underlyingcooperative approach to regulation. The Commission also requests commenton the utility of the direct provisions discussed as part of its conceptualapproach.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\43\ In addition, exempted broker-dealers would need to ensurethat offers and sales of securities complied with the registration provisionsof the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. 77a-77aa, where applicable. <T3>See </T3>Securities Act Release No. 6779 (June 10, 1988), 53 FR 22661;Securities Act Release No. 4708 (July 9, 1964), 29 FR 98281. Moreover,the Commission's views on federal registration requirements for foreignbroker-dealers would not alter the broker-dealer registration requirementsof the various state securities statutes, which may require registrationof foreign broker-dealers acting within the jurisdiction of the states.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Request for Comment </ITAG>The Commission preliminarily believes that the conceptual approach discussedabove could be the basis for reliance in certain limited circumstanceson foreign regulation of foreign securities intermediaries in place ofcomprehensive, direct U.S. broker-dealer regulation. Comment is solicitedon the extent to which the conceptual approach achieves the objective offacilitating international securities transactions without reducing protectionsfor U.S. investors and markets. In particular, the Commission solicitscomment on whether the conceptual approach provides a workable means torealize the benefits made possible by increased comparability and cooperationin international securities regulation. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 17 CFR Part 240 </ITAG>Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Securities.<ITAG tagnum="21">By the Commission. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jonathan G.
