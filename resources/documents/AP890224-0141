Young, who like Bush once served as the U.S. ambassador to theUnited Nations, said that experience should make Bush ``moreunderstanding and more appreciative of the powerful role that theUnited Nations can play in bringing about an end to apartheid.''   Young commented during an appearance on Worldnet, the UnitedStates Information Agency's televison program in which foreignjournalists question American political figures via satellitehookups.   On another subject, Young, a former top aide to the late civilrights leader Martin Luther King Jr., was generally upbeat in hisassessment of the prospects for blacks under the Bushadministration. He said there is a ``tremendous difference'' betweenBush, who has worked with black leaders and the black community foryears, and Reagan, who ``really did not know what was going on inthe black community during most of his adult life.''   Young also said the election of former Ku Klux Klan leader DavidDuke to the Louisiana Legislature has helped Bush and RepublicanParty officials in general realize that their party has leaned toofar to the right on race relations.   Duke's election, he said, ``served as a warning to the Bushadministration and to the Republican Party that they have to makesome serious efforts not to continue to be branded in the minds ofmost Americans as subtly and unconsciously, if not consciously,racist.''   As for South Africa, Young predicted that the United Nations'role this year in supervising Namibia's peaceful transition toindependence from South Africa will help persuade the Bushadministration to support possible U.N. sanctions against SouthAfrica.   ``When they see firsthand the effectiveness of the United Nationsin that kind of situation, I think we will probably see sometimethis summer the Bush administration willing to at least engageMargaret Thatcher and Great Britain'' on the issue of U.N. sanctionsagainst South Africa, he said. The British prime minister hasopposed such sanctions.   The United States did impose some economic sanctions againstSouth Africa during the Reagan administration, but critics said theaction did not go far enough.</TEXT></DOC>
