Tomorrow, the Microsoft Corp. co-founder will demonstratethis neat trick when he unveils a program that makes it fareasier for 40 million users of personal computers to runtheir machines. The program, called Windows 3.0, promises toincrease Microsoft's already-soaring profits and cement Mr.Gates's position as the single most influential figure in thecomputer industry.</LP><TEXT>   Yet its success comes in part from the miserableperformance of Microsoft's most ambitious project ever, a newpersonal-computer operating system called OS/2. That system,introduced three years ago with the backing of mightyInternational Business Machines Corp., today languishes,showing few signs of catching on. But Microsoft doesn'tlanguish with it.   For even as he was developing OS/2, Mr. Gates kepttinkering with his &quot;Windows,&quot; a program Microsoft hadannounced seven years ago. While competitors long paidWindows little heed -- even ridiculed it -- Mr. Gatesgradually improved its power and ease of use as a new type ofcommand system.   With snazzy graphics and the power to display numerousprograms on the screen at once, Windows accommodates existingPC applications yet uses computer memory and power moreefficiently, making less-expensive PCs more useful. Now,dozens of computer manufacturers are ready to announce thatthey will buy the new Windows (it's $150 if purchased alone)from Microsoft and give a copy to every buyer of theirmachines.   Analysts expect Windows-related products to generate atleast $350 million of sales for Microsoft in the next year.The new Windows will strengthen the software company evenmore in its rivalry with Lotus Development Corp., a firm thathit a snag over the weekend when its merger with Novell Inc.fell through   The big loser in all of this could be Apple Computer Inc.,whose own easy-to-use Macintosh command system, using menusand images, made that machine a huge success. Apple is suingMicrosoft, claiming Windows is too close to Macintoshsoftware.   Mr. Gates's long struggle to make Windows work reflectstraits not often combined in a business leader: technologicalvision, a love of crafty dealmaking and an obsessive, almostchildlike personality, which drives him to seek everypossible edge. He manages to motivate employees and provoke aflow of ideas even though he often harshly criticizes workersface to face.   Despite his lack of tact, he forges alliances with rivalcompanies, overcoming occasional charges that he is ruthlessand takes unfair advantage of a potential conflict ofinterest: Microsoft both supplies the basic operatingsoftware that producers of applications programs need, andsells rival applications.   Mr. Gates hates to lose. &quot;Some of the fiercest competitionhe feels is a race with his older sister to finish a300-piece puzzle,&quot; says his mother, Mary. &quot;That's as excitingto him as putting out a new piece of software.&quot;   In Microsoft's early years, Mr. Gates was plagued byperiods of doubt or depression. &quot;There were certainly lots ofoccasions when his attitude was everything is going to hellin a handbasket,&quot; says his father, William Gates II. His moodhas been more upbeat for the past three years, buoyed byMicrosoft's huge success as both a setter of computingstandards and a purveyor of applications. Today the34-year-old Mr. Gates, as the owner of 35.8% of Microsoft, isa multibillionaire.   Yet he remains a nonstop worrier. He often rocks himselfin a chair during meetings to contain his intensity. (He saysthe habit has its roots in a boyhood overuse of a cradle anda rocking horse.) A workaholic, he can count on one hand thevacations he's taken in the past decade.   Why this racehorse pace? He is convinced that in anindustry changing so rapidly, missed opportunities areirretrievably lost -- that there won't be many second chancesin his quest to occupy computing's catbird seat. He is stillgripped with a fear he'll end up as an also-ran by missingthe next major technical wave or failing to hire a seminalprogrammer. &quot;You always have to be thinking about who iscoming to get you,&quot; he says.   Microsoft's past blunders also make Mr. Gates anxious. Thecompany mishandled its entry into the business of makingsoftware that ties PCs together; it now plans to offer animproved product and revamp its sales effort. A long campaignto get manufacturers to include an optical storage device asa basic part of the PC hasn't borne fruit. And Microsoftdecided to scrap the release of its first data-basemanagement product because so far it isn't distinctiveenough.   &quot;I'd say there's as much stuff screwed up now {atMicrosoft} as there always is,&quot; Mr. Gates frets.   Paranoia aside, he was probably born to be a high-techtycoon. He has always single-mindedly pursued his own goals.His mother used to tell him he couldn't afford gambling atcards, but &quot;he didn't pay a bit of attention, like he neverdid since he was eight,&quot; she says. He also wouldn't pick uphis clothes, even when his parents began taking them awayfrom him. &quot;We finally got down to the point where the onlyrule was `close the door' &quot; of his room, his father recalls.&quot;And he wouldn't always do that.&quot;   Even as a teen-ager, he was driven to cut deals. Beforefinishing high school he ran two small software businesses,one providing a payroll program and one interpreting trafficdata. Mr. Gates always had trouble taking a no from acustomer. He once demonstrated his traffic device to aSeattle official in his mother's dining room. When it crashedand the official lost interest, &quot;I remember Bill pleadingwith me: `Tell him, Mom, tell him it really works]' &quot; Mrs.Gates says.   At 21, he showed a zeal for capitalism that astonished hishacker peers. Personal computing was dominated those days bysocial rebels suspicious of the profit motive. But whenenthusiasts copied his personal-computer version of BASICcomputer language without paying him royalties, he wrote astinging denunciation in a leading newsletter, calling themthieves.   He's still consumed with business, and his father fears&quot;there are aspects of his life he's defaulting on, like beinga father.&quot; Mr. Gates is single and lives austerely save forhis expensive cars. &quot;We'd love to see Bill get married andhave a few kids,&quot; says Willard E. Peterson, executive vicepresident of WordPerfect Corp. &quot;We'd love to see him mellowout.&quot;   Fat chance. He is currently plotting to put his operatingsystems into fax machines and electronic notepads, and hewants Microsoft to excel in supplying databases, networkingand home-entertainment software as well. &quot;His goal is todominate every aspect of computing,&quot; says Mitch Kapor,another software pioneer.   Some of Mr. Gates's rivals fear his competitive cunning,suspecting that he induced them to throw their resources intodeveloping applications for OS/2 while he made hay producingWindows applications -- and then improved Windows so muchthey couldn't ignore it. Software firms could &quot;never be moreleery than they already are&quot; about Microsoft's intentions,says Jim Manzi, CEO of Lotus.   Mr. Gates denies misleading competitors, and argues thatfor years Microsoft encouraged software firms to write forWindows. Some, such as Lotus, didn't do so, and now can'tquickly exploit growing demand for Windows programs. Incontrast, Microsoft is likely to sell $244 million worth ofWindows applications in its fiscal year beginning July 1,predicts Shearson Lehman Hutton. Sales of the main programmay total $100 million.   Still, the drive to establish a following for Windows --even while developing OS/2 for IBM -- almost cost Mr. Gateshis prized relationship with the computer giant. Mr. Gates,who had co-founded Microsoft in 1976, didn't come to realprominence until four years later when he supplied the MS-DOSoperating program for IBM's first PC. The IBM link helpedMicrosoft set the most important PC standards, spawning anentire industry around its MS-DOS operating software. Thestandard allowed personal computers made by IBM competitorsto run the same word processors, spreadsheets or otherapplications.   &quot;It's sort of like we're this IBM lab that they don't ownor control,&quot; says Jon Shirley, who is Microsoft's president(he's retiring soon). &quot;Yet they have to work with us as ifwe're one of their own.&quot;   But on the question of how to make PCs easier to use, IBMalmost parted ways with Mr. Gates. MS-DOS is notoriouslycomplex, so in 1983 he began work on a new approach tocontrolling PCs, similar to the Apple Macintosh's. By slicingup the screen into separate and movable sections, or windows,it also lets a user switch easily from task to task.   For years, IBM ignored this &quot;Windows,&quot; instead payingMicrosoft generously to help it produce the new OS/2operating system. But last November, under pressure fromcustomers disenchanted with OS/2, IBM said people with olderor less expensive PCs should use Windows, whose following wasalready broadening.   Even today, Mr. Gates's relationship with IBM is stormy,and he can't always get Big Blue to stick with Microsoft tothe exclusion of rivals. In February, IBM said publicly thatit would offer its new family of workstations with a piece ofsystem software made by Steve Jobs's Next Inc. instead ofMicrosoft. The next month, IBM decided not to use Microsoftprinter software for its full range of computers.   Though his ties with IBM are most useful, Mr. Gates'spower rests even more in his ability to patch togetheralliances of warring industry factions. &quot;Even Microsoft can'tunilaterally impose standards on the industry,&quot; says MichaelSwavely, president of Compaq Computer Corp.'s North Americanoperations. So Mr. Gates tries to strike accords with mosteveryone of importance in the industry, making himself thefocal point of most attempts to create standards for newcomputer technologies.   But he sometimes trips on his complex web, frustratingallies. For instance, executives at Hewlett-Packard Co. werestunned last year when Microsoft struck a deal with Apple tojointly develop printer software, even though Apple has asuit pending against Microsoft. H-P has its own approach toprinter software, which it considers worthy of Microsoft'ssupport. Yet Microsoft didn't even warn H-P of the impendingdeal.   Mr. Gates is a tough negotiator. Even if Microsoft thinksit can improve its operating software with code developed byoutsiders, it won't pay a royalty. &quot;It's just bad business,&quot;Mr. Gates says, because he must sell his operating softwarecheaply. Though it rankles, some companies agree to forgocash.   Last year, for instance, Mr. Gates tried to strike a dealwith Adobe Systems Inc., which sells software to control thesize and shape of computerized type. Microsoft asked Adobefor the right to include these programs in its operatingsoftware, arguing that a linkup might vastly expand Adobe'smarkets -- but not offering any royalty money. Adobe refused.Within months, in what amounted to a declaration of waragainst Adobe, Mr. Gates joined with Apple to produce its ownsolution.   But rather than bullying rivals, Mr. Gates often gains anedge simply by outlasting or outsmarting them. Phillipe Kahn,CEO of Borland International Inc., phoned Mr. Gates lastmonth when he learned Microsoft had hired his chief ofresearch. Mr. Kahn accused Mr. Gates of violating anagreement not to steal each other's employees. The deal hadexpired, Mr. Gates said. Mr. Kahn protested, but only until acheck of his own records proved Mr. Gates right.   Mr. Gates can rattle off the specifications of dozens ofcompeting products and is known to recite claims made incompetitors' ads. He's always loath to surrender a sale. Lastmonth, hearing that a Wall Street firm was considering therival Unix operating system over OS/2, he met with the firm'sprincipals and persuaded them to delay until he couldpersonally deliver another pitch.   His persistence isn't lost on Microsoft's executives. Lastfall he publicly said that his product managers ought to wakeup thinking about their main competitor and even to know hisor her children's names and birth dates. Taking no chances,Jeff Raikes, manager of the word-processing business, askedhis counterpart at WordPerfect to send him the information.Mr. Raikes now keeps a photo of the competitor's children inhis office and has memorized their birthdays, in case Mr.Gates inquires.   Sales may be an obsession with Mr. Gates, but writing codeis closest to his heart. Discussions with Microsoft engineersresemble a legal proceeding, with Mr. Gates as prosecutingattorney. Often, he begins by asking simple questions, theninsists he understands a problem better than those assignedto solve it. At one recent meeting, he described a program as&quot;the stupidest piece of code ever written,&quot; repeatedly notingthat a tiny competitor had done a better job.   Yet he doesn't insist engineers stand on ceremony. At thesame meeting, one cradled a football while another flippedthrough a computer magazine. A third rebutted several of Mr.Gates's points with no show of reverence. Engineers tend tobe loyal to Mr. Gates because he shares their concerns andtheir sense of humor.   Even though Microsoft now has 5,000 employees, Mr. Gateskeeps in contact with its engineers by dispatching memos overthe company's electronic mail network, sometimes as many as30 in a day. After reading one a year ago, Lloyd Frinkstarted a project to develop software for notepad computersthat recognize handwriting. The project involves just sevenpeople and is one of dozens like it at Microsoft, yet Mr.Gates regularly gives tips to Mr. Frink.   Talk that Mr. Gates might someday tire of his regimen ofround-the-clock meetings and incessant travel is dismissed byclose associates. While he is less likely to indulge hisemotions these days, little else about him has changed. SaysDavid Marquardt, a Microsoft director: &quot;My great hope is thatBill will never grow up.&quot;   Maybe he won't. He still loves games. As a child, heplayed cards with his sisters to determine who did thedishes. Now, each summer Mr. Gates, his parents and twosisters hold a competition called &quot;Microgames&quot; at a summerhouse. The family invites about 90 people and divides theminto six teams, which battle it out in a series of eventswhile the Gateses look on as judges.   Bill's favorite last year was a contest to build the bestsand castle. He trucked in six tons of sand for the event.   ---              Microsoft's Financial Wizardry                                                                                                                      Applications Lead the Way...                                                                                                          1990 Revenue by business segment   TOTAL: $1.1 billion                                                                                                          Applications   Includes word processing, spread sheets .......... 52%                                                                                                          System Software   MS-DOS, Windows, OS/2 and Languages .............. 37%                                                                                                          Hardware ......................................... 11%                                                                                                          Source: Montgomery Securities                                                                                                                          Propelling Growth...                                                                                                          4-year average annual revenue growth rate, in percent                                                                                                          Oracle Systems Corp.* ............................ 65.2%                                                                                                          Microsoft Corp.* ................................. 53.4%                                                                                                          Autodesk Inc. .................................... 36.0%                                                                                                          Novell Inc.* ..................................... 28.1%                                                                                                          Lotus Development* ............................... 15.3%                                                                                                          *Estimate: Montgomery Securities</TEXT></DOC>
