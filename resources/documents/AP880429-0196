Byrd saidFriday he will call up the medium-range missile treaty for debateon ratification May 11, but only if the White House and Kremlinquickly resolve disputes over on-site inspection and other issues.   The State Department said the treaty's anti-cheating provisionsare effective but branded as unacceptable a new Sovietinterpretation of how they should work in practice.   The department renewed its call for quick Senate action toratify the treaty before President Reagan meets with Soviet leaderMikhail S. Gorbachev at the Moscow summit next month.   However, Charles E. Redman, the department spokesman, said theSoviets had taken a ``restrictive'' view of the right of the UnitedStates to inspect containers for missile components as well as toinspect Soviet medium-range missile facilities.   The State Department has raised the issue with the Soviets at asenior diplomatic level and is awaiting a reply, Redman said.   Byrd said the Soviet statement indicates to him that Moscow is``backing away'' from the mutual understanding the two sides had ofhow on-site inspection would work.   He and Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate ArmedServices Committee, said the treaty cannot be ratified before theissue is resolved.   ``I believe the Soviet Union should understand it is not a goodthing to start off by challenging a couple of the key points ofon-site inspection,'' Nunn said.   ``It is enormously important that we go into this treaty withgood faith on both sides,'' he said. ``We don't need any clouds ofbad faith hanging over it.''   Byrd emphasized that his decision to call up the treaty istentative and debate will not begin on May 11 _ less than threeweeks before the Moscow summit _ unless all areas of concern areresolved.   Byrd called on both Washington and Moscow to quickly deal withon-site inspection problems as well as other issues.   These include an ambiguity in the treaty regarding a precisedefinition as to what constitutes a weapons delivery system andwhether or not such Star Wars weapons as those using laser beams orparticle-beam generators are covered by the pact.   Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., chairman of the Senate IntelligenceCommittee, said another area of concern involves the White Houserather than the Soviets.   The problem, Boren said, is whether the administration isbacking away from a commitment to an expanded long-range investmentin spy satellites and other technical means used to verify Sovietcompliance with the terms of arms control treaties.   The intelligence panel has said that Soviet compliance with anytreaty making deep cuts in long-range strategic weapons will bedifficult unless such an investment is made.   ``Hopefully we will be able to say all of these problems havebeen resolved and we will be able to go ahead full speed from thereand these loose ends will be tied down,'' Boren said.   Byrd said he had no idea how long the ratification debate willtake once it begins.   ``We have to be absolutely certain this is a good treaty,'' hesaid. ``If we get our fingers burned on this, it isn't going toaugur well for future arms control.''   The treaty would require the destruction of U.S. and Sovietmedium-range missiles with a range of between 300 and 3,400 miles.</TEXT></DOC>
