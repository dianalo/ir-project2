The Commerce Department said that the deficit in the currentaccount shrank 12.1 percent in 1988 after hitting an all-time highof $153.96 billion in 1987.   The current account, also known as the balance of payments, isthe most important trade statistic because it measures not onlytrade in merchandise but also transactions in investments and otherservices.   For 1988, the improvement came entirely from a 21.1 percentdecline in the merchandise trade deficit, which fell to $126.5billion as a 28 percent jump in U.S. exports sales outpaced a 9percent rise in merchandise imports.   But in what many private economists called an ominousdevelopment, the nation's surplus in the investment category shrankby 76 percent last year to a tiny $4.78 billion, down from $19.76billion in 1987.   Analysts said this reflected the growing ownership by foreignersof U.S. government and corporate securities, bank deposits,factories and land. As these holdings increase, the amount of moneyforeigners earn on their U.S. investments grows as well.   ``Interest on our foreign debt is rising dramatically and theburden of financing this debt is increasing,'' said LawrenceChimerine, president of the WEFA Group, a private forecasting firmin Bala Cynwyd, Pa.   As recently as 1981, the United States ran surpluses in itscurrent account as the nation's cushion in overseas investmentearnings was enough to offset merchandise trade deficits.   But in 1985, the United States became a net debtor for the firsttime in 71 years as the value of American investments overseas weresurpassed by the value of foreign holdings in the United States.   The latest current account report showed the United Statesincreased its hold on the title as the world's largest debtor nationwith the imbalance between U.S. holdings and foreign holdings inAmerica probably topping $500 billion, up from $368 billion at theend of 1987. The government will not make its official accounting ofthe U.S. net debtor position until June.   The Bush administration, like the Reagan administration, hasmaintained that the rise in foreign investment has been beneficialto America, providing the country with needed capital to build newfactories and increase productivity.   However, many private economists worry that the growing foreigndebt load will eventually lower America's standard of living as moreand more U.S. wealth is transferred into the hands of foreigners.   ``We are continuing to borrow money from foreigners and we haveto pay them for that privilege,'' said Bruce Steinberg, senioreconomist at Merrill Lynch of New York.   The new report showed that the current account deficit for theOctober-December quarter declined by 2.1 percent to $31.9 billion,compared with a revised $32.6 billion deficit in the third quarter.   While it was the third consecutive quarterly decline, analystssaid they believed improvements in the U.S. trade deficit hadessentially stalled out with the deficit still at a very high level.   Many predicted the deficit for 1989 would show little if anyimprovement as Americans continue to buy imports at record rates.The Commerce Department will provide the first look at 1989 trade onWednesday when it releases its monthly merchandise trade report forJanuary.   The Bush administration has been taking a get-tough stance,hoping to pry open more foreign markets to U.S. goods. CommerceSecretary Robert Mosbacher told a congressional hearing on Tuesdaythat the administration wants to get the trade deficit below a $100billion annual rate in the next two years.   For the year as a whole, the $135.3 billion current accountdeficit was the smallest since a $115.1 billion imbalance in 1985.The current account last showed a surplus in 1981, when the countrytook in $6.88 billion more from foreigners than it purchased fromthem.   In addition to the $126.5 billion deficit in merchandise tradeand the $4.78 billion surplus in the services category, the $135.3billion current account deficit also reflected payments of $13.58billion in foreign aid and pensions to Americans living overseas.</TEXT></DOC>
