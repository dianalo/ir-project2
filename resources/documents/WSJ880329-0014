Salwen </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> TRN GS MO </CO><IN> HRD STK TNM TRA HHP </IN><TEXT>   Several investment managers are falling in love with Trinity Industries, a Dallas-based company that is far and away the biggest player in the rail car manufacturing and refurbishing business.    These managers are betting on a rebound in an industry so depressed that annual rail car production fell in the mid 1980s to as low as 5,000 cars from a peak of nearly 100,000 in the early 1980s. This year, the industry is expected to produce around 16,000 cars.    Trinity worked hard in the past five years to bring new meaning to the buy-low theory, scooping up dying competitors at rock-bottom prices. It was so aggressive, in fact, that Trinity currently controls an estimated 50% of the production capacity for non-passenger rail cars. Several analysts estimate that the company controls 70% of the refurbishing business as well.    &quot;In the (industry) depression, they figured out a way of buying out their competition,&quot; says Charles Minter, chief operating officer at Comstock Partners. His firm manages the Dreyfus Capital Value Fund, a large shareholder in Trinity. &quot;This in turn put Trinity in a position to benefit from an upturn. And it looks like that's starting now.&quot;    Diane Jarmusz, who runs two portfolios for Oppenheimer Management, New York, is impressed by the company's management. &quot;Even at a 16% operating rate (for the rail car unit) last year they made money,&quot; she asserts. &quot;Now there's a recovery in the railroad cycle. This company is in a very good position to benefit.&quot;    Investors tend to shrug off the company's lofty price-earnings multiple of 68, arguing that the number is calculated on weak past earnings. &quot;With a cyclical, you want to buy before the earnings move, when they don't have earnings to speak of,&quot; says Kenneth Heebner, a portfolio manager at Loomis, Sayles andamp; Co., Boston, a large Trinity shareholder.    The company's earnings have suffered in recent years. For the year ending Thursday, analysts expect Trinity to earn 80 cents to $1 a share, compared with 25 cents a share last year.    Robert Nichols, president of RNC Capital Management, Los Angeles, estimates that the company will earn $2.40 a share in fiscal 1989. That's about the same as Trinity's profit in 1982.    Mr. Minter figures that if the industry rebounds to build 40,000 cars a year and Trinity is able to boost prices about 25%, &quot;you could work out the numbers to more than $5 a share&quot; in the rail car division alone. Trinity also produces gas containers and structural products for bridges and highway guard rails and has a marine products unit.    Moreover, the company is currently using only about 30% of its capacity, which would allow it to expand quickly at relatively low cost.    The real question mark is how quickly a reticent railroad industry is willing to buy new cars, contends W. Bruce Remington, an analyst at Kirkpatrick, Pettis, Smith, Pollan in Omaha, Neb. &quot;Eventually, the railroads will have to replace cars,&quot; he says. &quot;It's more a question of timing right now.&quot;    But he warns that if the economy runs into trouble, one of the first places for belt-tightening in the railroad industry will be purchases of new cars.    The national rail industry currently has about 1.2 million cars in its fleet, according to Trinity's president and chief executive officer, W. Ray Wallace. The average age of those cars is about 16 to 18 years, he notes; &quot;replacements will have to take an increasing role just to maintain the same level of shipments&quot; in the industry, he adds.    RNC's Mr. Nichols considers Trinity a recession-proof play. &quot;We've got our eye on a mild recession in 1989. We're being very careful,&quot; he says. &quot;Trinity is the kind of company we would be looking for.&quot;    ---   Trinity Industries   (NYSE; Symbol: TRN)   Business: Makers of rail cars   Year ended March 31, 1987:   Sales: $491.1 million   Net income: $4 million; 25 cents a share   Third quarter, Dec. 31, 1987:   Per-share earnings: 26 cents vs. 7 cents   Average daily trading volume: 101,282 shares   Common shares outstanding: 17.6 million   ---   Some rumors you just get sick of. A takeover of Gillette Co. may be the longest-running speculation on Wall Street, and over the years the list of potential suitors has included almost anyone the arbs and hype artists could come up with.    On Friday Gillette shares jumped to a 52-week high as rumors surfaced about a Philip Morris bid for the Boston-based maker of razor blades and other consumer products. Yesterday, Gillette fell 1 5/8 to 45 1/8, as the rumors let up.    At least one securities firm has had enough. Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette analyst Alice Longley is recommending that Gillette shareholders lighten their positions. On fundamentals, the company's shares should sell at about the price/earnings ratio of the rest of the consumer products group, she says; the stock is at about a 20% premium.    Ms. Longley sums it up: &quot;The stock is selling now midway between its upside on a takeover and its downside on fundamentals. We suggest selling at least part of current positions.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
