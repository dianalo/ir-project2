Like the n-cube,the star graph is shown to possess rich structure and symmetry propertiesas well as many desirable fault tolerant characteristics. In addition,with regard to the important properties of degree and diameter the stargraph is shown to be markedly superior. A number of optimal algorithmson the star graph, which exploit its versatility, are presented and analyzed.Finally the inherent simplicity of the n-cube is weighed against theindicated advantages of the star graph.</TEXT></DOC>
