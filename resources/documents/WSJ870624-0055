Additionally, Total Assets said it sold one million, or about 25%, of its common shares, and warrants to buy an additional 500,000 shares at $6 each within a five-year period for $6 million. The sale gives Income Group Ltd., an Australian investment group, a potential 33% interest in Total Assets.    Total Assets, which provides integrated computer assets protection programs and services, said Income Group also will receive warrants protecting its 33% interest from future stock issuances. As part of that agreement, Total Assets said it used $2 million of proceeds from the sale to buy about a 5.5% equity interest in Netmap Corp., an Australian computer services company controlled by Income Group.    In a separate agreement, Total Assets said it granted for $1 million a license to Income Group to use company-developed technology within the Western Pacific region. Total Assets said it used the proceeds of that sale to purchase an additional equity interest in Netmap. It didn't disclose the amount of the additional interest, but added that Netmap's name would be changed to Total Assets Protection (Australia) Pty. Ltd. </TEXT></DOC>
