John Dingell,D-Mich., chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee andits investigations subcommittee.   A two-year-long investigation by the subcommittee uncoveredmillions of substandard bolts, nuts, and screws _ many of themimported from Japan _ and Dingell said the problem could havewide-ranging effects.</TEXT><DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Burmese authorities have arrested up to25 people, including a prominent critic of the authoritariangovernment and an Associated Press correspondent, U.S. officialsand other diplomats said Saturday.   The arrests came less than a week after Sein Lwin, a former armygeneral known for ruthless suppression of dissidents, replaced NeWin as president and chairman of Burma's sole political party.   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Nancy Beck said U.S.officials in Burma ``understand that perhaps as many as 25 peoplehave been arrested within the last 24 hours.''</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A quip attributed to the late Sen. EverettDirksen _ ``A billion here, a billion there, pretty soon you'retalking about real money'' _ is coming painfully true for federalbank regulators.   The $4 billion rescue of First RepublicBank Corp. of Dallas andthe closing and rescue of other banks this year will cause thegovernment insurance fund that backs deposits in commercial banksto suffer the first loss in its 54-year history.   Add in billions of dollars being spent to assist the even moretroubled savings and loan industry and it means ``real money'' _enough to hamper the government's fight to curb the massive federalbudget deficit.   FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman said the fund, which stood at$18.3 billion at the end of 1987, would likely lose close to $2billion this year. But, he cautioned, that's a ``best guess'' andthe loss could go higher.</TEXT><DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Technicians stopped a hydrogen leakand fixed a balky oxygen pump Saturday and NASA said it wouldresume a countdown on Sunday leading to the test-firing of spaceshuttle Discovery's main engines.   A countdown leading to the critical test was halted early Fridaywhen the problems developed, and the firing was postponed threedays, from Monday until Thursday.   Officials believe the engine test delays, combined with anunresolved leak in Discovery's steering thruster system, will slipDiscovery's launch date from mid-September into October.</TEXT><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The summer of '88 is already over in the mindsof countless Northeastern beach lovers revolted by a tide of deadrats, syringes and sewage that has left miles of shoreline desertedand seaside businesses shuttered even on the hottest days.   ``They finally did it _ they ruined the beach,'' said JoeLovecchi of Brooklyn. He will limit his ocean dips to ``ankles onlyfor the rest of the season.''   Others are not so brave. Attendance has plummeted at Atlanticbeaches since the scare began July 6, when needles and vials ofblood, some of which tested positive for the AIDS virus, beganwashing up along Long Island's 120-mile southern shore.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Mindful of Geraldine Ferraro's ill-fated vicepresidential quest in 1984, Michael Dukakis had aides accompanySen. Lloyd Bentsen on his first campaign solo flight.   The 67-year-old Bentsen is no stranger to campaign work, and thesilver-haired senator took several of his own aides with him on thecampaign foray to California, Nevada, New Mexico and Texas lastweek.   Officials in both the Dukakis and Bentsen camps remember howFerraro, Walter F. Mondale's running mate four years ago, hit thecampaign trail unprepared, and want to closely coordinate campaignactivities.</TEXT><DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Michael Dukakis was in Cleveland preparing forseveral interviews when he picked up a microphone and announced:``Good Evening ladies and gentlemen and welcome to Boston'shistoric Faneuil Hall for tonight's segment of `The Advocates.' Ourtopic tonight: the horrors of the Vietnam War.''   The Democratic presidential nominee was simply making amicrophone check, but he also was providing a glimpse back to hisdays as a television star, of sorts.   Ronald Reagan had his ``Death Valley Days'' when he was acandidate. Dukakis has ``The Advocates.''   The program Dukakis hosted from 1971 to 1973 and from 1978 to1980 pitted two teams, usually divided along liberal andconservative lines, against one another to debate topical issues.   The 60-minute program, broadcast on public television fromWGBH-TV studios in Boston, kept Dukakis up to date on major issues.Also, it helped him develop skills on television that he wouldlater use successfully as a candidate and a governor.</TEXT><DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Mikhail S. Gorbachev has demanded urgent actionfrom top Communist Party officials to solve the day-to-day problemsof Soviet citizens, including lack of good food and hours wastedstanding in line.   ``In our work, we have become involved with many economicaffairs, while sometimes overlooking issues directly bearing onpeople's lives,'' the Soviet leader acknowledged Friday at ameeting of the Communist Party Central Committee.   His remarks were reported Saturday by the Communist Party dailyPravda.   Gorbachev has acknowledged that until ordinary citizens' ownlives improve, many will remain unconvinced that his program for``perestroika,'' or economic and social restructuring, is working.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   As an outgrowth of the new era inSoviet-American relations, the United States has been casting a farmore benign eye toward Moscow's allies in Eastern Europe, engagingin contacts that would have seemed impossible just two years ago.   For years, Washington tended to look on the East Europeans assubmissive step children of Moscow, with little room for maneuvereither in their internal or external policies.   But since the advent of the Gorbachev era in 1985, the Reaganadministration has been quietly expanding its contacts among Eastbloc countries, especially Poland and Hungary.   These efforts bore fruit this past week with the first visitever to Washington by a Hungarian Communist Party leader and thefirst in nine years by a Polish foreign minister.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The head of Latin American studies at the U.S.Army War College says Nicaragua's Sandinista army is too strong tobe defeated by U.S.-backed Contra guerrillas and that it is time tocut a deal.   ``Half a loaf is better than no loaf at all,'' said Col. AldenM. Cunningham, who was Army attache at the U.S. Embassy inNicaragua from May 1985 until December 1986 and since then has beenDirector of Americas Studies at the war college in Carlisle, Pa.   ``I don't say that we should stop supporting the Contras,because without that the Sandinistas are not going to have anyreason to talk. The reason they are willing to talk now is becauseof the successes of the Contras,'' Cunningham said in a telephoneinterview Friday.</TEXT><DATELINE>GUATEMALA CITY (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Secretary of State George P.
