there are too many unresolved issues.andP;  We discussed the &quot;fontwars&quot; topic in our last issue.andP;  Although the font issue is far from settled,there is visible progress: we have gone from something like five contendersdown to two.andP;  But there has been progress as well on two older issues:PostScript's speed and its halftoning quality.andM;Ever faster.andP;  Several vendors showed their latest attempts to go faster.andP;  Oneanswer is to throw more silicon at the problem.andP;  Birmy introduced acontroller based on Intel's i960 RISC chip, while Harlequin gave apreliminary view of its Transputer-based parallel-computer system.andP;  A secondanswer is to handle the hard parts--the halftones--in a separate, moreefficient subsystem; Electra showed Chelgraph's GIM processor integrated witha PostScript RIP.andM;A third approach, exemplified by Birmy and Monotype, is to put sevral RIPS towork.andP;  Birmy had earlier shown its dual-RIP system.andP;  Monotype had announced amulti-RIP last spring; it exhibited its Express imagesetter equipped withdual RIPS--one for the Monotype proprietary slave language and the other forPostScript.andP;  The company also showed a Prism equipped with two PostScriptRIPs, one internal and the other outboard.andP;  (An external second PostScriptRIP will cost $26,000.)andP;  The Prism marking engine can be captured bywhichever RIP has a job ready for imaging.andM;Incidentially, although Monotype was earlier shipping PostScript controllerswith only 21 fonts (the LaserWriter 13, four weights of Monotype's Times NewRoman and four of Arial), it has now decided to expand the standard fontcomplement to include all 35 LaserWriter Plus fonts, for a total of 43bundled fonts.andM;Quality color.andP;  There is considerable discussion these days about whether itis possible to do good-quality color separations on PostScript imagesetters.andO;We doubt that this issue will be settled anytime soon, but several firms aremoving the state of the art forward.andM;Optronics announced a new halftoning algorithm, about which it will say moreafter the patent has been awarded.andP;  Birmy, Hyphen and Varityper have adoptedECRM's latest recorder, the PelBox 3000.andM;Proofs.andP;  APT and Autologic featured monochrome proof output devices.andO;Autologic, which primarily serves the newspaper market, had made its bigannouncements earlier in the year at ANPA.andP;  It again demonstrated itslarge-format proofer, the APS-LFP, which is based on the Versatec 8836 laserplotter.andP;  This device is essentially a 400-dpi laser printer, except that itis 36&quot; wide.andP;  And because it is roll-fed, it can print sheets of just aboutany reasonable length.andP;  (For example, E-size engineering drawings are 34&quot; x44&quot;.)andP;  It can be driven by any of Autologic's Page Image Processor RIPs.andM;APT's Chameleon on networkandM;Applied Publishing Technologies demonstrated its Chameleon proofing systemrunning on a Novell network.andP;  It was configured as a dedicated output stationon a network running Magna's composition software, although it should alsorun with other Novell-based systems.andP;  APT has rewritten some of its softwareto reduce the size of the code so it will fit with the networking softwarewithin the available memory.andM;The program can be set up to handle output automatically, such as in the caseof Magna, where files can be routed to a particular queue from anyworkstation on the network.andP;  The Chameleon then checks that queueperiodically (at user-specified intervals), looking for jobs to be printed.andO;The user also can sepcify that only files with a particular extension (e.g.,andO;&quot;.txt&quot; files) be output from that queue, which avoids sending program filesand other system files inadvertently.andM;During this process, commands can be embedded in the text file asinstructions to control items such as the number of copies to print, thedestination and the page orientation.andM;Besides being set up as an automatic output routine operating within theapplication program, the APT program also can be run directly from DOS.andO;Here, too, commands can be embedded.andM;Other notes.andP;  APT also announced its ability to support a typesetter'sPostScript fonts, which means that a composition system that doesn't have aPostScript driver canm be used to drive a PostScript typesetter via the APTsystem.andP;  Thus, a shop can get dual-purpose use out of the Chameleon.andP;  It canuse the Chameleon with 202-emulated fonts for proof output and keep using the202 for high resolution.andP;  And it can use the Chameleon to drive a PostScripttypesetter with true fonts and use the Chameleon proofer for low-resolutionoutput using PostScript fonts.andM;APT has switched to a hardware dongle for copy protection.andP;  The softwareinterrogates the port periodically to be sure the dongle remains present.andM;For customers with Autologic machines--the latest devices to be supported byAPT--about 500 fonts are currently available.andM;Birmy boosts speedandM;Birmy Graphics unveiled a number of additions to its product line anddescribed plans for future improvements.andM;* Birmy Pal: a 400-dpi Canon SX laser printer, driven at 400 x 800 dpi by thesame RIP that drrives the imagesetter, serves as an online proofer.andM;* Turbo RIP: a new RIPS controller, based on the Intel 960 RISC processor, issaid to be more than twice as fast as the older, Weitek-based design.andP;  At themoment, RIPS has only released a personality card (device-specific interface)for the Canon SX engine, but other cards should be out in a matter of weeks.andO;An upgrade from the older board will cost $10,000.andM;* A memory expansion card for the Turbo RIP will hold up to 40 MB, which willallow the PostScript interpreter to work at silicon speeds instead ofbuilding a page bitmap on a hard disk.andP;  The formal announcement of thisenhancement will be at IFRA next month.andM;* BirmySetter 300 TXF: Birmy is now driving the ECRM PelBox 3000, factory-setfor either of two resolution groups:andM;- 1,270 dpi at a recording speed of 8&quot;/minute or 2,540 dpi at 4&quot;/minuteandM;* - 1,524 dpi at 6.6&quot;/minute or 3,048 dpi at 3.3&quot;/minute.andM;The combination of the PelBox 3000 and a Turbo RIP with 20 MB of workingmemory will be priced at $62,500.andM;Eicon enters high-resolution ranksandM;Eicon Technology, which heretofore has been known in the 300- and 400-dpiPostScript printer market (it makes a PC add-in RIP card), is now offering ahigh-resolution PostScript imagesetter.andP;  It is based on a 2,000-dpi laserplotter developed by Eicon's sister company, Escher-Grad.andM;The PostScript version of the EG-2000 plotter is still under development;Eicon's test user is another Montreal-based firm, Ultimate Technographics,which sells PC-based composition software for commercial typographers.andP;  (Formore about Ultimate's software, see Vol.andP;  18, No.andP;  7.)andP;  However, the laserplotter itself is a working product that has been installed in four sites forCAD work using an HPGL interpreter.andM;The specs on the new plotter are interesting:andM;* Flatbed 12&quot; x 18&quot; plotterandM;* Addressability of 2,000 dpi, 18-1/2-micron spot sizeandM;* 100-sheet supply and takeup film cartridges (no darkroom needed)andM;* Imaging speed of 100 lines/second; plot time for full sheet is six minutesandM;* Capable of start/stop operation; film transport can skip empty areas forfaster operationandM;* 80286-based PC for device control and communications, with 6809coprocessors for plot and transport controlandM;* 68020-based RIP with 5 MB of RAM and Intel 82786 graphics coprocessorandM;* Price: approximately $75,000andM;Although the step up from 400-dpi plain-paper printing to 2,000-dpi filmrecording is a big one, we have been impressed with Eicon's abilities in thepast.andP;  We are looking forward to seeing the finished product.andM;Escher-Grad, Inc., 2196 32nd Avenue, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H8T 3H7; phone(514) 631-2592; fax 631-3092.andM;Electra: integration of PostScript, GIMandM;In the Electra booth, we were treated to a dmonstration of a way to obtainfast graphics in a PostScript environment.andP;  The secret: a scanned contoneimage (a TIFF file) that has been prerasterized in Chelgraph's GIM (GraphicsIntegration Module), which is a hardware halftone dot generator.andP;  ThePostScript page file includes a short sequence of commands to the GIM tomerge the halftone data into the page bitmap that the PostScript interpreterwas building.andP;  The combined bitmap is then squirted to Chelgraph's IBX 2000raster-CRT imagesetter at about the same speed as a page containing justtext.andP;  It makes for a fast, impressive demo.andM;However, there is one drawback: the page makeup program does not workdirectly with the image, so it cannot show it on the screen.andP;  Chelgraph iscurrently working on the ability to send a low-resolution EPS image back to aMacintosh front end so there will be something that the operator can see onthe screen.andM;A MAcintosh EPS file has a PostScript description of the sampled contoneimage in the data fork of the file and a screen bitmap in the resource fork.andO;The page makeupt program would display the bitmap, but it would send thePostScript description to the printer.andP;  In a Chelgraph system, however, theChelgraph interpreter would substitute its own GIM halftone for thePostScript image.andM;Copal 600 dpi.andP;  Electra and Chelgraph also offer a 600-dpi plain-paperprinter with a dual PostScript/Ace RIP.andP;  The print engine, made by Copal, israted at six pages per minute for A3 paper (roughly 11&quot;x17&quot;) or twelve pagesper minute for A4 (letter-size) paper.andP;  The controller is based on a Motorola88000 RISC processor, 4 MB of RAM and a 20-MB SCSI disk.andP;  It supports serial,parallel and LocalTalk communications.andP;  Like many another vendor, Chelgraphhas added the ability to read Adobe Type 1 fonts to its PostScriptinterpreter.andP;  The price: $27,950.andM;Unfortunately, Electra wasn't able to show the Copal unit; it is stillawaiting completion of the PostScript RIP.andP;  We have seen output previously(see The Seybold Report on Desktop Publishing, Vol.andP;  3, No.andP;  9, p. 15) andare most impressed.andP;  Moreover, the specifications of the product areattractive.andP;  We hope to see it operating at IFRA.andM;Incidentally, we were advised that the two IBX 2000 typesetters installed byTime Inc. are now operational, using an Ace driver written by Atex.andM;Harlequin running on TransputersandM;Harlequin Ltd. has written a highly portable implementation of PostScript (inC) that has already been run on Sun, Apollo, HP, MIPS, Sequent and Intergraphworkstations and will soon be released for the Macintosh.andP;  Theimplementation, called ScriptWorks, is resolution independent; Harlequin haswritten both a frame-buffer (full-page bitmap) version and a band-bufferversion, so ScriptWorks should be able to work with most marking engines.andM;Even more interesting, it has ported the code to the Inmos Trasputer seriesof parallel processor chips.andP;  HArlequin says that its code is &quot;scalable,&quot;meaning that it can be run on varying numbers of parallel processors withoutchange.andP;  Harlequin would not tell us very much about how one goes aboutmaking PostScript scalable; the firm views that knowledge as its competitiveedge.andP;  But it did say that the architecture is essentially a pipeline, and atvarious points in the execution of a program it is possible to operateduplicate pipes.andM;The significance of this development is that it makes possible much higherperformance levels than have previously been feasible.andP;  Harlequin gave us anexample: ScriptWorks running on a Sun 3 can rasterize the famous Golfer at300 dpi in about eight seconds.andP;  In a seven-Transputer computer (withassociated RAM for each processor), the same image can be rasterized in aboutone second.andP;  As the speed or resolution requirements go up, one need merelyadd more Transputer modules to keep the place.andP;  The costs of more horsepowerrise linearly as you add chips.andP;  In contrast, in a sequential machine (whichmost of the computers in the world are), going faster means higher clockrates and shorter memory access times, the costs of which rise exponentially.andM;Outer limits.andP;  Obviously, there will be some limit to how many Transputersyou can plug in; diminishing returns will set in at some point.andP;  ButHarlequin said that in early experiments, the programmers have yet todiscover where that point is.andP;  In fact, in some experiments, increasing thenumber of processors actually resulted in better-than-linear speed increases.andO;Apparently the machine wastes less time moving data around when processorsare abundant.andM;Does this approach work?andP;  At the conference, Harlequin did not demonstrateany printed output, although it did show output on the screen of a Sunworkstation.andP;  Harlequin also said that it has entered a joint developmenteffort with Inmos and will have an OEM product some time in the first quarterof 1990.andM;Hyphen sales soarandM;Although Hyphen has been established in the U.S.andP;  for scarcely six months, itreports that it has sold more than $2 million worth of imagesetters.andO;Including orders it received through Digital Technology (which markets theHyphen software RIP driving the Ultre marking engine as the SpeedSetter), ithas shipped more than 60 Ultre recorders to the U.S.andP;  market.andP;  It recentlylanded an order for 30 imagesetters from Saudi Research Co.andM;A number of technological announcements are expected this fall.andP;  Hyphen hasdevelooped an interface to the Linotype 300 marking engine, and it is workingon one for the Monotype Express and Pioneer engines.andP;  It will soon finishporting the software RIP to the SparcStation.andM;Parsing the comments.andP;  Hyphen has also added an interesting feature to itsPostScript implementation: a Comment Dictionary.andP;  Most application programsnow use the structured-comment conventions that have been established byAdobe; the comments are ignored by the PostScript interpreter, but they canbe used for spooler control, job tracking and similar functions.andP;  Hyphen isparsing these comments, matching what it finds in the job stream withkeywords in its dictionary.andP;  If it finds a match, the parser escapes out ofthe PostScript interpretive mode and executes whatever program the dictionarypoints to--in principle, any program on the computer's disk--and then returnsto PostScript mode and resumes interpreting the job stream.andP;  This is clearlya very flexible capability; it will be interesting to see commercial useHyphen puts it to.andM;Linotype to add EthernetandM;Some six months after the appearance of the RIP III, Linotype has announcedthat it will ship an Ethernet option for the RIP in 90 days.andP;  Any computerthat can use the TCP/IP protocol will be compatible with Linotype's Ethernetadapter, including most Unix workstations, Macintoshes running EtherTalk, and(with optional software) Novell file servers.andP;  The Ethernet adapter will cost$3,200 when ordered as a factory option.andP;  The price for field retrofits hasnot been finalized as we go to press, but it will be higher.andM;Series 1000 grows.andP;  Linotype also has added several productts to its Series1000 line: a Shiva Netmodem (which allows remote Macintoshes to dial into anAppleShare network), a 42-MB removable disk drive and a 600-MB (300 MB perside) write-once optical drive.andP;  Both drives are made by Infinity Systems.andM;Optronics files screening patentandM;At the Conference, Optronics made two announcements.andM;* It has filed for a patent on a new halftone-screening algorithm.andP;  Optronicsclaims that the new method can produce halftones at arbitrary screen angleswith screen frequencies from 65 to 300 lines per inch, with precise controlover dot shape and size at any laser intensity.andM;Optronics said that, in addition to using the algorithm in its own products,it would license the technology to third parties.andP;  Assuming that the patentis awarded, this should provide interesting competition for Hell, whosehalftoning patents are now being licensed by most of the vendors in the colorseparation business.andM;* Optronics, whose current PostScript implementation was written by CustomApplications, Inc., has now signed a deal with Adobe.andP;  The two films willjointly port the Adobe implementation of PostScript to the Clipper processorused in Optronics' ColorSetter 2000.andP;  (Optronics is a subsidiary ofIntergraph, which developed the Clipper chip.)andP;  No timeline was specified inthis announcement.andM;Optronics had earlier announced that it would add the ability to read AdobeType 1 and Type 3 fonts to its current product, supplementing the Bitstreamfonts now used in its CAI interpreter.andP;  It expect to have this featureavailable by the end of 1989.andM;Printware reads Type 1andM;As we reported in our issue devoted to speed tests of high-resolutionPostScript output devices, Printware has joined the ranks of PostScript clonemakers that can read Adobe's encrypted Type 1 font format.andP;  Printware saysthat it has no difficulty installing Type 1 fonts on its hard disk withstandard utility programs.andP;  Although anyone can now buy the desryption andrasterizing algorightms from the University of California, Printware did thecode-cracking itself in-house; the technological achievement stands as atestimonial to Printware's programmers.andP;  The enhancement will be part of allnewly shipped products, but for existing machines in the field it will be a$500 retrofit.andM;Varityper's imagesetter for colorandM;Like several other vendors, Varityper/Tegra has adopted the ECRM PelBox 3000and is recommending it for outputting color separation films.andP;  The company'snewest output engine, it is called the 5330 and comes in a new cabinet thatmatches the rest of the Tegra 5000 line.andP;  (The Series 5000 Image Controlleralso has a new cabinet that fits in well with the family design.)andM;To make it a PostScript imagesetter, you hook the 5330 to a model 5000 rastercontroller running the PCI emulation.andP;  (PCI, the PostScript-CompatibleInterpreter, was written for Varityper by Custom Applications.)andP;  With aresolution of 3,048 dpi, the imagesetter can render screen frequences up to180 lines per inch.andM;Configured with an 80-MB font disk, 16 MB of RAM and the PCI software, the5330/5000 combo costs $77,945.andP;  To this you can add options like more memoryand other emulators: Compugraphic 8400 slave language, Linotype Cora, etc.andO;The imagesetter, like other Varityper products, is deliverable 90 days afterplacement of the order.andM;PrintMaster printer controller.andP;  Continuing to provide free software for itscustomers, Varityper has developed a Post-Script printer control deskaccessory for use with its4300PS, 4200B-P and VT600 output devices.andP;  CalledPrintMaster, it runs in a Macintosh and allows the operator to check on thecurrent imagesetter status and manage the system setup, including specify theoutput resolution, queue jobs for output and put queued items on hold.andM;A PrintMaster user can also print a font catalog and font sample; downloadand remove fonts; open, close edit, save and send PostScript files; andselect, reset and rename a device and activate the chooser selection.andM;Scanner 1200.andP;  As we reported in our review of the current Varityper/Tegraproduct lines (see Vol.andP;  18, No.andP;  22), Varityper has integrated the Exro 7650scanner into its product line, calling it the Scanner 1200.andP;  We have obtainedsome additional information about the product and its pricing, so we willrecap some of the details here.andM;The 7650 is a &quot;smart&quot; scanner: An image-manipulation computer mounted insidethe scanner can perform a variety of enhancements on the image, such assharpening or softening edges, halftoning or de-screening, and adjustingcontrast.andP;  Varityper offers a dozen algorithms that can be downloaded from aMacintosh front end.andM;Although Varityper bills it as a 1,200-dpi scanner, we should point out thatthere is a bit of selight of hand involved there.andP;  The scanner samples animage at up to 600 dpi.andP;  But among the enhancements the internal computer canperform is pixel interpolation.andP;  There are occasions when this is a goodidea, such as in halftone generation (although it quadruples the amount ofdata that has to be moved), but it is not the same this as sampling at 1,200dpi.andM;With that said, we should also point out that the Xerox scanner is wellrespected and widely used throughout the publishing industry.andP;  Varityper ispackaging it as a complete image subsystem--the scanner, a Macintosh IIcxwith 8 MB of RAM and a 200-MB disk, a 19&quot; Radius grayscale monitor, theSuperPaint pixel editor, ImageStudio grayscale retouching program andVarityper's ImageMaster scanner-control software--for $29,000.andM;Ultre shows SCSI interfaceandM;Ultre, a division of Hell Graphic Systems, demonstrated its UltreSetter laserrecorder equipped with a SCSI interface board, permitting it to be drivenfrom workstations such as the DEC 3100 and the Next Computer, which was shownin the Siemens booth.andP;  The SCSI option is available without a hard diskbuffer or with a range of 3.5&quot; hard drives on a private internal SCSI but forpage storage and nonstop recording.andM;When driven by the Next Computer, the system is called the NexSetter--achange fron ANPA, where an early version was shown as the NextSetter.andP;  TheNext configuration is expected to be available late this year, butdistribution arrangements havent't been worked out yet.andP;  Neither Hell GraphicSystems nor Siemens, Hell's parent company, will sell the machine.andP;  Ultre,which delas only on an OEM basis, is looking for national distribution forthe Next configuration.andM;Xitron unveils 600-dpi printerandM;In one of the surprise of the show, Xitron demonstrated a new 600-dpi laserprint engine that it said had never been shown before in the U.S., althoughit has been demonstrated in Japan for several months.andP;  Manufactured byHitachi, it prints up to twelve 8.5&quot; X 11&quot; pages per minute or seven 11&quot; X17&quot; pages per minute.andP;  The engine is a &quot;write-black&quot; device.andP;  (The laserexposes areas on the drum that are to appear as black.andP;  These neutralizedareas then pick up toner to generate images on paper.)andP;  The quality looksgood, as the accompanying samples indicate.andM;One significant strength of the machine is the rated duty cycle, with issubstantially greater than that of the Panasonic engine used in the VT600.andO;The Hitachi unit is specified as producing up to 24,000 copies per month and36,000 within the life of the drum, compared to 3,000 copies per month and30,000 for the drum on the VT600.andP;  Since durability has been a question withthe VT600, the Xitron product may provide a notable benefit here.andM;Both machines use dry toner, added from a bottle rather than by inserting anew cartridge.andP;  Toner for the Hitachi machines should last about 7,000copies, we were told.andP;  The developer should be changed every 36,000 pages andthe fuser every 72,000, on the average, according to the specifications.andM;Another advantage for the Hitachi engine is that is supports two paper trays,which can be selected by commands embedded in a text file.andM;The Hitachi engine fits into the Xitron XIP product line just the way itsother engines do.andP;  The Ace RIP plugs into the unit as it arrives from Japan.andO;It supports all of the emulations of the other Xitron products, includingLinotype, Compugraphic and Autologic (to be availableon Nov. 15).andP;  Toaccommodate PostScript, Xitron has an interpreter that costs $1,000.andP;  Itisn't fully compatible with Adobe Red Book specifications, but, Xitron says,it is in use at several newspapers and has handled all of the requirementsthere.andM;At the show, Xitron demonstrated the Hitachi machine with a Xitron RIP in anew cabinet with a 20-MB disk accommodating up to 350 fonts.andP;  It can beexpanded to 80-MB capacity to hold up to 1,500 fonts.andM;The standard system, which Xitron is calling the XIP 600W, costs $27,900,including the Hitachi-based printer, the RIP and 25 Linotype fonts.andP;  Initialdeliveries are scheduled for November.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
