The Standards </ITAG>Standards of performance for new sources established under Section 111of the Clean Air Act reflect:<ITAG tagnum="20">* * * application of the best technological system of continuous emissionreduction which (taking into consideration the cost of achieving such emissionreduction, any nonair quality health and environmental impacts and energyrequirements) the Administrator determines has been adequately demonstrated[Section 111(a)(1)].</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">For convenience, this will be referred to as ``best demonstrated technology''or ``BDT.'' The promulgated standards apply to new, modified, or reconstructed spraybooths that perform surface coating of plastic parts for business machines.The standards require that these affected facilities limit VOC emissionsto no more than 1.5 kilograms of VOC per liter (kg VOC/l) of coating solidsapplied (i.e., deposited on the surface) for prime and color coats andto no more than 2.3 kg VOC/l of coating solids applied for texture andtouch-up coats. The BDT for these standards is a combination of coating formulations andapplication technologies. The BDT for prime and color coating is basedon the use of organic-solvent-based coatings containing approximately 60percent, by volume, solids as applied and sprayed at a transfer efficiency(TE) of 40 percent. The BDT for fog coating, a special type of color coating,is the application of waterborne coatings at a TE of 25 percent. The BDTfor texture and touch-up coating is the application of organic-solvent-basedcoatings containing approximately 60 percent solids at a TE of 25 percent.The standards for prime, color, texture, and touch-up coating can alsobe met by using waterborne coatings applied at a TE of 25 percent. As notedin Table 1 of the regulation, a TE of 25 percent may be assumed for airatomized spray equipment for prime, color, texture, touch-up, and fog coats;and a TE of 40 percent may be assumed for either air-assisted airless orelectrostatic air spray equipment for prime and color coats. Compliance is determined by using data on the VOC content of the coatingsapplied and of the solvents used for diluting the coatings, records ofmonthly coating consumption, and a TE value obtained from Table 1 of theregulation to calculate the VOC emissions from each type of coating usedat each affected facility during each nominal 1-month period. Data on theVOC content of the coatings applied and of the solvents used for dilutingthe coating must be determined by the use of EPA Reference Method 24. Coatershave the option of using Table 1 or demonstrating to the Administratoron a case-by-case basis that they achieve TE's higher than the assignedvalues for the spray equipment. Reports of noncompliance will be submittedon a quarterly basis; statements of compliance will be submitted on a semiannualbasis.It is important to note that the standards for surface coating of plasticparts under section 111 of the CAA are technology-based and are intendedto reflect best demonstrated technology. As described elsewhere in thispreamble, higher-efficiency application equipment has been identified aspart of BDT and the numerical level of the standards reflects the use ofthis equipment. The TE table values are based on typical or average performanceof this and other equipment. They are consistent with the data upon whichthe standards are based. They are provided to assist facilities in demonstratingcompliance with the NSPS when these technologies are used. The TE valuesare not necessarily appropriate for any purposes other than determiningcompliance with the NSPS. Such other purposes include SIP requirements,emission trading baselines, and emission reduction credit calculations.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Environmental Impacts</ITAG>There has been no change in the environmental impacts since proposal. Thepromulgated standards will reduce the national VOC emissions in 1990 fromnew, modified, and reconstructed facilities that perform exterior coatingof plastic parts for business machines by about 2,200 megagrams (Mg) (2,430tons), or 51 percent of the total emissions from affected facilities. Ina typical plant, the promulgated standards will reduce annual overall VOCemissions by 51 percent below baseline.Water pollution from waterwash spray booths will be reduced under thisnew source performance standard (NSPS) because of improved TE for primeand color coating.Solid waste generated by a typical plant will be reduced approximately25 percent below baseline discharge levels because improving TE for primeand color coating from 25 percent to 40 percent will reduce solid wastethat results from overspray.There are no noise or radiation impacts associated with these standards.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Energy Impacts</ITAG>There has been no change in energy impacts since proposal. The coatingsoutlined in the control technologies that are the basis for the regulatoryalternatives can all be cured at low temperatures and, therefore, havea negligible effect on the energy requirements for facilities that surfacecoat plastic parts for business machines. Therefore, the energy impactattributed to the standards is considered negligible.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Cost Impacts</ITAG>There has been no change in cost impacts since proposal. The initial capitalcost for a typical medium-size plant controlled to the level of the standardsis $545,000, and the annualized cost is approximately $752,000 below theregulatory baseline. The nationwide cumulative 5-year capital costs forplants covered by the standards are $23 million compared with $20 millionat the regulatory baseline. The nationwide annualized costs in the fifthyear of applicability of the standards at plants covered by the standardsare estimated to be $120 million compared with the annualized costs of$150 million at new plants with emissions at the regulatory baseline. Thetotal nationwide cost to comply with the standards in the fifth year ofapplicability is projected to be a net credit of $30 million.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Economic Impact</ITAG>As discussed, the standards result in a net annualized credit in the fifthyear. Also, in the fifth year of implementation, the standards will resultin reductions of 24 percent and 13 percent in the overall price for thesurface coating of plastic parts for business machines for small plantsand large plants, respectively. In addition, the availability of the lowercost technologies on which the standards are based could increase the amountof plastic parts coated for business machines to 24.6 million square meters(m \2\) in 1990 compared to 23.6 million m \2\ without the standards.The environmental, energy, and economic impacts are discussed in greaterdetail in the BID for the proposed standards (``Surface Coating of PlasticParts for Business Machines_Background Information for Proposed Standards''[EPA-450/3-85-019a]).In addition to the economic impact analysis, an analysis also was madeof the cost effectiveness of alternative standards to determine the alternativethat achieves the greatest emission reduction for a reasonable cost andto ensure that the controls required by this rule are reasonable relativeto other regulations. In this case, the promulgated standards will reducethe operating costs of the affected spray booths and result in a net annualizedcredit of $30 million in the fifth year compared to the baseline. Additionaldetails on costs can be found in the proposal BID.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Public Participation</ITAG>Prior to proposal of the standards, interested parties were advised bypublic notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (50 FR 12869) (April 1, 1985) of a meeting ofthe National Air Pollution Control Techniques Advisory Committee to discussthe standards recommended for proposal for the surface coating of plasticparts for business machines. This meeting was held on May 2, 1985. Themeeting was open to the public, and each attendee was given an opportunityto comment on the standards recommended for proposal.The proposed standards were published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on January 8, 1986. The preamble to the proposedstandards discussed the availability of the BID (``Surface Coating of PlasticParts for Business Machines_Background Information for Proposed Standards''[EPA-450/3-85-019a]), which describes in detail the regulatory alternativesconsidered and the impacts of those alternatives. Public comments weresolicited at the time of proposal, and copies of the proposal BID weredistributed to interested parties.The opportunity for interested persons to present data, views, or argumentsconcerning the proposed standards at a public hearing was provided. However,there were no requests to hold such a hearing, and, therefore, no hearingwas held.The public comment period was from January 8, 1986, to March 18, 1986.Five comment letters were received during the comment period concerningissues relative to the proposed standards of performance for affected spraybooths. The comments have been carefully considered, and, where determinedto be appropriate by the Administrator, changes have been made in the proposedstandards.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Significant Comments and Changes to the Proposed Standards</ITAG>Comments on the proposed standards were received from industry, one Stateair pollution control agency, and one trade association. A detailed discussionof these comments and responses can be found in the promulgation BID, whichis referred to in the <T2>ADDRESSES</T2> section of this preamble. The summary of comments andresponses in the BID serves as the basis for the revisions that have beenmade to the standards between proposal and promulgation.In response to the public comments and as a result of reevaluation by EPA,several changes have been made to the standards since proposal. Section60.721 has been amended by the addition of a definition for ``coating operation.''This definition clarifies the compliance provisions of the regulation forsituations where two or more types of coatings are applied at differenttimes at a single affected spray booth.Also, the meaning of the symbol ``T'' used in the equations to determinecompliance was revised to be the transfer efficiency for a coating operation.A symbol ``T<T2>avg</T2>'' was added to represent the volume-weighted average transferefficiency for a coating operation to ensure that the distinction is clearbetween transfer efficiency and average transfer efficiency in equationspresented later in the regulation.Section 60.722 has been clarified to state specifically that all VOC emissionsthat are caused by coatings applied in each affected facility, regardlessof the actual point of discharge of those emissions into the atmosphere,are covered by the standards and must be included when compliance withthe numerical emission limits is determined.Table 1 in andSection; 60.723 has been revised to clarify the applicabilityof the TE values for specific coating types (i.e., prime, color, texture,touch-up, and fog). Approval of alternate TE's on a case-by-case basiswill be granted by the Administrator if the owner or operator can demonstrateto the satisfaction of the Administrator that TE's other than those presentedin Table 1 are appropriate.The major comments and responses are summarized in this preamble. Mostof the comment letters contained multiple comments. The comments have beendivided into the following areas: Standards and Affected Facility, Achievabilityof the Standards, Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements, Emission ControlTechnology, Economic Impact, and Electromagnetic Interference/Radio FrequencyInterference (EMI/RFI) shielding.Standards and Affected FacilityOne commenter stated that because the affected facility is the spray booth,the standards for VOC emissions set forth in andSection; 60.722 could beinterpreted as applying only to those VOC's emitted from the spray booth.The effect of this interpretation would be to exclude VOC's that are emittedfrom outside the spray booth (i.e., flash-off area and oven) from beingcovered by the standards. To rectify this problem, the commenter suggestedthat VOC emission limits be established for the entire line (i.e., spraybooth, flash-off area, and oven) but that the reconstruction provisionsstill apply only to the spray booth.The EPA believes that the wording of the proposed standards precludes theinterpretation suggested by the commenter and, therefore, that it is unnecessaryto implement the commenter's solution. Section 60.722 of the regulationuses the language ``no affected facility <T3>shall cause</T3> the discharge into the atmosphere'' (emphasis added).The coatings application that takes place in the spray booth is clearlythe cause of VOC emissions from the flash-off area and oven. Therefore,VOC emissions from these areas are covered by the standards.The language of andSection; 60.723 of the regulation also precludes the commenter'sinterpretation. The calculations by which performance is determined includeall VOC's resulting from coatings applied in the spray booth and do notallow for the exclusion of VOC's that may be emitted from the flash-offarea and oven.However, to protect against possible misinterpretation, EPA has revisedthe regulation to specify that all VOC emissions caused by coatings appliedin each affected facility, regardless of the actual point of dischargeof emissions into the atmosphere, shall be included in determining compliancewith the emission limits. It also should be noted that because the affectedfacility remains unchanged, the reconstruction provisions still apply onlyto the spray booth.Achievability of the StandardsOne commenter stated that coatings that comply with the standards cannotachieve performance levels for abrasion, adhesion, and chemical resistance.Another commenter stated that these coatings could not meet chemical andstain resistance specifications for certain business machine uses. Thiscommenter suggested that the regulation allow variances on a case-by-casebasis if the coater can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Administratorthat no coating exists that meets both the emission limits and necessaryperformance specifications.The EPA has determined that high-solids solvent-based and waterborne coatingsthat comply with the emission limits when used with appropriate coatingapplication technologies are being used for prime, color, texture, andtouch-up coats by coaters in at least two States. These coatings have beenapproved by some original equipment manufacturers (OEM's) for performancespecifications including abrasion, adhesion, and chemical and physicalstain resistance. The EPA expects coaters to use high-solids solvent-basedcoatings to achieve compliance and has determined that these coatings areavailable for use. Waterborne coatings also can be used to meet the standardsand are available for use. For these reasons, EPA has determined that thestandards are achievable and has not revised the standards.One commenter stated that none of the waterborne primers available willachieve the standards.The EPA has determined that waterborne primers that will achieve the standardsare available for use with waterborne coatings and are being used in production.These waterborne coatings can be applied as a prime/barrier coat for certaintypes of plastic that are sensitive to direct application of solvent-basedcoatings. In many cases, waterborne coatings are not used as primers, butare applied as a color coat to the part(s) without the use of a primercoating.Recordkeeping and Reporting RequirementsOne commenter stated that recordkeeping requirements to determine complianceare excessive, particularly for large surface coating operations that coatboth plastic and metal parts with a variety of coatings. The commenteralso stated that the cost of analyzing coatings using EPA Reference Method24 could be unreasonable. He requested that the language of the standardsbe changed to allow alternate methods of compliance on a case-by-case basisfor facilities that use a large number of paint formulations. One suchmethod suggested by the commenter would allow small-volume coatings tobe grouped with a large-volume coating (i.e., 90 percent of the total coatingvolume) having similar formulation and application characteristics. Thecosts of monthly compliance testing would be reduced because it would benecessary only to test the large volume coating formulation and to measurethe total coatings volume.The time and costs associated with the recordkeeping necessary to determinecompliance with the standards have previously been evaluated by EPA andwere determined to be reasonable. Most coaters maintain operation or inventorylogs that contain at least some of the information that is required bythese standards, and some coaters are already maintaining the informationneeded to perform the calculations to determine compliance with the standards.In addition, the recordkeeping requirements, as written, are the only feasibleway for a coater to demonstrate continuous monthly compliance with thestandards. Also, in most cases, coating composition data determined byEPA Reference Method 24 can be obtained from the coating manufacturer.In rare cases such as when coaters manufacture coatings in-house or modify(e.g., add solvent to) the formulation of a purchased coating, a coatermay have to perform an EPA Reference Method 24 test in-house when suchdata are not available from an outside coating manufacturer. The cost tothe coater to perform EPA Reference Method 24 is estimated to be $200 percoating. The EPA considers this cost to be reasonable.Because the time and costs necessary to perform the compliance calculationswere determined to be reasonable and because EPA Reference Method 24 coatingcomposition data can, in most cases, be obtained from the coating manufacturer,EPA has determined that the recordkeeping and reporting requirements ofthe standards are not excessive. Therefore, the standards have not beenrevised.One commenter stated that the 1-liter sample size requested for the determinationof VOC content of each coating using EPA Reference Method 24 is unreasonable,especially in the case of specialty coatings. The commenter said that 1liter may be equivalent to the total volume of coating manufactured orsupplied for a specialty coating, whereas EPA Reference Method 24 requiresonly a 10-gram sample size. The commenter noted that the cost of manufacturingor purchasing additional paint for sample analysis alone would be unreasonable.The commenter recommended that the standards be rewritten to specify asample size of 10 grams.The sample size was set at 1 liter for several reasons: (1) Losses of thesample could occur during transfer of the sample between pieces of equipmentor sample container and equipment, (2) losses of the sample could occurduring equipment setup, and (3) additional runs of the EPA Reference Method24 tests could require additional sample in the event of problems withthe initial runs. Therefore, to account for any sample losses and for theneed for additional test runs, the sample size remains at 1 liter.Additionally, the low-volume usage of specialty coatings is expected tobe a rare occurrence. It should be noted that coaters who perform the EPAReference Method 24 test are free to use as small a volume as necessaryto conduct the test. The 1-liter sample size requirement applies when acoating sample is requested for analysis by EPA.Economic ImpactOne commenter said that because compliance coatings that will meet allperformance specifications are not available, the proposed standards wouldforce OEM's either to change to solid wall plastics with molded-in color,which would eliminate structural foam and all coatings and severely impactboth industries, or to move tooling, molding, and finishing operationsoffshore, which would result in additional loss of jobs in the alreadydepressed business machine cabinetry market as well as loss of local, State,and Federal tax revenues.The EPA has determined that both waterborne and high-solids solvent-basedcoatings that meet the standards are available and are being used by industry.In addition, EPA has performed an economic market analysis, presented inChapter 9 of the Volume I BID for this industry, that indicates that theuse of the combination of the BDT coatings and coating application equipmentwill result in a net credit to industry of $30 million/yr. Therefore, becauseBDT coatings are available and are being used and because there is a netcredit from the use of BDT coatings and application techniques, no adverseeconomic impacts are expected.   <ITAG tagnum="84">VIII. Administrative   </ITAG>The docket is an organized and complete file of all the information consideredby EPA in the development of this rulemaking. The docket is a dynamic filebecause material is added throughout the rulemaking development. The docketingsystem is intended to allow members of the public and industries involvedto readily identify and locate documents so that they can intelligentlyand effectively participate in the rulemaking process. Along with the statementof basis and purpose of the proposed and promulgated standards and EPAresponses to significant comments, the contents of the docket, except forinteragency review materials, will serve as the record in case of judicialreview [Section 307(d)(7)(A)].The effective date of this regulation is January 29, 1988. Section 111of the Clean Air Act provides that standards of performance or revisionsthereof become effective upon promulgation and apply to affected facilities,the construction or modification of which was commenced after January 8,1986, the date of proposal.   As prescribed by section 111, the promulgation of these standards is basedon the Administrator's determination that facilities that surface coatplastic parts for business machines contribute significantly to air pollutionwhich may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.In accordance with section 117 of the Act, publication of these promulgatedstandards was preceded by consultation with appropriate advisory committees,independent experts, and Federal departments and agencies.   This regulation will be reviewed 4 years from the date of promulgationas required by the Clean Air Act. This review will include an assessmentof such factors as the need for integration with other programs, the existenceof alternative methods, enforceability, improvements in emission controltechnology, and reporting requirements.   Section 317 of the Clean Air Act requires the Administrator to preparean economic impact assessment for any new source standard of performancepromulgated under section 111(b) of the Act. An economic impact assessmentwas prepared for this regulation and for other regulatory alternatives.All aspects of the assessment were considered in the formulation of thestandards to ensure that cost was carefully considered in determining BDT.The economic impact assessment is included in the BID for the proposedstandards.   Information collection requirements associated with this regulation (thoseincluded in 40 CFR Part 60, Subpart TTT) have been approved by the Officeof Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of the Paperwork ReductionAct of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq., </T3>and have been assigned OMB control number 2060-0162.  Under Executive Order 12291, EPA is required to judge whether a regulationis a ``major rule'' and, therefore, subject to the requirements of a regulatoryimpact analysis (RIA). The Agency has determined that this regulation wouldresult in none of the adverse economic effects set forth in section 1 ofthe Order as grounds for finding a regulation to be a ``major rule.'' Theregulation results in a net annual credit to the industry, and no priceincreases are expected. The Agency has concluded, therefore, that thisregulation is not a ``major rule'' under Executive Order 12291.   The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires the identification of potentiallyadverse impacts of Federal regulations upon small business entities. TheAct specifically requires the completion of a Regulatory Flexibility Analysisin those instances where small business impacts are possible. Because thesestandards impose no adverse economic impacts, a Regulatory FlexibilityAnalysis has not been conducted.   Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that thisrule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial numberof small entities.   <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 60   </ITAG>Air pollution control, Intergovernmental relations, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements, Incorporation by reference, Surface coating of plastic partsfor business machines. <ITAG tagnum="21">Date: January 13, 1988.    </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Lee M.
