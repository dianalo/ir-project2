Inc. has taken its battle forFederated Department Stores Inc. to the marketplace and to thecourts.   Macy, which last week agreed to a $6.1 billion buyout ofFederated, on Tuesday began a tender offer for 80 percent of theCincinnati-based retailer's common stock.   Macy also asked a federal court for an injunction to block therival $6.18 billion buyout offer from Campeau Corp., contendingCampeau's bid _ which was revised from an earlier offer _ actuallyconstituted a new offer and as such must remain open beyond itsscheduled expiration at midnight EST March 15.   Extending Campeau's bid would reduce the pressure on Federatedshareholders to decide between the rival Macy and Campeau offers,effectively putting the Macy offer _ which expires April 4 _ onmore equal footing.   Campeau, a Toronto-based real estate developer and retailer, isoffering $75 in cash per share for 80 percent of Federated's stockand $44 in cash per share for the remaining 20 percent. The Campeaubid, which has an aggregate value of $68 per share, totals $6.18billion.   Until March 2, when Campeau officially announced its two-tierbid, the company had offered $68 in cash outright for each ofFederated's 89.6 million outstanding shares.   ``In order to increase the pressure on Federate's stockholders,defendants have unlawfully treated their new two-tier offer as a`mere' amendment to their prior tender offer,'' Macy contended incourt papers.   Because of the two-stage price structure, Campeau's latestproposal bears little resemblance to its original bid and shouldtherefore be treated as a new offer, Macy argued.   Under federal law, a new offer would have to remain open for atleast 20 business days after publication or submission tostockholders. If Campeau's bid is considered a new offer, it couldnot legally expire on March 15 as scheduled.   Macy asked the court to block the Campeau offer from closingbefore stockholders had a sufficient amount of time to reviewmaterials and to evaluate the changes included in the new bid.   Macy's tender offer will pay $74.50 per share in cash for up to70.43 million shares, or approximately 80 percent of Federatedcommon stock. Macy plans to swap shares in a new company,Macy's-Federated Inc., for the remaining 20 percent of Federated'sshares.   The Macy offer expires at midnight EST April 4. Analystsestimate it is worth $6.1 billion.   Macy revealed in a filing with the Securities and ExchangeCommission Tuesday that under the Macy-Federated agreement,Federated executives have the option of being paid in cash for allof their shares in the company, instead of the cash-and-stock offerbeing made to the public. The price to be paid for the executives'stock was $73.80 per share, slightly less than the cash price inthe tender offer.   Federated stock was up 37{ cents to $66.37{ a share in early NewYork Stock Exchange trading today.   In a separate SEC filing Monday detailing its latest bid,Campeau revealed that Federated had received six offers for itsRalphs supermarkets division in California. The bids ranged from$800 million to $990 million, including a $955 million offer byRalphs management, Campeau said.   Macy also said in its SEC filing that it expected Ralphs to besold.   Whoever ends up acquiring Federated is also likely to sell thecompany's other non-department store divisions, Gold Circlediscount stores and Main Street and Children's Place specialtystores.   Campeau announced last week it had agreed to sell Federated'sFoley's and Filene's department store divisions to the MayDepartment Stores Co. if its tender offer succeeded.   Federated, the nation's fifth-largest retailer, also ownsdepartment stores including Bloomingdale's, Lazarus, Rich's,Abraham andamp; Straus, Bullock's and Burdine's.   In its SEC filing, Macy said it expected some department storedivisions would be sold, but it did not elaborate. Analysts expectMacy, which has nearly 100 department and specialty stores of itsown, to sell Federated Rich's and Abraham andamp; Straus divisions.</TEXT></DOC>
