<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-93-1042 </DOCNO><TEXT>The world's largest wind power plant GROWIAN (100 m tower/100.4 m rotordiameter, 3 MWel at 12 m/s wind speed) allowed to test major operatingstates and gain valuable knowledge although it was operated for a mere420 h due to structural weaknesses at the hub (which required reinforcementseveral times over). Based on the experience gained with this singularplant as to its dimensions, a medium-sized wind power plant (WK-60) wasdeveloped (60 m rotor diameter/triple-blade rotor/46 m hub height/1.2MW) intended for being sited on the Heligoland island and for covering30% of the island's power supply. In addition, the author presents smallwind power converters type AEROMAN (12.5 rotor diameter/16 m hub height/10kW) which were installed and tested in 17 R and D facilities world-wide(desalination plants, pump drives, combined wind/photovoltaics).
