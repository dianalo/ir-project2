The Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen about 16% since its October low, and many other exchanges have also recovered some of their losses. But Vancouver, which specializes in the trading of highly speculative penny stocks issued by junior gold exploration companies, has seen only trouble.    On Friday, the exchange's index closed at 1013.77, down 1.96 points from Thursday and down about 10% since October. The index, which measures the movement of all Vancouver's 2,500 stocks, hasn't been lower since early 1985. Observers say investors have become too cautious for Vancouver's high-risk stocks, and that a lackluster bullion market is hurting gold-mining issues, especially junior companies whose main assets are unproven mineral claims.    So far, the city's perennially optimistic brokerage houses have taken the slump in stride, even though the value of stocks traded in the 1988 first half was only 1.8 billion Canadian dollars (US $1.48 billion), a 50% decline from the first half of 1987. Layoffs aren't common, and some firms are actually expanding while counting on higher gold prices or new gold discoveries to turn the market around.    But in the meantime Vancouver, which attracts about 25% of its business from the U.S., is losing its status as a major venture capital market, says Adrian du Plessis, a local financial researcher and former stock exchange floor trader. In the 1988 first half, he says, Vancouver accounted for just 3.9% of the stock value traded in Canada, down from 5.2% a year earlier. &quot;You can only sell a faulty product for so long,&quot; he says.    John Woods, editor of Stockwatch, a daily Vancouver market newssheet, adds that the exchange is suffering from a general lack of interest in speculative stocks and from an &quot;unprecedented bout of revolting publicity that has shaken investor confidence.&quot;    The most recent blow to the local market was a decision last month by Penny Stock News of Columbia, Md., to stop listing Vancouver stock quotes and to stop writing about the exchange. The newspaper, a bimonthly publication with 60,000 paid subscribers, is facing a revenue squeeze of its own and has been forced to cut back its coverage, says managing editor Theresa O'Neil.    She adds that subscribers appeared suspicious of the &quot;different trading climate&quot; in Vancouver, where stock activity is &quot;more erratic than in the U.S.&quot; In Vancouver, the only non-U.S. market covered by the newspaper, stocks often move sharply for reasons that are never explained, she says. &quot;It's good for insiders but lousy if you are on the outside.&quot;    One still-fresh Vancouver scandal involves International Tillex Enterprises Ltd., a New York-based insurance and mining concern that was delisted in 1987 after disclosing that its auditors' working papers were &quot;stolen&quot; from the company's headquarters. Tillex, whose stock had soared to more than 77 Canadian dollars a share in 1986 from an issue price of 20 cents in 1984, also disclosed that its auditors had found &quot;non-arms-length transactions which create valuation questions.&quot;    This year, a civil trial called into question the ethics of Vancouver's stock traders. The trial judge said two promoters and various colleagues manipulated the trading of about 15 Vancouver-listed stocks in 1984 and 1985, while bribing the manager of a Texas-based mutual fund to invest in the shares. The judge, who ordered the promoters to repay US$12.2 million to the fund, said local brokerage houses &quot;related in spirit to the three monkeys&quot; closed their eyes, ears and mouths to the fraud.    Even so, Vancouver brokers are looking ahead to better times. Grant Macdonald, president of the local firm Continental Securities, says he added about 20 brokers to the staff in the past nine months and is looking for more &quot;if we can find good people.&quot; Continental, which currently has about 100 sales representatives, sees a stronger market coming this fall, Mr. Macdonald says. He adds that the current lull is &quot;a good time to improve staff and services.&quot;    Page Chilcott, president of Vancouver-based broker C.M. Oliver and Co., says he isn't laying off employees. He says intensive gold exploration is currently under way in British Columbia and the Yukon Territory, and &quot;someone may come up with something interesting.&quot; He says he is looking for a turnaround in the fall or winter, as assay results reach the market.    Canarim Investment Corp., the city's biggest brokerage house, says it has added about 40 employees in Vancouver this year as part of a broader expansion that has also taken the company to Toronto. Brian Harwood, Canarim's president, says he is optimistic about a &quot;late fall rally in Vancouver.&quot;    Donald Hudson, president of the Vancouver Stock Exchange, says he hasn't laid off any of his 350 employees, even though the retail trading that the exchange relies on is &quot;extremely slow.&quot; He says he is encouraged by the strong North American economy, which prompted 165 new companies to list in Vancouver during the 1988 first half, up from 149 new listings a year earlier. He also discounts the impact of the Penny Stock News cutback, saying &quot;we won't suffer.&quot; He adds, &quot;When the market comes back, it will be interesting to see if they start covering us again.&quot;    ---   World Market Activity   The Tokyo stock market continued to slumber on Friday.    With most Japanese heading for their August vacations, Tokyo Stock Exchange had one of its quietest days this year. The Nikkei index of 225 stocks edged up 48.53 points to close the day at 27,833.51. Volume on the first section of the stock exchange was estimated at 500 million shares, down from Thursday's 600 million shares. That would be the slowest full day of trading this year, about half normal volume.    The Nikkei has now risen 278.64 points since plummeting 615.49 points Wednesday, its sharpest single-day decline this year.    The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the first section, which rose 16.63 points Thursday, slipped 2.39 points to close at 2,187.04.    In trading in Tokyo Monday, shares firmed and at the close of the morning session the Nikkei index stood at 27886.49, up 52.98 points.    Traders attributed Friday's low turnover primarily to the beginning of the Obon holidays and a reluctance to make major trades with the market closed Saturday. But at the same time, they said that some investors are nervous about committing to the stock market before the release tomorrow of the U.S. trade figures for June.    London stocks rose in moderate trading on Friday as sterling's strength eased fears of a further rise in interest rates soon.    The Financial Times 100-Share Index rose 8.2 points to 1843.4. The narrower FT30 rose 7.2 to 1484.8. Volume was 495 million shares, compared with 465.4 million a day earlier.    London stocks opened higher following rises in Tokyo and on Wall Street. Stocks rose as high as 10.9 points just before 11:00 a.m., largely on continuing takeover speculation. They fell in the afternoon as Wall Street declined in early trading.    Share prices on the Frankfurt stock exchange recovered a bit in calm dealings from a string of three consecutive declining sessions. Investors cautiously returned to the market after selling off stocks in the wake of the half-point rise in the U.S. discount rate Tuesday, brokers said.    In other markets, share prices rose to new highs in Taipei, were higher in Sydney and Seoul, mixed in Hong Kong and Wellington and lower in Singapore and Manila.    Share prices rose in Amsterdam, Brussels, Johannesburg, Milan, and Stockholm; and were mixed in Paris and Zurich.    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The percentage change is since year-end.                                                    % This                              Aug 11    Aug 10      Year U.S. ........................ 242.1     241.4     +  5.5 Britain ..................... 555.0     555.8     +  7.6 Canada ...................... 356.6     356.2     +  1.7 Japan ...................... 1294.0    1280.8     + 26.6 France ...................... 361.4     365.5     + 25.2 Germany ..................... 180.9     183.1     + 15.6 Hong Kong .................. 1913.4    1906.7     + 16.4 Switzerland ................. 160.4     162.4     + 14.0 Australia ................... 320.2     321.9     + 23.5 World index ................. 441.4     438.1     +  8.2</TEXT></DOC>
