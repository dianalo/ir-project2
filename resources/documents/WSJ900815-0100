Texaco officials expect to begin almost immediately afeasibility study defining joint production possibilities.The study will focus on the Timan-Pechora region, whichencompasses a number of potential oilfields straddling theArctic Circle. Reserves there are estimated at about fivebillion barrels of oil. On that basis, the region could equalmany of the huge fields that make up North Sea oilproduction, industry experts estimate.</LP><TEXT>   In addition, Texaco officials said they were negotiatingto secure opportunities in the refining and marketing sectorof Soviet business. An agreement hasn't yet been reached, andTexaco wouldn't elaborate.   &quot;This is a significant opportunity; we need each other,&quot;said Harold Zimmerman, Texaco general manager of explorationand production who has taken part in the negotiations withthe Soviet Union.   In light of the oil crisis in the Persian Gulf region, &quot;itoffers potential for another supply of crude,&quot; he said.&quot;Under one production scheme the field could yield oil byearly 1992 or 1993.&quot;   The Soviet Union is the world's largest producer of oil,with output currently around 12 million barrels a day.Because of its weakening economy, however, the country hashad trouble properly maintaining its existing oil fields andhasn't had financial resources to develop what are believedto be vast amounts of undiscovered oil and natural gas. Ifthe Soviet Union can attract foreign investment to helpimprove production, it also may be able to raise more badlyneeded hard currency through oil exports.   Texaco joins a growing list of major oil companies seekingopportunities in the Soviet Union. Chevron Corp. and ElfAquitaine, the French petroleum company, both recentlyconcluded agreements granting them exploration and productionrights. Many other oil companies are in negotiations,including British Petroleum Co.   Texaco claimed its agreement with the Soviets isespecially broad, encompassing a larger initial geographicalarea than those being explored by other oil companies andallowing for study of potential operations in other regions.   Texaco said no money has changed hands; a productionagreement is being negotiated. As a result, the company saidit isn't certain yet how much it may actually spend in theSoviet Union. The company said those negotiations will runconcurrently with the drilling feasibility study about tobegin. Texaco officials expect the study to take about ninemonths, and if that is successful, they believe they couldalmost immediately set a drilling and production schedule.   &quot;The Timan-Pechora region holds significant potential forearly production,&quot; said Paul B. Hicks Jr., president ofTexaco Europe.   As part of the overall agreement, Texaco will cooperate ongeological research with the Soviet Ministry of Geology,including the supplying and installing computer facilities atthe ministry's Moscow offices. Texaco will also help trainSoviet personnel.   In advance of yesterday's agreement, Soviet oil officialshave spent several weeks in Texaco offices in Houston and atthe company's Harrison, N.Y., headquarters. In Houston, theSoviets examined computer facilities. In Harrison, thedirector general of the ministry and others engaged in atwo-week business seminar. &quot;Basically they were learningWestern business ways -- the basic financials of running anoil business,&quot; said Mr. Zimmerman.   Texaco began its quest in the Soviet Union by purchasingfour of six geological data packages offered by a Londonbroker licensed by the Soviet Union to sell such informationon its oil regions. Texaco paid about $750,000 for eachpackage. Packages are still being offered and Texacoofficials estimated they now go for $1 million each.   Although acquiring access to Soviet oil is desirable, itcan be &quot;frustrating,&quot; said Mr. Zimmerman. Talks &quot;don't unfoldlike they do in Western negotiations; there's a lot morebureaucracy. There are problems knowing who in the Sovietgovernment has control over what resources.&quot;   Texaco decided to center its exploration on potential oilfields west of the Ural mountains. Company officials saidthat better infrastructure exists there and with it chancesfor earlier production. The eastern sectors were consideredtoo remote.</TEXT></DOC>
