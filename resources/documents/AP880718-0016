Roald Z. Sagdeev, director of the Soviet Space ResearchInstitute and a member of the USSR Academy of Sciences, says abureaucracy led by ``comically obtuse leaders'' with littleunderstanding of science has stifled Soviet research for decadesand left science there weak and unproductive.   Sagdeev, writing in the quarterly journal, Issues in Science andTechnology, said the Soviets can be ``justly proud'' ofcontributions to the study of the laser, the launching of Sputnikand of subsequent achievements in space.   But because of ``ill-conceived'' government policies, ``duringthe past half century, Soviet science has suffered deep, and stillbleeding, wounds,'' said Sagdeev, who is a key science adviser toSoviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.   ``Exaggerated claims have been made for the achievements ofSoviet science,'' Sagdeev said. ``Science has its own criteria forsuccess, however, and Soviet achievements have not measured up tothem.''   He said science has failed to strengthen industrial productivitybecause ``we have not faced up to the real problem: Sovietfundamental science is too weak to contribute much to practicalapplications.''   ``The shortcomings in Soviet science are apparent from thesubatomic world of physics to the boundless world of astronomy,''he said. Soviet scientists, Sagdeev said, have contributed littleor nothing to the recent new discoveries in atomic physics, inastronomy or in biology.   A leading problem is that few Soviet scientists have access tocomputers, Sagdeev said, while scientists in other countries usethem routinely. When the Soviets planned to send a satellite toHalley's comet, scientists in the Soviet Space Research Institutehad to build a computer because such a machine is not made bySoviet industry, he said.   ``While researchers around the world are taking advantage ofthese magnificent tools (computers), Soviet research workers andengineers resemble soldiers attempting to fight a modern war withcrossbows,'' he said.   He said since World War II, Soviet attempts at major scienceprojects have been increasingly dragged down by bureaucraticmachinery that smothers original research.   Department barriers, he said, keep laboratory researchers fromcommunicating with students, thus handicapping the Sovietproduction of new scientists.   Bureaucrats attempted to apply central production planningtechniques to science research, said Sagdeev, often with ludicrousresults.   ``In the 1960s, scientists even had to promise to achieve aspecific amount of progress within a designated period,'' he said.Some physicists, ``recognizing the absurdity of the exercise,pledged to make one discovery of worldwide importance, twodiscoveries of all-Union importance and three ... of Siberianimportance to please political leaders at all levels.''   While scientists, he said, saw this as nonsense, ``politicalleaders can be comically obtuse.''   ``French, German and American science is vibrant with new ideas,while Soviet science is stultifying,'' he said.   Sagdeev has published similar criticisms in Soviet publications.   The National Academy of Sciences said Sagdeev wrote andsubmitted the article for U.S. publication in Issues, which ispublished by the academy, the National Academy of Engineering andthe Institute of Medicine.</TEXT></DOC>
