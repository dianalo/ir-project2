He calls the results &quot;startling,&quot; and says they will cause many &quot;headaches&quot; in domestic and international issues facing Korea, but adds, &quot;I am quite confident we can manage this situation with effort on all sides and with the mature political awareness of the people.&quot; Mr. Roh's comments came in an interview with editors and reporters of The Wall Street Journal. He seemed relaxed and reflective at the end of a tumultuous week in which his party captured only 125 of 299 seats in the National Assembly and his victorious opponents crowed about their plans for setting the nation's agenda.    In less than one year, Korea has gone from an authoritarian regime to a nascent democracy in which power is about to be shared between a president and a legislature dominated by his political opponents.    Mr. Roh, who may well wish that Korea hadn't progressed quite so far so fast, notes philosophically that such power-sharing also exists in the U.S. &quot;It gives some headaches to the government, but the democratic process goes on. This will be true here, too,&quot; he says.    The president says he doesn't expect major difficulties in getting the government's program enacted, although he does foresee problems if the opposition seeks to force through its programs without consultation with the government. He noted that, like an American president, he has veto power and is prepared to use it.    Aides to the president also say that Mr. Roh plans to revamp his cabinet and his party leadership to give his administration a more moderate image for its dealings with the opposition.    Mr. Roh says he intends to hold opposition leaders to earlier promises that they wouldn't use their political power to exact retribution against former President Chun Doo Hwan, whose family has recently been implicated in scandals involving corruption and abuse of power.    Asked about the prospect of Mr. Chun being forced to flee like Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines, Mr. Roh says, &quot;It can never happen here.&quot;    Mr. Roh acknowledges that the opposition's victory will complicate U.S.-Korean trade frictions. &quot;In view of the traditional opposition mentality, I would foresee some difficulties,&quot; he says. &quot;This will bind the hands of government in certain ways in solving these problems.&quot;    There is widespread public resentment in Korea at what is perceived as heavy-handed U.S. pressure on Korea to open its markets to American products. Mr. Roh attributes much of this resentment to misperception by the Korean public.    &quot;According to the general perception -- misperception in a way -- people tend to think Korea is still suffering from hardship and foreign debt, and the U.S. seems to be a giant with a lot of resources to overcome its transitional difficulties easily,&quot; he says. &quot;That is the perception. But we have passed the {trade} deficit stage and come into surplus, but people don't realize our economic fortunes have changed. So their response to this kind of U.S. pressure is very negative. It's expressed in anti-American feelings.&quot;    Mr. Roh adds, &quot;It will take some time, but we have to enlighten the people about this changed situation.&quot;    The president also notes dangerous misperceptions on the American side. &quot;Some people in America believe South Korea is a second Japan, as if South Korea had accumulated trade surpluses over many years,&quot; he says.    Despite rising public debate in both Korea and the U.S. over keeping more than 40,000 American troops here, Mr. Roh seems to expect fewer problems on the security issue than on trade issues. He supports the continued presence of the troops and says he is &quot;happy&quot; about progress in Korean-U.S. security consultations.    He embraces the U.S. position that the American troops here play a wider role. &quot;They are not only here to defend South Korea against North Korea. We have to have a wider conception. They are for the defense of free Asia against an external threat,&quot; he says.    He notes that in the &quot;backyard&quot; of North Korea is a &quot;great Soviet military concentration&quot; and that this leads to an &quot;imbalance of power in East Asia.&quot; Implicitly addressing a growing American demand that Korea share more of the economic burden of regional defense, Mr. Roh says his country already &quot;plays a wider, bigger role than its own defense. We are shouldering, sharing, a lot of security burden with our American allies.&quot;    Asked about Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis's comments about pulling U.S. troops from Korea, Mr. Roh smiles and says, &quot;During elections, those who aren't responsible for policy can freely talk about issues. As soon as they assume government responsibility they must be more responsible.&quot; He cites the example of Jimmy Carter, who also advocated withdrawing troops from Korea during his presidential campaign but later changed his mind.    Reflecting on his party's failure to win a majority in the Assembly, Mr. Roh says there were many reasons, but the major one was simply that &quot;the public didn't want the government party to be too strong.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
