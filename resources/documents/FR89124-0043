Since none of thesetobacco growers are expected to approve quotas for the next three marketingyears, a Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis has not been prepared.If growers of any kind of these tobacco should approve quotas, a FinalRegulatory Impact Analysis describing the options considered in developingthe final notice and the impact of implementing each option would be madeavailable on request from Robert Tarczy.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>This notice has been reviewed underUSDA procedures established to implement Executive Order 12291 and DepartmentRegulation 1512-1 and has been classified as ``not major.'' The mattersunder consideration will not result in: (1) An annual effect on the economyof $100 million or more, (2) a major increase in costs for consumers, individualindustries, Federal, State or local governments, or geographical regions,or (3) significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, the environment or the ability of United States-basedenterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or exportmarkets.The title and number of the Federal Assistance Program that this noticeapplies to are: Title_Commodity Loan and Purchases, Number_10.051, as setforth in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.It has been determined that the Regulatory Flexibility Act is not applicableto this notice since the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service(ASCS) is not required by 5 U.S.C. 553 or any provision of law to publisha notice of proposed rulemaking with respect to the subject matter of thisnotice.This activity is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials.See the Notice related to CFR Part 3015, Subpart V, published at 48 FR29115 (June 24, 1983).The Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, as amended (hereinafter referredto as the ``Act''), requires that, with respect to Maryland tobacco, cigar-filler,and cigar-binder tobacco, the Secretary of Agriculture must, by March 1,1989, proclaim marketing quotas for the 1989-90, 1990-91, and 1991-92 marketingyears and determine, announce the amount of the national marketing quotain effect for the 1989-90 marketing year.In addition, the Secretary is required to conduct, within 30 days afterthe proclamation of such national marketing quotas, referenda of farmersengaged in the 1988 production of each such kinds of tobacco in order todetermine whether they favor or oppose marketing quotas for such years.Section 312(a) of the Act (7 U.S.C. 1312(a)) provides that the Secretaryshall, not later than March 1 of any marketing year with respect to thesekinds of tobacco, proclaim a national marketing quota for each of the nextthree succeeding marketing years whenever the Secretary determines withrespect to such kinds of tobacco_(1) That a national marketing quota has not previously been proclaimedand the total supply as of the beginning of such marketing year exceedsthe reserve supply level therefor;(2) That such marketing year is the last year of three consecutive yearsfor which marketing quotas previously proclaimed will be in effect;(3) That amendments have been made in provisions for establishing farmacreage allotments which will cause material revision of such allotmentsbefore the end of the period for which quotas are in effect; or(4) That a marketing quota previously proclaimed for such marketing yearis not in effect because of disapproval by producers in a referendum: <T3>Provided, </T3>That if such producers have disapproved national marketingquotas for three successive years subsequent to 1952, thereafter a nationalmarketing quota shall not be proclaimed in accordance with section 312(a)which would be in effect for any marketing year within the three-year periodfor which national marketing quotas previously proclaimed were disapprovedby producers, unless prior to November 10 of the marketing year one-fourthor more of the farmers engaged in the production of the crop of tobaccoharvested in the calendar year in which such marketing year begins petitionthe Secretary, in accordance with such regulations as may be prescribed,to proclaim a national marketing quota for each of the next three succeedingmarketing years.Producers of Maryland (type 32), cigar-filler (type 41), and cigar-binder(types 51 andamp; 52) tobaccos have disapproved national marketing quotasfor three successive years subsequent to 1952. Quotas for these kinds oftobacco were last proclaimed for the 1986-87, 1987-88, and 1988-89 marketingyears (51 FR 21004, 22958). Producers of Maryland (type 32), cigar-filler(type 41) and cigar-binder (types 51 andamp; 52) tobaccos disapproved marketingquotas in separate referenda held during February 24-27, 1986, (51 FR 16575).Section 312(b) of the Act (7 U.S.C. 1312(b)) provides that the Secretaryshall determine and announce, not later than the first day of March 1989,with respect to the kinds of tobacco specified in this notice of proposeddeterminations, the amount of the national marketing quota which will bein effect for the 1989-91 marketing year in terms of the total quantityof tobacco which may be marketed which will make available during suchmarketing year a supply of each kind of tobacco equal to the reserve supplylevel.
