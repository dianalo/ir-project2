It was the first government response to a series of calls byChinese intellectuals for the release of political prisoners,especially activist Wei Jingsheng, who has been jailed since 1979.   Leading dissident Fang Lizhi first suggested an amnesty lastmonth in an open letter to senior leader Deng Xiaoping. Last week,33 intellectuals, including some of China's most famous writers andthinkers, sent the government and ruling Communist Party a secondletter appealing for an amnesty.   Since then, nearly 50 more people have signed a petitionsupporting the appeal, as have more than 600 Chinese citizens in theUnited States. Thirty-two scholars in Nationalist-ruled Taiwan havesigned a statement of support.   ``We wanted to show our support for this wonderful idea,'' saidHong Zhu in Cambridge, Mass., who signed with her husband, mainlandjournalist Liu Binyan.   Liu, 64, a Nieman Fellow at Harvard University, is the mostfamous of the Chinese who have signed in the United States. He wasfired as a reporter for China's leading newspaper, the People'sDaily, and kicked out of the Communist Party in 1987 because of hiscrusade against government corruption.   ``I know the authorities will not be too happy about this, but Idon't think they can do anything to us,'' Hong said of the petition.She said more than 600 names of signers were published Tuesday inChinese-language newspapers in New York.   The London-based human rights group Amnesty Internationalestimates China has thousands of prisoners of conscience.   Xinhua quoted the Justice Ministry official as saying, ``Noorganization, be it a political party, government, people's congressor any other institution, nor any person has the power to alter acourt verdict.''   He added, ``It is my hope that people will maintain a soberattitude and safeguard China's political environment characterizedby stability, unity, democracy and harmony.''   The official did not say if any action would be taken againstthose who signed the letters and petitions. He mentioned by nameonly one signer, Chen Jun, 30, who studied in the United States andnow runs a private bar. He distributed copies of the letters toreporters last week.   Other signers included Bing Xin, 87, one of pre-revolutionaryChina's most famous woman writers; well-known poet Bei Dao and SuShaozhi, a leading Marxist theorist.   The official noted that while in the United States, Chuncontributed to the magazine China Spring, which China considersreactionary and has banned. The New York-based China Spring is runby Chinese nationals and defectors, and promotes democratic reformin China.   The magazine's editor, Ding Chu, said in an interview it ishelping collect signatures in the United States in support of theproposed amnesty.   Ding, a graduate student at Long Island University who said heplans to return to China, said supporters will be going to NewYork's Chinatown to collect signatures.   ``We are trying to get 20,000,'' he said. There are more than30,000 Chinese studying in the United States, with dozens morescholars visiting to lecture or do research.   The call for a political amnesty comes during one of the mostlively periods of political debate in China in a decade. For severalheady months in 1978-79, the government did not interfere as Chineseput up thousands of protest posters on a Beijing wall that wasdubbed Democracy Wall and small unofficial magazines were circulatedcalling for democracy.   But in the spring of 1979, officials began arresting DemocracyWall participants, including one of the leaders, Wei Jingsheng. Weiremains in jail and is rumored to have gone insane.</TEXT></DOC>
