The United States is expected to alter the militaryequilibrium of this prosperous society. Removing intermediate-range nuclearforces (INF) should trigger a chain of events that would speed up theEuropeanization of Europe. Germany and France would establish a bilateralmilitary force within NATO, and France would then forward deploy twoadditional divisions and nuclear weapons onto German soil.
