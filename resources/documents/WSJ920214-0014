Part of the problem, however, is that there never was asingle economic space in the old Soviet Union. Because it wasa totalitarian communist system, there was never even anapproximation of free movement of goods and people. Flows ofgoods were ultimately controlled by state planners in Moscow,not by supply and demand. Movement of people was regulated byan internal passport system and state and party control overthe supply of housing.</LP><TEXT>   Until there is genuine privatization, commercial dealingswithin the Former Soviet Union (FSU) will be largely on astate-to-state basis, which already is causing sparks to fly.   Ukraine, for example, not long ago demanded an eightfoldincrease in the ruble price for the coal it ships to Russiaand Russia threatened to retaliate with a similar boost inthe price of the oil it sends to Ukraine. Since there isstill nothing approaching market pricing and since the rubleitself has become an unreliable unit of account, the only wayfor these two republics to resolve their differences overprices is through confrontation. Since Ukrainians havedeep-seated memories of the horrors they suffered during 70years of Russian-dominated communism, the potential foreconomic warfare is high.   Clearly, the best thing that could happen to defuse thesestate-to-state frictions would be wholesale privatization.Whereas the republican governments are increasingly likely tosee trade agreements as a test of muscle and will, privateenterprises will see them as a way to make money. Those thatmake money will want to hire more workers, which means thatthey will have to make their own efforts to lower barriers tolabor mobility, by encouraging housing construction, forexample.   As to the question of a common currency, it will presentmany of the same issues that face the European Community inits quest for a common currency. Unless Russia can come upsoon with a plausible plan for establishing a hard,convertible ruble that the peoples of all the republics willbe eager to accept, the republics will be inclined toestablish their own currencies. Ukraine already is moving inthat direction. The issue of monetary sovereignty will becomejust as big a barrier in the FSU as it is for the Europeans.   So while there is economic logic in the idea of a singleeconomic space, the FSU is still subject to powerfulcentrifugal forces pulling its members toward otherarrangements. For Ukraine and the Baltic States, theexperience with Moscow center has been too bitter to inclinethem toward new bonds of commerce and friendship.   The motto is &quot;never again.&quot; Twelve of the states,excluding the Baltics, have been willing to form aCommonwealth of Independent States, but it is a commonwealthwith the loosest possible ties, more of convenience formaking dispositions of old relationships than a vehicle forknitting together a new confederation.   Despite all these problems, Mr. Mashits has managed topersuade Kazakhstan and Belarus to join in the economic zone.Maybe diplomacy will bring along Ukraine. For the sake ofgeneral economic recovery it can be hoped that he makesprogress. But no one should be overly surprised if thisproves to be a far more difficult task than it now looks.</TEXT></DOC>
