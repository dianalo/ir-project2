The bank has about 10,000 employees.    The move is seen as part of an aggressive strategy by Robert H. Smith, who took over in April as president and chief executive officer, to boost profits and efficiency. In addition to job cuts, to be accomplished partly through attrition and retirement incentives, Security Pacific said it would institute a performance-based pay incentive program for a range of employees.    Under the plan, Security Pacific also said it will greatly expand its automatic teller network, institute flexible hours at some branches, simplify banking services and add sales personnel to generate loans in non-traditional banking areas. Mr. Smith said earlier that the bank may also consolidate 3% to 4% of its 600 branches, which serve three million customers in California.    The bank is the main subsidiary of Security Pacific Corp., with assets of $64 billion. Its California branch network is second in size only to San Francisco-based BankAmerica Corp. </TEXT></DOC>
