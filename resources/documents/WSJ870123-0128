The plan was opposed by Newport's largest holder, David F. LaRoche, a Providence, R.I., businessman who sought control of Newport with a hostile tender offer in his effort to defeat the plan. As previously reported, Mr. LaRoche asserted that the plan would entrench Newport's management and hinder changes that could increase its market value. Mr. LaRoche couldn't be reached for comment.    Mr. LaRoche holds about 30% of Newport's approximately 960,000 common shares, including a stake of about 18% that he acquired in his tender offer, which expired last week. However, he wasn't able to vote all of his shares in the reorganization plan vote because some shares tendered to him had been purchased by the tendering owners after Oct. 2, the vote's record date, a Newport spokesman said.    The reorganization makes the utility a unit of a holding company, which Newport said will facilitate future nonregulated ventures. </TEXT></DOC>
