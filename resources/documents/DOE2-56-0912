Themodel also suggests that ozone variations of solar and anthropogenicorigins between 1979 and 1986 were of similar magnitude but that theozone response to trace gas emissions increases substantially with latitudewhile the solar signal in ozone is present lower in the atmosphere andis nearly independent of latitude. copyright American Geophysical Union1988</TEXT></DOC>
