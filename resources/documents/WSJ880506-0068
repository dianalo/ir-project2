The American Pacific Corp. plant, which was destroyed in a series of explosions Wednesday, produced nearly half the nation's store of ammonium perchlorate, a crucial ingredient in solid-rocket boosters. A plant owned by Kerr-McGee Corp., already operating at full capacity, accounts for the remainder of the U.S. supply of the chemical. The two plants are located one and one-half miles apart in Henderson, Nev.    Royce Mitchell, manager of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's solid-rocket motor project office in Huntsville, Ala., said that NASA has enough ammonium perchlorate for four shuttle launches. NASA plans to start launching the shuttle again in August, and to complete its fourth launch in March 1989. &quot;There could be a pinch point coming in a year, or a year and a-half,&quot; Mr. Mitchell said.    The Air Force has sufficient rocket fuel for about a year, but the Pentagon worries about fuel shortages after that, according to an Air Force spokesman. The Air Force uses solid-rocket boosters for its MX and Titan missiles.    The explosion also has defense contractors worried that they won't be able to deliver some of the military's most important strategic and tactical weapons. A spokesman for GenCorp's Aerojet-General unit, which makes rocket motors for the MX and Minuteman nuclear missiles and the Navy's Hawk and Harpoon missiles, said: &quot;We have enough stock on hand to meet our program needs for the next couple of months, but beyond that I can't say.&quot;    Hawk and Harpoon missiles use solid rocket fuel. The Navy relied heavily on the Harpoon during recent fighting with Iranian forces in the Persian Gulf.    NASA's Mr. Mitchell said that once the shuttle begins regular launches, NASA and the Air Force would need about 65 million pounds of the rocket-chemical a year -- roughly the total output from both plants. The Navy also has increasing demand for the chemical.    However, in Henderson, a Kerr-McGee engineer said that the company's ammonium perchlorate plant was already producing at full capacity, and couldn't easily increase production. A Kerr-McGee spokeswoman in Oklahoma City said the company is reviewing whether it can expand its capability.    American Pacific, in a statement, said that with &quot;the full cooperation of customers and agencies of the U.S. government&quot; it could rebuild its plant in six months, &quot;although there could be no assurance thereof.&quot; The statement didn't specify whether the company would ask the government for money to rebuild the plant, which it said was insured for about $29 million.    David Winterhalter, a senior NASA shuttle manager, said in the early 1980s NASA had invested funds in the American Pacific plant to increase its capacity. He said it was too early to tell whether the agency would get involved again.    The American Pacific plant was operated by an American Pacific subsidiary, Pacific Engineering andamp; Production Co. of Nevada. American Pacific said a team of insurance investigators is expected to try to determine what caused the accident. The company said that its manufacturing process and its product weren't to blame.    The Kerr-McGee plant was built in 1952 as part of a Navy contract. Some years later, a Kerr-McGee spokeswoman said, some Kerr-McGee employees left to build the rival plant. Both plants were built outside Las Vegas because of the availability there of cheap hydroelectric power and because Nevada's dry climate makes chemical storage easier. </TEXT></DOC>
