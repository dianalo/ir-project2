The 24-hour national rail strike by the National Union ofRailwaymen was its fourth Wednesday stoppage in as many weeks. Andthe daylong strike by London subway drivers is their 10th sinceApril 5.   This has been the worst week of labor unrest since Prime MinisterMargaret Thatcher came to power 10 years ago, and polls show thepopularity of her governing Conservative party sinking.   On Monday and Tuesday, rail services were badly disrupted by aban on overtime by train drivers belonging to another union, theAssociated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen.   Today's rail strike followed the breakdown Tuesday night of 12hours of talks between British Rail managers and rail unions whenunion representatives walked out.   Union leaders said the board that runs the state-owned railnetwork had upped its wage increase offer to 8.8 percent from 7percent. The union is demanding 10 percent.   Jimmy Knapp, general secretary of the National Union ofRailwaymen, accused British Rail of being a `cheapskate.''   Railmen also want British Rail to cancel its decision to endnational pay bargaining on Oct. 31 and replace it with regionalnegotiations. That issue was also not resolved in thelabor-management talks.   Mrs. Thatcher told Parliament Tuesday: ``Once again it is some ofthe extreme left wing in the trade unions who never think of servingthe public or of their duty to the public.''   A survey of public opinion polls Tuesday by the BritishBroadcasting Corp. indicated Mrs. Thatcher's Conservatives are nowtrailing Neil Kinnock's opposition Labor Party in popularity by a10-point margin.   Britain's rising annual inflation rate, now at 8.3 percent, itshighest in seven years, has eaten into wages, leading to pay demandsand unpopularity for the government.   A National Opinion Polls survey among 2,770 rail passengerspublished today in the Conservative London newspaper the Daily Mailsaid 33 percent blamed poor British Rail management for the strikesand other disruption. Twenty-three percent blamed the rail unionsand 20 percent blamed the government.   The Transport and General Workers Union, meanwhile, said 96percent of its 9,400 registered dock workers stayed off the jobMonday, the first day of their indefinite strike.   The strikers are protesting the government's abolition of 1947legislation that replaced daily hiring at 60 ports with guaranteedjobs for dock workers. They voted 3-to-1 to strike after portemployers refused to replace the so-called National Labor DockScheme with private guarantees.   The National Association of Port Employers said 42 of the 60powers were hit by the strike. It said the other 18 plus the 102non-scheme ports were working normally.   A 48-hour pay strike by members of the National And LocalGovernment Officers' Association employed by local councils enteredits second day today. It is the second stoppage called by the unionin two weeks.   It has shut down local government services ranging from librariesand day care centers for the handicapped to garbage collection andlocal tax offices. The union said nearly half a million members areon strike.</TEXT></DOC>
