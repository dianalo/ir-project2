The monitoring signals are fetal heart rate (FHR) and uterinecontraction (UC) through the conventional monitoring device for a dayuntil the delivery. These signals are fed to a micro-computer in digitalformat, and evaluated by the computer in real time according to the diagnosticalgorithm of the expert physician. Monitoring signals are always displayedon the CRT screen and in the case of dangerous state of the fetus, warningsignal will appear on the screen and the doctor or nurse will be called.All these signals are sent to the next micro-computer with 10MB harddisk system. On this computer, the doctor and nurse can retrieve andinspect the details of the process by clock-key and/or events-key. Afterfinishing monitoring process, summarized report is constructed and printedout on the paper.</TEXT></DOC>
