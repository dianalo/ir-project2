But some industry analysts say the lower prices may have hurtthe traditional last-minute buying spree.   ``I think that we're seeing a moderate increase in retailmomentum in the last week,'' Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. Inc. analystWalter Loeb said Thursday. Sales of coats, sweaters and other warmclothing have been better than expected because of bitterly coldweather around the country, he said.   However, Loeb said, ``some of the excitement of the last-minuteshopping was undermined.''   As the days tick down toward Christmas, retailers are countingon down-to-the-wire buyers to boost business and bolster profits atthis crucial time of year.   Several store executives said Thursday said they noticed apickup in sales heading into a final weekend that could decide ifthis is a ho-hum or ho-ho-ho holiday season.   Bargain hunters have been enjoying a jolly time sinceThanksgiving, finding plenty of prices marked down _ particularlyat department stores owned by cash-starved Campeau Corp. and theircompetitors.   In the dog-eat-dog New York market, Campeau-owned Bloomingdale'sas well as rivals Macy's and Lord andamp; Taylor have been advertisingprice cuts of 20 percent or more on dresses, sweaters and otherapparel. Bloomingdale's, which is being sold by Campeau, is underextra pressure to pump up sales so that it will fetch the bestpossible bid.   The price competition isn't as fierce in all metropolitan areasas it is in New York but analysts say that this year generally hasbeen more promotional than normal.   Retailers offering enhanced services, such as personal shoppersand pre-wrapped presents, say the effort is paying off. Manyretailers are pleased with their results so far.   John Buller, senior vice president of marketing at The BonMarche, said the Seattle-based department store chain, owned byCampeau, is having one of its best years ever.   Sales at The Bon Marche's 43 stores mostly in the PacificNorthwest have been running in the ``high single digits'' abovelast year, spurred by numerous merchandising ideas, Buller said.Every floor of each store has displays of gifts wrapped and readyto be put under Christmas trees.   Luxury gifts and accommodating service have pulled in customers.Kenneth Watson, chairman and chief executive officer of Gump's,said that in addition to providing personal shoppers _ staff whoact as elves for customers _ Gump's is offering free delivery inthe San Francisco Bay area and direct telephone lines to make iteasier for shoppers to place orders.   Watson said holiday business at the upscale specialty chain isabout 12 percent ahead of year ago. ``I would say in our case it'smuch better than expected or anticipated,'' he said.   Crystal, watches, pens, travelers' clocks and leather bags havebeen fast sellers at the tony Cartier jewelry stores, said ThierryChaunu, vice president of marketing.   In addition to discounted apparel and accessories, moderatelypriced home furnishings appear to be selling well, store executivesand analysts said.   Clark A. Johnson, chairman and chief executive officer of Pier IImports Inc., a specialty furnishings chain of 511 stores, saidChristmas sales are running about 20 percent above 1988. Thestrongest regions have been Florida, northern California and thePacific Northwest, while Texas and the Boston area have been theweakest.   Spending on consumer electronics seems to have held up despiteoverall sluggish sales of expensive durable merchandise, such ashome appliances.   The 90-plus franchisees of Software City have reported ``prettybrisk'' business since Thanksgiving, president Shep Altshuler said.   Maria Cirino, marketing vice president for the New Jersey-baseddiscounter, said sophisticated computer systems previouslyassociated with businesses are being bought for home use.   Programs that help people organize budgets or tax informationand educate children are hot sellers, she said. Broder Bund'ssoftware including ``Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego'' or``Where in Time is Carmen Sandiego,'' intended to teach geographyand history, are two sought-after programs.   Many retailers were reluctant to assess their performanceknowing that the next few days could be crucial. A late rally lastyear salvaged the holiday season, which typically accounts for halfor more of a retailer's annual profits.   ``The question is: `What happened this week?''' said RosalindWells, chief economist of the National Retail Merchants Association.   Even if it meets retailers' most optimistic dreams, there willbe stores stuck with slow-moving merchandise that will have toslash prices to unload seasonal goods.   Said Loeb of Morgan Stanley: ``There will be heavy clearancemarkdowns. You've got to get rid of seasonal merchandise.''</TEXT></DOC>
