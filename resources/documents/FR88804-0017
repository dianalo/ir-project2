Lloyd, ExecutiveSecretary, DAR Council, (202) 697-7266.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</T2><ITAG tagnum="84">A. Background</ITAG>The Department of Defense has historically imposed MIL-STD 1567A on a program-by-programbasis. This standard, when required, contains criteria by which a contractorwould either be able to maintain its existing work measurement system,if acceptable, or would be required to develop an acceptable work measurementsystem. This proposed revision will implement DoD's policy to use WMS inall appropriate contracts, using MIL-STD 1567A or other appropriate criterialtailored for each specific contract or program.<ITAG tagnum="84">B. Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>The proposed rule is not expected to have significant economic impact ona substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the RegulatoryFlexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>, because work measurement systems are only required onmajor weapon systems and subsystems production contracts in excess of $20million annually or a total cost of $100 million, and full scale developmentcontracts in excess of $100 million. An Initial Regulatory FlexibilityAnalysis has therefore not been performed. Comments are invited from smallbusinesses and other interested parties. Comments from small entities concerningthe affected DFARS Subpart will also be considered in accordance with section610 of the Act. Such comments must be submitted separately and cite DFARSCASE 88-610D in correspondence.<ITAG tagnum="84">C. Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>The rule does not contain information collection requirements which requirethe approval of OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3501.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 48 CFR Part 215</ITAG>Government procurement.<ITAG tagnum="6">Charles W. Lloyd,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Executive Secretary, Defense Acquisition Regulatory Council.</ITAG>Therefore, it is proposed to amend 48 CFR Part 215 as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 215_CONTRACTING BY NEGOTIATION</ITAG>1. The authority citation for 48 CFR Part 215 continues to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>5 U.S.C. 301, 10 U.S.C. 2202, DoD Directive 5000.35,and DoD FAR Supplement 201.301.</ITAG>2. Section 215.807 is amended by adding to the end of paragraph (b) thefollowing text:<ITAG tagnum="80">215.807</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Prenegotiation objectives.</ITAG>(b) * * * Data resulting from the application of work measurement systemsshall be considered in the development of pricing objectives and negotiations.3. Section 215.876 is added to subpart 215.8 to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="80">215.876</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Work measurement systems.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Definition. </T3>``Work measurement systems (WMS),'' as used in thissection, are systems used to analyze the direct labor content of a manufacturingoperation, establish standard labor performance factors for that operation,and measure variances from those standards.(b) <T3>Policy. </T3>The policy of the Department of Defense is that WMS willbe used to provide data for use in planning, cost estimating, and monitoringcontract performance, on all appropriate contracts and will be tailoredto be suitable for the program and contract. An example of an acceptableset of criteria for WMS is found in MIL-STD-1567A. The contracting officer,in coordination with the Program Manager, shall include provisions in thecontract to implement the program's work measurement system requirements.(c) <T3>Applicability. </T3>Solicitations and resulting production contractsin excess of $20 million annually or a total cost of $100 million for majorweapons systems or subsystems should contain appropriately tailored provisionsfor WMS. WMS requirements may also be included in Full Scale Development(FSD) contracts exceeding $100 million. Work measurement systems shouldnot be required on contracts which:(1) Procure Non-Developmental Items (NDIs);(2) Have low volume, non-repetitive production runs such as ship construction,ship system contracts, etc.;(3) Do not require the submission and certification of cost or pricingdata; or(4) Will not gain a cost benefit from the imposition of these systems.This decision will be documented and approved in accordance with agencyprocedures.<ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 88-17651 Filed 8-3-88; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 3810-01-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
