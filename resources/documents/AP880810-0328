Commerce Secretary C. William Verity said President Reagandirected the Commerce and Defense departments to assess recentefforts to improve the competitiveness of the ball bearing industrybefore a decision is made on import restrictions.   In July 1987, the Anti-Friction Bearing ManufacturersAssociation filed a petition seeking protection under a 1962 lawdesigned to protect industries vital to national defense.   ``The petition alleged that high levels of imports are seriouslyweakening the domestic bearing industry's defense productioncapabilities,'' Verity said in a statement.   ``The administration ... is currently taking a number of stepsto better enable the domestic bearing industry to improve itsproduction capabilities,'' he said.   Among the steps are new regulations requiring defensecontractors to use only U.S.-manufactured ball bearings and aprogram to encourage the industry to modernize.   ``Because the administration's actions are expected to improvethe bearing industry's ability to meet national securityrequirements, the president is withholding a final decision ... atthis time,'' Verity said.</TEXT></DOC>
