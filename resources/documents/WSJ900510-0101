Back in 1979, Mr. Rowny put a damper on SALT II when hequit his job as lead delegate to the talks with LeonidBrezhnev. Then, Congress heeded an old general's message andrefused to ratify a strategic treaty that ceded importantarms advantages to the Soviet Union. Now, Mr. Rowny isresigning again -- this time from his job as senior armscontrol adviser to the president. Again, he's worried about astrategic treaty that can put the U.S. in a scary position.This round, Mr. Rowny's challenge is more daunting. InWashington today, it's hard to find anyone besides Baltsworried about Soviet aggression.</LP><TEXT>   The Bush-Gorbachev summit planned for the end of thismonth is what troubles Mr. Rowny. U.S. and Soviet negotiatorsare racing to prepare the framework for a treaty on limitingstrategic missiles, START. Secretary of State Baker is off toMoscow on Monday to work on the effort. It's an agreement,Mr. Rowny says, that is loaded against the United States.We're agreeing to missile cuts with the Soviet Union, butwhile we're doing so, the Soviet Union is modernizing itsmissiles so they're more powerful than a START agreementwould reflect.   Mr. Rowny thinks a lot, for example, about SS-18s,intercontinental missiles three times as heavy as anythingthe U.S. has. The Soviet Union has land-based mobilemissiles, while America's, after years, are still on thedrawing board. He's afraid, in particular, that the U.S. willput off the thornier problem of verification, and focus onthe glory of getting START moving now. On verification, hepoints to some disturbing news. After the U.S. completed theINF treaty with the Soviet Union in 1987, it assumed allintermediate-range nuclear missiles were gone from EastEurope. But since then, intermediate-range SS-23s have beendiscovered in East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria.   Why, in the year of the peace dividend, should we careabout Cold War terms like &quot;threat&quot; and &quot;verification&quot; anyway?Because START, at least the START that early models show,gives a weakening country a strong military advantage.Because a rocky Soviet Union -- one with tanks in Riga andVilnius, and an eye on rebellion bubbling in Tallinn -- couldbe a less predictable opponent than the ossified Soviet Unionof the slow-moving Brezhnev. Mr. Rowny summed this up in atalk he gave the other day: &quot;It would be a tragic mistake toimpose a false clarity on the future by assuming that apolitical status quo exists at present.&quot;   The right way to proceed with disarmament, in the Rownyview, is to &quot;push like the devil on conventional forcesnegotiations,&quot; first. On conventionals, Moscow has alreadyagreed to asymmetrical cuts -- cuts that mean, for example,that the Soviets will no longer be able to station their 17divisions in East Germany. A more even playing field onconventionals means the U.S. would be even less likely toresort to nuclear weapons -- for example, the short-rangetactical missiles Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney is talkingabout this week at a NATO meeting in Calgary.   Mr. Rowny's logic on getting a strong conventionalagreement is old but sound. He says the fact the Soviet Unionis making treaties with East Bloc countries to move off theirterritory is no guarantee Europe will be safe from invasion.&quot;Because even if the Soviets withdraw from those countries,they don't have a long distance to travel when they comeback.&quot;   Mr. Rowny himself doesn't like to compare this season'sresignation to his SALT departure. But some of the parallelsare worth noting. Verification, then as now, was for him akey concern. Then, testifying before the Senate on SALT II,he called the treaty &quot;detrimental to our national security,&quot;and said that &quot;In our zeal to reach an agreement the UnitedStates made too many concessions. We permitted largeinequalities favoring the Soviet Union to be written into theagreement.&quot; The same words represent his stand today.   The main difference is the audience he is addressing.Then, Mr. Rowny went to work -- at $143 a day -- as aconsultant testifying against a treaty he succeeded inhelping to block. Now, he'll move to the role of visitingprofessor at George Washington University -- around thecorner from his old office at the State Department.   Ed Rowny is 73, and he calls his resignation simpleretirement. Washington insiders say the arms negotiator hasbecome superfluous anyway. They say Secretary of State JamesBaker, and the White House, don't include him in theirplanmaking. While staffers work furiously to frame some kindof START model for the June summit, Mr. Rowny heads off to ahospital in Arlington for a hip replacement operation.   But this old adviser still feels his voice will be heardin the White House. &quot;I'm with the president and Cheney 100%on policy,&quot; he says during a meeting in his State Departmentoffice, and pushes his black glasses up his nose. He'd likehis musings to be heard now -- after a summit that fixes aSTART plan, he argues, it will be &quot;too late&quot; to warn against.   &quot;Arcane&quot; is the term most folk in this town would use todescribe the Rowny view -- and, in fact, the entiredisarmament process. The principal thing, they argue, is tomake deals that will help Mikhail Gorbachev. Mr. Rowny has adifferent perspective, one perhaps born of commanding a WorldWar II regiment in Africa, helping to plan the invasion atInchon and 3,000 hours at the international negotiatingtable. &quot;The Soviets were there before Gorbachev,&quot; says thisuneasy Cassandra. &quot;And they'll be there after him.&quot;   ---   Miss Shlaes is deputy editorial features editor of TheWall Street Journal.</TEXT></DOC>
