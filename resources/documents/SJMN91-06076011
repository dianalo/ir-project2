<DOC><DOCNO> SJMN91-06076011 </DOCNO><ACCESS> 06076011 </ACCESS><LEADPARA>  I TEACH a writing class three days a week in the journalism department at SanJose State. The class starts at 8:30 a.m., right when the clock on theclassroom wall says 5:33.;    Although the clock is baldly wrong, itnevertheless proclaims its misinformation with a conscienceless certitude. Ilike to think this reminds the clock-watchers in the class (which, I fear,includes all of us, even me) that the business of information, includingwriting, teeters one false step from misinformation.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Local  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  CRAZY CLOCKS OF ACADEMIA  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     As a result, we try in our class work to stay mindful of accuracy andclarity.;    A dissembling clock may be a sparse metaphor, but these days it'sapt enough. After all, our vision in academia is illuminated by the leaders ofour universities.;    And have you heard their version lately of the time ofday?;    For some reason, I'm not as shocked by a sleazy savings and loanofficer explaining how he ravaged the life savings of widows as I am byStanford's decorous president telling a congressional hearing, &quot;There is noevidence brought out that we did nothing other than to follow governmentlaw.&quot;;    Once I've waded through Donald Kennedy's negatives in that sentence,I find this: Even if we violated the spirit of the law, we didn't break theletter of it -- and anyway, nobody can prove anything.;     I GUESS I'm naive.I had expected something more forthright from the president of perhaps thegreatest university in the country. But then, that's the sort of mud he mustplow through when he explains how taxpayers have borne the costs of hisbedclothes and laundry.;    My students at State, unaccustomed to the poshappointments of a place like Stanford, nevertheless have a strikingly similarexample from the pinnacle of their university.;    Maybe you heard news thisweek about a state audit that said California State University trustees metillegally more than 60 times over the past three years, and that the systemspent almost half a million dollars to keep up the home in Bel Air ofthen-Chancellor W. Ann Reynolds.;    In dollars, the stuff about CSU doesn'tapproach the bills Stanford issued to the government for a long list of frillycosts it claims were related to government-funded research. Stanford has beenaccused of overcharging the government up to $180 million.;     BUT THE TIMINGof the CSU audit compounds months of fearsome rumors about anticipatedcutbacks and tuition increases in the CSU system. It seems as if every weekthere's a memo in my SJS mailbox probing new depths of bleakness as itanticipates the impending cuts.;    And if you're a student at State, maybeliving at home, working a job while trying to keep up with studies, you'refaced with a 20 percent rise in tuition.;    Some of my students have talkedto me about it, and I can see the worry in their faces. &quot;I'm afraid,&quot; onefrankly told me.;    I'm not sure whether it's cynical or just realistic toexpect powerful people to use their positions for self-aggrandizement andself-indulgence.;    But until recently, I hadn't extended that axiom topowerful people in academia. I'd always felt that the people drawn to thatlife willingly sacrificed certain comforts for more abstract rewards. That'sthe reason I thought &quot;higher education&quot; referred to more than a number higherthan grade 12.;    On the last day of my writing class this semester, maybeI'll do something dramatic. Maybe I'll scale a desk to fix the lying clock,turn around and repeat the mantra one last time about accuracy and clarity,and then pronounce them all writers.;    I hope you learned something in thisclass, I'll tell them.;    I already know what they've learned outside it.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Larry Slonaker column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910316  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  623  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday March 16, 199100076011,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
