The rules specify the parcrude as West Texas Intermediate (WTI) with a 40anddegrees; gravity (API)and 0.4 percent sulfur. There is a 2-cent per barrel discount for eachfull degree of gravity (API) below 40anddegrees; and a 5-cent per barrelpremium (discount) for each full 0.1 percent sulfur content less (more)than 0.4 percent. To be eligible for delivery, crude oil must have a gravityof 34anddegrees; to 45anddegrees; (A.P.I.) and a sulphur content that doesnot exceed 0.5 percent by weight.Delivery on the crude oil futures contract takes place ``no earlier thanthe first calendar day of the delivery month and no later than the lastcalendar day of the delivery month,'' based on pipeline scheduling. Longsaccepting delivery fill out a ``Notice of Intention to Accept Delivery''specifying their intentions and requests.The proposed amendments would eliminate four currently deliverable foreigncrudes (Nigerian Brass Blend, Norwegian Ekofisk, Tunisian Zarzaitine/ElBorma and Algerian Saharan Blend) and add one new foreign crude (NorwegianOseberg Blend). With these amendments, only three foreign crudes wouldbe deliverable_U.K. Brent Blend, Nigerian Bonny Light and Norwegian OsebergBlend.The proposed amendments also would eliminate the existing price adjustmentsfor sulfur and gravity noted above, so that all eligible domestic and foreigncrudes meeting the NYMEX's gravity and sulfur standards would be deliverableat par. In addition, the proposal would make explicit the seller's obligationto ensure that crude oil is available to begin flowing in Cushing, Oklahoma(the delivery point) by the first day of the delivery month.The Exchange also has proposed a resolution on matching whereby the Exchangewill provide long participants with the option of requesting delivery offoreign crude oil, which will be allocated to such longs if it is deliveredagainst crude oil futures by short participants. The resolution also specifiesprocedures for distributing any foreign crude oil to long participantsif the total requests for foreign crudes do not equal the amount to bedelivered by the shorts.In support of the proposed changes regarding the deliverable foreign crudes,the NYMEX stated that ``the key issue is one of product fungibility.''The Exchange noted that, in the 1980's:. . . Saharan Blend and Brass River foreign crudes have tended to tradeat a discount to WTI. They have tended to trade at a discount, not onlybecause they are not more available, but also because they produce significantlyless gasoline that that of WTI (and the demand for gasoline has risen).Moreover, even though Zarzaitine is technically not an OPEC crude oil .. . the same problem of increased supply and lower yield patterns affectits pricing relative to WTI.. . . The second factor altering product fungibility concerns changes forgasoline's Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP). RVP is a measure of gasoline's volatility.In early 1989 both the federal and a number of state governments beganmandating lower gasoline volatility during summer months as a way of reducingair pollution. When the governments mandated lower RVP standards, it changedrelative crude oils values because crude oils have different proportionsof ``light ends''.Those crude oils with larger amounts of condensate or butane, for example,will yield less environmentally acceptable gasoline than crude oils withless light ends. . . . Ekofisk, Saharan Blend, and Zarzaitine have significantlyhigher light end components than WTI. As a result, these crude oils havebecome much less valuable relative to WTI.After considering both the trading relationship of the above crude oils(i.e., the supply and demand for these crude oils relative to WTI), andthe effect of the RVP changes, the Exchange's Crude Oil Advisory Committeevoted to remove Saharan Blend, Zarzaitine, Brass River, and Ekofisk crudeoils from the list of deliverable crude oils. None of these crude oilswere considered close enough to WTI to allow them to be delivered as asubstitute. Brent Blend and Bonny Light were, however, considered closeenough to remain deliverable.Regarding the addition of Oseberg Blend, the Exchange stated that ``thisdecision represents a compromise between the various market participants.It also represents a decision accepted by the majority or refiners in Oklahomaand Kansas.'' The Exchange further noted that an additional reason foradding Oseberg Blend was that its production is expected to increase to340,000 barrels per day (bd) by 1992. NYMEX stated that ``total productionshould increase to approximately 600,000 bd by the mid 1990s.'' With respect to the proposed elimination of the gravity and sulfur adjustment,the NYMEX justified this proposal in two ways, as noted below. First, the industry has gradually phased out gravity and sulfur banks.Most all crude oil pipeline common streams are now operated without suchadjustments. The best example of this probably is the Capline. * * * Second,the Cushing market, and the market the New York Mercantile Exchange hascome to serve and reflect, is primarily a spot market. And the cash WTImarket trades ``flat and gravity.'' All purchases and sales are assumedto be at par and there are no gravity or sulfur adjustments. While thelease, or posted market, still uses such adjustments, they are definitelynot part of the spot market. As a consequence of these changes in the cash market, the provisions forsulfur and gravity adjustment in the crude oil contract are no longer relevant.The Exchange indicated that the intent of the proposed rule change regardingthe seller's obligation to ensure that crude oil is available by the firstof the delivery month is ``to provide the delivery recipient with the sameability to schedule the receipt of foreign barrels as is now availablewhen scheduling [shipment of] domestic barrels.'' The Exchange stated thatthe language of this rule currently focuses on the timing of receipt ofoil into Cushing rather than delivery out. Thus, the Exchange states thatthe revised language meets the needs of longs, while at the same time ensuringthat shorts delivery foreign crude oil in a equivalent manner to that nowoccurring in the domestic cash market. Regarding the proposed revised matching procedures, the NYMEX noted thatthe modification would provide buyers with the option of requesting foreigncrude oil. The NYMEX noted that: A box for indicating this preference will be placed on the ``Intentionto Accept Delivery'' form. (Clearing procedures for such a request willbe handled in a similar manner to that occurring in the New York Harborgasoline or heating oil contracts when a party requests truck delivery.Truck delivery requests are removed from the computer run before they arematched by size, and they are assigned appropriate partners based on theirmutual desire to make or take such a delivery.) There is no guarantee thatsuch requests can or will be fulfilled. It should be noted that the Exchange has been told by a number of traditionallongs that they would avail themselves of this foreign crude oil requestoption. Consequently, such a procedure would greatly aid in the adjustmentof the contract to the evolving cash market practices. The Commission is requesting comment on the merits of NYMEX's proposedchanges to its crude oil futures contract. Also, the Commission is requestingcomment on the proposal to apply the changes to certain existing contractsas explained above. Copies of the proposed amendments will be available for inspection at theOffice of the Secretariat, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, 2033 KStreet, NW., Washington, DC 20581. Copies of the amended terms and conditionscan be obtained through the Office of the Secretariat by mail at the aboveaddress or by telephone at (202) 254-6314. The materials submitted by the NYMEX in support of the proposed amendmentsmay be available upon request pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act(5 U.S.C. 552) and the Commission's regulations thereunder (17 CFR part145 (1987)). Requests for copies of such materials should be made to theFOI, Privacy and Sunshine Act Compliance Staff of the Office of the Secretariatat the Commission's headquarters in accordance with CFR 145.7 and 145.8.Any person interested in submitting written data, views or arguments onthe proposed amendments should send such comments to Jean A. Webb, Secretary,Commodity Futures Trading Commission, 2033 K Street, NW., Washington, DC20581 by the specified date.<ITAG tagnum="21">Issued in Washington, DC on November 24, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Steven Manaster, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Director.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-27954 Filed 11-28-89; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6351-01-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
