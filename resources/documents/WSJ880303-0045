The new party, the Social and Liberal Democrats, will face its first electoral test in local-government elections in May. Its prospects are clouded by the public squabbles surrounding the merger and the decision by former Social Democratic leader David Owen to continue leading a separate faction. In addition, the ruling Conservative and opposition Labor parties have recovered much of the support that had swung to the Liberals and Social Democrats, or SDP.    The Liberals and the SDP have had a loose electoral association, known as the Alliance, since shortly after the SDP's creation in 1981. Efforts to merge the two parties began after the Alliance's poor showing in last June's general election, when it won just 22 of 650 parliamentary seats.    The merger plans prompted the resignation of Dr. Owen, an SDP founder and member of Parliament, who says he will continue leading his SDP faction, which includes two other MPs. He insists that &quot;social democracy&quot; must remain a distinct alternative for voters. The split well could thwart the new party by dividing the centrist vote and deflecting attention from the merger.    Meanwhile, a compilation of recent opinion polls shows that 45.2% of the voters surveyed support the Conservatives, compared with 38.1% for Labor and just 14.8% for the various Liberal and SDP groups. That's far below the 23% of voters who backed the Alliance last June and the 40% support it had in opinion polls as recently as 1985. </TEXT></DOC>
