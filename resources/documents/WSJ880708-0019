Many of them are immigrants from Mexico, Spain and France, who have been on strike since mid-April, and whose protest has disrupted gambling at jai-alai arenas, called frontons, in Connecticut, Rhode Island and Florida.    Jai-alai is similar to raquetball. Players use wicker baskets called cestas, which are strapped to their arms to catch and throw balls at speeds exceeding 150 to 200 miles an hour. Jai-alai is particularly popular because it's a parimutuel sport in which fans can legally bet on players in games just as fans bet on horses at a race track. The length of jai-alai seasons vary from six months to a year.    Nearly all of the players walked out April 14 after forming a union that fronton owners refused to recognize. The union charged owners with &quot;unfair labor practices,&quot; including the requirement that players sign contracts with no-strike clauses. More recently, the strikers affiliated with the UAW to get organizing help. About 90% of the nation's 500 jai-alai players are in the players' union.    States that permit gambling on jai-alai report a measurable economic impact. Connecticut, with three frontons, lost more than $3 million in revenue when the strike cut short its jai-alai season. The city of Bridgeport figures closing the fronton cost the city more than $300,000 in lost revenue &quot;at a time when we're experiencing the worst financial crisis in years,&quot; says Mayor Thomas W. Bucci, who offered unsuccessfully to help mediate the dispute.    Most Florida fronton owners report attendance and handle, or the amount wagered, off 25% to 50%. At the Miami fronton, the average weekly summer attendance was 27,000 with a handle of about $2.8 million. Since the strike, attendance has dropped to 16,000 and bets are down to $1.8 million.    A swift resolution doesn't seem likely, and the National Labor Relations Board is reviewing unfair-labor-practice charges filed by the players. &quot;We'll strike as long as it takes,&quot; says Bob Rasmussen, treasurer of the players' union, the International Jai Alai Players Association.    &quot;We have our rights too,&quot; says a Bridgeport Jai Alai spokesman, who adds that the players association walked out before the labor-relations board held a hearing. &quot;We have a right to replace them.&quot; Owners have hired replacement players in several frontons to maintain business.    The majority of striking players are foreigners (jai alai originated in the Basque region of Spain in the 19th century) while most of the replacement players are from the U.S. &quot;The UAW is always saying 'buy American cars' but now they're trying to get us to fire Americans and hire foreigners,&quot; says the Bridgeport Jai Alai spokesman. &quot;It's hypocritical.&quot;    In addition to union recognition, the players are seeking improved benefits and increased reimbursement for equipment. Contracts average $30,000 for players, with just a few earning six-figure salaries.    &quot;We know we'll get an unfair-labor-practice strike ruling,&quot; says Mr. Rasmussen of the players' union.    But Leonard Myers, president of Milford (Conn.) Jai Alai, says, &quot;They have a right to try to get recognized and we have a right to fight that.&quot;    Jai-alai players tried unsuccessfully to unionize in 1968 and 1975.    The strike is being led by 26-year-old Riki Sotil, of Trumbull, Conn., who plays in Bridgeport and Hartford, and whose father, Ricardo Sotil, was a star player and a leader in previous organizing efforts. &quot;The owners were saving pennies and we were losing thousands (of dollars). Now we're losing thousands, but they're losing millions,&quot; the younger Mr. Sotil says.    As the strike continues and replacement players fill out rosters, the number of fans attending the games is slowly increasing despite loud protests from striking players outside the frontons.    &quot;I like the new players,&quot; says Giovanni D'Arcangelo of Bridgeport, who has bet on jai alai for 12 years. &quot;They play with enthusiasm and effort.&quot;    &quot;We just need time on the court,&quot; says James E. Folston, a replacement player in Milford who tried out as a tight end in spring training for the Los Angeles Raiders and the Kansas City Chiefs football teams. &quot;The only difference between a pro and an amateur is a contract.&quot;    Mr. Rasmussen of the players' union doesn't see it that way. &quot;Now you have 20-year veterans playing against people who have been playing against the Stop andamp; Shop (supermarket) wall.&quot;    &quot;Nothing is being settled while the players are striking,&quot; says Mr. Myers of the Milford fronton. &quot;It won't resolve the union question. In the long run, the more fans we alienate the more it hurts the owners and the players.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
