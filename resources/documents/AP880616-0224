Now, say some critical observers, it may be time for someweeding out.   It was only natural that fund managers would respond to aninvestment boom by trying to offer eye-catching new products. Butin so doing, many observers say, they created a lot of confusionabout what funds ought to do and are capable of doing.   Both managers and investors strayed from the basics on which theconcept of a mutual fund is founded _ investment for the long termin a diversified portfolio.   And even some of the new ideas that looked most sensible andappealing on paper turned out to be ill-conceived.   In the current issue of his United andamp; Babson Investment Report,veteran financial adviser David Sargent reports that he recentlyparticipated in an industry panel discussion on the subject:``Where have all the customers gone.''   ``My answer was twofold,'' he said. ``First, whenever the markettakes a tumble as it did last fall, the customers always vanish.But eventually they come back.   ``Second, and more important, mutual fund buyers have been soldon promises that can't be met. Performance is the name of the gamethese days, and a performance so short term that it is invariablyillusory.   ``Good investors are lucky enough if they can stay even with themarket. But the fund industry in its offerings leads to the beliefthat the market can be beaten, whether in performance or in incomeor both.   ``Thus, investors tend to be sold the fund whose recentperformance is outstanding, rather than the one which hastemporarily lagged. They end up buying high and selling low.   ``The industry, again in the name of performance, encouragespeople to try all sorts of investment gimmickry _ options,financial futures, junk bonds, sector funds, asset allocationschemes and the like _ in an attempt to `beat the market.'   ``Such funds are tough to win with unless one has the investmentskills of a Houdini. Most of us do not.''   As a case in point of an inventive idea gone wrong, the SanFrancisco brokerage firm of Sutro Inc. cited the group known asoption-income funds.   In theory, there were good results to be had in putting togethera portfolio of investments and enhancing the income on theinvestments by selling options on them.   But in 10 years of actual practice, in a wide variety of marketenvironments, a composite of five option-income funds hasconsistently lagged far behind Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stockcomposite index, Sutro analysts note.   ``The total-return performance, which, after all, is where ithas to pay off sooner or later, has never lived up to its earlypromise,'' said Sutro's Robert McIver.   ``In our opinion, the concept has been given more than enoughtime to `work' and it's time to admit that the big mutual fundformat is incompatible with the optimum performance of an optionincome strategy.''   In Sargent's view, ``The funds would be better off, we all wouldbe, if investors were simply encouraged to buy diversified commonstock funds, with only enough bonds to sweeten the current returnwhere necessary.   ``Then they could ride gradually but almost surely to success inthe stock market and have lots left over to leave to theirgrandchildren.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Fri June 17</NOTE></DOC>
