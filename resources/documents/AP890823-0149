(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Daughters and granddaughters of Confederatesoldiers ended an era Wednesday when they moved from the stately57-year-old Confederate Home for Women to a new health-care complex.   Seven women left through a back door of the home, modeled afterthe White House. It will be closed and eventually turned over to theadjacent Virginia Museum of Fine Arts.   ``I've got a beautiful room here _ I hate to give it up,'' BerthaMoore said. ``But I know how conditions are here. They need money.''   A dwindling endowment was cited by the Confederate Home board asthe main reason for the move.   A relocation committee of the board announced in April it wouldcost considerably less to move the women than to pay for repairs atthe deteriorating Confederate Home.   The announcement sparked a smattering of protest and a lawsuit bya resident of the home, Lila Lee Riddell, 98, to block the move.When her effort in Richmond Circuit Court failed, she appealed tothe Virginia Supreme Court.   Her lawyer's final effort, a motion for a temporary injunctionagainst the move until the Supreme Court hearing in September, wasrejected Tuesday in U.S. District Court.   On Wednesday, a sole representative of the Citizen's Committeefor Memorial Preservation of the Confederate Home for Ladies stoodacross the street from the home holding an American flag. Thecommittee was formed in May.   Two Civil War re-enactors donned their Confederate uniforms andgreeted each woman as she left. ``We came down here to honor them,to pay tribute,'' said Bob Smith.   As she was being wheeled out of the home she lived in for 13years, Mrs. Moore spotted a tattered, discarded doll. Mrs. Moore,88, asked for the doll and clung to it as she was hoisted in herwheelchair into a waiting van.   Their beds and some of their belongings already had been moved tothe new residence, Brandermill Woods.   Staff members fought back tears as they waved good bye.   Holly DeJarnette, administrator of the Confederate Home, andseveral other staff members will continue to work with the women atBrandermill Woods.   The seven women will move into adjoining rooms at TheChesterfield, an assisted-living center adjacent to the health-carecenter at Brandermill Woods.   The home, originally called the Home for Needy Confederate Women,was established by the 1898 General Assembly to provide care forneedy female relatives of Confederate soldiers. Upon entry to thehome, residents turned over their estates in exchange for life-longcare.   In its heyday, the home had more than 70 residents.</TEXT></DOC>
