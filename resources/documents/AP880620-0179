Both sides reported heavyfighting.   Elsewhere in the Persian Gulf region, U.S. envoy Richard Murphyarrived in the United Arab Emirates on Monday to discuss ways tobring a Middle East peace settlement and an end to the Iran-Iraqwar.   And sources said France has quietly withdrawn an aircraftcarrier from the Arabian Sea, outside the gulf, as part of Paris'agreement with Iran to restore diplomatic relations earlier thismonth.   A statement from the National Liberation Army, an Iranian rebelgroup based in Iraq, said its units around the town of Mehran shotdown an Iranian Cobra helicopter with anti-aircraft fire. Mehran is100 miles east of Baghdad, the Iraqi capital, and about 4 milesfrom the border.   The rebels, also known as the Mujahedeen Khalq, captured Mehranhours after they began an offensive at midnight Saturday. Therebels on Monday sent captured Iranian tanks and other militaryhardware back to Iraq.   Statements said the rebels, estimated in the thousands, engagedtwo divisions of Iranian Revolutionary Guards totaling about 14,000troops.   The rebels claimed 6,000 Iranian soldiers were killed or woundedand about 1,500 captured. They said 57 of their own were killed and120 seriously wounded.   Mehran has been largely deserted since the early days of theIran-Iraq war, which began in September 1980, and has changed handsat least five times.   At U.N. headquarters in New York, Iraq said Monday that theforce crossing the border to take Mehran consisted entirely ofIranians. It called the battle ``an internal Iranian affair.''   Tehran's news reports late Monday made little reference toMehran, except to say its warplanes attacked Iraqi positions fivetimes.   A communique carried by the official Islamic Republic NewsAgency said: ``Iran's Moslem combatants continued their battleswith Iraqi troops with artillery, mortar and heavy weaponry.''   The agency, monitored in Nicosia, reported ground fightinginside Iraq along the central part of the 730-mile-border war front.   It said Iraqi warplanes were spotted Monday over the centralcity of Ilam and over Kurdistan in the north. It said a Kurdishrebel group in northern Iraq mined the Kolikan-Erbil road anddestroyed two truckloads of Iraqi weapons.   Iraq said Monday its aircraft flew 406 sorties _ 119 by jetaircraft and 287 by helicopter gunships.   Although the number of missions by gunships was well below the433 reported Sunday, their activity still indicated a high level offighting on the ground.   Murphy, the assistant U.S. secretary of state in charge ofMiddle East affairs, said the United States hopes to convene aninternational peace conference on the Middle East ``as soon aspossible,'' the official United Arab Emirates news agency reported.   The envoy, in the Emirates for a one-day visit, also isdiscussing how to push through a peaceful end to the Iran-Iraq waron the basis of U.N. Security Council Resolution 598 passed in Julylast year.   The eight-nation tour will take Murphy to Iraq, which hasexpressed willingness to implement the resolution.   The 32,780-ton French carrier Clemenceau was pulled out of thegulf region in the past few weeks and a will not be replaced in theforeseeable future, according to the French sources who spoke oncondition of anonymity.   The withdrawal of the Clemenceau leaves France with about 10warships in the gulf and nearby waters. These include fourdestroyers, three frigates and a pair of minesweepers.   French sources said Iranian officials pressed for the removal ofthe Clemenceau as part of the agreement under which the twocountries restored diplomatic relations last week after an 11-monthbreak.   The 40th U.S. Navy-escorted convoy of the year was due to leavethe gulf on Monday. The group included the 290,085-ton supertankerMiddletown, the 79,999-ton tanker Ocean City and the Gas King, a46,723-ton liquefied gas carrier.   The U.S. Navy began escorting 11 U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tankers inJuly last year to protect them from attack by Iran, which considersKuwait an ally of Iraq.</TEXT></DOC>
