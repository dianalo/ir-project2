Five area air samplesaveraged 0.40f/cc, ranging from 0.06 to 0.75 f/cc. The sand reclamationarea had the two highest air concentrations of 0.48 and 0.75f/cc; therewas a malfunction in the equipment, allowing the fibers to escape throughworn seals. Most of the fibers were of respirable size. Cristobalitewas not found in any sample. Health effects noted on interview with theworkers who handled the Fiberfrax material consisted only of mild skinand face irritation. Fiber concentration levels were well below thoseregarded by NIOSH as hazardous for other types of fibrous materials.The author concludes that insufficient data are available to determinethe toxicity of ceramic fibers, but because of indications of possiblecarcinogenicity, exposure should be minimized.</TEXT></DOC>
