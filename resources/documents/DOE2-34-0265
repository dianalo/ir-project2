Atomicallyresolved scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images were taken showingdamaged areas due to individual ion impacts. Analysis of a STM imageshows a shallow impact crater, a stacking fault, displacement of Pb{sup2+} and S{sup 2-} ions from their regular surface sites, and migrationof interstitials to the surface.</TEXT></DOC>
