The proposed settlement will be submitted to the union membership for ratification later this week. Details weren't disclosed.    Canada Post, a government agency, said the work stoppage has had little effect on mail service. The union's members include administrative employees and technicians who service mail sorting machinery. Major issues in the dispute included the corporation's proposal for less restrictive job security provisions and the union's proposal for a reduction in the work week for technicians to 37 1/2 hours from 40 hours. </TEXT></DOC>
