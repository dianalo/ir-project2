Some analysts argue that the trip, which sought to reducethe trade imbalance with Japan and focused particularly onincreasing U.S. auto exports, was fundamentallyill-conceived. Daniel Roos, director of the InternationalMotor Vehicle Program at the Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology, calls the visit &quot;unfortunate from the perspectiveof showing that we as a nation don't have our act together.&quot;Even &quot;if all of the constraints on getting vehicles intoJapan were relaxed,&quot; he says, there are still real questionsabout the size of the market for American-made cars.</LP><TEXT>   But some company executives were less critical, and othersapplauded the president's initiative as an important firststep. Here is a sampling of opinions from senior corporateofficers interviewed by Wall Street Journal reporters:                                                                                                          JOHN W. TEETS   Chief Executive, Dial Corp.                                                                                                          The Big Three &quot;want the opportunity to sell their carsover there, and I'm all for that,&quot; Mr. Teets says. Butwhether Japanese consumers will buy U.S. cars is anothermatter. &quot;U.S. car makers kind of want a quota system, andthat's one step beyond what I think.   &quot;If we're going to have a free enterprise system, we haveto make a car that will compete. We want an opportunity tosell. That is what I call fair, because then the guy who isthe best at what he does, wins,&quot; Mr. Teets says.   Dial, a Phoenix, Ariz., consumer-products company, hasbeen stymied in a five-year effort to sell soap products andmicrowave meals in Japan. There are so many rules, proceduresand payments needed to get through the distribution systemthat &quot;by the time you get a product to the store you can'tafford to sell it,&quot; he says.   &quot;The fact is, they can come here and go into grocerystores and co mpete with us. We can't do the same in Japan.It isn't a level playing field, and that is a fact ofbusiness. They know it, and we know it.&quot;                                                                                                          JAMES DAVIS   President, New Balance Sneaker Co.                                                                                                          &quot;I feel all of us should concentrate more on increasingquality and productivity,&quot; Mr. Davis says, in addition topushing other markets to match the openness of the U.S.&quot;We've gone in and made a determination what the Japaneseneed in footwear. I don't know if the auto industry has donethat,&quot; he says, though he declines to comment morespecifically on the auto industry.   New Balance has done business in Japan since 1977, in asales and marketing joint venture with two Japanesecompanies. New Balance sneakers are lighter than competitors'and come in varying widths to fit Japanese feet, which Mr.Davis says are generally shorter and wider than Americanfeet.   Mr. Davis won't disclose his closely held company's salesor how much come from Japan. But 75% of New Balance productsare made in the U.S., he says. In the New York Times Friday,the company ran an ad for its shoes that read: &quot;Mr.President: Here's one American-made vehicle that has noproblem competing in Japan.&quot; Says Mr. Davis: &quot;We wanted tolet the world and the president know that in this country,workers can be competitive.&quot;                                                                                                          LEONARD JASKOL   Chief Executive, Lydall Inc.                                                                                                          Though President Bush &quot;meant well&quot; in the tradenegotiations, they weren't &quot;well conceived,&quot; says Mr. Jaskol,whose Manchester, Conn., company makes air bags and thermalbarriers for autos, in addition to fiber materials for otherproducts.   Instead of pushing American cars, the U.S. would be betteroff seeking to reduce Japanese restrictions on paper productsand food, such as rice, citrus fruits and beef, he says.&quot;I've lived in Japan. These products are high in demand, highin price and there's a clear understanding about the qualityof U.S. products.   &quot;We can be very competitive {in these markets}. Why notcorrect the trade imbalance in that way?&quot; President Bush&quot;painted himself in a corner by using automobiles as theproduct of choice and by taking a number of executives withhim without a clear understanding of how the negotiationswould come out.   &quot;These were very public negotiations. They shouldn't havebeen. They should have been very private.&quot;   The outcome of the negotiations -- a tentative plan forthe Japanese to buy 20,000 additional cars -- &quot;is so low asto be insulting,&quot; Mr. Jaskol says. Moreover, the agreement tobuy more U.S. auto parts is also dubious: &quot;I think you'regoing to see an awful lot of those parts being produced byJapanese companies in the U.S.&quot;                                                                                                          JAMES ROBINSON   Chairman, American Express Co.                                                                                                          &quot;The meeting was more successful than the credit it'sgetting,&quot; says Mr. Robinson, who participated in the tradetalks. &quot;Things aren't going to change overnight, but a numberof things were initiated in a meaningful way. A lot of stepswere taken, in financial services for instance, that overtime could produce substantial results.   &quot;In mid-February, when the U.S.-Japanese Business Councilmeets, we will sit down and look at what has been done sincethe January meetings in Japan to materially change businesspractices.   &quot;But both sides clearly understand that only a jointworking effort at the private level will make progress.&quot;                                                                                                          H. ROSS PEROT   Chairman, Perot Systems Corp.                                                                                                          &quot;I think the president taking {the U.S. executives} withhim on this trip was a serious mistake,&quot; says Mr. Perot. &quot;I'mappalled that people who supposedly understand diplomacywould show up with 21 uninvited guests&quot; bearing complaints.The trip was supposed to be a ceremonial visit to buildfriendship between the two countries, says Mr. Perot, a Texasindustrialist who sold Electronic Data Systems Corp., whichhe founded, to General Motors Corp. in 1984. He served onGM's board following the acquisition, but the relationshipwas stormy and GM paid him $700 million for all his stock in1986.   The U.S. is erring in asking the Japanese for assistancein narrowing the trade gap between the two countries, Mr.Perot says. &quot;The problems we have, they can't cure for us. Itwas a counterproductive trip, and not in our nation'sinterest.&quot;   To make matters worse, he says, the Japanese tried toaccommodate President Bush and his entourage by giving a&quot;gift&quot; of their agreements, but then the group furtheroffended them by rejecting the gift as inadequate.   &quot;Look at what's wrong: What's wrong is they make betterproducts than we do,&quot; he says. The only way to compete is to&quot;make the finest products in the world.&quot;   The visit &quot;had nothing to do with anything exceptelections and images,&quot; he says. &quot;A great tax base only comesfrom a country that makes great products and that can competeand win. This trip was just a joke.&quot;                                                                                                          JOSEPH JACOBS   Chairman and Chief Executive,   Jacobs Engineering Group Inc.                                                                                                          &quot;I think the position of the Big Three auto makers is welljustified,&quot; Dr. Jacobs says. Open markets, he adds, areimportant not only to U.S. companies, but also to Japaneseconsumers, who must pay higher prices for goods because ofrestricted competition. His Pasadena, Calif., engineering,design, construction and hazardous-waste management companydoesn't do much business in Japan, but competes with Japanesebusinesses in some international markets.   The trade spat, Dr. Jacobs adds, obscures a much moreimportant issue: that the Japanese have forced U.S. companiesto cut the fat and be competitive. &quot;The fundamental issue is:we need to be competitive.&quot;   He applauds recent announcements by General Motors andInternational Business Machines Corp. that they are slashingjobs: &quot;Businesses aren't in business to create jobs. They arein business to create profits, which may create jobs.&quot;   U.S. businesses &quot;operate with too high overheads,&quot; Dr.Jacobs says. The cutbacks at GM and IBM, he adds, are &quot;themost encouraging sign for the future of our industries. Weare cutting the fat.   &quot;Everyone is saying: At long last, the Big Three arerecognizing that they can't run as a big bureaucracy. Theyhave to be lean and mean.&quot;                                                                                                          BEN COHEN   Chairman, Ben andamp; Jerry's Homemade Inc.                                                                                                          Mr. Cohen says the U.S. could resolve its trade imbalancewith Japan by investing in the needs of the U.S. work force:better education, health care and housing.   &quot;If we invest in our work force and infrastructure, wewill begin to produce higher-quality goods, and then willagain become world leaders in terms of productivity,efficiency and quality,&quot; he says.   &quot;Forcing the Japanese to buy our stuff because we'reholding a club over their heads is really a short-term thing.The reality is that when the Big Three produce cars thatJapan wants, they will buy more cars. Right now, the stuffthey {the Big Three} produce, their own people don't want.&quot;                                                                                                          WILLIAM E. JOHNSON   Chief Executive, Scientific-Atlanta Inc.                                                                                                          &quot;This is not an overnight problem, so there aren'tovernight solutions,&quot; Mr. Johnson says.   &quot;In this country, we classically want to see resultsimmediately. But we need to be persistent, and patient.Persistence and patience are what accounts for much of theJapanese success in this country.&quot; President Bush's trip, hesays, is just a first step that must be followed up by otherofficials in the administration to show the Japanese that theU.S. is serious about the trade issue.   Noting that about 25% of the sales from histelecommunications equipment company are from abroad, hesays, &quot;we see the government as a true and essential partner,but you also have to be competitive.&quot; And the Japanese don'thold the patent on quality, he says. &quot;We manufacture in Japanas well as in the U.S. In order to maintain the quality wewant, we've had to put our people over there. In our Japanesefactory, we've had people from Atlanta there to train them.&quot;                                                                                                          HARRY KURTZMAN   Chief Executive, Aura Systems Inc.                                                                                                          The Big Three's &quot;tactics are all wrong,&quot; says Mr.Kurtzman, whose El Segundo, Calif., company is developing carcomponents such as engine mounts and suspension systems basedon magnetics technology. &quot;They should build better cars, thenthey wouldn't have a problem. I used to own a Pontiac and aChevy, and I have a Chrysler minivan now, and they're alljunky cars. I'm going to buy Mazda next time.&quot; Mr. Kurtzmansays the maneuvering over trade restrictions won't do muchgood over the long haul unless U.S. auto makers get their acttogether. &quot;Making rules just skews the system for a shortperiod of time,&quot; he says. &quot;Then the bad guy loses anyway.&quot;   As for trade rules to increase the use of American partsin Japanese autos, Mr. Kurtzman says things are alreadyprogressing well without regulations. &quot;I think you're goingto see more made-in-America parts in Japanese autos in thenear future, and they will be superior products withinnovative technologies that the Japanese don't have. TheJapanese are willing to buy components from us, but theproblem in the recent past is that we were inferior.&quot;                                                                                                          RICHARD B. MADDEN   Chairman, Potlatch Corp.                                                                                                          The head of a forest products company says he foundresults of the Bush trip &quot;extraordinarily encouraging.&quot;   Richard B. Madden, chairman of San Francisco-basedPotlatch Corp., says he's pleased with the opportunities forpaper companies emerging from the Bush-Miyazawa talks. Amajor exporter of bleached paperboard to Japan, Potlatch isalso attempting to develop a coated printing papers businessin Japan.   &quot;The Japanese agreement with the United States toestablish specific measures to substantially increase marketaccess for foreign firms exporting paper products to Japan byMarch 31, 1992, was extraordinarily encouraging,&quot; he says.&quot;The U.S. paper industry is competitive world-wide, and thepresident has opened an opportunity which we hope will permitincreasing access to the Japanese market.&quot;                                                                                                          A. MALACHI MIXON III   Chief Executive, Invacare Corp.                                                                                                          The Big Three auto executives were &quot;a very poor choice forthe president to take to Japan,&quot; says Mr. Mixon, whosecompany, in Elyria, Ohio, makes home medical equipment.   &quot;The auto makers are losing in the real, free-marketworld. It takes them twice as long to develop an auto, andthey don't have the quality. They're a bunch of crybabies, asfar as I'm concerned. It's not the representative industry inAmerica where quality is really occurring.   &quot;Our cars aren't going to sell as well in Japan asJapanese cars because they aren't as good. American companieshave to learn to compete in world markets, and I think theJapanese got ahead of America in manufacturing and quality.   Still, he says, &quot;everybody has a legitimate complaintabout access to Japanese markets. I think we should continueto demand access to their market, though not by restrictingJapanese products in our market. But if, in the finalanalysis, they're going to continue to make it extremelydifficult to sell in their market, then appropriate restraintis fair. We need to have a Japanese government that's willingto help American companies sell their products.&quot;                                                                                                          CRAIG R. BARRETT   Executive Vice President, Intel Corp.                                                                                                          &quot;It's certainly nice to see the president start to worryabout jobs and the standard of living in the U.S. The effortin Japan is a step in that direction. But there's a questionmark as to whether this was just political or if somethingsystemic will take place.&quot;   He complains that President Bush might have stressed tradein growing industries such as electronics rather than autos.&quot;The issues with Toys `R' Us and the autos doesn't generatewarmth in our hearts. . . . I'm hoping that what he's doingisn't just placating Iacocca. Some policy associated withindustries of the future would be nice instead of justworrying about autos. . . . The automobile guys carry withthem the aura of doing most everything wrong and then cryingafter the fact.&quot;   On possible outcomes of Bush's trip, he says: &quot;Historysuggests that precious little will happen. The governmentought to make sure they put some teeth behind this thing thistime so it doesn't end up like every other one.&quot;   As for taking along highly paid executives, he adds: &quot;Iwanted to go because I know if I did, maybe my salary wouldgo up four or five times.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
