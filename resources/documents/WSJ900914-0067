If the UAW'scontract expires without a settlement, the union could hobbleGM's operations with a national strike, or a series of localwalkouts.   However, the two sides could easily extend their talksinto the weekend without much disruption of GM's operations.   UAW officials have scheduled a meeting Monday in Detroitfor all their top local union officials. Some UAW officialsspeculated the meeting was called to give them details of anagreement, but they also said the meeting could be used todiscuss strike strategies if bargainers fail to reachagreement.   The pace of the talks at GM quickened markedly onWednesday, after GM Chairman Robert Stempel, along withAlfred S. Warren, a GM vice president and the company's topbargainer, met with UAW President Owen Bieber and Stephen P.Yokich, the UAW's top GM bargainer.   Now, negotiations are at a level where, instead of dozensof people involved in meetings, gatherings are limited to ahandful of high-level officials on both sides.   &quot;We're really at a very intense time of these talks,&quot; saida GM spokesman. &quot;We've made a lot of progress but there arestill some hard issues to get at.&quot;   The toughest issues surround the UAW's demands that GMworkers get virtually ironclad job and income securityguarantees. GM's current job security package is an intricateweb of provisions that allows layoffs only under certainconditions, such as a sales slump. Idled workers get aportion of their weekly take-home pay from a special fund.   When funds for these programs are full, laid-off workerscan earn almost 95% of their take-home pay for up to twoyears. However, massive layoffs at GM over the last threeyears have drained the fund and caused workers to be paidlower benefit levels for shorter time periods. Moreover, GMhas used loopholes in the contract to close four assemblyplants and several parts-making facilities since 1987. Atleast two more GM assembly plants in the U.S. are scheduledto close by 1992.   The UAW has demanded sweeping changes in the currentsystem, and GM negotiators are understood to have proposedboosting the levels of funding for some of the incomesecurity programs. Perhaps more importantly, GM is signalingit is willing to enhance pension benefits to induce workersto retire.   According to one analyst, GM needs about 20,000 workers toretire or otherwise leave the company annually over thecourse of the three-year agreement. That would lead toproductivity gains of about 5% a year, which would virtuallyoffset the amount that labor costs could increase during theterm of a new contract.   That sounds simple. But in practice, it isn't, becausesome of GM's attrition will come from outright plantshutdowns. So UAW bargainers are pressing GM to makesubstantial income guarantees to workers who are laid off,but who aren't ready to retire or willing to move to jobs atother GM locations.   Meanwhile, neither the company nor the union would commenton reports that a deal has been struck on wages. In itsinitial proposal to GM three weeks ago, the company proposeda 2% base wage increase in the first year of a three yeardeal, followed by lump sum payments of 2% in each of thefollowing years.   GM officials also continue to seek changes in health-carebenefits. UAW workers at GM benefit from one of the mostgenerous health-care plans in the manufacturing sector. GMofficials had proposed requiring UAW employees to pay for agreater portion of their health-care benefits. Although thecompany has softened its aggressive health-care proposal fromthe earlier stages of bargaining, GM continues to seek waysto cut health-care costs.   In a related matter, GM and the Electric Workers unionextended their contract past today's deadline. A GM spokesmancharacterized the extension as a normal move the ElectricWorkers make to await the outcome of the UAW talks. TheElectric Workers union represents 24,000 people at factoriesscattered around the country that build parts for GMvehicles.</TEXT></DOC>
