Background</ITAG>EPA issued a final rule under TSCA section 4(a)(1)(A) and (B), publishedin the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of February 26, 1988 (53 FR 5932), that establishedhealth effects testing requirements for DGBE and DGBA. The rule requireddermal pharmacokinetics testing in rats to determine the absorption andbiotransformation of DGBE administered dermally, and the dermal absorptionof DGBA. The test standard, in 40 CFR 795.225(b)(2)(iv)(E), required thatrats be dosed once dermally, and that the dose be kept on the skin forthe duration of the study (96 hours). After dosing, the animals were tobe placed in metabolism cages for excreta collection for at least 96 hoursand, if necessary, daily thereafter until at least 90 percent of the dosehad been excreted, or until 7 days after dosing. The final rule requiredcompletion of this test and submission of a final report by April 11, 1989,12 months after the effective date of the final rule, 40 CFR 799.1560(c)(4)(ii).On July 25, 1988, the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA) contactedEPA concerning the pharmacokinetics test requirement to occlude the dosedarea with an aluminum patch secured in place with adhesive tape, 40 CFR795.225(b)(2)(ii)(B). CMA requested that the test sponsor, Eastman Kodak,be allowed to use a glass containment device to occlude the dosed areainstead of the aluminum foil patch required by the test standard (Ref.1). EPA requested that CMA submit a formal request to make this change.CMA did so on September 8, 1988 (Ref. 2).In the interim, CMA reported difficulties with test substance leakage andwith keeping the glass cell containment device on the animals' backs formore than 24 hours (Ref. 3). EPA officials had several discussions anda meeting with CMA and Eastman Kodak concerning alternative techniqueswhich might enable a 96-hour dermal exposure (Refs. 5 and 6). EPA alsogave CMA a copy of a similar study which had achieved a 96-hour dermalexposure time (Refs. 8 and 9). As a result, the Eastman Kodak laboratoryconducted a number of pilot studies to test different wrapping techniques,occlusive devises, and brands of glue (Refs. 2, 6, 10). None of these studieswas successful in maintaining the test substance in contact with the animals'backs for more than 24 to 48 hours (Ref. 2).CMA, therefore, proposed that the requirement to keep the test substanceon the animals' backs be reduced from 96 hours to 24 hours. CMA also requestedthat the requirement to occlude the dosed area with an aluminum patch beeliminated because it had been shown to be ineffective (Ref. 2). CMA proposedthat any test material remaining on the skin 24 hours after applicationbe washed off at that time and the cell removed. Radiolabelled materialin the wash would be accounted for in the total recovery, and excreta wouldcontinue to be collected and analyzed at 48, 72, and 96 hours, and dailythereafter up to 7 days if necessary. CMA also proposed repeating the alreadycompleted low dose DGBA study using this procedure so that the test methodologieswould be comparable, even though it appeared that all the low dose DGBAhad been absorbed by 24 hours (Ref. 2).Precedent exists for this proposed modification, since other section 4rules and consent orders have required dermal exposure times of 24 hoursor less. The only other final test rule, besides DGBE and DGBA, which requireda dermal pharmacokinetics test with a 96-hour exposure period was 2-ethylhexanoicacid (EHA), 40 CFR 799.1650 (Ref. 7). Eastman Kodak was also the test sponsorfor this experiment with EHA. No leakage problems were encountered withEHA, however, because EHA was absorbed before the glass cells dislodgedfrom the animals' backs (Ref. 4).In the course of the discussions between EPA and CMA, EPA suggested andCMA agreed that a neat (i.e. undiluted, nonaqueous) low dose would makethe data more comparable to the neat high dose in the pharmacokineticsstudy, and would avoid introducing confusion due to the different absorptionproperties of water (Ref. 6). At the same time, there are advantages tohaving an aqueous low dose of DGBE. The low dose allows comparison withthe aqueous low dose of DGBE in the subchronic toxicity and neurotoxicitystudies (Ref. 2). It also mimics a common condition of human exposure,in which a DGBE-containing product is diluted in water. Kodak has, therefore,volunteered to add another group of eight animals so that the low-doseDGBE experiment could be done with both aqueous and neat doses (REf. 2).Accordingly, EPA proposes this modification and believes it will producemore useful results.CMA did not offer to conduct a neat low-dose test with DGBA, although,as with DGBE, it would improve comparability of low-dose and high dosedata.There is less reason to use an aqueous low dose of DGBA, since it is notdiluted in water in consumer applications. Further, there are no requiredstudies of DGBA with a aqueous dilutions that EPA could compare with theabsorption studies. Although not specifically required by the test standard,it is EPA's understanding that Eastman Kodak will use an aqueous low doseDGBA.Eastman Kodak has suspended the pharmacokinetics testing of DGBE and DBGAuntil the problems discussed above can be resolved. CMA has requested anextension of the reporting deadline for the pharmacokinetics study thatwould require submission of final reports 10 months after CMA is notifiedabout EPA's decision concerning the proposed modifications. Kodak supportedCMA's request with a detailed plan listing the time to complete key studyphases (Ref. 10). EPA agrees that the reporting deadlines should be extended.However, due to the considerable experience that Eastman Kodak has hadto date in attempting to perform this test, and the fact that certain studyphases can be run concurrently, EPA believes that 8 months is sufficientto complete the test and submit results.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Proposed Modifications</ITAG>Based on the difficulties encountered and documented by Eastman Kodak inattempting to perform the pharmacokinetics test of DGBE and DGBA as requiredby the section 4 test rule, EPA proposes to modify the pharmacokineticstest standard as follows:Section 795.225(b)(2)(iv)(E) will require that the test substance be kepton the animal for 24 hours instead of 96 hours. After 24 hours, any testmaterial remaining on the skin will be washed off and the containment cellremoved. Radiolabeled material in the wash will be accounted for in thetotal recovery. Urine and feces will be collected at 8, 24, 48, 72, and96 hours after dosing, and if necessary, daily thereafter until at least90 percent of the dose has been excreted or until 7 days after dosing (whicheveroccurs first).Under andSection; 795.225(b)(2)(ii)(B), EPA proposes to eliminate the requirementto occlude the dosed area with an aluminum foil patch secured in placewith adhesive tape.In order to produce better data, CMA has volunteered to test two low dosesof DGBE, one neat and one a 10 percent aqueous solution. EPA, therefore,proposes that andSection; 795.225(b)(2)(ii)(A) be modified to reflect this.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Proposed Extension</ITAG>Due to the need to suspend pharmacokinetics testing because of technicalproblems, it is proposed that the reporting deadlines under andSection; 799.1560(c)(4)(ii)(A) and (B) be modified to allow 8 months from the effective date of theamendment for the completion of the test and submission of final results.One progress report would be due 6 months after the effective date of thefinal amendment.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Economic Analysis</ITAG>The modifications in this proposed amendment will not significantly alterthe cost of testing. Thus, the economic analysis for the final test rulefor DGBE and DGBA is unchanged.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Issue for Comment</ITAG>Should the low dose of DGBA be administered neat for better comparisonwith the neat high dose, or would an aqueous dilution of the low dose whichis equal in volume to the high dose be a better study of absorption properties?<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Public Meetings</ITAG>If persons indicate to EPA that they wish to present oral comments on thisproposed amendment to EPA officials who are directly responsible for developingthe amendment and supporting analyses, EPA will hold a public meeting afterthe close of the public comment period in Washington, DC. Persons who wishto attend or to present comments at the meeting should call the TSCA AssistanceOffice (TAO): (202) 554-1404, by May 1, 1989. A meeting will not be heldif members of the public do not indicate that they wish to make oral presentations.While the meeting will be open to the public, active participation willbe limited to those persons who arrange to present comments and to designatedEPA participants. Persons wishing to attend should call the TAO beforemaking travel plans to verify whether a meeting will be held.Should a meeting be held, EPA would transcribe the meeting and includethe written transcript in the rule-making record. Participants are invited,but not required, to submit copies of their statements prior to or on theday of the meeting. All such written materials will become part of EPA'srecord for this rulemaking.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII.
