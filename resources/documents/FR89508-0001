As explainedin greater detail in the <T2>Supplementary Information </T2>accompanying the interim rule publishedDecember 30, 1988, this change is mandated by section 301(e) of the UnitedStates-Canada Free-Trade Implementation Act of 1988 (the Act), and is necessaryto conform the Federal Seed Act Regulations (the regulations) with theAct.<ITAG tagnum="84">Comments</ITAG>Comments on the interim rule were required to be postmarked or receivedon or before February 28, 1989. We received two comments that were timely.Both commenters supported removal of the staining requirement for seedof alfalfa or red clover that was certified as to genetic purity, in accordancewith andSection;andSection;201.67-201.76 of the regulations, by a qualifiedcertifying agency. The commenters were concerned that seed could be importedinto Canada from other countries and imported into the United States asCanadian seed. Certification is not a requirement for importing seed intothe United States.The Act removes our statutory authority to require staining of alfalfaor red clover seed that is grown in Canada and imported into the UnitedStates. The removal of the staining requirement is not limited to certifiedseed. Therefore, no change is made on the basis of these comments.Under the regulations, seed offered for importation into the United Statesmust be labelled to show origin, if known. Such seed must be accompaniedby a Declaration of Labeling setting forth the information that is on orattached to the containers of the seed, including, among other things,a statement of origin of the seed. The regulations also provide that seedthat is offered for importation into the United States shall be refusedadmission for false or misleading labelling. These regulatory requirementscontinue to apply to seed of alfalfa or red clover that is imported intothe United States from Canada and should allay the commenters' concerns.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291 and Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>This rule deletes a regulatory requirement which is no longer authorizedby the Federal Seed Act because of its amendment. It has therefore beendetermined that it is not a ``major rule'' within the meaning of ExecutiveOrder 12291 and Departmental regulation 1512-1. For the same reason, itis not subject to regulatory analysis under the Regulatory FlexibilityAct. <ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>The regulations in this rule contain no information collection or recordkeepingrequirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, as amended (44U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>).<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 201</ITAG>Advertising, Agricultural commodities, Imports, Labelling, Reporting andrecordkeeping requirements, Seeds, Vegetables.<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 201_FEDERAL SEED ACT REGULATIONS</ITAG>Accordingly, we are adopting as a final rule, without change, the interimrule that amended 7 CFR Part 201 and that was published at 53 FR 52973-52974on December 30, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="21">Done in Washington, DC, this 3rd day of May 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James W.
