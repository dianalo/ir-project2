For Mr. van Heerden, the director general of foreign affairs, this has been the easy part. Convincing South African President P.W. Botha and his security-obsessed cabinet to accept these terms will be much more difficult.    &quot;For Mr. van Heerden, the road from his office to New York is shorter than the road from his office to the president's office,&quot; says Peter Vale, the director of the Institute of Social and Economic Research at South Africa's Rhodes University. &quot;The hardest part of all this will be selling it to P.W. Botha and the security establishment.&quot;    Peace in Southern Africa -- or at least negotiations to achieve it -- has been close at hand before, only to be upset by Pretoria's belligerence. In 1986, for example, a team of British Commonwealth officials, known as the EPG, reportedly was on the verge of bringing the South African government and the African National Congress, or ANC, the outlawed liberation movement, to the negotiating table. But those efforts went up in smoke when South Africa's military launched bombing raids on several neighboring countries, claiming to be in pursuit of ANC guerrillas.    The South African government, which is expected to meet this week to consider the New York proposals, is composed of hawks and superhawks; there aren't any doves in the usual sense of the word. The hawks, mainly diplomats in the foreign ministry, have been encouraging the peace talks with Angola and Cuba in the hope that South Africa can win some concessions during the final months of the Reagan administration, which is eager to arrange a settlement in Southern Africa. At the same time, these officials figure the talks will give South Africa a more moderate image internationally at a time when it continues to tighten the repression of opposition groups at home.    The superhawks, primarily military and security officials, have thus far nervously tolerated the negotiations. But if the proposed settlement is seen to interfere with their efforts to combat what they call the &quot;total onslaught&quot; from the ANC, the superhawks will be loath to accept it, and may even attempt to sabotage it.    &quot;You can almost see another EPG coming now,&quot; says Mr. Vale. &quot;There are some elements in the government who are strongly opposed to settling.&quot;    South African troops have been involved in Angola since 1975. At first, this intervention was designed to get Pretoria a say in determining the post-independence course of Angola. By aiding Jonas Savimbi's UNITA rebels, which are also supported by the U.S., Pretoria was hoping to dislodge Angola's Marxist government. Over the years, however, South Africa's presence in Angola became an integral part of its strategy to repel the total onslaught by keeping communism at bay in Angola and striking at the nests of the ANC, which does much of its military training there.    At the same time, South Africa has been clinging to Namibia in defiance of a 1978 U.N. resolution calling for that country's independence. South Africa maintains that it has kept control of Namibia as leverage to get Cuba out of Angola, but Namibia also serves as a strategic buffer between South Africa and the twin perils of communism and the ANC. Clearing out of Angola and Namibia now could put the ANC on South Africa's doorstep.    &quot;It's the same argument used by the U.S. in Vietnam: We have to fight them there or we will be fighting them in New Mexico,&quot; says Frederick van Zyl Slabbert, a former parliamentary opposition leader. &quot;As a result, we are trapped in a civil war on foreign soil.&quot;    As this trap tightens, the South African government is coming under increased domestic pressure to withdraw all troops from neighboring countries. The business community -- including even Afrikaans business executives -- has stepped up its criticism of the government's defense outlays, estimated to be $2 billion a year in Angola and northern Namibia. More importantly, the country's whites are asking why more and more of their sons are being killed and wounded beyond the borders.    Since last September, when South Africa intervened heavily to assist UNITA against an Angolan-Cuban offensive, more than 50 white soldiers, most of them fresh out of high school, have been killed in fighting in southern Angola and on the Angola-Namibian border. (The government doesn't release casualty figures for black battalions or mercenaries fighting on its side.)    After the latest battle, when 12 whites were killed in an air attack at a dam near Calueque, Angola, Die Kerkbode, the official journal of the Dutch Reformed Church, said, &quot;the more or less permanent presence&quot; of South African troops in Angola could be questioned on &quot;Christian ethical grounds.&quot; Its concern that South Africa could be drawn deeper into a war on foreign soil with increasing casualties touched off a lively debate among church members, most of whom are supporters of the ruling National Party.    &quot;We have to be very careful with the use of our personnel,&quot; concedes a Defense Department spokesman. &quot;We can't afford big losses.&quot;    This alone would make Pretoria reluctant to slug it out in Angola. But recent battles have indicated that South Africa may also be losing its military superiority. Cuba, which has as many as 50,000 soldiers in Angola, is known to have introduced much more sophisticated weaponry into the battle after the September fighting. Following the attack at Calueque, military experts inside and outside the country have begun wondering whether South Africa has even lost its edge in the skies over Angola.    The South African military vehemently denies this and has launched a public relations offensive to prove that it is still the strongest army around. </TEXT></DOC>
