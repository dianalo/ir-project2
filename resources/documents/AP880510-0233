Bearing a cross and two Polish flags, they marched slowly fromthe yard, the 1980 birthplace of Solidarity, shortly after 8 p.m.(2 p.m. EDT). Police stepped back silently and let them pass.   Townspeople applauded from balconies and sidewalks as theprocession walked three blocks to St. Brygida's Church, astronghold of Solidarity.   As the workers approached, bells pealed and supporters rushed toembrace Walesa and other strike leaders, offering them flowers andkisses.   ``We thank you. We thank you!,'' the crowd chanted.   Walesa was a founder of Solidarity, the Soviet bloc's first andonly independent trade union movement. The federation was outlawedin 1982, but the workers declared Tuesday night, ``It's a newspring for Solidarity.''   Walesa was not among those who launched this strike on May 2,but he vowed to be ``the last to leave.''   At the church, Walesa shrugged off questions, saying only, ``Nofreedom without Solidarity.'' After his wife Danuta embraced him,he teased her: ``Who's taking care of the house?''   The Walesas have eight children.   Up to Tuesday night, police had kept a tight blockade around thesprawling shipyard, whose towering cranes dominate the skyline ofthis Baltic port city. ``We decided to make a sovereign decision toleave the shipyard without an agreement with the authorities,''said a statement issued by the strikers.   The workers decided Tuesday evening to end the sit-in strike forhigher pay and union rights. The strike committee recommended themove in a 13-2 vote, strikers said.   It was the last in a string of five strikes that began April 25,Poland's worst wave of labor unrest since the 1981 martial lawcrackdown.   ``We are convinced that we were right in the protest againstrelations in Poland, against treating us in a way that violateshuman dignity, against the arrogance of the authorities who areresponsible for the crisis,'' the workers' statement said.   ``Poland is deep in crisis and the authorities treat the countryas their own property. We leave not in triumph but with raisedheads. Our strike should make everybody aware that one has to fightto win.''   The statement concluded: ``It's a new spring for Solidarity.''   ``I think we accomplished something. We gained general agreementon the other side that we exist,'' said Piotr Konopka, an aide toWalesa.   Walesa, 44, and winner of the 1983 Nobel Peace Prize, stillworks as an electrician at the 12,000-worker Lenin shipyard. Mostof his 1,000 followers who remained on strike to the end were intheir late teens and early 20s.   Roman Catholic Bishop Tadeusz Goclowski of Gdansk, whoseintervention paved the way for the first talks with managementSaturday, expressed joy at the strikers' decision, saying:   ``The strike ended at the initiative of the striking Polishworkers. I express my hope that the authorities will respect theirpromises to guarantee their (workers') personal and professionalsafety.''   He said he hoped recently imprisoned activists now would bereleased.   The state-run news agency PAP briefly reported the men'sdeparture from the yard.   State-run television announced the strike's end and showedpolice pulling down banners in the deserted yard. There was noimmediate official statement. Nothing was said about when theshipyard would reopen.   Strike committee chairman Alojzy Szablewski, a 62-year-oldengineer once imprisoned for leading a strike at the yard, said,``We didn't lose anything. The Communists lost. ... I wanted toavoid the police taking them out. There were many wonderful youngmen there, and I could not allow them to be beaten.''   ``Solidarity lives, fights and will win,'' said the Rev. HenrykJankowski, pastor of St. Brygida's and a Solidarity adviser, asabout 4,000 strikers and supporters gathered for a prayer service.   Talks had broken off Monday after strikers rejected a managementoffer that would have made them abandon their quest to legalizeSolidarity.   After the alleged detention and beating of two striker courierslate Monday, strikers complained of increasing difficulty ingetting food into the shipyard.   Early Tuesday, government spokesman Jerzy Urban said the absenceof further strikes in Poland proved ``the strikes and protests havenot won the support of the working class and society.''   Referring to the 1980-81 labor turmoil, he said workers decided``not to enter the same river twice, a river in which we all caughta bad cold.''   The strikers had demanded monthly raises of at least $38 basedon their current average of about $105; reinstatement of firedSolidarity activists, recognition of a Solidarity local at theyard, freedom for political prisoners and amnesty for strikers.   They announced a new demand Tuesday: ``Preservation of theshipyard in its present status.'' It came after management said theyard's future was uncertain because of financial difficulties.   Walesa, who led the hostoric August 1980 strike, initiallydistanced himself from this stoppage. But he was gradually drawninto it and the younger generation of workers _ the backbone of thestrike _ treated him as unofficial leader.   Police staged a raid Thursday to crush a strike at the Leninsteelworks in Nowa Huta in southern Poland.   Other strikes in the labor unrest were settled peacefully: at aheavy machinery plant in Stalowa Wola, and by transit workers inthe cities of Bydgoszcz and Szczecin.   On Tuesday, Urban told his weekly news conference in Warsaw thegovernment was retreating from a proposal to ban all strikes.</TEXT></DOC>
