The network, which announced its fall schedule Friday, isdumping ``The Equalizer'' and ``Beauty andamp; the Beast,'' but keepingcritically praised but low-rated ``Tour of Duty.''   It also is bringing back TV veterans Richard Chamberlain andLindsay Wagner in new series. Chamberlain will play a Hawaii doctorand Wagner a zookeeper.   NBC announced a basically unchanged prime-time schedule earlierthis week. ABC is scheduled to announce its 1989-90 fall lineupnext week. The new season begins Sept. 18.   To quiet the expected howls over taking ``Beauty andamp; the Beast''off the schedule, CBS Entertainment President Kim LeMasters said:``We are not abandoning the show.''   He said the network has ordered 12 episodes as ``backup.''   ``We don't want to rush it on the air, because it needs a littlebit of work, and we want to tend to it, because we consider it aprecious commodity to our schedule,'' LeMasters said.   The producers were unconvinced, however.   ``They went out to murder the show,'' said Paul Witt ofWitt-Thomas Productions, which also produces the canceled``Heartland.''   ``They did give us a backup order for 12 shows, but that's aface-saving gesture,'' he said. ``We're not angry yet. We're stilltoo stunned.''   ``Beauty andamp; the Beast'' had emerged as the only hit among CBS'new shows in the 1987-88 season. This season, delayed by thewriters' strike of last summer, it was taken off the airtemporarily and tried in other time periods. Its ratings dropped.   As for ``The Equalizer,'' LeMasters said, it ``was a very, verytough call,'' but was dropped because of lackluster ratings. Thecrime drama had been on the air for four seasons.   The Vietnam War drama ``Tour of Duty'' remained for its thirdseason despite mediocre ratings.   ``It deserves to be on the schedule,'' said LeMasters. ``It saysa lot about our network and the kind of shows we want to beassociated with.''   ``Paradise,'' a Western starring Lee Horsley, and ``MurphyBrown,'' a comedy starring Candice Bergen as a network newswoman,were the only new shows brought back for a second season.   CBS is adding three new half-hour comedies to Monday night in anattempt to bolster ``Murphy Brown,'' ``Designing Women'' and``Newhart.''   Other returning series included ``Murder, She Wrote,'' ``Jakeand the Fatman'' and ``Wiseguy'' and the durable soaps ``KnotsLanding,'' ``Dallas'' and ``Falcon Crest.'' New dramas were addedto Tuesday night instead of made-for-TV movies.   All three of the news division's prime-time shows made the cut:``60 Minutes,'' ``48 Hours'' and ``West 57th,'' the latter to be``reformatted'' with the additon of anchorwoman Connie Chung.   ``Rescue: 911,'' a midseason replacement, also returns.   Gone are midseason replacements ``Live In'' and ``Heartland''and the long-running ``Kate andamp; Allie,'' whose stars had not wantedto return for another season.   The new comedies are: ``Major Dad,'' starring Gerald McRaney(``Simon andamp; Simon'') as a newlywed and recently retired Marine;``The People Next Door,'' a fantasy starring Jeffrey Jones as acartoonist whose imaginings turn real, co-starring Mary Gross ashis psychologist wife; and ``The Famous Teddy Z,'' from ``Frank'sPlace'' creator Hugh Wilson, starring Jon Cryer (``Pretty inPink'') as a young, hotshot Hollywood agent.   The new hourlong shows are: ``Wolf,'' starring Jack Scalia as anex-cop working to clear his name; Chamberlain's tentatively titled``The Hawaiian''; Wagner's ``A Peaceable Kingdom''; ``Top of theHill,'' starring William Katt as an idealistic surfer elected tofill the unexpired term of his ailing congressman father; and``Snoops,'' starring Tim and Daphne Reid, formerly of ``Frank'sPlace,'' as Washington professionals _ he a noted criminologist,she a protocol officer at the State Department.
