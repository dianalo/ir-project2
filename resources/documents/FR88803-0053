The Proposed Decision sets forth the proceduresthat the DOE has tentatively formulated to distribute crude oil overchargefunds obtained from New York Petroleum, Inc., Chevron U.S.A. Inc., PattonOil Company and Ladd Petroleum Corporation. The funds are being held ininterest-bearing escrow accounts pending distribution by the DOE.The DOE has tentatively decided to distribute these funds in accordancewith the DOE's Modified Statement of Restitutionary Policy Concerning CrudeOil Cases, 51 FR 27899 (August 4, 1986). Under the Modified Policy, crudeoil overcharge moneys are divided among the states, the federal government,and injured purchasers of refined products. Under the plan we are proposing,refunds to the states would be distributed in proportion to each state'sconsumption of petroleum products during the period of price controls.Refunds to eligible purchasers would be based on the number of gallonsof petroleum products which they purchased and the extent to which theycan demonstrate injury.Applications for refund should not be filed at this time. Appropriate publicnotice will be given when the submission of claims is authorized.Any member of the public may submit written comments regarding the proposedrefund procedures. Commenting parties are requested to submit two copiesof their comments. Comments must be submitted within 30 days of publicationof this notice in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>and should be sent to the address set forth atthe beginning of this notice. All comments received will be available forpublic inspection between the hours of 1 p.m. and 5 p.m., Monday throughFriday, except Federal holidays, in the Public Reference Room of the Officeof Hearings and Appeals, located in room 1E-234, 1000 Independence AvenueSW., Washington, DC 20585.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: July 26, 1988</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">George B.

These procedures are used to refund monies to those injuredby actual or alleged violations of the DOE price regulations. The ERA has filed four Petitions for the Implementation of Special RefundProcedures for crude oil overcharge funds obtained from New York Petroleum,Inc. (NYP), Chevron U.S.A. Inc., Patton Oil Company, and Ladd PetroleumCorporation.\1\<NOTE/> These four firms remitted a total of $7.2 million to theDOE. An additional $279,000 in interest has accrued on that amount as ofJune 30, 1988. This Proposed Decision and Order sets forth the OHA's planto distribute these funds. Comments are solicited. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ On June 29, 1984, the OHA issued a final Decision andOrder concerning the petition to implement refund procedures for the crudeoil overcharge funds obtained from NYP pursuant to a court approved settlement.<T3>See </T3>New York Petroleum, Inc., 12 DOE andpara; 85,047 (1984). ThatDecision established procedures for a first-stage refund process only.We specifically noted that no procedures were being adopted at that timefor the final disposition of any funds remaining after all meritoriousfirst-stage claims wree paid. Two refund applications were received inthat proceeding, and one refund was granted. <T3>See </T3>New York Petroleum, Inc./Ashland Oil, Inc., 16 DOE andpara;85,613 (1987). We now propose to distribute the $115,580.42 in residualfunds in the NYP escrow account, plus accrued interest, pursuant to theprocedures set forth in this Decision. <ITAG tagnum="28">Ladd Petroleum Corporation remitted $2,887,611.31 to the DOE pursuantto a July 27, 1987 Judgment of the United States District Court for theEastern District of Louisiana. Chevron U.S.A. Inc. remitted $3,092,414.21pursuant to Consent Order Number RGFE006A1W, and Patton Oil Company remitted$1,110,940.14 pursuant to Consent Order Number 810C00323Z. </ITAG>The general guidelines which the OHA may use to formulate and implementa plan to distribute refunds are set forth in 10 CFR Part 205, SubpartV. The Subpart V process may be used in situations where the DOE cannotreadily identify the persons who may have been injured as a result of actualor alleged violations of the regulations or ascertain the amount of therefund each person should receive. For a more detailed discussion of SubpartV and the authority of the OHA to fashion procedures to distribute refunds,see Office of Enforcement, 8 DOE andpara; 82,508 (1981), and Office of Enforcement,8 DOE andpara; 82,597 (1981). We have considered the ERA's requests to implementSubpart V procedures with respect to the monies received from the fourfirms listed above, and have determined that such procedures are appropriate.<ITAG tagnum="84">I. Background </ITAG>On July 28, 1986, the DOE issued a Modified Statement of RestitutionaryPolicy Concerning Crude Oil Overcharges, 51 FR 27899 (August 4, 1986) (``theMSRP''). The MSRP, issued as a result of the court-approved SettlementAgreement in In Re: The Department of Energy Stripper Well Exemption Litigation,M.D.L. No. 378 (D. Kan.), provides that crude oil overcharge funds willbe divided among the States, the Federal Government, and injured purchasersof refined petroleum products. Under the MSRP, up to 20 percent of thesecrude oil overcharge funds will be reserved initially to satisfy validclaims by injured purchasers of petroleum products. Eighty percent of thefunds, and monies remaining after all valid claims are paid, are to bedisbursed equally to the States and Federal Government for indirect restitution.The OHA has been applying the MSRP to all Subpart V proceedings involvingalleged crude oil violations. See Order Implementing the MSRP, 51 FR 29689(August 20, 1986). That Order provided a period of 30 days for the filingof any objections to the application of the MSRP, and solicited commentsconcerning the appropriate procedures to follow in processing refund applicationsin crude oil refund proceedings. On April 10, 1987, the OHA issued a Notice analyzing the numerous commentswhich it received in response to the August 1986 Order. 52 FR 11737. TheNotice set forth generalized procedures and provided guidance to assistclaimants that wish to file refund applications for crude oil monies underthe Subpart V regulations. All applicants for refunds would be requiredto document their purchase volumes of petroleum products during the periodof price controls and to prove that they were injured by the alleged overcharges.The Notice indicated that end-users of petroleum products whose businessesare unrelated to the petroleum industry will be presumed to have absorbedthe crude oil overcharges, and need not submit any further proof of injuryto receive a refund. Finally, we stated that refunds would be calculatedon the basis of a per gallon refund amount derived by dividing crude oilviolation amounts by the total consumption of petroleum products in theUnited States during the period of price controls. The numerator wouldinclude the crude oil overcharge monies that were in the DOE's escrow accountat the time of the settlement and a portion of the funds in the M.D.L.378 escrow at the time of the settlement. The DOE has applied these procedures in numerous cases since the April1987 Notice, see, e.g., Shell Oil Co., 17 DOE andpara; 85,204 (1988), andErnest A. Allerkamp, 17 DOE andpara;85,079 (1988), and the procedures havebeen approved by the United States District Court for the District of Kansas.Various States had filed a Motion with that Court, claiming that the OHAviolated the Settlement Agreement by employing presumptions of injury forend-users and by improperly calculating the refund amount to be used inthose proceedings. On August 17, 1987, Judge Theis issued an Opinion andOrder denying the States' Motion in its entirety. The court concluded thatthe Settlement Agreement ``does not bar OHA from permitting claimants toemploy reasonable presumptions in affirmatively demonstrating injury entitlingthem to a refund.'' In Re: The Department of Energy Stripper Well ExemptionLitigation, 3 Fed. Energy Guidelines andpara; 26,587 at 26,826 (D. Kan. 1987). The court also ruled that, as specified in the April 1987 Notice, theOHA could calculate refunds based on a portion of the M.D.L. 378 overcharges.Id. at 26,827. The States have appealed the latter ruling. In Re: The Departmentof Energy Stripper Well Exemption Litigation, No. 10-76 (Temp. Emer. Ct.App. filed Nov. 5, 1987). <ITAG tagnum="84">II. The Proposed Refund Procedures </ITAG>A. Refund Claims We now propose to apply the procedures discussed in the April 1987 Noticeto the crude oil Subpart V proceedings that are the subject of the presentdetermination. As noted above, $7.2 million in alleged crude oil violationamounts is covered by this Proposed Decision. We have decided to reserveinitially the full 20 percent of the alleged crude oil violation amounts,or $1.44 million (plus interest) for direct refunds to claimants, in orderto ensure that sufficient funds will be available for refunds to injuredparties. The amount of the reserve may be adjusted downward later if circumstanceswarrant. The process which the OHA will use to evaluate claims based on allegedcrude oil violations will be modeled after the process the OHA has usedin Subpart V proceedings to evaluate claims based upon alleged overchargesinvolving refined products. See Mountain Fuel Supply Co., 14 DOE andpara;85, 475 (1986). As in non-crude oil cases, applicants will be required to document theirpurchase volumes and to prove that they were injured as a result of thealleged violations. Applicants who were end-users or ultimate consumersof petroleum products, whose businesses are unrelated to the petroleumindustry, and who were not subject to the DOE price regulations are presumedto have absorbed rather than passed on alleged crude oil overcharges. Inorder to receive a refund, end-users need not submit any further evidenceof injury beyond volumes of product purchased in the distribution schemein which the overcharges occurred. See A. Terricone, 15 DOE andpara; 85,495at 88,893-96 (1987). Reseller and retailer claimants must submit detailedevidence of injury, and may not rely on the presumptions of injury utilizedin refund cases involving refined petroleum products. Id. They can, however,use econometric evidence of the type employed in the OHA Report to theDistrict Court in the Stripper Well Litigation, 6 Fed. Energy Guidelinesandpara; 90,507 (June 19, 1985). Applicants who executed and submitted avalid waiver pursuant to one of the escrows established in the SettlementAgreement have waived their rights to apply for crude oil refunds underSubpart V. Boise Cascade Corp., 16 DOE andpara; 85,214 at 88,411 (1987);Sea-Land Service, Inc., 16 DOE andpara; 85,496 at 88,991 n.1 (1987). Refunds to eligible claimants who purchased refined petroleum productswill be calculated on the basis of a volumetric refund amount derived bydividing the crude oil violation amounts involved in this determination($7.2 million) by the total consumption of petroleum products in the UnitedStates during the period of price controls (2,020,997,335,000 gallons).Mountain Fuel, 14 DOE at 88,868. This yields a volumetric refund amountof $0.00000356 per gallon. We propose to adopt a deadline of October 31,1989, for refund applications submitted pursuant to this Decision. SeeWorld Oil Corp., 17 DOE andpara; <T2>XXX</T2>, No. KEF-0005 (July 7, 1988).As we stated in previous Decisions, a crude oil refund applicant will berequired to submit only one application for crude oil overcharge funds.See Allerkamp, 17 DOE at 88,176. Any party that has previously submitteda refund application in crude oil refund proceedings need not file anotherapplication. A deadline of June 30, 1988, was established for all crudeoil refund proceedings implemented pursuant to the MSRP up to and includingShell Oil. See A. Tarricone, Inc., 16 DOE andpara; 85,681 (1987); Allerkamp,17 DOE at 88,178; Shell Oil, 17 DOE at 88,408. Any applicant that filesa refund application after that deadline will be eligible to receive arefund based only on the volumetric amounts approved subsequent to thatdate. This volumetric refund amount will be increased as additional crudeoil violation amounts are received in the future. Applicants may be requiredto submit additional information to document their refund claims for thesefuture amounts. Notice of any additional amounts available in the futurewill be published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.B. Payments to the States and Federal GovernmentUnder the terms of the MSRP, we propose that the remaining 80 percent ofthe alleged crude oil violation amounts subject to this Proposed Decision,or $5.76 million, plus interest, be disbursed in equal shares to the statesand federal government for indirect restitution. Refunds to the stateswill be in proportion to the consumption of petroleum products in eachstate during the period of price controls. The share or ratio of the fundswhich each state will receive is contained in Exhibit H of the SettlementAgreement. These funds will be subject to the same limitations and reportingrequirements as all other crude oil monies received by the states underthe Settlement Agreement.Before taking the actions we have proposed in this Decision, we intendto publicize our proposal and solicit comments on it. Comments regardingthe tentative distribution process set forth in this Proposed Decisionand Order should be filed with the OHA within 30 days of its publicationin the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.It Is Therefore Ordered That:The refund amounts remitted to the Department of Energy by New York Petroleum,Inc., Chevron U.S.A. Inc., Patton Oil Company and Ladd Petroleum Corporationshall be distributed in accordance with the foregoing Decision.<ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 88-17492 Filed 8-2-88; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6450-01-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
