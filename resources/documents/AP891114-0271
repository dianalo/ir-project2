SEC Chairman Richard C. Breeden told the House Banking Committeethat a ``memorandum of understanding'' between the Federal HomeLoan Bank Board and Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, Irvine,Calif., gave Lincoln's parent company a powerful legal tool toresist the SEC's probe.   The SEC was trying to determine if the parent company, AmericanContinental Corp., headed by Phoenix, Ariz., millionaire Charles H.Keating Jr., had filed false financial statements.   However, Breeden said, the May 20, 1988, memorandum ofunderstanding ``said in essence that the financial statements wereall right'' and allowed American Continental to argue that theSEC's investigation should be dropped.   American Continental continued to sell its subordinated debt,which has proved to be worthless, through Lincoln's 29 branchesuntil early this year, witnesses told the House panel, in the fifthof six scheduled hearings on Lincoln's collapse.   Karl Hoyle, a spokesman for the bank board, now called theOffice of Thrift Supervision, said the memorandum ``in no way couldhave impeded'' the SEC investigation. ``They're independent. ...There's nothing we can do to get in the way,'' he said.   In sometimes tearful testimony, victims of the failure,including a partially blind widow and the mother of a brain-damageddaughter, said in large part they blamed Sen. Alan Cranston,D-Calif., for their plight.   Cranston and four other senators are under fire for acceptinglarge political contributions from Keating before meeting on hisbehalf with Sandamp;L regulators in April 1987.   ``I had no idea this man could be so corrupted,'' said ShirleyLampel, a Tustin, Calif., widow, who testified that an AmericanContinental employee eagerly offered to drive her to Lincoln so shecould invest her life savings, $30,000, in the holding company'ssubordinated debt, which is repayable only after other debts aresatisfied.   Because she could not see well enough to read the prospectus orthe agreement she signed, Mrs. Lampel said the employee summarizedit for her, but did not mention any risk or loss.   Mrs. Lampel and most of the 23,000 other Lincoln customers whopurchased $250 million in subordinated debt said they thought theywere purchasing the equivalent of a federally insured certificateof deposit.   Another victim, Ramona E. Jacobs of Glendale, Calif., saidAmerican Continental employees assured her the $11,000 insubordinated debt she purchased was ``secured.'' The money includedpart of an insurance settlement paid after an automobile accidentleft her 23-year-old daughter brain damaged.   Murray Flander, a spokesman for Cranston, said, ``We havenothing but compassion for these people.''   ``Cranston ... didn't know there had been a bond sale until heread about it newspapers after Lincoln was closed down,'' Flandersaid.   Breeden told the committee that the SEC did not have enoughevidence by the spring of 1988 t stop American Continental fromissuing the subordinated debt, but is now reexamining its policiesand the law to see if changes are needed.   He said he has doubled the number of staff members assigned toinvestigate Lincoln. Matters related to the investigation havealready been presented to a federal grand jury in Los Angeles, hesaid, confirming newspaper reports.   In next week's Lincoln hearing, Keating and M. Danny Wall, headof the Office of Thrift Supervision, are scheduled to testify.   After that, Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of thecommittee, said he intended to investigate Sandamp;L scandals ``beyondLincoln.'' Later, he told a reporter the probe would include thefailure of Silverado Savings in Colorado, on whose board Neal Bush,the president's son, once served.   In another development, Senate Banking Committee Chairman DonaldW. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., who has played down his connection toKeating, toured Phoenix real estate projects funded by Lincoln, atrade publication said Tuesday.   The previously undisclosed visit in March 1987 included ahelicopter trip to the Phoenician Hotel, a lavish resort then underconstruction by Keating, and a visit to American Continental, wherethe senator gave a speech to employees, the American Bankerreported.   The visit occured around the time that Keating was lobbyingvigorously for relief from regulations that limited Sandamp;Ls' directinvestment in real estate and other speculative commercial ventures.   Karolyn Wallace, a spokeswoman for Riegle, said the senator madethe visit because American Continental owned a hotel and otherproperty in downtown Detroit and ``he considered them an importantMichigan business constituent.''</TEXT></DOC>
