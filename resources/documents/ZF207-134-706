LyonsandM;Open Look, Open Token, Open Software, Open Desktop, Open Fonts -- everybody'stalking about a brave new open world where all computers work together andshare data.andM;But before you start thinking anybody really means it, talk to Mitch Kapor.andM;Seventeen months ago, Kapor, the legendary founder of Lotus DevelopmentCorp., hired some of the best minds in the business and started a newcompany, ON Technology Inc.andM;The company's mission was to build a systems-software platform that would runacross all environments -- a boon for users but a threat to computer makerswho want to keep their systems unique.andM;Last week, Kapor revealed he had laid off his systems-software wizards anddropped the platform project, even though he maintains it's still technicallyfeasible.andP;  The reason: To make the ON platform a success, the company needsalliances with major industry players -- and they won't play ball, Kaporsaid.andM;''Maybe what we were doing was a bit too idealistic,'' Kapor said.andP;  ''Ourdoing this revealed some underlying tension, with people wanting to innovatebut also hold onto what they have.andP;  We ran into a brick wall.''andM;Kapor said he needed help from IBM, Microsoft Corp., Apple Computer Inc. andSun Microsystems Inc., among others.andP;  He wouldn't say who didn't cooperate.andM;Kapor's defeat in part reflects the unwillingness of computer companies tomake good on their ''open systems'' promises, observers said.andM;''Open systems is just another marketing ploy,'' said Richard Shaffer, editorand publisher of the Technologic Computer Letter, an industry publicationbased in New York.andP;  ''It's just so much press-release blather.''andM;The breakdown of the platform project wasn't caused just by the lack ofcooperation from other companies.andM;The ON team found the technical hurdle to be higher than it had originallyexpected, ON President Peter Miller said.andM;''Building a 'universal layer' turned out to be a very high-risk thing,''Miller said.andP;  ''It can be done, but it would take longer than we wanted towait for our first products.''andM;Developing a layer of software that could work unchanged with both MotorolaInc. and Intel Corp. architectures proved difficult, Miller said.andP;  Althoughthe company has been secretive about the platform project, the layer wasexpected to reside on top of available operating systems, with links tovarious processors.andM;Developers would only have to write to the ON platform to achieveinteroperability for their software.andM;The project would have required more time and money than administrators felta startup could handle, Miller said.andP;  Kapor has put about $1 million of hisown money into ON, and venture capitalists have invested another $3 million.andM;Another reason for scrapping the project was competition from other operatingenvironments, especially new ones such as NeXT Inc.'s Mach operating system,a variant of Unix.andM;''What Mitch discovered was that the last thing the world needed was anotheroperating system or anything that even smells like one,'' said Shaffer.andM;The setback has not killed ON Technology, but it has forced Kapor to shiftthe company's focus to applications, a more modest goal.andM;There are now 22 employees working at ON's Cambridge, Mass., offices.andP;  But 10of the big-name industry veterans have left ON, including Stonewall Ballard,a specialist in object-oriented programming lured from Xerox Corp.; JamesHamilton, one of the founders of Apollo Computer Inc.; Kincade Webb, a formerengineer at Apollo; and Don Gilmore, a database specialist.andM;Miller and Kapor said ON applications, which are due on the Macintoshplatform in 1990, will stick to the company's original philosophy of creatingsoftware that makes computers work in a manner more compatible with the wayhuman beings think.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
