In the civil suit, brought by the Securities and ExchangeCommission, the jury found that Brian Callahan, formerly astockbroker with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., andWilliam Jackson, who worked at the Torrance, Calif., printingplant of R.R. Donnelly andamp; Sons Co., broke the law by tradingon confidential information.</LP><TEXT>   The SEC charged that Mr. Jackson traded on informationfrom Business Week before the magazine hit the newsstands andthen passed the information on to Mr. Callahan. Employees ofDonnelly, one of the companies that prints Business Week forMcGraw-Hill Inc., have been named in other SEC lawsuitsalleging that they used advance information from themagazine. Donnelly requires its employees to keep suchinformation secret.   Mr. Callahan and Mr. Jackson were accused of making atotal of 122 transactions involving 53 stocks between July1987 and July 1988. Mr. Callahan joined the scheme in April1988 when Mr. Jackson opened an account with him, the SECsaid.   U.S. Judge Stephen V. Wilson issued a freeze on the amountof the defendants' assets that the SEC is seeking to haveturned over as illegal profits. The SEC said the $19,500freeze on Mr. Jackson's assets represents illegal profitsmade on the transactions in Mr. Jackson's own accounts, thoseof a brother and a joint account he had with two brothers.The brothers weren't accused of any wrongdoing.   The $27,600 freeze on Mr. Callahan's assets equals theillegal profits that he and eight clients made on thetransactions, plus $8,000 in brokerage commissions, saidJeffrey Zuckerman, an SEC associate regional administratorfrom New York working on the case. The SEC has said Mr.Callahan was fired by Prudential-Bache in August 1988 for hisalleged involvement in the scheme.   The two defendants also face penalties of as much as threetimes the illegal profits. Judge Wilson will decide whetherto order any penalties.   Attorneys for the defendants said Mr. Callahan's and Mr.Jackson's stock trading violated no securities law. JosephConnolly, an attorney for Mr. Callahan, said his clientdidn't know the information he received from Mr. Jackson wasconfidential. Jack Samet, an attorney for Mr. Jackson, saidhe doesn't believe the violation of a work rule shouldconstitute a securities-law violation.   The defense attorneys have filed a motion asking JudgeWilson to reject the SEC's use of the &quot;misappropriationtheory&quot; in this case. Under that theory, the SEC chargessecurities fraud if a defendant trades on confidentialinformation that was taken in violation of a fiduciary duty.The defense attorneys plan to appeal if their motion isdenied.   Although that SEC rule has been upheld in other federaljurisdictions, including New York, it hasn't been decided inthe Los Angeles court.</TEXT></DOC>
