Government officialsand the Kansai Electric Power Co., which owns the plant, said no radiationescaped from the plant itself, and no one was injured.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Front  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  NUCLEAR ACCIDENT MAY SHAKE JAPANINCIDENT THREATENS PLANS FOR REACTORS  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     But Japanese newspapers and outside experts said that the accident was theworst since Japan began operating nuclear power plants two decades ago. If anemergency cooling system had not worked properly, they said, the result couldhave been very similar to the kind of damage that took place at Three MileIsland in Pennsylvania in 1979.;    For the Japanese government the biggestdamage from the accident may be political.;    In recent months, thegovernment has made a renewed effort to win support for the construction ofmany more nuclear power plants, hoping that the Persian Gulf war wouldunderscore the need to make Japan less dependent on imported oil. But suchefforts have largely failed. While the government has said that it wantsnuclear power to account for 36 percent of Japan's electricity needs by 1995,up from 25.5 percent last year, growing opposition makes that goal unlikely.;   &quot;This could be a major setback,&quot; an official of the Ministry ofInternational Trade and Industry, who asked not to be named, said Sunday. &quot;Wedon't know yet.&quot;;    The anti-nuclear movement has already delayed more than adozen projects, including the opening of Japan's first installation toreprocess uranium.;    Reports about the scope and details of Saturday'saccident are still sketchy, and government officials say it may be a month ormore before they fully understand what happened. The reactor, one of three ina small town called Mihama, 220 miles west of Tokyo, will be inoperable for atleast several months.;    The reactor is part of the No. 2 Power Plant atMihama, a pressurized water reactor that began operation in 1972.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  DAVID E.
