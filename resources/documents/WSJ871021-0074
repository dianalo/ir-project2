Executives who watched the value of their companies plunge in Monday's stock-market rout saw something even closer to home plunge too: their personal fortunes. Stock options that produced huge paper gains in a bull market are suddenly a lot less valuable.    &quot;These guys have lost a big piece of their estate-building opportunity, that's obvious,&quot; says Louis J. Brindisi Jr., chairman of Management Compensation Group, an executive compensation consulting company. &quot;They've lost literally hundreds of thousands of dollars.&quot;    The market's decline and the accompanying personal paper losses may make companies and executives more leery of stock options. Executive-compensation specialists say they expect companies to dole out fewer stock options than they did in the market's go-go past, favoring more plans that pay off in cash.    But many compensation specialists also say that a market drop -- if it had to occur -- couldn't have come at a better time for compensation plans and the executives they benefit. That's because many Fortune 500 companies are just putting their stock option plans in place for next year. Stock options are the right to buy stock at a certain price some time in the future; that price is usually set at the price of the stock on the day the options are granted. Assuming that stock prices are possibly close to a nadir -- admittedly a big assumption -- executives will be in line for more gains should the market rebound.    &quot;They lost it on one end, but they'll be getting some of it back through additional grants at a lower level,&quot; says Management Compensation Group's Mr. Brindisi. Adds David Swinford, head of consultants Towers Perrin's executive-compensation practice: &quot;In the short term, executives may be thinking 'Wouldn't this be a good time to grant options?'&quot;    In this latest market drop, unless an executive converted options to stock and sold the shares following the market's decline, the losses are all on paper. But some of the paper losses have been nearly as spectacular as the paper profits were. For example, Walt Disney Co.'s chairman, Michael Eisner, had a paper loss Monday of $37.8 million.    Assuming he hadn't earlier converted options and sold the stock, Mr. Eisner holds options to buy two million shares at $14.36 over a six-year period ending in 1990. Disney stock dropped $18.875 on Monday to close at $46 and Mr. Eisner's options dropped in value to $63.3 million from $101.1 million.    Over the past several weeks his paper loss has been even greater. When Walt Disney stock hit a high of $82.50 on Aug. 25, his options were valued at $136.3 million. Mr. Eisner couldn't be reached, and the company declined to comment on his stock options.    As the market rose over the past few years, stock options became more and more important to executive-compensation packages. &quot;Basically people have come to think that options and long-term incentives are a critical, big element in compensation,&quot; says David J. McLaughlin, managing principal of compensation consultants Sibson andamp; Co. &quot;That's quite different than it used to be 15 years ago, when it was viewed as just a ticket to play.&quot;    In 1981, stock-option programs were worth 57% of salary, a survey by Management Compensation Group showed. By 1986, they were worth 140% of salary. In 1986, Mr. Brindisi says, the average stock-option grant to the chief executive of a Fortune 200 company executive was $1 million.    And stock options delivered more than just paper profits. Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee Iacocca's $20.6 million 1986 compensation largely reflected stock options granted in 1980 when the chairman of the then-struggling auto maker took a lot of stock options in lieu of a fat salary.    But following the stock-market decline, many stock-option plans are not only less valuable, they have no value at all. Executive-compensation specialists say that many options granted within the past year or two are now &quot;under water.&quot; That is, the exercise price of the option is below the stock's market price.    Compensation specialists say that since most stock options are granted for exercise over periods of 10 years or longer, some companies may choose simply to wait out the bear market. Others, however, may decide to bail their executives out by canceling their options and reissuing them at lower prices.    However, the specialists believe few companies will do that, since the move is so controversial. Since shareholders don't have the same possibility of erasing their stock-market losses, boards now perceive such moves as unfairly favoring senior executives.    Not every executive was caught in the market's downturn. In fact, it appears likely that the earlier soaring market tempted many executives to cash in big options long before the market fell.    &quot;My impression is that there's been a large number of people exercising,&quot; says Charles Peck, a compensation specialist with the Conference Board. Thus, next year's crop of proxy statements is likely to reveal big stock-options gains as impressive as this year's -- or more so.    ---                      Widespread Options   Percentage of companies with stock-options plans, byindustry    Diversified service                             100%    Manufacturuing                                   82%    Retail trade                                     73%    Commercial banking                               61%    Construction                                     56%    Insurance                                        45%    Gas and electric utilities                       24%   Source: The Conference Board</TEXT></DOC>
