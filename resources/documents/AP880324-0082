Republican Bob Dole criticized Democrat Michael Dukakis, andDemocrats Albert Gore Jr. and Jesse Jackson attacked GOPfront-runner George Bush in a preview of what the fall campaignmight bring.   Gephardt insisted publicly that no decisions had been made, butan aide said the Missouri congressman would leave the presidentialrace early next week in time to file for re-election to his Houseseat by the Tuesday deadline.   ``He will be out if he doesn't win in Michigan,'' said the aide,who spoke on the condition of anonymity.   Gephardt is running third in the polls in Michigan behindDukakis and Jackson.   Although the primary season is far from over, the candidatesappeared to be shifting their attention toward the general-electionconfrontation in November between their two parties. AfterMichigan, both parties hold primaries in Connecticut on Tuesday.   Heading into this round of contests, the Democrats have largelyavoided the bitter battles among themselves that were typical ofthe Super Tuesday campaign earlier this month. But there's stillsome infighting afoot.   Gephardt has sounded a drumbeat of attacks against Dukakis inrecent days, accusing him of inconsistency on trade issues. He wasexpected to bring up the subject again today in an economic address.   In Michigan, the Missouri congressman has been courting workers,especially those in the auto industry, with hisget-tough-on-foreigners trade message.   Gore, without mentioning Gephardt by name, took a swipe at himfor that. ``It would be easy to blame all our problems onforeigners,'' he told the Wisconsin Legislature.   The Tennessee senator is badly in need of a Northern victory,and his political director, Larry Harrington, said Wisconsin may bethe place for Gore to ``punch through.''   Also making a big push in Wisconsin is Sen. Paul Simon, whosehome-state victory in Illinois last week revived his bid.   ``If I can win Wisconsin, two weeks later is New York. ... Thatwould give me a lift and put me back in the ball game in a majorway,'' Simon told the Green Bay Press-Gazette.   Jackson was crisscrossing Michigan, where polls have indicatedhe is running second to Dukakis. Other candidates may have moremoney, Jackson told auto workers, but he has a richer message.   ``I've been ... walking the assembly line, standing with andfighting for the workers,'' he said. ``I don't have the big engine,but I know the roads a lot better.''   That was about the closest Jackson came to criticizing hisDemocratic opponents. Instead, he took the vice president to task,vowing to ``keep on challenging him on the leadership gap.''   Gore, too, delivered a forceful attack on Bush, saying the vicepresident ``wants another chance to cut taxes for the rich.'' Healso questioned Bush's role in the Iran-Contra affair.   ``It's not as if he were a neophyte sitting in the White Housewith no basis of judgment on the arms-for-hostages swap,'' Goresaid of Bush.   In a CBS-New York Times poll, 51 percent said yes when asked ifBush was hiding something the public ought to know about theIran-Contra affair; 28 percent said no and 21 percent said theydidn't know. The margin of error was 3 points, CBS said Wednesdaynight.   Bush got kinder treatment at the hands of Dole, now a rival inname only. Bush holds an overwhelming lead in delegates, and theKansas senator has abandoned his once-bitter attacks on the vicepresident.   Dole, in a Washington speech on Wednesday, accused theDemocratic contenders of a ``failure of nerve as well as a failureof vision'' in dealing with Nicaragua's leftist Sandinistagovernment.   The Kansas senator singled out Dukakis for the sharpestcriticism, saying: ``He says that this country ... has no choicebut to tolerate the existence of Soviet client states whereversubversion might install them.''   Dukakis spokesman Leslie Dach retorted: ``I guess Bob Dole istaking after Michael Dukakis because he's accomplishing what BobDole can't _ beating George Bush in the polls.''   A poll published Wednesday by the Hartford Courant suggestedBush was favored by 64 percent of likely GOP voters in Connecticut,while Dole was the choice of just 20 percent. Dole, campaigning inConnecticut, brushed that off.   ``I don't pay any attention to polls. They said I was going towin in New Hampshire,'' he said.   Bush, whose father was a U.S. senator from Connecticut, furtherconsolidated his strength in the state with the endorsement of GOPstate chairman Robert S. Poliner.   Dukakis, was raising money in California today, with a newendorsement of his own to point to: the popular Sen. Bill Bradleyof New Jersey. The New Jersey senator, who is sometimes faulted fora less-than-dynamic speaking style, used the occasion to poke alittle fun at both himself and Dukakis.   ``It has been said of Michael Dukakis that he is dull, a chargewith which I am not unfamiliar,'' Bradley said Wednesday. ``Butgovernance is not an amusement park.''</TEXT></DOC>
