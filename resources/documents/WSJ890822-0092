Then, on June 4, the tanks rolled into Beijing to crush the democracy movement. Mr. Wan, whose Stone Group had helped bankroll the movement, fled to the West, escaping certain arrest. Today, the 43-year-old businessman has taken on his toughest challenge: leading the oppositionin-exile to China's Communist Party.    As secretary-general of the newly formed Front for Democratic China, Mr. Wan heads a loose coalition of exiled students, intellectuals and businessmen that he contends will eventually help force a transition to a democratic government in China.    &quot;Within six years,&quot; the brash computer whiz-kid promises, &quot;the Li Peng regime will fall.&quot; When that happens, the Front hopes to return to Beijing to compete in free elections against the Communists. &quot;If the people don't want to vote for us, that's fine, but they must be given a choice,&quot; he says.    It's a long shot, at best. The Front, provisionally set up in Paris last month, still lacks an office. Its headquarters in New York City consists only of a staffer's home telephone number. Moreover, the Front is likely to have trouble attracting funding and publicity as world attention begins to shift away from China.    So Mr. Wan is eager to find help, from any source. To finance dissident activities, the group is even accepting money from the Taiwan government, a source normally shunned by Chinese exiles because of Taipei's rivalry with Beijing. For tactical advice, Mr. Wan is meeting with members of Solidarity, the Polish trade movement that now shares power with the Polish Communist Party. Mr. Wan sees important parallels between the two countries.    &quot;The Communists couldn't solve Poland's economic problems, so they needed to bring in Solidarity,&quot; he says. &quot;In China, too, the conservative leaders can't overcome our economic difficulties. They will need our help.&quot;    Mr. Wan is constantly on the go, flitting back and forth between the U.S. and Europe, trying to drum up cash and support. During a two-day stop in New York, he met with journalists at his hotel.    Mr. Wan seems uncomfortable in his new role, often preferring to talk of the business he left behind. He still considers himself the Stone Group's president, although China said last week he had been removed from the post. He left China with millions of dollars, apparently profits from Stone, of which he owns 50%. Mr. Wan also is shopping for investment ideas. He plans to put an initial $1 million in a French venture and is seeking a financial adviser &quot;who doesn't charge too much.&quot;    Besides Mr. Wan, the Chinese opposition movement has two other leaders. One is Yan Jiaqi, a former adviser to ousted Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang. Mr. Yan fled China just after the June 4 massacre. The other is Wuerkaixi, the charismatic 21-year-old student leader who won notoriety for berating China's premier, Li Peng, in a televised meeting. He, too, escaped just after the killings and plans to attend Harvard University in the fall.    Mr. Yan, a political strategist, comes across as a dry academic. And Mr. Wuerkaixi is becoming something of a liability to the movement, frequently making unprovable claims about what happened in Beijing on June 4. That leaves Mr. Wan as the most qualified organizer and communicator for the opposition group.    It will be economic, not political, problems that eventually bring down the current regime, Mr. Wan says. Economic changes, brought about during a decade of reform, already have provoked instability by creating inflation and disparities in wealth. Since June 4, Mr. Wan says, hardline leaders have reasserted control of the economy. &quot;Reforms are dead,&quot; he says, adding that the new leaders have no alternative plan to bolster the economy.    &quot;Serious economic stagnation will inflame resistance among the people,&quot; Mr. Wan says. &quot;That will exacerbate the internal power struggle within the Politburo&quot; and create opportunities for liberalization, perhaps opening the door for the exiled Front to participate in Beijing politics.    Even without a Solidarity-like rival, the Chinese Communists have seen their power diluted in recent years. Entrepreneurs such as Mr. Wan, who aren't beholden to the party, have amassed the money and influence to sometimes challenge the party. During the democracy movement in Beijing, for example, Stone funneled $25,000 to protesting students and donated electronic equipment for their broadcasting center on Tiananmen Square.    Now overseas, Mr. Wan is wrestling with how to remain relevant to the Chinese situation. For now, the Front's goals seem overly broad. The main tasks are to end dictatorship, promote human rights, reconstruct the Chinese republic and create a federal system. Mr. Wan concedes there are disagreements on aspirations and tactics among overseas Chinese, who have long been plagued by intense factionalism. But the Front is taking some concrete steps. Hu Ming, a former student who Mr. Wan persuaded to take over the Front's New York office, is setting up the Voice of Chinese Students, a radio station that &quot;will broadcast the truth about what is happening in China to the Chinese.&quot; The station will be based in Australia but the Taiwan government will provide funding, paying for a cable link from Australia and for the costs of broadcasting to the mainland. </TEXT></DOC>
