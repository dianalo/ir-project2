<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-77-0496 </DOCNO><TEXT>Using a formulation of quantum electrodynamics which is not second quantized,but rather based on self-fields, we calculate the energy shifts of anelectron bound by a magnetic field in the vicinity of an infinite-planeconductor. We confirm the recent result of Kreuzer that the energy shiftarising from the plate-induced change in the magnetic moment, {Delta}{mu}/{mu}= -{alpha}/4Rm, is exactly canceled by a similar change {Delta}m/m =-{alpha}/4Rm in the mass. Thus no change occurs in the spin-precessionfrequency to order {alpha}/Rm, in agreement with Brown et al. This cancellationof the two effects resolves an apparent controversy in recent literatureover whether such a shift to the spin-precession frequency {omega}/subs/ occurs. There is, however, a boundary-induced change in the cyclotronfrequency {omega}/sub c/ which we calculate in the quantum result as{Delta}{omega}/sub c//{omega}/sub c/ = {alpha}/8Rm to order {alpha}.Our method of approach is novel in that it uses only the self-field tocompute radiative corrections; there are no vacuum fluctuations.</TEXT></DOC>
