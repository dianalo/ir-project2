But any production trimming by OPEC now is expected to be too late to prevent world prices of oil, currently $14 to $19 a barrel, from weakening further before rebounding late this year after seasonal increases in petroleum demand.    &quot;Prices will ease a bit and then firm up in the fourth quarter,&quot; said Peter Gignoux, manager of the Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. international energy desk in London.    Still, industry and OPEC officials generally agreed that chances are rapidly fading for the type of free-for-all production war that raised the specter of $5 a barrel oil last year. &quot;It doesn't look like a repeat of last fall,&quot; said a senior OPEC official.    These developments are a result largely of the production actions -- and perceived plans -- of two major members of OPEC. The two members, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, were leaders of opposing factions at the acrimonious June OPEC meeting.    The outcome of the June meeting was a second-half production ceiling of 19.5 million barrels a day for all 13 members. Kuwait refused, however, to accept its quota of 1.1 million barrels a day and has been producing as much as 1.8 million barrels since. Also, most other OPEC members with spare output capacity are exceeding their quotas.    The result since June has been a surge of nearly one million barrels a day in production, putting current output close to 22 million barrels a day. Although that is in line with OPEC's forecast of demand for its oil in the fourth quarter, it is well ahead of most projections for the third quarter. And it is within one million barrels of the 1988 peak of some 23 million barrels a day.    But Saudi Arabia has remained aloof from this summer's pumping race. It has stuck relatively near its second-half quota of nearly 4.8 million barrels a day.    This is a surprise to many because last year the OPEC kingpin was quick to retaliate against production excesses by others by opening its own valves. The kingdom, in fact, led the output expansion in last year's second half by stepping up its own output to some seven million barrels a day at one point.    Many OPEC watchers maintain that the Saudis have little choice except to resume the unwanted role of swing producer at the moment, holding down their own output even though others have increased production. That is partly because Kuwait, which has a large refining and marketing network abroad, would prefer lower crude oil prices and thus wouldn't be hurt by a big jump in Saudi output.    &quot;For the Saudis, opening the valves would be a lose-lose situation,&quot; said a Houston-based oil consultant.    Even as it becomes unlikely that the Saudis will make any significant changes in their production schedules, for the moment at least, Sheik Ali Khalifa Al-Sabah, Kuwait's oil minister, is reaffirming plans to cut Kuwaiti output. This week, before meeting with Hisham Nazer, his Saudi counterpart, Sheik Ali announced that he is reducing production to the level he had previously promised -- 1,350,000 barrels a day.    There is skepticism among monitors of OPEC output as to the depths of the cuts the Kuwaiti oil minister will make. But most agreed that Kuwait's oil production should drop. Sheik Ali &quot;has shown the stick; now he will want to use the carrot,&quot; said Bahman Karbassioun, a Vienna, Austria-based consultant on OPEC affairs. </TEXT></DOC>
