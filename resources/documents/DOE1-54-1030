The total cross section for photoproductionof hadrons has been measured in Be and C nuclei in the photon energyregion E/sub {gamma}/ = 0.2--0.85 GeV. The results, normalized per nucleon,agree within experimental error for C and Be and in the energy regionof the second resonance show the presence of a peak. We have also measuredthe total cross section for photoproduction of {pi}{sup 0} mesons withoutcharged particles in the final state and the total cross section forphotoproduction of {pi}{sup 0}p for determination of the total crosssection for coherent photoproduction of {pi}{sup 0} mesons. It is foundthat the total cross section for coherent photoproduction of neutralpions decreases strongly for E/sub {gamma}/{ge}400 MeV, approaching zero,which is in good agreement with the predictions of resonance models.</TEXT></DOC>
