The measure is aimed at completing the EC'ssingle market in banking, and protecting banks fromoverextending themselves.   The so-called large exposures directive would preventbanks from lending more than 25% of their equity to one partyor group. Banks would have to report to national regulatorsany loan exceeding 10% of equity. The 25% limit had beenopposed as too low by several EC countries, including Franceand Italy, but ministers agreed to make the measure effectivein phases over eight years beginning in 1994.   The officials backed a compromise under which bank loansor credit lines after 1994 to individuals would be limited to40% of equity. After 1999, new loans would be kept at 25%,though loans outstanding at as much as 40% of equity couldrun three more years. Less-restrictive rules would apply tointerbank lending.   The legislation would bring the EC in line with rules inthe U.S. and Japan.                                                                                                          CHINA TO DROP AN IMPORT LEVY                                                                                                          China will eliminate on April 1 a special import duty on18 products, imposed in 1985 to aid local manufacturers. Theordinary tax on imported goods isn't affected; thus, thetotal levy will fall to 61.5% from 90.1% on most of the goodssubject to the special duty, including cars, video cameras,synthetic fiber, computers, integrated circuits andtelevision projectors. Washington has increasingly pressuredBeijing to ease trade barriers. The U.S. Senate may vote thisweek on overriding President Bush's veto of a bill to placeharsher conditions on renewing China's favored trade status.                                                                                                          FRANCE UNVEILS SAVINGS PLAN                                                                                                          French Economics Minister Pierre Beregovoy has proposed anequities savings plan calling for tax benefits on accountsheld at least eight years. The proposal is intended to helpboost investments in stocks in Paris and other Frenchmarkets. Mr. Beregovoy told a French newspaper his plan,which he will seek to present to the National Assembly in thespring, would allow tax-free capital gains. Withdrawals fromthe accounts after eight years would be unrestricted.                                                                                                          JAPAN, U.S. COOPERATE ON LOANS                                                                                                          Japan and the U.S. unveiled $1 billion of cooperativefinancing for five projects in developing countries, aimed atboosting their imports. The development projects inIndonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, Chile and Venezuelaresulted from an agreement signed last May and expandedduring President Bush's visit to Japan in January. Thecofinanced projects, primarily in the power sector, are tohelp spur local economic growth and are expected to result inimpports of about $430 million from the U.S. and $270 millionfrom Japan, mainly building supplies and equipment.                                                                                                          GREECE OFFERS CLEAN-AIR CARROT                                                                                                          In an attempt to curb chronic air pollution in Athens,Greece proposed legislation with incentives for use ofvehicles that produce fewer emissions. Some taxes would bereduced as much as 65% for replacing older vehicles,including taxis, with those that have catalytic converters,allowing use of lead-free gasoline. The newer vehicles alsowould be exempt from license-plate taxes and road-use feesfor five years. Of the estimated 1.5 million motor vehiclesin the mountain-ringed Greek capital, only about 300,000 havecatalytic converters.                                                                                                          SOUTH KOREA'S CAPITAL ATTRACTION                                                                                                          Foreign investment in South Korea amounted to 41 projectsin this year's first two months, off 16% from a year earlier,but their total value soared 94% to $230 million. Of that,the manufacturing sector accounted for $189 million, morethan double the year-earlier sum, and the service sector $41million, up 40%. The U.S. topped the investor list with $100million, triple that of a year earlier, while investmentsfrom Japan fell 21% to $55 million.                                                                                                          MANILA CLEARS TRADE ZONE                                                                                                          Philippine President Corazon Aquino signed into law ameasure designating Subic Naval Base and adjacent areas aduty-free zone. But she rejected rules on appointingofficials to run the zone.   The conversion legislation requires that the firstadministrator of the new Subic Metropolitan Authority be themayor of adjacent Olongapo City. This, Mrs. Aquino maintains,violates a constitutional ban on elected officialssimultaneously holding executive appointments. She alsodeemed unconstitutional the rule that her nominees for zonepositions be confirmed by the government appointmentscommission.   Mrs. Aquino said she would appoint officials to head thezone after the law goes into effect early next month.   Companies interested in leasing parts of the base complainthat confusion about who is in charge of the zone, which willbe larger than Singapore, has made it difficult to proceedwith their business proposals.
