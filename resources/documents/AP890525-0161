Pierce said he did not suspend the program, as recommended bythe auditors, because he believed changes to the program hadalleviated many of its problems.   The Department of Housing and Urban Development program providedindirect subsidies for rehabilitation of privately owned low-incomehousing projects. Jack Kemp, the current housing secretary, lastmonth suspended awards under the program, pending further review.   The HUD inspector general said his audit found a pattern duringthe Reagan administration in which former department officials andother Republicans received a large share of project awards eitheras developers or as consultants to developers.   Among those cited by the inspector general's report was formerInterior Secretary James Watt, who was reported receiving a$300,000 consulting fee on a Maryland project.   Pierce drew an angry response from Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass.,when he told a House Government Operations subcommittee that theauditor's report focused on Republicans and that he would like tosee ``how those affliated with the Democratic Party benefited fromthis program.''   ``I think what you were trying to do was deflect some of theblame ... making irresponsible statements that you can't back up,''said Frank.   It was Pierce's first public response to the inspector general'sreport, which claimed the program was riddled with ``favoritism''and ``mismanagement.''   Pierce, Reagan's sole black Cabinet member who remained at HUDthroughout the eight years of the administration, denied thatprojects pushed by well-connected Republicans got any greaterconsideration than others.   Pierce said he had one meeting with Watt but ``no promises weremade to him.''   He said he would have advised housing authorities and developerswho hired consultants that they were wasting their money.   ``There are other ways of getting to the people at HUD,'' Piercesaid without elaborating.   Pierce defended his decision not to carryout the inspectorgeneral's recommendation to suspend the program awards.   ``I did not cavalierly disregard it (the IG's recommendation),''he said.   ``The IG is not God,'' he added, defending his decision to givea 3-member selection committee full discretion in selecting whichprojects would be funded.   The former housing secretary admitted he had final authorityover the committee's decisions although he ``automatically approvedevery project selection made by the panel'' since he received nocomplaints about the process.   Rep. Bruce Morrison, D-Conn., reminded Pierce that Congress hadordered HUD to considered funding requests from ``public housingauthorities'' not specific ``projects'' or ``developers.''</TEXT></DOC>
