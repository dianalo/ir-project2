The letter was sent from Damascus, Syria, where Mrs. Say isvisiting. It was hoped Beirut newspapers would get it to Anderson'scaptors by publishing it on her birthday Wednesday.   ``My heart feels very close to you on this day,'' Mrs. Say wrote.``I came to celebrate my 48th birthday by being close to you andpraying for your strength and freedom. I will go home much older,much sadder and much wiser than when I began this journey four yearsago.''   Anderson, 41, chief Middle East correspondent of The AssociatedPress, was abducted in west Beirut and Islamic Jihad, believed to bemade up of Shiite Moslem zealots loyal to Iran, claimedresponsibility. He and eight other Americans are among 15 foreignhostages held in Lebanon.   Mrs. Say flew to Damascus on Monday to meet with Syrian officialswho have cooperated with efforts to obtain the release of hostages.   In her letter, she said she thanked to President Hafez Assad andSheik Mohammed Hussein Fadalallah, spiritual guide of the LebaneseShiite group Hezbollah, believed to be an umbrella organization forthose holding hostages.   ``I have sent messages of gratitude to Sheik Fadlallah andPresident Assad for their intense and complicated efforts to freethe hostages,'' the letter said. ``Our country and others areworking very hard to bring this situation to a happy ending.''   Syria is believed to have been instrumental in the release ofFrench and West German hostages last year, acting as mediator amongIran, the kidnappers and countries whose nationals were held.   Assad's government has good relations with Iran and was its onlymajor Arab ally in the 8-year-war with Iraq suspended by acease-fire last August. Syria also has 40,000 soldiers in Lebanonand is its main power broker after nearly 14 years of sectariancivil war.   In her leter to Anderson, Mrs. Say mentioned a visit Friday toone of the world's oldest churches, where she prayed for hisrelease, better U.S.-Syrian relations and peace in Lebanon.   She hung a bracelet engraved with his name on a cross on thealtar of the Greek Catholic Church of St. Sergius near Damascus. Itwas built about 300 years after Christ's death in Maaloula, whosevillagers still speak his language, Aramaic.   ``I placed a bracelet with your name on the altar at Maaloula andprayed there for a healing of our personal wounds, and for thehealing of the wounds between our country and the countries of theMiddle East,'' Mrs. Say wrote.   ``I also prayed for peace for the people of Lebanon and freedomfor those who live in bondage as you do.''   His sister assured Anderson his two daughters, teen-age Gabriellaand 3-year-old Sulome, born after his abduction, were in good health.   ``Your beautiful children are fine and send their love as doesour family,'' she said. ``Your many friends and thousands of peoplein America work and pray every hour, every day for strength andfreedom for you and all the hostages.''</TEXT></DOC>
