An unconfirmed report in the West German media said hundredswere killed.   Romania virtually sealed its borders, blocking or restrictingtravel from neighboring Hungary, Yugoslavia and Bulgaria, and fromother countries, in an apparent effort to curtail reports of theunrest at Timisoara, western Romania.   Arriving flights were turned back around at the Bucharestairport. Bulgarian TV said travelers were held in trains for hoursbefore being sent back by Romanian border guards.   In a late evening report, the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug saidRomanian security forces took full control Monday of Timisoara,just 30 miles from the Yugoslav border. Ceausescu flew to Iranearlier in the day for a three-day official visit.   Premier Miklos Nemeth of Hungary said there were unconfirmedreports of protests in other Romanian cities and of soldiers beingplaced on alert.   A Yugoslav returning from Romania told The Associated Presspolice fired on the protesters and at least two people were killed.   He said other Yugoslav travelers reported seeing more bodies inTimisoara after security forces dispersed the largestanti-government protests since a protest by 10,000 workers atBrasov in 1987.   In West Germany, William Toetoek, an ethnic German writer whoimmigrated from Romania, was interviewed on Bremen radio and quotedwitnesses in Timisoara as saying 300-400 protesters were killed andhundreds injured.   None of the reports of high death tolls could be confirmed.   Bishop Endre Gyulay of the Roman Catholic diocese of Szeged inHungary, which includes Timisoara, told the church news agencyKathpress, based in Vienna, that 30 or 40 people fled across theborder Monday and reported two deaths, of an old woman and a29-year-old man   ``Police and troops moved in quickly,'' the Yugoslav travelersaid, but only police were seen firing on were seen shooting at thedemonstrators.   ``I saw two dead, including a child, on the streets,'' he said.Other Yugoslav travelers said soldiers were seen three-deep at mainintersections in Timisoara on Sunday. The official Hungarian newsagency MTI quoted a Czechoslovak, not identified, as saying tankswere in the streets.   Resentment has grown against Ceausescu, who has resisted theliberalization and reform sweeping through Eastern Europe. He hasbeen Communist Party chief since 1965, and with downfall of otherold guard Communists, has become the longest-serving leader in theSoviet bloc.   Ceausescu's crash industrialization program and the domesticausterity he imposed to repay Romania's $11 billion foreign debthave caused widespread shortages and food rationing. The pervasiveand feared secret police are the main agency used to keep thepeople under control.   Mihnea Berindei, vice chairman of the Paris-based RomanianLeague for Human Rights, said he had reports of police firing onthe demonstrators in Timisoara.   ``Shots were heard and there were injuries. Ambulances were seenrushing to and fro,'' he said, quoting witnesses.   ``There are reports of deaths, but we don't have any figures sofar because the entire area has been virtually isolated ... by thesecurity forces,'' Berindei said.   Anti-government protests apparently began after hundreds ofethnic Hungarians formed a human chain Friday night to prevent theeviction Friday of the Rev. Laszlo Toekes, a Reformed Churchclergyman who has championed their rights, Berindei said.   Toekes had been harassed for months by Romanian authorities. Heand his wife, who is pregnant, had remained inside his church sincemasked assailants tried to attack him in his neighboring apartmentNov. 2, Berindei said, again quoting witnesses.   He said he did not know where Toekes was Monday night.   Several thousand people, most of them ethnic Romanian studentsand workers, protested in downtown Timisoara on Saturday andbriefly occupied the Communist Party headquarters, breaking windowsand smashing furniture, Berindei said.   They also broke windows of bookstores, and burned the works ofCeausescu, whose books are prominently displayed, he said.   Protest continued Sunday, then police and army units intervenedand shots were fired, Berindei said.   Other unrest preceded the weekend protests, Berindei said,including a strike Dec. 8 at a truck plant in Brasov, north ofBucharest, and a student protest before that at hostels inBucharest.   In apparent response to the student action, Ceausescu orderedDec. 5 that their monthly stipends be increased by 10 percent, orabout $5 a month.   Official media did not mention the weekend unrest, devotingthemselves instead to Ceausescu's visit to Iran.   Emigres said Bucharest radio warned citizens on Sunday to remainorderly or face serious consequences, which in Romania can includelong jail sentences or forced labor.   Western diplomats reached by telephone Monday in Bucharest saidthe capital appeared calm but the international airport was heavilyguarded.   Thousands of Yugoslavs normally cross each day to Timisoara tosell goods to Romanians, but a Yugoslav customs official said theborders were sealed to all but official traffic.</TEXT></DOC>
