Traders and analysts said stocks had been due for a rebound from their recent decline, but they questioned whether the latest advance would turn out to be more than just a brief respite from that decline.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed back over the 2000 level by surging 37.34 points to 2026.67. The average rose nearly 18 points during the initial rally, preserved most of its gains through midday, and then added to them gradually through the afternoon to close at session highs.    The market's performance stood in sharp contrast to its showing in the previous two sessions, when stocks moved higher in early trading but then fizzled.    Nevertheless, market activity picked up only slightly from the very slow pace that has prevailed this week. New York Stock Exchange volume amounted to 127.8 million shares, compared with Tuesday's total of 119.5 million.    Broader market measures surged as well. Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index rose 4.04 to 261.13, while the Big Board composite index jumped 1.99 to 147.93. Also, 1,089 issues advanced in price on the Big Board and only 376 declined.    Traders attributed the market's initial strength to the impact of buy programs related to stock-index arbitrage, which went into effect as index futures rallied to substantial premiums to the cash indices.    They added that stocks also benefited from bargain-hunting by participants seeking to take advantage of recent weakness in several market sectors, especially technology issues, along with those seeking to offset short positions.    Although the market's rally was the sharpest since July 29, when the Dow Jones industrials soared 46.40 points, skepticism about its ability to preserve and extend its gains was widespread.    &quot;It's a nice day, but you have to put it in the perspective of where we've come from,&quot; said William E. Raftery, a technical analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. &quot;A lot of people were looking a week ago for a rally and never got it, and this is too much too late.&quot;    Mr. Raftery noted that the market hasn't shown itself to be capable of focusing its attention on any particular sector, which he sees as a requirement for any advances to be sustained. &quot;Right now, it doesn't appear that investors know where to turn in terms of leadership. Every couple of weeks, it seems like they're groping for a new idea,&quot; he said.    Richard I. Sichel, director of First Pennsylvania Bank's investment research division, said those abrupt shifts reflect the market's uncertainty about the outlook for the economy. &quot;That's why the leadership keeps changing in the market -- more often than it should,&quot; he said.    Mr. Sichel said his firm expects that the market's current lack of direction will give way to some improvement in prices, with a decline in interest rates as the catalyst. The market's rally yesterday coincided with a dip in the federal funds rate, a closely watched short-term rate, below the 7 3/4% mark.    &quot;You can't paint a really convincing picture that the stock market's cheap,&quot; he said, but he added that stocks would be more attractive than they are currently if rates drop.    Should that occur, Mr. Sichel said, those investors who have been pessimistic about the outlook for the economy and stock prices would become more optimistic fairly quickly. &quot;It would show that the economy doesn't have to self-destruct.&quot;    Several blue-chip issues were among the primary beneficiaries of the market's strength. Boeing soared 2 1/8 to 58 3/4, Philip Morris jumped 2 1/4 to 91 3/4, Minnesota Mining andamp; Manufacturing added 1 3/8 to 60 5/8, Du Pont rose 1 1/2 to 80 5/8, International Paper added 1 1/4 to 44 1/2 and Bethlehem Steel went up 7/8 to 21 1/8.    Computer issues, which have fallen out of favor lately, once again drew buying interest. International Business Machines rose 1 7/8 to 112 3/4, Cray Research gained 2 3/4 to 80 1/2, Unisys added 1 1/8 to 32 1/4, Compaq Computer jumped 2 1/8 to 54 1/2 and Hewlett-Packard climbed 1 to 45 3/4.    Airline stocks also rebounded from recent weakness. According to Dow Jones Professional Investor Report, First Boston repeated its buy recommendations on three airline issues: UAL, which surged 2 3/8 to 90 1/8; AMR, which added 1 3/8 to 43 1/4, and Delta Air Lines, which went up 3/4 to 46 3/4. NWA rose 3/4 to 43 3/8, while Texas Air gained 1/2 to 11 3/8 in American Stock Exchange trading.    Metals stocks helped pace the market's rally as well, led by Inco, which jumped 2 5/8 to 31 1/4. Aluminum Co. of America gained 1 3/4 to 50 1/4, Reynolds Metals rose 1 1/8 to 50 7/8, Phelps Dodge added 1 1/8 to 40 and Asarco went up 1/2 to 23 3/4.    Clorox lost 1/2 to 31 1/8 after surging 2 1/8 points Tuesday. Henkel KGaA said it doesn't plan to boost its stake in the company beyond 30% and isn't behind the recent surge in Clorox's stock price. The West German company, which said it owns between 26% and 27% of Clorox, acknowledged that it is continuing to buy the company's shares in the open market.    Centerior Energy slipped 7/8 to 13 1/8 after Ohio state regulators denied its request for emergency rate increases totaling $175 million for its two principal units, Cleveland Electric Illuminating and Toledo Edison.    Anchor Glass Container fell 7/8 to 12 1/2. PaineWebber lowered its investment rating on the stock, according to the investor report. Details were unavailable.    Varian Associates went up 1 1/4 to 27 1/2. Shearson Lehman Hutton raised its estimates of the company's earnings for the fiscal fourth quarter and year, which end Sept. 30. An analyst at the firm told the investor report that Varian has reversed a pattern of &quot;wicked losses&quot; in recent quarters.    Medtronic climbed 1 3/8 to 76 3/8. The company posted net income of $1.90 a share for the first quarter ended July 31, up from $1.44 a share a year ago. The latest results included a $24 million pretax gain from the settlement of a patent infringement lawsuit.    The American Stock Exchange index added 2.06 to 294.06. Volume was 7.7 million shares, down from 8.8 million Tuesday.    Tri-State Motor Transit surged 1 1/2 to 16 7/8. A group including Corsair Partners and Concord Financial Group, which raised its stake in the company to 11.26%, is pressuring the company to restructure. Otherwise, the group said, it may seek control of the company.    Duplex Products slid 7/8 to 18 3/8, after reporting net income for the third quarter ended July 30 of 31 cents a share, compared with 37 cents a share a year earlier. </TEXT></DOC>
