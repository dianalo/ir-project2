Richard Olsen, vice president and chief financial officer, said in an interview that for the quarter, Candela expects to report earnings of about $575,000, or 16 cents a share, compared with profit of $108,000, or 4 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenues rose to &quot;slightly less&quot; than $6 million from $2.9 million, Mr. Olsen said.    For fiscal 1988, Candela expects to report earnings of about $700,000, or 20 cents a share, compared with a loss of $1.3 million a year earlier, Mr. Olsen said. Revenues almost tripled to &quot;just under&quot; $16 million from $5.6 million, he added.    Candela, which makes lasers for medical applications, went public in 1986. Horace Furumoto, chairman and chief executive officer, said the company recently has completed its first phase as a public company, which included the development of lasers for removing birthmarks and for destroying kidney stones without surgery. In its second phase, the company plans to develop several new lasers for medical applications and new products for conducting laser light within the body.    The company's new laser with the largest potential market will be one for destroying gallstones, Mr. Furumoto said. Candela recently received Food and Drug Administration approval to begin clinical testing of a procedure in which a thin fiber optic tube is inserted through a small incision to conduct laser light into the gallbladder. The procedure involves use of a Candela laser tailored for gallstone treatment to deliver precisely controlled bursts of light that blast the stones to bits.    Candela already has started clinical testing of its gallstone laser in a nonsurgical procedure in which a fiber optic tube is orally inserted to reach stones lodged in the duct between the gallbladder and the digestive tract, Mr. Olsen said.    The company also is developing three lasers to treat various eye disorders. One of them is designed to alleviate glaucoma, a disease in which fluid builds up inside the eye and exerts harmful pressure, by boring a small hole for draining the fluid. Another laser will coagulate leaky blood vessels that threaten vision in a disease called macular degeneration, a growing problem among the elderly. The third laser for eye diseases is designed to remove filaments that sometimes grow within the eyeball and cause vision problems. </TEXT></DOC>
