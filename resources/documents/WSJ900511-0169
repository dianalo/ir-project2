Researchers at the University of Virginia showed 36smokers the movies made of their coronary arteries duringangiography, when a fluid visible on X-rays flows through thearteries, revealing sections where blood flow is restrictedby fatty deposits. Another 36 smokers were shown onlydrawings of their clogged arteries. One to two years later,most of the smokers in both groups had cut back oncigarettes.   But among 17 of the smokers who underwent coronary-bypasssurgery, those who saw only drawings of their cloggedcoronaries resumed their old smoking habits after surgery.Bypass patients who viewed the actual films of theirarteries, however, kept away from cigarettes, particularly ifthe films showed two or three arteries were clogged.                                                                                                          AUTOMATIC SHOCK                                                                                                          The widely hailed implantable, automatic defibrillator tostop irregular heart beats does, indeed, save and prolonglives.   The implantable defibrillator, which automaticallydelivers a shock to the heart when it detects alife-threatening change in the heartbeat, was invented atJohns Hopkins's medical school in 1980. It was put on themarket in 1985.   So far the device has been implanted in about 7,000patients at 100 medical centers around the world. A new studyshows that 94% are still alive five years later and 85% arealive 10 years after implantation, says Levi Watkins of JohnsHopkins. The 10-year survival rate shows the defibrillator is&quot;the most signigicant advance in the treatment of malignantcardiac arrhythmias in this decade,&quot; Dr. Watkins says.   The device costs about $15,000, and implanting it costsanother $15,000. About 4% of the patients die as a result ofthe surgery, and 5% more develop complications that require asecond operation. New lithium batteries have to be installedevery two years in the generator that is implanted in theabdomen.                                                                                                          LOVE AND DEATH                                                                                                          Will sex kill me? It's a question that haunts many apatient recovering from a heart attack.   Sexual intercourse places about the same degree of demandon the heart as walking briskly or climbing two flights ofstairs, say three University of Florida doctors in thejournal Medical Aspects of Human Sexuality. &quot;Generally, if apatient can walk on a treadmill at more than two miles perhour at a 10% grade&quot; without any significant increase inblood pressure or adverse changes in the electrocardiogram,then &quot;his/her exercise capacity should be sufficient to allowfor safe sexual relations with the usual partner,&quot; theywrite.   For some anxious patients, a drug taken just beforeintercourse might prevent the chest pains and reassure thepatients, they suggest. However, they add, &quot;patients shouldalso be aware that extramarital sex has been associated witha higher risk of sudden death.&quot;                                                                                                          BIGGER THAN BUSH                                                                                                          The heart gets heavy news coverage even without apublicist. A computerized search through an electronic database of The Wall Street Journal's news pages found there were433 separate news articles in 1989 that mentioned the heart,at least as it related to medical matters. That's morearticles in the Journal's pages last year than those thatmentioned George Bush (397), Donald Trump (230), MichaelMilken (235), mutual funds (296), or cancer (265). Somesubjects, of course, received more attention. There were 597articles that mentioned IBM, and more than 2,000 discussedinflation.                                                                                                          MYSTERY UNMASKED                                                                                                          The riddle of &quot;Syndrome X&quot; may have been solved.   Syndrome X is characterized by chest pains similar tothose seen in coronary heart disease, but X-ray angiographicstudies fail to find any evidence of clogged coronaryarteries. The patients are hypersensitive to the catheterthat is threaded into the heart's coronary arteries duringthe angiography procedure, a reaction rarely seen in coronaryheart-disease patients. Syndrome X patients often havedysfunction of the esophagus and asthma-like constriction ofthe bronchial passages.   The syndrome is seen in about 100,000 new patients everyyear; about two-thirds are women.   &quot;Many are labeled neurotic or hysterical when they do havepain,&quot; says Richard O. Cannon III, a researcher with theNational Heart, Blood and Lung Institute. &quot;They've beenmislabeled and dealt with poorly by health-careprofessionals.&quot;   Dr. Cannon and other scientists now believe Syndrome X iscaused by abnormalities of blood vessels that are too smallto be seen by X-ray angiography. These tiny vessels serve theso-called smooth muscles, which include not only the arteriesbut also such tissues as the esophagus and bronchial tubes.Some of the same drugs that relieve coronary-artery diseaseseem to help many Syndrome X patients.   The researchers now call the condition &quot;microvascularangina.&quot; Because it involves more than just angina-like chestpains, microvascular angina might not be the best name, saysDr. Cannon. But, he adds, &quot;patients prefer it to Syndrome X.&quot;                                                                                                          CHOLESTEROL CONFUSION                                                                                                          So you think your cholesterol level is, say, 210? Notanymore. It's now 5.43.   In an example of monumentally bad timing, medical journalschanged the standard measuring unit for blood-cholesterollevels just as the National Cholesterol Education Programbegan its huge education effort to make the public aware ofthe cholesterol-heart disease link.   The core of the NCEP -- a joint effort of the federalgovernment and private industry -- is guidelines on &quot;risklevels&quot; of cholesterol in the blood, stated in milligrams ofcholesterol per deciliter of blood plasma, the fluid part ofthe blood. A level below 200 is considered a &quot;normal&quot; risk;above 240 milligrams per deciliter is considered a high risk.   Grams and liters are metric measurements that medicaljournals have been using for years for weights and volumesrespectively. But about three years ago, U.S. medicaljournals began switching to the Systeme Internationald'Unites, or SI, the international system of measuring units.   In the SI, the proper units for stating the concentrationof a substance in a volume is moles per liter, the mole beinga standard number of atoms, molecules or particles. Thus,blood-cholesterol levels are now stated in millimoles perliter of blood plasma. A cholesterol level of 210 milligramsper deciliter is now officially 5.43 millimoles per liter.   The change upsets some doctors. &quot;We must not forcephysicians to learn one system to be able to read the medicalliterature and then have them translate the values intoanother language that can be understood by the public,&quot; onedistressed doctor wrote the editor of the New England Journalof Medicine.                                                                                                          AFTER THE ATTACK                                                                                                          You show up at your hospital with chest pains and after aseries of tests, your fears are confirmed: You've had a heartattack or an attack of angina. What happens next?   Based on 35,000 such cases at Ohio State UniversityHospitals in Columbus, here's a look at what to expect:   -- About 20% of patients diagnosed with heart disease havebypass surgery.   -- 15% are referred for coronary angioplasty.   -- About 45% to 55% are treated with drugs, whichsuccessfully alleviate symptoms for at least several years.   -- An additional 20% are treated initially with drugs,half of whom come back for either angioplasty or bypass whenthe drugs don't work. The rest are too sick for eithersurgery or balloon treatment, and drugs are their onlyoption.</TEXT></DOC>
