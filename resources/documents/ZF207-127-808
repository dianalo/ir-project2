 In theage of multitasking, the Macintosh's interface is beginning toshow its limitations.andP;  The desktop is becoming crowded withaccessories and the metaphors, which were once strongly intuitive,are now weakening.andP;  While graphics can be manipulated by dragging,for example, text must be cut-and-pasted, and the trash can isused to eject the disk as well as erase files.andP;  Integratingapplications and providing an uncluttered but powerful interfacethat spans them all will be the Macintosh's biggest hurdle in thecoming years.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Product:   Apple Macintosh (Microcomputer) (usage).andO;Topic:     User InterfaceGraphical User Interface.andO;Feature:   illustrationphotograph.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>The interface that launched a thousand imitationsandM;San Francisco -- If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, then thesuccess of the Macintosh graphical user interface may have proven to be toomuch of a good thing.andP;  With graphical user interfaces cropping up all overother platforms -- Presentation Manager on OS/2, Open Look and Motif on Unix,NextStep on NeXT -- the Mac would appear to be losing its edge in thelook-and-feel sweepstakes.andM;The sudden flurry of Macalikes has led many observers to take another look atthe Mac's own interface.andP;  Built with the single user in mind, the Mac &quot;wasdesigned to educate the market [to] the fact that computers can be easy touse,&quot; said Adele Goldeberg, president of ParcPlace.andP;  &quot;Therefore it wasimportant to have a single metaphor.&quot;andM;As long as the Mac catered to the personal information needs of individuals,that metaphor -- the desktop -- was appropriate, and the consistency of theinterface across applications gave new users entree into computing by easingthe burden of learning programs.andM;But in the eyes of some developers and users, the desktop metaphor has wornthin.andP;  As anyone who's been around the desktop knows, the consistentinterface is in fact inconsistent.andP;  Metaphors get mixed, with windowsresiding on top of the desktop, and messages get garbled, with the trash canbeing used to delete a file and to eject a disk.andM;A succession of improvements, such as the hierarchical file structure,enhanced the desktop metaphor.andP;  Then came HyperCard, providing a new metaphor-- that of stacks of note cards.andP;  With its single-window, single-clickinterface, HyperCard departed significantly from the Mac interface standard.andM;In so doing, it introduced programming techniques to a whole new class ofusers.andP;  More than that, the program popularized the notion of linkinginformation hypertext fashion.andP;  Those who were ready for it had a powerfulnew tool for extending the Macintosh's reach.andM;Hot-wiring the Mac for hot links.andP;  When the Macintosh entered the world, fewcould have anticipated the current demand for such multitasking,hypertext-like capabilities as &quot;hot links&quot; between applications runningsimultaneously -- so that, for instance, when you modify your spreadsheet youautomatically update the graph in a separate chart program.andM;Because other interfaces support true multitasking, the challenge for Appleis to maintain continuity with its installed base and at the same time offerusers an interface that allows them to forge dynamic links with otherprograms, some of which may reside on other machines.andM;&quot;Apple at the moment has the problem of wanting to adhere to [its] standard,yet it really needs to evolve if it's not to get outmoded,&quot; said AndrewSinger, vice president of engineering at Radius.andP;  Thus, Apple may be forcedinto the awkward position of having to retrofit its system software, andconsequently its interface, to an architecture designed around an oldcut-and-paste model of sharing data among applications.andM;Not everyone agrees that the addition of interprocess communication -- theability to dynamically link data -- will change the Mac's character.andP;  &quot;We canadd new functionality without disrupting the user's experience,&quot; said ChrisEspinosa, Apple's marketing manager of advanced technology.andP;  As with theintroduction of hierarchical files and MultiFinder, &quot;innovations are acontinual process integral to the character of the Mac,&quot; he said, andshouldn't require radical retraining of users.andM;Judging from the number of desk accessories that have grown up on the Mac tocompensate for the lack of multitasking capabilities, the desktop wouldappear to have grown inadequate.andP;  Were it not for the Apple paperweight inthe upper left-hand corner sitting on all those DAs, the fully configureddesktop might resemble the cockpit of a 747.andM;And yet the desktop has proved remarkably versatile.andP;  Just when you thoughtyou'd run out of DA slots, along comes Suitcase.andP;  Tear-off, hierarchical andnow pop-up menus have eased the problem of getting around large screens.andO;Further enhancements possible under MultiFinder, such as those found in Motifor Presentation Manager that allow you to iconize a window without closingit, may solve some of the clutter that tends to accumulate on the expandeddesktop.andP;  After five years, we've grown accustomed to the interface.andM;Still, even an expanded desktop fills up fast.andP;  &quot;One of the limitations ofthe desktop metaphor is that as you get an enormous number of files, youdon't want to think of it as a desk any more,&quot; said Andy Hertzfeld, one ofthe original Macintosh developers.andP;  Hertzfeld said he believes that thedesktop metaphor can be extended in a number of ways -- by zooming, forexample.andP;  &quot;Why does everything have to be a fixed size?andP;  You should be ableto zoom back and see many more smaller things,&quot; he said.andP;  Hertzfeld alsoadvocates &quot;programmatic viewing,&quot; special filters for selecting a class offiles to view, such as all the Paint files created in the last three days.andM;Joy Mountford, Apple's Human Interface Group manager, said, &quot;You can alwaysprovide users with extra features that you have your pet peeves about.andO;What's limited at the moment is the tremendous emphasis on solely using textand icons.andP;  We need a much better way of accessing remote information, suchas sound, video, graphics and networks of information.&quot;andM;And advanced users want added control as well as more information.andP;  &quot;The flipside of user friendly is that you don't know what's going on,&quot; said JaneVieder, who teaches about computers at San Francisco State University'sSchool of Creative Arts.andP;  &quot;[The Mac] needs to be able to break into advancedmode where you can tell what the hell's going on.andP;  When it doesn't workproperly, you think it's enigmatic.&quot;andM;Extending the desktop metaphor, then, to create filters on information out inthe world is not a simple matter.andP;  &quot;You need to step outside of the desktop,metaphorically speaking, because you can't do everything just on your desk,&quot;said Mountford.andM;Such innovation, of course, comes at a price.andP;  When developers stray from thestandard Mac interface, advanced users may gain power and flexibility butless-experienced users are apt to be overwhelmed by unfamiliar features andoptions.andM;&quot;There's a good reason not to change things arbitrarily on people becausethere's an investment in learning to do things a certain way,&quot; said PeterMiller, partner in On Technology.andP;  &quot;There's a base of experience that's beenbuilt up now that you want to build off of.andP;  The question is, where do youinnovate within that?&quot;andM;A desktop by any other name ...andP;  .  Mountford takes a larger view of thedesktop than the term &quot;desktop&quot; would suggest.andP;  &quot;There's a lot of things youcan do within the existing interface to make it more self-revealing to theuser,&quot; she said.andP;  By integrating and embedding features, &quot;you should be ableto find ways of making [the Mac] more user configurable,&quot; she said.andP;  Insteadof continually adding options, developers should ask, &quot;How can we accommodatethe interface to do what [users] really want to be able to do?&quot;andP;  The questionis not rhetorical.andP;  Metaphor means to &quot;carry over&quot; -- exactly the function ofthe interface -- to communicate instructions from the user and providefeedback from the machine.andP;  &quot;The effectiveness of [the computer] is tied tohow we tell it what to do,&quot; said ParcPlace's Goldberg.andM;The Mac interface, of course, is not just window dressing.andP;  Icons representpotential actions.andP;  The file management functions of the Finder, such as theability to launch an application from a data file, are integral to thedesktop.andP;  According to Charles Irby, vice president of product development atMetaphor Computer Systems and one of the developers of the Xerox Stargraphical user interface, which is generally regarded as the Mac's precursor,there are three major interface issues: control mechanisms, or how the usertells the computer what to do; the visual display, which provides feedback tothe user; and what Irby calls the conceptual model, or &quot;how you get thesethings to feel like they're all part of the same system.&quot;andM;Irby maintained that the Mac fails primarily on the third issue by giving theuser an inconsistent model or map of how things work.andP;  &quot;If you use differentMac tools, you realize that inside the tools they actually behave verydifferently,&quot; he said.andP;  For instance, you may move a graphic by selecting itand dragging it to another part of the screen, but you cut and paste text.andM;&quot;Cut and paste is a great way to move things between applications, but it'sintegration on a very gross scale,&quot; Singer said.andP;  &quot;[(Integration] would be alot greater if every application was living on exactly the same kind of datastructure, so you could cut and paste anything into anything.&quot;andP;  Suchintegration would allow users to graft text from a word processing file ontoa graphic, for example, or to use the same text editing tools in a graphicsprogram as in a word processor.andM;Although there are PICT graphics, MacWrite text formats and file transferutilities between specific programs, &quot;there's no unifying data transfer modelunderneath the Clipboard,&quot; Singer said.andP;  &quot;Here's the Mac -- it's multifont,multistyle, multisize text, but when you move things around, you move ASCII.andO;Isn't that a little inconsistent?&quot;andM;While Apple's Mountford agreed that integration is essential to expanding thedesktop, she reiterated that &quot;you just can't go and create entirely newmetaphors.andP;  You need to think about what it is we actually do and how to addmore capabilities so it's a richer metaphor, not necessarily an alternativemetaphor.&quot;andM;Mountford said that she favors extending the desktop metaphor to &quot;integrateother real-world artifacts&quot; -- fax, telephone, video, etc.andP;  To win newconverts to computing, she said, the Macintosh must reflect the need toconnect various devices that people use every day.andP;  The WristMac, awatch-size device from Ex Machina of New York that a user can program from ahome or office computer, is an indication, Mountford said, of how thehardware platform might evolve toward a range of component computer systems.andO;&quot;This is the stuff that will force people to face systems integration,&quot; shesaid.andM;A multimedia metaphor.andP;  The need for large-scale integration is nowhere moreapparent than in multimedia applications, where the ability to coordinatevarious devices--videodisc players, monitors and computers--is central.andP;  Hereagain, however, the Mac faces difficulties, according to multimediadevelopers.andP;  &quot;[The Mac] doesn't support multiple processing, and there's nomechanism for communicating between multiple processes,&quot; said John Thompson,who teaches computational media at New York University.andP;  &quot;There's no metaphorfor that.&quot;andP;  If there were, Thompson suggested, &quot;[the Mac] could be addressedfrom another program, not just by the user.andP;  Basically you'd like aninterface to be user-programmable.&quot;andM;Multimedia was one of the first and most prominent applications users foundfor HyperCard.andP;  By letting users and stack developers customize their owninterfaces and write their own programs, HyperCard allows them to accessindexed data, graphics and sound on videodiscs and CD-ROM.andM;&quot;HyperCard is sort of an alternative user interface,&quot; Singer said.andP;  &quot;Yet it'snot really a complete interface; it's kind of halfway in the middle.&quot;andP;  As astand-in for the Finder, HyperCard is easily mistaken for an alternativemetaphor.andP;  &quot;That's one way the Mac might evolve,&quot; said Singer.andP;  &quot;It might bea way for people to achieve integration without having to change the basestandard.&quot;andM;Although Mountford disagreed with the characterization of HyperCard as anentirely new or alternative metaphor -- she said she views it more as a cardfile system or notebook on the desktop -- she acknowledged that &quot;HyperCardhas been very good at allowing new users to create their own personaldatabases.&quot;andM;With hooks to CL/1, SQL and MacWork-Station in the offing, HyperCard hasbecome a popular interface contender for remote databases, especially incorporate settings where programming talent comes at a premium.andP;  Coupled withits multimedia capabilities, HyperCard clearly extends the reach of theMacintosh desktop.andP;  And by bringing programming to the end user, itencourages exploration and diversity.andM;A paradoxical symbiosis exists in all of this.andP;  Apple and other developerscannot provide users with tools until users themselves have determined whatit is they want to do, while users need tools to discover what's possible.andO;As with all innovation, it's a process of education.andP;  &quot;Providing more linkingcapabilities will lead us to providing users with additional tools to betterunderstand more concepts,&quot; Mountford said.andP;  &quot;How do people work withhypertext, hyperauthoring?andP;  The number of people that have reasonable answersto this stuff is very limited, so we're all sort of making a stab in thedark.&quot;andM;Whether one Macintosh interface -- some combination of HyperCard and thestandard Mac, perhaps -- will suffice for the needs of both novice andadvanced users remains to be seen.andP;  According to Kristee Kreitman,interface/design director for Apple's multimedia group, &quot;We don't have theone metaphor that's going to work across all the applications, or all themultimedia applications.andP;  If we knew the answer to these things, we'd buildthem in right now.&quot;andM;Running ahead of the crowd.andP;  For now, the adoption of the graphical userinterface as a de facto standard plays into Apple's hands.andP;  Apple can holdits interface card close in, knowing that the Mac has stood the test of timeand countless user interactions.andP;  Throughout, the desktop has proved to be aremarkably robust and eminently adaptable interface, as HyperCarddemonstrates.andM;While all the new interfaces on the block have made enhancements to thegraphical user interface paradigm, the Mac has, for the moment, what theother platforms lack: a full deck of ready-to-use programs.andP;  With both XWindows and 32-bit-clean Mac programs, including HyperCard, able to run onA/UX, Apple may even be able to satisfy the Unix user who wants the best ofboth worlds.andM;Eventually, however, the need for programs to communicate across variousplatforms will change the face of computing, and Apple will have to adapt.andO;In some sense, all the hype over hypertext, hypermedia and HyperCard has notbeen hype at all but an effort to educate the market, test it for what usersreally want and prepare the way for the next evolution in personal computing.andO;Clearly the key will be getting programs -- and machines -- communicating,and for that Apple may have to do an about-face.andM;The eroding Mac interfaceandM;In a recent Dataquest poll on features of computing environments, using a&quot;graphical interface&quot; was found only second in importance to having&quot;consistency across applications.&quot;andM;Yet the consistency that was the very strength of Macintosh software iseroding at an increasing rate.andP;  As the Mac grows in popularity, interfacestandards get diluted by a general laissez-faire attitude, which is buoyed byApple's sales figures.andP;  Sometimes, the interface is bent for good reasons,providing a genuine improvement.andP;  Infractions, however, are most oftengratuitous, and they compromise the efficacy of the interface.andM;Find the tab.andP;  Imagine you are a temporary secretary who is required to knowmost Macintosh, word processors.andP;  Don't count on developers to make it easyto remember ruler icons.andP;  The icons often look different from one wordprocessing application to the next, including some that are offered by thesame publisher.andP;  Even when icons are shared by applications, they oftenrepresent different functions.andP;  WriteNow's right tab, for example, isidentical to the right margin icon in Microsoft Word, Microsoft Works andWordPerfect.andP;  FullWrite Professional's center tab is identical to MacWrite'sleft tab.andP;  The latter is particularly unfortunate because MacWrite is such anestablished standard.andM;Icon confusion.andP;  While one can generally guess what the tab icons stand for,expertise in cryptography is a must to discover the correspondence betweenicons and their functions.andP;  The problem is further complicated by theexistence of several icons representing the same function.andP;  The croppingtools in the page-layout applications Aldus PageMaker, QuarkXPress andReady,Set,Go!andP;  4.5, for example, each employ a different icon to perform thesame function.andM;Non-standard dialogs.andP;  Dialog and alert box design is another area that canconfuse even the most experienced users.andP;  In Claris' SmartForms Designer, forexample, the dialog boxes diverge from the User Interface Guidelines, theBible of Mac interface design.andP;  The two main divergences, which don't appearto improve upon the existing Mac interface, are positioning dialog box titlesat the bottom of the boxes and replacing the standard Macintosh buttons withclones of HyperCard &quot;roundrect&quot; buttons.andM;Displacing the titles to the bottom of dialog boxes is inconsistent with theway the rest of the Mac application world treats dialog boxes.andP;  Titles indialog boxes are typically positioned at the top, where the users' eyesnaturally fall.andM;The HyperCard &quot;roundrect&quot; button style denotes a user-definable button, yetSmartForms' &quot;roundrect&quot; buttons are not user-definable.andM;Progress needs to be made in evolving the interface.andP;  Even more importantly,as the examples demonstrate, standards or guidelines are needed to improvethe consistency and quality of the user experience.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
