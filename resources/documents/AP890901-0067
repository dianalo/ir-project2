He called media chase boats over to his speedboat Thursday tophotograph him holding a tiny pollack, indicating it didn't reallycount because it was barely bigger than his lure.   Still, it seemed maybe the president's bad-luck fishing streakhad been broken.   But today, his staff revealed the truth. It was a friend whocaught the fish on Bush's boat Thursday evening and thephotographers had misunderstood because the president was holding itup.   The president, an avid athlete, has been spending his summervacation at his seaside home here jogging, golfing and boating.   The fishing trip Thursday extended a steak of a fortnight withnary a catch for the president.   His reputation as an angler in serious trouble, Bush threw downthe gauntlet earlier Thursday.   ``Between now and when I leave on Monday, I guarantee you, Ipositively guarantee you that this jinx will be broken,'' Bush toldreporters.   The five-inch pollack, a food fish belonging to the cod family,bit on a lure that was almost its size.   Bush threw it back and indicated to onlookers that the catchdidn't count against his promise to pull in a bluefish or othergamefish.   By the end of the day, the fishing story was taking on a life ofits own, with Bush inviting the press corps to watch him take offfor a late-afternoon fishing jaunt.   When they arrived at the pier, the Bushes were greeted by a smalldemonstration of family members and friends singing ``When the fishcome marching in,'' and chanting, ``Go For the Bluefish.''   They jumped up and down waving signs that read, ``Fish till youdrop,'' ``You can do it,'' ``1,000 dreams of bites,'' ``A fish a daykeeps the press away.''   Media representatives wore T-shirts reading ``Fish watch'' with acircled fish and a line through it indicating no fish.</TEXT></DOC>
