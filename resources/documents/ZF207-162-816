both are based on the80386SX, and the two-floppy model of the lap-top costs around $3,600, the20Mb lap-top is around $4,000, the desktops around $4,700.andM;Microsoft Japan will start marketing OS/2 seriously in June, and in an effortto get manufacturers to promote the operating system, is offering themrelease 4.1 of the Multiplan spreadsheet for OS/2, initially for NEC CorpPC-9801 personal computers, and NEC and IBM Japan are both expected to signto bundle the program with their microcomputers.andM;Japan's Council for Science andamp; Technology has delivered to the government anew report recommending long-term research goals, in which it urgesdevelopment of computers that can learn, can understand meaning, canrecognise speech without having to be trained to an individual speaker, andfilter out background noise: the report forecasts that information andelectronic technologies are likely to figure prominently in the future indisaster prediction, home health care, education and improvement of theworking environment, but warns that new technologies are likely to create newsocial problems, suggesting new rules will be needed to protect individualsprivacy and intellectual property.andM;In the Japanese corporate state, such reports are generally triggers foraction rather than tomes that gather dust on the shelves of some minister,and the specific areas recommended for research by the Council for Science andamp;Technology are artificial intelligence high-speed image processing; newmaterials, advanced circuit designs and new manufacturing technologies forlogic elements; and higher capacity memory chips; the report also warns thatmore researchers, particularly software engineers, must be trained to meetthe research goals - according to government forecasts, Japan's shortfall ofprogrammers and system engineers will top 960,000 by the years 2000, againsta 40,000 shortfall in 1985; it also recommends joint research with foreignscientists, and that the government should put up even more of the cash forresearch programmes than it has in the past, on the grounds that futurerequirements are of a more social nature than in the recent past.andM;Tokyo-based IBM-compatible board vendor Nippon Board Computer has developedAT-compatible lap-top computers equipped with high-capacity Winchesters,reports Newsbytes Japan: the company came out with a 16-bit NBCC286 laptop atthe end of last month, and follows up this month with a 32-bit NBCC386 laptopfor overseas markets, and an NBC386AX lapt-top to the AX standard for theJapanese market; the NBCC286 has a 16MHz 80C286 processor with 2Mb memoryexpandable to 5Mb, and 16-greyscale backlit liquid crystal display with 640by 480 resolution, and built-in Winchesters ranging from 20Mb to as high as400Mb, with batteries that last two hours, all packed into a unit 12.6&quot; wideby 13.6&quot; deep by 3.6&quot; thick, weighing 12.1 1bs; no prices yet, but NipponBoard Computer will export the new lap-tops first to Europe, Canada andSoutheast Asian countries, but not, initially the US because of the punitivetariffs imposed there on lap-top computers.andM;Omron Tateisi Electronics is already upgrading its Luna Unix System Vworkstation, launched only last October: the Luna 6W adds a graphics ASICchip that enables the user to paint graphics directly on the screen; theproprietary graphics chip is claimed to be able to draw 600,000 short linesper second.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
