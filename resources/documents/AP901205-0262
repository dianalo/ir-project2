PLC, the world'ssecond-largest advertising agency group, said Wednesday it lost98.2 million pounds, or $166 million, in fiscal 1990, the biggestyearly loss ever for such a company.   It was the second consecutive annual loss for the company thatgrew rapidly through acquisitions in the 1980s to become one of thebiggest advertising and marketing services companies in the world.   But the company stumbled when it branched out into theconsulting business and has spent more than a year arranging salesof those operations.   In announcing its huge loss, Saatchi also said it wouldn't pay adividend to its shareholders this year. It paid a dividend of 9pence, or 15 cents, a share a year ago.   The company blamed the loss for the year ended Sept. 30 on itsefforts to focus on its communications operations and to withdrawfrom consulting.   ``Our withdrawal from consulting reduces our downside risk,''the company said in a statement.   Saatchi said it plans to concentrate on advertising, mediabuying, direct marketing and public relations.   But Saatchi's operating results from communications businesseslike these declined in the latest year. Results were strong in theUnited States and continental Europe, but sank in Britain and therest of the world.   The overall loss was the second annual loss in a row forSaatchi, which had previously bought ads of its own to tout itsstring of earnings gains. Saatchi lost 72.7 million pounds infiscal 1989.   Chairman Maurice Saatchi said in a statement ``1991 will be adifficult year for the group but when market conditions do improveI believe the group will be well positioned to benefit from theupturn.''   Advertising agencies generally have been hurt by the worldwideeconomic downturn.   WPP Group PLC, the world's largest advertising group, last monthannounced that its pre-tax profit wouldn't match analysts'expectations of 110 million pounds, or $213 million, and the newssent the company's share price diving.   Neil Blackley, an advertising analyst with the London investmentfirm James Capel and Co,. said, ``The outlook is very poor indeedwith the U.S. economy weakening and the economies going down inmainland Europe and the impact on margins will be felt.''   Saatchi's ``financial position is not good. In order to survivethe company is going to have to restructure'' debt of 176.5 millionpounds, or $342 million, he said.   The loss for fiscal 1990 reflected an extraordinary loss of 76.9million pounds, or $130 million, on asset disposals, propertyprovisions, and other expenses, compared with a loss of 58.5million pounds on such items a year earlier.   Pre-tax profit rose 63 percent to 35.6 million pounds, or $60million, from 21.8 million pounds a year earlier. But the latestresults were helped by substantially reduced restructuring costscompared with a year ago.   The 1989 results included reorganization and streamlining of thegroup's communications division plus costs from its consultingbusiness.   Sales dropped 17 percent to 808.1 million pounds, or $1.37billion, from 973.5 million pounds in fiscal 1989.   Operating profit for its communications division fell 10 percentto 63 million pounds, or $106 million.   Its U.S. communications activities had a 12 percent rise inoperating profit while continental European operations posted a 25percent gain. But the operating profit from British communicationsactivities fell 48 percent and in the rest of the world, it fell 72percent.   Saatchi said that its two remaining consulting businesses willbe sold when market conditions improve. They are LitigationSciences Inc. of Los Angeles and MSL International, a London-basedexecutive recruitment business.   It completed the $70 million sale of Gartner Group Inc., aStamford, Conn.-based market information company, earlier thisyear. The price was below Saatchi's original expectations.   Saatchi's results were converted at an averaged exchange ratefor the fiscal year of $1.69 to the pound.</TEXT></DOC>
