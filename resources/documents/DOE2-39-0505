Using the afterloading-iridium-192-technique, the three-year-survival-ratewas 76%, five-year-survival 60%. A comparable groupe of 185 cases treatedby intracavitary radium-226 had five-year-survival of only 40% (pandless;0,001).With afterloading high-dose irradiation younger patients had five-year-survivalof 75%, older patients (70 years and more) 51%; when tumor grading wasone survival figures reached 76%, with tumor grading 2 and 3 only 41%.Severe radiation side effects did not occur with the optimal intrauterinesingle dose of 850 cGy (four times) and 700 cGy intravaginal (once),nor could any severe complications be observed when the total rectaldose did not exceed 500 cGy. In only 8% of the cases the treatment wascombined with external irradiation (Cobalt-60). Intrauterine and intravaginalapplications were performed without anaesthesia and the hospitalisationtime was very short.</TEXT></DOC>
