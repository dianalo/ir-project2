His cousin, John Waite, said that as time goes on it becomesmore difficult to believe Waite is alive.   However, John Waite added: ``He is such a nice, genuine guy Icannot imagine even a desperado wanting to do him any harm.''   The Church Army, the Church of England's evangelical branch,organized prayer vigils at the cathedrals of Winchester, Bristol,Liverpool, Rochester and London's Southwark.   Waite was in Lebanon trying to negotiate freedom for otherWestern hostages when he disappeared on Jan. 20, 1987.   He is among 18 foreigners missing in Lebanon. They include eightAmericans, four Britons, two West Germans, two Swiss and Italianand an Irishman.   Most of the foreign hostages are believed held by pro-IranianShiite Moslem underground factions.   Held longest is American Terry Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,1985.   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, addressing the ConservativeParty conference in Blackpool, recalled the plight of Waite and thetwo other British hostages.   ``We think of Terry Waite, Brian Keenan, John McCarthy and oftheir families and friends who endure so much.   ``Any government which has influence over those who holdhostages should be ready as a matter of course to use thatinfluence to bring about their release,'' Mrs. Thatcher said.   ``A country cannot support terrorism and still expect to betreated as a member of the international community. To takehostages is to exclude yourself from the civilized world.''</TEXT></DOC>
