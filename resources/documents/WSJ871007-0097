Separately, Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., a unit of American Express Corp., unveiled its own certificates of deposit with returns linked to the Sandamp;P 500 index in either direction. The Chase and Shearson CDs are both federally insured.    With the new Chase account, called the decreasing index alternative, savers may earn interest ranging from nil to a maximum rate equal to 105% of any percentage decline in the Sandamp;P 500 index over 12 months. Index-linked CDs for shorter time periods earn a smaller multiple of any percentage decline in the index.    So, if the Sandamp;P 500 index fell 10% over a year, the holder of a 12-month CD would receive 10.5% interest on the funds. With a 10% drop in the index over half a year, the holder of a six-month CD would receive 60% of the decline for the period, or 6% interest. A holder of a three-month bear CD would receive 45% of any decline in the Sandamp;P 500 index in that period.    The Shearson CDs require a minimum $1,000 deposit and are issued by banks for 90-day terms. A one-year CD would pay, for example, 3% interest if the Sandamp;P 500 index moved 10%, or 2% if an investor preferred a guaranteed annual minimum interest rate of 4% annually.    The timing of Chase's announcement, initially at least, appears good. Coincidentally, the Sandamp;P 500 index yesterday dropped 2.7%. However, the index still is up more than 31.8% since the year began.    Chase expects the bear version to appeal to those who already have stock portfolios.    &quot;For people with money in the stock market, (the bear account) provides a very attractive hedge against a downturn,&quot; said Chase's treasurer, J. Richards Zecher. &quot;It puts into the hands of any investor capabilities formerly available only to money managers in larger institutions.&quot;    Chase thinks the bear version &quot;will appeal to a slightly different person than the bull version of the account,&quot; a spokesman said. &quot;The bull version was for people who wanted to participate in the stock market's rise but didn't want to risk their capital.&quot;    The bull version of the account, introduced by Chase in March, drew the greatest response from savers for any product since the federal government deregulated rates paid on CDs, about four years ago. The account has been so successful that Charles Schwab andamp; Co., a discount broker, is selling the Chase account through its 105 offices.    As with the bull version, known as the market index investment account, the bear account carries no commissions or fees and is insured to $100,000 by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. The bear account is available with three-month, six-month as well as one-year maturities, as is the bull account.    For the saver uncomfortable with the possibility that if the Sandamp;P 500 index didn't decline in a given time period, the holder wouldn't receive any interest, Chase is offering a bear CD with a 4% guaranteed minimum annual rate, as it did with the bull version.    However, a saver who chooses the minimum annual return would earn less if the index dropped than one who forgoes the guaranteed minimum return.    The warm reception that the market index investment account received coupled with concerns about a possible downturn in the stock market encouraged Chase to introduce the decreasing index alternative, the company said.    Despite the apparent popularity of the index-linked account, though, only a few banking companies -- notably Northern Trust Co. in Chicago and Fleet Financial Group Inc. in Providence, R.I. -- have followed Chase's lead in offering accounts linked to the stock market.    Bankers offer two reasons: A bank needs a fairly active and sophisticated treasury department to know how to structure the hedges. Chase invests in Sandamp;P 500 options and futures to hedge its risk and to assure it can pay the promised returns.    In addition, the Investment Company Institute, a trade association of mutual funds, has a lawsuit pending that alleges that Chase is violating federal law barring banks from securities businesses. </TEXT></DOC>
