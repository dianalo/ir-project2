It's just abunch of weeds.&quot;;   &quot;You see weeds. I see a bike tire about to smunch somelettuce.&quot;;   The boys looked down at a patch of umbrella-shaped plants.;  &quot;That's not lettuce,&quot; piped up one of the kids.;   &quot;It doesn't look like thelettuce at Safeway, but California's first gold miners liked eating that plantso much they called it miner's lettuce.&quot;;   &quot;That' s cool. You know any otherfree food?&quot;;   &quot;Well, right behind you is Willy Wonka's chocolate tree.&quot;;  The skeptical looks flooded back.;   &quot;Willy Wonka's chocolate tree, likesure.&quot;;   The 8-year-old ringleader gave a disdainful look and peeled off,followed by most of his buddies. Two stayed behind. I walked over to the tree,pulled off a pod and started chewing on it. When I didn't drop dead on thespot, one of the kids tried a nibble. Suddenly his face lighted up.;   &quot;Ittastes like chocolate!&quot;;   It's often quite a surprise to discover that wildfood grows all over the Santa Clara Valley in vacant lots, old orchards,county-maintained landscaping and alongside trails. To sample nature's bounty,there are several easily recognized wild plants you can pick for the table.Four of them are illustrated here.; Miner's lettuce; The &quot;lettuce&quot; I pointedout to the kids was a plant early California prospectors were fond of.Surviving on coffee, hardtack and beef jerky, miners developed a craving for&quot;greens.&quot; This craving was the body's S.O.S. signal. A vital element wasmissing from their diets. That something was vitamin C. Copying the Indians,prospectors gathered the early spring green known as miner's lettuce (Montiaperfoliata). Unknown to them, miner's lettuce contains vitamin C.;   Miner'slettuce is a good plant for greenhorn foragers because it is easy torecognize. Each stem is capped by a single leaf. Some leaves have the outlineof a serpent's head. Other leaves look like the little umbrellas you get intropical drinks. These circular leaves will eventually be pierced by the stem,which bears inconspicuous white flowers. For the imaginative, the plantresembles a congregation of nodding serpents enjoying the shade offered bygreen umbrellas sporting antennae.;   Miner's lettuce prefers moist soil andcan be found growing in orchards and on the margin of woodlands. Avoidcollecting the plant under oak trees, where it absorbs a bitter taste. It canbe found in vacant fields near Highway 237 and open spaces throughout thevalley. To use the plant, gather leaves and stems. Chop into bite-sizedpieces, add a little oil and vinegar and you have a salad.; Sour grass; Ifthere is a wild plant most kids recognize, it is sour grass (oxalis). Childrenlove to pluck a stalk and suck on its lemony tartness. What kids don't know isthat the plant is bad news if you eat too much. The lemon tartness comes fromoxalic acid, a substance that is toxic in high quantities. Your body canhandle reasonable amounts, but if you see kids putting handfuls of the plantin a blender for a sour grass milkshake, as they've been known to do, you'dbetter step in. Like salt, use it in reasonable quantities. Several stemschopped and added to a wild salad make a nice touch.;   Sour grass has asingle stem the length of a drinking straw, capped by one or morefunnel-shaped flowers. Flower stems arch gracefully from a clump of look-alikeclover leaves. At night and on overcast days, the sunshine-yellow flowersclose. This cheerful weed often pops up in unkempt yards. Freeway medianstrips are another favorite habitat. It is often found growing alongside theice plant.; Carob; It's a big surprise when kids discover my Willy Wonkachocolate trees. Drive down Evelyn Avenue in Sunnyvale, between Wolfe Road andLawrence Expressway or visit the San Jose City College campus, and you willsee nature's version of the Hershey bar hanging from branches.;   Santa ClaraCounty has planted fake chocolate trees all over the valley. These carob trees(Ceratonia siliqua) reach about 20 feet in height. The paired leaves are theshape and size of a 50-cent piece. Stand next to a carob trunk and look upinto the branches for the 5- to 8-inch-long mahogany brown pods. Pods can beeaten right off the tree. Avoid chewing the granite hard seeds. Lest you thinkyou have made a great discovery, the health food industry has been grinding upcarob pods as a chocolate substitute for years.; MUSTARD; Most kids are alsofamiliar with the hotdog's buddy, the mustard plant. The same plant used tomake bottled mustard carpets our hillsides in spring. The sulfur yellow flowerof mustard (Brassica) has four petals arranged like the blades of a propeller.Plants grow waist high with rough textured, hand-sized leaves.;   The seedpods are used to make hotdog mustard, but other parts of the plant are alsoedible. Pluck the flower heads before they blossom. At this stage, they looklike mini- broccolis. Sprinkle these unopened flower heads on a salad for acrunchy mustard zip. You can also use the opened flowers. Gourmet chefssprinkle the yellow petals on soups for culinary color. Try it on your nextbowl.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  JIM WILTENS, Special to Venture  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911219  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  December  </MONTH><PG.COL>  7C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  DRAWING  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  954  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday, December 19, 199100354172,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
