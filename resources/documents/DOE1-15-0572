The fieldwork was carried out by using survey grid with study sites at the intervalsof 100 meters. At each site the cover type, the peat type, the decompositiondegree of peat, and the portion of dead, undecomposed trees in the depositwas determined and recorded. Altogether 468 peat samples were taken tothe laboratory for pH, water content, and ash content determinations.Heating value was determined for 120 samples, sulphur content for 40samples and fusion temperature of the ash for 12 samples. The area of1305 hectars was considered good for fuel peat production. The quantityof usable peat is 24.21 million cubic meters in situ. The energy contentof the usable peat is 48.0 million GJ or 13.3 million MWh as calculatedfor dry peat.</TEXT></DOC>
