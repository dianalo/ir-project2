Timothy Martin knows. As a 32-year-old undercoverinvestigator for the Idaho securities bureau, he has actuallyworked in some of these sleazy shops.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Boiler room&quot; operations -- so named because theytypically operate out of low-rent quarters -- sell preciousmetals, penny stocks, oil and gas partnerships and otherdubious investments over the phone.   Despite claims to investors that they are experts, thesalespeople usually have little or no investment experience.&quot;The people on the phones are not typical con artists,&quot; Mr.Martin says, &quot;just local yokels looking for work.&quot;   But in many boiler room operations, the managers are&quot;definite slime bags&quot; steeped in the scam business, he says.At one operation he infiltrated, a manager had spent threeyears in a California prison for securities fraud.   In pitching investors, the salespeople simply followprepared scripts that tout whatever they are selling as asure winner. But the scripts don't disclose the fat fees andother charges that make profits difficult, if not impossible,for investors to realize.   The deception goes beyond the sales pitch. When onesalesperson seems to have a hot prospect on the phone, theothers gather around and make tradingroom noises to simulatea busy office. Periodically, salespeople put a hand looselyover the telephone mouthpiece and yell as if making trades,Mr. Martin says.   If the prospect on the phone balks, a manager sometimestakes over and &quot;really puts on the pressure,&quot; Mr. Martinsays. Depending on the situation, the manager may assure thecustomer that the firm is trustworthy and his or her accountwould be in good hands -- or he uses intimidation. It's notunusual for boiler-room salesmen to yell and swear at peopleon the phone, calling them idiots for not investing, Mr.Martin says.   In one boiler-room operation, according to the depositionof a former sales representative, one of the principals wouldgrab the phone away from sales rep and begin yelling at thecustomer, often standing atop a desk screaming, kicking andslamming a golf club.   Such tactics are often effective with older people, Mr.Martin says. Older people often are passive and willing tolisten to the sales pitch, he says. And men generally aremore gullible than women, he adds. Having a ripe maleprospect be forced by his spouse to hang up the phone isknown among boiler-room salespeople as &quot;getting wifed.&quot;   Investors aren't the only pigeons, Mr. Martin observes.The salespeople hired by boiler rooms often have to pay alltheir expenses, including a share of the rent, long-distancetelephone charges and even a fee to use the phone for localcalls. In return, they receive 4% to 6% of the gross amountof the sale.   That would be a lucrative arrangement if the boiler room'ssales claims were true. Mr. Martin says he was told in oneemployment interview that he could make $100,000 to $500,000a year in commissions the first year. But he doubts thesalespeople working there made more than $40,000 beforepaying back the expenses.
