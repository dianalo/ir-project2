The 87-year-old Mrs. Bush has a longstanding policy againstinterviews, and even the vice president's plan to show off hislarge clan at the Republican National Convention hasn't changed hermind.   ``She will be here this week. She won't be giving interviews,''said Catherine Holt, a member of the Bush campaign staff.   Nevertheless, insights into the personality of the likely GOPnominee's mother can be found in recent comments and past articleswritten by none other than George Bush.   ``Every mother has her own style. My mother's was a little likean Army drill sergeant's,'' the vice president wrote in a May 1985Mother's Day article for the Greenwich (Conn.) Time.   ``She had five of us to raise _ Pres (Prescott), myself, Nancy,John and Bucky (William) _ and she just felt strongly that therewas too much for us to learn and to do to waste any time on chaos.So we had very little chaos around our house,'' Bush said.   A widow since the 1972 death of her husband, Prescott Bush Sr.,Mrs. Bush lives in Greenwich, the wealthy New York City suburbwhere son George attended schools as a youngster.   In the article, Bush recalled the childhood tennis lessons givenby his mother.   ``I can hear her now: `You can do it. You'll get it. You'll getit.' And she would be patient and tireless and always absolutelysure we would _ eventually _ get it.   ``She also tamed our arrogance. I'll never forget years ago,saying rather innocently, I thought, `I was off my game.' Motherjumped all over me. `You are just learning _ you don't have agame,''' Bush wrote.   Recently, in a CBS News interview, the vice president was askedwhich of his mother's qualities he tries to emulate.   ``Gentleness, caring, sharing,'' Bush responded. ``She tried toinstill in us, through example, not through lecturing, a certainkindness, concern for the other guy _ fairness is a word, I think.   ``Competitive, tough ... I mean she could whip anybody inanything,'' he said.   If Bush succeeds in defeating Democratic nominee MichaelDukakis, Mrs. Bush would be the 12th mother to see her son sworn inas president, the first since January 1977 when Lillian Carterwitnessed her son Jimmy's inauguration.   Miss Lillian became a celebrity in her own right in the Carteryears. That is not expected to happen with Dorothy Bush.</TEXT></DOC>
