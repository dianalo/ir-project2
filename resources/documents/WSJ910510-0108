Working behind the scenes, Democratic leaders are devisinga set of proposals that they can claim will create jobs andassist the unemployed, but also fall within the tightconstraints of last year's budget agreement. The result islikely to be a more limited response to an economic downturnthan has been enacted during past recessions.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;What we're recommending is a minimum&quot; given the &quot;budgetstraitjacket,&quot; said Sen. Donald Riegle (D., Mich.), head ofthe Senate Democrats' anti-recession task force. &quot;I wouldfavor even a bolder approach.&quot;   A trio of bills has emerged as the most probable componentof the anti-recession plan. The first would expandunemployment-compensation benefits. The second would pourmoney into road and bridge construction as part of an alreadyscheduled highway-bill reauthorization. And the third wouldbe an as-yet-unspecified tax cut for middle-income people,which would be offset by tax increases on the wealthy.   The package Sen. Riegle's task force has recommendeddoesn't include a tax reduction, but would bolster somesocial services used by the chronically unemployed such ashomeless shelters and health clinics. His package, which isstill under review, would cost more than $5 billion over twoyears, though the final plan probably will be less expensive.   &quot;There's much more we can do, but we tied our hands withlast year's budget agreement,&quot; said Rep. Richard Durbin (D.,Ill.), a senior member of the House Budget Committee. &quot;Wehave very little ability to respond to significant economicchallenge.&quot;   The highway bill is a priority of President Bush as wellas the Democrats and is expected to become law in some form.Some kind of unemployment-compensation expansion also ispossible, especially if the economy continues deteriorating.The outlook for a tax cut is less certain, though Democraticleaders intend to press the issue strongly, if only forpolitical purposes.   Separately, the House spurned an effort by Republicans tosupport a provision in the Senate-passed budget resolutionfor fiscal 1992 that would make it difficult to raise taxesto pay for expansion of social-spending programs. The 284-132vote increases the chances that the provision, written bySen. Hank Brown (R., Colo.), will be dropped from the finalbudget plan for the year that begins Oct. 1.</TEXT></DOC>
