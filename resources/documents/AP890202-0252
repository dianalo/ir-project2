In fact, the Securities and Exchange Commission _ consideredchronically understaffed and underfunded _ isn't even allowed tospend the money it raises through routine stock licensing fees,which amounted to twice its budget last year.   To put it in perspective, the government agency assigned toinvestigate financial institutions where hundreds of millions ofdollars change handsdaily has a budget of $142.6 million this year.The U.S. military bands are getting $167.5 million.   ``It doesn't hamstring you; you just can't get to the work,''Stanley Sporkin, a U.S. District Court judge in Washington who wasthe SEC's enforcement director from 1974-81, said Wednesday of theagency's budget woes.   ``I didn't believe we were seeing even 10 percent of thewrongdoing that was out there and I think that remains the facttoday,'' Sporkin said.   With the government pledging to increase firepower againstsecurities fraud in the wake of the Drexel case and a commoditiesprobe in Chicago, many officials want to see the SEC receive morefunding, possibly by retaining some of its securities-licensing fees.   ``The problem at the moment is that over the last two to threeyears we got involved in some important investigations _ cases likeDennis Levine, Ivan Boesky, Drexel _ which required the devotion ofour resources,'' current SEC Enforcement Director Gary Lynch said.``Obviously we're not going to take staff away from ongoinglitigation. But right now we are getting hurt.''   The three Wall Street fraud cases Lynch mentioned all producedhuge settlements.   Under Drexel's plea agreement with the SEC made public lastmonth, the investment giant must pay $300 million in criminal finesand civil penalties. The remaining $350 million is to be placed inan escrow account to cover payments to investors who may sue torecover losses from Drexel's actions.   Levine, an ex-Drexel managing director, in June 1986 agreed torepay $11.6 million in illegal gains from insider trading, the useof nonpublic information to profit in stock transactions.   Cooperation by Levine led the SEC to Boesky, the now-imprisonedspeculator who in November 1986 agreed to pay $100 million ininsider trading penalties.   In fiscal 1987, the SEC obtained court orders for defendants toreturn about $121 million in illicit profits. More than $70 millionof that came from insider trading cases. Another $62.6 million wasordered in civil penalties for insider trading.   No one publicly has suggested allowing the SEC to use the moneyit rakes in for government coffers, which would make the agencysomething like a meter maid for securities investigations.   ``It's a real problem because you don't want the agency that isgoing to be using the fines to have an incentive to fine people,''said Sporkin, the federal judge.   Under longstanding guidelines, the SEC has required violators offederal securities laws to ``disgorge,'' or return, illicit profits.   As the number of insider trading cases grew, the SEC pressed forand Congress enacted the Insider Trading Sanctions Act of 1984,which empowered the commission to seek court-ordered fines inaddition to disgorgement.   Some investigators also want the commission to be able to levyfines for relatively minor infractions, rather than just being ableto suspend guilty brokers. Under current guidelines, only judges incivil and criminal cases can fine securities-law violators.   The SEC's $142.6 million budget for fiscal 1989 is up from $135.2million last year. Revenue from securities-registration fees for theyear is projected at $252 million, but as with penalties, the SECcan't spend a cent of it.   That's where change is expected. SEC Chairman David Ruder inDecember proposed that the commission adopt some form ofself-funding, such as retaining part of its fees.   Ruder told a House panel the SEC may have allowed someinvestigations _ including enforcement of fraud in ``penny stocks,''which are traded over-the-counter for a few dollars or less _ toslip because of underfunding and understaffing.   ``Given the current inadequacies of the SEC's resources,(self-funding) makes admirable good sense and I'll be working towardthat end,'' Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the oversightand investigations subcommittee of the House Energy and CommerceCommittee, said Wednesday.   A recent SEC report said the annual turnover rate for staffattorneys is 20 percent and that half of SEC lawyers have less thanthree years' experience. The starting salary for commission lawyersis $27,172.   Ira Lee Sorkin, a former head of the SEC's New York office, saidbureau staffing there fell to 185 in September 1986 from 225 inNovember 1980 _ the same period during which the stock market surgedand insider trading scandals were exposed.   With more staff, he said, ``You'll have more cases, you'll havemore ability to police the industry. Surely it would help.''</TEXT></DOC>
