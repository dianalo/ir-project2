But their first entree -- milk -- is becoming a marketer's nightmare.    Four big drug companies, led by Monsanto Co., plan to introduce separate versions next year of a genetically engineered hormone that boosts cows' milk production by as much as 25%. The companies say their additive, bovine growth hormone, or BGH, is safe, and they have a stable of scientific and medical specialists to back their claim. The Food and Drug Administration is expected to approve BGH early next year. But it may already be too late.    Some of the nation's biggest milk processors and distributors, fearing a consumer backlash, are hastily backpedaling from BGH. Kraft USA, a subsidiary of Philip Morris Cos., and Borden Inc. say they won't handle milk products from test cow herds inoculated with the additive. The nation's largest dairy cooperative, Associated Milk Producers Inc., says its 21,000 farmer members won't use the synthetic hormone on their cows.    Ben andamp; Jerry's Homemade Inc., the Vermont ice cream maker, has gone even further. The company is lobbying against the hormones with anti-BGH symbols imprinted on millions of its ice cream cartons. &quot;Consumers are obviously nervous about this substance,&quot; says a Ben andamp; Jerry's spokesman.    But perhaps most damaging was the announcement last month that four of the nation's largest grocery chains won't be handling milk products from cows that have received BGH in tests. The four chains are Safeway Stores Inc., Kroger Co., Stop andamp; Shop Cos. and Vons Cos. Supermarket officials complain that the drug makers are dumping onto the retailers responsibility for allaying consumers' fears about BGH. The FDA is testing BGH on some 11,000 cows around the country. Milk from the cows, which can't be distinguished from regular milk, is being sold for general consumption. &quot;We don't want our customers or stores being used as guinea pigs,&quot; a Safeway spokesman says, though he adds that Safeway, like the other chains, has no immediate plans to promote its position with customers. An official of Kroger, which has 1,200 stores in 32 states, says: &quot;If they think it's safe, let them step up to the plate and defend it.&quot;    That poses an unusually sticky problem for the makers of BGH, which include Upjohn Co., Eli Lilly andamp; Co. and American Cyanamid Co. Market studies show that just mentioning hormone additives in milk repels many consumers. Worse, consumers are especially wary of pro-BGH messages from drug and chemical companies. A 1986 National Dairy Board study of consumer attitudes toward BGH warns that consumers view those companies as &quot;the archvillains of the food world.&quot;    &quot;This is going to be a horrible problem,&quot; says George Rice, president of GDR Enterprises, a Park Ridge, Ill., marketing consulting firm whose clients include big milk users like International Dairy Queen Inc. Mr. Rice recalls watching a recent television news report on BGH with several clients and their wives. &quot;There was instant sympathy against the drug companies and for the critics,&quot; he says.    Although BGH has become a hot political issue in dairy states such as Wisconsin, Vermont and Minnesota, drug company officials insist they don't see any spreading consumer backlash over the additive. &quot;We don't see consumers rising up en masse and saying, 'We don't want this,'&quot; says James Brezovec, marketing director for Monsanto's dairy products operation. Mr. Brezovec concedes that market studies do show consumers to be &quot;a bit anxious&quot; over biotechnology, but he says those fears will be erased by the FDA's expected approval of BGH and testimonials from scientific and medical specialists.    The four drug companies anticipate that BGH initially will bring in some $500 million in annual sales. Even more important is the fact that milk is the first in a long line of genetically altered food products, from leaner chickens to larger squash, that are planned for market. Monsanto alone already has invested more than $1 billion in biotechnology. &quot;With hindsight,&quot; says Mr. Rice, the marketer, &quot;milk was an awfully poor place to make a beachhead for this technology.&quot;    The drug companies face an unusually complicated problem marketing BGH. In effect, they must sell the synthetic hormone twice: to farmers, who worry that a flood of new milk into a saturated market will cause further economic damage to the dairy industry; and to consumers, who are leery of using synthetic hormones to produce milk, a product long promoted for its purity.    &quot;There are a lot of strikes against the drug companies in this,&quot; says Jack Trout, who heads Trout andamp; Ries, a Greenwich, Conn., marketing strategy firm. Mr. Trout's solution: Sell BGH abroad first. &quot;Remember, 40% of the world is starving,&quot; he says. &quot;Exporting this stuff puts you on the side of the angels.&quot;    If the drug companies must sell BGH here first, Mr. Trout suggests that they avoid any reference to genetic engineering. The term automatically triggers a negative consumer reaction, he says. &quot;The word issue is so critical in the public-relations battle,&quot; Mr. Trout says.    So far, however, the makers of BGH have simply sidestepped consumers in their sales pitch for the synthetic hormone. Instead, they are concentrating on scientific and medical experts who they hope will become surrogates in the battle for consumers' acceptance of BGH. For example, drug company officials have been playing up BGH to the leadership of the American Medical Association for two years, though so far the group hasn't taken a stand. In its 1988 annual report, the Animal Health Institute, a lobbying group for the drug industry, says it distributed fliers on the additive to more than 16,000 doctors and other health professionals. Consumer groups got just 50 fliers.    &quot;The marketing strategy is to get the facts to those whom the consumer will look to for advice,&quot; says Monsanto's Mr. Brezovec. Adds Stephen White, American Cyanamid's manager for BGH: &quot;We have to rely on science and the FDA to ultimately win the day.&quot;    The drug companies apparently have found a sympathetic ear at the FDA. Agency officials have testified before Congress that milk from cows injected with BGH is safe for humans and animals and is &quot;indistinguishable from ordinary milk.&quot; The FDA has cleared the sale of milk from cows getting BGH on a test basis and will decide early next year whether the additive can be sold commercially to dairy farmers.    In its annual report, the Animal Health Institute boasts that Richard Teske and Richard Talbot, both veterinarians and senior officials at the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine, gave speeches to dairy groups last year on the safety of BGH. Both officials are involved in the FDA's review of the additive.    Dr. Teske says it's unusual for FDA officials to speak publicly on products under review by the agency, but the speeches were given to &quot;clear up criticism {of BGH} based on lack of information about FDA's review process.&quot; The BGH makers gave approval for the speeches, he said.    But the companies' strategy backfired at Kraft, where the drug makers have been pitching BGH's merits for two years to Kraft's research department. Kraft's sensitivity to BGH's marketing problems overrode any scientific merits. &quot;This is a market associated with small children,&quot; says Gregory Stroh, Kraft USA's vice president in charge of refrigerated products. &quot;It's very sensitive.&quot;    Not only has Kraft declared that it will avoid milk from cows involved in BGH tests, but like the other companies resisting the additive, Mr. Stroh says Kraft may shun BGH even if it is cleared by the FDA. &quot;We're going to follow our consumers' concerns on this,&quot; Mr. Stroh says. </TEXT></DOC>
