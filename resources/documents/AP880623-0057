The U.S. District Court jury returned the verdict Wednesday andwas to meet today to decide on forfeiture of the $1 million inillegal profits from the deals, which included the shipment of1,300 night-vision goggles to Argentina during the Falkland Islandswar with Great Britain.   The three main defendants _ Solomon Schwartz, 54, of Monsey,owner of Texas Armament Advisors Inc.; Leonard Berg, 52, of NewYork, owner of HLB Security Electronics Ltd.; and Leon Lisbona, 63,of New York, an HLB employee _ were found guilty of all charges.   They were convicted of 13 counts, including racketeering, wirefraud, violations of federal export law, conspiracy and makingfalse statements to a governmental agency. Schwartz and Berg alsowere convicted of obstruction of justice.   The most serious charge, racketeering, carries a maximumsentence of 20 years in prison.   A fourth defendant, Grim DePancicis, 44, of Mount Dora, Fla., anassociate of HLB, was convicted of aiding an illegal export andconspiracy in connection with the Soviet deal but was acquitted ofa charge alleging his involvement in the Argentine shipment.   In that deal, the military equipment was smuggled out of thecountry without a required export license by couriers who hid thegoggles in luggage, prosecutors said.   Another deal involved a shipment of 110 boxes of handguns,shotguns and ammunition that the government contends was destinedfor Iraq but was seized by authorities in Belgium.   A third illegal export was a ``sting'' by the U.S. CustomsService to ship 400 night-vision devices to the Soviet Union. Onesample was smuggled out of the United States without an exportlicense to a post office box in West Germany.   The last deal involved a shipment of 500 automatic rifles,ammunition and other weapons that had an export license for Mexicobut was to go to Poland, the indictment said. The arms were seizedat Kennedy International Airport in February 1984 and thedefendants were charged soon after.   The defendants used two means to arrange the deals, which tookplace between 1982 and 1984, prosecutors said during thethree-month trial: They either did not obtain export licenses asrequired for arms shipments or used licenses for a shipment to alegal destination but had the arms sent elsewhere.   Defense attorneys denied their clients had committed any illegalactions and said that all the transactions were carried out openlybecause the defendants had nothing to hide.   Schwartz testified that the Polish shipment was arranged toestablish routine business dealings in Poland to facilitate thepossible purchase of two Soviet tanks wanted by U.S. intelligenceofficials.   He said he was sought out by the CIA in 1982 and later hadcontact with the Defense Intelligence Agency concerning thepurchase of two Soviet T-72 tanks.   Assistant U.S. Attorney Larry Krantz said the prosecution wasthe first time the federal racketeering statute was used in anillegal arms export case.   He said it was alleged the defendants made about $1 million fromthe four deals.</TEXT></DOC>
