Some saffron-robed Buddhist monks joined in and workers swelledthe ranks as the procession moved toward the western part of thecity, the witnesses said. No violence was reported, unlike studentriots in March and June.   Sein Lwin, a former army general, is widely held responsible forruthless suppression of the March riots, in which up to 100 peoplewere killed.   Rangoon radio, monitored in Bangkok, said the government imposedmartial law to preserve security, safeguard property and allowstudents who so desire to study in peace. It said summary trialsmight be held in some cases.   President Sein Lwin's decree did not say whether a curfew wasput on Rangoon's 3.5 million inhabitants. It said martial law would``cease when the Council of State so declares.''   As read on the official radio, the decree said studentsdemonstrated, delivered speeches and spread pamphlets at Burma'smost sacred shrine, the Shwedagon Pagoda, from July 28 untilTuesday.   ``Today, on 3 August, 1988, about 200 students, joining forceswith some people intent on causing riotous disturbances, madeprotest marches en masse and started disturbances, and a situationarose which regional organs of power can no longer control,'' itsaid.   ``The Council of State has authorized the chief of staff todeclare that a state of emergency exists and to declare martial lawin townships of the Rangoon municipal area.''   Western diplomats reached by telephone in Rangoon providedwitness accounts of 3,000 students marching through the city, facescovered with handkerchiefs, stockings and other masks soauthorities could not identify them. hey reported no violence andsaid police were not in evidence.   One said the marchers ``were very well organized, very peaceful.They would form rings around cars so there would be no damage.''   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley saidthe U.S. Embassy reported no violence or arrests.   Most protesters appeared to be high school students, thewitnesses said.   Diplomats said the march moved along Merchant Street pastdecaying edifices of British colonial days and the newer Americanand Indian embassies, through spacious Maha Bandoola Park andaround centuries-old Sule Pagoda.   According to the reports, most protesters had marched westwardby midafternoon and were joined by large crowds from working-classneighborhoods.   Security forces took over the Shwedagon Pagoda, a traditionalcenter for political agitation, on Tuesday and sealed it off fromstudents, the diplomats said.   On Tuesday, the official News Agency Burma said 100 to 200teen-agers raised the peacock flag, a symbol of Burma's strugglefor independence from Britain, on the base platform of Shwedagon'ssoaring, gold-decked central spire. It urged parents to controltheir children and avoid disturbances.   Foreign journalists have followed developments by telephone andby monitoring official media because of restrictions on their entryto Rangoon, the only legal gateway to Burma for most outsiders.Foreign reporters usually entered the country in the past ontourist visas issued at Burmese embassies.   Virtually all institutions of higher learning were closed afterthe June riots. High schools have remained open, but attendance wasreported low and hours sometimes were shortened.   The emergency decree puts the chief of staff, Burmese usage forthe armed forces commander, in charge of administering justice. Thecurrent commander is Gen. Sau Maung, a close associate of SeinLwin, who delegated martial law authority to Brig. Gen. Myo Nyunt,military chief in Rangoon.   Sein Lwin has admitted that official corruption, waste and``almost deathlike immobility'' have caused a serious loss of faithin the government, according to remarks made available Wednesday.   Speaking Tuesday to the country's top leadership, Sein Lwin alsosaid the government should implement economic reforms dismantlingpart of Burma's rigid socialist system.   He was elected as president and chairman of the ruling BurmaSocialist Program Party last week after the resignation of Ne Win,who had ruled Burma since a coup 26 years ago. Pamphletscirculating in Rangoon have called him a ruthless oppressor andurged that he be overthrown.   Diplomats in Rangoon have said Sein Lwin appears ready to makesome economic reforms while also putting down dissent to robpopular opposition movements of potential leaders.   Those arrested to date include Burma's most respected and vocaldissident, Aung Gyi, and Associated Press correspondent Sein Win.They have been accused of ``attacking the state.''   Louis D. Boccardi, president and general manager, said in aletter to Sein Lwin the AP was ``deeply concerned'' about SeinWin's detention and ``would appreciate further information andclarification of the charges.''</TEXT></DOC>
