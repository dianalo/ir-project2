 Version 2.0 adds some significantenhancements.andM;Users now have the ability to add hyperlinks to documents to referenceimages,andM;annotations, and/or related documents; to build queries  topics) by example;andM;and to support real-time information feeds.andP;  The company also stated that itsandM;SQL-Bridge option, which provides an interface that links Topic with fourandM;popular relational database management systems (Informix, Ingres, Oracle, andandM;Sybase), is now in production.andP;  (See our news coverage in the January OfficeandM;Conputing ReportVol.andP;  12, No.andP;  1-for a description of the initial release ofandM;Topic and the SQLBridge product)andM;Verity recently completed its second round of financing, securing $6.4andM;million to bring the total venture capital investment in the company to $9.4andM;million.andM;HYPERTEXT.andP;  Topic's new HyperLinks feature creates links between a documentandandM;other related objects.andP;  These include images, annotations, and otherandM;documents.andP;  A fink can be inserted anywhere in a document To do this, youmoveandM;to the appropriate location in the document, invoke the menu optionandM;for creating a link, and define the PM of link-annotation, image, document.andM;You are then prompted for the necessary information to complete the link.andO;ForandM;an image, this is the name of the image file.andP;  For a document, it is the nameandM;of the document as well as the location in the document where you want theandM;reader to land when the fink is invoked.andP;  For an annotation, it is the textofandM;the annotation, which becomes a sort of &quot;sticky note&quot; attached to thedocument As is its rule, Topic never modi-andM;fies, reformats, nor moves the original document itself.andP;  The additionalpiecesandM;of information are essentially pointers maintained by Topic.andM;For each link, the user also defines the link text in the originalandM;document.andP;  This entry will appear in square brackets, which is the defaultandM;convention Verity has chosen for displaying links.andP;  For example, enteringandM;note&quot; as the link text means that &quot;note&quot; will be displayed at the linkandM;location, when the original document is viewed within Topic.andP;  Verity callsthisandM;an  icon,&quot;  which is obviously in preparation for future releases of theandM;product.andP;  We would prefer that link locations be more obvious to theandM;user-outlined or highlighted in some way, or actually iconified.andP;  The companyandM;indicated that the appearence of the &quot;icon&quot; is, in fact, customizable by theandM;user.andP;  And on bit-mapped workstation, such as a Sun, it can, in fact, be agraphical icon.andM;Each link can be modified, deleted, or moved to another location in theandM;document There is no facility in this release for operating on multiple linksandM;at once.andM;When the user invokes a link, the linked object is displayed.andP;  If it is aandM;document, it can also have its own links, allowing the user to navigateandM;through a series of documents looking for specific points of interest.andM;Pressing the Escape key pops the user back one step through the chain ofandM;links.andP;  Currently,    you cannot create links in an annotation-a feature wethink would be helpfulandM;as a preface to a link or as a branching mechanism-nor can you search thetextandM;of an annotation.andP;  Another missing feature is a visual map of some kindshowingandM;the connections between objects.andP;  If you build a complex, multilevel linkandM;structure, you can get lost in hyperspace.andP;  However, considering that this isaandM;first implementation in a product where hyperlinks are not the major focus,weandM;are impressed with the direction the company is taking.andM;The database administrator has the option to allow only certain users toandM;create links.andM;IMAGES.andP;  Viewing images obviously requires the appropriate hardware on theandM;workstation (without it, you get an error message).andP;  You can zoom/unzoom anandM;image with the +/- keys as well as pan in all four directions with the allowandM;keys.andP;  Handling images is the company's first step toward incorporatingandM;compound document capability within Topic.andM;The company has developed Image Filters, C programs that allow Topic toandM;access images in the following formats: TIFF, PC-X, Sun Raster, and PDA.andM;These formats have been developed on a customer demand basis, and others willandM;follow.andP;  Topic also supports image compression conforming to standards forCC=andM;levels three and four.andP;  In addition, Verity has defined a Verity ImagefileandM;Format to accommodate other image formats.andM;Another feature of Topic is what the company calls &quot;synchronized im-andM;ages&quot;: A document has an associated image that can be accessed any time theandM;user is viewing the document The user can move between the character-basedandM;version of the document, with its embedded links and highlighted searchandM;words, and an image of the way the actual published document appears.andM;TOPIC-BY-EXAMPLE.andP;  Topic-By-Example is a query-by-example tool, allowing theandM;user to mark up a model document as an example of what would be relevant to aandM;search.andP;  The user highlights the words or phrases of interest, and TopicandM;automatically generates a &quot;topic&quot; from the model document and retrieves theandM;resulting documents (those that are similar in content to the modelandM;document).andP;  At that point, the user can browse through the results andreview,andM;edit, and save the topic.andM;In building the topic, each word or phrase highlighted is given a defaultandM;weight of 0.5.andP;  The only exception is a word/phrase that already has a topicandM;created for it.andP;  In that case, Topic win integrate the existing searchandM;definition and give it a higher weight of 0.7.andM;REAL-TIME CONNECTIONS.andP;  The Topic Real-Time System supports filtering liveandM;documents from dynamic data sources, such as news wires, electronic mailandM;systems, and satellites.andP;  This optional system will have particular appeal toandM;financial analysts, trading operations, and intelligence-gathering and newsandM;services.andP;  As a user, you define the topics (queries) you are interested in,andM;the minimum relevance level a retrieved document must have, and the way youandM;want to be notified that a document has met your requirements.andP;  The latterandM;can include beeping your workstation, sending the document to your E-mailandM;inbox, putting the document in a file, or routing the document to a printer.andM;Topic passes every document coming in through the five feed against itsandM;file of queries, automatically classifying the relevant documents and routingthem to the appropriate users.andM;OTHER NEW GOODIES.andP;  Verity has added some other enhancements and tools tohelpandM;the user in Version 2.0: A thesaurus helps locate synonyms for building moreandM;complete queries; wildcards provide flexibility in searching for partialwordsandM;or phrases; a soundex feature allows for phonetic searches; and a revert&quot; (orandM;undo) function discards all edits to a topic since the last saved version.andM;Once you locate a document with a query, you can search through theandM;document for a type of link or for a string of user-defined words.andM;A level of security above that provided by the native operating system hasalso been added.andP;  The Topic data-andM;base administrator can set up user accounts with passwords assigned tocontrolandM;access at the document level.andP;  If a user does not have permission to see aandM;particular document, Topic acts as if the document doesn't exist for queriesandM;generated by that user.andP;  The administrator can also define groups forsecurityandM;purposes and assign users to one or more groups.andM;APIS.andP;  For VARS, OEMS, and system integrators, Verity provides a developer'sandM;kit with a set of APIs to allow the embedding of Topic text-retrievalandM;functionality within third-party applications.andP;  Currently, this is aimed atandM;developers building vertical applications.andM;The developer's kit costs 70 percent of the full product price and includes aandM;license for run-time versions of Topic.andM;COST AND AVAILABILITY.andP;  Topic 2.0 is scheduled to ship this month.andP;  The TopicandM;Retrieval Client software costs    $695 for the IBM PC and $2,500 forworkstations (e.g., Sun and Digital).andM;Typical installations, including the Topic Database Builder, the DatabaseandM;Server, and Retrieval Client, range from $6,000 to $1 10,000 depending onandM;platforms, configuration, and number of users.andP;  The Topic Real-Time SystemandM;(RTS) option s= at $15,000, and the SQL-Bridge costs $2,500 for integrationandM;with one of the supported RDBMSs.andP;  Topic runs on Digital's VAX/VMS andandM;VAX/Ultrix; Sun3,4, 386i, and SPARCstation I workstations (Unix); MIPSandM;computers (Unix); Pyramid (Unix); SCO (Xenix); and IBM PCs/DOS.andM;Topic is document format-independent and currently supports ASCII,andM;MS-Word, WordPerfect, Interleaf, and FrameMaker document formats.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
