The Massachusetts Civic Interest Council, in a report releasedTuesday, said the Democratic presidential nominee pardoned 232people between 1983 and 1987.   The council, a non-profit, research organization founded andinitially funded by state GOP Chairman Ray Shamie, claims no tiesto the Republican leader. And Bull Purdun, president of thecouncil, said it was not trying to make ``an overall judgment''about Dukakis.   The report showed Dukakis cleared criminal records ranging fromfive cases of manslaughter to 136 cases of breaking and enteringand that 21 of his pardons were granted to people convicted ofselling or possessing with intent to sell drugs.   However, figures provided by the governor's Statehouse pressoffice show that Dukakis has granted fewer pardons than hispredecessors.   Republican governor John Volpe granted 1,324 pardons between1965 and 1968, and GOP Frank Sargent granted 1,755 pardons between1969 and 1974.</TEXT><HEAD>___</HEAD><HEAD>Vice President Dunks Clown at State Fair</HEAD><DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   It took some taunting and several dozen attemptsbefore Vice President George Bush was able to dump a clown into avat of water at the Michigan state fair.   ``Put some power behind it, if you've got anything left,'' saidBozo, the star of a carnival booth called ``Make Bozo Splash.''   The object of Wednesday's game was to hit a small red targetwith a baseball and dump Bozo into the water.   Jacket off, tie loosened in the hot sunshine, the Republicanpresidential nominee valiantly tried to dunk the clown for anaudience of security agents, reporters and his young grandson, SamLeBlond.   ``Gotta get the red, prez,'' Bozo counseled.   The vice president finally connected, sending the clown downwith a left-handed toss.</TEXT></DOC>
