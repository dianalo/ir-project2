Yet the five vaguely wordedparagraphs circulated among Taiwan's foreign bankingcommunity early this month have sparked concern among bankersinvolved in the profitable business of channeling Taiwaneseinvestments abroad.   &quot;Banks must not conduct any business that hasn't obtainedthe relevant central authorities' approval,&quot; the circularstated. While it specifically prohibited only such activitiesas holding seminars on and advertising for deposit-taking andtrust-banking services, the ministry's message has castdoubts on many private-banking activities conducted freely inrecent years.</LP><TEXT>   And because it came on the heels of a recent move bycentral-bank examiners to scrutinize private-banking records,nervous bank executives are trying to discern thegovernment's overall intent.   U.S. bankers in Taipei wonder whether the government isseeking to restrict private banking -- that is, banking donetypically for very wealthy individuals and includinginvestment management services not usually offered inconsumer banks. If that is the government's intent, they say,the policy is bound to create friction in economic relationswith the U.S., which already is pushing Taiwan to liberalizeseveral areas of its banking industry. (Foreign bankersdeclined to be identified in this story for fear ofantagonizing officials they deal with regularly.)   Government officials, however, say the circular isn'tintended to restrict most private-banking activities. Rather,they say their purpose simply is to warn foreign bankers thatcertain recent private-banking promotions are beyond thepale. And some foreign bankers concede that officials'displeasure with some banks may be justified.   Among the recent actions that have attracted theauthorities' ire: ads for Canadian government-approvedemigration funds and mass mailings by banks offeringprivate-banking services.   More broadly, the ministry's warning reflects thegovernment's extreme sensitivity to capital outflows when itis preparing financing for its $300 billion, six-year planfor infrastructure development. Taipei plans to issue hugeamounts of government bonds to fund the program, andofficials want the money now going abroad to be invested athome.   Although Taiwan boasts about $72 billion in foreignreserves, last year the country posted a balance-of-paymentssurplus of only $55 million because of the flow of investmentcapital overseas. In 1989, the surplus was $3.1 billion.   With so much cash flowing out, says one specialist closeto the financial services industry here, authorities haveadopted the position that &quot;if there is a business devoted tothe idea of money leaving, we don't like it.&quot;   In addition to last week's circular, government agencieshave taken several steps this year to reduce capitaloutflows. The central bank has lowered the ceiling onremittances abroad by individuals to $3 million from $5million, and the government has severely restricted themarketing of foreign unit trusts by banks, an action that hashurt the foreign mutual-fund business in Taiwan. Also,analysts say the central bank's tight monetary policy thisyear is aimed partly at keeping funds here. Thus, Taiwan hada $1.66 billion balance-of-payments surplus in the firstquarter, in contrast to a year-earlier deficit of $1.9billion.   Taipei first allowed individuals to invest overseas in1987 in response to foreign criticism of Taiwan's rapidlymounting balance-of-payments surplus. Thus, the government'srecent concern about capital outflows would seem a reversal.   Foreign investment &quot;once was very much encouraged toreduce the embarrassingly high foreign-exchange reserves,&quot;says Josephine Wang, a lawyer in the Taipei office of Chicagolaw firm Baker andamp; McKenzie. &quot;But things have changed over thepast couple of years. Now we want to keep the money here formajor construction and local economic development.&quot;   Government officials deny that last week's circular onprivate banking has anything to do with their concern aboutcapital outflows, and they dismiss foreign bankers' worriesabout a shift in policy.   The Finance Ministry circular was just an annual reminder&quot;to do nothing wrong,&quot; says Samuel Shieh, governor of theCentral Bank of China. &quot;Please tell the foreign bankers notto be too nervous. As long as they earn money based onhonesty, skill and wisdom, nobody will complain.&quot; He alsosays the recent aggressive audits by central bank examiners,which bankers point to as evidence of a less tolerantclimate, aren't unusual.   But in recent months, ministry officials have been given abetter glimpse of some of the services private bankers offerbecause certain banks have become more brazen in theirpromotions. &quot;Many banks have been engaging in this businessfor a long time,&quot; says Chen Jiann-wen, the ministry officialwho wrote the circular. &quot;But recently, they've been doing itin a way that is improper.&quot;   Mr. Chen says one foreign bank recently used a promotionalletter to solicit overseas deposits from large numbers ofpeople. Such an action, a foreign banker says, &quot;in fact ismoving away from real private banking and coming closer toconsumer banking.&quot; This was bound to upset the authorities,bankers say.   An ad campaign by Canadian banks added further fuel to thefire because, as one banker says, it not only encouragedmoney to leave the country, but people as well. UnderCanadian immigration law, foreigners may obtain citizenshipby investing in certain approved funds in specific Canadianprovinces. Chen Jiann-wen says the advertising of these fundsin Taiwan has sparked &quot;a fair degree of concern&quot; ingovernment circles.   Canadian bankers say Taiwan branches of their banksweren't involved with marketing the funds. Rather, they saythe promotions were conducted by bankers in Hong Kong. Butthe Finance Ministry now says it is illegal for banks outsideTaiwan to conduct promotions.</TEXT></DOC>
