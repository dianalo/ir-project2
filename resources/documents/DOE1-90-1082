<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-90-1082 </DOCNO><TEXT>The history of the project and a creation of the PTI cyclotron is describedin connection with its 40th Anniversary (1946-1986). A review is givenof the main results received on the cyclotron such as the productionof microportions of Pu, measured neutron interaction cross-sections witha number of elements and the results of a systematical investigationsof Coulomb excited nuclear levels with the help of various ions (fromHe till Ar) accelerated by the cyclotron. Investigations of a high spinand high energy levels in nuclei with A andless; 100 in nuclear reactions withheavy ions are reviewed. A special attention is paid to the work in anapplied including the development of new semiconductor devices by meansof implantation and application of new techniques for establishing acomposition of superficial layers of various solids.</TEXT></DOC>
