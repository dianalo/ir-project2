It was seen by William Bartram,an early American naturalist, on his first trip to Florida in the springof 1766. He collected a specimen from West of Kanapaha Prairie, AlachuaCounty, (Wunderlin et al. 1980). His well-known <T3>Travels</T3> (published 1791) mentions ``azure fields of cerulean Ixea.''A plate in the book illustrates the plant, which he named <T3>Ixea caelestina</T3> (Harper 1959, pp. 98,99, 360). Harper gave Bartram'slocality as ``quite definitely near the shore of Lake Dexter, Volusia County,''on the St. John's River (p. 360), but Ward (1979) suspected that Bartramhad changed the location for literary effect, since the plant has not sincebeen found south of Palatka, Putnam County, 42 miles to the north. Bartram'sscientific names for plants have been generally accepted as legitimateby botanists since Merrill (1945) defended them.After Bartram, the ixia was misidentified until 1931, when John K. Smallof the New York Botannical Garden, led by a staff member of the Universityof Florida, saw it flowering in pine flatwoods north of Starke, BradfordCounty. Small correctly identified the plant as Bartram's ixia, createda new genus for it, and corrected Bartram's spelling of the specific epithet,resulting in the name <T3>Salpingostylis coelestina</T3> (Small 1931, Ward 1979). Later, a carefulsearch of major herbaria by Foster (1945) turned up several specimens ofBartram's ixia that had been collected in the nineteenth century. Fosterassigned the plant to the genus <T3>Sphenostigma,</T3> making it <T3>Sphenostigma coelestinum.</T3> Goldblatt (1975) retained the speciesin the genus <T3>Sphenostigma.</T3> Since then, the type species of <T3>Sphenostigma</T3> (from Brazil) has been reassigned to the genus <T3>Gelasine,</T3> but other species that had been assigned to <T3>Sphenostigma</T3> do not belong in that genus. Under the code of botanicalnomenclature, the name <T3>Sphenostigma</T3> can no longer be applied to Bartram's ixia (R. Goldblatt,Missouri, Botanical Garden, St. Louis, personal communication, July 1988).Until the taxonomy of this part of the iris family is clarified, Bartram'sixia can be treated as a genus, consisting of only one species, under Small'sname, <T3>Salpingostylis coelestina.</T3><T3>Salpingostylis coelestina </T3>is a perennial herb, about 30 centimeters(1 foot) tall. The bulb is dark brown, with a papery coating, well buriedin the soil. The basal leaves are usually 2 in number, narrowly linear,1.5-3 millimeters wide and 20-30 centimeters long. The flower stalk (scape)rises from the ground and has a spathe with one or two flowers. The flowersusually open at dawn (by 9 a.m. if the morning is cool), usually closingby 11 a.m. (later if the day is cloudy). The flowers are 5 centimetersacross. The six tepals (petals and sepals that look alike) are violet whenthey open, fading to blue before the wilt. The three stamens are shortand bright yellow. The fruit is a capsule. When flowering, no other plantin the southeastern United States can be mistaken for Bartram's ixia. Floweringmay start in April (Ward 1979). In 1987, flowering began by early May,peaked at Memorial Day, and continued sporadically until late June. In1988, cool, dry weather seemingly stretched out the flowering season (Martin1987; Peacock personal communication 1988).Bartram's ixia is native to pine flatwoods, with more or less scatteredpines (usually longleaf, sometimes slash) rising above an understory ofwiregrass (<T3>Aristida stricta</T3>), with other grasses, herbs, and low shrubs.The understory burns readily, and the vegetation is highly adapted to fire.Clewell (1986) uses the term ``firelands communities'' for flatwoods andsimilar fire-dependent vegetation. In the past 30 years, most flatwoodsin northeastern Florida have been converted to dense stands of slash pineplanted for pulpwood.Observation of a Bartram's ixia site where the flatwoods vegetation isintact due to prescribed burning and cattle grazing shows that, under theseconditions, Bartram's ixia flowers the spring after a fire but not in springsfollowing years without fire (Martin 1987). Large number of ixia flowershave been observed in pine plantations where the trees had recently beencut and the ground disturbed by logging equipment. Smaller numbers of flowershave been observed in recently-plowed fire breaks. Since Bartram's ixiaplants do not flower every year under such circumstances, and because theplants are very inconspicuous when not in flower, populations of the ixiamay remain unnoticed until fire, logging, or other disturbance occurs.This limits the accuracy of estimates of the ixia's abundance within itsgeographic range, although the plant's tendency to occur, and to flower,along the edges of road rights-of-way assures that the plant's geographicrange is reasonably accurately known. One roadside that was visited bybotanists in 1979, 1987, and 1988 has had flowering Bartram's ixias eachyear (Wunderlin et al. 1980; Marin 1987; Peacock personal communication1988).Bartram's ixia occurs in a limited geographic area between Jacksonville,St. Augustine, and Gainesville, Florida, including southern Duval County(where the plant appears to be nearly extirpated), northern St. Johns Countywest of Interstate 95, Clay County, Putnam County north of Palatka, BradfordCounty north of Starke, and Baker County south of Interstate 10 (Martin1987). Within its range, Bartram's ixia is restricted to pine flatwoodsvegetation. Bartram's ixia appears to be especially characteristic of soilswith the water table at or near the surface during the winter. At one sitewhere the native vegetation is intact, the ixia is restricted to the grassymargins of shallow depressions, where it occurs with the purple pitcherplant (<T3>Sarracenia purpurea</T3>), wiregrass, and <T3>Aletris </T3>(a member of the lily family). Small populations of Bartram'sixia occur along the grassy edges of rights-of-way of paved roads, usuallywith <T3>Aletris, Calopogon</T3> orchids, and other plants of wet areas (Martin1987; Peacock personal communication 1988).Herbarium specimens and observations (Ward 1979, Wunderlin et al. 1980)indicate that as pine flatwoods have been converted to dense pine plantations,and as fire suppression has become increasingly prevalent and effective,flowering Bartram's ixia plants have become fewer. Some site preparationmethods associated with forestry (bulldozing, root raking, bedding, chopping)are likely to destroy or damage Bartram's ixia plants (Kral 1983). It ispossible that the shady conditions of maturing pine plantations are notfavorable to the ixia. This is certainly the case for other fire-adaptedmembers of the pineland flora (Clewell 1986).Section 12 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 directed the Secretaryof the Smithsonian Institution to prepare a report on plants consideredto be endangered, threatened, or extinct. This report, designated as HouseDocument No. 94-51, was presented to the Congress on January 9, 1975. Inthis report, Bartram's ixia, under the name <T3>Sphenostigma coelestina </T3>(sic), was considered threatened. On July1, 1975, the Service published a notice in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(40 FR 27823) of its acceptance of the reportas a petition in the context of section 4(c)(2) (now section 4(b)(3)) ofthe Act, as amended, and of its intention to review the status of the planttaxa contained within. On December 14, 1980, the Service published a noticeof review for plants (45 FR 82480), which included <T3>Sphenostigma coelestinum </T3>as a category 2 candidate (a taxon forwhich data in the Service's possession indicate listing is possibly appropriate).A notice of review published on September 27, 1985 (50 FR 39526) maintained<T3>Sphenostigma coelestinum </T3>as a category 2 candidate. The proposalto list this species as endangered is based on the information availablein 1980, augmented by searches for the plant carried out by Martin (1987),with all sites revisited at least once by him in 1988, and by Peacock (personalcommunication 1988).Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Act, as amended in 1982, requires the Secretaryto make findings on certain pending petitions within 12 months of theirreceipt. Section 2(b)(1) of the 1982 Amendments further requires that allpetitions pending on October 13, 1982, be treated as having been newlysubmitted on that date. This was the case for <T3>Sphenostigma coelestinum, </T3>because the Service had accepted the1975 Smithsonian report as a petition. In October of 1983, 1984, 1985,1986, 1987, and 1988, the Service found that the petitioned listing ofthis species was warranted but precluded by other listing actions of ahigher priority, and that additional data on vulnerability and threatswere still being gathered. Publication of the present proposal constitutesthe final finding that is required.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Factors Affecting the Species</ITAG>Section 4(a)(1) of the Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 <T3>et seq</T3>.) and regulations (50 CFR Part 424) promulgated to implementthe listing provisions of the Act set forth the procedures for adding speciesto the Federal lists. A species may be determined to be endangered or threateneddue to one or more of the five factors described in Section 4(a)(1). Thesefactors and their application to <T3>Salpingostylis coelestina</T3> (Bartram) Small (=<T3>Sphenostigma coelestinum</T3> (Bartram) Foster) (Bartram's ixia) areas follows:A. <T3>The present of threatened destruction, modification, or curtailmentof its habitat or range</T3>. Bartram's ixia is restricted to pine flatwoodsin northeastern Florida. Similar habitat elsewhere in Florida and othersoutheastern States lacks the ixia. In the past 30 years, nearly all ofthe flatwoods in northeast Florida have been converted to pine plantation,with densely planted slash pine. When the trees mature, there is littleunderstory vegetation. Planted pine stands are burned only occasionally,if at all. Additionally, ditching and site preparation methods such asbedding now allow the successful planting of pines on sites that previouslywould have been too wet. Clewell (1986) noted that some of the understoryplants characteristic of flatwoods persist under the first crop of pinesto be planted on a site, but that ``in subsequent rotations, these residualplants will be much less important or entirely absent.'' Clewell drew onthree studies of pine plantations within the range of Bartram's ixia, althoughnone was known to have this plant. The discovery of flowering populationsof flowering Bartram's ixia in two recently cut-over pine plantations in1988 shows that the plant can persist under the first crop of pines; however,experience with other species of the same habitat indicates that the ixiawill almost certainly decline after the sites are replanted with pines(Clewell 1986).Some sites that once had populations of Bartram's ixia have been convertedto pastures, where the plants do not persist, or to miscellaneous landuses. Near Starke, a junkyard displaced a site that had been visited bySmall (Wunderlin et al. 1980).The growth of the Jacksonville metropolitan area is a threat to Bartram'sixia. The plant was collected in the Mandarin section of Duval County (Jacksonville)in 1960, but this area is now almost entirely residential. Bartram's ixiais still fairly abundant along paved roads in northwestern St. Johns Countysouth of Jacksonville, but this area will almost certainly be developedfor residential and commercial purposes. Four residential/mixed use developmentslarge enough to require approval through Florida's Development of RegionalImpact (DRI) process have been proposed for this area already. These projectsmight house as many as 143,000 people within 20 years (``Jacksonville Times-Union'',August 21, 1988). The ixia is also locally abundant in remnant flatwoodsaround Middleburg and Orange Park in Clay County, southwest of Jacksonville.These areas are growing very rapidly with an estimated 32.3 percent increasein population from 1982 to 1987 (Moore 1988). A proposed Jacksonville outerbeltway to connect Interstate 95 to Interstate 10 through St. Johns andClay Counties will pass through these rapidly developing areas, possiblyfurther accelerating growth.B. <T3>Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educationalpurposes</T3>. Not applicable at the present time. Since this plant hasbulbs, it may be vulnerable to attempts to bring it into cultivation orto ``rescue'' it from the wild.C. <T3>Disease or predation</T3>. None apparent.D. <T3>The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms</T3>. Bartram's ixiais listed as threatened (as <T3>Sphenostigma coelestinum</T3>) by the Preservation of Native Floraof Florida Act (section 581.185-187, Florida Statutes), which regulatestaking, transport, and sale of plants but does not provide habitat protection.The Endangered Species Act will offer additional protection through sections7 and 9, and through recovery planning.E. <T3>Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence</T3>.The restricted geographic range of this plant, combined with extensivealteration of its habitat, increases the risks posed by the preceding fourfactors, making it likely that the species could become extirpated throughoutmost of its range in the absence of organized conservation efforts.The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial informationavailable regarding the past, present, and future threats faced by Bartram'sixia in determining to propose this rule. Based on this evaluation, thepreferred action is to list Bartram's ixia as endangered. Its limited geographicrange, combined with alteration of nearly all of its habitat, the nearcertainty that existing populations on road edges will diminish, and theexpansion of the Jacksonville urban area indicate that the species is indanger of extinction in a significant portion of its range, and thereforefits the Act's definition of endangered.<ITAG tagnum="84">Critical Habitat </ITAG>Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that to the maximum extentprudent and determinable, the Secretary designate any habitat of a specieswhich is considered to be critical habitat at the time the species is determinedto be endangered or threatened. The Service finds that designation of criticalhabitat is not prudent for Bartram's ixia at this time. Federal agenciescan be alerted to the presence of this species without the publicationof critical habitat descriptions and maps. Because Bartram's ixia is aconspicuous plant when in flower, publication of critical habitat descriptionsand maps might increase the threat from taking or vandalism. Designationof critical habitat affects only Federal agencies. No Federal agenciesmanage land with Bartram's ixia. Navy facilities in Jacksonville, at theedge of the plant's range, were searched, but no ixias were found (Martin1987).<ITAG tagnum="84">Available Conservation Measures </ITAG>Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatenedunder the Endangered Species Act include recognition, recovery actions,requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain practices.Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actionsby Federal, State, and private agencies, groups, and individuals. The Actprovides for possible land acquisition and cooperation with the Statesand requires that recovery actions be carried out for all listed species.Such actions are initiated by the Service following listing. The protectionrequired of Federal agencies and the prohibitions against taking are discussed,in part, below. Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluatetheir actions with respect to any species that is proposed or listed asendangered or threatened and with respect to critical habitat, if any isbeing designed. Regulations implementing this interagency cooperation provisionof the Act are codified at 50 CFR Part 402. Section 7(a)(4) requires Federalagencies to confer informally with the Service on any action that is likelyjeopardize the continued existence of a proposed species or result in destructionor adverse modification of proposed critical habitat. If a species is subsequentlylisted, section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to ensure that activitiesthey authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the continuedexistence of a listed species or to destroy or adversely modify its criticalhabitit. If a Federal action may affect a listed species or its criticalhabitat, the responsible Federal agency must enter into formal consultationwith the Service. The currently known sites for Bartram's ixia are on private land and highwayrights-of-way. The Florida Department of Transportation is aware of theapproximate locations of the populations of the ixia along its highways,and knows the precise location of the best such population. The populationsof Bartram's ixia on State-owned rights-of-way may be subject to Federalinvolvement if the U.S. Department of Transportation (Federal Highway Administration)should provide funds for maintenance or construction. The Florida Departmentof Transportation is aware that construction of an outer beltway for Jacksonvillecould affect the plant; at the present time, no Federal funding is plannedfor the project. Bartram's ixia may eventually be found to occur on CampBlanding, which is operated by the Florida National Guard. Federal mortgageprograms may be subject to section 7 review, including those of the U.S.Department of Agriculture (Farmers Home Administration), Veterans Administration,and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (Federal HousingAdministration loans). The supply of electricity to new housing developmentsmay be subject to Federal involvement through Rural Electrification Administrationfunding. The Act and its implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.61, 17.62,and 17.63 set forth a series of general trade prohibitions and exceptionsthat apply to all endangered plants. All trade prohibitions of section9(a)(2) of the Act, implemented by 50 CFR 17.61, would apply. These prohibitions,in part, make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction ofthe United States to import or export any endangered plant, transport itin interstate or foreign commerce in the course of a commercial activity,sell or offer to sell it in interstate or foreign commerce, or remove itfrom areas under Federal jurisdiction and reduce it to possession. In addition,for listed plants the 1988 amendments (Pub. L. 100-478) to the Act prohibittheir malicious damage or destruction on Federal lands, and their removal,cutting, digging up, or damaging or destroying in knowing violation anyState law or regulation, including State criminal tresspass law. Certainexceptions can apply to agents of the Service and State conservation agencies.The Act and 50 CFR 17.62 and 17.63 also provide for the issuance of permitsto carry out otherwise prohibited activities involving endangered speciesunder certain circumstances. The Service anticipates few requests for permitsbecause there is currently no known commercial trade in Bartram's ixia.Requests for copies of the regulations on plants and inquiries regardingthem may be addressed to the Office of Management Authority, U.S. Fishand Wildlife Service, P.O. Box 27329, Central Station, Washington, DC 20038-7329(202/343-4955).<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comments Solicited </ITAG>The Service intends that any final action resulting from this proposalwill be as accurate and as effective as possible. Therefore, any commentsor suggestions from the public or other concerned governmental agencies,the scientific community, industry, or any other interested party concerningany aspect of this proposal are hereby solicited. Comments particularlyare sought concerning:  (1) Biological, commercial trade, or other relevant data concerning anythreat (or lack thereof) to <T3>Salpingostylis coelestina; </T3>(2) The location of any additional populations of this species and thereasons why any habitat should or should not be determined to be criticalhabitat as provided by Section 4 of the Act;(3) Additional information concerning the range and distribution of thisspecies; and(4) Current or planned activities in the range and habitat of this speciesand their possible impacts on it.Final promulgation of the regulation on <T3>Salpingostylis coelestina </T3>will take into consideration the commentsand any additional information received by the Service, and such communicationsmay lead to adoption of a final regulation that differs from this proposal.The Endangered Species Act provides for a public hearing on this proposal,if requested. Requests must be filed within 45 days of the date of theproposal. Such requests must be made in writing and addressed to the FieldSupervisor, Jacksonville Field Office, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,3100 University Boulevard South, Suite 120, Jacksonville, Florida 32216.<ITAG tagnum="84">National Environmental Policy Act</ITAG>The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment,as defined under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Actof 1969, need not be prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuantto section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. A noticeoutlining the Service's reasons for this determination was published inthe <T4>Federal Register </T4>on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244).<ITAG tagnum="84">References Cited</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Clewell, A.F. 1986.
