(1) In the main combustion part, the turbulence field was almostuniformly isotropic; therefore, the effective turbulent degree was predicted.(2) The flame motion lost its intensity after the middle point of combustionwithout swirl. When swirl was intensified in the deep combustion chamber,the velocity in the tangential direction increased at the middle pointof combustion and the irregularity in flame motion was increased. (3)Swirl is considered to intensify the turbulence of the latter periodof combustion and to promote the mixing of fuel and air. (12 figs, 2tabs, 7 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
