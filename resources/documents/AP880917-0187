On a single mile per gallon, to hear the interested parties tellit, hangs the U.S. trade balance, the ability of the domestic autoindustry to compete, the nation's energy independence, thousands ofhighway traffic deaths, even the capacity of the Earth's climate tosupport humankind.   A welter of comment offered at hearings this past week lead tothose assorted conclusions. It now falls to the National HighwayTraffic Safety Administration to weigh those competing interestsand issue a decision on where fuel consumption standards ought tobe set in the future.   In many respects, fuel economy is a 1970s issue hitching a rideon the concerns of the 1980s and the 1990s.   Beginning in 1972, oil producing nations, mainly in the MiddleEast, raised oil prices dramatically. Congress in 1975 respondedwith legislation to reduce the nation's reliance on foreign oil byforcing Detroit to build more fuel-efficient cars.   The law phased in a minimum gas mileage each manufacturer onaverage must attain. The corporate average fuel economy _ shortenedto CAFE and pronounced like a small eatery _ is calculated on thebasis of gallons of gasoline used by a maker's domestic carproduction over the estimated life of the vehicles.   The CAFE standard in 1985 reached 27.5 mpg. The next year it waslowered to 26 mpg by the National Highway Traffic SafetyAdministration after some of the automakers argued that, fortechnological and commercial reasons, they could not meet thestricter standard.   The standard was scheduled to revert to 27.5 mpg with the 1989model year. NHTSA in August proposed setting the CAFE standardthrough 1990 somewhere between 26.5 mpg and 27.5 mpg.   General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. oppose setting thestandard at the higher end of the range. They said they could livewith a 26.5 mpg standard, but the question is one of trade and jobs.   To meet a 27.5 mpg CAFE standard, the two largest U.S.automakers said they would have to restrict production of largecars.   The result, they said, would be layoffs at large-car assemblyplants. The job losses would cascade through the manufacturers'suppliers and into the general economy, ultimately numbering in thehundreds of thousands.   Analysts buy the argument that the stricter fuel-economystandard would pinch GM and Ford.   ``I think you would have more problems, because Americans wantto buy horsepower and big cars,'' said David Healy, an analyst withthe New York brokerage house Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. ``Itprobably wouldn't be a disaster; it would be more of a pain for thecompanies than it is now.''   A pain for GM and Ford would be a boon for the foreignautomakers, particularly the Japanese, and detrimental to the U.S.balance of trade, both the automakers and analysts said.   Large and luxury cars accounted for about 19 percent of the 5.2million domestic cars sold in the United States this year throughAugust, according to industry reports.   All but one of those models were made by GM and Ford. Chryslermakes one big car. Most imported cars are smaller vehicles.   Even if the U.S. makers restricted big-car production, theywould still make some of the high-profit vehicles, thereby dilutingthe average gas mileage of their fleets.   To offset that production, ``they have to have a lowerperformance (small) car than the importers, because the importersdon't have to balance their small cars aginst the higher fuel-usagecars,'' said Thomas O'Grady, president of Integrated AutomotiveResources Inc. of Wayne, Pa.   Therefore, even buyers of small cars would tend to gravitate tohigher-performance imported vehicles.   Against that bread-and-butter question lie other issues, somedivorced from the orginal conservation intent of the law.   Some want CAFE loosened to lower the highway death toll. TheCompetitive Enterprise Institute, a free-market advocacy group,argued that setting the standard at 27.5 mpg would lead to between2,200 and 3,900 additional deaths over the life of 1989 carsbecause people are more likely to be killed in crashes involvingsmaller vehicles.   Others want the mileage standards tightened in order to protectthe environment. The Energy Conservation Coalition, a group of 20environmental and conservation grups, argued that loosening theCAFE standard, by putting more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere,would accelerate the greenhouse effect, a warming of the atmospherecaused by a trapping of the sun's heat, with disastrous effects forworld's food-growing ability in the next century.   The Department of Transportation, GM and others point togasoline prices averaging 97 cents per gallon, far lower thanforecast during the height of the oil crunch, and say the law hasoutlived its original intent and should be scrapped.   Still others, such as the Center for Auto Safety, a consumersgroup often critical of the auto industry and its regulators, saythe conservation issue is still important, with oil importsstanding at 38.1 percent this year, against 36.8 percent when theCAFE law was passed. A new energy crisis, they argue, is somethingfor which the nation should be prepared.   The CAFE decision, the conflicting comment suggests, is aquestion of public priorities, a balance between the economichealth of the auto industry and broader political, safety andenvironmental concerns. A ruling is expected within a few weeks.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
