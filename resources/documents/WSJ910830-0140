Boosters of the Electronic Data Gathering Analysis andRetrieval system say that's good news for investors, who willfind it much easier to get timely information about publiccompanies.</LP><TEXT>   This fall the SEC plans to publish a timetable tellingsome 11,500 public companies when they must stop using paperto file their annual reports, prospectuses and other requireddisclosures, and when they must instead start sending theinformation electronically to the SEC's computers.   Under that timetable the 225 companies now filing on anEdgar pilot program will be moved to the new permanent systemearly next year. Another 800 to 1,000 new companies shouldcome on line by next fall. The SEC plans to continue addinggroups of companies to the system each quarter untilmid-1995, at which point it hopes to be receiving most of itsfilings on Edgar, says John Penhollow, director of the Edgarproject.   Computerizing the SEC's paper filing system is a mammothtask, and Edgar has been plagued by political problems,technical glitches and cost overruns for years. In themid-1980s, Edgar had become so unpopular on Capitol Hill thatone member of the House Energy and Commerce Committeesuggested renaming the project Mr. Ed, &quot;since the SEC has amuch better chance of finding a talking horse than it does ofachieving an efficient computer filing system.&quot;   In 1989, the SEC awarded a $52 million multiyear contractto further develop Edgar to BDM Corp, a unit of Ford MotorCo.   But supporters of Edgar say it is worth the trouble.Nowadays the SEC is being hit by a tidal wave of paper,receiving some 700,000 paper filings every year, amounting toabout five million pieces of paper. Those documents arewarehoused in the SEC's crowded public reference room, whereinvestors, journalists and financial research organizationsroutinely comb through stacks of file folders in search ofhot documents -- and don't always find them.   The Edgar system will make those documents availablenationwide through a data base maintained by Mead Corp.'sMead Data Central unit, one of the project's subcontractors.In addition to offering Edgar through its Lexis and Nexisservices, Mead will sell access to the Edgar database to thepublic at fees regulated by the SEC. The agency plans tocontinue to make filings available at its public referencerooms here and in Chicago and New York, except that in thefuture, researchers will use Edgar terminals rather thansearch through library shelves.   Starting at a minimum subscription of $36,000 a year --and that's just for access to filings by companies traded onthe New York Stock Exchange -- Mead's Edgar data base will betoo expensive for most individual investors. But the SECexpects brokerage firms, news organizations and otherinformation providers to subscribe to Mead's data base andresell the information to their customers. Edgar filingscan't be copyrighted, so there is no limit on the way theinformation can be repackaged and resold. Jim McGrane,general manager of Mead Data Central's Edgar project, says atsome point in the future even public libraries might provideaccess to Edgar through dedicated terminals.   SEC officials contend Edgar will be a boon both for theagency and for public companies by reducing the time it takesto review and approve proposed securities transactions, theSEC says.   Robert Folbigg, comptroller for General Motors Corp.'sGeneral Motors Acceptance Corp., which has been filing on theEdgar pilot program for several years, reports that Edgar hassubstantially reduced the amount of time it takes to get SECapproval for GMAC deals. &quot;Things that would take three dayswe can now do in one day,&quot; he says. He adds that Edgar alsolets GMAC make changes to public documents up until the SEC'sfiling deadline, because documents can be filed simply bypushing a button.   Indeed, in most cases documents will be available to Edgarsubscribers within minutes after they are filed with the SEC.Mr. Penhollow acknowledges that companies will be able todelay filing sensitive documents until after the marketcloses, but says Edgar will close the lag time it now takesfor such filings to get to the SEC's public reference room.He adds that companies won't be able to sneak something induring the middle of the night, since documents must betransmitted by 5:30 p.m. EDT to meet the SEC's filingdeadlines. That's the same deadline the SEC currently has forpaper filings.   Robert Buckholz, vice president of global network supportfor Bowne andamp; Co., a major financial printer, says mostcompanies should be able to adapt to Edgar, but believes --and hopes -- some may turn to outside contractors such as hiscompany for help with complicated filings. &quot;Some companieswill try to do it internally, some will go to serviceproviders, but for the great majority, it will be a mix,&quot; hesays.   Edgar won't make financial printers obsolete, Mr. Buckholzsays, because companies will still need paper to market theirsecurities. While Edgar will enable companies to meet theSEC's disclosure requirements, he argues that &quot;it's theprinted prospectus with color photos that's going to sell thedeal.&quot;   Mr. Folbigg, of GMAC, agrees that small companies shouldbe able to convert from paper to electronic filing withoutmuch trouble. &quot;The key to the Edgar system is a goodsecretary who can follow instructions,&quot; he says. GMAC doesits filings via a personal computer.   Indeed, some small companies are eager to start filingelectronically. Robert Knowles, chief financial officer forSandamp;K Famous Brands Inc., a men's clothing retailer inRichmond, Va., that had $67 million in sales last year, saysEdgar &quot;seems relatively simple,&quot; and wants to find out whenhis company can log on. &quot;Somebody needs to take the bull bythe horns at the {Securities and Exchange} Commission andtell filers, this is when you're in&quot; the system, he says.   Mr. Penhollow, director of Edgar, hopes publishing thetimetable will do just that. &quot;I'm anxious to get these rulesout,&quot; he says. &quot;Only at that time will companies becompletely convinced that this thing is going to happen.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
