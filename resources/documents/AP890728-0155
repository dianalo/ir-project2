Asked if that meant he might sign the bill, Bush said, ``Ididn't say that.''   The House Judiciary Committee on Thursday approved aDemocratic-sponsored criminal statute with a year in jail and anunspecified fine for people who burn flags.   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., and others argue that aregular statute could overcome the Supreme Court ruling that flagburning was a protected form of political protest. A constitutionalamendment, they argue, could erode First Amendment rights.   Bush told reporters Friday the amendment he supports iscarefully drawn, so he isn't worried about infringing on the FirstAmendment.   ``I don't have disrespect for those who want to find a differentanswer,'' he said. It was ``heartening ... that there's a widearray of support for doing something about this question,'' he said.   The president's words seemed to downplay the political battle inCongress between supporters of the amendment and of the statute.But the president's political operatives are working to use theissue against Democrats who oppose his amendment by painting themas somehow unpatriotic.   House Republican Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., said Thursday thatWhite House Chief of Staff John Sununu urged GOP leaders this weekto speak out because the flag amendment was a ``wedge issue'' _ onethat divides and troubles Democrats.   Foley said Friday he found it troubling that ``they want to takethe respect that Americans have for the flag and twist it into apolitical issue.''</TEXT></DOC>
