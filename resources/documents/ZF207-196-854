 Hehas to.andP;  As a media consultant and software developer, he uses five phonelines to keep his two home-based businesses running.andP;  It's not unusual tofind Burns putting a contractor on hold on one line, talking to a client onanother, and sending out a fax or computer file on yet a third.andP;  And whenthings get really busy, he preempts two other lines that normally serveanother part of the house.andM;To control this elaborate setup, Burns custom-built a wiring switchbox in hisbasement, a feat that drew on his previous experience in the U.S.andP;  ArmySignal Corps.andP;  These skills will serve him well as the phone system continuesits evolution.andM;But most people are not so lucky.andP;  Since the ATandamp;T breakup in 1984, bewilderedphone subscribers have found themselves purchasing phone equipment, selectinglong-distance carriers, and making tricky wiring adjustments.andP;  And theincreasing use of modems and fax machines means that people are using theirphones for more than just ordering Chinese food.andM;In the near future, the challenge will increase as advances in communicationtechnology present a wealth of new improvements and services, including theability to reliably send data at speeds up to 30 times as fast as thosepossible with today's 2,400-bit-per-second modems.andP;  New PC products will makethe most of these future capabilities.andM;The changes were inevitable.andP;  Much of today's vital communications travelthousands of miles at high speed over modern fiber-optic highways, until theyhit the local telephone off-ramp and encounter the electronic equivalent of abanana republic with unpaved roads.andP;  Local phone networks often consist ofantiquated call-switching equipment and low-speed, interference-prone copperwires, even though phone companies are upgrading with newer technologies suchas computerized switching equipment and fiber-optic wires.andM;The Ghost of Telephony PastandM;On a quiet street in residential Boylston, Massachusetts, an hour outsideBoston, sits an unmarked cottage.andP;  Inside is a mechanical relic of the daysbefore the transistor.andP;  Philip rock, a New England Telephone manager, entersa code on a cipher lock and opens  the door to a single room that sounds likea clock factory.andP;  Inside is one of the oldest local telephone switches stillin use, dating back to the 1920s.andP;  Slated for replacement on December 8,1990, this office serves over 1,500 phone numbers in eastern Massachusetts.andO;&quot;This is where you can really see how telephony works,&quot; Rock says.andP;  He shouldknow--he oversees the conversion of mechanical central office switches likethis one to state-of-the art computerized systems.andM;Eighteen hundred copper pairs (one for each telephone number, plus spares)enter this room bound in large cables and separate out onto single pins onold-fashioned circuit boards.andP;  Then they connect to the noisy mechanicalrelays mounted on metal cases throughout the room.andP;  When a caller dials anumber, a metal contact clicks across a matrix of other contacts until itreaches the one for the correct phone number.andM;Nostalgia aside, these mechanical switches spell trouble for phonesubscribers who need reliable connections for their dial-up PC or faxcommunications.andP;  Fortunately, in a bid to prevent business customers fromswitching over to private services--and to comply with certain legalrequirements of the ATandamp;T breakup--the local phone companies (the &quot;Baby Bels&quot;)are rapidly replacing these old switches with state-of-the-art digitalsystems.andM;The new switches, essentially room-size computers running under operatingsystems such as ATandamp;T's Unix, are completely programmable and can handle up to100,000 phone lines.andP;  To make changes to subscribers' lines, a phone companyemployee enters commands at a terminal.andP;  (Changing a line on the oldmechanical switches required an employee to physically rearrange wires andpins.)andM;For the future, researchers from ATandamp;T and the local companies are developingprototypes of so-called broadband switches, which will allow the phone systemto route video as well as audio signals.andP;  Although the cost of theelectronics required to send video is prohibitive, prices should drop sharplyin the mid-1990s as the technology improves.andM;Enlightenment Through OpticsandM;In addition to upgrading the call-switching systems, local phone companiesare replacing thw wires that carry the calls.andP;  Copper wire that carriesanalog signals is being removed to make way for fiber-optic cable that canhandle digital signals.andP;  This is good news for modem users, because datalosses are usually caused by interference in the analog copper-wire portionof the local phone network.andP;  Because copper wires communicate electrically,they're prone to interference from outside sources such as radio waves.andP;  Inaddition, analog signals tend to be less reliable than digital ones.andM;The enormous digital carrying capacity of fiber-optic cable makes it thelogical candidate to eventually become the single integrated informationpipeline.andP;  Recent laboratory tests have clocked hair-thin strands of fiber at27 gigabits (billion bits) per second--the equivalent of 400,000 simultaneousphone calls and enough to carry hundreds of video channels, high-fidelityaudio conversations, and extra-large computer files all at once.andP;  As theelectronics that drive fiber improve, this capacity will increase.andM;But fiber-optic cable is no panacea.andP;  Currently, its enormous capacity isoverkill for many situations.andP;  Another problem is the cost.andP;  Fiber-opticcable is relatively cheap, but the electronics required to run it are not.andO;More importantly, replacing all of the existing copper wire with fiber wouldbe a logistical and financial nightmare.andM;Nevertheless, the phone companies have been stringing fiber directly tobusinesses for about two years and are pushing ahead with carefully chosenfiber-to-home trials.andP;  In Heathrow, Florida, a new development complex nearOrlando, homeowners have begun receiving phone service from Southern Belldirectly over fiber.andP;  Starting this summer, they will receive cable TVservice over the same fiber.andM;The phone companies claim that within a couple of years they will beinstalling fiber instead of copper in new construction developments.andP;  To doso, they will have to convince state regulators that installing andmaintaining the fiber won't cost any more than using copper--a dubious claim,according to some regulators.andM;The phone companies will also face stiff political opposition from cable TVvendors, who want to preserve their exclusive video franchises.andP;  This fighthas already begun in Congress.andM;Copper's Last StandandM;Because no one really knows when--if ever--fiber optics will reach all theway to phone subscribers' doorsteps, the lowly copper wire is today bracingfor one last technological stand.andP;  Dozens of companies, from modemmanufacturers to consumer electronics makers, are searching for better waysto compress data and pack more information onto existing copper lines.andP;  Moreimportantly, the Baby Bells are working on a plan to eliminate the low-speedanalog leg of the local phone network without replacing the existing copperwiring.andM;The phone companies' plan, the integrated services digital network (ISDN), isfinally coming on-line after ten years of international infighting overstandards.andP;  (For more on ISDN, see &quot;The Cult of ISDN,&quot; PC/Computing, April.)andO;By modifying central office switches and prescribing a new type of interfacefor customer equipment, the scheme aims to replace the tangle of wiressprouting from telephones, PCs, fax machines, alarm systems, andother deviceswith just one integrated wire.andP;  Transmission speeds will drastically increaseto a rate of 64 kilobits per second--almost seven times as fast as today'stop speed of 9,600 bps.andM;These higher speeds should enable ISDN subscribers with the right equipmentto send letter-quality faxes, near-CD-quality audio, and perhaps evenlow-quality video images.andP;  And because data and voice communications will bedigitally interwoven and synchronized by the ISDN system, a whole range ofnew data-oriented capabilities will become practical, including &quot;sketchphones&quot; that allow users on opposite ends to draw diagrams for each other,remote LAN access, remote utility meter reading, home monitoring of hospitaloutpatients, and telemetry (&quot;Turn on the air conditioner, HAL, I'll be homein 20 minutes&quot;).andM;After years of uncertainty and delay, computer and modem manufacturers arefinally starting to design equipment that will work with ISDN, and businesscustomers are beginning to experiment with a variety of services available onthe network.andP;  By the end of 1990, as many as 500,000 ISDN lines are expectedto be in use, according to Richard Sterry, a marketing vice president formodem manufacturer Microcom.andP;  &quot;You'll start to see that [modem] stuff die offand the ISDN part catch on,&quot; he predicts.andM;Others are not so sure.andP;  &quot;ISDN is being inhibited by a lack of cohesivedirection for the telecommunications industry as a whole,&quot; says RichardtenEyck, telecommunications director for the Boston Computer Society.andP;  &quot;ISDNis basically a standardized way of combining voice and data.andP;  Right now,people don't see the need for it.&quot;andM;Service with a DialandM;While waiting for ISDN to arrive, telephone power users can look forward to abevy of new calling services to be unveiled in the next few years.andM;One service, recently introduced by Bell Atlantic in parts of New Jersey,stops unwanted calls before the phone rings.andP;  Aptly named Call Block, theservice rejects calls from telephone numbers you program into the phone; thesnubbed parties hear a recorded message stating that calls are not beingaccepted.andM;Call Block is Bell Atlantic's marketing name for a service known genericallyas selective call rejection.andP;  Another new offering, selective callforwarding, allows subscribers to forward calls from specific numbers only.andO;Distinctive ringing enables the telephone to emit a special ring when a callcomes from one of several prespecified numbers.andP;  Enhanced call waiting offersa way for you to toggle call-waiting on and off--a particular boon to modemusers who fear that their data transfers will be wiped out by the tone froman incoming call.andP;  Another service allows you to call back the person whocalled you last without having to know the number.andM;The crown jewel of the new calling services is number identification, whichallows subscribers who have purchased a special add-on display to see thecalling party's number before picking up the phone.andP;  Most of these services,in fact, are based on the phone system's newfound ability to pass alonginformation about the caller.andM;In the days before digital switching, calls were set up by forwarding thedialed number from one phone office to another over the same voice circuitthat would be used for the actual phone call.andP;  Today, many offices send callinformation over special data circuits that are completely separate from thevoice connections themselves.andP;  With separate circuits, the lines are lesscrowd and can hold more information.andM;Number identification will also improve old standbys such as 911 emergencylines, giving officials the names and addresses of distraught callers andeven the phone numbers of their neighbors.andP;  Tracing a weirdo caller will alsobecome much easier--subscribers to Bell Atlantic's Call Trace service needonly press a button to have the last caller's number recorded in a phonecompany computer for possible action by authorities.andM;PC users can look forward to hardware and software made for the new services.andO;New Haven, Connecticut-based Scientific Systems is building a device thatplugs into the telephone jack and a PC's RS-232 port.andP;  Working with specialsoftware, the device will trap the incoming phone number, search a databasefor information related to that number, and display it onscreen beforepicking up the receiver.andP;  The company is also working on a similar productfor ISDN, which will assign each phone number a priority and decide whetherto put a call through or deliver a recorded message.andM;Other coming phone service attractions, for use with or without ISDN, includeuniversal voice mail (the phone company's version of a centrazlied answeringmachine), voice dialing (yell &quot;Fire!&quot; and the phone contacts the firedepartment automatically), and miscellaneous services such as the ability tocall a number provided by directory assistance by pressing a single button.andM;The Flip SideandM;The benefits of the microprocessor revolution are finally catching up withthe local telephone system.andP;  Each new improvement--increasing digitalizationand intelligence in call-switching systems, substituting fiber forcopper--will bring the phone system closer to being a versatile, multipurposenetwork, stimulating countless new communications services and applications.andM;But even as people start to take advantage of the emerging capabilities, somequestions remain unanswered.andP;  How much will the new services cost, and whowill be able to afford them?andP;  For most of this century, long-distancerevenues subsidized local phone rates, keeping prices low enough that about93 percent of all households currently have a phone.andM;But affordable phone service may be a thing of the past.andP;  In the wake of the1984 Bell System breakup, local phone rates rose by about 55 percent, whilelong-distance rates fell by about 40 percent.andP;  Some consumer advocates claimthat local phone companies are beefing up their networks and adding servicesthat cater to affluent customers, not average subscribers.andP;  Adding these newservices could more than double a phone bill.andP;  For instance, New Jersey Bell,one of the few companies currently offering the services, charges anadditional $8.00 per month for number identification and selective callrejection combined; basic local phone service costs only $7.80 per month.andO;Issues of funding and pricing remain to be ironed out on the state andfederal levels.andM;Finally, as the telephone system grows more powerful, privacy becomes anissue.andP;  Market tests of the number identification service have provokedcomplaints from the American Civil Liberties Union and individual citizens onthe grounds of privacy invasion.andP;  Critics point out that increased systemintelligence will enable the phone company to track who's talking to whom,or, when video capabilities come on-line, who's watching what.andM;Richard tenEyck asks, &quot;How's it going to work?andP;  Are we going to have a screenon the wall like in 1984?andP;  People are getting wary of the incredible powerthat is suddenly becoming available.&quot;andM;But, then again, one man's fear is another man's technology.andP;  Just ask ChrisBurns.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
