Hills saysthat the eight nations considered to be the worst violators of United States'copyright laws covering intellectual property have improved their protectionenough that they won't be subject to the &quot;Super 301&quot; restrictions mandated bythe 1988 omnibus trade law.andM;Eight of twenty-five countries were put on the priority watch list last May25 because of their apparent indifference to whether people violated U.S.andO;companies' software copyrights, and Hills said this week that South Korea,Taiwan, and Saudi Arabia had improved their compliance enough to warrantdowngrading them from the &quot;priority&quot; watch status to a less aggressivelymonitored list.andM;Brazil, India, Mexico, the People's Republic of China, and Thailand remain onthe priority watch list.andM;Industry representatives have called for Turkey and Malaysia to be added tothe priority list, something which the administration has resisted.andM;(John McCormick/19891103)</TEXT></DOC>
