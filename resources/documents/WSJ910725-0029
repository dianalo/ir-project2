The September silver futures contract plunged 28 cents anounce, or 6.5%, to $4.01, and platinum for October deliverydropped $12.30 an ounce, or 3.2%, to $368.50. Selling ofsilver and platinum bullion in Europe sparked the decline,analysts and traders said.</LP><TEXT>   Platinum is now priced nearly equal to gold; the Octobergold contract sank $3.90 an ounce yesterday to $368. Platinumhas fallen below gold only twice in the past decade, in 1983and 1985.   Delays in the opening of New York metals markets, causedby flooding in a communications facility following torrentialrainstorms, added to the tension on the New York futuresexchanges' combined trading floor yesterday morning.   &quot;We were biting our nails waiting for the opening,&quot; said aplatinum trader. &quot;There was a lot of frustration because themarket had been quiet for quite a while, and the first timeit moved we had this delay.&quot; Traders were anxiously watchingtrading in London markets, fearing they would lose theiropportunity to make money on the big moves.   A large amount of platinum, rumored at more than one ton,was said to have been sold in London. The seller, tradersspeculated, was the cash-strapped Soviet Union, leading toworries that additional metals sales would follow.   A large amount of silver was sold by Middle Easterninvestors in Zurich and London, analysts said. Rumors wererampant that the National Commercial Bank in Jeddah, SaudiArabia, sold the silver. NCB was involved in large gold saleslast year that hammered prices.   Speculation also circulated that the silver sale wasrelated to the closure of Bank of Credit andamp; CommerceInternational. The rumors varied from the sale being made byBCCI, by BCCI depositors facing liquidity problems, orshareholders trying to raise funds to meet BCCI obligations.The size and status of BCCI's gold holdings have also beenthe subject of speculation recently, an analyst said.   &quot;{The rumors} are all smoke,&quot; said Dinsa Mehta, chiefbullion trader for Chase Manhattan Bank. &quot;Our question is:What's behind the smoke?&quot;   The sale of the physical platinum and silver was thecatalyst for panic selling by investors who saw prices fallbelow key support levels. Commodity funds and brokerage firmswere among the biggest sellers, said Don Tierney, preciousmetals analyst at Fortune Commodities on the floor of NewYork's Commodity Exchange. Some investors liquidated to avoidbeing asked to put up additional capital, he added.   Volume in silver was an estimated 55,000 contracts, wellabove the daily average of about 28,000. Gold volume was alsoheavy, at an estimated 50,000 contracts compared with theaverage of about 30,000. Platinum traded an estimated 5,363scontracts yesterday, well above the average so far this yearof about 2,400. On Tuesday, platinum traded 650 contracts.   Adding further to platinum and silver's woes were weakdurable goods orders and auto sales figures, indicating theeconomy hasn't completely shaken off recessionary patterns.Indeed, several analysts blamed the economic figures forexacerbating the sell-offs in silver and platinum. Bothmetals are used heavily in industrial applications: platinumin automobile catalytic converters and silver in photography.   What to expect today? It's anybody's guess, analysts said.Some were encouraged that silver didn't fall below thepsychologically important level of $4. Silver could startbuilding a new base around $4 to $4.05, said JeffreyChristian, managing director of CPM Group, a New Yorkconsulting concern. On the other hand, prices also could drop20 cents further to $3.80.   Analysts and traders find the razor-thin differencebetween gold and platinum prices worrisome for platinum. Manyinvestors use a gold-platinum ratio strategy that bets on therelative performance of each metal. Platinum usually tradesat a premium to gold but now that the two are trading almostat parity, traders may begin to buy gold and sell platinum,on the expectation that gold will perform better, analystssaid.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Corn and soybean futures prices sankas some traders took profits on Tuesday's big rally. Thatrally was sparked by forecasts for hot and dry conditionsover much of the Midwest next week. If harsh weatherdevelops, the potential yield of the corn and soybean cropsmight drop. Many traders are speculating that dry conditionsin sections of the Midwest since early June have caused somedamage to crops there. After the close of trading at theChicago Board of Trade, the National Weather Service releaseda six-to-10 day forecast for abovenormal temperatures andnormal precipitation in major corn and soybean producingstates such as Iowa and Minnesota. In farm states such asIndiana and Ohio, the service forecast normal temperaturesand below-normal precipitation.                                                                                                          ENERGY: Crude oil futures rose in heavy trading on the NewYork Mercantile Exchange, despite being hit early in the dayby a report indicating that Iraq may be seeking to exportmore oil than earlier reports suggested. The September crudecontract rose 20 cents to settle at $21.52 a barrel. TheOctober contract settled at $21.43, up 19 cents. Yesterday,an Associated Press-Dow Jones report said Iraq has nearlydoubled to $2.6 billion the amount of oil it's seekingpermission from the United Nations to sell to buy food.Earlier this week, the U.N. Persian Gulf human rights envoyappealed to the U.N. to let Iraq sell $1 billion of crudeoil. Trading seemed agonized much of the day over thepossible impact on crude futures of the increased Iraqiexports, including continuing speculation that the U.S.government will back the U.N. in allowing Iraq to sell thecrude. But the daylong slump was reversed by a late rally,apparently reflecting the market's readying for an Iraqideadline of sorts today, when that country must convince theU.N. it has revealed its nuclear weapons program or possiblyface military consequences.                                                                                                          COTTON: Futures prices fell sharply across the board.Cotton for October delivery ended at 69.32 cents a pound,down 1.66 cents. December cotton lost 1.38 cents to finish at69.02 cents. Ernest Simon, cotton specialist at PrudentialSecurities, called the move largely technical in nature.Traders appear to be becoming more bearish, he said, inanticipation of large U.S. and world-wide crops, along withuncertain demand in Asia and Europe.</TEXT></DOC>
