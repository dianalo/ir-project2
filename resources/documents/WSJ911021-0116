Despite his conservativecredentials, the low-key Mr. Barr probably won't draw thelong knives on Capitol Hill. After a decade of personalattacks on Edwin Meese and the PR problems of DickThornburgh, it will be good to have an Attorney General in aposition to make the issues the issue.   President Bush chose Deputy Attorney General Barr overseveral well-known politicians in part to save the staffbriefings every time a legal crisis occurs. There is often notime for this luxury, whether it's an unconstitutional demandfrom Congress or some off-the-reservation federal prosecutorplanning to indict a foreign head of state. It's also a signthat Mr. Bush expects the Justice Department to play its partin his domestic agenda item of removing the grotesqueriesfrom American law. Reform needs all the help it can get:</LP><TEXT>   Lawyers Need Bashing. Dan Quayle started the fight fortort reform, joined by Solicitor General Kenneth Starr, butonly the full weight of the Justice Department can goshoulder to shoulder with the plaintiff-lawyer bar and itsPACs. The organized bar opposes the litigation-dampening ideathat the winning party should get his legal fees paid, andwill fall on its sword to keep the lottery of punitivedamages. The main reform hurdle is the high percentage ofMembers of Congress who were and could again be triallawyers.   Credit-Crunching Lawsuits. Attorneys General usually don'tworry about the economy, but that was before the law helpedcreate this recession. Bankers and their would-be customersunderstand the chill from overzealous regulators, who knowthat Congress and federal prosecutors are still looking forscapegoats. The junk-bond market may rebound, for example,but government lawsuits against Michael Milken allege it'sall a hoax. Last week prosecutors argued that while Mr.Milken has cooperated, he should rot in jail because hehasn't given them any new scalps. Appeals courts meanwhileare busily overturning securities convictions that judgesbelieve were based on witnesses, such as Ivan Boesky, whose&quot;cooperation&quot; was making up stories.   More Clarence Thomases. The judicial-nomination process atall levels of the federal courts may get even seamier nowthat the special interests are ever more desperate. Still,Justice Thomas proved that resolute nominees can prevail evenif they have paper trails. Justice can help protect thepersonal reputations of nominees, perhaps starting with acriminal investigation into the Thomas-hearing FBI leak.   Protecting the Presidency. Until recently, Mr. Barr ranJustice's Office of Legal Counsel, which helps defendseparation of powers. Next year, the Attorney General couldhelp stop reauthorization of budgetless, permanent,single-target special prosecutors appointed by Congress tocriminalize policy differences with the President's aides.Lawrence Walsh is the best argument that the law doesn't needsuch excesses.   Taming Envirolitigators. Vague environmental laws createda growth industry in lawsuits and criminal prosecutions,which have the main effect of driving up the cost of doingbusiness in this country. The bloodsport prosecution of Exxonfor the Alaska oil spill alleged that the accident wasintentional. The huge settlement included the curiousadmission that the spill amounted to hunting migratory birdswithout a license. Wetlands are a special problem, withJustice prosecuting people who clear rubbish off what somebureaucrat designates as a wetland. Instead, Justice shouldenforce the Takings Clause of the Constitution by insistingon compensation for owners from losses in value due towetlands protection.   An End to RICO? Justice has been on the wrong side of theRICO debate ever since Rudy Giuliani discovered that yellingRacketeer was easier than proving real crime. Mr. Quayle hassent word that he expects Justice to get on board behindreforming civil RICO, such as the absurd racketeering casesbetween heirs, Fortune 100s and feuding rabbis.   Mr. Barr would take office at a crossroads. With JusticeThomas, it looks as if the next ideological divide in theSupreme Court will be between conservatives and libertarians,no longer between conservatives and liberals. Economicliberties should also rise to the top of Justice's agenda. IfMr. Barr needs aides who understand these issues, Universityof Chicago Prof. Richard Epstein and George Mason Law DeanHenry Manne can provide references.   More than ever, this is a country where every issue, fromabortion to declaring war, somehow becomes a legal issue. Wehope Attorney General Barr will take the lead in returningthe law to its proper, more modest role.</TEXT></DOC>
