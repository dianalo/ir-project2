Machinist union members in Seattle, Portland, Ore., Wichita,Kan., and elsewhere began the walkout at 12:01 a.m. local time,union officials said.   In Seattle on Tuesday, the union overwhelmingly rejected whatBoeing said would be its final contract offer.   Union leaders had said they would notify a federal mediator, whojoined negotiations last weekend, that they would be willing toconsider resuming negotiations.   But Tom Baker, president of the Machinists' District Lodge 751,said the union would not be in favor of extending the midnightstrike deadline.   Boeing issued a statement several hours after the strike vote,expressing disappointment but vowing to continue operations withsupervisors and non-striking workers.   ``Our airline customers have been notified of a strike and ourintention to support deliveries to the best of our ability,'' theBoeing statement said. ``It is impossible to make a generalstatement on all defense and space programs since they are atvarious stages of development and production.''   Baker said the main reason for the strike vote was a feelingthat Boeing workers deserved a greater share of the company'srecord prosperity.   Boeing, the world's largest commercial airplane builder, isenjoying its fifth consecutive year of record jetliner orders, withcarriers and leasing companies ordering 736 planes worth $38.5billion so far this year.   ``We have gone through the hard times with this company,'' Bakersaid. ``We just want to go through the good times with them as wellas the hard times.'' Boeing offered an immediate raise of 4percent, with 3 percent raises in 1990 and 1991. The proposedthree-year contract also contained annual bonuses of 8 percent of aworker's gross earnings this year and 3 percent the next, insuranceimprovements and reduced compulsory overtime requirements to 160hours a quarter.   Workers filling more than half of the 65,000-seat Kingdomejeered the offer and folded summaries of it into paper airplanesthat sailed through the stadium.   Boeing Machinists voting in Seattle, Wichita, Portland, andelsewhere were asked to decide whether to accept the contract, asimple majority vote, and whether to strike, which requires atwo-thirds majority of members voting.   Union leaders told the Machinists, who last struck Boeing in1977 for two months, the time was right to demand more.   ``If you aren't tough enough to secure a decent contract thistime you'll never get one,'' said Justin Ostro, general union vicepresident and bargaining coordinator.   ``If you turn tail and run, don't come back in three years''expecting great change, he added. ``There is no good time tostrike. There is only the right time.''   Though Pentagon cutbacks have reduced military business, onedivision, Boeing Commercial Airplanes, has a backlog of nearly1,600 jets worth about $70 billion and deliveries extending wellinto the mid-1990s.   For 1988, profits were $614 million on $16.96 billion in sales.Boeing also is holding $3.66 billion in cash and short-term notes.   Baker said a strike could last ``a week. It could be months.''</TEXT></DOC>
