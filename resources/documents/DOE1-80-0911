<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-80-0911 </DOCNO><TEXT>The Travis Peak formation (lower Cretaceous) in the eastern East Texasbasin is a fluvio-deltaic depositional system divided into large-scalefacies packages: a middle sandstone-rich fluvial and delta-plain sequencethat is gradationally overlain and underlain by a marine-influenced delta-fringezone with a higher mudstone content. Domes and structural terraces onthe west flank of the Sabine Uplift influenced deposition of Travis Peaksediments, and most Travis Peak gas production in this area is from thinsandstones (andless;25 ft[andless;7.6 m] thick) in the upper delta-fringe facies. Thetrapping mechanism is stratigraphic pinch-out of sandstones or porosityzones within sandstone, or both, on the flanks of structures. Detailedmapping of producing sandstone sequences in the uppermost upper delta-fringeon the western flank of the Bethany structure has delineated fluvialchannelways, distributary or tidal channels, and barrier of distributary-mouthbars. Most Travis Peak gas production in the Bethany West area is fromthe bases of channel sandstones in a marine-influenced facies belt. TravisPeak sandstones in the eastern East Texas basin have undergone a complexseries of diagenetic modifications. Precipitation of authigenic quartz,ankerite, dolomite, illite, and chlorite and the introduction of reservoirbitumen were the most important causes of occlusion of primary porosityand reduction of permeability. Permeability decreases with depth in theTravis Peak, which suggests that the diagenetic processes that causedextensive cementation and resultant low permeability throughout mostof the formation operated less completely on sediments deposited nearthe top of the succession.</TEXT></DOC>
