Viktor Karpov, the Soviet foreign ministry's top arms controlofficial, said such a treaty was possible ``within two or threemonths.   ``However, if you mark time ... then there will be no suchchance,'' he told a news conference, speaking through aninterpreter.   Karpov was responding to questions about U.S. demands that theSoviet Union dismantle its partially completed radar installationat Krasnoyarsk, in Siberia, before agreement on a treaty onintercontinential nuclear weapons is possible.   The United States put forth that position in a statementWednesday at the close of a one-week conference reviewing the 1972Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty. Karpov headed the Soviet delegation.   U.S. and Soviet negotiators have conducted separate talks inGeneva on long-range, or strategic missiles, since March 1985. Theyhave agreed in principle to reduce such arsenals by 50 percent, buta number of details have yet to be resolved.   In December, the superpowers signed a treaty to destroymedium-and shorter-range nuclear missiles.   The Soviets have constantly linked an agreement on long-rangemissiles to restrictions on the Reagan administration's space-basedmissile defense system, known officially as the Strategic DefenseInitiative and popularly called ``Star Wars.'' The United Stateshas rejected such a linkage.   Karpov said that the Soviet Union had repeated to the UnitedStates an offer to dismantle the equipment of the Krasnoyarskradar, if the United States would agree to commit itself to the ABMtreaty for nine or 10 years.   The Soviets originally made that offer in July, speaking of aperiod of 10 years. The United States said at the time it welcomedthe offer to dismantle the radar but that it would not accept theconditions imposed on the offer.   The United States maintains that the Krasnoyarsk radar violatesthe ABM treaty because it could be used to help direct the Sovietresponse to a nuclear missile attack. The Soviets say the radar isdesigned to track space objects, and therefore doesn't violate thetreaty.   The ABM treaty limits the anti-missile defense systems that eachside can build.   Karpov said that the Soviets were willing to dismantle two otherradars deployed last year in Gomel, near Kiev, which the UnitedStates also has complained about.   ``We would be prepared to destroy the elements,'' Karpov said.   The U.S. statement Wednesday said that the Soviet Union, duringthe review conference, did not satisfy U.S. concerns about theKrasnoyarsk radar, and that the United States may take action tosuspend or terminate the ABM treaty.   Karpov seemed to appeal for restraint, saying that ``unilateralactions in such a serious matter as the ABM treaty areinadmissable.''</TEXT></DOC>
