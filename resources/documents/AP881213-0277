The $1.384 million fine will be imposed if Pepperidge Farm doesnot contest it within 15 working days, said Jack Hord, spokesman inPhiladelphia for OSHA, an arm of the U.S. Department of Labor.   The Norwalk, Conn.-based company said the fine was ``arbitrarilyassigned and totally unjustified'' and said it would contest thealleged violations.   There have been eight proposed fines higher than the PepperidgeFarm proposal, according to Frank Kane, OSHA spokesman in Washington.   Fifty workers at Pepperidge Farm's plant in Downingtown, Pa.,developed carpal tunnel syndrome, an inflamation of the sheathsaround nerve endings, in the fingers, wrists and shoulders,according to Hord. Twenty-six of them required surgery, Hord said.   The injuries resulted from repeatedly putting together sandwichcookies, Hord said.   OSHA's six-month investigation recorded 389 willful violations ofrecord-keeping rules and safety standards at the 1,500-worker plant,according to a news release.   There were gaps and inaccuracies in illness records and althoughthe plant had a manual on how to prevent the injuries, officials didnot implement the recommendations, according to OSHA.   ``Management was clearly aware of the need to address ergonomichazards at this Pepperidge Farm plant, yet chose to ignore its ownexperts and employees while more and more employees sufferedcrippling injury,'' said John A. Pendergrass, assistant Secretary ofLabor and OSHA head.   ``The results were predictable: an increase in injuries, repeatedtrauma for previously injured employees, high turnover at the plantand a call to OSHA for help,'' Pendergrass said.   In disputing the proposed fine, Pepperidge Farm said the disordercan occur in all occupations that involve repetitive movements.   ``We have been singled out and chastised for a phenomenon commonto myriad jobs _ both blue-collar and white-collar _ requiringrepetitive movement of hands and arms,'' Richard A. Shea, PepperidgeFarm president, said in a prepared statement.   The company said it has been improving its Downingtown operationfor the past three years by installing automatic case packers andredesigning the assembly line. The company also has been rotatingworkers involved in repetitive motions every 20 to 30 minutes,Pepperidge Farm said.   ``We have spent in excess of $275,000 over the past two years toimprove the ergonomics of our cookie operation,'' said Dale Stokes,manager of the Downingtown plant. ``We are slated to spend anadditional $250,000 over the next year on the ergonomic design ofour cookie assortment line.''   The company is reviewing its record-keeping of injuries,according to a press release.   There are eight U.S. Pepperidge Farm plants, including four thatmake cookies, said Karen Sportini, company spokeswoman. The othercookie factories are in Willard, Ohio; Richmond, Utah, and Lakeland,Fla., she said.   After checking within OSHA, Akio Konoshima, an agency spokesmanin Washington, said he was not aware of any investigations atPepperidge's other plants.</TEXT></DOC>
