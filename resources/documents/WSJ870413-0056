In addition to the 9,628,500 common shares tendered, the First Boston unit said it had been tendered 1,884,000 preference shares, or 67% of those outstanding, and 945,000 preferred shares, or 49.5%. The unit also said it had extended the tender offer to 5 p.m. EDT Wednesday from last Friday morning for shares of the Pittsburgh-based consumer and industrial products concern.    Separately, New York-based Spear, Leeds andamp; Kellogg boosted its stake in Allegheny's $11.25 convertible preferred stock to 16.21% and said it won't tender the stock to the First Boston unit, according to two Securities and Exchange Commission filings released Friday.    In the SEC filings, the brokerage partnership said it holds 295,900 Allegheny preferred shares, including 131,000 shares purchased last Thursday at $88.50 each and 14,900 shares purchased from April 3 through last Tuesday at $87 to $87.75 a share.    According to the filings, Spear Leeds also said it will vote its shares against a subsequent merger of Allegheny with the First Boston unit after expiration of the tender offer. The filings also said the partnership expects to exercise its right as a dissenting shareholder under Pennsylvania law to have an independent appraisal of the value of its holdings in connection with the merger if it is completed.    Spear Leeds didn't give a reason in the filing for its decision not to tender its Allegheny holdings.    The partnership also said it &quot;doesn't anticipate materially increasing its investment&quot; in Allegheny securities, though it may seek to acquire more preferred stock in the ordinary course of its business. Previously, Spear Leeds said it planned to increase its Allegheny holdings, but hadn't decided how many additional shares it would buy. </TEXT></DOC>
