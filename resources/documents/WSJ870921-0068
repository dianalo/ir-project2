The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. approved the transfer of the insured deposits of the failed bank, Stockmen's Bank andamp; Trust Co., Gillette, Wyo., to First Interstate Bank of Gillette. Stockmen's was closed by the state examiner, and the FDIC was named receiver.    A spokesman said the FDIC decided to arrange an insured-deposit transfer because it couldn't determine the failed bank's potential losses in contingent liabilities. Otherwise, the agency would have tried to arrange a takeover of the bank by another institution.    When it was closed, the bank had assets of $127.5 million and deposits of about $96.7 million in 16,500 deposit accounts, including about $319,000 in 80 accounts that exceeded the federal insurance limit of $100,000. Uninsured depositors and nondepositor creditors will share proportionately with the FDIC in the proceeds realized from liquidating the failed bank's assets, the agency said.    Administration of the transferred deposits will be financed by a cash payment from the FDIC. The acquiring bank is paying the FDIC a premium of $75,000 for the right to receive the deposits. Stockmen's, which wasn't an agriculture bank, is the 131st bank to fail this year and the second in Wyoming. There also have been 16 assistance transactions, in which the FDIC provides temporary aid to avert failure, this year.    The thrift closed by the government was Phenix Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, Phenix City, Ala. All of its accounts have been transferred to a new federal mutual association, Phenix Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, F.A., which was chartered by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board to acquire the deposits, offices, assets and liabilities of the old thrift.    The Bank Board has approved a five-member board for the new institution and a contract with First Liberty Financial Corp., Atlanta, a savings and loan holding company, to provide a management team to guide Phenix Federal's daily operations. Phenix Federal is the 21st institution to be placed in the Bank Board's management-consignment program this year, and the first in Alabama.    There were 29 such actions in the country last year. In the program, the government takes over thrifts and replaces their managements.    The Sandamp;L was closed after the Bank Board found the institution was insolvent, had substantially dissipated its assets through the violation of regulations and laws, and was in an unsafe and unsound condition to transact business.    The former Phenix Federal was a federally chartered stock association, with $225 million in assets and 10 offices in Alabama. </TEXT></DOC>
