It thusrepresents an industrial sector which is concerned with the exploitationand technical application of the regenerative energy resource 'Sun' inthe most extensive sense. The associated companies of BSE have substantiallyinfluenced the development of these young techniques thus finding theway to a reliable market-offer in Germany and abroad very quickly. Thevarieties of their products include installations and systems for nearlyall reasonable ways of utilizing solar energy. For direct use: Collectorsystems for hot water production, domestic heating, cooling, air-conditioning,solar thermal and solar electrical power generation and process heatgeneration for a wide field of applications. For indirect use: Heat pumps,wind energy converters, water power plants and systems using biomass.The numerous technical solutions represent the efficiency standard ofthe German solar industry which in international comparison holds oneof the leading positions and which understands itself as a competentpartner of foreign countries. The present brochure gives a general surveyof the production program of the associated companies of BSE and of theirknow-how in the numerous applications of solar energy.</TEXT></DOC>
