This effort will put the central bank on a collision course withthe new administration and make it more difficult for President Bushto keep his campaign pledge to lower the budget deficit withoutresorting to new taxes, analysts say.   Fed policy-makers were gathering today for two days ofclosed-door meetings to set monetary growth targets for 1989. Theiractions will not be revealed until Federal Reserve Chairman AlanGreenspan testifies to Congress on Feb. 21.   Private economists are widely predicting that the Fed willcontinue pushing interest rates higher because of fears that theeconomy is still growing too rapidly to keep inflation under control.   ``There is no question that there will be a tightening. Thequestion is how much,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of theBoston Co.   Some economists would not rule out a one-half percentage pointincrease in the Fed's discount rate, which now stands 6.5 percent,but other analysts argued that the Fed would probably avoid such adramatic change in favor of more subtle behind-the-scenes tighteningmoves. The discount rate is the interest the Fed charges to makeloans to commercial banks.   Since last March, the Fed has been draining bank reserves fromthe system, thus making money more scarce and the cost of money _interest rates _ higher.   Analysts keep track of this process by watching the federal fundsrate, the interest banks charge to make loans to each other. Thefederal funds rate now stands above 9 percent and analysts predictit is likely to rise by about one-quarter percentage more in thecoming two months.   This will likely force banks to boost their prime lending rate,which now stands at 10.5 percent, already its highest level sincemid-1985, economists say.   Economists also say that home loans, both adjustable andfixed-rate mortgages, are headed higher, with some predicting thatfixed-rate mortgages will climb to around 11 percent. Currently,fixed-rate mortgages are averaging 10.6 percent, according to anationwide survey by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., up from9.9 percent a year ago.   Bush has pledged to reduce this year's expected $160 billionbudget deficit by more than $60 billion in the fiscal year whichbegins next Oct. 1, but such a goal would be jeopardized by theFed's inflation-fighting efforts.   Bush's budget, which he will unveil on Thursday, will use thesame optimistic assessment of the economy employed by then-PresidentReagan in his final budget last month.   Fed credit-tightening already has pushed short-term interestrates a full 2 percentage points higher than the administration'sestimate of 6.3 percent for 1989 and Fed officials are working toslow economic growth to between 2 percent and 2.5 percent,significantly below the 3.2 percent forecast by the administration.   Both of these discrepancies are significant because they spelllower government revenues, higher interest payments to finance the$2.7 trillion national debt and a larger budget deficit.   ``Everybody knows the administration's economic forecast can'twork,'' said Michael Evans, head of a Washington forecasting firm.``Greenspan is running the economy and Bush isn't.''   The administration has been trying to convince the Fed that itsworries about inflation are overblown. Bush himself said last weekthat Greenspan was ``more concerned about inflation than I am rightnow.''   But the Fed will likely withstand the political pressure for alooser monetary policy, analysts said, especially in view ofbusiness statistics showing an economy with tight labor markets andindustries operating at peak capacity.   Fed officials hope to slow the economy enough to ward off anotherinflationary spiral without dampening demand so much that it risks arecession.   Roger Brinner, senior economist at Data Resources Inc., said hebelieved the Fed would be able to achieve this ``soft landing.''   ``I don't think there will be a recession through 1990 becausethe Fed acted early to fight inflation and continues to avoid anypanic moves which would mean very large and sudden increases ininterest rates,'' Brinner said.   The Fed policy-making group is known as the Federal Open MarketCommittee, made up of the seven members of the Federal Reserve Boardin Washington and five of the 12 presidents of Fed district banks.</TEXT></DOC>
