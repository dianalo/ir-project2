Dewey Brackett, who in congressional testimony has criticizedconditions at the government-run paper, said proposals by ombudsmanPhilip M. Foisie could even ``weaken the newspaper's integrity andits independence.''   Foisie, a former foreign editor at the Washington Post andexecutive editor of the International Herald Tribune, was namedombudsman for the two Stars and Stripes newspapers last June,raising hopes of civilian staffers like Brackett who complain ofcensorship and other problems.   The European Stars and Stripes, published in West Germany, isedited separately from the Tokyo-based Pacific paper.   Last weekend, the Stars and Stripes published a report onFoisie's interim recommendations on the editorship of the papers.The ombudsman said he was issuing the proposals before his overallreport on the Pacific paper because the Pentagon had announced thata U.S. Marine colonel would succeed the U.S. Air Force colonel nowcarrying the title editor in chief of the paper.   Foisie recommends that a military officer continue to commandthe paper's mix of military and civilian staff members, but withthe title of publisher.   He said a civilian ``who has devoted his career to quality dailyprint journalism'' should be in charge of what appears in thenewspaper.   He also recommends new personnel policies, including ``theability to dismiss editorial personnel expeditiously for what (thepublisher and editor) regard as valid professional cause and tohire the best available journalists.''   Brackett said that would give less protection than civilianjournalists have now.   Col. Edwin J. Montgomery, who retires this spring after fouryears as editor in chief, said Thursday the ombudsman's proposal``looks workable to me. I think it's important to get the rightperson in the job'' of editor.   The Pentagon is expected to consider the ombudsman'srecommendations as well as congressional views.   Meanwhile, Brackett and the paper's Okinawa bureau chief, KatePound, said a new directive from U.S. Pacific military headquartersin Hawaii could restrict reporters' freedom. The directive makesStars and Stripes reporters subject to decisions by base commandersto restrict off-base travel by U.S. government employees.   Ms. Pound said in a telephone interview that the rule couldblock Stars and Stripes reporters from reporting on anti-basedemonstrations or attacks on U.S. troops in the Philippines, Japan,South Korea or Micronesia.   The paper's reporters have no special access on military bases,she said, ``and now they're saying that since we are governmentemployees, they can limit us off-base, too.''   ``If they get tough, all we're going to be able to cover is theopening of the officers' wives club gift shop.''   Montgomery said U.S. commanders are responsible for the safetyof U.S. government personnel. But, he added, ``If we need to havethose policies relaxed for the purposes of gathering news, then wecan request they be relaxed.''</TEXT></DOC>
