The experimental data are interpreted in terms ofpossible production mechanisms such as statistical emission from highlyexcited fragments or nucleon-nucleon bremsstrahlung. Future perspectivesof hard photon emission and neutral meson production in heavy ion collisionsat relativistic bombarding energies are outlined.</TEXT></DOC>
