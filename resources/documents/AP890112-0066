BIGELOW</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A plan to clean this city's notoriously filthyair by planting millions of trees and curtailing driving could helpcounter the greenhouse effect if copied by other urban areas, anenvironmentalist said.   ``If we're going to address this problem it will be a grass-rootseffort by activists throughout the cities of the world,'' saidJeremy Rifkin, director of the Foundation on Economic Trends and amember of the Global Greenhouse Network, a coalition ofenvironmental activists in 35 countries.   In response to federal pressure to reduce smog and local anxietyabout growth and traffic congestion, Mayor Tom Bradley recentlyproposed planting 2 million to 5 million trees throughout the cityduring the next five years, encouraging the use of public transportand ride-sharing, and weaning industries away from fossil fuels thatgenerate high levels of carbon dioxide.   The 63-point proposal represents the first urban effort to curbthe worldwide greenhouse effect, said Rifkin, who joined the mayorat a City Hall news conference Wednesday. Bradley said he would askmayors of cities throughout the world to emulate the plan.   ``This landmark project, initiated in a major Americanmetropolis, will focus on the urban areas throughout the world,''Rifkin said.   ``It is vital for the future of the planet that we begin tosharply reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases thatcontribute to the greenhouse effect.''   The greenhouse effect is a term used by scientists to describe apotential warming of the Earth's temperature by pollution and carbondioxide that trap solar radiation in the atmosphere. Many scientistsfear it could cause the planet's temperature to raise severaldegrees, melting polar ice, raising sea levels and flooding coastalcities and possibly disrupting agriculture.   Rifkin said the most dramatic element of the plan is the proposedplanting of trees, which absorb carbon dioxide and producelife-giving oxygen.   ``Up to 5 million trees planted in the right places in SouthernCalifornia will conserve the energy equivalent of one to two newpower plants,'' said Andy Lipkis, executive director of TreePeople,a conservation and community-action group that is organizing theplanting campaign.   The city has donated $25,000 of an estimated $100,000 needed toorganize the planting, which probably will cost several milliondollars, Lipkis said.   Among the specific recommendations of the plan, which Bradleyunveiled Jan. 4, are mandatory parking fees at shopping malls,replacing the city's cars and trucks with newer models that getbetter mileage and establishing tax incentives for home energyconservation.</TEXT></DOC>
