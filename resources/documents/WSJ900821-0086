Thus far, thecommentary has leaned toward the alarmist. U.S. News andamp; WorldReport said on Aug. 13, &quot;Iraq's huge tank army, operating inopen desert ideally suited to tank warfare, is a match for asuperpower.&quot; Other sources speak in wide-eyed awe of amillion &quot;battle-hardened troops,&quot; supported by a massivechemical weapons inventory, advancing under the protection ofplanes flown, according to the Aug. 8 issue of the New YorkTimes, by &quot;pilots whose skill and experience makes them themost feared flyers in the Middle East.&quot;   It's right to be cautious, but these press accounts soundlike descriptions of the Israeli army, not the Iraqi. Baghdadfields a competent but limited extension of its mechanisms ofinternal repression. This month marks only the secondanniversary of the formal end to the Iran-Iraq War -- a warthat was, in the words of strategic expert Lawrence Freedman&quot;a delicate balance of incompetence.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   True, the Iraqis have amassed a significant militarymachine. But it is a giant with feet of clay -- which is whySaddam is resorting to hostage-taking.   -- Armor. Iraq has indeed &quot;amassed 5,500 tanks, more thanHitler had on the eve of the Nazi invasion of Poland&quot; as U.S.News reported, but at least 4,000 of those, according to theInternational Institute for Strategic Studies, are outmodedSoviet-made T-54/-55s and Chinese versions of the same tank.Another 1,000 are Soviet T-62s, a better tank but one theIsraelis destroyed easily during the 1982 invasion ofLebanon. Only the remaining 500 tanks can be classed asmodern types.   -- Troops. Nearly half of Iraq's 1 million men aremobilized reservists. They and their regular armycounterparts had their hands full countering the poorlytrained and equipped Iranians. Even when fighting on theirown territory, Iraqi troops surrendered in relatively largenumbers when the need (or opportunity) arose. Refugee reportsfrom Kuwait have not indicated a dramatic improvement introop morale or competence (though loot and rape haveapparently raised more than a few spirits).   -- Chemical weapons. Iraq's substantial chemical inventoryhas been used principally against unprepared troops andunprotected civilians. It is a defensive weapon of limitedutility against a well-prepared, mobile foe. The Iranianswere able to counter it with masks and sometimes even wettedhandkerchiefs.   -- Airpower. The Iraqi air arm turned in a decidedlylackluster performance during the Iran-Iraq War. They were nomatch for the Iranians in dogfights, and their close airsupport of ground troops was largely ineffective. David Evansand Richard Company, active duty U.S. officers writing in theNovember 1984 issue of the Atlantic monthly, observed, &quot; . .. Iraqi pilots have dropped most of their bombs from 25,000feet -- 24,000 feet too high for the pinpoint accuracy neededto destroy tanks and artillery batteries.&quot; Iraqi pilotsimproved -- but not by much -- as the war went on and theIranians proved unable to overcome their spare partsshortages.   In the Iran-Iraq war, the Iraqi army had difficultycoordinating a limited advance against a weak, unpreparedfoe. Time and again during the conflict, Baghdad displayedshortcomings in military leadership that crippled its forces.The overcentralized chain of command failed to make even themost mundane tactical decisions in a timely and advantageousmanner. Inter-service and inter-arms coordination wasrudimentary. When success was achieved -- in one notableengagement, the Iraqis were able to decimate a poorlydeployed Iranian armor division in a massive ambush conductedfrom defensive positions -- the officers responsible were notrewarded but shunted to the side, or even liquidatedoutright.   To Saddam Hussein, the military is a tool of repressionand threat. Military competence, if allowed to go too far,would threaten his own position. So he deals with it in waysreminiscent of Josef Stalin, who decimated his officer corpson the eve of World War II. Only gradually, using time andspace, was Moscow able to rebuild a functioning militarymachine. Saddam Hussein will have less time and less space.   Saddam Hussein's military weakness has been compounded byintelligence failure. The general form of Western, especiallyU.S., response to an invasion of Kuwait was predictable. Iraqhad to act fast before the Americans arrived. Yet Saddamrepeated his costliest error of the Iran-Iraq War, when histroops sat still after they reached their initial objectives.The Iranians regrouped and drew the Iraqis into protractedwarfare.   Saddam's Kuwait blunder may be even bigger. He picked themost inappropriate time for an attack. A year ago, Americafaced more strategic constraints from the Soviets. A yearfrom now, American forces may not be so numerous,well-trained or well-equipped.   Then, he bungled operationally. Halting after grabbingKuwait has provided the U.S. and its allies time forreinforcement. And tactically, Iraq is in a lot of trouble.The U.S. military has rebounded from its low point in thewaning days of the Vietnam War. It is a force constructed fora war of movement. Its leadership, down through brigadelevel, are &quot;battle-hardened&quot; too -- in the Vietnam War. Itscapabilities will be magnified by the complete control of theair and seas it can expect to enjoy.   Speculation concerning the need to break through Iraqidefenses (at heavy cost) is misplaced. Kuwait will not beliberated by slugging through that oil-rich chunk of land,but rather by using U.S. mobility to strike across Iraqilines of communications toward the only strategic target ofconsequence to the dictatorship, Baghdad, the Iraqi capital.   ---   Mr. Marks, now a political analyst at the Academy of thePacific in Honolulu, Hawaii, studied the Iran-Iraq War forU.S. intelligence.</TEXT></DOC>
