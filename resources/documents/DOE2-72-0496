The analytical expression for the value of relativecontrast at the output of the flaw detector is derived. The optimal energyof x radiation source depending on the parameters of the radiation flawdetector is calculated. The problems related to computerized flaw detectoroutput signal processing are considered.</TEXT></DOC>
