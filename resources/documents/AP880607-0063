Fierce fighting erupted around Soongshil University when radicalstudents screaming anti-government slogans poured out of the schoolto attack riot police. Several officers hit by firebombs werecovered in orange flames before other police extinguished the fires.   Radical students from across the capital had gathered at theschool to mourn a Shoonshil student who died Monday of woundssuffered when he set fire to himself two days earlier in ananti-government protest.   ``Down with the military dictatorship'' and ``Yankee go home,''masked students yelled as they hurled firebombs, rocks and bricks atriot troopers huddling behind shields. Police also hurled rocks.   Police rifle squads and armored vans fired hundreds of rounds oftear gas, but were forced back from the road in front of the schoolseveral times by students armed with wooden poles and iron bars.   Students blocked one road with two 15-foot-high basketballbackboards.   Several police officers and students were injured by rocks andother missiles, but police had no figures. Police did not report anyarrests.   The front of thecampus was draped in black mourning cloth andprotest banners as students inside the school stood watch over thecoffin of Park Rae-chun. Park was the third student to commit ritualsuicide as an anti-government protest since May 15.   Fighting erupted after a procession of students bearing Park'sbody marched from a Seoul hospital.   In the southern city of Taejon, students tried to march out ofHannam University, but were driven back by riot police firing teargas.   Radical students held peaceful rallies at other colleges in Seouland other cities to prepare for a march Friday to North Korea in anattempt to unify the two Koreas.   ``March to the border to realize unification and drive out theforeign forces from our land,'' said a leader at a rally at JoongangUniversity in Seoul.   National Police Director Cho Chong-suk said the march plans werea threat to national security and that students defying the ban onthe march would be arrested and prosecuted.   ``Any attempts to take part in the action or any other illegalacts will be dealt with severely,'' Cho warned in a statement.   Up to 60,000 riot police will be deployed to prevent studentsmarching from Seoul to the border and to step up security around keygovernment buildings and college campuses, police officials said.   Radical students planned to march to the border truce site ofPanmunjom, which is off limits to civilians, to meet with NorthKorean students.   Opposition parties urged the government to hold talks withstudent leaders to reach a peaceful settlement rather than resort toa violent crackdown.   But the opposition disagrees with the march, saying contacts withNorth Korea must be left to official channels.   Police arrested 148 students in Seoul on Sunday when they triedto go to the edge of the Demilitarized Zone between the two Koreasfor a rally to promote Friday's march.   The radicals, a small but powerful minority on campuses, insistthat the two Koreas must be reunited at all costs. They say they arenot pro-communist.   Student leaders claim the United States enforces partition of thepeninsula, divided since 1945, so it can rule South Korea as avirtual colony. Radicals have been demanding the withdrawal of the42,000 U.S. troops based here under a defense pact.   But many South Koreans believe North Korea is determined toforcefully unite the peninsula under its control.   North Korea, which invaded South Korea in 1950 and sparked theKorean War, has staged attacks against South Korea over the years.</TEXT></DOC>
