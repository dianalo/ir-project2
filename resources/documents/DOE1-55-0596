This report provides relevanttechnical data for use by DOE and its supporting contractors and is notintended to be a policy document. This document is backed up by fivePC-compatible data bases, written in a user-oriented, menu-driven format,which were developed for this purpose. The data bases are the LWR AssembliesData Base; the LWR Radiological Data Base; the LWR Quantities Data Base;the LWR NFA Hardware Data Base; and the High-Level Waste Data Base. Theabove data bases may be ordered using the included form. Volume 6 containsdecay tables for immobilized high-level waste, information on interimhigh-level waste forms, and a user's guide to the high-level waste PCdata base.</TEXT></DOC>
