RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court, in a ruling welcomed inWestern states, said Tuesday states may tax businesses for oil andgas extracted from Indian reservations.   In a 6-3 decision in a case from New Mexico, the justices saidsuch taxes neither illegally infringe on the rights of Indians nordo they amount to illegal multiple taxation.   The court upheld New Mexico's authority to tax oil and gas takenfrom the Jicarilla Apache reservation there. The levies werechallenged by Cotton Petroleum Inc., which also pays taxes to thetribe for the extracted minerals.   ``Today's ruling is a substantial and rather profound victoryfor the state of New Mexico,'' said Gov. Garrey Carruthers.   New Mexico collects about $19 million a year in such so-calledseverance taxes from oil and gas and coal production on Indian landin New Mexico.   The court ruling also is good news for officials in Arizona,Montana and Utah. There are some 150 cases in the four states inwhich businesses with Indian mining leases say they are victims ofillegal multiple taxation _ by a state and a tribe.   Justice John Paul Stevens, writing for the court, rejectedarguments that the New Mexico tax interferes with tribal economicdevelopment by prompting producers to look off Indian reservationsfor mineral deposits.   He said a 1938 federal law, the Indian Mineral Leasing Act, doesnot specifically pre-empt the power of states to tax oil and gas onIndian lands.   ``Any impairment to the federal policy favoring the exploitationof on-reservation oil and gas resources by Indian tribes ... issimply too indirect and too insubstantial to support'' a claim thestate tax is pre-empted, Stevens said.   He also said that Cotton Petroleum, which has a lease with theApaches for oil and gas on the reservation, is not subject tounfair double taxation.   ``It is, of course, true that the total taxes paid by Cotton arehigher than those paid by off-reservation producers,'' he said.``But neither the state nor the tribe imposes a discriminatory tax.The burdensome consequence is entirely attributable to the factthat the leases are located in an area where two governmentalentities share jurisdiction.''   The high court in 1982 ruled that the Jicarilla Apaches mayimpose their own severance tax on oil and gas extracted from theirreservation.   Stevens noted Tuesday that New Mexico provides services toCotton Petroleum on the reservation.   There is no constitutional requirement that the services thecompany receives be equal in value to the amount of taxes it pays,Stevens added.   The Constitution does not demand that ``benefits received from atax authority by an ordinary commercial taxpayer ... must equal theamount of its tax obligations,'' he said.   Finally, Stevens said, the Apache tribe is not a ``state,'' andtherefore Cotton Petroleum is not subject to multiple statetaxation.   In a dissenting opinion, Justice Harry A. Blackmun said NewMexico is increasing its revenue ``at the expense of tribaleconomic development.'' That violates federal policy, expressed inlaws and regulations, to protect Indian self-determination, he said.   He was joined by Justices William J. Brennan and ThurgoodMarshall.   Cotton Petroleum challenged taxes on oil and gas taken from some15,000 acres of land on the Jicarilla Apache reservation.   The company pays taxes to the tribe amounting to about 6 percentof its production, and New Mexico levies taxes on the companyamounting to 8 percent of its production.   Cotton Petroleum noted that oil and gas producers in the statewith deposits taken from non-Indian land only pay 8 percent intaxes.   The company said it paid $2.3 million in taxes to New Mexicofrom 1981 through 1985 but received only $89,000 in services fromthe state.   The Jicarilla tribe was not a direct participant in the case. Itfiled a friend-of-the-court brief expressing its opposition to thestate taxes.   In other decisions, the court:   _Upheld a 1986 federal law imposing ``safety user fees'' onpipeline companies that transport natural gas and hazardousliquids. In a case from Oklahoma, the court said the law does notgive the executive branch too much of Congress' power to imposetaxes.   _Tossed out a dispute from Minnesota over the federalgovernment's power to ban newspapers from publishing lists ofwinners in privately run lotteries. The court said the case is mootbecause the government no longer intends to enforce the ban.</TEXT></DOC>
