It's not drama. It's not typical TV comedy. It's a collection of six quirky, offbeat vignettes -- an anthology of half-hour situation-based comedy sketches, each with its own writer, director, actors.    It's also one talent-packed series. Created by Jon S. Denny and executive produced by KCET's Phylis Geller, &quot;Trying Times&quot; is crammed to the gills with stars and heroes of the more-or-less avant-garde. This includes Rosanna Arquette, David Byrne, Candice Bergen, Jeff Daniels, Swoosie Kurtz, Teri Garr, Jessica Harper, Tim Matheson, Catherine O'Hara, Ron Silver and Steven Wright. Among the directors are Alan Arkin, Jonathan Demme and Michael Lindsay-Hogg. Established younger playwrights such as Beth Henley, Spalding Gray, Christopher Durang and Wendy Wasserstein wrote the scripts.    What holds the six episodes together is a shared theme, a shared look: Each story is framed by an introduction and a postscript in which the characters -- standing in front of a gray, back-lit backdrop -- talk right at us, explaining their predicaments, commenting on the way they feel. These monologues, interwoven with the story line, give the show a modern edge.    The action is hypermodern -- 1980s characters with 1980s fears, doubts and out-and-out paranoias. Each of the skits tackles a minor trauma: getting a job, moving, meeting a fiance's parents or a husband's former girlfriend.    In &quot;Drive, She Said,&quot; Ms. Garr plays a young art-history professor (specialty: Faberge eggs) who is deserted by her boyfriend. Deciding she has to get her life in order, she makes a To Do list: brush up on conversational Portuguese, jog every day, lose 10 pounds, become fulfilled. But first of all, she has to learn to drive.    Mr. Wright is 30, and he's still struggling with a Ph.D. dissertation on the Punic Wars. When his parents finally pull the financial rug out from under him, he has to give up his thesis and &quot;Get A Job.&quot; But he has a suspicion he's not cut out to be a fire chief, or a nurse, or a backhoe operator.    In &quot;Moving Day,&quot; Ms. Bergen is a divorcee trying to start a new life. She has to put up with the sudden arrival of one daughter who's just dropped out of school, another who's a punkette -- and pregnant -- and a father &quot;whose mind is fighting a losing battle with time.&quot;    And Mr. Gray is a man who just can't get to sleep. His girlfriend's biological clock is ticking away, and it's keeping him up at night. But how can he bring a child into this bitter world with its rapidly diminishing ozone layer and its rapidly increasing nuclear arsenal?    This, of course, is Woody Allen's home turf -- &quot;the universe is expanding, so what's it all for?&quot; In fact, the six episodes, different as they are, are all Woody-worlds (unfortunately, without Mr. Allen himself). They're peopled by the high-strung and the uptight: angst-ridden white middle-class urban neurotics. None of these characters are truly bizarre (with the exception of David Byrne in &quot;A Family Tree,&quot; as the off-the-wall brother who knows everything about poisonous snakes). Most of them are just a little alienated. They can't sleep. They can't learn to drive. They can't get a job.    Now the humor in this series is played very deadpan. When it works, it really works. It can be wickedly sly, as in &quot;Get A Job,&quot; when Mr. Wright, applying for a mailroom position, fears a drug examination: &quot;Great. A urine test. I just went.&quot;    This is clearly not the 8 p.m. living-room comedy, with its sofa and its laugh tracks. These shows have an intelligence, a dry wit. Ms. Garr's fatuous former boyfriend, bragging about his new house on Hawaii, declares, &quot;I'm now tricoastal.&quot; In an interchange between Tim Matheson and Mr. Wright, Mr. Matheson describes a winning job-hunting strategy: &quot;It's simple. The company has a round hole. They're looking for a round peg to fill it.&quot; &quot;I'm not a peg.&quot; &quot;. . . Nobody's a peg, smart guy. We're human beings, each with our own unique individuality.&quot; &quot;Exactly. So how do you handle it?&quot; &quot;You forget that crap and you try acting as round as possible. You look round, you dress round, you say round things. They figure, let's get him -- he's round.&quot;    But much of &quot;Trying Times&quot; also comes off curiously flat. On his way to a job interview, for example, Mr. Wright turns to the man next to him, looks at his typical gray three-piece, and says, &quot;nice suit.&quot; With wit this dry, you need a humidifier.    And it's a little annoying that all the intelligent people in these trying times are so ill at ease, so full of self-doubt, so nervous and apologetic and ready to camp out on their psychiatrists' couches. &quot;Life as we know it is not a spectacle or a feast,&quot; says Mr. Denny, talking about his series. &quot;It is a predicament . . . melancholia, anxiety, perspiration, penis envy, saccharine, hypochondria . . ..&quot;    Ms. Garr grimaces and complains to her shrink that she feels &quot;stuck.&quot; Ms. Arquette wrings her hands and hopes against hope that her future in-laws will like her, at least a little bit. Mr. Gray contemplates suicide. They're all wimps, paralyzed with indecision. According to this series, anyone with a brain, in this modern life of ennui and existential angst, must be falling apart at the seams. And anyone who isn't biting his or her fingernails to the quick must be an airhead.    But how much kvetching can you listen to? You feel like giving these characters a swift kick in the pants. You feel like telling them: Stop that sniveling. Cheer up. Have a nice day. </TEXT></DOC>
