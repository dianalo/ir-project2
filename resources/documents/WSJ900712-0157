But maybe they didn't need to. The six men and oneIron Lady appear to already know one of the ten commandmentsof country music: Don't do tonight what you'll regret in themorning.   Such famed party animals as Helmut Kohl, FrancoisMitterrand and the world environmental movement had hoped theGroup of Seven would join them for a couple of truly wildschemes -- bailing out the collapsed Soviet economy withbillions of dollars in direct aid or committing the incomesof their peoples to solving the &quot;greenhouse effect.&quot; Neitherhappened. In fact, reports yesterday said that what kept theleaders' aides up till 4 a.m. Wednesday was work on aremarkably positive compromise on agricultural subsidies.</LP><TEXT>   We have a few caveats, but on balance, it seems that forall the heady talk about a world in transition now, theindustrial leaders handled some tough economic matters withprudence and good sense. For this outcome, President Bushdeserves some credit.   The two big issues at the summit were Soviet aid and worldagricultural subsidies. No one would have been very surprisedif Mr. Bush, a help-Gorbachev man, had signed on to some sortof plan to start aid or credit flowing toward the Kremlin.But no such cave occurred. With support from Maggie Thatcherand Toshiki Kaifu, Mr. Bush got a final communique thatreflected the plain reality of the Soviets' economicprospects: not good without &quot;radical&quot; changes.   The communique's approving use of the word &quot;radical,&quot;normally avoided by diplomats, is telling. &quot;Radical&quot; is theterm that the Soviet Union's proponents of the free-marketuse to describe themselves. Some of these radicals have beenparticularly critical of what they describe as Mr.Gorbachev's &quot;half-measures.&quot; The G7 will now send to theSoviet Union an economic team to discover what most everyonealready knows about that country's &quot;needs.&quot; It will beinteresting, and possibly even amusing, to see what thefree-market Soviet radicals make of their visitors from theInternational Monetary Fund and World Bank.   Prodded by the U.S., the communique also laid down arelatively tough foreign-policy marker as a precondition forfinancial support, despite a threat by a Gorbachev aide inrecent days that &quot;we aren't taking orders.&quot; The communiquesaid the Soviets should shift resources &quot;substantially&quot; outof the military sector and &quot;quit support to nations promotingregional conflict.&quot; Translation: Drop Castro. The Cold Warmay be over, but it's reassuring to see attention given to aproper mopping-up exercise.   The resolution of the agricultural dispute -- a commitmentto &quot;substantial reductions&quot; in export subsidies, internalprice supports and import barriers -- will keep the UruguayRound on track. But the extraordinarily hard-line positionthat the Europeans brought to Houston remains troubling.   All this talk about how their farmers are the Continent's&quot;social fabric&quot; raises the prospect of an almost medievalFortress Europe. In Houston, this issue was teed up as anAmerican-European dispute. But what message is the EuropeanCommunity sending to the farmers of emerging economies inEastern Europe, Africa, Latin America, Ukraine and Asia? Toput it politely, the message isn't attractive, and unless theGATT negotiators press hard to unwind this subsidy structure,as U.S. Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter seems intent ondoing, the global economy is in for endless conflict.   Members of the environmental congregation will howl at thesummit's disinclination to order up an immediate end toglobal warming, but the summiteers appropriately balancedsuch goals with legitimate, competing interests. Among ourproblems with the environmentalists is that they seem tothink that their agenda must supersede all the other normalconcerns of humankind -- growth, feasibility, science, costs,alternative investments (for presuming to give voice to theseconcerns, John Sununu is demonized). The G-7 nations mustfind a way to integrate themselves into a world of collapsedcommunist economies and developing nations around the globe.The useful message the Houston summit sent theenvironmentalists is that their cause is worthy but notpre-eminent.</TEXT></DOC>
