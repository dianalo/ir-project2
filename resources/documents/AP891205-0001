The military chief named a negotiator to discuss a peaceful endto the crisis with rebels who began a coup attempt againstPresident Corazon Aquino last Friday.   Mrs. Aquino had earlier ruled out talks with the rebels and toldthem ``surrender or die.'' In an emotional TV address Wednesday,Mrs. Aquino appealed to the Filipino people for support.   Speaking extemporaneously, an obviously fatigued Mrs. Aquinoasked Filipinos to turn out in the streets Friday in a show ofsupport like the February 1986 ``people power'' uprising thatpropelled her into office and drove Ferdinand Marcos into exile.   Wednesday was the sixth day of the insurrection.   ``You, my beloved countrymen, I depend on you,'' she said. ``Letus see each other on Dec. 8 and show to the world that the majorityof the Filipinos believe in democracy and will give everything theycan for progress and for peace.''   The appeal seemed to be a sign that Mrs. Aquino faces mountingpressure amid the armed challenge by military mutineers and demandsfrom her own followers for substantial changes in her policies andadministration.   ``I know that I owe my presidency to you,'' she told the people.``I did not think of being your president. I just wanted to serveyou. I just want to restore democracy. I want to respect yourrights. I am only asking you to help me. You are my only source ofstrength for me to continue our reforms in government. I alsodepend on you to see for yourself what these people are doingagainst us.''   Vicky Benito, a receptionist at the Manila Garden Hotel in theMakati district, said Wednesday morning, ``All Americans are safe.The Americans are all OK.''   The U.S. Embassy and Philippine authorities said 164 Americanswere out safely, and that the evacuatio appeared complete. Alsoreported out and safe were 70 British, 14 Swiss, 26 West Germans,17 Singaporeans, 210 Japanese, 40 Australians and 41 Canadians.   At least 77 people have been killed and more than 540 woundedsince rebel soldiers began their coup attempt.   A statement by the armed forces said the cease-fire would remainin effect ``until further orders'' in order ``to allow a smoothwithdrawal of hotel guests from the Makati area.''   But the statement by military Chief of Staff Gen. Renato deVilla also said the cease-fire was ``in connection with ongoingnegotiations'' to end the fighting.   De Villa designated Brig. Gen. Arturo Enrile, superintendent ofthe Philippine Military Academy, to talk with rebels in thefinancial district.   More than 30 buses shuttled between the battle zone and ashopping area near the airport, where evacuees were taken untilarrangements can be made for them to leave the country.   U.S. Consul Bruce Beardsley some of those evacuated would leavethe Philippines on the first available flight.   A rebel officer said Tuesday that the estimated 215 trappedAmericans might not go free because of U.S. support for Mrs. Aquinoduring the uprising, including providing air cover early in therevolt.   But a statement issued Wednesday said the insurgents' executivecommittee decided late Tuesday to free all the Americans because``these American tourists are not our enemy.''   On Wednesday, however, a statement issued in the name of a rebelleader, Brig. Gen. Edgardo Abenina, declared the insurgents were ina ``state of war.''   ``We advise the U.S. government to prepare a plan for theevacuation of its nationals as the impotent Aquino administrationmay not be able to ensure their safety,'' said the statementdistributed to news organizations.   ``We appeal to the American people to exert pressure on theUnited States government to refrain from pursuing any policy oraction which may trigger a new Philippine-American War.''   About 2,000 foreigners were believed trapped in hotels andapartments in the area, which the rebels seized Saturday on thesecond day of their uprising. ``It was slick,'' said Crosby Nash,58, of Centerville, Md., of the evacuation. He had been stranded atthe Manila Garden Hotel. ``It was a superb operation. I thinkthere's certainly relief.''   Fanny Dickins, a Briton who lives in Hong Kong, said staff atthe Intercontinental woke guests at 7:30 a.m. and told them toreport to the lobby with their smallest piece of luggage.   She said a rebel officer was in the lobby to see off theforeigners. Some of them posed for pictures with him.   ``I found them all sympathetic,'' she said of the insurgents.``They were very nice and extremely polite, all of them.''   Safe passage for the foreigners was delayed Tuesday. However,hundreds of other residents of the district were able to flee amidthe most serious coup attempt so far against Mrs. Aquino.   Wednesday's evacuation included not only foreigners andFilipinos in the area's three luxury hotels but also incondominiums lining Ayala Avenue and other thoroughfares.   Manila radio stations broadcast instructions to condominiumresidents to stay in front of their buildings until the busesarrived for pickup.   Private Filipinos offered accommodation to foreigners becausehotels were jammed with Makati residents who fled earlier.   Rafael Alunan, undersecretary of tourism, negotiated Tuesdaywith the rebel leader in Makati. Talks at the IntercontinentalHotel ended at sunset but apparently resumed early Wednesday. Therebels offered Monday to let the foreigners leave.   Earlier, insurgent Capt. Albert Yen said that ``the intention isnot to release Americans. ... U.S. meddling has caused the failureof the first wave of our assault, so we hold them liable. It is theresponsibility of the U.S. government if we take their nationalshostage.''   On Friday, U.S. F-4 Phantom jets flew air cover for loyalistforces. The planes did not fire on the rebels, but kept them fromcontinuing air strikes from Villamor Air Base. Rebels seized thebase early in the coup attempt.   In Washington, the Bush administration had expressed publicconcern for the trapped Americans.   ``You can be assured that the Pentagon has contingency plans foreverything,'' White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, butwould not elaborate.   Four hundred mutinous Scout Rangers were operating in Makati and400 other rebels still occupied Mactan Air Base in Cebu, 350 milessouth of Manila.   Brig. Gen. Jose Commendador, leader of Mactan rebels, saidTuesday a ``nationwide uprising by the military'' would result ifthe government moved against them.   Vice President Salvador Laurel said in a statement issuedTuesday in Hong Kong resignation of the government would allow for``a new mandate'' and avert civil war. Although still vicepresident, Laurel broke with Mrs. Aquino in 1987 and formed anopposition party.   Continued fighting has strained the economy and weakened publicconfidence.</TEXT></DOC>
