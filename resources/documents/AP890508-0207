Shaffer sent his family into the country for a week. When Elsiereturned, her father was building coffins for the dead brought tothe nearby United Methodist Church.   ``I remember they brought the bodies there to wash, took themacross to the church and laid them across the top of the seats,''Mrs. Frum says. ``They put a robe over them. He made the coffins tobury them in. That's what I remember. I saw all that.   ``It was horrible. I was scared to death of dead people.   ``I remember the cleanup. Every time they would dig a place fora home, they would find a body. And every time they would diganyplace, they would find something, you know, a body orsomething.''   Johnstown's dead were found miles past the stone bridge forweeks. Debris was recovered as far away as Pittsburgh, about 75miles to the west. The last body was discovered 15 years later.   Many bodies could not be identified and 663 of the unknown wereburied in a common plot in nearby Grandview Cemetery three yearslater.   In terms of lives lost, the Johnstown Flood ranks as the secondworst natural disaster in U.S. history. A hurricane that hitGalveston, Texas, in 1890 left 6,000 dead. The San FranciscoEarthquake of 1906 ranks fifth, with 500 killed.   The nation's press sensationalized the tragedy, sometimes filingfalse stories of heroism and looting. But the press also helpedmobilize quick national and international help for the strickenarea.   Within days, trainloads of food, tents, clothing, lumber,construction supplies, and even coffins, arrived. Cashcontributions from around the world totaled $3.7 million, accordingto McCullough.   Mrs. Frum remembers the relief efforts, the immediate rescue andreconstruction activity.   ``All kinds of food came in and all kinds of clothing,'' shesays.   Later, fingers of blame were pointed at the millionaires' SouthFork Fishing and Hunting Club, which had allowed the dam at theformer reservoir to deteriorate. Several lawsuits were filed and,without a lake, the club soon closed.   But, McCullough reported, ``not a nickel was ever collectedthrough damage suits from the...club or from any of its members.''   ``Every person was warned, oh, long before it broke,'' Mrs. Frumsays. ``Oh yes, they were warned. Every time it rained, they saidthe dam was going to break and it didn't. And, of course, when ithappened, why, nobody thought it was going to happen and nobody ran_ but us.''   The Shaffers were lucky. The high water flooded their house andthey returned to live in it.   But Mrs. Frum lost everything, including the contents of herJohnstown home, on March 17, 1936, when a warm rain melted heavywinter snows too quickly and the city suffered its second majorflood. The 1936 flood left 25 people dead and caused $41 million indamage.   Moving to a nearby suburb atop a mountain, Mrs. Frum missedJohnstown's third great flood on July 22, 1977, when 11 inches ofrain fell in the area in nine hours. The 1977 flood left 80 peopledead and caused $350 million in damage.   Mrs. Frum never left the Johnstown area and she has survived twohusbands. All of her 30 descendants are still alive.   ``I have wondered, yes, a lot why I'm here,'' she says. ``Iguess it's just not time for me to go. I've gone through a lot. Idon't want another flood, I know that.''   There have been other hard times for Johnstown. Stung by rapiddeclines in the steel industry, Johnstown at one point in 1983 borethe nation's highest unemployment rate, 26.6 percent, at the sametime it maintained the nation's lowest crime rate.   The city, now about 35,000 people and slowly recoveringeconomically, has planned more than 100 commemorative and specialevents this summer to mark the flood's 100th anniversary under theslogan, ``A Triumph of the American Spirit.''   ``The reason for the celebration is to show how the city hasbeen resilient, not only from the floods, but from the variouseconomic adversities,'' says Mayor Herbert Pfuhl Jr.   Referring to survivors of the 1889 flood, Pfuhl says, ``I thinkthey'd be pleased with the changes and the progress that hashappened.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, May 21</NOTE></DOC>
