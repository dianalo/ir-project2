It was the challengeof the oil crises of the early and mid-seventies, not so much the willof men which gave rise to the first solar energy programs. The physicaland technical knowledge of the properties of solar energy and the designand behavior of related equipment have substantially improved since;quite a number of utilization experiments have left laboratory scale:Thermal conversion is economically viable under certain circumstances;so are wind converters; photovoltaic panels are marketed with a yearlycapacity of 20-30 MWp; hydro-power and biomass energy are the back-boneof energy supply in developing countries. Engineers in the US and Europeare preparing for the first commercial solar tower power plants in the100 MW range; European and Arabian engineers have agreed upon first solar-hydrogendemonstration plants both in Europe and in Arabia.</TEXT></DOC>
