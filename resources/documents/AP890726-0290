(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Chrysler Corp. executives andengineers are wondering if there is a Viper in the company'sfuture, an executive said Wednesday.   A key element in whether the Viper _ a muscular two-seatersports car _ ever sees the showroom floor could be a newcomputer-aided design system, which Chrysler says slashes the timebetween design and assembly.   The nation's No. 3 automaker plans to announce within six monthsif it will produce the Viper, which snared a lot of attention onthis winter's car-show circuit.   The car, a low, sleek sports car billed as having a big V-10engine, could come to production in as little as a year and a half,said Thomas Gale, Chrysler's vice president for product design.   The Viper introduced at the winter auto shows was a devoid ofthe pricey electronics loaded into other two-seaters such as theNissan 300ZX. Mazda recently used a similar concept for itslow-priced, limited production Miata convertible, which has beenmet with torrid demand.   Gale supports the Viper. Chrysler Motors Corp. President RobertLutz wants to build it and Chairman Lee Iacocca said in a recentinterview that he leaned toward producing the car.   ``Even the bean-counters here are saying we've got to find a wayto build it,'' Iacocca said.   But there's a roadblock to the Viper _ timing.   Chrysler is developing an array of engines and a new carplatform for the 1990s. But before then, Chrysler officials arepredicting a softening of the auto market.   That could force Chrysler and other automakers to look moretoward their bread-and-butter cars and away from anything exotic,like the Viper.   One way to pare costs of developing a new vehicle like the Viperand to make it more attractive to executives is to cut the timebetween the drawing board and assembly line.   Gale said Wednesday a newly installed computer-driven designtool could slice design time from about a year to eight months.While it was impossible to tell now, it could cut as much as 25percent off the time to bring a totally new car to market, droppingthe period to three years, he said.   The tool, called the conceptual design and rendering system,began work at Chrysler's studios late last month. Its first projectwas the Viper.   Like other computers, the system gives a designer a computergenerated, three-dimensional depiction of a car. The roof line orthe shape of windows and doors can be changed on the screen, savingmodeling time.   The difference with the new system, Gale said, is that it alsoincludes specific mathematical measurements that can be translatedby a machine used to cut a full-size clay model.   The mathematical information also can be sent to other computersin engineering and manufacturing divisions, where feasibilitystudies can be performed quickly and changes can be recommended.   For example, if an engineer looks at a design and determinesthat it won't work because of aerodynamics, the computer model canbe returned to the design studio for alterations.   The system was developed by Evans andamp; Sutherland of Salt LakeCity. The company has talked about the system to other companies,including Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp., said Eandamp;SChairman David C. Evans.   ``In the past, it's been a little like a relay race,'' Gale saidof the process, in which the designer gave plans to an engineer whoaltered them and sent them to a manufacturer to determine iftooling could be made to assemble the vehicle.   ``We're changing the way the race is run,'' Gale said.</TEXT></DOC>
