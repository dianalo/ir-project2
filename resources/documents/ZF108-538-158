 Butthere are different perspectives depending on whether you are talking abouthardware or software.andP;  On the hardware side, a basic definition would behardware that follows some industry standard and/or, in terms of theprocessor, some sort of widely available chip.andP;  .  .  .andM;On the software side, you're pretty much talking about a couple of majoroperating systems--and really UNIX for the most part and severalcommunications standards that are widely available.andP;  Again, the concept isbasically that they're available from multiple sources.andM;The other thing is that we also mix DOS and UNIX a lot, and DOS I consider,to some degree, to be an open system.andP;  Even though the operating systemitself is proprietary, it's certainly widely available.andM;Q: So you determine that a product is open by weather it's available frommultiple sources?andM;A: I don't know it that's a classic definition, but, to me, the major benefityou get from open systems is vendor independence.andP;  That has a whole raft ofbenefits that come along with it, in terms of the availability of compatibleproducts--both hardware and software.andP;  In terms of giving you leverage inprice negotiations; in terms of giving you leverage in demanding betterservice, whatever.andP;  If the vendor thinks that he can be replaced by hiscompetitor because there's nothing proprietary in what he does, then itreally becomes a buyer's market.andM;Another important issue is the interoperability of open systems.andP;  We'reconstantly acquiring new pieces from new players, and the only way that'sfeasible is interoperability.andP;  We've got a terminal server today thatsupports X.25 [communications protocol] and TCP/IP [Transmission ControlProtocol/Internet Protocol], and we'll be able to integrate it to ournetworks because those are open systems or open standards anyway.andM;We have several vendors' hardware that are transparent to one another.andP;  Wehave some stuff that runs on a Sequent [Computer Systems Inc. machine], runson a Sun [Microsystems Inc.].andP;  We have ported other vendors' hardwareplatforms for evaluation, even though we're very happy with Sequent.andP;  .  .  .andO;We won't be locked in.andM;Q: How fast are you moving to open systems?andM;A: We're moving pretty fast--as fast as we can.andP;  One approach we could havetaken was to cross-compile old applications.andP;  There are PL/1 cross compilers,but the approach we took was to build everything from the ground up aroundour relational database managers.andP;  And that takes more time.andP;  We starteddoing that about a year ago, and we've got about another year to go, beforewe'll be all done.andP;  .  .  .andM;Our distribution center software, which was the first big UNIX project wedid, had to be re-developed.andP;  The first stuff we did with UNIX was to supportthe backbone of the later stuff we did.andP;  It takes a corporation a couple ofyears to make a change like this.andP;  But there's no proprietary orold-fashioned thinking involved.andP;  It's just a question of &quot;you can't getthere from here,&quot; any quicker.andM;Q: Are you looking at hardware strictly on the basis of millions ofinstructions per second (MIPS) processed?andM;A: There's a raft of things.andP;  Performance is one of the major things, but themaintenance policies, the reliability of the box, the packaging of theproduct--those are also issues.andP;  It's not like there's proprietary softwareor something .andP;  .  .  on the hardware that makes the difference.andP;  A hardwaremanufacturer wins our business by giving good value in terms of product andservice and reduces the competition to things that are more natural for thevendor to provide.andP;  A software obstacle to using a different platform is anartificial obstacle in today's day and age.andM;Q: When did you make the decision to embrace open systems?andM;A: We were developing UNIX systems that went across vendors about four yearsago.andP;  They weren't a major focus of where we were headed as a corporation interms of our major systems until a couple of years ago, though.andP;  We reallydecided we were going to standardize on UNIX, Oracle [Corp.] and Sequent;X.25, TCP/IP, NFS [Network File System].andP;  Those were really the backbone ofwhat we do right now.andM;We made a corporate commitment two years ago that our major corporatedatabases were going to be Oracle databases running under the UNIX operatingsystem, and we've been moving in that direction ever since.andP;  We will havesome proprietary stuff that we're currently porting to UNIX.andM;Q: Was there much debate within the organization before you made thisdecision?andM;A: The debate occurred on several levels.andP;  The first level was people who hada technical mindset, myself included.andP;  We were really concerned about thinglike security, the robustness of the operating system from a systemsmanagement point of view.andP;  Once we got those things behind us, the otherdebate .andP;  .  .  was the people at the highest level of the corporation sayingthat UNIX was a technical operating system and it wasn't good for thecommercial world, that the products wouldn't be there, that we really oughtto be looking at an IBM mainframe and nothing else.andP;  There was quite a bit ofthat type of thing.andM;Management consultants and outside directors really brought in that type ofargument and thinking into the company.andP;  As a matter of fact, making thedecision to go with open systems was relatively easy, not re-making it turnedout to be the challenge.andM;But then what happened was people began taking note of the decision andsaying, &quot;Wait a minute, you're going way out on a limb here.andP;  You're beingpionerers, and that's not the business of a retail firm.&quot;andP;  So there was a lotof second guessing.andM;The decision survived that debate.andP;  A major turning point in the whole debatewas the availability of first-rate financial software, the Oracle financialpackage.andP;  .  .  .  The one thing that really recommended the mainframeapproach was the availability of word-class financial software.andP;  And Oraclekind of leveled that playing field with their financial package that met ourneeds.andM;Q: Was it a big cultural change going to an open system?andM;A: I can't say that because we weren't a traditional corporation anyway.andP;  Wewere doing a lot of distributed processing anyway before we committed to theopen systems approach.andP;  We were doing time sharing, as opposed to batch-typecomputing.andP;  We were doing a lot of things that the UNIX type of operatingsystems provided .andP;  .  .  so it wasn't as much of a cultural shift as itwould be at a lot of firms.andM;We also had an MIS staff that was relatively small; the company is relativelyyoung.andP;  We didn't become a major player in the retail industry until the late'70s and into our own until the early 1980s, so there wasn't a lot ofentrenched ideas in the data processint side of things that there might be ina more mature company.andP;  We weren't a COBOL shop, for instance.andP;  So, goingfrom PL/1 to C is not a difficult transition for a programming staff, whereasgoing from COBOL to C is a tougher transition, for example.andM;So open systems really fit the way we were operating the company already.andO;It's just that, as we got to be a large company, our growth has fairlyrapid--at least for a retail chain--and there were all the traditionalpressures to roll back into a classical MIS type of approach to what we weredoing.andP;  The real challenge to us was not to go into the classical mold but totake advantage of the advent of open systems to structure our MIScapabilities in a way that was more oriented to the '90s as opposed to the'70s or '80s in terms of the application of technology.andP;  And that was tough.andM;With all the big success came the big time management consultant and thatsort of thing.andP;  And a lot of them thought we were crazy.andP;  They've come aroundnow, but then .andP;  .  .andM;Now we're getting vindicated, just in the last 6 to 12 months, by what'shappened in the open systems arena.andP;  They're now taking back some of thething they said then.andP;  Now they're saying, &quot;Well, maybe you did know what youwere doing.&quot;andM;Q: Have you seen more choices out there in the marketplace?andM;A: Yes, it happens every day.andP;  We started using terminal servers to connectserial terminals to machines on TCP/IP networks, and we decided we wanted toput those in our stores.andP;  We had 10 different vendors competing, and theprice just keeps dropping.andP;  Every time somebody comes back with a quote, theprice goes down, and/or somebody comes up with more functionality.andP;  It's oneof those situations where it's worked to our benefit.andP;  But everyday somebodycomes in with a system that would slide right into our network.andM;On the communications side, there's a raft of products, and it really isnice.andP;  There are innovations all the time.andP;  That's what's making all thesecompanies that have embraced open systems successful--as one guy comes upwith an innovation and is successful, it isn't long before there's someoneelse with another innovation.andP;  The winner is the users.andP;  We get to benefitfrom a competitive situation that server existed before in the computerindustry.andM;Q: What about the software?andM;A: There's half a dozen companies that want to sell me products that workwith Oracle's products.andP;  On the spreadsheet side, there's half a dozen there.andO;I'm looking for queuing software and there's choices.andP;  Even the lack of a lotof shrink wrapped UNIX software and the minor differences in the differentversions of UNIX don't seem to make much of an obstacle in getting what Iwant from a variety of vendors.andP;  And, it's starting to mushroom.andP;  If you'dasked me 18 months ago, how did I find the availability of software, I wouldhave to have said that there's not much out there.andP;  But I'm starting to seemore of it.andM;Q: Did your open systems decision have financial advantages?andM;A: There was never any question that the value was better in the open systemsmarketplace.andP;  The real question was if the richness of choices was going tofollow in that direction.andP;  There was a lot of software available for IBMmainframes and very little available for UNIX four or five years ago.andP;  Today,there's probably still more software for a large corporation available on anIBM mainframe environment than there is on a UNIX environment, but there's noquestion that once an application is purchased, it's more coat effective inthe open environment.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
