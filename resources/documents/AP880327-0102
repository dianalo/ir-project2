Abdel-Aziz al-Watari, acting secretary-general of theOrganization of Arab Oil Exporting Countries, said a recent Arabenergy conference held in Baghdad, Iraq, concluded that ``the oilmarket is very weak at present because of the absolute slowdown inoil demand and because projections of increase in demand havefailed to come through.''   In an interview with the Kuwait News Agency, Watari said thissituation could last for five years. He called for ``a profoundcommitment and high degree of credibility on the part of OPECstates to retain the present reference price of $18 a barrel.''   The situation, he said, also required ``a high degree ofcooperation'' from producers outside the 13-nation Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries. Seven of OAPEC's members, includinginfluential Saudi Arabia, also are members of OPEC.   On Friday, crude oil prices firmed slightly in response toreports that members of OPEC's pricing committee would meet nextmonth to discuss ways to stabilize the market.   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the May contract for WestTexas Intemediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, settled at $17.03 perbarrel, up 7 cents from Thursday's close.   Saudi Oil Minister Hisham Nazer on Wednesday called for anemergency meeting of the pricing committee amid reports some of thecartel's members have been violating production quotas and pricesdecreed by OPEC.   ``The failure of states in OPEC to stick to the productionsharing will set the stage for a price decline, and anyextraordinary increase in production could lead to the collapse ofthe price system in the foreseeable future,'' Watari warned.   In Riyadh, Nazer discussed cooperation between OPEC and non-OPECmembers with Malaysian Foreign Minister Datu al-Haj Abu al-HasanIbn al-Haj Omar, whose country is not a member of the cartel.   The official Saudi Press Agency quoted Nazer as saying thatduring the meeting, the two ministers ``reviewed the role ofnon-OPEC producers in helping stabilize the oil market.''</TEXT></DOC>
