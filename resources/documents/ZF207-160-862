(IDC), aFramingham, Mass.-based market research company.andM;But currently less than half the networks in the United States have formalsupport, according to a survey of 280 large user installations across thenation done by Technology Financial Services (TFS), a market research companyin Westford, Mass.andM;&quot;There's a growing need for network management; that's why it's a hot topic.andO;But the usage of formalized network monitoring is less than half, and that issomewhat surprising,&quot; said Harry Henry, a principal at the market informationdivision of TFS.andM;&quot;If these people have gone through the expense of putting in the networks, itsurprises me that not many put in network management.andP;  It's expensive, but soare the networks,&quot; Henry said.andM;The TFS report also found that fewer users than expected were concerned aboutstandardization in the network management arena.andP;  &quot;Less than half therespondents are concenred about network management systems being compatiblewith standards,&quot; Henry said.andM;&quot;My rough guess is that people see the standards issue as a motherhood [and]flag-waving issue.&quot;andP;  Standards are important &quot;when it comes to talking to thepress and talking at conferences, but when it comes down to the userhs ownparticular situation, [standards] aren't as important if [the network]works,&quot; he said.andM;There is a trend toward protecting the networks while vendors are producingmore flexible services, according to reports published by IDC.andM;&quot;It's hard to tell how fast [network management] is growing, but we know thatpeople today that have a network of any size are either [installing some sortof network management system] or looking real close,&quot; Henry said.andM;Henry predicted that the network management business will boom for the nexttwo years and longer.andP;  &quot;All the remaining networks aren't going to beabsorbing maintenance network systems in two years, and like any business, itwill grow over time and be enhanced and modified, so it's a continuingbusiness opportunity,&quot; he said.andM;IDC puts network management users into three categories: financial services,manufacturing and nonprofit-government.andM;Financial services companies responding to IDC's surveys preferred networksupport consisting of user-vendor partnerships with in-house services.andO;Manufacturing companies preferred vendor partnerships and servicecontingencies negotiated at the time of equipment purchase.andP;  Nonprofit andgovernment organizations preferred in-house support and system integratorsubcontracts to keep track of their networks.andM;According to Henry, DEC has been a little slow on the draw where networkmanagement is concerned.andP;  The TFS report shows IBM's NetView rapidly pickingup market share, but DEC is not keeping up, Henry said.andP;  &quot;DEC hasn't keptpace proportionally with their pace in the system market,&quot; he said.andM;All reports showed that speed of response and repair is the user's number ofone concern.andM;Having problems with a computer network is &quot;just like a phone network[shutting off] or internal mail going down.andP;  If people can't effectivelytransmit data because there's too much traffic on the network and you don'thave something to reroute that,&quot; the company slows down, Henry said.andP;  Thenetwork has down, Henry &quot;essential to how a company operates,&quot; he said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
