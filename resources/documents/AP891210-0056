(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   North Carolina's first wintry storm of theseason killed seven motorists, knocked out power to thousands ofhouseholds, and toppled two television towers before moving out tosea Sunday.   Towers for WPTF-TV and WRAL-TV, both Raleigh stations, collapsedSunday within a half-hour of each other, spokesmen for the stationssaid. The towers stand side-by-side in Auburn just south of Raleigh.   Witnesses said it appeared that melting ice destabilized thestructures. WPTF estimated the damage to its 2,000-foot tower at $6million and said it could be weeks before the station would bebroadcasting at full power.   ``I heard something. It sounded like ice...and ... I saw itfolding up just like an accordion or folding ladder,'' said SueWilliams, a resident who lives near the towers.   Adjacent to the two, a tower for WTVD-TV of Durham was leftleaning to one side under the weight of the ice.   The storm blew in Friday, dumping several inches of snow in thestate's northern mountains, and began crawling across NorthCarolina, spitting sleet and glazing roads with ice.   The ice wreaked havoc on the state's electrical lines, whichbroke under the weight of ice and falling tree limbs.   ``This is one of the most severe storms we have had. In someareas ... in Roanoke Rapids there are probably three, possibly fourinches of ice. It's not snow. It's ice,'' said North Carolina Powerspokesman Randy Shillingburg.   Shillingburg said 9,500 of the utility's 90,000 customersremained without electricity Sunday, most of them in theWilliamston and Ahoskie areas, and in rural areas adjacent toRoanoke Rapids.   Some households and businesses had been without light or heatnearly 24 hours, he said.   Duke Power Co. said 10,000 Charlotte-area customers weretemporarily without power.   Carolina Power and Light Co. spokesman Wayne Ennis said 3,600 ofthe utility's customers remained without electricity Sundaymorning, mostly in the Fayetteville, Henderson and Warrenton areas.   Utility officials said ice is more troublesome than snow.   ``We've got dozens of strands of wire down, hundreds of treesand tree limbs. You could liken the damage as a result of an icestorm to more like a hurricane or tornado than anything else,''Shillingburg said.   Police across the state reported hundreds of traffic accidents,at least seven of them fatal, as cars slid on streets thatresembled ice-skating rinks. Four motorists were killd Saturday andthree Friday.</TEXT></DOC>
