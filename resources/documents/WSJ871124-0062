Three men invade a country mansion, burn four occupants alive and then rape and strangle the fifth.    British newspaper readers, long accustomed to a drumbeat of overblown crime stories, have been getting harder stuff lately. Behind the current spate of violent crime is an unprecedented rise in lawlessness that has driven the crime rate in England up by 70% in the eight years of Margaret Thatcher's government.    Britain's top law enforcement officer, Home Secretary Douglas Hurd, is scrambling to mollify critics, promising stiffer controls on carrying knives and a curb on violent television shows, especially those imported from the U.S. Crime, he explains, has been going up all over the world. &quot;It's much worse in the U.S,&quot; he declares.    Nevertheless, London's vaunted Scotland Yard has been absorbing more and more resources while solving an everdwindling percentage of crimes. In London, street robberies have shot up 250% and reported rapes by 330% during the Thatcher years.    &quot;The Tory record on crime is appalling,&quot; says Roy Hattersley, a member of Parliament who watches the issue for the opposition Labor Party. He predicts that Labor will soon establish itself as the &quot;law-and-order&quot; party.    There is talk that England's cities will become another Los Angeles or New York. In some ways, despite what Mr. Hurd says, it is already more risky here.    A comparison of 1986 crime statistics between London and New York City shows that a Londoner out for a stroll has only about one-fifth the risk of being robbed and one-seventh the risk of being murdered that a New Yorker takes.    While the Londoner is out, though, the chances his home will be burgled are almost 50% higher than in New York, and it is more likely someone will break into or steal his car.    What is going on here baffles some experts. Lord Lane, the Lord Chief Justice of England, has noted that in the 1930s when Britain was plagued by high unemployment and worse poverty, &quot;You had no need to lock your house when you went shopping.&quot;    Michael G. Maxfield, a University of Indiana criminologist who has been hired by Mr. Hurd's Home Office to explore the growing fear of crime, finds that while Britons are less exposed to violence, they have come to fear it here at levels approaching those measured in major U.S. cities. This, he asserts, gives the issue its political punch.    In South London's Clapham Division, Barry Critchley, a Scotland Yard police officer with 22 years on the force, explains how his beat has changed. What was once a quiet, down-at-the-heels neighborhood has turned into two distinct social areas: restored Victorian town houses for the newly rich face rows of graffiti-scarred public housing for the poor. Racial tension, a fact of life in Clapham since a riot in a nearby neighborhood in the early 1980s, is growing worse.    Now professional burglars work in the neighborhood during the daytime. In the evening, muggers stalk commuters on their way home from the subway.    Mr. Critchley is still a hero to young children and elderly women who live in the public housing, which is populated largely by African and West Indian immigrants. But the teen-agers give him hard looks. &quot;When they get to be 12 or 13, they all stop talking to me,&quot; he says. &quot;It is as if they've been brainwashed.&quot;    Clapham's chief superintendent, Patrick S. Probert, gets the toughest problems. One night he meets with a group in a church to try to resolve a problem posed by one block of public housing. Despite three police raids, heroin, marijuana and cocaine are still being sold there.    Mr. Probert explains that Clapham Division police and the leftist-dominated borough of Lambeth -- which is the local governing body for non-police matters including housing -- are not on speaking terms, so he can't get the occupants evicted.    (Asked about this, Julian Lewis, who heads the borough's police committee, counters: &quot;Sometimes the police give us inaccurate information. We have to check these things out.&quot; Mr. Lewis, who is white and a socialist, has accused the police of &quot;trying to criminalize the black community.&quot;)    In the church meeting, Mr. Probert asks the president of the project's tenants' association, a slim nervous woman, to ask the borough council to kick out the drug dealers. &quot;You know we're living at risk,&quot; she responds. &quot;I certainly wouldn't want to be involved in working with the police.&quot;    Getting black police recruits is another daunting task facing Scotland Yard. Despite a five-year recruitment effort, the London police force is still 99% white. Audrey Murray, a black social worker who runs a child-care center in Clapham, says it is not entirely the police's fault. &quot;If someone says they want to join the police force, it would seem very strange to their friends,&quot; she says.    At the same time, Mrs. Murray admits, fear of crime problem in her neighborhood has grown enormously. &quot;It's becoming the norm now. If you ask somebody, they will tell you that somebody in their family has been mugged.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
