But in an acrimonious hearing before the Senate JudiciaryCommittee yesterday, the nominee, U.S. District Judge KennethRyskamp, conceded that he regretted making certain commentsfrom the bench during at least one civil rights lawsuit.</LP><TEXT>   Scores of advocacy groups -- representing minorities,women, Jews and senior citizens -- have opposed JudgeRyskamp's elevation from the federal trial court in Miami tothe federal appeals court in Atlanta. At yesterday's hearing,Senate Republicans defended the 58-year-old nominee as a fairand talented judge.   It isn't clear whether Senate Democrats have the politicalmuscle or determination to convince a majority of theircolleagues to reject the nomination. The hearings areexpected to continue today, with a committee vote notexpected for at least three weeks.   Democrats grilled Judge Ryskamp on a number of cases hehandled in his nearly five years on the trial bench. In a1987 civil rights case, which involved black men bitten bypolice dogs, Judge Ryskamp had asserted that robbers gettheir hands lopped off in some countries and that &quot;it mightnot be inappropriate to carry around a few scars to remindyou of your wrongdoing in the past.&quot;   Judge Ryskamp told the Judiciary panel that, inretrospect, he probably wouldn't use the same words or &quot;evendiscuss the subject.&quot; But in his testimony, the embattlednominee insisted that none of his actions or statementsindicated insensitivity to racial or gender bias.   In regard to the police-dog case, Judge Ryskamp noted thattwo of the bitten men were convicted criminals, and that the&quot;pain of being bitten by a dog&quot; might deter them from futureillegal acts. He went on to defend his earlier courtroomcomments as reflecting the &quot;irony&quot; that upholding the men'scivil rights might undermine the effect of their criminalpunishment because they would &quot;feel vindicated.&quot;   Noting that he has received the backing of the AmericanBar Association, Judge Ryskamp accused his critics of making&quot;false and distorted charges&quot; against him. He invokedChristian religious teachings, as well as the Constitution,when condemning discrimination as illegal and morally wrong.   In addition to citing a number of civil rights cases inwhich Judge Ryskamp's rulings had been reversed on appeal,Democrats attacked his longtime membership in the RivieraCountry Club in Coral Gables, Fla. Although Judge Ryskampresigned from the club last week, he denied widespreadallegations that it has excluded blacks and Jews. He told thepanel yesterday that he had tried to sponsor one blackapplicant, but that the man decided not to join.   The nominee acknowledged that he had resigned from theRiviera club in reaction to criticism of his nomination and,even then, only at the urging of Jewish friends and Sen.Orrin Hatch (R., Utah), a staunch supporter.</TEXT></DOC>
