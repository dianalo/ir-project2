At a securities analysts' meeting here, IBM said production has been stepped up to meet the demand for its PS/2 machines. &quot;Our production people in Austin (Texas) and Boca Raton (Fla.) have been working flat-out to meet the demand,&quot; said William Lowe, president of IBM's Entry Systems division.    &quot;It will be a record year in terms of (unit) volume and revenue&quot; for IBM personal computer sales, Mr. Lowe said. He added that IBM has increased its sales forecast for the machines since the April 2 introduction of the PS/2 line.    The analyst meeting, which began at 3 p.m. EDT, set off a rally in IBM shares in the final hour of trading. In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, IBM closed at $164.875 a share, up $1.625, and was the third most-active issue with 2.2 million shares changing hands.    Earlier this month, rumors were widespread that the PS/2 line was selling poorly and that its new operating system -- the software that controls the basic functions and promises enhanced capabilities for the IBM computers -- would be delayed. The operating system is scheduled for delivery in early 1988.    The rumors were fueled partly by reports that some major computer retailers would report sluggish results for the second quarter. In the first quarter, personal computer sales were strong industrywide, but sales slowed early in the second quarter as IBM's big customers paused to evaluate the new machines. Some computer retailers and analysts also cited the brisk sales of an IBM rival, Compaq Computer Corp., as evidence that the marketplace wasn't embracing IBM's new machines.    But Ned Lautenbach, president of IBM's distribution unit, told analysts that &quot;demand is strong across the board,&quot; referring to the breadth of IBM's new product line. He added that, like the first quarter, the first half would be &quot;the best in IBM's history&quot; for personal computer sales.    Mr. Lowe said IBM has an order backlog of about 500,000 PS/2 units. IBM's PS/2 manufacturing plants, which now include a third facility in Raleigh, N.C., end each workweek &quot;with essentially no finished-goods inventory,&quot; Mr. Lowe said.    The IBM executive said that the two basic configurations of its Model-80 computers, which are based on Intel Corp.'s powerful 80386 chip, are now shipping about a month ahead of schedule.    In addition, the operating system that taps the new machines' power could be available sooner than expected, Mr. Lowe said. The OS/2 operating system from Microsoft Corp. was originally scheduled for delivery during next year's first quarter. The availability of the special IBM-designed version of the operating system, which will give the new computers features that makers of less expensive compatible machines can't easily copy, will be announced in the fourth quarter.    Mr. Lowe also indicated that most of IBM's old personal computer line will be phased out by the end of the year. IBM already has ceased producing its basic desktop machines and recently stopped taking orders for certain models of its PC/ XT machines. Mr. Lowe said the XT models based on Intel's 80286 chip would be phased out within the next three months. IBM hasn't decided when it will stop making its popular AT/339 model, which continues to sell in large volume.    Mr. Lowe also warned manufacturers of the less expensive compatible computers, known as clone makers, that IBM would take legal action against them if they copy proprietary features of the new machines. For example, all the new models, except for the Model 30 units, include a proprietary &quot;bus&quot; -- the data path along which certain key parts within the computer and external products communicate with each other -- that gives the new machines a unique identity.    The PS/2 machines already are being deeply discounted by dealers, helping fuel the speculation that sales have been sluggish. But some dealers attributed the cuts mainly to competition -- both among themselves and with IBM's direct sales force. For example, some dealers eager to meet sales requirements to become authorized PS/2 vendors quickly slashed prices after the machines' April 2 introduction, said Rick Inatome, president of Inacomp Computer Centers Inc., Troy, Mich.    According to some industry analysts, IBM recently has regained -- at least temporarily -- some of the business it has lost in recent years to clone makers. IBM's share of the market for personal computers in May increased to 28% from 21% in April, said InfoCorp, a market research concern. PS/2 unit sales accounted for 15% of the market, according to InfoCorp. (IBM's Model-30, which won't run the new operating system, accounted for two-thirds of that share, however.)    Meanwhile, there are signs that some big IBM customers have completed their evaluations and plan to buy the new machines in volume by the end of the year.    A Gartner Securities Corp. user survey indicated that 40% of the companies that own both IBM and IBM-compatible machines &quot;expect to purchase only PS/2 (units) in the future.&quot; Travelers Corp., for instance, is planning to purchase the PS/2 computers exclusively, after installing any remaining older models. &quot;Whatever is in inventory we'll use up, and then we'll go forward with the new product,&quot; said Joseph Brophy, a senior vice president with the Hartford, Conn., insurance company.    Some companies apparently are moving more cautiously, however. Texaco Corp. has authorized -- but isn't requiring -- departments to purchase the PS/2 units. &quot;We don't buy a bunch of things because they're new,&quot; explained E.D. McDonald, a division manager. &quot;It's competing for its place in the network&quot; with other computer makes, Mr. McDonald said. </TEXT></DOC>
