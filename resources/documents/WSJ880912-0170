In the past, Mr. Lichenstein has criticized the U.N. for failing to live up to the ideals of its charter, which includes the maintenance of international peace and security. Now that the U.N. has clearly helped resolve several conflicts, heretofore intractable, Mr. Lichenstein attacks U.N. peace-keeping as not cost effective. Can he really have it both ways?    As a military man, I learned firsthand that peace is cheaper than war, whether in dollars and cents or in human suffering and lives. I am therefore encouraged by the realistic possibility of just and lasting settlements in the Persian Gulf, Afghanistan, the Western Sahara, and Angola/Namibia. Reagan administration policies have been essential to moving these disputes from the battlefield to the negotiating table. So has the mediation of U.N. Secretary-General Perez de Cuellar.    The U.N. Security Council and General Assembly have also played key roles in forcing those responsible for these conflicts to accept negotiated settlements. Security Council Resolution 598, ordering an end to the hostilities between Iran and Iraq, demonstrated to both sides that the international community was willing to adopt unprecedented measures to halt this brutal, senseless war. And the annual resolutions of the General Assembly condemning the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia showed dramatically just what the world thought of these actions.    Peace-keeping in the U.N. is composed of two elements: debate, which permits nations to confront one another verbally rather than with weapons; and mechanisms for negotiating and enforcing the settlement of armed disputes. This all takes money.    It is simply not enough to fund deployment of the U.N.'s blue helmets to a war zone. It is also necessary to pay for the forums that allow negotiations to take place. It takes money to provide meeting rooms and interpreters. It takes money for the secretary-general and his staff to shuttle between belligerent nations in the search for peace. If the U.N. is to continue to operate these facilities, all its members -- including the U.S. -- must help by paying their dues.    The U.S. has insisted that the U.N. cut unnecessary expenditures, reduce excess personnel, and practice administrative discipline. Our efforts have met with substantial success. Last year, for the first time in history the U.N. approved a budget lower in real terms than the preceding one. This spring the secretary-general produced a revised personnel staffing table that showed a 12% reduction from existing levels. The mechanisms for other reforms have been put in place. Of course, there can be no &quot;guarantee&quot; that all U.S. concerns will be met in the near future. Nevertheless, the U.N. has made significant progress toward putting its administrative house in order.    I therefore believe that Mr. Lichenstein's &quot;modest proposal&quot; -- that the U.S. pay its share of peace-keeping costs but refuse to pay its regular U.N. assessment -- is a prescription for failure, in both U.N. peace-keeping and U.S. foreign policy.
