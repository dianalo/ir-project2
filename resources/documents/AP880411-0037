The official Communist Party newspaper on Sunday quoted chiefmilitary prosecutor Boris S. Popov as saying officials were tryingto stamp out evasion of military service, theft, damage of militaryequipment and other crimes.   Pravda said the military had not been exempt from the stagnationand corruption that Mikhail S. Gorbachev is trying to stamp out ofSoviet society.   Violations of laws and military regulations had become habitualamong some commanding officers and political officers, he said. Thefines were levied in the past two months against an unspecifiednumber of soldiers, Popov said.   Some soldiers were found to be renting private apartments andliving outside barracks and stealing or damaging military property,Pravda said.
