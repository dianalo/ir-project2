The Energy Department is brainstorming on a laundry listof proposals for conserving energy, increasing domesticproduction and switching fuels that is a far cry from theCarter days of thermostat controls and crash programs tobuild synthetic-energy plants.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Americans everywhere must do their part,&quot; President Bushsaid yesterday, plugging energy conservation in his televisedexplanation of why he's sending troops to defend oil-richSaudi Arabia.   The proposals, which are still undergoing changes butcould be sent to the president's desk later this week, rejectthe concept of new regulations, gasoline-rationing plans orprice controls. Instead, they focus on ways to removebarriers to production and rely more on carrots than sticksin encouraging energy conservation.   One of the most controversial ideas on the list isdropping the speed limit back down to 55 miles per hour,which would save 100,000 barrels of oil a day. Theadministration isn't endorsing the idea, an Energy Departmentofficial said, but wants to present all options and leave itup to the White House to decide what's politically feasible.   In the end, it also will be up to the White House todecide whether there's enough of an energy shortfall to issuea national call for more conservation and domesticproduction, similar to President Carter's famous cardigansweater address in which he called the 1979 energy crisis the&quot;moral equivalent of war.&quot;   Another measure would encourage fuel-switching byindustries; estimates are it could replace 160,000 barrels ofimported oil a day. Higher prices have already begun topersuade industries, many of which adopted dual-fuel capacityafter previous energy crises, to switch from oil to moreplentiful natural gas. Energy Department officials said theyare trying to identify ways to remove barriers, such astransportation problems, that could inhibit fuel-switching.   Simply asking Americans to inflate their car tires tomanufacturers' specifications could save 70,000 to 90,000barrels a day. Other advice is: don't top off gasoline tanks,double up on car trips, and drive the more efficient car ifthere's a choice.   &quot;There are a number of things that could be done thatdon't impair people's lifestyle, but if we did enough of themit would make a difference,&quot; said Linda Stuntz, deputyundersecretary of energy for policy. &quot;It sounds almost hokey,but it really could make a difference.&quot;   On the production side, the Energy Department isconsidering ways to boost sagging domestic output, includingasking states to delay or relax specific environmental anddrilling regulations that reduce production for the durationof a shortage, said Ms. Stuntz.   Department officials in particular are studying the new$2.5 billion Point Arguello oil-drilling project off thecoast of Santa Barbara, Calif. The project's three drillingplatforms, built by a consortium led by Chevron Corp.'sChevron U.S.A. Inc., are ready to pump as much as 100,000barrels of oil a day, but the company can't get the oil toshore because it can't get state and local permission tobuild a pipeline or use tankers because of environmentalconcerns.   Ms. Stuntz said ways are being explored to try to free upthe production, including perhaps involving the Coast Guardin ensuring the safety of tankers. &quot;We're trying to turn overevery rock we can find. There aren't that many places wherethere's that much production virtually available at the turnof the tap.&quot;   The department hasn't yet totaled how much imported oilcould be offset by the measures it has in mind. The list isstill subject to review by Energy Secretary James Watkinsbefore going to the White House.</TEXT></DOC>
