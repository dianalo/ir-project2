(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The federal Bureau of Land Management isdisputing a Senate subcommittee's finding that the nation's largestindependent oil producer stole more than $30 million worth of crudeoil from Indian lands.   The agency said it took independent measurements on oilshipments from one-quarter of the 917 Indian land leases involvingKoch Industries Inc. across the country and found just three minordiscrepancies. The company had been accused of deliberatemismeasurements to avoid paying royalties.   In a report published Wednesday, the agency said it carried out460 inspections on leases and lease agreements involving KochIndustries both before and after the May 1989 hearings by theSenate Select Committee on Indian Affairs.   On another 42 randomly selected leases, the bureau comparedpurchaser and producer measurement records with the productionfigures reported to the federal government, and no discrepancieswere found, the report said.   And on Monday, the Osage Tribal Council said it completed areview of Koch Industries Inc. purchases in Osage County, Okla.,for 1987, 1988 and the first five months of 1989 and found that``overpayment of royalties by Koch were made as well asunderpayments.''   The net amount owed was about $22,000, plus $7,057 in latepenalties, the council said.   During that period, Koch Industries bought 10 million barrels ofOsage oil and paid $33 million in royalties for it, it said. Thediscrepancy amounted to less than one-tenth of 1 percent.   Koch Industries's executive vice president for legal andcorporate affairs, Donald L. Cordes, said both investigations were``in marked contrast to the shallow, selective and biasedinvestigations reported to the Senate subcommittee in thesensationalized hearings of last spring.''   Two former Koch employees told the subcommittee they werepressured to steal oil from wells on Indian land. The companyexpected them to mismeasure oil from the wells so that Koch did nothave to pay for all it got, they testified.   The company rebutted the allegations, saying the subcommittee'sfigures were inaccurate.   Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., who was chairman of thesubcommittee, was not available for comment Thursday, a secretaryin his office said.   Koch officials maintained from the start of the controversy thatfactors such as temperature, crude oil composition and holding tankconditions make precise measurement of crude impossible.   The company also suggested an ongoing Koch family feud mighthave led to the subcommittee's findings.   The subcommittee heard testimony from an investigator hired byWilliam Koch, the son of the company's founder. Koch sold hisinterest in Koch Industries in 1982 as part of the out-of-courtsettlement of a lawsuit in which he and others attempted to gaincontrol of the company. His brother, Charles Koch, is KochIndustries' board chairman.   Koch Industries, based in Wichita, has interests in energy, realestate, manufacturing and cattle. It is one of the nation's largestprivately held corporations with annual revenues estimated at$16-18 billion, and employs more than 7,000.</TEXT></DOC>
