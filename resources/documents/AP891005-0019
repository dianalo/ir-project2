Thousands of East Germans chanting ``We want out!'' had flockedto train stations and lined tracks in their homeland in hopes ofjoining their compatriots aboard what could be the last freedomtrains to the West.   West German journalists said they heard unconfirmed reports ofserious injuries when East German authorities stopped some EastGermans from getting aboard the trains.   Western diplomats in Prague, the Czechoslovak capital, hadspeculated that attempts by East German authorities to prevent thethrongs from boarding the trains had caused the delays.   East Germans seeking to board the trains jammed Westernembassies, swam rivers and lined railroad tracks in at least fourEast bloc nations Wednesday.   On Tuesday, East Germany's hard-line leaders had for the secondtime in less than a week agreed to allow safe passage to the Westfor thousands of would-be emigres who had massed at the West GermanEmbassy in Prague.   The first of eight trains that had left Prague late Wednesdayarrived in this border town at 5:50 a.m. It was believed to becarrying at least 1,000 people.   East Berlin on Tuesday said it would allow one more exodus ofdisillusioned citizens, then suspended visa-free travel toCzechoslovakia, the only country to which East Germans could gowithout first obtaining government permission.   The agreement covered an estimated 11,000 weary refugees who hadconverged on West Germany's embassy in the Czechoslovak capital,but there were reports thousands of others throughout the East blocwere hoping to take part.   A crowd of Czechoslovaks applauded as the first group left theembassy area to board buses to the train station. Helmeted riotpolice arrived and pushed the onlookers back.   As the first of 15 trains left Prague, the ecstatic passengerscheered, waved and hurled their now-worthless East German moneyfrom the windows.   Earlier in the day, thousands of people in Dresden, EastGermany, were forced by truncheon-wielding police to leave thetrain station.   East Germany closed its border with ally Czechoslovakia in a bidto end the embarrassing exodus of its young, skilled citizensbefore the Communist nation celebrates its 40th anniversary thisweekend.   ``We knew it was our last chance,'' one East German refugee saidabout fleeing to Prague. ``We were right, now the border isclosed.''   The clampdown on travel also was likely to severely curb thenumber of East Germans going to reform-minded Hungary, whichspurred the exodus last month by allowing thousands of East Germansto pass through. The shortest route to Hungary from East Germany isthrough Czechoslovakia.   West German border guards noted that only 500 arrived viaHungary on Tuesday, compared to 700 the day before and 1,000 theday before that.   East Germans were frantically trying other avenues to reach WestGermany, where they are granted automatic citizenship.   In East Berlin, police Wednesday scuffled with about 50 EastGermans trying to enter the U.S. Embassy, witnesses said. Eighteenothers made it inside the compound Tuesday but agreed lateWednesday to leave the compound with assurances their governmentwill look favorable on their emigration requests, diplomats said.   Police beat people with truncheons to disperse a defiant crowdof 5,000 that packed a Dresden train station and lined the tracks,chanting ``We want out!'' witnesses told The Associated Press.   The trains traveled through East German territory via Dresden toHof. The detour through East Germany was requested by East Berlinauthorities so the refugees could be formally expelled from theircountry. Czechoslovakia had vowed not to let East Germans emigrateto the West across its borders.   According to reliable East German sources, four East Germansstill were seeking asylum in the West German mission in East Berlin.   There were also unconfirmed reports that four East Germans hadsought asylum in Bonn's embassy in Sofia, Bulgaria.   In Warsaw, Poland, the number of East Germans seeking asylum atthe Bonn Embassy swelled to 400. About 130 arrived Wednesday. Many_ their clothing still wet _ told of swimming rivers and evadingborder police to get to the embassy.   East Germany's state railroad provided the trains to transportthe 10,000 East Germans who had crowded the Prague embassy andstreets just outside it. The trains had been scheduled to leaveTuesday night but were repeatedly delayed.   West German officials first said technical difficulties appearedto be the reason. However, later they said it could have been dueto the East Germans lining the tracks in their own country hopingto join the exodus.   ``That would be a plausible reason _ that some people perhapswould have wanted to jump on the trains going by,'' West Germangovernment spokesman Hans Klein told the ZDF television network.   Police in Hof said about 1,000 young East Germans were waitingalong the tracks near Plauen, an East German town near theCzechoslovak border.   Hungarian and West German media reported thousands more hadcrowded other spots along the route the trains were expected totake.   On Sunday, about 7,000 East Germans arrived in West Germanyafter East Germany allowed thousands crowded in embassies in Pragueand Warsaw to leave. Many of those who arrived said they had jumpedon board as the trains passed through their homeland.</TEXT></DOC>
