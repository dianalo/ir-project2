BussStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 02/25/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> GM F C AMO HMC NSANY TOYOYAUTOS, AUTO PARTS (AUT) </IN><DATELINE> DETROIT  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Sales of new U.S.-made cars fell 26% in mid-February, disappointing some analysts who had thought sales were rebounding from a weak start this year.    Domestic car makers sold 188,001 autos Feb. 11 through last Friday, compared with 253,907 in the year-earlier period. The auto companies had posted a 1.3% unit-sales decline in early February compared with the 1986 period, after sales had fallen 33% for all of January compared with a year ago.    Sales of General Motors Corp. cars had the largest percentage drop, 38%, to 91,716 cars from 148,068 a year earlier. Chrysler Corp. sales decreased 15% to 26,130 autos, compared with 30,683, and Ford Motor Co. sales fell by 7.9% to 59,225 cars from 64,274.    What makes the slow sales rate significant -- especially if it continues -- is that auto sales have been the only major weak spot in an otherwise healthy retail-sales picture. Excluding cars, January retail sales were about flat last month; including autos, retail sales plunged 5.8%. Many economists say auto sales are the big question mark for the economy in the next several months.    Analysts noted that the comparison with the year-earlier mid-February period was difficult because sales were strong then, as many buyers purchased cars to beat the expiration of some relatively generous incentive offers by the Big Three car makers. For the 1986 period, cars were sold at a robust annual rate of 8.9 million units, adjusted on a seasonal basis according to a Commerce Department formula.    But industry officials and some Wall Street analysts nonetheless were disappointed by the 6.8 million-car annual sales rate for mid-February this year, which was down substantially from a rate of 7.8 million cars for early February. &quot;The period wasn't up to my expectations,&quot; one internal auto-company analyst said.    Some analysts said the mid-February figures simply were in line with their longer-term forecast of continued sluggishness in the U.S. auto market. &quot;It would have been a little naive of us to hope that it would be up, up and away&quot; after early February's relatively high annual sales rate, said Charles J. Brady, an Oppenheimer andamp; Co. analyst.    Overall, the sales picture remained uncertain. Some analysts said mid-February results confirmed that the auto companies' current mixed bag of incentive programs isn't strongly drawing buyers because consumer confidence and some other economic indicators are declining. Some maintained that the market still was affected a bit because many potential buyers had made their car purchases in December to beat the expiration of sales-tax deductions under the revised U.S. tax laws.    &quot;The jury's still out on whether this weak market results from tax-reform dislocation or a weak underlying market,&quot; said Scott Merlis, a Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. analyst.    One thing was certain: GM continued to have troubles. Its share of the market for domestic models declined to 48.8% from 58.3% a year earlier and from 53.3% in early February of this year.    One auto-company analyst said that each of the Big Three trimmed surplus inventories during mid-February, but that GM's car stocks remained the largest, an estimated 105-day supply. A supply of 60 to 65 days is considered comfortable. The analyst estimated that Chrysler's supply was less than 100 days and that Ford had an 82-day supply.    Some analysts predicted that the No. 1 auto maker -- which has been slashing production significantly for the past several weeks -- either would have to pare output further or beef up its incentive offerings.    GM has scheduled some important new-product offerings this year, beginning with next month's introduction of its Chevrolet Corsica and Beretta compact cars. Mr. Merlis of Morgan Stanley said such new offerings will help GM, &quot;but the problem is they won't comprise GM's whole product line.&quot;    ---                           Feb. 11-20     Feb. 11-20                              1987           1986     x-%Chg    GENERAL MOTORS CORP.
