says Jerry Braun, marketingmanager at Integrated Automation Inc., a systems integration division ofLitton Industrial Automation Systems.andP;  &quot;The primary challenge is thesoftware, which is 90 percent of the integration task,&quot; he says.andM;Integrated Automation builds document-management systems for manufacturingcompanies.andP;  The systems are typically used to store and retrieve engineeringdrawings.andP;  For the optical element of its configurations, the company buysjukeboxes from Cygnet Systems and Hitachi America Ltd.andP;  Most of the disks are12-inch units, although the company also integrates 5-1/4-inch drives.andM;The hardware integration task in most of IA's projects invloves linkingterminals to workstation servers (typically from Sun Microsystems Inc.) viaEthernet or fiber-optic data distribution interface (FDDI) connections.andP;  Theservers are in turn connected to optical jukeboxes via SCSI, which is thedominant interface for optical disk drivers.andM;IA writes document management software that runs on the workstation servers,as well as on a management server, which is typically a Digital EquipmentCorp.andP;  VAX running a central database.andP;  As do most systems integrators, IAwrites building blocks of code that can be migrated from oneoptical-integration project to another.andP;  The company is currently working ona terabyte-level engineering document-management system for Boeing Co.andM;Why WORM?andM;Why write once optical disks?andP;  &quot;DAT [digital audio tape] is too new, and[conventional] tape is too slow,&quot; explains Braun.andP;  Retrieving images on tapewould take minutes; with the write once optical jukebox configuration,retrieval is typically 3 to 4 seconds when a magnetic cache is used, or 5 to30 seconds without a cache, according to Braun.andM;Although erasable, or rewritable, optical technology offers advantages inapplications where rewritability is a plus, most systems integrators take await-and-see attitude about it.andP;  &quot;Ultimately, we'll go with erasable if thetechnology comes down in price.andP;  Right now, the technology's not there,&quot; saysBraun.andM;Furthermore, for many applications, the nonerasability of WORM drives is anadvantage, sometimes even a requirement, particularly in applications thatrequire audit trails.andP;  Consider Petrocom Engineering Inc., a consulting andsystems integration concern in the petrochemical industry.andP;  Petrocomintegrates write once optical-based archival systems for attributed drawingfiles and database files.andP;  Some of the company's larger customers includeMobil Oil Corp. and Texaco Inc.andM;Petrocom chose write optical because it wants a permanent archive for a20-year plant history.andP;  For this application, rewritable optical drives wouldhave been a drawback.andM;In a typical Petrocon-integrated setup, the optical system stores drawings ofinstruments in an oil refinery.andP;  The drawings include such instruments aspressure gauges and flow gauges.andP;  The company locates WORM drives throughoutthe factory and has written an artificial intelligence program to audit thefiles.andM;Rewritable optical was out of the question because the application requiredunalterable archive files.andP;  And &quot;tape would have been much too slow and thecost per megabyte would have been much higher,&quot; says Mike Kaschek, MISmanager.andP;  Petrocon integrates 900M-byte, 5-1/4-inch drives from ToshibaAmerica Inc. with DOS- and OS/2-based machines.andP;  The cost per megabyte,according to Kaschek, is less than 60 cents.andM;Software's a bearandM;Agreeing with other systems integrators, Kaschek says that optical hardwareintegration is &quot;a piece of cake&quot; due to the SCSI connection.andP;  However,writing software for the optical drives presents a problem because mostoff-the-shelf code is in an embryonic stage and is often geared towardmagnetic media.andM;Petrocon solves that problem with a mix-and-match combination of custom andoff-the-shelf software that includes its own AI program, a variety ofstandard DOS applications and optical-disk software from Advanced StorageConcepts Inc.andP;  Kaschek offers one caveat to the use of standard DOSapplications with write once optical disks: Not all applications workproperly.andM;The software from Advanced Storage Concepts is interface code that managesthe optical disk.andP;  The program emulates the DOS file structure, which causesa lot of overhead (Mini-Micro systems, December 1988, Page 76).andP;  However, inthe case of Petrocon's applications, overhead isn't a problem because,according to Kaschek, &quot;The media is so capacious and cheap, overhead is aninsignificant problem.&quot;andM;Advanced Storage Concepts also bundles its write once optical software insubsystems with drives from Toshiba and Maxtor Corp.andM;Slow access timesandM;The key to writing code for managing optical disks is to minimize seek times.andO;From a drive perspective, access and seek times are slow compared toWinchesters.andP;  For example, 5-1/4-inch rigid disk drives boast access times ofless than 20 milliseconds.andP;  In contrast, 5-1/4-inch WORM drives rangeanywhere from 50 milliseconds to over 200 milliseconds.andP;  However, softwaredevelopers can optimize those times with tailored code.andP;  Petrocon currentlyachieves about 45-millisecond access times with the Toshiba drives and itssoftware schemes and expects to achieve 8-millisecond to 12-millisecondaccess times by year-end.andP;  Toshiba's stated average seek time for thosedrives is 90 milliseconds.andM;Slow access time is the most common complaint about WORM drives.andP;  To overcomethat drawback, some systems integrators combine the best of both worlds byintegrating Winchesters with optical disk drives.andP;  In such configurations,the fast-access Winchester is used for active, or frequently used, files,while the optical drive stores inactive, or infrequently accessed, files.andM;Best of both worldsandM;Explains Chuck Holland, engineering vice president at Epoch Systems Inc.,andO;which sells the Epoch-1 InfiniteStorage server, &quot;Usually, 75 percent of thedata on a Winchester is not actively used.andP;  We transfer that data tooptical.&quot;andP;  To users, the storage configuration looks like a very large rigiddisk drive.andM;Epoch uses 5-1/4-inch write once drives and jukeboxes from Hitachi.andP;  EachHitachi jukebox holds 48 cartridges, with 600M bytes per disk, for a totalstorage capacity of 20.8G bytes.andP;  A high-end Epoch Model 150 can support fivesuch jukeboxes.andM;Epoch's integration scheme puts the Winchester and optical drives on the sameSCSI bus.andP;  The systems work with any worksation that supports Sun's networkfile system (NFS).andM;Epoch chose write once optical technology because tape would be much too slowfor most of its applications.andP;  And rewritable optical drives would provideonly a slight advantage in those applications: that is, when updated, oldfiles clog the disk.andP;  In those cases, users could erase the old files andfree up more disk space.andP;  &quot;Nevertheless,&quot; says Holland, &quot;some customers askfor erasable.&quot;andM;As is the case with most optical disk systems integrators, Epoch'svalue-added expertise is in its file system software.andP;  &quot;We completely choppedup the [Berkeley UNIX] 4.3 file system to maintain control of files and tomake the optically stored files appear as magnetic files to users,&quot; explainsHolland.andP;  The Epoch system maintains directories and pointers on magneticdisk.andM;Home-made file systemsandM;Setting up file structures on write-once optical disks is a tricky problem,particularly in the UNIX world.andP;  That's because the way in which UNIX handlesdevices makes it more difficult to create a transparent file system with itthan with DOS.andP;  As a result, systems integrators who must maximizeperformance generally go with a custom solution.andP;  Such is the case withEpoch, which uses a custom, hierarchical file system that doesn't emulate aUNIX file system and has very low overhead, due in large part to the factthat the system typically handles very large data blocks.andP;  Overhead is lessthan five percent, according to Holland.andM;Another example of a systems integrator that created a custom file structureis General Microsystems, which hooks write once optical disks to UNIX-basedmachines--via third-party SCSI host adapters--from Concurrent Computer Corp.andO;(its Masscomp line of real-time systems) and Sun Microsystems.andP;  The companyuses 2G-byte, 12-inch drives from Optimem.andM;General Microsystems supplies a variety of interfaces and allows itscustomers to maintain hierarchical file systems on the optical disks.andP;  &quot;It'snot UNIX-transparent,&quot; explains Earl Overstreet, General Microsystemspresident.andP;  &quot;We've not tried to slavishly emulate a magnetic disk.&quot;andP;  Thecompany set up a directory on the host workstation's Winchester, which speedsup directory accesses.andP;  Alternatively, customers can put the directory on theoptical disk if, say, they want to transport the disk to another platform.andM;WORM tracks Halley's CometandM;General Microsystems wrote the software that manages the optical disksbecause, &quot;Most of the [optical] software supplied by host workstation vendorsis very rudimentary, device-level stuff,&quot; according to Overstreet.andP;  Thecompany does not provide applications software, although its code caninterface to standard UNIX applications.andP;  To assist software developers,General Micro provides C-callable routines.andM;The slow access times of the write-once optical drives are not an impedimentfor General Micro's customers because their applications deal with very largedata files--usually several megabytes.andP;  Those applications includedata-intensive scientific/engineering jobs such as mapping ocean floors.andO;Another job: storing telemetry data from Halley's Comet.andM;Even though write once optical drives do have slow access times, thatdraw-back is often insignificant if the drives are used in appropriateapplications.andP;  &quot;Contrary to what most people think, access times areirrelevant,&quot; says Mason Grigsby, president of Acctex Information Systems(AIS).andP;  &quot;Access times are important only in interactive applications, or whenyou're backing up data and speed is crucial.&quot;andM;AIS is a systems integrator and software developer that builds large image-and data-management systems.andP;  One of its customers is the Internal RevenueService, which uses AIS software in its new Electronic Filing System (EFS).andM;In AIS' applications, users frequently access optically stored documents.andO;The slow access times are not a problem for two reasons.andM;First, most of AIS' customers are conditioned to slow data access from yearsof using paper and microfilm storage.andP;  Second, systems integrators putindexes in the optically stored files on magnetic disk, and thatsignificantly speeds up accesses.andP;  &quot;When people say that write once is slow,they're usually talking about applications that are more suitable forerasable optical or Winchesters,&quot; Grigsby concludes.andM;AIS uses 12-inch write once drives from Laser Magnetic Storage InternationalCo. (LMS) and Sony Corp. of America, as well as 5-1/4-inch drives fromMaxtor.andP;  AIS wrote all of its optical software, from device drivers toapplications programs.andM;Other large systems integrators prefer to buy optical systems that approachcomplete turnkey solutions, and then add customized application code.andP;  Forexample, American Management Systems (AMS) recently integrated a prototypeoptical-based claims-processing system for the Veterans Administration.andP;  Forthe VA project, AMS bought jukeboxes from FileNet Corp.andM;The FileNet jukeboxes hold 64 cartridges, with 2.2G bytes per cartridge, fora total storage capacity of 140G bytes.andP;  AMS configured the system with 3Gbytes of magnetic cache for storing active files to significantly cut down onaccess and retrieval times.andP;  With the magnetic cache, retrieval times are inthe milliseconds.andP;  Without it, retrieval times are about 30 to 40 seconds,according to Pat Farrell, a senior principal at AMS.andM;FileNet provided most of the software for the VA system, including devicedrivers, its version of UNIX and a language for writing applications.andP;  AMSwrote 100,000 lines of code.andM;Systems integrators often layer their image-management software on top ofoff-the-shelf packages that handle the optical disk.andP;  Such packages areavailable from third-party vendors.andM;For example, Applied Computer Technology layers its record-managementapplications software on top of optical software from N/Hance Systems Inc.andO;Applied Computer, which targets the pharmaceutical market, uses 5-1/4-inch,1.2G-byte write once drives from Information Storage Inc. (ISI).andM;Applied Computer sells integrated systems that include software, scanners,workstations and optical jukeboxes.andP;  A typical configuration includes ISIjukeboxes hooked up to Sun 386i workstations via a direct SCSI connection.andM;&quot;The biggest problem with optical systems is indexing the images,&quot; says ReadeHulberd, vice president of marketing at Applied Computer.andP;  To overcome thatproblem, the company wrote software that handles scanning and appendingindexes to the optically stored pages.andP;  The optical disk operating systemsoftware from N/Hance handles file system management.andM;Besides selling unbundled optical software, N/Hance is a VAR/systemsintegrator that bundles its software with drives from ISI and LMS.andM;Another example of a systems integrator that layers imaging applicationssoftware on top of off-the-shelf optical software is Robison Systems, whichtargets the medical manufacturing industry.andP;  Robison's software, acombination of off-the-shelf programs and customized code, runs on top ofoptical software from Corel Systems Corp.andM;Corel's software provides the interface for the applications programs and theoptical disk and emulates the DOS file structure.andP;  Although such DOSemulators are often accused of inordinately large overhead, Milton Robison,Robison Systems president, maintains that overhead on the optical cartridgeis no problem.andP;  The overhead problems are all in system memory, he says.andM;Robison integrates 400M-byte write-once drives from Panasonic Industrial Co.andO;and optical cartridges from Plasmon Data Systems Inc. to PCs via SCSI.andP;  Thecompany chose write once optical drives for a simple reason: Rigid diskdrives do not have enough capacity.andP;  A typical image in Robison'sapplications can consume as many as 36M bytes.andM;As is the case with Advanced Storage Concepts and N/Hance, software vendorCorel bundles its software in write-once optical sybsystems.andP;  The companyintegrates the software with drives from Panasonic, Pioneer Communications ofAmerica Inc. and Ricoh Corp.andM;Drawbacks persistandM;Once current drawback to write once optical disks is lack of media or datainterchangeability.andP;  In a closed environment where users don't exchangecartridges among drives from different vendors, lack of interchangeability isnot a problem.andP;  However, most users and systems integrators exchangecartridges, or at least would like to have more than one drive source.andP;  Inthat case, lack of data interchangeability is a severe drawback.andP;  (At leasttwo drive vendors--Hitachi and LMS--have demonstrated interchangeability.)andM;To partially overcome the lack of interchangeability, some systemsintegrators write conversion software that enables their customers totransfer data written on one optical drive to a drive from another vendor.andM;An example is Teletrack Advanced Technology Systems Inc., which integratesand writes software for storage and retrieval systems, primarily in thebanking and financial industries.andP;  One of its larger customers is ChemicalBank.andM;Teletrack targets applications that require converting mainframe data, whichis usually stored on microfilm, to optical disks via PCs and nine-tracktapes.andP;  The company writes software to read the tapes and to store andretrieve the indexed files on write once optical disks.andP;  Because some of itslarger customers need to use drives from various vendors, Teletrack wroteconversion software.andP;  The company handles drives from vendors such asLaserdrive Ltd., ISI, Maxtor and Sony.andP;  However, such conversion schemes areslow, cumbersome and costly.andM;The industry is plagued by lack of interchangeability because every drive isphysically different, most recording formats are incompatible and standardshave been slow in arriving.andP;  On the positive side, in the 5-1/4-inch WORMarena, the ANSI X3B11 committee has approved two recording-format standards:the sample-servo format--championed by Hitachi's Electronic Media Division,LMS and Pioneer--and the continuous-composite format, supported by most ofthe rest of the 5-1/4-inch WORM industry.andM;Because of lack of interchangeability and slow access times, write onceoptical disk drives will, at least in the short term, be confined largely tobackup and archiving jobs as replacements for paper and microfilm.andP;  Untilinterchange standards are settled and uniformly implemented, most analystsagree that WORM will be destined to fill niche markets, particularly thosethat demand nonerasability and security.andP;  Even if a single standard isuniversally adopted--which is unlikely--erasable optical drives will by thattime be providing formidable competition.andP;  Nevertheless, most analystspredict that the two technologies will coexist.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
