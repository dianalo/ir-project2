Walsh onthe indictment of John M. Poindexter, Oliver L. North, Richard V.Secord and Albert Hakim in the Iran-Contra case.   The grand jury indicted four defendants: John M. Poindexter,Oliver L. North, Richard V. Secord, and Albert Hakim.   There are altogether _ well, there are three counts whichinclude all four defendants.   The first is conspiracy to defraud the United States, whichconsists of a charge of three illegal objectives; the first ofthose objectives is to impair and obstruct the compliance withlegal requirements for government covert activities by organizing,directing and concealing a program of support for the paramilitaryactivities in Nicaragua by the Contras at a time when the BolandAct was in effect, and when other restrictions on covert activitieswere in effect.   I note parenthetically that it does not charge a violation ofthe Boland Act, it charges the objective of conducting unauthorizedcovert activities.   The second objective of the conspiracy as charged is the use _or is the _ the use of private individuals by the governmentemployee defendants to generate a fund which could be used withoutgovernment accountability for the conduct of covert activities,including the support of the paramilitary activities in Nicaraguaof the Contras.   And the third charged illegal objective of the conspiracy is todeprive the _ to defraud the United States by depriving it of thefull control of the Iranian initiative by using the _ by corruptingthat initiative for the diversion of funds to private individualswhere they would be subject _ where they could be used for covertactivities designated by the government employee defendants.   Q. Mr. Walsh _   A. Do you want me to give you the other charges?   Q. I'm sorry, I thought you'd done your three.   A. No, no. That's just the conspiracy.   Those are the three objectives of the conspiracy.   Then the next count on which all four defendants are named isthe theft of government property.   And that charges the embezzlement of funds generated _ of fundsand other things of value of the government generated in the Iraninitiative for _ to private persons, again, to be used forunauthorized purposes.   And the third count in which all four defendants are named is a_ is fraud by wire, which alleges again this same diversion, butalso alleges false pretenses.   Then the additional charges, there are about 13 charges ofobstruction of investigation and false statements.   These are against _ nine are against North individually, fourare against Poindexter individually.   They also include the destruction of records as part of theobstruction.   There is also a count against North on the destruction ofrecords alone.   Then there are five counts that deal with gratuities.   Two charge efforts by Secord and Hakim to supply gratuities toNorth, and one charges a gift by Secord of the security system,another charges the acceptance by North of the security system, andanother charges North (with) obstruction of our investigation bydeveloping false documents to conceal his acceptance of that gift.   The next count charges North's conversion of traveler's checkswhich he received from Calero, a Contra leader, for governmentpurposes. ...   Q. Judge, could you _   A. And the fifth _ one more. That's the last one.   The last count charges a conspiracy to defraud the InternalRevenue Service by using a tax-exempt foundation, the NationalEndowment for the Preservation of Liberty, to _ to generate fundsfor the Contras.   But would you just _ I can't figure it out what you want me todo.   Q. Put that recorder down in front.   A. Who _ who? OK.   Q. Can you tell us whether that's it now for the grand jury? Isthis _   A. Oh, no. The grand jury is not finished.   The grand jury is continuing.   This is simply an interim report.   They will be back again Monday.   Q. So there may be other indictments?   A. That will be for the grand jury to decide, what they want todo.   Q. Do you expect there will be other indictments?   A. I can't comment on their investigation, and indeed, I cancomment even less after this indictment than I could before, whichwas not very much.   Q. Is there any reason why they would continue to sit, if not toreturn indictments?   A. Well, they have uncompleted investigations.   I'm just talking in the abstract now, not saying what reasonsthey might have.   But I cannot discuss the grand jury's activities.   Q. Judge, are you happy with the indictments that you gotagainst these four?   A. I didn't hear you.   Q. I'm sorry. Are you satisfied with the indictments _   A. That's not for me to say.   That's for the grand jury to say.   Q. Is it as much as you proposed, or did you _   Q. Thank you.   Q. Thank you very much.   A. Under the present circumstances, I can't do more than discussthe indictments itself.   I can no longer talk about background material.   Q. Thank you very much.</TEXT><HEAD>End Walsh Text _ 1 Take</HEAD></DOC>
