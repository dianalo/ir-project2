Sanders came down to earth to a place in the record books andthe fiance she has never dated.   ``Everything looks so small, so different from here,'' MissSanders, 19, said Thursday after a fire truck's bucket brought herdown from the three-story-high shack where she spent 517 days withher feline companion, Pole Cat.   ``My knees are wobbly but I feel great,'' said Miss Sanders, whowas embraced by her mother, Mauri Rose Sanders.   ``Without the cat, I would never have made it,'' she said. ``Itwas pretty cramped quarters, but it wasn't so bad. I'll miss it.''   Miss Sanders' shack in the sky measured 6-by-7-by-9 feet. It hada plastic kiddie pool for bathing, a chemical toilet, televisionand a telephone that resulted in regular $300 phone bills.   Among the 1,000 people waiting on the ground for Miss Sanderswas her fiance, 25-year-old Keith Seal of Monterey, Calif.   ``She's kind of hesitant,'' Seal said. ``She's wondering what'sgoing to happen and knows she'll miss all the attention.''   The pole sitter thanked her sponsors, and accepted bouquets andcontributions. Then she climbed into a stretch limousine for adrive around town. Miss Sanders said she was looking forward to ``agood long walk and a real shower.''   She raised $10,000 for cancer research, but had hoped her effortwould bring $100,000. Her sister, Rebecca, has cancer and has beenin remission for four years.   The Tucson, Ariz., native broke the world pole sitting recordFeb. 26 when she overtook the 488-day mark set by Mark Sutton ofVictoria, British Columbia, winning her a place in the GuinnessBook of World Records.   Pole sitting runs in the family. Her mother set a record in 1959by spending 211 days in the air.   ``I'm sure she'll look back on this with fond memories,'' saidMiss Sanders' aunt, Tanya Bowles of Indianapolis. ``Maybe she saveda life by doing this. And that's about all you can ask for.''   Firefighters were on hand to make sure Miss Sanders got downsafely.   ``She's going to look up and be lonely when she passes by herenext,'' said Perry Township Fire Chief David Betzner. ``It's beenher home and when you take someone out of their home _ no matterhow much they want to go _ they're going to look back withlonging.''   However, Seal said Miss Sanders was not coming down a moment toosoon. ``I've been waiting a year for this,'' he said.   Mrs. Sanders agreed it was time for her daughter to return toearth.   ``All this doesn't seem real,'' said Mrs. Sanders. ``We want herback with us, but honestly it seems like only yesterday that shewent up there.''   Before coming down, Miss Sanders said there ``were some real sadtimes, times that were real hard.''   ``But I always knew I would make it, even when I was scared orgoing through hard times,'' said Miss Sanders, who rode out 70 mphwinds during a February snowstorm.   Miss Sanders plans to return to Arizona in May, and hopes to goto a trade school there.   Seal first contacted Miss Sanders after reading a newspaperstory about her in November 1986. They communicated, but did notmeet in person until November 1987.   ``Now that she's getting down, we have to start dating,'' saidSeal. ``I mean we're already engaged and we haven't even gone on adate.''   He predicted that the next time the couple passed by theintersection where they first met, ``I'll probably look up, thenover to her and say she was crazy for spending a year and a half ofher life up there.''</TEXT></DOC>
