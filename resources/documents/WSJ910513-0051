National Iranian Oil Co., or NIOC, which imports jet fueland gasoil to help cover Iran's domestic needs, has met withforeign companies that own stakes in Saudi Arabia's exportrefineries, such as Mobil Corp., the Royal Dutch/Shell Groupand Petrola of Greece. Until recently, Saudi Arabia and mostother Arab states in the Gulf banned direct dealings withNIOC because they backed Iraq in its eight-year war withIran. Iran has been rebuilding its refineries since the theIraqi war ended in 1988, but still has substantial importneeds because of rapid population growth.   Gulf states' relations with Iran have improvedsignificantly since Baghdad invaded Kuwait and Tehran stayedon the war's sidelines. Most now encourage direct trade withIran.                                                                                                          TOKYO STUDIES PRETORIA REWARD                                                                                                          Tokyo is reviewing its South Africa policy, after Japan'spowerful Federation of Economic Organizations urged an end toanti-apartheid economic sanctions. A business mission toSouth Africa found that Pretoria's eliminating of racial biasstructures is &quot;irreversible&quot; and that investment and tradelimits aren't needed. This raised speculation Japan couldlift sanctions next month, when some apartheid laws are to beabolished, but Tokyo said it has no timetable.                                                                                                          BRITAIN OPENS NAZI HUNT                                                                                                          Scotland Yard was told to begin seeking evidence againstalleged Nazi war criminals in Britain, after Queen Elizabethassented to a new law allowing their prosecution. The WarCrimes Act gives British courts unprecedented jurisdictionover World War II crimes in Germany or German-occupiedterritory. Investigators believe the first of more than 70suspects could face trial next year.                                                                                                          AGITATION, JUSTICE IN ROMANIA                                                                                                          Romania's ruling National Salvation Front party hasexpelled 12 dissident members of parliament who defied tougheconomic reforms. Separately, 12 imprisoned formersecret-police and Communist officials were sentenced to termsas long as five years for their roles in repressing protestsin the December 1989 revolution. Meanwhile, thousands inBucharest demanded the return of King Michael, exiled inGeneva, after state radio in a rare step broadcast hismarking the 1881 coronation of King Carol I, his grandfather,as Romania's first monarch.                                                                                                          ACADEMIC CENSORSHIP IN INDONESIA                                                                                                          An Indonesian economist agreed to revise a book that upseta relative of President Suharto. The book, &quot;Business andpolitics -- Iindonesian Economic Policy 1950-1980&quot; by YahyaMuhaimin, described a period when Indonesia's economy wasdominated by lucrative monopolies given to those close to thecenter of power -- and it angered Probosutedjo, thehalf-brother of President Suharto. The author backed downwhen he was threatened with a suit by Mr. Probosutedjo, whosaid the book implied that he had grown rich from a clovemonopoly he received due to his family connections.                                                                                                          EX-AFGHAN KING OFFERS PEACE                                                                                                          Afghanistan's exiled king, Zahir Shah, proposed a plan forreplacing 12 years of civil war with free elections and aparliamentary system. The 76-year-old has lived in Rome sincebeing deposed in a 1973 coup. He called for rebel mujahideencommanders, politicians and other figures in Afghanistan andabroad to create a temporary executive to make peace anddraft a constitution. The rebels have fought Kabul since theSoviet Union sent troops in 1979 to prop up the Marxistgovernment. Moscow withdrew 10 years later.                                                                                                          ALBANIA'S DIRE-STRAITS STRATEGY                                                                                                          Albania's Communist government, divulging dire data thatunderscore why tens of thousands of residents have fledEurope's poorest country, unveiled a program to privatize theeconomy.   Tirana has foreign debt of $350 million and a budgetdeficit of 3.2 billion leks ($543.2 million). Prime MinisterFatos Nano also told the three-week-old multiparty parliamentthat 50,000 of the nation's 3.2 million people areunemployed, and that 40,000 workers get 80% of their wages tostay idle, costing the state 73 million leks so far thisyear.   Production in 1990 fell 10% from a year earlier. Strikesand raw-materials shortages have paralyzed many companies.Agricultural output is falling sharply.   Under the new program, prices are to be liberalized,houses and some firms privatized, and state factories givengreater control over funds. Property -- though not land --will be sold through auctions and other unspecified formsstarting next month. A two-tier banking system will providefor private banks and for a central bank money-issuing role.State spending will be slashed.                                                                                                          POSTSCRIPTS . . .                                                                                                          Responding to Taiwan's lifting its state of war againstChina, Beijing said this was insufficient, urged Taipei toadopt &quot;further real measures&quot; to improve relations andreiterated its call for unification talks. . . . Poland'sPresident Lech Walesa, moving to defuse growing politicaluncertainty, said he had no plans to force changes in theSolidarity government or its increasingly unpopular economicdevelopment program.</TEXT></DOC>
