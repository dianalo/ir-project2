Bulk powder samples of the two materialswere obtained from within gloveboxes used in the routine manufactureof mixed plutonium and uranium oxide nuclear fuel. The materials werea solid solution of uranium and plutonium treated at 1750{sup 0}C anda PuO{sub 2} feedstock. Groups of rats received a single inhalation exposureto a material to achieve one of three levels of initial pulmonary burden.Rats were maintained for their lifespan to observe the biological effectsproduced. These effects were observed in the lungs of rats exposed toeither type of particle. The same types of lung cancer were producedby both particulate materials. The incidences of cancers were also similarat comparable levels of initial pulmonary burden for the two materials.The crude incidence of lung cancers for rats exposed to these materialswas not different than those reported for similar studies that used laboratory-producedaerosols of PuO{sub 2}. Using a linear dose-effect model, the relativerisk of lung cancer for rats exposed to these industrial materials was2.3 +- 1.0 (SE) at a lung dose of 100 rad. The doubling dose for lungcancers was 78 +- 63 rad to lung to median life span. 21 refs., 9 figs.,10 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
