Bush told the platform committee, ``We need to make thiscampaign a plan for the future, a statement of solutions, not anexercise in evasion. We should make our principles and our policiescrystal clear to the American people.''   He listed positions he had espoused during his campaign andsuggested they be included in the platform.   These ranged from tax credits for child care to a ban onoffshore dumping, a reduction in the capital gains tax and thedeath penalty for drug kingpins.   Before Bush's arrival, the platform committee heard testimonyfrom witnesses including Contra leader Adolfo Calero who urged theparty to renew its pledge of support for the Nicaraguan rebels.   Other witnesses, including anti-ERA activist Phyllis Schlaflyand the chairman of Ford Motor Co., lined up today to press theirviews on the committee, but the spotlight was on Bush, the man whowill carry the party's standard in the election.   ``We're just very excited by the fact that he is coming to NewOrleans and appear before (us),'' Nebraska Gov. Kay Orr, chairwomanof the platform committee, said Sunday.   Orr and Sen. Bob Kasten of Wisconsin, a co-chairman of thepanel, told reporters they expect there will be no minority planksin the 1988 platform, continuing a pattern established in 1980 and1984.   Bush traveled here from his summer home in Kennebunkport, Maine,to make an unusual personal appeal to the platform writers, meetinga week in advance of the Republican National Convention.   Today, Contra leader Calero told the committee the rebels couldrevive their dispersed army of 17,000 and bring down the Sandinistagovernment within a year ``if we receive the proper support.'' Hesaid afterward the rebels need $100 million in new U.S. aid.   He told reporters Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis, an adamantopponent of Contra aid, ``doesn't understand the Sandinistasapparently. He doesn't understand the threat they represent.''   Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, one of the crafters of theGramm-Rudman deficit reduction law, told a platform panelsubcommittee on the economy, ``If the American people knew theDukakis record clearly, he would not be elected.''   He urged adoption of a four-point plan that includes allowingSocial Security recipients to work without penalty, providingchild-care dividends, lowering the capital gains tax and giving taxbreaks to families with college-bound children.   Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah told a family subcommittee that theDemocratic plan for child care ``would throw money from the topdown, a Washington bureaucratic approach.'' He urged adoption of aRepublican proposal for child care tax credits, which would be``putting back money in the pockets of the American family.''   Kasten, co-chairman of the platform committee, said in aninterview, ``Generally speaking, I sense we're not likely torevisit in great detail some of the debates we had in '80 and '84on ERA and abortion.''   He said, however, that ``the potential for genuine controversyand division among us exists on ... day care, education, drugs,handicapped, AIDS _ issues that we didn't thoroughly hash out anddigest in '80 and '84.''   Republican leaders have said they expect their 1988 platform tofollow the same conservative lines that the GOP established in 1980and 1984 for the Reagan-Bush ticket, with some new emphasis onchild care, drugs and other emergent domestic issues.   Bush told reporters Sunday in Maine he would urge his fellowRepublicans to ``be a little more specific than the Democraticplatform committee,'' which produced that party's most generalplatform in half a century.   ``I think the country is entitled to know the specifics,'' saidBush, who claimed that the Democrats had masked their own andDukakis' liberalism.   The subcommittees _ on the economy, education, family,agriculture, energy and environment, foreign policy and defense _will spend Tuesday drafting their planks, which the full committeewill hammer out in sessions over the rest of the week.   There is no doubt the party will repeat its anti-tax increasepledge from 1984 and other tenets of the Reagan-Bush administration.   The 1984 Republican platform opposed any tax hikes and wassilent on the Equal Rights Amendment. It endorsed proposedconstitutional amendments requiring a balanced federal budget andempowering the president with the line-item veto.   The GOP platform committee has been gathering testimony aroundthe country since the end of March.   The committee will formally vote on the platform it drafts nextMonday, then present it the next day to the full convention forapproval.</TEXT></DOC>
