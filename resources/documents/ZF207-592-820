says another.andM;&quot;We've grown to a thousand employees.andP;  Strictly mini territory,&quot; says athird.andM;A few years ago, they would have been fight.andP;  But since PC Magazine's lastsingle-topic issue on accounting (September 15, 1987), some new trends inLAN-based accounting software have been rapidly changing the situation.andO;Accounting software packages are becoming enterprise management software.andO;They still keep the books, but they also furnish timely, vital data thateveryone can use without compromising the security and efficiency of the coreaccounting functions.andM;The eight packages we've evaluated are AccPac Plus, Data Pro AccountingSeries, Great Plains Accounting Series, Macola, Platinum Series, RealWorldAccounting System, SBT Database Accounting Library, and Solomon III.andP;  Allwere chosen for their robustness and their proven multiuser functionality(albeit at varying levels).andP;  The group represents a large portion of thehigh-end market, and it highlights the wide spectrum of programming languagesused for accounting: C, COBOL, BASIC, Pascal, and dBASE.andP;  We also invitedState of the Art to submit M.A.S.andP;  90 for testing, but the companydeclined.andO;For a look at other interesting products not reviewed here, see &quot;Up andComing in Accounting.&quot;andM;New uses for accounting packages include ad hoc and scheduled reporting tomanagers throughout a company, as well as operations support-on-line supportfor a telemarketing group, for example.andP;  All of these tasks require reportsquite different from conventional accounting reports.andP;  Ad hoc inquiry alsodemands an interface sophisticated enough to accommodate users who don'taccess the system every day.andM;Management reporting can't be expected to conform to regular accountingperiods .andP;  It may mix data from multiple modules, as well as posted andunposted data.andP;  Most management reporting data comes straight from themodules rather than from the general ledger.andP;  One example would be the cashposition for the next two weeks from today.andM;At the same time, audit trail requirements mandate keeping the managementreporting separate from the types of reporting required by government andfinancial institutions.andM;Enterprise management accounting puts the system at far greater risk thanoldstyle accounting especially if your operations support includes on-linesystem updates.andP;  But it can be done correctly; it just requires moresophisticated software.andM;FROM IDEALS TO REALITYandM;None of the packages reviewed here has fully achieved enterprise managementsoftware status, especially when it comes to ad hoc inquiry.andP;  But several ofthe programs-particularly Platinum and Macola-can be customized to providesuch a system.andP;  Others, such as AccPac Plus and Great Plains, fumishmanagement-reporting options that point in the right direction withoutrequiring the expensive ministrations of progarammers.andM;Having these capabilities doesn't necessarily make these systems better ataccounting than the others, but they're all at least competent in that area.andO;Yet even as you read this, hundreds of old-style accounting-only packages arebeing introduced into firms like yours, mainly because the purchase decisionswere left up to the bean counters.andP;  And why should the bean counters takeyour needs into account unless you tell them what those needs are?andM;Indeed, the effort to do so could produce a kind of company glasnost.andO;Ordinarily departments tend to become isolated: managers forget that they allwork for the same enterprise.andP;  But the process of choosing an accountingsystem should force everyone to sit down at die same table and start workingout a synergistic business relationship, both between and within departments.andM;In fact, some fin-ns staff their decision process by designing the managementand accounting reports that everybody needs.andP;  Then they look for theaccounting system that comes closest.andM;You need not be an accounting expert to use one of these systems for makingbusiness decisions.andP;  You just have to know what kind of information wouldhelp you do your job better, what form the information should take, and whenyou'll need it.andP;  Accounting systems have allowed smaller firms to operatewith a level of decision support once found only in large corporations.andP;  Theeconomies of scale are dwindling in general, and accounting software hasjoined that trend.andM;DEPARTMENTAL MANAGERSandM;Large corporations are also benefiting from accounting packages.andO;Departmental managers with profit-and-loss responsibilities need them, sincetax-law changes have made it advisable to set up departments asprofit-and-loss centers.andP;  At die same time, the trend toward decentralizationhas put more decision-making responsibilities into departments.andM;Such departments can operate their systems autonomously, feeding summary datainto die corporate mainframe.andP;  For accounting purposes, many departments thatdon't directly produce profits can be set up in a way similar to the fundaccounting used for nonprofit instiwtions.andM;Great Plains Software deserves credit for actually setting up a specialaccounting program, including product customization, for corporatedepartments.andP;  (Great Plains says, however, that most corporate customers windup using the umnodified product to cut maintenance costs.) The greatestsavings come from not using a mini, with its $4,000- to $6,000-permonthmaintenance costs.andM;SO LONG, MINI?andM;In fact, minicomputer turf is eroding rapidIy.andP;  One company bought a heavilycustomized Macola package and a Novell LAN for $120,000, amortizing it in 18months against die costs of the mini it replaced.andP;  The new system offeredimproved speed, flexibility, reliability, accuracy, and ease of training.andM;The eight packages reviewed here average about $5,000 for the set of basicmodules and a moderate number of user licenses.andP;  Some allow unlimited usersper server; ofliers try to nick you for every workstation.andP;  Be sure to pricesystems against the number of users you anticipate having.andP;  And remember thatenterprise management takes into account many light users-something per-nodepricing fails to account for.andM;Heavy customization could add up to $30,000 to the initial price of yoursetup and more down the line as you change and refine the system.andP;  You might,for exampie, add a new product line or division or change a report becauseyou didn't get it exactly right at the beginning.andM;But that's all petty cash next to mini costs.andP;  And an accounting system givesyou a decent interface to boot, though some of the mini-based micro packagesin our review still have a ways to go.andP;  Just compare the rough edges ofMacola with the elegance of RealWorld, both of which derive from the samemini-based system, MCBA.andM;GREAT LAN PERFORMANCE Great LAN performance is needed if you want to doenterprise management accounting-mr even straight accounting for many users.andO;Any kind of on-line updating obviously demands a lot of the system.andP;  So doesbasic scalability-the ability to add users with a performance degradation asclose to linear as possible.andP;  You also want individualized user-accesstemplates rather than the cruder access-level concept.andM;Enterprise management performance must be measurable in seconds and minutes,not in hours.andP;  This requires at least 286-based performance on theworkstations and a 386 server-as was true of our test setup.andP;  Keep your XTsoff the LAN.andM;Because enterprise management demands so much of the software, we developed ademanding test.andP;  It uses keyboard macros to simulate one or two dozen realusers, 70MB of data to simulate realistic loads traveling through thesystems, and an order-entry test script that maximizes contention.andP;  It tookat least 12 hours per package to test it after the software was installed andthe database loaded.andM;There were plenty of surprises.andP;  For example, we always thought that recordlocking beat file locking, but it appeared to be faster only when afile-locking system locked the file at the moment of update.andM;Some of the products surprised us, as well-most notably Solomon III, whichhas received high ratings in many reviews.andP;  It shows that great single-userperformance and impressive features lists don't always suffice for demandingmultiuser operations.andM;We didn't test support directly, but we certainly got to see how well dievendors back their products during the tests.andP;  The Great Plains team won thiscontest easily, handling every glitch with aplomb.andP;  The Great PlainsAccounting Series had a 32,000-account limit, which didn't come close to the65,000 accounts in our test, so the company actually changed die product codeto include an ample account-size option.andP;  Tbus, the ultimate beneficiary ofthe PC LAN Labs testing is you; make sure the version you get has die higheraccount limit.andP;  (Data Pro had a similiar account limit but did not change itbefore testing began.andP;  A new, more powerful version of the package is duethis fall.)andM;The Grace Under Pressure Award goes to Advanced Business Microsystems.andP;  Itsemissary stoically endured not being permitted to configure certain Novelloptions that would have improved Platinum's performance but were disallowedso as to keep the playing field level.andP;  Platinum did, however, star out withthe advantage of being optimized for NetWare.andM;PERFORMANCE POTENTIALandM;It-you used our tests on your own LAN, the results would surely differ.andP;  Butthen, that's why we ran them all together.andP;  Each product would probablyperform differently on a different network.andP;  SBT, for example, wanted to addmath coprocessors to all the CPUs, an interesting, if expensive, idea.andM;But the tests give a bottom line to each product's performance potential, andracing improves the breed.andP;  Nearly every vendor said that it was changing itsproduct in some way as a direct result of our testsnot just to beat thetests, but because none of them had ever had access to such a substantialtest instrument before, even in their own labs.andM;One last warning about performance: sometimes speed comes at the expense ofthe functionality that you may need.andP;  For example, Data Pro ran swiftly butset a 32K account limit.andP;  Also, some of the products sacrifice speed in orderto maintain comprehensive audit trails and other data safeguards, which islaudable.andP;  Just as a good automotive road test tells you what you give up ingas mileage and weight to have air conditioning, our tests give you a feelfor the overhead needed.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
