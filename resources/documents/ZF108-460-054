(Dandamp;B), owner of McCormack andamp; Dodge Corp. (Mandamp;D),acquired Mandamp;D's rival, Management Science America Inc. (MSA) for the purposeof merging the two software giants into Dun andamp; Bradstreet Software Services(DBSS).andP;  As a result, the president of MSA, John Imlay, was appointedchairman and principal executive officer and Frank Dodge, president andfounder of Mandamp;D, was designated vice-chairman of the new company.andM;Dodge subsequently left the organization and filed a lawsuit alleging that hewas driven out of office.andP;  Dandamp;B and Mandamp;D replied that they had done everythingin their power to entice Dodge to remain and claimed that Dodge quitvoluntarily.andM;The issue of whether or not Dodge left voluntarily is critical.andP;  Hisemployment contract with Mandamp;D contained a clause forbidding him to engage in acompetitive business for one year if he were to leave Mandamp;D of his ownvolition.andP;  Dodge is apparently determined to continue in the softwarebusiness and has incorporated Frank Dodge Associates Inc. for that purpose.andM;The departure of key employees is commonplace, especially, it seems, in thecomputer industry, and causes employers much concern.andP;  Can an employerprohibit a former employee from competing within the industry and fromdisclosing information acquired while in the employer's service?andM;The only way in which an employee can be prevented from competing with his orher former employer is if there exists a restrictive covenant in the contractof employment prohibiting competition.andP;  For this reason, it is crucial thatthe employer have a written employment contract with each key employee andinsert into it a non-competition clause.andM;In order for a non-competition clause to be valid, the employer must satisfythree requirements.andP;  First, it must be proved that the employer has alegitimate interest requiring protection.andP;  Second, the employer mustdemonstrate that the clause does not provide more protection than isreasonably required.andP;  Third, it must be shown the restraint is reasonablewith respect to time and scope.andM;This last is perhaps the most strictly applied of the three requirements.andO;Where the court determines that a non-competition clause is too broadlydrafted, it will be declared unenforceable as an undue restraint on trade.andO;Current caselaw indicates that a non-competition provision for longer thanthree years will not be upheld.andM;Position of influenceandM;The law also shows that the more senior the employee, the more likely theclause will be enforced, especially if the employee was in a position ofinfluence in which he or she had contact with clients or if he or she is ableto solicit business away from the employer.andM;If the employer is able to satisfy the above three requirements, the burdenthen shifts to the employee, who must demonstrate that the restriction iscontrary to the public interest.andM;The courts have interpreted the public interest to be a reasonably unfetteredfreedom of trade and competition enabling society to benefit from everyperson's labor, skill or talent.andP;  However, if the service which the employeewishes to provide is commonplace, such that competition abounds in theterritory covered by the non-competition clause, the clause will probably beenforced provided that this would not prohibit the former employee fromearning a living.andM;Nevertheless, even if the non-competition clause is found to be valid, thereremains one situation in which it will not be enforceRd.andP;  If an employerdischarges or terminates an employee without cause and without adequatenotice, all the terms in the contract, including any restrictive covenants,will cease and be unenforceable.andP;  Thus, in Dodge's situation, it is criticalto establish whether or not he left Mandamp;D voluntarily or was coerced to quit,as he has alleged.andM;Quite frequently employers &quot;encourage&quot; undesired employees to resign or quitrather than proceeding with a legal dismissal.andP;  Usually, the employerconceives of this as a cost-saving step.andP;  However, the law endows theemployee with a valuable retaliatory weapon: a claim for constructivedismissal.andM;Constructive dismissal arises from a major change in an employmentrelationship.andP;  For example, such changes as: demotion, reduced renumerationor refusal to pay, downward change in reporting functions, unilateral changein job responsibilities, forced transfer, abusive treatment, reduced workweek, unpaid overtime, compulsory leave of absence and short-term lay off.andO;Such a change constitutes a breach of a fundamental term of the employmentcontract (whether or not written), thereby enabling the employee to treatthat breach as a repudiation by the employer of the contract.andP;  The employerwill not then be permitted to rely on any terms contained in the contract,such as a restrictive covenant.andM;By being aware of the nature of constructive dismissal, the employer shouldbe able to institute a program that would effectively deal with unacceptableemployees without running the risk of a lawsuit, or at least a successfullawsuit, while maintaining the enforceability of non-competition andnon-disclosure covenants by the employee.andP;  In any event, lawsuits are costlyand disruptive.andM;Employment contractsandM;Unlike the restrictive covenant for non-competition, a non-disclosure clausedoes not have to be contained in the written employment contract (althoughthis is preferable).andP;  This is so because there are certain terms which areimplied by the law into all employment contracts.andM;One such term is the duty of the employee to maintain the confidentiality ofan employer's trade secrets.andP;  An employee cannot reveal or make use ofconfidential information that he or she had acquired from his previousemployment.andP;  However, not all information must be kept confidential.andP;  Theburden is on the employer to demonstrate that the information disclosed was atrade secret.andM;For information to be considered a trade secret, it must first have beencommunicated in confidence, either expressly or implied, and second, it mustbe information gained by the employee as a result of and in relation to hisemployment.andP;  In addition, before any action can be taken against an employee,it must be shown that the employee made an unauthorized use of theinformation to the employer's detriment.andM;A non-disclosure covenant in the employment contract will make the employeeaware from the start that he or she is not to disclose confidentialinformation and that this prohibition applies not only while employed butalso thereafter.andP;  As a result, the employee may be deterred from revealingany information in the knowledge that he or she might be potentially liablefor doing so.andM;The courts have placed a heavier burden on the shoulders of managementemployees in that they are said to act in a fiduciary capacity in relation totheir employers.andP;  This means that such employees must be particularly carefulas to the information they use after leaving an employer.andP;  The courts expectmanagement to behave more discreetly after termination and also acknowledgethe reality that such employees are privy to very valuable confidentialinformation while employeRd.andP;  This would fit the Dodge situation exactlyalthough press reports seen to date do not refer to a potential breach oftrust.andM;In summary, employers should place both a reasonable non-competition clauseand a non-disclosure clause in written employment contracts with keyemployees.andP;  Employers should not then destroy these useful protections byprecipitous or ill-advised actions that amount to constructive dismissal.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
