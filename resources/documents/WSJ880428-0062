Any imminent cuts in production -- should they develop at all -- would likely be much smaller than had been expected. The reductions would be less than those included in a plan offered Tuesday by six oil producers who aren't members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. And the cuts would remain in force only for the duration of the second quarter, traditionally a weak period for oil markets.    In a ministerial meeting beginning tonight, the 13 OPEC members will further study the offer of the non-OPEC producers to trim exports 5%, contingent on similar action by the cartel.    &quot;We think there is a very high probability they will also recommend a cut in output, but we don't know by what amount,&quot; Fernando Hiriart, Mexico's energy secretary and spokesman for the non-OPEC group, said after a second joint meeting with six members of OPEC.    Mexico and five other non-OPEC producers -- Egypt, Oman, Angola, China and Malaysia -- proposed cuts for their part totaling 183,000 barrels a day. Colombia also was a member of that group but was left out of the listed reductions because of its economic problems. The countries seek a 700,000-barrel-a-day output reduction by OPEC, which exports three-fourths of its current daily production of about 18 million barrels.    But even among the non-OPEC group, there was skepticism that OPEC would be willing to go that far. Saudi Arabia, OPEC's biggest producer, long has maintained that any further reductions in the cartel's output -- already down 40% from the 1979 peak of 30 million barrels a day -- should be limited to strict adherence to self-imposed quotas. Even Arturo Hernandez Grisanti, Venezuela's oil minister, an aggressive proponent of a cooperative effort to trim oil supplies, conceded that getting the other OPEC ministers to agree to major output cuts wouldn't be easy.    &quot;I know we have to deal with a lot of difficulties to reach a decision within OPEC,&quot; he said.&quot;That is the traditional way in which OPEC works.&quot;    Another OPEC minister who supports sharp production cuts to prop up the price of oil, Belkacem Nabi of Algeria, suggested that more modest reductions than earlier indicated might be considered because of buoyant petroleum consumption. &quot;It's not a problem of the number of barrels to cut,&quot; he said. &quot;Demand is increasing.&quot;    By last night, the anticipated cuts for OPEC -- if any action is taken at the meeting -- had dropped to about 400,000 barrels a day. That's considerably less than the 700,000-barrel-a-day cuts called for in the non-OPEC proposal. That would mean total reductions, if carried out by both groups, of between 500,000 and 600,000 barrels a day, or only 1% of the world's oil consumption.    &quot;Generally, neither side is entrenched into a fixed position,&quot; said one strategist for the non-OPEC group.    The non-OPEC authors of the bold plan to shore up oil markets began their work last February after it became apparent that OPEC no longer could maintain stable oil prices. Since then, they've met several times in London and even sent a mission to Moscow to try to persuade the Soviet Union, the world's biggest oil producer, to join them.    But at these meetings, the group found that none of them wanted to push up the price of petroleum higher than OPEC's official benchmark of $18 a barrel, because of concern that consumers might switch to other fuels and that increased exploration might bring on another petroleum glut. OPEC's actual average price is around $15.50 a barrel.    At this week's unprecedented joint meetings between OPEC and non-OPEC officials, Mexico's Mr. Hiriart said that &quot;one of the main causes for market pessimism has been the apparent lack of cohesion among oil exporting countries.&quot;    But strategists in the non-OPEC group insisted they weren't trying to create a world OPEC. Rather, they said, the goal is less volatile prices now and a better base from which to weather the oil gluts of the future. &quot;We are not a cartel or a bloc&quot; of oil producers, said Hammad Ayoub, a member of the Egyptian delegation. &quot;We are individual, independent producers.&quot;    Nevertheless, several participants in this week's meetings would like to see their intended alliance broadened further. The two groups currently account for about half of the non-Communist world's oil supplies. Such major producers as the Soviet Union, Norway and Brunei would be welcome additions, said Kazempour Ardabili, Iran's deputy oil minister.    The non-OPEC group's proposal fixes different cuts for each participant for the months of May and June -- then to be re-evaluated -- as follows: Mexico, 68,000 barrels a day; Egypt, 22,500; Oman, 27,500; China, 30,000; Angola, 20,000, and Malaysia, 15,000. </TEXT></DOC>
