(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal appeals court today refused tofree TV evangelist Jim Bakker on bail while he appeals his 45-yearprison sentence.   A three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appealsupheld a judge's finding that Bakker should remain jailed because hemight flee.   The court said it found no reason to reject prosecution evidencethat many of Bakker's followers are prepared to ``do anything forhim.''   The court also said Bakker had shown little grounds for asuccessful appeal.   The 47-year-old preacher was convicted Oct. 5 in Charlotte, N.C.,on 24 charges of fraud and conspiracy for cheating followers of hisPTL ministry of $3.7 million by selling more lifetime vacations thanhe could honor.   U.S. District Judge Robert Potter refused bail when he sentencedBakker on Oct. 24 to 45 years in prison and a $500,000 fine.   He is being held at a federal prison-hospital in Rochester, Minn.   Defense attorney Harold Bender in Charlotte did not immediatelyreturn a telephone call today.   Bakker's lawyers had argued he should be released because ofsubstantial flaws in the trial.   They have said they will argue that Bakker was denied a fairtrial because of heavy publicity, the handling of certain evidenceand erroneous jury instructions.</TEXT></DOC>
