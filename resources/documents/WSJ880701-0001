McGraw-Hill stock dropped $3.875 a share to $57.75 as many analysts criticized the reorganization, which takes effect today, as doing little to boost the company's earnings outlook.    The realignment, which shrinks the company's organizational groups to three from five, &quot;is poorly conceived strategically and isn't likely to improve operating performance,&quot; said Joseph E. Laird Jr., an analyst with Hambrecht andamp; Quist. &quot;In fact, it may prove to be modestly detrimental over the next 12 to 18 months as the company goes through chaos.&quot;    While the move indicates that &quot;management recognizes it needs to make changes, this isn't what I was waiting for,&quot; said Peter P. Appert of Cyrus J. Lawrence. &quot;If this is all they do, I'm disappointed.&quot; Mr. Appert added that he expects McGraw-Hill to take further action.    Many analysts have been disappointed with McGraw-Hill's performance in recent years and have expected some type of restructuring that would boost the stock price. Harold McGraw Jr., the recently retired chairman and a member of the company's founding family, is also said to be frustrated with the company's recent record, and there have been reports of growing tension between Mr. McGraw and Joseph L. Dionne, chairman and chief executive officer.    A McGraw-Hill spokesman took exception to the criticism. &quot;The reorganization was designed to simplify our operating structure, a move that will strengthen McGraw-Hill for the long term,&quot; he said. &quot;That's all there is to it. That is the only claim we make for it.&quot; The spokesman denied that relations between Mr. McGraw and Mr. Dionne are strained.    Meanwhile, some insiders said the streamlining will result in as many as 250 layoffs. McGraw-Hill's spokesman responded that the number &quot;sounds awfully high.&quot; The company said Wednesday that only a &quot;handful&quot; of staffers would be eliminated.    The reorganization lumps the company's flagship Business Week magazine, four TV stations and book publishing in the newly created McGraw-Hill Publishing Co. Its president is John G. Wrede, who had been president of McGraw-Hill Book Co.    McGraw-Hill Information Services Co., the second group, includes the trade magazines, construction industry data sources such as F.W. Dodge and Sweet's, and also the computer and communications company, among other things. Its president, Walter D. Serwatka, was formerly executive vice president and chief financial officer. The third group, McGraw-Hill Financial Services Co., includes Standard andamp; Poor's Corp., the Data Resources unit, commodity services and international trade. Harold W. McGraw III, 39-year-old son of the elder Mr. McGraw, is president.    The restructuring has also raised concern inside McGraw-Hill about the fate of Sandamp;P, one of the company's top performers in recent years. One Sandamp;P manager said Sandamp;P insiders fear the company may lose some of its traditional independence as a result of the streamlining.    There is also widespread concern at Sandamp;P over what insiders perceive to be the demotion of Ira Harenstein, who was president of Sandamp;P corporate information. Under the reorganization, he becomes head of computers and communications, said one Sandamp;P official. &quot;He was the most creative person in the company,&quot; the official said. &quot;The question is why did he get demoted.&quot; He added that production is down because &quot;everyone wants to know what the next step is.&quot;    Some analysts also were distressed about the departure of Howard D. Hosbach, executive vice president, Business andamp; Financial Information Cos., who insiders said was forced out of the company. &quot;I regret seeing him leave because he was one of the best executives in the company,&quot; said Kevin Gruneich of First Boston Corp.    Both Mr. Harenstein and Mr. Hosbach declined to comment. McGraw-Hill officials couldn't be reached for comment about the executive changes. </TEXT></DOC>
