When the narrow-bodied 168-passenger Airbus A320 went intoservice last month, it was touted for its computerizedflight-control system and fuel efficiency.   Its maker, Airbus Industrie, said it has more than 500 firmorders or letters of intent to purchase the A320, which uses 40percent less fuel that similar aircraft and is already the fastestselling plane in aviation history.   But Sunday's crash, which killed three passengers and injured50, raised questions about the twin-engine plane's safety.   When the plane made its maiden flight for Air France over theFrench capital last month, then-Premier Jacques Chirac called it``the most modern plane in the world.''   And Airbus Industrie, a four-nation European consortium based inToulouse that builds two other planes, plans a stretch version ofthe A320 for 1993, as well as a four-engine, long-range version.   Owned by aerospace companies from Britain, France, West Germanyand Spain, the company is widely regarded as a triumph of Europeanindustrial and technical collaboration.   In its 20 years, Airbus has carved out a substantial share ofthe big-money, high-risk world commercial airline market dominatedby U.S. manufacturers such as Boeing and McDonnell Douglas.   Airbus planes are in service with 61 airlines around the world.   But they planes have kicked up a trans-Atlantic storm over U.S.complaints of government subsidies for Airbus. In April, U.S. traderepresentative Clayton Yeutter warned the governments of thefour-nation consortium to reduce support for Airbus or face a tradewar.   He accused the four of trying to divert attention from their owndirect subsidies by criticizing the U.S. defense programs forsupporting the U.S. airline industry.   ``The central issue under discussion is subsidies for thedevelopment of commercial projects, not the amount of moneyAmerican taxpayers spend in defense of the free world,'' Yeuttersaid.   But Airbus Industrie countered that U.S. funds are actuallyintended ``to perpetuate U.S. dominance of the world market forcivilian aircraft.''</TEXT></DOC>
