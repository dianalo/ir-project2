Nearly $9.5 billion would be provided to the JusticeDepartment in fiscal 1992, a 12% increase that would restore$218 million in savings imposed by the House. The measurepromises to continue beefed-up investigations ofsavings-and-loan fraud. The Federal Bureau of Investigation'sbudget would grow to $1.97 billion, including $48 million fora facility in West Virginia, the home state of SenateAppropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd.</LP><TEXT>   Within the Commerce Department, preliminary totals lastnight indicated at least $1.7 billion being provided forNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration operationsand research, a 25% increase from funding for the currentfiscal year, ending Sept. 30. Separately, an estimated $100million is allocated to rebuild NOAA's aging fleet, andPacific Coast fishing interests have a major stake inprovisions related to the salmon and tuna industry --including the enforcement of drift-net rules affectingJapanese fishing vessels.   The expanded NOAA budget is believed to leave room for a$100 million-to-$150 million increase above the Bushadministration's $300.2 million request for weathersatellites, including the troubled geostationary, or GOES,program. Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher and industrycontractors, including Loral Corp. and ITT Corp.'s ITTInstruments, are to testify before the panel this morning.The maneuvering is also being closely watched by GeneralMotors Corp.'s Hughes Aircraft Co. unit, which builds acompeting satellite still used by Japan.   The emphasis on NOAA and law enforcement reflects thepriorities of subcommittee Chairman Ernest Hollings, who alsochairs the full Commerce, Science and TransportationCommittee and is up for re-election next year in SouthCarolina. Despite the huge technical difficulties and costoverruns in the weather-satellite program, Mr. Hollingsremains committed to forcing some solution, and the Housestrategy of cutting from the GOES program was unacceptable toa senator from a coastal, hurricane-vulnerable state.   Mr. Hollings's proposed budget for the Justice Departmentand the judiciary benefits from added funds engineered by Mr.Byrd through the full Senate Appropriations panel, but thedetailed distribution is designed partly to protect the SouthCarolina Democrat from GOP attacks at home. The Bushadministration's request for the Drug EnforcementAdministration would be fully funded, and while adding moneyto the president's budget for prison construction, thesubcommittee cut federal support for so-called death-penaltyresource centers, which assist in the preparation andexpediting of habeas corpus petitions in federal courts.   The underlying bill, totaling $22.1 billion, also financesthe State Department's budget, and here too, Mr. Hollings'sstrong-willed presence is felt. Funds for U.S.-financedbroadcasts to Cuba would be increased to nearly $39 million,and the bill mandates that the $130 million provided for theAmerican Embassy in Moscow be used to first tear down theill-fated building, which is laced with listening devicesinstalled by the Soviets.   The projected budget for the Justice Department is nearlyfour times the level of funding for the department a decadeago, as law enforcement agencies have benefited not only frompublic concern over crime but also their ability to play onhome-state politics of individual members. The extra moneyadded for the West Virginia fingerprint facility, forexample, represents an FBI end-run of sorts around the WhiteHouse budget office. Similarly, outgoing Attorney GeneralDick Thornburgh appears to have played a major role ininitiating a proposal to consolidate a prosecutor-trainingcenter at the University of South Carolina, for which $10million would be made available.   The committee action came as the full Senate last nighttook up a $21.98 billion energy and water bill for fiscal1992 reflecting significant new funding for scienceinitiatives in the Energy Department. Compromise languagegoverning the enforcement of federal wetlands regulations wasagreed to on a voice vote after negotiations between theappropriations leadership and Majority Leader George Mitchellof Maine. But on a 54-43 margin, the chamber tabled an effortto restore more than $100 million in cuts from theHouse-passed budget for cleaning up nuclear-weapons plants.</TEXT></DOC>
