The amendment also would pose a potential threat to Malaysian public-interest groups and opposition political parties that regularly publish periodicals and political tracts, several of which have been consistently critical of government policies.    The move to further restrict press freedom isn't entirely surprising. Many Malaysians expected additional measures to be introduced to curb government criticism and growing public scrutiny, especially following the nationwide crackdown in which 106 people were arrested under the tough Internal Security Act and three national newspapers were closed. Only 11 of the detainees have been released since the crackdown began Oct. 27. They were arrested amid heightened racial tensions and were branded by the government as racial and religious extremists.    Fewer Malaysians, however, expected the provisions of the press amendment, which would make the government the sole arbiter of news coverage on virtually every topic of national consequence.    To assist in checking news coverage that the government deems &quot;maliciously . . . false news&quot; that is &quot;likely to alarm public opinion,&quot; the amendment would empower the government to seek maximum three-year prison sentences and heavy fines for convicted offenders. Malaysia's minister of home affairs also would be conferred with the &quot;absolute discretion&quot; to indefinitely suspend or restrict the circulation of those publications that transgress government norms, leaving no recourse to appeal his decision or for the courts to intercede.    Lee Lam Thye, acting secretary-general of the Democratic Action Party, the country's chief political opposition group, said passage of the amendment &quot;will sound the death knell of democracy and press freedom in the country.&quot;    Several groups suggested that they may mount a campaign to oppose parliamentary approval of the amendment. But leaders of several groups opposed to the amendment said that many of their members and others are reluctant to expose themselves to the threat of detention by seeking to sway public opinion against the proposed measure. Besides, they noted, Parliament is bound to approve the amendment, because the United Malays National Organization, or UMNO, and other parties in the ruling National Front Coalition hold nearly 80% of the seats in the body.    Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad told Parliament the day after the crackdown began that racial and religious tensions had risen to unsettling levels. He called the sweeping detentions and the newspaper closings a &quot;preventive action&quot; that &quot;must be taken now to save the country from disastrous riots.&quot; Since his speech, Dr. Mahathir has suggested that he intends to abandon any pretext of liberalism. Firmer rule will mark the duration of his premiership, he remarked.    The 1984 Printing and Publications Act also enabled the government to prohibit the publication of any printed or recorded material judged to be against &quot;the public interest or the national interest.&quot; In that regard, the act was similar to legislation approved in 1985 in neighboring Singapore, which passed an amendment restricting publications deemed to have meddled in the country's domestic political affairs.    Three foreign publications have had their circulations cut sharply in Singapore, including The Asian Wall Street Journal, which is published by Dow Jones andamp; Co., publisher of this newspaper. In all cases, the publications were deemed to have interfered in the country's political affairs by refusing to publish, either in their entirety or unaltered, letters criticizing published reports.    The proposed Malaysian amendment would allow the minister to move against a publication based on his own discretion. Anybody connected with the publication -- the printer, publisher, editor and the writer -- could be charged.    &quot;It's a disturbing new piece of legislation, but I don't expect much of an uproar in Parliament,&quot; a Western diplomat said. &quot;Those who would give any opposition aren't in any position to oppose.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
