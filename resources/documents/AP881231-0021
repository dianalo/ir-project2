White House and Justice Department officials said the subpoenaswere received Friday and that until a thorough review byadministration attorneys it would be ``premature to speculate'' howReagan and Bush will respond.   North, the fired White House aide charged with conspiracy for hisrole in the Iran-Contra affair, called for testimony from thenation's two highest-ranking elected officials in subpoenasdelivered to the Justice Department.   North's trial is scheduled to start Jan. 31, or 11 days afterBush takes over for Reagan.   While declining to state directly whether they would contest thesubpoenas, spokesmen for the White House and Bush signaled theywould not automatically accept them. The Washington Post todayquoted unidentified Justice Department and White House officials assaying they would fight them.   The Post also quoted a White House official as saying that Reaganviewed the subpoena as an attempt to prod him into pardoning North.But Reagan, urged by some conservatives to pardon North, has notchanged his view that the case should be decided at trial, thenewspaper quoted the official as saying.   The newspaper, quoting sources it did not identify further, saidState Department and National Security Agency officials have alsoreceived subpoenas from North's attorney.   Statements from the White House and Bush's office called it``unprecedented'' for a sitting president to testify in court, saidthey were reviewing the legal issues, and noted that historicalprecedent would call for the witnesses to testify in writing ratherthan take the stand.   In Palm Springs, Calif., where Reagan is on vacation, a WhiteHouse statement acknowledged North's subpoena, ``seeking thepresident's testimony at the criminal trial of Oliver North. Thesubpoena also seeks the discovery of certain personal records of thepresident.''   The subpoenas were anticipated, it said. Aides to both Reagan andBush told them Friday morning that the documents would come thatafternoon, their spokesmen said.   White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk said Reagan had known of thelikelihood since Wednesday.   ``It raises significant legal and constitutional questions whichare currently being reviewed by the Department of Justice andcounsel to the president,'' the White House said in language similarto a statement released by Bush spokeswoman Sheila Tate.   ``It would be unprecedented for a president to appear as awitness at a criminal trial and it's premature to speculate on thefinal decision that will ultimately be taken, but historicalprecedent suggests any relevant information could be providedthrough written questions and answers.''   North, a retired Marine lieutenant colonel who worked for Reaganas an aide to the National Security Council, faces trial Jan. 31 forcharges stemming from the U.S. arms sales to Iran and diversion ofproceeds to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua.   He is charged with conspiring with former national securityadviser John Poindexter and arms dealers Albert Hakim and retiredAir Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord to illegally divert more than $12million in U.S.-Iran arms-sales profits to the Contras.   Justice Department spokesman Loye Miller said the subpoenas werereceived at mid-afternoon, ``one for the president and one for thevice president,'' by Robert Ross, executive assistant to AttorneyGeneral Dick Thornburgh.   Tate said Bush legal counsel Boyden Gray was reviewing thematter, but that the vice president was going ahead with a longweekend of relaxation at Camp David, Md., and planned no meetings todiscuss the trial matter. Bush and his wife Barbara arrived at CampDavid on Friday and planned to stay until late Monday.   Bush takes office as president on Jan. 20, and could claimexecutive privilege to avoid testifying on matters of nationalsecurity, which much of the North case involves.   North's attorney, Brendan Sullivan, appearing on ABC News onFriday, was asked why he issued the subpoenas. He said, ``a defenselawyer has an obligation to issue a subpoena for every person whohas relevant information about a matter in court ... The presidenthimself has indicated he has relevant information.''   In 1973, President Nixon received a subpoena to turn over WhiteHouse tape recordings in the Watergate scandal. He was not requiredto testify, but the Supreme Court ordered him to release the tapes.   The subpoena could force Bush to disclose information hepreviously has kept secret.   Bush repeatedly has refused to discuss his private discussionsand advice to Reagan on the Iran-Contra affair, other than to say heexpressed reservations about U.S. arms sales to Iran.   The congressional Iran-Contra investigating committees concludedlast year that there was no evidence Bush knew of the diversion plan.   Bush also said he was unaware of North's secret operation tosupply the Contras during the congressional ban on aid, although hisnational security adviser Donald Gregg was well informed on thematter, and Bush met three times with Felix Rodriguez, a Northoperative in the operation.   Other questions continue on how much Bush knew about thearms-for-hostages aspect of the Iran matter. He has said he did notknow about it until late 1986, but his chief of staff indicated thatIsraeli operative Amiram Nir briefed Bush on the matter in May 1986.   Bush said he was told about what the Israelis were doing, not theU.S. participation.</TEXT></DOC>
