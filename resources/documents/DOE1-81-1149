Northern blots of hepatic RNA of animals of various agestreated or untreated with glucocorticoids were probed with selected membersof this cDNA library. One of these cDNA species is to an mRNA which ishepato-specific, is present in two day old rats, is undetectable thereafterand reappears in livers of animals two weeks later concurrent with thedevelopment of the pituitary-adrenal axis. At all ages glucocorticoidadministration induces elevated levels of this hepatic mRNA. Adrernalectomymarkedly diminishes this mRNA. Hypophysectomy elevates these RNA sequencesindicating a pituitary repressor. This interesting developmental andhormonal regulation led the authors to sequence this cDNA, isolate andsequence its gene and explore its transcriptional regulation.</TEXT></DOC>
