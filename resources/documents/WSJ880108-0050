The agency approved the transfer of insured deposits of Commerce Bank, Plano, Texas, to Quinlan State Bank, Quinlan, Texas. Commerce Bank, with $40.8 million in deposits, was closed by the Texas state banking commissioner. The FDIC said Commerce Bank's sole office would reopen as a branch of Quinlan State. The FDIC said it was holding Commerce Bank's assets because it couldn't determine their value.    The FDIC also gave financial assistance to Peoples State Bank andamp; Trust Co., Ellinwood, Kan. The bank-insurance agency said it provided as much as $5.3 million in aid to offset losses in the bank's loan portfolio. The bank, in turn, agreed to share with the FDIC any recoveries it makes from loans that it has rated uncollectable, an FDIC spokesman said. Private investors added another $2.5 million to strengthen the bank, according to the FDIC.    The rescue operation came after the Kansas state bank commissioner said the bank was in danger of failing. The FDIC said the assistance was less costly than the insurance expense of liquidating the bank. </TEXT></DOC>
