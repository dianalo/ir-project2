The rains that began in November have caused widespread floodingin rural areas, swelling rivers, turning streets into streams, andvirtually isolating some villages by knocking out phone lines andbridges.   It also has severely hampered the recovery of farmers who fivemonths ago were in the throes of drought, the Agriculture Minstrysaid Monday.   Last week, eight soldiers drowned while fording a flood-swollenriver in the eastern highlands. By the weekend, police said 66people had been killed by lightning since the first storms broke.   ``We're working all hours and weekends too,'' said TembaMunyarara, a handyman who works mainly in poor black suburbs.``It's sad to see the damage that's being done but it's been goodfor me.''   It is in the countryside, where most of Zimbabwe's 8.2 millionpeople live, that floods threaten agricultural recovery after thelong drought. About 70 percent of the population depends onagriculture for income.   Likewise, the bulk of the land-locked nation's export incomecomes from cash crops such as cotton, coffee, corn, sugar, tea andtobacco.   Last year, agricultural output fell 18 percent, or $180 million,as a result of drought.   Business Trends, the Standard Chartered Bank's monthly economicanalysis, reported that the losses would be recouped with the onsetof the regular rains.   But the agriculture ministry's most recent crop and livestockreport says that in most areas, further widespread rain will ``domore harm than good.''   Cotton, peanuts and tobacco are being severely damaged, thereport said, but it predicted that if the rains ease off, Zimbabwestill can expect bumper harvests.   The report also said ample water has been stored underground andin lakes and dams to carry Zimbabwe through the coming dry season,which usually lasts from May to October.</TEXT></DOC>
