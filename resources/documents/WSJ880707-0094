Mitchell (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> PHA INS </IN><TEXT>   Unable to cope with a constantly changing work schedule, a waste-treatment plant operator at a big oil refinery dozes off in the middle of the night -- and inadvertently dumps thousands of gallons of chemicals into a nearby river.    A Dallas salesman suffering from narcolepsy -- a hereditary disease that causes frequent and uncontrollable bouts of sleepiness -- loses several customers, then his job, after clients complain that he repeatedly falls asleep at business meetings.    Sleeping problems in the workplace -- whether the result of irregular shifts or medical disorders -- are costing companies an estimated $70 billion annually in lost productivity, huge medical bills, and industrial accidents, according to the Institute for Circadian Physiology, a research center in Boston.    Though some companies are starting to deal with the problem, most know little about medical or shift-related sleep disorders -- much less what to do about them. And often they refuse to acknowledge that sleep problems are to blame in accidents imperiling workers and the public.    &quot;It's kind of too ugly. How can you admit that your nuclear-power-plant operators regularly fall asleep on the job?&quot; says Jose Gavalondo of the Center for Design of Industrial Schedules, a Harvard affiliate. The Peach Bottom Power station, operated by Philadelphia Electric Co., had to concede just that, however: Last year the plant was closed after investigators found control-room operators sleeping on night and weekend shifts.    An estimated 20 million people work in industries that maintain round-the-clock schedules. And in sleep-disorder studies, about half of the people who regularly or occasionally work late shifts say they fall asleep on the job at least once a week. In interviews with researchers, employees from the graveyard shift report tales of seeing sleeping assembly-line workers falling off their stools, batches of defective products sliding past dozing inspectors, and exhausted forklift operators crashing their machines into walls.    Sleep researchers say the body's natural sleep-and-wake cycle prevents most people from ever fully adjusting to night shifts or irregular schedules. As a result, workers on odd shifts take more sick days and are absent more often. And researchers say that after five years, people who work late shifts are twice as prone to heart attacks, peptic ulcers, and other cardiovascular and gastrointestinal diseases than those who work regular day hours.    For workers suffering from genetic or hereditary sleep disorders -- an estimated 2% of the general population -- problems in the workplace are even more difficult. Most employers know little about such ailments as narcolepsy and sleep apnea, whose victims momentarily stop breathing hundreds of times a night. Every time breathing stops, the apnea victim wakes up just enough to keep from reaching the deepest, most restful stages of sleep.    Sleep disorders, of course, are particularly frightening in areas affecting public safety. Pilots, for instance, say their inconsistent schedules often force them to snooze in the cockpit in order to get enough sleep. The National Transportation Safety Board cited pilot fatigue as either the cause or a contributing factor in 69 plane accidents from 1983 through 1986 in which 67 people died.    &quot;There have been times I've been so sleepy, I'm nodding off as we're taxiing to get into take-off position,&quot; says a pilot for Federal Express, who says other pilots have similar difficulties. &quot;I've fallen asleep reading checklists. I've fallen asleep in the middle of a word.&quot;    Like most carriers, Federal Express is unwilling to discuss its pilots' schedules and fatigue-related problems. The Memphis, Tenn.-based overnight-delivery service has never had an aircraft accident involving crew fatigue, but pilots say the company is conducting a study of their sleep habits. The company wouldn't comment on the study.    The Federal Aviation Administration is especially worried about newer jets that can stay airborne for 18 hours straight. It is considering changing the sleep and schedule regulations for pilots on all international flights to lengthen the time that they have to rest between flights.    Nurses and doctors -- especially medical-school residents -- often work several days straight with little sleep. &quot;It's clear to us it's a dangerous situation and something has to be done,&quot; says a spokesman for the New York State Department of Health. In June, the New York State Hospital Review and Planning Council adopted rules limiting medical residents to 12-hour shifts in the emergency room, with at least eight hours off between shifts. California, Hawaii, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania are considering similar measures.    For police officers, lack of sleep because of frequently changing schedules can be a matter of life or death. John Fescher, a Philadelphia policeman, says he often starts a midnight-to-8-a.m. shift already wiped out because his schedule changes so often that he can't adjust.    &quot;I'm falling asleep at red lights,&quot; he says. &quot;And here I have to push a car around for eight hours and do a job where you constantly have to have your senses about you.&quot; He says he knows his reaction time isn't always the sharpest -- including cases in which he has to decide whether or not to shoot.    For people suffering from genetic sleep disorders, the workplace can become a nightmare. Billy Ray Thompson, the Dallas salesman whose narcolepsy cost him his job, says he has been unable to keep steady employment since 1980 because of the disease. Although he is on medication, he still shows signs of the disorder. &quot;With the slurred speech and all, if I were to encounter a person like that the first thing I would think is that he was a druggie,&quot; he says.    Robert Legan, an industrial physicist for Texas Instruments Inc., hadn't slept well for several years and was no longer able to solve abstract problems as quickly as he should. &quot;I'd be trying to construct an equation, and I'd have to go look in books,&quot; he says. &quot;And even then, I'd have a hard time figuring out these things that I'd known two years before.&quot;    But last month Mr. Legan's physician sent him to a sleep-disorder center at a hospital in Dallas, where he was diagnosed as having sleep apnea. Now he's being outfitted with a device that pumps air through a nasal mask to hold his throat open while he sleeps, preventing him from repeatedly choking -- and having to wake to breathe.    Only in recent years have employers and even medical professionals begun to respond to the impact of sleep disorders in the workplace. In the past five years, for example, health insurers have started approving workers' claims related to hereditary sleep disorders just as they do for other medical claims.    Some companies have taken steps to deal with schedule-related sleep problems among workers. Dow Chemical Co., Detroit Edison Co., Pennzoil Co. and Exxon Corp., for instance, have rejiggered schedules and are giving all workers several days off between shift changes. Some have added incentives that give workers bonus time off for reaching productivity goals on graveyard shifts.    Such efforts can pay off quickly. Productivity per labor-hour at Amax Coal Co., Indianapolis, for example, jumped 10% when the company switched to a schedule that rotates workers' shifts once every 28 days, with a seven-day break before going to the new shift. The increase in productivity enabled Amax to shelve plans to invest $14 million in added capital equipment and to sharply reduce overtime.    The Philadelphia Police Department, in an 11-month experiment using fewer and less random schedule changes in one of its busiest precincts, reported a 40% decline in the rate of officers' automobile accidents on the job. Compared with the previous schedules, half as many officers reported problems with daytime fatigue, and 25% fewer said they slept poorly, compared to the previous schedules.    The city's new police commissioner, Willie Williams, says he's in favor of adopting some of the scheduling changes, but that implementing the new program citywide would be too costly. The police union, which claims that scheduling should be part of contract negotiations, has taken the matter to arbitration.    Workplace changes to accommodate sleep problems remain the exception, though. &quot;Maybe we should worry about it more as a potential problem for us, but it's not something anyone's working on or worrying about right now,&quot; says a spokesman for Greyhound Lines Inc., which runs Greyhound and Trailways bus systems.    Researchers say that as more is learned about the economic toll of sleep disorders, companies will find that they can't afford to continue ignoring the problem. Says David Kupfer, a physician and director of sleep research at the University of Pittsburgh's Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic: &quot;Megabucks are involved, and sometimes, lives.&quot;    ---                  The High Cost of Weariness    Annual economic impact of sleep problems due to workers' inability to adjust to late shifts, in billions of dollars:  Reduced manufacturing productivity                   $50.0  Increased motor-vehicle accidents                    $ 5.7  Increased coronary artery disease and heart attacks  $ 5.5  Increased industrial accidents                       $ 4.0  Increased accidental injuries and deaths at work     $ 2.5  Increase in other medical and psychiatric illnesses  $ 2.0  Employee turnover and retraining                     $ 1.0   Source: Institute for Circadian Physiology, Boston</TEXT></DOC>
