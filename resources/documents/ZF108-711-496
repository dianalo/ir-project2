EXL 320 systems running Unix System V for between four and 16users, said Helen Garamone, a spokeswoman for the Army's Information SystemsSelection and Acquisition Agency.andP;  ISSAA made the buy.andM;In addition to the 80386-based Prime systems, which an EDS official describedas super-microcomputers, the company will provide peripherals and services,including workstations from Wyse Technology.andM;EDS also will install Government Open Systems InterconnectionProfile-compliant local area networks on which the SMC systems will operate,said Randy Dove, an EDS spokesman.andM;Dove said single-user personal computers running MS-DOS and Unix also will beavailable under the SMC contract.andM;Neither Dove nor George Sibley, the company's military systems divisionpresident, confirmed whether the PCs were the Wyse machines or are to beprovided by another of EDS' 50 subcontractors.andM;As of last week, ISSAA officials were continuing to debrief losing bidders.andO;Sibley said EDS would provide more information once the debriefings wereover.andP;  He said the systems will go through acceptance tests for 30 to 90 daysbefore any are delivered to users.andM;Garamone said users in the three DOD agencies can order equipment for fiveyears and have it maintained for another three.andP;  As many as 20,000 of the32-bit Prime systems will be available under the contract, she said.andP;  Armyand EDS officials declined to comment on how many orders they expect toreceive.andM;The contract award marked a milestone for the troubled two-year procurement.andO;The Army withstood a protest of maintenance provisions in the SMC request forproposals and made a rare request for recovery of its legal fees afterwards.andM;The General Services Administration Board of Contract Appeals denied therequest for fees but left open the possibility that it might someday grantthe government legal fees if a protest is frivolous.andP;  The SMC RFP wasprotested by International Technology Corp. of McLean, Va.andM;SMC also was delayed several months when Information Systems Commandemployees mailed one bidder's documents to a competitor.andP;  An ISSAAinvestigation determined the mailing had been an &quot;honest error&quot; and that nodamage had been done to the competitive process, Garamone said.andM;The Navy also is expected to become a larger player in the multiuser arenalater this year when an RFP for a super-mini umbrella program is scheduled tobe issued.andP;  It might call for systems supporting as many as 256 users.andM;Meanwhile ISSAA last week awarded EDS and IBM Corp. Idential contracts toprovide ABP support services to the Army's Information Systems SoftwareDevelopment Centers at Ford Benjamin Harrison in Indianapolis and inWashington.andM;Garamone said the companies will provide system design and analysis,development testing, training and software maintenance under five-year,indefinite delivery-quantity contracts each valued at between $3 million and$116 million.andM;The first jobs under the contract will be the development of a transportationsysge by IBM and a financial management system by EDS.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
