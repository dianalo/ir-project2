The discovery was of new strains of the common soilbacterium, Bacillus thuringiensis, or simply B.t. Poisons ortoxins produced by B.t. bacteria are the subject of muchresearch in pest control because, unlike the syntheticchemicals they aim to replace, they are harmless to humansand other animals. Until now, however, the natural B.t.toxins that have been found have been effective against onlya narrow range of agricultural pests, mainly caterpillars.</LP><TEXT>   The Mycogen researchers, in a study published in thelatest issue of the journal Bio/Technology, said they haveisolated B.t. strains that produce toxins that kill suchdiverse organisms as amoeba, mites, flatworms, fleas, adulthouseflies, nematodes, snails and slugs.   Researchers at the San Diego, Calif., company predictedtheir discovery could lead to the development of a pestcontrol system totally based on the naturally occurringtoxins and could change the fledgling biopesticide industry.The finding also might lead to medicines that can be targetedagainst specific unwanted organisms in humans and animals,they said.   &quot;It was beyond most peoples' wildest dreams to get (apesticide system that attacked) such a significant portion ofthe million species of insects, the more than 100,000 typesof nematodes, the tens of thousands of flatworms, and thetens of thousands of protozoans,&quot; said Leo Kim, executivevice president of research at Mycogen.   Pesticides made from the B.t. toxins currently account for$107 million in sales in the U.S., and until now the industrywas counting on sales of $300 million by 1999. With the newfinding &quot;I expect the sales to be substantially more thanthat,&quot; the executive said.   G. Steven Burrill, who follows biotechnology at Ernst andamp;Young, however, cautioned against excessive enthusiasm. Hesaid the new B.t. strains will have &quot;a dramatic impact&quot; onbiopesticide sales but &quot;it is a long way between discoveryand sales.&quot; He said any new product will have to go throughthe federal regulatory maze, which, based on the pastexperience, hasn't been all that quick in giving its approvalfor commercial sale for such products.   Mycogen manufactures a variety of crop protection productsbased on the B.t. gene that produces the toxin. Last year itreceived U.S. Environmental Protection Agency approval fortwo genetically engineered pesticide products, one againstthe Colorado potato beetle and one against the diamond-backmoth that attacks cabbage and broccoli. The company holds 22of the 39 U.S. patents issued for new B.t. strains over thelast four years, according Mr. Kim.   He said that the discovery of the previously unknownstrains of B.t. underscores the diverse nature of thebacterium. Researchers at Mycogen and elsewhere hadencountered isolated cases where certain B.t. strains werefound effective against mosquitoes and nematodes. &quot;But theywere considered anomalies,&quot; he said. &quot;We didn't think therewere strains of B.t. that could be effectively targetedagainst just about everything between amoeba and nematodes.&quot;   He said Mycogen researchers isolated the novel B.t.strains from sandy beaches, household dusts, soil on top ofleaves and other soil samples collected from 50 countries.The strains were processed in its laboratories in the U.S. incollaboration with Japanese scientists.</TEXT></DOC>
