The stock offering marks a further step in RJR's yearlongcampaign to reduce its debt and increase its equity. Thetobacco and food company has said that proceeds from theoffering will be used primarily to retire some of itshigh-risk, high-yield junk bonds, which carry 17% interestrates.</LP><TEXT>   In a sign of brisk investor demand for RJR stock, thecompany late yesterday expanded its offering to 100 millionshares from the 75 million that it had originally planned tosell last month. The stampede for RJR shares is another signof how hungry investors have become to buy stocks since themarket took off in January.   Money managers said demand appeared to be extremely briskamong small individual investors, many of whom know RJR forits brands, such as Winston and Salem cigarettes, Oreocookies and Ritz crackers. Large institutional investorsyesterday also bought heavily, though some expressed concernabout the increase of more than 100% in RJR's stock pricesince the issue was first listed in February.   With the offering, RJR will have about 270 million shares,or 25% of its stock, in public hands. Most of the remainingshares are owned by investment partnerships controlled byKohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. KKR, a leveraged buy-out firm,acquired RJR in February 1989 in the largest buyout ever.   RJR's new equity issue is the biggest stock offering by aU.S. company since March 1987, when Consolidated Rail Corp.sold $1.46 billion of stock in its initial public offering.It's also the first $1 billion common equity offering of anykind in the U.S. since 1988, according to IDD InformationServices Inc. In 1988, several large closed-end investmentfunds were launched on the New York Stock Exchange.   RJR's stock rose 37.5 cents to $11.50 a share in compositeBig Board trading yesterday. Volume was about 4.2 millionshares, making it the second most actively traded issue.Today's trading, when the newly issued shares begin changinghands, is likely to be several times that.   Shortly after trading finished yesterday, Standard andamp;Poor's Corp. said it was upgrading RJR's credit ratings,affecting $13 billion of debt. The rating upgrade, which hadbeen signaled to some extent by Sandamp;P a month earlier, assignsa double-B-plus rating to RJR's senior debt, and adouble-B-minus rating to its subordinated debt. That stillleaves RJR's bonds in the speculative, or junk, category. Butthey are far closer to investment grade than when the companywas taken private in 1989.   In seeking buyers for the new RJR shares, underwriters ledby Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. in recent weeks have staged lavishinvestor presentations throughout the U.S. and in Europe andJapan. At those presentations, RJR executives provided biginstitutional investors with a summary of RJR's progress inreducing debt and increasing operating profit.   Underwriters said last night that 69 million shares weresold in the U.S., 24 million shares in Europe and sevenmillion in Japan. Underwriters also said that RJR hasreserved the right to sell another 15 million shares underthe current offering if demand continues brisk.   Several big investors said they were attracted to RJR onthe belief that the company's management is improvingefficiency and profitability. &quot;This is a company that Ialways regarded as a loser,&quot; said Kenneth Heebner, aportfolio manager at Capital Growth Management in Boston. &quot;Ithink they're a winner now.&quot;   Mr. Heebner acknowledged that RJR hasn't shown any netincome since the 1989 buy-out because of its huge interestbill. But he said he is confident earnings will pick up asRJR reduces debt and improves food and tobacco operatingmargins.   Skeptics, such as money manager Gene Sit of Sit InvestmentAssociates, contended that RJR's stock &quot;is a little ahead ofitself.&quot;   Mr. Heebner agrees that RJR's current price reflects thefact that &quot;the market is building in expectations of goodyears ahead&quot; for a lot of consumer stocks. But Mr. Heebner iswilling to buy consumer stocks like RJR at current prices onthe belief that those companies will do well regardless ofthe economic outlook.   For RJR, the company's next step in its relentlessexcursions into the capital markets will be an offering of$750 million of senior notes. Traders said the bond offering,which was announced last month, is expected to be priced asearly as next week. Market estimates are that those bondswill yield somewhere between 10.6% and 10.8%, significantlybelow the cost of RJR's present debt.</TEXT></DOC>
