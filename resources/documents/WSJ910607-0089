The proposal assures utilities that adding new pollutionequipment or making other changes to reduce sulfur-dioxideemissions won't trigger more-stringent anti-pollutionrequirements that apply to new or modernized plants.</LP><TEXT>   Utilities had been uncertain how the EPA would handlepower-plant changes that will be necessary to halve thenation's emissions of sulfur dioxide, which is blamed foracid rain, by the year 2000. Utilities had feared thatadditional air-pollution and permit requirements could haveadded $1 billion to the $5 billion annual cost of acid-raincontrols mandated by the 1990 Clean Air Act.   The proposal assures electric utilities, the only industryrequired to combat acid rain, that they can proceed withpollution-control changes so long as the modifications are&quot;environmentally beneficial,&quot; which isn't specificallydefined. The agency is putting parts of the proposed policyinto practice immediately.   Henry Nickel, a lawyer representing the Edison ElectricInstitute and individual utilities, said the proposal removesuncertainty that had threatened to stymie utilities fromstarting work to install smokestack-scrubbing devices, orso-called clean-coal technology, or switching fuels to complywith acid-rain requirements.   But environmentalists sensed trouble. Rep. Henry Waxman(D., Calif.), a chief sponsor of last year's clean-airlegislation, argued that the proposal helps utilities at theexpense of cleaner air. He claimed it carves out loopholesthat could allow power plants to increase certain emissions.   Earlier EPA decisions and a court case involving WisconsinElectric Power Co. had raised fears that the agency wouldcount a whole range of plant changes as major modificationsthat trigger more-stringent regulations that apply to new orupdated power plants.   The EPA also proposed how it will measure the effect onair pollution caused by other kinds of changes to aging powerplants.   The agency defined a new yardstick for measuring whether aplant change results in an increase in air pollution, whichwould subject the plant to further regulation. Aging powerplants are exempt from tougher pollution controls requiredfor new plants unless they make a major change that increasespollution.   Mr. Nickel called the proposal &quot;very responsive&quot; toutilities' fears and commended EPA Administrator WilliamReilly for agreeing to reconsider a policy adopted at the endof the Reagan administration.   The EPA will accept public comment on the proposal beforemaking the rule final.</TEXT></DOC>
