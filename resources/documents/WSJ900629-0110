Except for American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. with itssteep new credit-card costs, long-distance companies areexpected to post earnings gains of 20% to 25%, matching thepace of the last few quarters. But new rate structures andcaps on regulated profit are likely to make second-quarterreports for the regional Bell telephone companies ratherdull.</LP><TEXT>   For the Baby Bells, &quot;the quarter's a yawner,&quot; said NedShadek, vice president of Putnam Cos. in Boston. Earningsgenerally are expected to be only 4% to 6% higher than in theyear-earlier period.   In many cases, the bland earnings outlook is due to newstate regulatory structures that require up-front rate cuts.Pacific Telesis Group, for example, is feeling the pinch of anew rate structure in California that took effect in January.The $391 million reduction is expected to erode earnings forat least one year at normally robust PacTel. Analysts predictthe San Francisco-based company's earnings will drop about8.9% to about 72 cents a share, compared with 79 cents ashare in the year-earlier quarter, when the company earned$325 million on revenue of $2.4 billion.   &quot;These companies are willing to take up-front earningsdilutions with the faith that they can make profits happen inthe long run,&quot; Putnam's Mr. Shadek said.   Meanwhile, Bell Atlantic Corp. and Nynex Corp. have roomto grow under newly determined regulatory ceilings forearnings, said Dan Reingold, a telecommunications analyst atMorgan Stanley andamp; Co. in New York. He anticipates BellAtlantic earnings of 90 cents a share, up about 3% from 87cents a share in the year-earlier quarter, and Nynex earningsof $1.52 a share, up about 7% from $1.42.   &quot;But I don't see any big surprises looming in the secondquarter,&quot; Mr. Reingold said.   GTE Corp. is expected to outperform most other localtelephone companies, with anticipated earnings of $1.11 ashare, up about 10% from the year-earlier period, said FrankJ. Governali, a telecommunications analyst at First BostonCorp. in New York. GTE is faring better, he said, because thecompany isn't experiencing any negative impact from adoptionof regulatory structures and has taken major cost-cuttingsteps.   Analysts foresee quarterly earnings for BellSouth Corp.growing 9% to 95 cents a share in the second quarter from 87cents a year ago. They attribute the improvement to a 3.5% to4% increase in access-line growth and 10% growth in volume(minutes of use). For Southwestern Bell Corp., which enjoyedan unusually strong quarter last year with help of a regionaleconomic resurgence, earnings are expected to drop 4.5% to 83cents a share from 87 cents.   Moreover, analysts aren't worried about excessive risk inefforts by the Bells to expand abroad. As examples of whatanalysts generally consider prudent diversification, theycited the $2.5 billion acquisition of the New Zealandtelephone system by Bell Atlantic and Ameritech, as well asthe joint venture of Bell Atlantic and U S West Inc. with thegovernment of Czechoslovakia to build a cellular telephonesystem and a public data network in that country.   &quot;Those purchases stick with the principles of phone linesand cellular. It's not like Nynex going out and buying a{retail} computer business,&quot; Mr. Shadek said. Similarly, U SWest's expansion abroad into cable television in the UnitedKingdom and Hong Kong, &quot;are transferrable skills&quot; if the BabyBells are allowed eventually to enter the U.S. cableindustry, he said.   Analyst see U S West earnings at 77 cents a share, up 8%from 71 cents in the year-earlier period.   Although the regional Bells' earnings will be&quot;uneventful,&quot; the quarter shows steady demand growth of 3% inaccess lines and 7% to 8% in call volumes, plus 50% to 60%growth in cellular communications, said Jack B. Grubman, asecurities analyst at Paine Webber Inc. in New York. He alsoconsiders revenue from customized calling features and datacommunications to be strong.   In Mr. Grubman's view, earning projections forlong-distance companies are &quot;good, but not inspiring.&quot; Costsassociated with ATandamp;T's Universal credit-card business,introduced in March, are damping earnings. On Wednesday,analysts lowered second-quarter estimates to about 58 cents ashare from earlier expectations of about 72 cents a share.ATandamp;T earned $699 million, or 65 cents a share, on revenue of$9.26 billion in the year-earlier quarter.   &quot;ATandamp;T is incurring more start-up costs, $100 million orso, than they thought they would. But what is happening withATandamp;T {the credit-card project} is outside of the overallindustry dynamics,&quot; Mr. Grubman said.   Analysts anticipate MCI Communications Corp. will postprofit of 67 cents a share, up 20% from 56 cents a share inthe year-earlier period. Mr. Grubman said he expects 20%revenue growth to about $1.9 billion compared with $1.59billion in the 1989 second quarter.   &quot;That is strong, but down from last year's 30% clip in thesecond quarter. MCI is becoming a bigger company, and it istough to keep the same growth,&quot; Mr. Grubman said.   United Telecommunications Inc., the Kansas City-basedowner of US Sprint long-distance service, is expected to postabout 20% revenue growth in the second quarter. Earnings areprojected at 53 cents a share, compared with 43 cents a sharea year earlier, when the company earned $100 million.</TEXT></DOC>
