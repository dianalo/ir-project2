One of the high-yield currencies, the Australian dollar, rose against the U.S. dollar after news of a smaller-than-expected Australian current account deficit for September. The U.S. currency fell as low as 1.2168 Australian dollars after opening in Sydney at 1.2376 Australian dollars, but recovered slightly to finish in New York around 1.2193 Australian dollars.    In late trading, the dollar stood at 1.8134 marks, up from 1.8110 marks late Tuesday, and at 127.48 yen, up slightly from 127.20 yen. Sterling rose to $1.7507 from $1.7475 late Tuesday.    In Tokyo Thursday, the U.S. currency opened at 127.46 yen, up 0.61 yen from Wednesday's close of 126.85 yen.    The U.S. dollar drew support Wednesday from reports during the Asian trading day that U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady doesn't want to see it decline further. The reports referred to a story in yesterday's edition of the Washington Post that didn't actually attribute the statements to Mr. Brady himself.    &quot;The comments served to drive the dollar a little bit higher when it was still basically a bearish market,&quot; said Keith Cheveralls, vice president and chief foreign exchange dealer with Nippon Credit Bank in New York.    The report said that Mr. Brady disagrees with both Republican and Democratic advisers calling for a depreciation of the U.S. currency, and it added that Mr. Brady is expected to express his view to the U.S. Congress later this week that the dollar should remain around current levels.    Dan Brooks, chief dealer with Westpac Banking Corp. in New York, contended that the report concerning Mr. Brady was designed to maintain the dollar's stability and prevent a second sharp movement downward.    &quot;From his (Mr. Brady's) point of view, the problem is people are afraid of a freefall in the dollar,&quot; Mr. Brooks said. Referring to earlier comments by monetary authorities emphasizing stability for the dollar, Mr. Brooks added, &quot;These are well-placed statements designed to slow the market down a little bit.&quot;    Mr. Brooks said that although the reports provided support for the dollar, the currency's failure to advance strongly indicated that longer-term capital flows from portfolio managers continue to move toward diversifying from dollar assets.    The market's bearishness on the dollar also has been tempered by a lack of follow-through from last week's sharp declines, according to Robert Hatcher, a corporate dealer with Barclays Bank in New York.    &quot;The market stalled when the Bank of Japan and the Bank of England both made it clear they weren't happy seeing their currencies appreciate further,&quot; Mr. Hatcher said. The Bank of Japan checked foreign exchange rates on Monday and the Bank of England sold sterling for dollars last Friday.    With a halt to the momentum of the dollar's fall, traders who had taken short positions on the dollar against the yen and the mark have been forced to begin covering their positions, which has given the dollar some support, Mr. Hatcher said.    He added, however, that it is premature to say the downward push on the dollar is over. If the dollar begins to approach 124 yen or 1.7800 marks, he said he expected a strong reaction from the central banks of the Group of Seven industrialized nations to support the dollar.    On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery settled at $411.40 an ounce, down 40 cents. Estimated volume was a moderate three million ounces.    In Hong Kong on Thursday, gold opened at $415.08 an ounce. </TEXT></DOC>
