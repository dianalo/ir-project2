Macy andamp; Co. Inc. over a competing offer from Campeau Corp.   But Campeau refused to give up its quest for Federated, thenation's fifth-largest retailer.   Federated and Macy signed a definitive agreement to create a newcompany, Macy's-Federated Inc., said Jim Fingeroth, a spokesman forMacy, which has nearly 100 department and specialty stores.   The agreement provides for Macy to begin a cash tender offer of$74.50 a share for about 80 percent of Federated's 89.6 millionoutstanding shares, or a total of $5.25 billion, Fingeroth said.The remaining Federated shares would be exchanged for stock in thenew company.   Campeau had offered $68 a share in cash for all Federatedshares, or $6.1 billion.   After the agreement was announced, Campeau said it would proceedwith a $66 cash tender offer for Federated.   ``Macy's bid is not competitive and we intend to prevail in themarketplace,'' a Campeau statement said. ``It is now up toFederated's shareholders to decide.''   Trading in Federated stock was halted on the New York StockExchange prior to the Federated announcement. After tradingresumed, its stock rose 50 cents per share to $67.50.   Macy's bid came to light Monday as Federated directors met toconsider whether to accept the Campeau offer.   Campeau began its bid Jan. 25, offering $47 a share. The bid wasrejected as inadequate, and Campeau sweetened the offer severaltimes before arriving at the $68 bid.   Late last week, Federated officials decided to negotiate anagreement with Campeau, and the Toronto-based developer's offer wasstill on the table as the Macy bid was considered.   Macy originally offered $73.80 per share and then increased itsbid before the agreement was signed.   Wall Street analysts said Tuesday the rival bids were attractivefor different reasons.   ``Campeau is sitting there with cash, and Macy's walked in thedoor with some cash but the opportunity for the company to enjoyfuture growth _ as opposed to Campeau's potential breaking up ordismantling of the company,'' said Thomas Tashjian, an analyst withSeidler Amdec Securities Inc. in Los Angeles.   He referred to the fact that Campeau sold off most of AlliedStores Corp.'s divisions after he bought the company in December1986.   New York-based Macy, which is privately held, is the nation's10-largest retailer.   A Federated acquisition represents for Macy's a chance tocontrol some of its major competitors, such as Bloomingdale's, andto increase its market share at the same time, said Michele Davis,of the investment firm Oppenheimer andamp; Co.   ``They can position Bloomingdale's at one price point and Macy'sat another price point such that they don't compete head on witheach other,'' she said.   The deal also would give Macy more outlets for its extensiveline of private label merchandise, said Monroe Greenstein, of theinvestment firm Bear Stearns andamp; Co. Inc.   Campeau was fighting for Federated because it does not want tolose the opportunity to gain the foothold into major U.S. shoppingcenters that Federated stores would provide, Greenstein said.   Moreover, that entree could go instead to Macy board member A.Alfred Taubman, himself a shopping mall developer, Greenstein said.   The agreement between Macy and Federated called for the newcompany's board to include significant representation from theexisting Federated board.   Macy, one of the nation's biggest and best-known retailers, wastaken private by a management group in a $3.6 billion leveragedbuyout in 1986. Its stores rang up $5.21 billion in sales duringthe fiscal year ended Aug. 1.   Federated took in $11 billion last year from its more than 650department stores, supermarkets and other outlets nationwide,including Bloomingdale's, Abraham andamp; Straus, Filene's, Burdine's,Lazarus, Bullock's and Rich's department stores; Gold Circlediscount stores and Ralphs supermarkets.   In December 1986, Campeau acquired giant Allied Stores, whoseoperations still include the Jordan Marsh, Stern's and Ann Taylorchains.</TEXT></DOC>
