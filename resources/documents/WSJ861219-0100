The charge reflects settlements of disputes over natural gas supply contracts and a write-down in value of oil service assets and oil and gas reserves, the Birmingham, Ala.-based energy concern said.    In the year-earlier fourth quarter, Sonat had a net loss of $149.8 million, including a $176 million write-down of some assets, on revenue of $708.3 million.    Separately, Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. said it downgraded the debt ratings of Sonat and some units because of the restructuring charge.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Sonat closed at $25.25 a share, down 25 cents.    Sonat said the restructuring is designed to sharpen its focus on the natural gas pipeline, oil and gas exploration and production businesses, and on two oil service units. Ronald L. Kuehn Jr., chairman, president and chief executive officer, said the move is designed to position Sonat &quot;to compete effectively and profitably in the current environment of lower oil and gas prices.&quot; The restructuring reflects a &quot;realistic assessment of the level of future activity in the depressed oil and gas industry world-wide,&quot; he added.    Analysts said Sonat took a significant step toward solving problems with its Southern Natural Gas Co. pipeline unit's take-or-pay natural gas pacts. Sonat plans an after-tax charge of about $120 million related to settling take-or-pay and pricing disputes with natural gas suppliers and to restructuring or ending those contracts.    Under a take-or-pay contract, a company agrees in advance to purchase gas whether or not the gas is needed at the time of delivery. Most of those high-cost contracts were made when natural gas was in short supply. With the decline in demand, Southern Natural has been buying less gas than it is obligated to buy under the pacts, and producers have sued.    Uncertainty about the unit's liabilities for take-or-pay contracts caused Sonat's auditors to qualify their opinion of the company's 1985 financial statements.    Including settlements recently concluded, Southern Natural has reached or expects to reach agreement with producers representing a substantial part of the unit's take-or-pay contracts, Sonat said. Sonat said it expects to make substantial additional payments to complete Southern Natural's supply-accord renegotiations, but the unit expects to recover in its gas rates a significant part of its overall costs of settling with producers.    Sonat also said it will take a $160 million nonrecurring charge to write down the asset value of its investment in the oil services business to levels more closely reflecting current market values.    In the exploration and development sector, Sonat Exploration Co. will take a write-down that will result in a charge of about $70 million and reduce the value of the unit's reserves to an amount reflecting current oil and natural gas prices.    Sonat plans to sell its tug and barge operations to management of the Sonat Marine Inc. unit and to withdraw from the underwater services business conducted by Sonat Subsea Services Inc. Also slated to be sold are 60,000 acres of Louisiana timberland. Sonat also will sell and lease back its headquarters building.    Sonat expects to close the sale of the tug and barge operations in the first half for about $200 million and expects $45 million from selling the office building and timberland. Sonat will use proceeds to cut its $1.1 billion of long-term debt.    Sonat said it also is making its contract drilling business, Sonat Offshore, more efficient. Teleco Oilfield Services Inc. is discussing either a business combination with other parties, or a consolidation, to boost the unit's revenue and strengthen its competitive position in the measurement-while-drilling sector of the oil service industry.    Sandamp;P cut Sonat's senior debt rating to triple-B-minus from triple-B and Sonat Finance Inc.'s Eurobonds, guaranteed by the parent, to triple-B-minus from triple-B.    Also, the rating concern cut Sonat's Southern Natural Gas unit's first-mortgage bonds and debentures to triple-B from single-A-minus and commercial paper rating to A-2 from A-1. The rating on tax-exempt bonds issued by Southern Natural Gas's Southern Energy Co. unit was lowered to triple-B from single-A-minus.    In the next few years, Sandamp;P said, profitability from Sonat's non-pipeline operations, which represent close to half of consolidated assets, is expected to &quot;remain weak.&quot; Consequently, &quot;debt leverage of about 60% following the restructuring is aggressive for Sonat's business mix.&quot;    Sandamp;P said Southern Natural's share of the charges will lift its leverage to about 55% from 45%. &quot;Significant potential liabilities appear to remain, and considerable uncertainty still exists with regard to the pipeline's ability to compete successfully with other gas transmission systems,&quot; the rating service said. </TEXT></DOC>
