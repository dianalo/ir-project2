A RecommendedDecision and Opportunity to File Written Exceptions published in the March24, 1988, issue of the <T4>Federal Register </T4> (53 FR 9637). A Secretary's Decision and ReferendumOrder on the Proposed Plan published in the December 20, 1988, issue ofthe <T4>Federal Register </T4> (53 FR 51110). This administrative action is governed by the provisions of sections 556and 557 of Title 5 of the U.S. Code, and therefore is excluded from therequirements of Executive Order 12291. <ITAG tagnum="84">Preliminary Statement </ITAG>This plan is issued pursuant to the applicable rules of practice and proceduregoverning proceedings to formulate and amend an order (plan) (7 CFR Part1200). This plan is effective pursuant to the provisions of the WatermelonResearch and Promotion Act, hereafter referred to as the ``Act'' (Pub.L. 99-198, 99th Congress, effective January 1, 1986, 7 U.S.C. 4901-4916).The plan was formulated on the record of a public hearing conducted inLas Vegas, Nevada, on February 18 and 19, 1987, and Atlanta, Georgia, onFebruary 24 and 25, 1987. Notice of the sessions was published in the February4, 1987, issue of the <T4>Federal Register </T4> (52 FR 3588). That notice contained a proposedplan submitted by the National Watermelon Association, Inc. Upon the basis of evidence introduced at the hearing and the record thereof,a Recommended Decision and Opportunity to File Written Exceptions was publishedin the March 24, 1988, issue of the <T4>Federal Register </T4> (53 FR 9637). Eleven exceptions were received.Three favored the proposed plan as written in the recommended decision,seven expressed opposition to certain provisions in the proposed plan,and one was not in favor of the proposed plan. Each of the eleven exceptionswas discussed and ruled upon in the Secretary's Decision. The Secretary's Decision was issued December 20, 1988, directing that areferendum be conducted for the Watermelon Research and Promotion Planin accordance with the procedure for the conduct of referenda (7 CFR Part1210.200) as published in the December 20, 1988, issue of the <T4>Federal Register </T4> (53 FR 51089), to determine whether the issuanceof the proposed plan was approved or favored by producers and handlers,as defined in the plan, who during the representative period were engagedin the production or first handling of watermelons within the contiguous48 States. The representative period was determined to be the calendaryear January 1, 1988, through December 31, 1988. The referendum ballotprovided only for the approval or disapproval of the plan. In the referendum,a majority of producers (52 percent) and a majority of handlers (56 percent)voted in favor of the proposed plan. Those in favor of the plan accountedfor 73 percent of the volume voted in the referendum. Thus, the plan meetsstatutory criteria for industry approval.The plan authorizes, with the approval of the Secretary, the collectionof equal assessments on producers and handlers of watermelons. Handlerswill be responsible for collecting and submitting assessments and for maintainingappropriate records. Refunds of collected assessments can be obtained byproducers and handlers who do not support the plan. Assessment funds willbe used to promote watermelons through a variety of market research andproduct promotion programs. These programs will be developed and administeredby a national-level, Watermelon Promotion Board (Board) composed of 14producer members, 14 handler members, and a public member. Daily administrationof the plan will be carried out by a staff directly responsible to theBoard. All administrative rules and regulations, as well as research andpromotion programs developed by the Board, must be submitted to the Secretaryof Agriculture for approval. Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.),the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has determinedthat this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities as defined by the RFA. The purpose of the RFAis to fit regulatory action to the scale of business subject to such action,in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionatelyburdened. Research and promotion programs, and their rules and regulations,are unique in that they are normally brought about through group actionof essentially small entities acting for their own benefit. As stated in the notice of hearing, interested persons were invited topresent evidence at the hearing on the probable impact of the regulatoryand informational requirements of the proposed plan on small businessesfor the purposes of RFA. In that regard, such evidence was considered inarriving at the findings and conclusions contained in the recommended decisionand the Secretary's decision. Those findings and conclusions are incorporatedherein. The record indicates that most handlers regulated under this program wouldmeet the Small Business Administration's (SBA) definition of small agriculturalservice firms (13 CFR 121.2). Small agricultural service firms are definedas those having annual gross receipts for the last three years of lessthan $3,500,000. There may be as many as 300 such handlers of watermelonswho will be subject to regulation under this plan. Small agricultural producersare defined by the SBA as having revenues for the last three years of lessthan $500,000. Hearing evidence indicates that watermelons are producedon almost 12,000 farms in the United States. A vast majority of these farmswould meet the SBA definition of small agricultural producers. Many farmsproduce less than five acres of watermelons, and thus will not be affectedby the plan. The industry also includes a few large farms in excess of400 acres. Record evidence shows the majority of watermelons are produced for freshmarket sales. Proponents of the plan testified that the watermelon industryis in serious trouble because of an apparent decrease in demand for watermelons.Record exhibits indicate a significant and steady decline in per capitaconsumption of watermelons between 1960 and 1981. Consumption fell 30 percent,from 17.2 pounds to 12.3 pounds per capita, during this period. No testimonywas provided that would explain the decline in per capita consumption.However, the record indicates that under the plan, the issue would be studied,possible causes identified and corrective programs initiated. While consumption declined during the 1960's and 1970's, total value ofthe crop increased by 400 percent. Most of this increase in value reflectedinflationary changes rather than rises in real dollar income. In constantdollars the crop value increased only 15 percent in the 21 year period.Comparable values of vegetables and melons, fresh fruit market prices,and the consumer price index for all foods increased over 300 percent duringthe same period. The plan will assess both producers and handlers at equal rates, not toexceed two cents per hundredweight on watermelons produced and two centsper hundredweight on watermelons handled. Testimony at the hearing indicatesa unanimous agreement by those testifying that this amount will be relativelyinsignificant and will not impose a financial burden on large or smallproducers and handlers. The two cents per hundredweight assessment raterepresents less than one percent of producer income and less than one percentof handler income based on a seasonal average selling price of $6 per hundredweight.The benefits of the program are expected to exceed the costs. Producersand handlers who do not agree with the program may request a refund ofassessments paid. While the plan imposes certain recordkeeping and reporting requirementson handlers, information required to be reported under the plan can becompiled from records currently maintained by handlers. Such recordkeepingand reporting requirements are minimal and should not impose an undue burdenon handlers. In addition, the plan provides for referenda to determineif watermelon producers and handlers favor termination or suspension ofthe plan or any provisions thereof. In compliance with the Office of Managementand Budget (OMB) regulations (5 CFR Part 1320) which implement the PaperworkReduction Act (PRA) of 1980 (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35) and section 3504(h)of the PRA, the information collection and recordkeeping requirements containedin the plan were submitted to the OMB for approval. The OMB approved theinformation collection provisions of the plan under OMB number 0581-0158.Based on comparable research and promotion programs, it has been estimatedthat it takes an average of 15 minutes to complete required forms. Approximately300 handlers could be affected by the reporting and recordkeeping requirementsof the plan. We have reviewed this action in view of the executive order on Federalism,Executive Order 12612 (52 FR 41686) and determined that the plan does nothave sufficient Federalism implications to warrant the preparation of aFederalism assessment. This action is consistent with the principles andprovisions of Executive Order 12612. Implementation of this national plandoes not foreclose appropriate State Programs for watermelons. <ITAG tagnum="84">Findings, Conclusions, and Rulings on Exceptions </ITAG>The material issues, findings and conclusions, and rulings on exceptionscontained in the Recommended Decision and the Secretary's Decision publishedin the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on March 24, 1988 (53 FR 9637) and December 20,1988 (53 FR 51110) respectively, are incorporated by reference in thisdocument and are hereby ratified and affirmed.<ITAG tagnum="84">General Findings </ITAG>Upon the basis of the evidence introduced at the hearing, and the recordthereof, it is found that: (1) The plan, and all of its terms and conditions thereof, as hereinafterset forth, will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act; (2) The plan regulates the handling of watermelons in the contiguous 48States in the same manner as, and is applicable only to persons in therespective classes of commercial or industrial activity specified in, aproposed plan upon which a hearing has been held; (3) The handling of watermelons in the contiguous 48 States, as definedin the plan, is in the current of interstate or foreign commerce or directlyburdens, obstructs, or affects such commerce. (4) The plan is applicable only to persons involved in the production ofand first handling of watermelons, as specified in the Act. <ITAG tagnum="84">Additional Findings </ITAG>It is necessary and in the public interest to make this plan effectiveupon publication in the<T4> Federal Register </T4>so that the Board, the administrative agencyprovided for in the plan, may be nominated, selected, and may start tofunction as soon as possible. The start of the 1990 marketing year is January1, 1990. Before the program can begin, it will be necessary for the Boardto recommend regulations for the Secretary's approval and publication inthe<T4> Federal Register.</T4> In addition, the Board will have to draft bylawsfor approval by the Secretary. It will also be necessary for the Boardto recommend a budget of anticipated expenses to the Secretary for approval.Further, it will be necessary for the Board to hire a staff to carry outits necessary administrative functions. Therefore, it appears that no usefulpurpose would be served by postponing the effective date of this plan for30 days beyond the date of its publication in the<T4> Federal Register. </T4>In view of the foregoing it is hereby found and determined that good causeexists for not postponing the effective date of this plan until 30 daysafter publication in the<T4> Federal Register </T4>(5 U.S.C. 553(d), Administrative Procedure Act).<ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusions </ITAG>It is hereby determined that: (1) The issuance of the plan is favored orapproved by producers and handlers who participated in a referendum onthe question of its approval and who, during the period January 1, 1988,through December 31, 1988 (which was deemed to be a representative periodfor the purposes of the referendum), were engaged in the production offive or more acres and/or first handling of watermelons within the forty-eightcontiguous States of the United States; and (2) The issuance of this planis the appropriate means for carrying out the declared policy of the Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR 1210 </ITAG>Watermelons, Agricultural research, Agricultural promotion, Market development.<ITAG tagnum="84">Order Relative to Production and Handling of Watermelons </ITAG><T3>It is hereby ordered, </T3>That, on January 1, 1990, the collectionof assessments and the handling of watermelons shall be in conformity toand in compliance with the following terms and conditions: <ITAG tagnum="84">Final Plan </ITAG>The following plan shall be the detailed means by which the foregoing conclusionsmay be carried out.
