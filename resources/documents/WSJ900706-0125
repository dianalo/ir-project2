French controllers in the air-traffic center that handlesthe Paris region ended a three-day walkout. Air France had tocancel 60% of its short-range and medium-range flights, anddomestic carrier Air Inter canceled two out of three of itsscheduled flights. Foreign airlines flying to Paris alsotrimmed or canceled their schedules. Yesterday, Air France'sground personnel announced a 36-hour strike beginning today.</LP><TEXT>   Last week, Belgian controllers halted all airlineoperations at Brussels Airport for a day until they won a 24%pay increase over two years. Rome controllers threatened awork stoppage before the World Cup soccer match began inJune, but then backed off after a plea from the transportminister. Swedish controllers staged work-to-rule actions inMay, causing chaotic delays at Stockholm airport andthroughout the country.   No one, not even the International Federation of AirTraffic Controllers Associations, knows where the nextEuropean strike will occur. &quot;I don't think any air-trafficcontrol organization plans on having an industrial dispute,&quot;says Preben Falkman-Lauridsen, a Danish controller who isIFATCA's executive vice president for Europe. &quot;But whennegotiations with the administration go poorly, that's whenthere's a strike.&quot;   Strikes cost travelers untold delays and reroutings.Sabena, Belgian's flag carrier, tried to operate some of itslong-haul flights out of Luxembourg and Duesseldorf duringthe one-day strike at Brussels last week. Incoming trafficwas rerouted to Amsterdam and Luxembourg. But that meantthree-hour rail or bus journeys for passengers whose flightsdid operate.   Such actions also cost airlines millions of dollars.Sabena says it doesn't have a price tag yet for last week'saction. But the annual reports of many European airlinescontain evidence of the costliness of a controllers' strike,or indeed, any action by pilots, mechanics, flight attendantsor others that slows or halts flight operations -- even inanother country.   Unfortunately, such industrial actions appear endemic inEurope. Certainly, those on the receiving end seem to beresigned. &quot;It's the usual summer obstructions,&quot; one airportofficial says of the recent disturbances.   &quot;It's the normal amount,&quot; says a spokesman forEurocontrol, a Pan-European air-traffic planning agency.&quot;It's not that bad compared with last year.&quot;   Adds Marcel Pisters, deputy secretary-general of theAssociation of European Airlines: &quot;These are sporadic things.It's a reflection of the overall air-traffic control setup inEurope.&quot; Controllers, he adds, &quot;are civil servants. And in anumber of countries, their financial conditions aren't thebest you can think of.&quot;   The French stoppage affected the country's main northernair-traffic center at Athis-Mons. Controllers are asking payand staff increases to cope with what they say is a mountingworkload caused by the boom in air travel. Strikers aredemanding bonuses of 3,000 French francs ($540) to FFr5,000 amonth to supplement their current average monthly salary ofFFr16,000.   But the complaints aren't always about money. &quot;Thesedisputes seem to flare up very quickly,&quot; says a spokesman forthe International Transport Workers Federation, over issuessuch as manning levels, shifts, overtime work, reducedholiday periods and poor equipment. And their grievances &quot;arepretty well justified,&quot; says one labor specialist.   The roots of the problem can be traced back to the early1980s. Then, Europe plunged into recession, air-traffic felland governments quit recruiting controllers and took moneyearmarked for air-traffic equipment and put it into roads,hospitals, schools and other worthy state projects.   So when economies improved and air travel unexpectedlyboomed in the mid-1980s, governments were doublyill-prepared. By some estimates, Europe needs 1,500 to 2,000more qualified controllers than it has today, mostly due todouble-digit traffic increases in the past few years. Butwith the moderate-to-low salaries offered, it isn't easy torecruit controllers. And it takes several years to trainthem.   Meanwhile, experts say, Europe's air-traffic system ishopelessly inefficient. Western Europe has 22 nationalsystems running 42 air-traffic control centers. The centershandle half the traffic 20 U.S. centers handle -- for twicethe price. Little effort is being made to standardizepurchasing of equipment, and the necessary technical upgradesare slow in coming.   This problem has gotten more attention in the past coupleof years of massive summertime air congestion and frequentair-traffic control strikes. Governments are beginning tobudget more money for the field and are for the first timetalking to their neighbors about integrating their controlsystems. But billions of dollars, lots of political will andyears are called for, especially as air traffic continues tosurge.   Thus, the short-term outlook isn't bright. &quot;You can makecontrollers work a lot of overtime and lengthen their workinghours,&quot; says Mr. Falkman-Lauridsen of IFATCA, &quot;or they canhandle reduced traffic.&quot; In other words, the choice isbetween strikes and delays.</TEXT></DOC>
