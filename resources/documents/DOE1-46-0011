<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-46-0011 </DOCNO><TEXT>A series of well-defined benchmark tests are being carried out on theBoiler Dynamics Rig (BDR) at MEL. These tests form part of the on-goingtask to provide Quality Assurance for the NUMEL code, the United Kingdom(UK) reference monotube dynamic boiler model. To facilitate the handlingof fluctuations in the experimentally measured boundary conditions, asinput data, and to account for all the program requirements, the BDRCOMPprogram was developed. This report describes the BDRCOMP code and theoptions available for processing rig measurements and presenting thecomparisons of model and rig results. The report is one of a series thatconstitute the Quality Assurance Document: NUMEL Validation Against BenchmarkTests on the Boiler Dynamics Rig. It relates specifically to Part 1 (BoilerDynamics Rig Description and Methodology), where the NUMEL comparisonsare introduced, and Part 2 (Single Channel Transients), where full detailsof the first series of benchmark tests are given. Other QA documentsshould be consulted for information on the rig instrumentation, the actualtests performed and any further details.</TEXT></DOC>
