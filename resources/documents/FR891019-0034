In addition, Gateway requests, pursuant to andSection;157.103(f)(1) of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, pregrantedauthority to abandon any facilities or services authorized under this certificateapplication that Gateway determines are no longer needed upon the terminationof its contractual obligations underlying the service.The purpose of the Gateway Pipeline Project is to transport natural gasproduced in the Mobile Bay Area from gas treatment plants to United's interstatepipeline system, and to provide open-access transportation service forall potential shippers of Mobile Bay Area gas. The estimated cost of theGateway Pipeline Project is $20,413,000.By this notice, the FERC staff is requesting comments on the scope of theanalysis that should be conducted for the EA. All comments will be reviewedprior to publication of the EA and significant issues will be addressed.Comments should focus on potential environmental effects, alternativesto the proposal (including alternate routes), and measures to mitigateadverse environmental impact. Written comments must be submitted by November20, 1989 in accordance with the instructions provided at the end of thisnotice.<ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Action</ITAG>On December 22, 1988, Gateway filed an application with the FERC in DocketNo. CP89-471-000 to construct, own and operate approximately 25.75 milesof pipeline and appurtenant facilities. No compression, storage, or processfacilities are included in this project. The pipeline would connect theMobil Oil Exploration and Producing Southeast, Inc. (MOEPSI) gas treatmentplant in Mobile County, Alabama, the proposed gas treatment plants of ExxonCorporation and Jubilee Pipeline Company, and any other appropriate futuregas treatment plants, with United's Lirette-Mobile pipeline at a pointjust east of the Mississippi border in Mobile County, Alabama.<ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Facilities</ITAG>The general location of the proposed Gateway pipeline is shown in figure1.\1\<NOTE/> The proposed facilities include approximately 24.5 milesof 30-inch-diameter pipeline; a 1.0-mile-long 30-inch-diameter lateral;a 0.25-mile-long 20-inch-diameter lateral; associated appurtenances (checkvalves, blow off stacks, mainline valves, pressure differential detectors);gas metering facilities; and roads into the gas metering facilities. Theproposed pipeline would extend from Section 34, T7S, R2W, Mobile County,Alabama at the MOEPSI gas treatment plant to Section 4, T5S, R4W, MobileCounty, Alabama, where it would connect with United's existing Lirette-Mobile30-inch-diameter pipeline. The proposed pipeline would also connect tothe proposed Exxon plant located in Section 16, T7S, R2W, Mobile County,and other proposed plants which might be located in the vicinity. The exactconnection points to these plants are not shown on figure 1 as their exactlocations are presently unknown. Applications to construct these interconnectionswould be required in the future. The metering facilities would be locatedat the tailgates of the existing and proposed gas treatment plants andat the interconnection with United's Lirette-Mobile pipeline. The designcapacity of the proposed pipeline is 600,000 Mcf (thousand cubic feet)of gas per day.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Figure 1 is not being printed in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, but copies are available from the Commission'sPublic Reference Branch at (202) 357-8118. A copy of figure 1 is attachedto each mailed copy of the notice.Construction-zone requirements include a 70-foot-wide construction right-of-wayand 125-foot-square staging areas on each side of stream, highway, pipeline,and railroad crossings. Approximately 218.48 acres would be temporarilydisturbed by construction along the 25.75 miles of proposed pipeline.The permanent right-of-way would be reduced from the 70-foot-width neededfor construction to 50 feet. Approximately 156.1 acres would be maintainedas a permanent right-of-way. In addition, a total of approximately 4.0acres would be needed for the four gas metering facilities, and approximately0.7 acre of permanent 20-foot-wide road would be required for each of thefour metering facilities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Construction Procedures</ITAG>Gateway states that the proposed facilities would be constructed and operatedin accordance with all applicable regulations. These include: 49 CFR part192_Transportation of Natural and Other Gas by Pipeline: Minimum FederalSafety Standards; 18 CFR Part 2.69_Guidelines to be Followed by NaturalGas Pipeline Companies in the Planning, Clearing, and Maintenance of Rights-of-Way;and other applicable Federal, state, and local regulations and permit requirements.If authorized, construction is expected to require 3.5 to 4.5 months tocomplete. Gateway expects these facilities to be in service by July 1991.A workforce of approximately 200 to 300 persons would be required, dependingon scheduling, weather conditions and unforeseen problems.Gateway would acquire right-of-way easements for the proposed pipeline,but has no plans to acquire any lands in fee for the project. All landsinvolved in the proposed project would remain in private ownership, andGateway would compensate the landowners for properties used by the proposedproject.Approximately 83.5 acres of timbered land would be cleared during construction.Trees removed from the right-of-way would be disposed of in accordancewith Federal, state and local regulations. It is anticipated that all merchantabletimber would be harvested. Brush and other timber would be piled and burnedor removed in conformance with applicable regulations.Conventional methods would be used for the pipeline construction. A 70-foot-wideconstruction right-of-way would be surveyed, cleared and graded as necessaryto move construction equipment in and out. The pipeline trench would thenbe excavated to a depth of approximately 66 inches to allow for a minimumof 3 feet of cover after construction. The bottom width of the trench wouldbe sufficient to allow for the emplacement of the pipeline and its appurtenances,including concrete weights or coatings if necessary to hold the pipelinein place. The top width of the trench would vary with soil conditions andslope stability. Materials removed during the trenching operation wouldbe temporarily placed next to the trench until the pipeline was installed.There are no plans to use containment structures around the stockpiledexcavated materials due to the temporary nature of the stockpiles. Duringbackfill operations, the preconstruction contours and elevations wouldbe restored along the pipeline route. Slopes would be stabilized by oneor more of the following methods: seeding, sodding, terracing, riprappingor bulkheading.The pipeline trench would be excavated by a crawler-mounted wheel-typetrenching machine, back-hoe or similar equipment. All highway and surfacedroad crossings would be dry bored in accordance with applicable regulations.Unsurfaced roads may be trenched after appropriate notice to users andin accordance with existing regulations.As proposed, stream crossings would generally be accomplished through opentrench excavation with equipment operating from the banks. Typically, draglineswould be used to excavate the bank cuts and the trench across the stream.Wetland crossings are proposed to be accomplished using marsh excavatingequipment or land excavating equipment. The pipeline would be welded, coated,and inspected, floatation devices would be installed as required, and thepipe ``pushed'' across the wetland area. Weights would be attached to thepipe as needed to prevent any floatation after installation.Cultivated farmland crossings would be accomplished by conventional constructionmethods, except that double ditching would be used unless prohibited bythe landowner. In the double ditching method, topsoils and subsoils arestockpiled separately, and after the pipeline is in place, the subsoilsare backfilled first, followed by the topsoil. The right-of-way would berestored to its original contour as much as practicable and revegetatedin accordance with an erosion control and revegetation plan that will bereviewed by the FERC staff.As a part of the construction procedures and as required by the U.S. Departmentof Transportation, the pipeline would be hydrostatically tested. Approximately4,754,981 gallons of water would be required for the tests. Withdrawalrates, if local sources are used, would be 2,000 to 4,000 gallons per minute.After testing, the water would either be returned to its original sourceat approximately the same rate at which it was withdrawn, or dischargedat an equivalent rate to follow natural contours, or trucked off site.Neither an oxygen scavenger nor a biocide would be used, so test waterwould not be treated prior to discharge, except to filter mill rust ifnecessary.<ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Issues</ITAG>Based on preliminary analyses of the application for new facilities andthe environmental information provided by the applicant, the FERC staffhas identified a number of issues which will be addressed in the EA. Theseissues include:<ITAG tagnum="16">Topography and Soils</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">_Erosion control.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">_Impact on crop production and farmland.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">Geology and Hydrology</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">_Impact on streams.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">_Impact on existing water flow patterns.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">_Impact on water table.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">_Effects of construction on potable water supplies.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">_Effects of construction on water quality.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">Wetlands and Vegetation</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">_Effects of construction on wetlands.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">_Revegetation and right-of-way management.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">_Loss of endangered plant species.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">Fish and Wildlife</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">_Impact on fisheries.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">_Impact on threatened and endangered species.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">Land Use, Socioeconomics, and Aesthetics</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">_Impact on homes.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">_Impact on recreation, public lands, natural areas.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">_Appearance of right-of-way.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">_Conflicts with existing or potential land uses.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">Cultural Resources</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">_Effect on properties listed on or eligible for inclusion on the NationalRegister of Historic Places.</ITAG>Comments are solicited on any additional topics of environmental concernto residents and others in the project area. After comments in responseto this notice are received and analyzed and the various issues investigated,the staff will publish an EA for the Gateway Pipeline Project.<ITAG tagnum="84">Description of Alternative Routes</ITAG>The FERC staff has currently identified two possible alternate routes tothe proposed Gateway Pipeline Project. One route would utilize an existingelectrical transmission line right-of-way east of the proposed route, extendingfrom the vicinity of the MOEPSI gas treatment plant northward to the intersectionwith United's existing Lirette-Mobile pipeline approximately 6 miles eastof the proposed interconnection. The other route would utilize TranscontinentalGas Pipe Line Corporation's (Transco) existing 30-inch-diameter pipelineright-of-way generally west of the proposed route, extending from the vicinityof the MOEPSI gas treatment plant northwest to the intersection with United'sexisting Lirette-Mobile pipeline approximately 2 miles east of the proposedinterconnection.The general location of the alternate routes mentioned above is shown infigure 1.<ITAG tagnum="84">Comment Procedure</ITAG>A copy of this notice and request for comments on environmental issueshas been sent to Federal, state, and local environmental agencies, partiesin this proceeding, public interest groups, libraries, newspapers and otherinterested individuals. The governments of Mobile Country and all townswhich are traversed by the proposed pipeline will be provided copies ofdetailed maps which identify the location of the proposed project.Comments on the scope of the EA should be filed as soon as possible butno later than November 20, 1989. All written comments must reference DocketNo. CP89-471-000 and be addressed to the Secretary, Federal Energy RegulatoryCommission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, DC 20426. A copyof the comments should also be sent to Mr. Phil Veres, Project Manager,Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Room 7312, 825 North Capitol Street,N.E., Washington, DC 20426. Comments recommending that the FERC staff addressspecific environmental issues should be supported with a detailed explanationof the need to consider such issues.The EA will be based on the FERC staff's independent analysis of the proposaland, together with the comments received, will comprise part of the recordto be considered by the Commission in this proceeding. The EA will be sentto all parties in this proceeding, to those providing comments in responseto this notice, to Federal and state agencies, and to interested membersof the public. The EA may be offered as evidentiary material if an evidentiaryhearing is held in this proceeding. In the event that an evidentiary hearingis held, anyone not previously a part to this proceeding and wishing topresent evidence on environmental or other matters must first file withthe Commission a motion to intervene, pursuant to Rule 214 of the Commission'sRules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214).Additional information about the proposal, including detailed route mapsfor specific locations, is available from Mr. Phil Veres, Project Manager,telephone (202) 357-8073.<ITAG tagnum="6">Lois D.
