It is necessary therefore to assess the tumor staging of renalcell carcinoma preoperatively. The present study was undertaken to comparethe results of preoperative clinical staging by angiography, CT, US andlymphangiography with the pathological findings in 95 patients who underwentnephrectomy or autopsy. We then attempted to establish ideal criteriafor synthetic image diagnosis based on angiography, CT US and lymphographyin terms of tumor staging, lymph node metastasis and venous involvement.The accuracy of the T stage was as follows: 76 cases out of 94 (81 %)were correctly diagnosed by angiography, 64 of 75 (85 %) by CT, and 43of 48 (90 %) by US. The accuracy of the N stage was 87 % by CT and 70% by lymphography. The V stage was correctly diagnosed in 85 %, 87 %and 73 % by CT, US and angiography, respectively. Based on the characteristicsof such imaging diagnosis in relation to the pathological findings, weestablished the following criteria of synthetic diagnosis. For the Tstage, 1) if 2 or 3 among the 3 images show the same results, the stageis determined, and 2) if all of them are different, the stage of US,CT and angiography is determined in order. As regards the N stage, thestage is determined only from the CT findings. If a reliable positiveimage is obtained for the V stage from all the diagnostic methods, thehighest stage is determined. Employing the above criteria, we obtainedhigh accuracies of 94 % for the T stage and 87 % for the V stage. Theabove results show the most accurate preoperative staging so far possiblewith the presently available image diagnosis techniques.</TEXT></DOC>
