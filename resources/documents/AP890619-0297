The deal must be weighed by both state and federal regulators,who are considering several proposals for new natural gas pipelinesinto California.   The agreement is between pipeline builders Kern River GasTransmission Co. and Mojave Pipeline Co. and includes SouthernCalifornia Gas Co., the big utility.   It calls for each pipeline company to build its own line to theCalifornia desert city of Barstow, where the lines would merge andcontinue to the oilfields of Kern County. There, the gas would beburned to produce steam that is used to extract thick, tar-like oilfrom the ground under the southern San Joaquin Valley.   Kern River, a joint venture of Tenneco Inc. of Houston andWilliams Cos. of Tulsa, Okla., would bring natural gas from Opal,Wyo. Mojave, owned by Houston-based Enron Corp. and El Paso NaturalGas Co., a subsidiary of Burlington Resources, would bring gas fromTopock, Ariz.   Any such pipeline into the state must be approved by the FederalEnergy Regulatory Commission, which has approved one similarapplication and is considering another by the state's other big gasutility, Pacific Gas andamp; Electric Co.   Another competitor, the Wyoming-California Pipeline Co., has wonFERC approval for a line from Wyoming. That company, a subsidiary ofCoastal Corp. of Houston, hopes to break ground next year, buthasn't signed enough customers to commit to construction, saidspokesman Jim Bailey.   At least three other pipeline proposals have been floated _ twoinvolving gas from Canada and one from Mexico _ but those aren'tactively before regulators.</TEXT></DOC>
