(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Doo Dah Parade, an irreverent spoofof the esteemed Tournament of Roses on New Year's Day, lured about75,000 spectators curbside for 90 minutes of belly laughs onSunday.   Characters representing Zsa Zsa Gabor, Roseanne Barr, MilliVanilli, Bart Simpson and even Saddam Hussein strutted their stuff- or got roasted - in ``the 15th occasional'' running of theThanksgiving weekend event.   A well-behaved crowd gathered in 72-degree temperatures towitness the mile-long procession, said police Sgt. Kevin Hall.   The Doo Dah was the first of three Los Angeles-area paradesSunday.   More than 150,000 people cheered as actors Edward James Olmosand Catherine Bach led off the 16th Annual East Los AngelesChristmas Parade. About 750,000 people lined the streets at 6 p.m.to view the start of the Hollywood Christmas Parade, featuringArnold Schwarzenegger as grand marshal.   ``I'm so excited, I tell you it's absolutely wonderful,''Schwarzenegger said when the parade began. ``I'm full of energy,ready to go to pump up the Christmas spirit.''   The muscleman sat atop a float bedecked with child co-stars fromhis new movie, ``Kindergarten Cop.''   Unlike the stately Rose Parade, the Doo Dah Parade has no theme,no prize, and no judge.   But like the parade it lampoons, it had a queen. This year'smonarch was waitress Lila Johnson, who was crowned after winning anarm wrestling contest.   The pop music duo Milli Vanilli was lampooned by many entrants,including the Do It Yourself Milli Vanilli Band lip-syncing ``Girl,You Know It's True.''   Last week, the pair returned their best new artist Grammy Awardafter it was revealed they never sang a note on their hit record.   Roseanne Barr also was targeted. The world's largest shoppingcart was pushed down the street on a mission to fill the rotundcomedian's grocery list.   Boos greeted the Roseanne Barr National Anthem Drill team, whichscreeched out the actress' infamous rendition of the``Star-Spangled Banner'' while a group in San Diego Padres uniformsplugged their ears.   Television was made fun of, too, as the group Thursday NightFight put Bart Simpson and Bill Cosby lookalikes in a boxing ring.The Thursday evening shows have been battling it out in a ratingswar.   Old favorites also were on hand. The synchronized briefcasedrill team frowned, businesslike, through their maneuvers; themobile volleyball team kept the ball in the air as the net moveddown the street; and the marching hibachi grill team flungtortillas to the crowd.   The real bankers, attorneys and investment advisors in thebriefcase team were themselves spoofed by the Bozo SynchronizedBriefcase Drill Team in clown makeup and pinstriped suits.   The Slap My Face and Call Me Saddam Drill Team offered asolution for the world's most pressing problem. Under a bannerreading, ``Zsa Zsa - America's Secret Weapon,'' a group of Zsa Zsasslapped Saddam Hussein posers and wrested globes from the mockstrongmen.   Some themes were directed at a Californian audience.   Architects wearing houses fell prey to imaginary earthquakes,mudslides and brush fires.   Medflies danced around marching fruit, flowers and helicopters.They sang about the pesticide Malathion, which state agriculturalofficials sprayed over Southern California neighborhoods this yearin the latest war against the Mediterranean fruit fly.</TEXT></DOC>
