But they also said it isn't likely that the sale is goingto take place anytime soon.</LP><TEXT>   The company has been trying to sell its majority stake inthe loss-making 19-hotel Penta group for several months, thepeople close to the company said. They confirmed a report inthis week's Wirtschaftswoche, a weekly business newsmagazine, that the Steigenberger group, a German hotel andhotel management company, is one of the parties interested inbuying Penta.   The Penta group's problems center mostly on two hotels inOrlando, Fla., and Atlanta, but the people close to Lufthansasaid the airline, in a policy shift, is considering changingat least part of its involvement in the hotel business fromoutright shareholdings to less risky partnership contracts.   Lufthansa also holds a 43% stake in the German Kempinskihotel group, but the people close to the company said it hasno plans to divest itself of that stake.   Separately, Lufthansa said it plans a far-reaching programof cost reduction that includes freezing world-wide personneltotals at end-1991 levels. Lufthansa employs about 50,000people world-wide.   The job freeze would mean that the 52% state-owned Germanflag carrier is canceling previous plans to boost its globalwork force by 5,000 people in 1992, Lufthansa said.   The company also said it plans to &quot;limit&quot; other operatingcosts, especially those for materials.   A Lufthansa spokesman said the carrier also plans to slowits previously planned expansion of fleet capacity. As aresult, the company will idle four more of its aircraft,added to the 14 planes it plans to mothball indefinitely atairports around the world.   Lufthansa nonetheless, will take delivery this year of 20new planes, variously built by Boeing Co. of the U.S. andAirbus Industrie, the European aircraft consortium.   There hasn't yet been any indication, however, if the 37or so aircraft originally on order for future deliverybeginning in 1993 -- mainly Airbuses -- will be affected.</TEXT></DOC>
