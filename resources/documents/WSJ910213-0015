In all, Boeing, McDonnell Douglas Corp. and AirbusIndustrie -- the Big Three of commercial aerospace -- weregearing up to deliver 788 jetliners this year. Suddenly, withthe global economy in recession and many of the world's aircarriers finding themselves woefully short of cash, it seemsdoubtful those plans will be fulfilled.</LP><TEXT>   News of the Australian carrier's decision came late in aday in which British Airways for a time was thought to havepostponed receipt of five Boeing 767s as part of a massivecost-cutting move. Later, after Boeing's share price hadalready plunged on the New York Stock Exchange, it waslearned that British Airways would in fact accept the jetslater this year as scheduled, but wouldn't introduce theminto service right away.   Before Boeing could breathe a sigh of relief, Qantas saidits directors met last week and decided to hold up thedelivery of some airliners.   Boeing finished the day on the Big Board at $48.25, down$3.125.   Qantas had been planning to add seven 747s and four 767sto its fleet by July 1992. Now, new dates and paymentschedules will be negotiated. A spokesman for Qantasemphasized that &quot;this is not a cancellation at this stage&quot;and added that one 747-400 wide-body jet due to arrive fromBoeing this month will still come on time.   But clearly, the market has softened. McDonnell Douglasdisclosed in its third-quarter financial statement that morethan 100 options for twin-jets weren't picked up by AMRCorp.'s American Airlines unit and other customers.   Last week, Air France said it was pushing back sevenAirbus A-340 deliveries to 1995 from 1994, and it alsocanceled four A-310 options. McDonnell Douglas also said lastweek that Taiwan's Great China Airlines ordered three MD-90jets, scaling back its original commitment for six planes.Also within the past month, a company spokesman disclosedyesterday, an unidentified leasing concern canceled a firmorder for &quot;a significant number of airplanes&quot; that were dueto be delivered in 1995 and beyond.   &quot;We're watching the airline industry literally comingapart at the seams,&quot; said Scott Hamilton, editor of theCommerical Aviation Report, a biweekly financial publicationbased in Dallas. &quot;It's obviously going to filter back to themanufacturers.&quot;   Boeing executives played down the Qantas action, sayingthat they expect a rebound before long, especially becausesome 2,000, 20-year-old jetliners currently are in use thatpresumably will have to be replaced soon. &quot;While we recognizethe severity of problems for some airlines in the near term,&quot;the company said in a statement yesterday, &quot;the long-termoutlook for air travel appears bright.&quot;   &quot;We believe the Gulf war is creating a pent-up demandthat, when released, will more than restore commercial airtraffic to its former levels.&quot;   Indeed, Boeing Chairman Frank Shrontz told reporters lastmonth that more orders will soon be announced for thecompany's new wide-body jetliner, the 777, and that Chinawill shortly pick an American partner in an ambitiousaircraft coproduction project. These, he said, are indicatorsthat &quot;demand for jet transports remains very strong&quot; despite&quot;periodic economic downturns.&quot;   To date, Boeing has orders for 1,824 planes valued at $105billion. Airbus's backlog at the end of 1990 was 1,038aircraft valued at $71.5 billion. At the end of last year,McDonnell Douglas had firm orders for 552 aircraft -- 378MD-80s and 174 MD-11s -- with an estimated value of more than$28 billion, plus options and other commitments on another669 aircraft.   But others believe the deferral of the Qantas planes,coupled with the other moves across the industry in recentweeks, is a sure sign that fundamentals are eroding. And theyquestion how long Boeing will stick to its plans to expandproduction of its 737 two-engine jets to 21 a month from 17.The demand for narrow-body planes has been particularly weaklately.   &quot;There's going to be an awful lot of airlines approachingBoeing in the next few months saying: `Can we defer our firmorders?'&quot; predicted Richard Hannah of UBS Phillips andamp; DrewLtd. in London. With 65% to 70% of a jet's price typicallypaid for at the time of delivery, such moves will cutstraight into the plane maker's profit levels.   With that in mind, Michael Rosen, aerospace analyst forSmith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co., yesterday lowered hisrating on Boeing stock to &quot;avoid&quot; from &quot;hold.&quot; He said herecognized that a lot of the turmoil in the aviation industryis a direct result of the Gulf war, which has made jet fuelprices volatile and sharply curtailed passenger trafficbecause of fears of terrorism.   But, he added, &quot;A lot of what we're seeing is part of amuch larger problem. Even when the war ends, I think capacitywill outstrip demand. Things are going to get worse beforethey get better.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
