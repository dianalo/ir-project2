Five times the Iranian missiles missed their target, athree ship attack group from the U.S. Navy.   The U.S.-Iranian feud exploded into missile warfare Monday asthe United States attacked two Iranian platforms in retaliation fora mine that blew a hole in a U.S. frigate last week in the PersianGulf.   During the day, the ``surface action group'' led by theWilliams, a guided-missile frigate, came under attack five timesfrom Iran's Silkworm anti-ship missile batteries.   Although Navy officers on the Williams identified the missilesas Silkworms, the Pentagon and Adm. William Crowe, chairman of theJoint Chiefs of Staff, did not confirm they were the Chinese-maderockets. The Pentagon said today it was still analyzing the attack.   ``Silkworm incoming,'' blared the bridge, lurching the JackWilliams into violent maneuvers.   Crewmen scrambled to spot the oncoming missiles.   ``Everybody look astern! Everybody look astern!'' Lt. AugustinoPonturier, the officer of the deck, shouted to junior officers andlookouts.   The gas turbine-drive frigate rolled sharply and pointed itsstern toward the approaching missile, presenting its smallesttarget and allowing the aluminum-chaff launchers and otherdefensive weapons a clear shot.   None of the first four Silkworms came close enough to be seenbut members of a helicopter crew and a fire detail hit the deck asthe fifth crossed behind the ship and slammed into a distant oilrig with an orange-yellow flash.   Officers aboard the ship were elated with the response system.   ``Not one of these ladies has a scratch on her, and the otherguys can't say that,'' said Capt. Don Dyer, operational commanderof the force.   In all, six Iranian ships were damaged by U.S. fire Monday.   Dyer said a C-130 aircraft that was spotting targets for theSilkworm batteries was tracked by U.S. jets off the nuclear-poweredaircraft carrier Enterprise and was almost shot down.   U.S. officials reported one U.S. helicopter with two crewmembers aboard missing Monday, and the search for it continuedtoday. They denied Iranian claims that the vessel was shot down.   The Williams, with members of a Pentagon news media pool aboard,was the operational flagship for one of the three ``surface actiongroups'' taking part in the fighting Monday in the southern gulf.   The others in the group were the destroyers Joseph Strauss andO'Brien.   Monday's operations began when U.S. warships destroyed twoIranian-owned oil platforms.   Over the next few hours, U.S. Navy forces sank two missile-armedpatrol boats, damaged two others and bombed and rocketed twofrigates.   One of the Iranian frigates, the Sahand, was hit by a Harpoonmissile fired from the Strauss.   The white missile roared skyward in a cloud of smoke andstreaked for the horizon, as the men on the Williams' bridgecheered wildly, ``Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!''   A flash and white smoke erupted on the horizon, followed by along series of heavy explosions as the weapons and ammunitionaboard the Sahand blew up.   Lt. Cmdr. Mark Van Dyke, a spokesman for the Navy's Joint TaskForce Middle East, said a U.S. pilot who observed the Sahandreported it ``listing badly, with a big hole in its port side, thesuperstructure on fire and a lifeboat with some survivors in thewater.''   Shortly after, F-14 jet fighters from the Enterprise attackedthe Sahand's sister frigate, the Sabalan, after it fired a missileat the aircraft.   U.S. Army Maj. Barry Willey, a Central Command officeraccompanying the media pool, said the view from the bridge atop theWilliams was ``both spectacular and frightening _ contrails frommissiles could be seen in almost every direction.''   The oil platform attacks were aimed at what U.S. officialscalled military targets. Both the Sassan and Sirri platforms havebeen used by the Iranians for military purposes, they say.   The strikes were ordered after the frigate Samuel B. Roberts hita mine, which U.S. officials say was laid by Iran, in the centralgulf last Thursday. Ten crewman were injured.   While other task groups were attacking the platforms, theWilliams' unit was sailing halfway through the Strait or Hormuz, incalm seas, under clear skies within range of the Iranian Silkwormbatteries.   Van Dyke said the misssion of the three ships was to ``exercisethe right of innocent transit passage and respond to allcontingencies.''   And that's when the missile attacks came, apparently the firsttime Iran had fired the Chinese-made rockets at ships in the Straitof Hormuz and the southern gulf.   Later Monday, as the Williams and its accompanying warshipssailed out of the ``Silkworm envelope'' into safer waters and asetting sun, the alert level was lowered from ``general quarters''to the next lowest, ``condition one-alpha.''   Ponturier, of Red Bank, N.J., took off his steel helmet andwalked toward the door. ``It's Miller time,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
