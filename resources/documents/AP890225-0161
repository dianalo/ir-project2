In the stock market, the Dow Jones industrial average skidded43.92 points to close Friday at 2,245.54. It was the biggest dailydrop since November.   In the broader market, seven stocks fell for every two that roseamong issues listed on the New York Stock Exchange.   Bond prices lost as much as $4 for every $1,000 in face value,sending interest rates higher with yields on 30-year bonds climbingto 9.18 percent from 9.14 percent late Thursday.   Short-term interest rates finished even higher: one-year Treasurybills were yielding 9.50 percent late Friday, offering investors apowerful incentive to dump stocks.   The dollar finished mixed in foreign exchange trading.   Gary Schlossberg, senior economist for Wells Fargo Bank in SanFrancisco, said he expects interest rates will move even higherbefore the economy slows enough to relieve inflationary pressures, agoal the Fed has set for itself.   ``The Fed will will have to continue to tighten a bit moreaggressively. A modest interest rate increase on the order of onepercentage point should be enough to cool the economy offsufficiently,'' he said.   Such a move would increase chances that the economy could fallinto a recession, another worry for stock investors trying to divinethe outlook for corporate profits.   But, Schlossberg said, he believes ``the economy has enoughinherent strength'' that there is a better than even chance arecession will avoided.   Before the stock market opened Friday, the Federal Reserveboosted its discount rate, its charge on loans to member banks, by ahalf percentage point to a three-year high of 7 percent.   Boosting the discount rate is the central bank's most dramaticsignal that it intends to tighten credit and slow economic growth,thus reducing borrowing, wage and price demands.   Some analysts said the Fed's move was overdue, especially inlight of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's statements thathe found recent inflation ``disturbing'' and that the bank wouldcontinue erring on the side of retraint in fighting it.   Fears about accelerating inflation have heightened in recentweeks with news that wholesale prices shot up 1 percent in Januaryand that consumer prices were up 0.6 percent last month, theirbiggest jump in two years.   Until Friday, the central bank's moves had largely been conductedbehind the scenes, such as the draining of reserves from the bankingsystem, a maneuver that forces some banks to borrow to meet capitalrequirements.   The discount rate hike followed Chase Manhattan Bank'sannouncement after the stock market closed on Thursday that it wasboosting its prime lending rate, a benchmark lending charge thataffects rates paid on commercial, home and other consumer loans, to11{ percent from 11 percent.   Other major banks matched Chase's increase on Friday. It was thesecond half percentage point rise in the prime rate in the last twoweeks.   The Fed last raised the discount rate in August, to 6.5 percentfrom 6 percent. The discount rate last was at 7 percent from March7, 1986, to April 18, 1986, when it dropped to 6.5 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
