Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng decided to relax planting restrictions after government analysts forecast a 31% plunge in the corn harvest this fall and projected a substantial decline in the U.S. corn supply by Oct. 1, 1989.    For the administration, it was perhaps the most crucial farm-policy decision since the drought of the 1930s. If Mr. Lyng allowed farmers to plant corn, barley and sorghum fence-row to fence-row next spring, the U.S. could rapidly return to price-depressing gluts. But if he didn't give farmers a free enough hand, shortages might develop next fall, driving up consumer prices and forcing the U.S. to cut back drastically on farm exports.    In trying to strike a balance, Mr. Lyng also was mindful of the potential political fallout in an election year. He gave the major commodity groups basically what they wanted: Farmers will be required to idle only 10% of their feed-grain acreage next year under the government's so-called set-aside program. They had been required to take 20% out of production this year in order to qualify for price-support loans and subsidy payments, and they had the option of collecting land-diversion payments for idling another 10%. But Mr. Lyng decided the drought obviated the need for such a &quot;paid-diversion&quot; program in 1989.    Several private analysts predicted that the new set-aside requirement would boost corn plantings to 77 million acres next year from this year's 67.5 million. A few forecast 80 million acres. &quot;You have the potential of very large plantings and an eight billion bushel-plus crop,&quot; said Michael Hall, executive vice president of the National Corn Growers Association. &quot;Assuming normal weather, it could be a repeat of 1985, a bumper year.&quot;    Government analysts don't foresee such a large expansion. They expect farmers to switch two million acres of corn to soybeans next year under a provision of the $3.9 billion drought-relief law, which gives them greater flexibility in planting. As a result, government analysts expect a corn planting of 73 million acres. They also expect barley and sorghum plantings to increase by about one million acres each next year.    Under the 1985 farm law, the set-aside requirement can be no more than 12.5% of the feed-grain acreage if the nation's corn stockpile is projected to fall below two billion bushels by Oct. 1, 1989. The Agriculture Department has forecast a drop to 1.6 billion, enough to meet domestic needs and export demand for only 10 weeks.    For budget reasons, the White House's Office of Management and Budget pressed for a 12.5% set-aside, rather than 10%. The higher set-aside would save the government an estimated $525 million in subsidies over three years, according to the Agriculture Department.    But Mr. Lyng prevailed in the internal budget battle, partly by raising the possibility of another drought and by citing the current outbreak of aflatoxin in the Midwest corn crop. Aflatoxin is a fungus-produced contaminant, known to cause cancer in certain laboratory animals.    &quot;Aflatoxin is the big unknown,&quot; said Ewen Wilson, assistant agriculture secretary for economics. &quot;Nobody knows how widespread it is.&quot;    Mr. Lyng's decision was disappointing for grain companies and food processors that had lobbied him for a minimal set-aside requirement. But he let the current 5% set-aside for oats stand. Cereal makers and others are having to import significant amounts of oats because of plunging U.S. production, a problem aggravated by the drought.    Mr. Lyng also denied a request from several major brewers that malting barley growers in Minnesota and the Dakotas be exempted from the set-aside requirement for feed-grain barley. The brewers, including Miller Brewing Co., Milwaukee, and Anheuser-Busch Inc., St. Louis, fear that they will run out of malting barley by next fall because of the drought. Without assurances now of a bigger crop next year, they say they must begin making arrangements to import malting barley from France.    Mr. Lyng also set the 1989 target prices for corn at $2.84 a bushel, for sorghum at $2.70, for barley at $2.43 and for oats at $1.50. If market prices fall below the target prices, the government subsidizes farmers with so-called deficiency payments.    At the same time, Mr. Lyng set the 1989 loan rates for corn at $1.65 a bushel, for sorghum at $1.57, for barley at $1.34 and for oats at 85 cents. Loan rates act as price supports for farmers, who take out government loans for spring planting and pledge their crops as collateral. If market prices fall below the loan rates, farmers default on their loans and turn their grain over to the government. </TEXT></DOC>
