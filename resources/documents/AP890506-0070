Pete V. Domenici spent six years aschairman of the Senate Budget Committee fighting off attempts toderail the spending plans he produced.   But last week, the former chairman who's still central to anybudget deal dared other senators to take him on. ``I welcome thosewho have something better to offer. I hope they will bring it downhere,'' said Domenici, R-N.M.   Almost nobody did, and those were brushed away by byoverwhelming margins. In the House, debate was more carefullyscripted but the results were the same.   The deficit-reduction agreement reached last month betweenPresident Bush and congressional leaders has been accepted by therank and file, 68-31 in the Senate and 263-157 in the House.   Although fine details remain to be worked out between the twochambers, the final budget for fiscal 1990 will claim to reduce thedeficit by about $28 billion.   There are no daring cutbacks in spending, only some slowergrowth, not a hint that any federal program will be eliminated.Federal assets would be sold, government fees raised, and a callfor $5.3 billion in new tax revenues maybe can be done withoutviolating Bush's ``no new taxes'' campaign pledge.   ``Calling $5.3 billion in new taxes something other than a taxshould be a snap for President Bush,'' said Senate Majority LeaderGeorge Mitchell, D-Maine, recalling the dozen or so times PresidentReagan was able to accomplish that rhetorical feat.   The budgets claim to reach the Gramm-Rudman law's requirement ofa deficit no larger than $100 billion in the fiscal year beginningOct. 1. But critics argue that the unspecified tax boost is justone of many instances of hocus-pocus in the budget documents.   Billions of dollars of ``savings'' are nothing more thanbookkeeping changes, such as declaring the Postal Service``off-budget'' and deeming a half-billion dollars in old,unredeemed food stamps as no longer a government liability.   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., chairman of Congress' Joint EconomicCommittee, described the White House-congressional alliance asthis: ``They provide the smoke, and we provide the mirrors.''   Sen. James Sasser, the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee,acknowledged the shortcomings of the plan and said he hoped moredeficit reduction could be accomplished later.   ``I have sat through hours and hours and hours of sincere debatebetween honest and honorable men on virtually every possibleapproach to the budget problem, and this is the best that we can doat this particular time in our history,'' said Sasser, D-Tenn.   Stan Collender, a former congressional budget staff member whonow follows fiscal issues for a private accounting firm, said thelawmakers were just giving their constituents what they wanted.   People believe the deficit is a serious problem, but ``no onewants you to cut spending or raise taxes,'' he said.   As a result, Congress must resort to gimmickry and optimisticdeficit figures that make it seem like they are attacking thedeficit.   ``They feel compelled to deal with it in a way to make it appearthey've dealt with it in a serious way,'' he said.   Carol Cox, head of the Committee for a Responsible FederalBudget, disputes assertions that the general public isn't ready tosacrifice in order to reduce the economic threat of the deficit.   ``The public's so far ahead of their political leaders on thisone, it's a stitch,'' said Cox, who conducts public meetings aroundthe country to explore budget options.   The politicians are using their budget deals to ``provide coverfor one another... to avoid dealing with the harsh realities oflife,'' she said. The process is so far along, ``they're not evenembarrassed about it any more,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
