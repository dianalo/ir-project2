The appeals court in New Orleans, in a case involving theDallas bank holding company MCorp, said the Fed overreachedits authority in asserting the so-called source of strengthdoctrine. Under the doctrine, which the Fed made explicit inregulations in 1984 and 1987, bank holding companies wererequired to use their assets to aid their bank units &quot;duringperiods of financial stress or adversity.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Banking groups hailed the decision, saying it will removehuge potential liability that had hurt bank holding companiestrying to raise capital. &quot;This puts shareholders of bankholding companies on an even playing field with shareholdersof other financial institutions,&quot; said James McLaughlin, aregulatory attorney with the American Bankers Association.   Said Howard Cayne, a partner with Arnold andamp; Porter whohandled the case for MCorp: &quot;The effect of this decision isto leave the decision of whether to downstream capital intosubsidiary banks where it properly lies -- with the bankholding company's board of directors.&quot;   However, the decision also puts a dent in the Fed'sattempt to reduce the cost to the government from bankfailures. The estimated cost of bailing out depositors at 20MCorp banks that failed last March is about $2 billion. Aspokesman for the Fed hadn't seen the decision and had nocomment.   MCorp and federal regulators have been bickering over thebanking concern's holding company assets since October 1988,when MCorp first conceded that it wouldn't be able to weatherthe Texas financial collapse without some form of federalaid.   At that time, the Fed and the Federal Deposit InsuranceCorp., concerned about the potential bailout cost, beganpressuring MCorp to shore up the capital of its 25 bankingsubsidiaries. Invoking the source-of-strength doctrine, theFed asked MCorp to identify the banking units that neededsupport and to specify the amount of capital it intended toinject.   But MCorp, which had recently amassed some $400 million byselling its credit-card and data-processing businesses,refused. Rather than pump money into the banks right away,MCorp hoped to use the assets as the cornerstone of amanagement-led recapitalization. Threatened with a possiblebankruptcy filing, the Fed temporarily backed off.   But after dissident bondholders forced MCorp into Chapter11 bankruptcy-law proceedings in March of last year -- andafter the FDIC took over all but five of MCorp's banks -- theFed renewed its efforts to pry money loose from the holdingcompany. It instituted new administrative proceedingscharging that MCorp had improperly obtained $63.7 million ofunsecured loans from two of its failed banking subsidiariesand alleged that the company hadn't acted as a source ofstrength to its remaining subsidiary banks.   MCorp responded with the lawsuit in federal court. MCorpcurrently has $482 million in holding company assets and istrying to sell its remaining five banks.   In the appeals court decision, Judge W. Eugene Davis saidthe Fed, which regulates bank holding companies, doesn't havethe &quot;authority to regulate the day-to-day financial soundnessof the subsidiary banks.&quot; He also said a refusal by MCorp totransfer assets doesn't constitute an &quot;unsafe and unsoundpractice&quot; that would give the regulators the right to orderthe move.   Many banking attorneys have long believed that thesource-of-strength doctrine would fall in a court challenge,and the Fed has only rarely used the policy explicitly. Butthe threat of the policy has provided useful leverage againstbanks that didn't want to challenge the Fed. &quot;It's beenlurking,&quot; said Mr. McLaughlin of the ABA.   Congress and the Bush administration considered writingthe source-of-strength policy into law last year duringdeliberations on the bill that overhauled regulation of thethrift and banking industries. But they rejected that andpassed a provision under which subsidiary banks -- but notthe holding company -- must help the government bail outother troubled subsidiaries.</TEXT></DOC>
