In honor of the Palestinian uprising, city officials are refusingto sponsor holiday celebrations in the birthplace of Christ.   Israeli soldiers stood guard Tuesday as Israeli civiliansemployed by the army built a platform for a choir concert toentertain the hundreds of pilgrims who officials hope will come toworship in Bethlehem on Christmas Eve.   But Arab officials in this West Bank city have decreed that therewill be no municipal decorations this year and no traditionalholiday reception for diplomats or Boy Scouts on parade.   ``It is a protest for those killed, injured and detained,'' saidthe town's Palestinian Christian mayor, Elias Freij. ``The peopleare not in a mood to celebrate or rejoice.''   More than 330 Palestinians have died in clashes with the Israeliarmy since they launched their ``intefadeh,'' or uprising, againstIsrael's 21-year occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.   Thirteen Israelis also have died in the 12 months of unrest.   The underground leadership of the uprising has declared Dec. 24``a national day of mourning,'', calling a general strike to closeshops and restaurants on the normally busy holiday eve.   For its part, Israel's Tourism Ministry has tried to maintainsome semblance of Christmases past.   ``Nothing has changed in the intrinsic meaning of Christmas inBethlehem,'' it said in a statement. ``No secular municipal actionwill either dampen the religious fervor of pilgrims or mar theirfreedom of worship in Bethlehem.''   To this end, the ministry is sponsoring Christmas Eveperformances by choirs from Switzerland, Spain and the ShilohBaptist Church in Washington, D.C.   Roman Catholics, Anglicans and other Christian denominations haveput out pamphlets publicizing events ranging from the Catholicpatriarch's procession Saturday afternoon to midnight Masses inBethlehem chapels.   Just how many pilgrims will travel to Bethlehem for Christmasrites is uncertain. Tourism for the year is down 14 percent, andIsrael admits many potential visitors have been frightened away bythe daily reports of clashes.   Peace and joy were not part of the mood Tuesday on Manger Squareoutside the Church of the Nativity, which covers the grotto wherethe Bible says Christ was born.   Israeli soldiers lounging near the undecorated municipal treewere pelted with stones by Palestinian youths, who then fled up anarrow street in the Arab market. Street hawkers complained of badbusiness.   The holiday sadness extends deep into the Palestinian community,including among its Christians.   There are an estimated 35,000 Christian Arabs in the occupiedterritories and about 100,000 within Israeli borders, according toGeries S. Khoury, director of the Al-Liqa Center for ReligiousStudies and chairman of the religion program at Bethlehem University.   Khoury, a Greek Catholic, says there will be no Christmaspresents for his wife and four children, no festive dinner at hishome.   ``The only present I would like to give them is the story of thesuffering of my people,'' Khoury said.   Nicholas Canavati, owner of a large Bethlehem souvenir store,said he and other businessmen were called in by Israeli officialsthis week for what he described as ``a gentlemanly talk.''   He said the officials asked if it wouldn't be better for businessif stores got out their decorations.   ``I said yes,'' Canavati says. ``But I told them there are moreimportant things than business.''   His store remains unadorned, and he is unconvinced flashinglights and colored ornaments would be a lure.   ``Why should anyone come to Bethlehem when the town is full ofarms and soldiers rather than peace, which is the symbol after allof the man born here,'' Canavati said.</TEXT></DOC>
