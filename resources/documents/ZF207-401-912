 Students used facsimile machinesand satellite communications to send out information to colleaguesand friends overseas about what actually happened at TiananmenSquare on Jun 4, 1989.andP;  The current repressive regime in China hasdone whatever possible to cut off these communications and as aresult the students have had to adopt a lower profile.andP;  Meanwhile,the West must make sure that the communications lines remain open.andO;China's government officials know that communications lines areneeded to make the country a truly industrialized society.andP;  Aslong as the communications lines are open, hope remains that theidea of democracy in China will remain alive.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     China Democracy Movement, 1989International tradeTechnologyUser NeedsTelecommunication industryPolitical IssuesChina.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By John PallattoandM;Chinese students living in the West are demonstrating to the world that afacsimile machine can be as dangerous to a repressive regime as an AK-47assault rifle.andM;News organizations have published accounts of how Chinese students around theworld have tirelessly used satellite communications and fax technology to getaccurate news into China and to learn the fate of their compatriots backhome.andM;The students' novel use of information technology to remain in contact withthe tumultuous events in Beijing has heartened anyone who hopes for continuedreform and expanded freedom in China.andM;Sadly, news accounts of the students' ingenuity may be playing into the handsof government hard-liners, who carried out the bloody suppression of thepro-democracy movement.andM;The Chinese government is certainly aware that this technology provides openwindows to the outside world.andP;  These windows threaten its ability tomanipulate public opinion and to whitewash the bloodstains in TiananmenSquare.andM;The more the West reports on how Chinese students in the West use informationsystems to relay messages back to China, the sooner the Chinese governmentwill tap the lines to track down dissidents and eventually closecommunications loopholes.andM;The government has shown that it monitors Western news reports, and it hasn'thesitated to arrest and intimidate those who were shown on the eveningtelecasts criticizing the Communist Party and calling for greater freedom.andO;By this time the government is keeping watch over fax machines and satellitedishes to find out where the transmissions are coming from and who wassupposed to receive them.andM;The students aren't helping their cause by showing off their access to faxmachines, modems and satellite communications.andM;The fight for democracy in China has gotten very dirty.andP;  The only way theelectronic information network can survive in the short term is by goingunderground.andP;  Advocates of democracy must become as secretive as the regimethey're fighting.andM;The reform movement will have to continue its work surreptitiously until theday comes when the country is no longer ruled by old men who cling stubbornlyto a failed economic and political ideology.andM;Those old men have shown that they, too, are aware of the power of electroniccommunications and information systems.andM;Recent news reports suggest that the Chinese leadership learned the value ofelectronic funds-transfer systems when they dispersed more than $77 millionto secret foreign bank accounts in case they were overthrown by reformers andforced to flee the country.andM;The Chinese government has also used radio and television heavily to moldpublic opinion and induce people to inform on dissidents.andM;The leadership found it was easy to go on television and broadcast lies thatno pro-democracy demonstrators were killed when the People's Liberation Armymarched into Tiananmen Square.andP;  Electronic media has also allowed thegovernment to brand protesters as murderers and criminals while hailing thesoldiers as heroes.andM;In this environment, reform advocates will have little choice but to keep alow profile.andM;The best thing that could happen to the reform movement in China is a returnto nominal stability that will encourage the government to keep acquiringmodern communications and information technology.andM;The greatest danger to reform is if the government turns rabidly xenophobicand shuts off the flow of technology.andP;  Industrialized nations will likelyhelp snuff out the glimmering embers of reform if they try to punish theChinese government by banning the sale of information and telecommunicationstechnology to China.andM;An industrialized society cannot prosper in the world economy without moderninformation systems.andP;  Both the Soviet Union and China are aware that theycan't modernize their economies sufficiently to provide even basic humannecessities without up-to-date communications and computers.andM;It's no coincidence that the richest nations in the world are also those withthe most modern information and telecommunications networks.andM;China will have to continue acquiring modern information technology if itdoesn't wish to accept permanent status as a third-world nation.andM;The more people who have access to information systems, the more difficult itwill be for the Chinese government to wield absolute control over the flow ofinformation through the country.andM;A fax machine may not seem as menacing as the tanks and armed guards postedin China's cities.andP;  But a fax, like a computer and a telephone, is afountainhead of information and ideas.andP;  And the old men who rule China knowthere's nothing more dangerous than an idea.andM;Especially when the idea is democracy.andM;----------John Pallatto is a PC Week senior editor.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
