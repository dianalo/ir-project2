How important is it, for example, that a new analysis by Air Force intelligence concludes that the Soviets are far along in developing a nationwide anti-missile defense? This is surely an appropriate time to go back over the last time Air Force intelligence led the way in assessing Soviet strategic advances.    Our reflection occurs, we should add, against the backdrop of a classified briefing held last week for several members of the U.S. Senate. The senators heard both Air Force intelligence and the CIA discuss the evidence for an Air Force judgment that the Soviets are preparing to break out of the 1972 ABM treaty. (See WSJ editorial, &quot;Breakout,&quot; Feb. 25.) No doubt the CIA was concerned by the Air Force briefing, since only last year the CIA had helped reduce the &quot;national intelligence estimate&quot; of a breakout probability in the 1980s to only 10%. The Air Force, and we hear the Defense Intelligence Agency for that matter, is taking a far more alarming view now. Who's right?    The debate echoes back to a similar dispute 25 years ago. Throughout the 1960s, the U.S. intelligence community was consumed with analyzing Soviet nuclear-missile development. As the chart nearby demonstrates (see accompanying illustration -- WSJ March 9, 1988), however, U.S. analysts greatly underestimated actual Soviet deployments for more than a decade. Only the Air Force came close to getting it right, though even its analysts missed the magnitude of the Soviet nuclear buildup. The line marked &quot;estimated actual inventory&quot; in the chart shows the number of missile launchers the Soviets ultimately deployed.    In the folklore promoted by arms-control advocates, of course, U.S. analysts always are supposed to be imagining a &quot;missile gap&quot; that induces American politicians to fuel the &quot;arms race.&quot; The facts are, however, that even the most pessimistic U.S. analysts have tended to underestimate Soviet programs. As Albert Wohlstetter has pointed out, from 1962 to 1971 the low end of U.S. intelligence estimates never exceeded actual Soviet deployments. Even our high estimates caught the reality only nine times in 51 tries.    Analyzing intelligence is inherently a tricky business, of course, not least because the Soviets practice what's known in the trade as &quot;data denial.&quot; Their military units are warned when U.S. satellites are about to pass overhead. They also use camouflage or operate only at night. One consequence is that the U.S. failed to detect construction of the Soviet radar at Krasnoyarsk for more than two years, though the site is as large as four football fields. These Soviet practices persist with or without detente.    Which brings us back to what could be called the ABM gap. Since at least the mid-1970s, U.S. intelligence has observed signs of enormous Soviet investment in missile defense. While the U.S. was dropping plans for its &quot;Safeguard&quot; ABM system in the 1970s, the Soviets deployed and then upgraded their system around Moscow. While the U.S. endlessly debates SDI, the Soviets are deploying a nationwide system of radars with battle-management capability. In sum, the ABM treaty's main contribution to &quot;slowing the arms race&quot; has been to make sure that only one side is even running in it.    With the fever for ramming through arms-control agreements what it is today, we suspect this most recent Air Force analysis hasn't been very welcome in Washington. No doubt the Reagan administration would find it hard to explain why it is pursuing new treaties with the Soviets when intelligence suggests the more pressing issue is whether the U.S. ought to withdraw from an old one. Indeed, it's certainly fair to ask why the ABM treaty's five-year review, already five months overdue, hasn't even begun yet.    At the very least, the Reagan administration should explain why it wants to sign an agreement reducing America's nuclear arsenal by 50% when our remaining nuclear deterrent could be degraded significantly by a Soviet defense. The U.S. of course would continue to have no defense against a Soviet first strike. We wouldn't be surprised if a growing number of senators found this a remarkable, and unsupportable, condition for U.S. security. </TEXT></DOC>
