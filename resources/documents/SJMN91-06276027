That means unneeded management employeescould be laid off for the first time in Pac Bell history.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Business  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  PAC BELL WILL END ITS NO-LAYOFF POLICY  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     Until then, Pac Bell said it will seek to eliminate 3,000 management jobs-- or about 17 percent of the company's 18,400 management positions -- byoffering early retirement packages and enhanced severance benefits.;   &quot;Theplain fact is, we need fewer management employees,&quot; said Sam Ginn, chairman ofPacific Telesis, the San Francisco holding company that owns Pac Bell.;  Pacific Telesis announced a plan in January 1990 to trim 11,000 jobs from itstotal payroll of 62,000 by 1995. So far, the workforce is down by only 3,100to 58,900.;   &quot;After nearly two years, it is clear to me we are not reducingas quickly as we must,&quot; Ginn said in a prepared statement. &quot;Competition in ourmarkets is growing faster than ever. We need to pick up the pace if we are toreach our goal.&quot;;   American Telephone andamp; Telegraph, which controlled almostall of the nation's long-distance and local telephone service before acourt-ordered break-up in 1984, long had an informal &quot;employment for life&quot;policy. Workers at the phone company knew that Ma Bell would always take careof them.;   But aftershocks of the ATandamp;T break-up, which created PacificTelesis to provide local phone service in California and Nevada, are graduallyforcing Pac Bell and other phone companies to become more competitive. At thesame time, new technology is greatly reducing the number of employees neededto provide service.;   The Communications Workers of America, a unionrepresenting about 40,000 Pac Bell employees, got an employment securityagreement in 1986 allowing Pac Bell to eliminate jobs in exchange for aguarantee that workers would be re-trained and assigned to new positions. PacBell then offered the same deal to its non-union management employees.;   Now,Pac Bell is eliminating that protection for managers. Lou Saviano, a spokesmanat Pac Tel headquarters in San Francisco, said he didn't know if the companywould seek to eliminate employment security for union members after the CWA'scontract expires next August.;   Harry Ibsen, an international vice presidentat the CWA office in Burlingame, said it &quot;is certainly a concern&quot; for theunion.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  MIKE LANGBERG, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911002  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  October  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1F  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  415  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday, October 2, 199100276027,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
