(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Some people collect stamps, otherscollect coins. Torrey Tellefsen collects college degrees.   Tellefsen, 38, says he's earned 900 to 1,000 college credit hoursat 39 colleges around the country. He has a box filled with 30two-year associate degrees in fields including businessadministration and criminal justice. At least four colleges haveawarded him bachelor's degrees.   ``In terms of his academic record, he is the most unique person Ihave ever met, or anyone has ever met,'' said Larry Hungerford,Tellefsen's adviser at Winston-Salem State University.   Tellefsen has yet to complete a graduate degree, but Wake ForestUniversity says he's a few hours short of completing a law degree;he's working on a master's in counseling at North Carolina Aandamp;T StateUniversity; and is completing courses for a master's degree inbusiness at North Carolina Central University.   His goal is to earn 12 master's degrees and at least onedoctorate, probably in education.   ``That will be a lot more impressive,'' he said recently.   Tellefsen says he has attended four or five colleges at the sametime in his quest for knowledge. He traces his desire to learn tohis 20s, when he worked minimum-wage jobs.   ``A lot of guys would give me orders, and the only difference wasthat they had degrees. I wanted to try to be on the same level withthese people.''   Tellefsen supports himself on student loans and occasionalpart-time jobs, and says he owes the federal government about$49,000 that he'll have to pay back when he finally leaves school.   ``I'll have to make sure I get a good job,'' he said.</TEXT><DATELINE>THIEF RIVER FALLS, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   When the snow gets moose-bellydeep in this part of the country, the moose get going.   The only problem is they go to town, where they wander thestreets and dine on apple trees and hedges.   When residents have had enough, police usually herd the animalsback across the frozen Thief River by slowly driving alongside,yelling, honking or sounding the siren.   But three persistent moose just aren't taking the hint, andpolice recently have taken to firing special exploding shells tofrighten them.   ``We chase them out and they just come back,'' said officer TimMiller, who has chased the cow and her calves three times in oneweek.</TEXT><DATELINE>SPARTA, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   When Tracy Parry and Darrell Whitehead gotmarried, the minister might as well have opened by saying, ``Deerlybeloved ...'   The bride and groom, wearing camouflage, had to use a ladder toclimb a tree to get to the deer hunting stand where she and thegroom were married on Valentine's Day.   Nancy Whitehead, the groom's mother, said the couple originallyhad planned to marry in a church ceremony.   ``She had already bought her gown and they had chosen theirattendants,'' she said. ``Then she said, `I'd just like to getmarried at our deer stand.' She really just said it as a joke.''   But the thought kept coming back.   ``We didn't have time to plan a formal wedding since we wanted toget married on Valentine's Day,'' said Whitehead, a 33-year-old mailcarrier. ``We just joked about the deer stand and the idea sort ofgrew. Since we were paying for our own wedding, it was cheaper,too.''   It was the same stand from which the new Mrs. Whitehead bagged adeer last year.   ``She'd never shot a gun in her life,'' said Whitehead.</TEXT></DOC>
