<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-74-1067 </DOCNO><TEXT>An X-ray dosimeter has been investigated with the use of a charge injectiontype condenser. The detector is small size and it housed in an epoxyresin approximately 4.5 x 2.5 x 1.5 mm. The X-ray dose can be determinedby decreasing the amount of electron injected into floating gate throughX-ray irradiation. The X-ray irradiation dose can be measured by decreasingof the capacitance. This dosimeter shows good linearity but the X-rayenergy response for low energy region is higher than high energy region.</TEXT></DOC>
