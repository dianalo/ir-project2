HarrisWofford, the Democratic underdog in next month's Senateelection in Pennsylvania, blisters GOP opponent DickThornburgh's record as U.S. attorney general.   The ad blasts Mr. Thornburgh for dereliction ininvestigating the scandal-ridden Bank of Credit andamp; CommerceInternational. It attacks him for failure to track down moneystolen in the savings-and-loan scandals. It slams him for aconflict of interest in refusing to appoint a specialprosecutor to examine the role of Neil Bush, the president'sson, as director of a failed Sandamp;L.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Thornburgh's strategists have a new negative attack onMr. Wofford, too. It's a commencement speech Mr. Wofforddelivered 23 years ago at Webster University, in St. Louis,in which he said that &quot;clearly the education women need is tobe good amateurs . . . {education} that will help them choosetheir husbands well.&quot;   Mr. Wofford's canny handlers aren't impressed. &quot;Whocares?&quot; says one.   In a campaign the Republicans are desperate to win, Mr.Thornburgh, a two-term former governor, remains the favorite.But Mr. Wofford, a cerebral Democrat who has been thepresident of two universities, is making a race of it --thanks largely to a tough band of guerrilla campaigners ledby senior strategist James Carville and his deputy, PaulBegala, and by media consultants Robert Shrum and David Doak.   &quot;This is fun,&quot; says Mr. Carville, a striking figure inpinstriped downtown Philadelphia in his trademark skintightblue jeans. &quot;It's like getting a free kick in a soccer game.&quot;   In the end, win or lose, Mr. Wofford and his supportershope they will have given disheartened national Democrats aninkling of how they might challenge George Bush in nextyear's presidential race.   Two key lessons for Democrats emerge from the Keystonestate, which hasn't elected a Democratic senator since 1962:   -- Take the fight to the opposition. Put them on thedefensive. And, when they attack, hit back, fast.   -- And when discussing the issues, emphasize working-classand middle-class concerns. Play down programs aimed tobenefit the very poor.   From the start, the Wofford campaign lobbed one grenadeafter another into the lethargic Thornburgh camp. Mr.Wofford's strategists charged that Mr. Thornburgh afterleaving the Justice Department accepted a &quot;sweetheart deal&quot;with a Pittsburgh law firm that pays him $1,000 a week fordoing nothing. Then they recruited what seemed to be everysenior-citizens organization in the state to say that aThornburgh ad touting his record helping older people wasriddled with inaccuracies. Mr. Thornburgh's camp -- thecandidate himself isn't giving any interviews -- denied thecharges in both situations.   Mr. Carville and others pounded away at what they say aremajor shifts in Mr. Thornburgh's stand on important issues.&quot;Once he opposed the death penalty,&quot; says Mr. Carville. &quot;Nowhe favors it for jaywalking.&quot;   In the midst of it, Mr. Thornburgh's campaign manager,Michele Davis, was quoted in every media outlet in the stateas saying that Mr. Thornburgh, when elected, would be the&quot;salvation&quot; of this &quot;sorryassed state.&quot; The Wofford team hada field day with that one.   The early GOP strategy was singleminded -- to remindvoters that Mr. Thornburgh, as governor from 1979 to 1987,held the line on taxes and spending. That plays off againstvoters' resentment at tax increases imposed by DemocraticGov. Robert Casey, who named Mr. Wofford as interim senatorto fill the vacancy created by the death of Republican Sen.John Heinz in an airplane crash last April. The winner of thespecial election on Nov. 5 -- the only Senate election in thecountry this year -- will serve the remaining three years ofMr. Heinz's term.   &quot;They did have us reacting,&quot; says Ms. Davis, Mr.Thornburgh's campaign manager. But now, working with mediaconsultant Greg Ste- vens, an associate of Bush media adviserRoger Ailes, the Thornburgh machine is lurching into actionwith negative ads attacking Mr. Wofford.   Their first negative ad, aired this week, charges that Mr.Wofford, as state Democratic chairman in 1986, &quot;presided overone of the most negative campaigns ever.&quot; That was the yearMr. Carville made his mark here. His candidate, Mr. Casey,defeated Republican William Scranton Jr. with the help of aTV ad showing old photos of a long-haired Mr. Scranton in thedays when he was a marijuana-smoking hippie. The Thornburghad also charges that Mr. Wofford ran big deficits when he waspresident of Bryn Mawr College (Mr. Wofford says that, infact, he put the college back on the path toward fiscalsolvency).   The biggest problem for the Wofford campaign is that Mr.Thornburgh is a familiar figure to almost everyone inPennsylvania. His opponents argue he is arrogant and aloof,but on the campaign trail he is warm and folksy. Mr. Woffordremains an unknown quantity to most Pennsylvanians stillstruggling to pronounce his name correctly (it rhymes withoffered). On the stump, he is frequently awkward anddiscursive.   With the help of President Bush, Vice President Quayle andmembers of the cabinet, Mr. Thornburgh will be able to spendjust about any sum he thinks necessary to win this race. TheWofford campaign is always strapped for cash.   For all the negative advertising, there are some positiveaspects of this campaign. Mr. Thornburgh has proposed federalinitiatives to rehabilitate the abandoned factories that dotthis old industrial state, to establish enterprise zones thatwould provide new jobs in distressed neighborhoods and tosupply assistance to small businesses to attend overseastrade fairs.   As for Mr. Wofford, he has discovered health care as ahot-button issue in a state where more than one-third of thevoters are 60 years of age or older. &quot;People in Washington,&quot;he says, &quot;are beginning to understand that Americans areready, finally, for a nationalized health-care system.&quot; Mr.Wofford's most successful positive TV ad says, &quot;If criminalshave the right to a lawyer, I think working Americans havethe right to a doctor.&quot;   Mr. Wofford also receives a positive response to his adsand speeches attacking special trade agreements with placeslike China and Mexico. If the agreement with Mexico passes,he says jobs will be lost in Pennsylvania, which has alreadybeen pummeled by bad times. In a kicker his strategists saycould be used nationally, Mr. Wofford, who helped found thePeace Corps more than 30 years ago, argues, &quot;I think it'stime for America to help Americans for a change. It's time totake care of our own.&quot;   Mr. Wofford is targeting his campaign at working-class andmiddle-class voters who have tended to abandon the DemocraticParty because of their concerns that it no longer caresenough about their problems.   &quot;I believe our party has let itself get too deeplyinvolved in targeting programs for the very poor,&quot; says Mr.Wofford. The other side of the coin, he argues, is that Mr.Thornburgh, once widely perceived as a moderate, has moved tothe right in a party &quot;that favors the rich and powerful.&quot;   Mr. Carville never passes up a chance to note that Mr.Thornburgh has boasted of his familiarity with the &quot;corridorsof power&quot; in Washington. &quot;What's that mean, he bounced somechecks?&quot; says Mr. Carville.   &quot;Wofford's making inroads by coming across as thechallenger in this race,&quot; says G. Terry Madonna, a politicalscientist at Millersville State University. &quot;I think it'sgoing to be very close.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
