The latest move came yesterday, when Intel Corp., thelargest U.S. semiconductor company, announced an alliancewith Japanese consumer electronics maker Sharp Corp. todevelop and manufacture the new chips, called &quot;flash&quot;memories.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;I want the year 2000 to be here today,&quot; said Intelgeneral manager Richard Pashley at a news conference here,after stating that the flash technology would make possible a$200, half-pound, half-inch-thick, fully powered personalcomputer with a 200-hour battery life by the end of thedecade. Others in the industry expect chip-based, pen-sizetape recorders and electronic novels to become available inthe next few years.   Enthusiasts say the chips are smaller, lighter, moredurable and more power-efficient than conventional methods oflong-term information storage, such as disk drives andcompact disks. Many analysts predict world-wide sales forflash memories will grow tenfold to $1.45 billion by 1995;some say it could reach $10 billion within 10 years.   Skeptics question whether the currently pricey chips willever become so widespread. But the Intel-Sharp pact is onlythe latest sign of growing industry interest in flashtechnology, so called because of the rapid speed with whichit can erase old information and store new data. Intel hasabout 85% of today's small world-wide market for flashmemories, but NEC Corp., Japan's biggest chip maker, ToshibaCorp. and Mitsubishi Electric Corp. all have announcedproducts recently. Almost every major U.S. and Japaneseelectronics company last fall accepted a common industrystandard facilitating the use of flash chips in personalcomputers and other products.   Indeed, even before a mass market has developed, flashmemories are sparking a trade spat. Intel and other U.S.companies say they fear a campaign by their Japanese rivalsto slash prices and drive them out of the market, as they sayhappened in the mid-1980s with other memory devices. The U.S.industry is asking Washington to apply special rules to flashchips that would accelerate tariffs against Japanese importsif dumping is suspected. The Commerce Department in Decemberissued a preliminary finding in favor of the U.S. companies,and a final decision is expected by next month.   Still, the Intel-Sharp agreement reflects U.S. companies'growing dependence on Japanese rivals, even when theAmericans have the technological edge. Intel is trading itsadvanced flash knowledge to Sharp in part simply to spreadthe huge financial burden of developing and producing futuregenerations of flash memories. Intel has a similar butnarrower arrangement with Japan's NMB Semiconductor Co.,which will begin making flash chips this year.   Intel also sought a partner because its marketing arm isgeared mainly to computer makers, while flash chips areexpected to find a broader market that will includeconsumer-electronics companies, such as Sharp, which makes acomputerlike electronic organizer called the Wizard. The U.S.consumer-electronics industry has all but disappeared, andU.S. chip companies have had difficulties selling to thedominant Japanese manufacturers. Intel hopes the Sharpalliance will represent a step toward penetrating the market.   Without Sharp, &quot;we would not be able to come up with themanufacturing capacity we would need,&quot; says Intel senior vicepresident Robert W. Reed. Under the agreement, the companieswill blend design teams, and Sharp will begin making theflash chips by 1994. The companies declined to disclose otherdetails.   Intel's current dominance in flash chips represents areversal of the usual industry pattern of U.S. companiesdeveloping ideas whose manufacture Japanese rivals thenperfect. Toshiba invented the flash memory concept in 1984,but now ranks third in sales with about 3% of the market.   Toshiba has said it now trails because it decided toconcentrate instead on developing more mainstream memorychips. A Toshiba spokesman adds that &quot;flash is still a nicheproduct&quot; and that the company expects to regain share as themarket grows, particularly in segments that requirelower-priced flash memory such as voice recording fortelephone-answering machines.   The appeal of flash memory is that it apparently overcomessome of the fundamental tradeoffs prevalent in informationstorage and manipulation. In computers, most short-termstorage is electronic (on silicon chips such as dynamicrandom access memories, or DRAMs), but long-term storageinvolves transmittal to magnetic devices (hard and floppydisks) or optical devices (compact disks).   Though these methods of long-term storage can handlemillions of pieces of data, they require moving mechanicalparts, which slows storage and retrieval, drains power, addsweight and makes the computer more vulnerable to damage. Theneed for disk drives, for example, makes it difficult to cutthe weight of a notebook computer much below five pounds orto extend battery life much beyond two hours.   Storing information permanently on silicon would eliminatethe moving parts and their accompanying drawbacks. But mostbasic memory chips, such as DRAMs, are &quot;volatile&quot;: They canremember information only as long as power is running throughthem; when the power is shut off, they forget everything.   &quot;Nonvolatile&quot; chips exist, but generally suffer theopposite problem: It's hard to change the data stored on thesilicon. Doing so on most such chips requires a long, costlyprocedure using ultraviolet light. That makes them useful forrepetitive tasks, such as controlling auto engines, butimpractical for computer data storage.   Flash chips combine the best of both worlds. They're&quot;nonvolatile,&quot; but they can change the information relativelysimply, using basic electrical charges.   Flash technology is already suited to portable goods thatdon't require huge amounts of storage space, many analystsand industry executives say, and its evolution will makepossible a range of new products. In addition to computerdisks, Sharp executive vice president Atsushi Asada saysflash chips could replace many conventionalinformation-storage methods, such as photo film, audiocassette tapes, even printed books.   That remains to be seen. So far, the biggest creditcard-size storage devices made of flash chips store only fourmegabytes of information, while most notebook PCs have harddisk drives that can store 40 megabytes. As theComputerLetter newsletter in New York recently noted, diskdrives cost only about $5 per megabyte -- or one millionbytes of storage space -- while, even after price cuts of 50%announced last week, Intel flash cards still cost about $120per megabyte.   In addition, critics say, flash chips can't yet match thelong-term durability of disk drives. And most computersoftware would have to be rewritten to accommodate them.Meanwhile, prices of magnetic and optical disk drives aredropping.   &quot;Flash will enable a number of new applications toexplode, but in the near term, replacing floppies and harddisks isn't possible,&quot; says Nicolas Samaras of DataquestInc., a technology market research firm. &quot;Some of thosestatements are self-serving for the immediate future.&quot;   But Intel's Mr. Pashley says most technical problems havebeen solved and prices will drop as production rises. He saysIntel will announce next-generation flash chips with lowerprices this spring.</TEXT></DOC>
