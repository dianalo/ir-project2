MANN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadzesaid Thursday that Israel must agree to talk with the PLO and acceptan international peace conference as the price of renewingdiplomatic relations.   PLO chief Yasser Arafat said the Soviets are providing him anindirect channel to the Israelis through increased contacts set upthis week in Cairo.   Shevardnadze met separately with Arafat and Israeli ForeignMinister Moshe Arens in Cairo on Wednesday. He flew to Baghdad onThursday.   On arrival in the Iraqi capital, he told reporters: ``Theprospects of a solution to the Middle East look good and morerealistic ... because of the PLO's peace overtures.''   Shevardnadze planned to visit Iran after Iraq and then head home,and Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency reported that Shevardnadzewill be granted a rare audience with Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeiniduring the visit. The report was monitored in Cyprus.   In a speech to politicians in Cairo, Shevardnadze said: ``Wewould like the government of Israel to know that once it opts forthe conference and agrees to a dialogue with the PalestineLiberation Organization, our two countries could take yet anotherstep toward re-establishing full diplomatic relations.   ``The beginning of the conference would be a starting point forresumed relations,'' he said. Relations were severed after the 1967Middle East war.   Israel opposes a U.N.-organized conference but has said it wouldgo to one under the auspices of the United States and the SovietUnion. Israel, however, has said it will not talk with the PLO,which it considers a terrorist organization.   Under the plan proposed by Moscow, the Soviet Union, the UnitedStates and the other three permanent members of the U.N. SecurityCouncil would attend such a conference, along with Israel, the PLOand other regional parties.   ``Israel should not be afraid of the conference,'' Shevardnadzesaid. ``Our view is that (it) would indeed give a chance for ahistoric compromise between the Arabs and the Israelis.''   During their meeting, Arens rejected the idea. However, he saidafterward the Soviets have a role to play in Middle East peacemakingeven without diplomatic ties with Israel.   In Jerusalem, Israel's Hadashot newspaper said Arens andShevardnadze agreed to advance ties by making the consular officesin each country permanent.   In Cairo, Arafat told a news conference that his organization ispleased with the Soviet stand on relations with Israel.   Arafat also appeared pleased at the new Soviet-Israeli dialogue,which is to begin within days with meetings of Middle East expertsfrom the two countries. Shevardnadze and Arens are to meet again,although no date or place have been announced.   Asked about the results of Shevardnadze's meetings, the PLOleader noted:   ``Actually, it was indirect negotiations. ... He informed meabout what was mentioned by the Israeli delegation, and no doubt hewill inform the Israelis what I have mentioned.''   Mayor Teddy Kollek of Jerusalem indicated at a news conferencethere on Thursday that he would support formation of an independentPalestinian state in the occupied West Bank, but would never agreeto any part of Jerusalem serving as its capital, as the Arabs demand.   ``Not everything the Arabs want they can get,'' Kollek said.   The head of Israel's state-run television banned broadcast of aninterview with Arafat conducted by the station's reporter for Arabaffairs, the Israel Broadcast Authority said in Jerusalem onThursday.   Uri Porath, the authority's director general, said in a statementIsraeli law bars contacts between Israeli citizens and ``terroristorganizations.''   Shevardnadze complained to reporters after the speech aboutPresident Bush's comments relegating the Kremlin to a ``limitedrole'' in the Middle East.   ``The U.S. president said he was not concerned about the Sovietminister's tour of the region. That is basically quite right,''Shevardnadze said.   ``But in the end he made a qualification that I didn't like. Hesaid the role of the Soviet Union should be limited. That is verysad because it injects an element of rivalry that is unnecessary.''   He added with a smile: ``This is my first critical remark aboutthe president of the United States.''</TEXT></DOC>
