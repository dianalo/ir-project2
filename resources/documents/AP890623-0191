The aim of the amendment, approved by voice vote without dissent,is to circumvent the effect of a Supreme Court decision earlier inthe week which held that destruction of the flag is protected by theFirst Amendment guarantee of free speech.   ``I'm confident it's constitutional,'' Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del.,chairman of the judiciary panel and a leading congressional liberal,told his colleagues. Biden's measure was tacked onto an unrelatedchild care bill.   Biden's measure, which adds a new section to federal law dealingwith defacing U.S. property, makes it a misdemeanor to burn, trampleon, throw down or otherwise deface the flag.   Biden did not explain how the provision could be constitionalwhile similar provisions of existing federal law, under the Court'sdecision Wednesday, would not be. There was no one in his officeafter the Senate session, and no answer at Biden's home.   Earlier, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley said that while lawmakersare outraged by the high court decision of Wednesday, changing theConstitution should be viewed with caution.   Foley, D-Wash., said that ``nobody in the House supports flagburning. Everyone condemns it and believes that there is ... nojustification for the burning and disrespect to the American flag.''   But he said he would ``be extraordinarily slow to amend the FirstAmendment to the Constitution'' which is ``at the heart of ourconstitutional liberties and freedom.''   About 10 lawmakers have already introduced constitutionalamendments in the wake of the decision, Foley said. But any suchamendment should be the subject of lengthy hearings and discussionin Congress, he said.   It was possible the House would consider next week a resolutionsimilar to the one passed by the Senate this week expressingopposition to the view of the court.   Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois, a senior Republican on the HouseJudiciary Committee, said he was exploring ways of getting aroundthe decision without a constitutional amendment, possibly by takingaway from the Supreme Court jurisdiction over lawsuits on flagdesecration.   ``I think the mood of the House is to do something effective andnot just pass resolutions condemning the burning of the flag,'' hesaid. A new law would be simpler than a constitutional amendment, hesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
