A spokesman for the Treasury Department said Thursday he did notknow when a plan would be completed that would unblock Panamanianbank accounts and allow the Latin American country to collect backtaxes from the U.S. corporations that operate there.   President Bush called for the ``orderly unblocking of Panamaniangovernment assets'' held in the United States after the swearing-inof the democratically elected Guillermo Endara as president earlierthis week.   The sanctions were imposed by the Reagan administration topressure Gen. Manuel Noriega, the Panamanian dictator who has beenindicted in the United States on drug trafficking charges.   The United States cut off all military and economic aid in July1987. Further sanctions sharply restricted U.S. companies that dobusiness in Panama, froze Panamanian assets held in the UnitedStates, held payments relating to operating the Panama Canal inescrow and forbade American companies from paying taxes and fees tothe Noriega regime.   Companies were allowed either to put money due the Panamaniangovernment into escrow accounts overseen by the Federal ReserveBank or establish reserve accounts on their own books.   The Treasury spokesman said the government must develop a planthat ensures ``the assets go to the legitimate goverment'' and thatU.S. residents and corporations that made escrow payments to coverfees and taxes owed to Panama be given proper credit.   An official of a large U.S. company operating in Panama,speaking on condition of anonymity, said, ``There has been nosignal at this point from the administration as to those taxesgoing to this particular government.''   Economists have estimated that the sanctions cost Panama about$225 million last year, when the nation's gross domestic productfell 17 percent.   For Panama, gaining access to $375 million will mark the firststep in getting its economy in order.   ``It's not big money to us, but it's certainly big money tothem,'' said Robert Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities Co.International Inc.   As relations warm, U.S. banks will be more inclined to lend toPanama, where loan availability has been off sharply.   ``Noriega's access to the U.S. banking system ... was beingimpeded to the greatest extent that we could, and it's very hard torun a modern economy that way,'' Brusca said.   Panama owes the rest of the world about $5.3 billion. Though thefigure pales in comparison to other developing countries, it isextremely high on a per-capita basis. Panama's debt equals about$2,200 per capita while Brazil's debt is roughly $790 per capita,according to figures provided by the World Bank.   Panama first missed a payment to banks in mid-1987 and since hasfaced increasing difficulties servicing its debt, said Luis R.Luis, director of the Latin America department of the Institute forInternational Finance.   Luis said the money due Panama from the lifting of U.S.sanctions ``could be used to pay back the arrears. It would be avery good use of funds as far as banks are concerned.''   Experts said the lifting of sanctions would certainly improvePanamanian citizens' view of America.   ``This can really help to pull more of the people onto the U.S.side. If we can kick out the rat (Noriega) and lift sanctions, itwould improve the economic lot of a lot people,'' Brusca said.   In addition to lifting sanctions, the U.S. government said itwould not proceed with an order, which would have gone into effectat the end of January, barring ships bearing Panama's flag fromU.S. ports.   It was unclear whether a ban on the import of Panamanian sugarwould be lifted, but experts said the amount is insignificant andthat sugar is a minor factor in Panama's economy.</TEXT></DOC>
