Two outside directors declined to comment last night on what had transpired.    Mr. Jacobs, chairman of Minstar Inc., said he hadn't been contacted by Borg-Warner about Minstar's sweetened bid for the 87.6% of Borg-Warner that his group doesn't own. After the meeting a Borg-Warner spokesman said only, &quot;We'll stick with no comment.&quot;    Minstar said last week it would offer at least $44 a share, or $3.29 billion, for the Chicago-based plastics, automotive parts and protective services concern, if Mr. Jacobs first could examine Borg-Warner's books.    Mr. Jacobs has written two letters to Borg-Warner indicating his willingness to acquire the company, but a Borg-Warner spokeswoman said, &quot;We do not consider letters from Mr. Jacobs as formal offers or legally binding.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
