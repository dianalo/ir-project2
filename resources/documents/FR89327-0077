In the previous remandinvestigation the Department conducted a survey of Bass' gas customersand concluded that there was no basis for certification.In this reconsideration, the Department's survey obtained additional andcorrected information from a major gas customer which accounted for a majorshare of Bass' sales decline of gas in 1985 compared to 1984. The correctedinformation showed that customers accounting for a major share of Bass'1985 sales decline of gas had increased import purchases of gas in 1985compared to 1984.Worker separation began in 1985. Production worker employment decreasedin 1986 compared to 1985. Company sales and production of gas decreasedin quantity and value in 1985 and in 1986.The Department's certification is based on its standard policy of lookingat quantity especially in regards to the decreased sales or productionand increased import crtieria of the Group Eligibility Requirements ofthe Trade Act. The Department's investigation evaluated natural gas production,sales and import data in quantity.An inquiry was made into the allegations of bias and none was found; althoughsome inadvertent miscommunication and misunderstanding between the petitionerand staff may have occurred.<ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusion</ITAG>After careful review of the additional facts obtained on remand, it isconcluded that increased imports of gas like or directly competitive withthe gas produced at Fort Worth, Texas contributed importantly to workerseparations and to decline in production and employment at Bass EnterprisesProduction Company, Fort Worth, Texas.
