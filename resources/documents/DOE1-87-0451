We analyze the successive decay of the scalar leptoninto three leptons and the lightest neutralino, which is mediated bya heavier neutralino. If the magnitude of CP violation is not small,T odd asymmetry will be observed in the angular distribution of the threeleptons. 6 refs., 6 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
