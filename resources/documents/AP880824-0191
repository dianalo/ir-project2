The current top ticket price on Broadway is $50, the going ratefor such musical hits as ``The Phantom of the Opera,'' ``LesMiserables,'' ``Cats,'' ``Me and My Girl'' and ``Into the Woods.''   By any standards, ``Jerome Robbins' Broadway Dances,' whichbegins preview performances at the Imperial Theater Jan. 16 andofficially opens Feb. 26, is a mammoth undertaking.   Schoenfeld said the musical has a cast of 60 and is expected toinclude production numbers from such Robbins' shows as ``Fiddler onthe Roof,'' ``West Side Story,'' ``Gypsy,'' ``On the Town,''``Peter Pan,'' ``The King and I,'' and ``High Button Shoes.'' Insome of the shows, he was the choreographer and in others he wasboth director and choreographer.   Adding to the cost is the musical's unusually long rehearsalperiod of 22 weeks, compared with six to eight weeks for mostmusicals. ``Broadway Dances,'' which features a cast of relativeunknowns, began rehearsals Aug. 15.   In addition, Schoenfeld said, it took Robbins six months toresearch and reconstruct the dance numbers, interviewing many ofthe original performers in his shows as well as watching videotapesof the original productions.   Schoenfeld said the show would need to gross $420,000 a week tobreak even, and would need to play more than 60 weeks at capacityto pay back its $7 million investment.   Although the show would be the first regular Broadway productionto crack the $50-a-ticket barrier, the limited-run, eight-hourproduction of ``Nicholas Nickleby'' cost $100 a ticket.</TEXT></DOC>
