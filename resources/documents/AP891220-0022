Manuel Antonio Noriega.   The Panamanian leader had said Friday that Panama was in a``state of war'' with the United States and the following day aU.S. Marine lieutenant was killed by Panamanians in what Americanofficials called an unprovoked attack.   U.S. troops in Panama have been on maximum alert since and onMonday a U.S. military officer wounded a Panamanian police officerin what he said was self-defense.   An Associated Press reporter saw 24 U.S. tanks and at least fourtrucks carrying American troops head in the direction of PanamanianDefense Forces headquarters on Tuesday night. Troops in oliveuniforms ran through the luxury Marriott Hotel and lights in thehotel went out.   Channel 8, television station of the U.S. Southern Command,issued an Echo level alert, its highest, and said movement byunauthorized U.S. personnel was prohibited.   The roar of planes and helicopters were heard over the city.   Earlier Tuesday, Panama accused the U.S. forces of violating itsair space with ``observation planes and helicopters'' inpreparation for military action.   Frequent movements of U.S. soldiers and equipment have been seenwithin U.S. military installations the past three days, andappeared to escalate Tuesday at Howard Air Force Base. About 12,000American soldiers are stationed along the Panama Canal.   The United States has tried to oust Noriega, who controls thePanamanian military and the country, since he was indicted onfederal drug trafficking charges in February 1988.   U.S. sanctions have depressed the economy, but have not budgedNoriega, and two coup attempts _ most recently in October _ failedto unseat him.   An NBC News broadcast Tuesday showed what it said were C-141Starlifter transport planes landing in Panama in the afternoon. Itsaid one plane was landing every 10 minutes and that security hadbeen tightened around the air base.   Later Tuesday, a New York Times reporter and a Reuters reporterwere detained for about an hour by U.S. military police when theytried to enter Howard air base to determine whether U.S. forceswere landing.   The Times reporter's notebooks were confiscated by the U.S.Army, the Times said in New York, and the two reporters werereleased without incident.   An AP reporter who drove through Howard air base Tuesday nightsaw at least 10 large transport planes, an unusually high number.There also were six to eight helicopters parked there, in contrastto the usual three or four.   It was not clear what kind of planes they were or whether theytransported troops or cargo.   A U.S. Southern Command spokesman said earlier Tuesday ``nounusual military activity'' was taking place. Later he said he knewnothing about the reported arrival of C-141 planes.   At Fort Clayton, headquarters of the U.S. Army South, tanks werepulled into a circle in an open area and troops climbed on and offthem in routine cleaning and exercises Tuesday afternoon.   Trucks and armored personnel carriers also were moved intopublic view.   Telephone lines to the Southern Command offices at QuarryHeights and to officers' homes were busy late Tuesday. Access toQuarry Heights is limited, but a public road goes through Howard.   Earlier Tuesday, C-141 planes were seen in the air around FortBragg, N.C., home of the Army's 82nd Airborne division. It was notknown if they were connected to any U.S. military activity inPanama.   Fort Bragg spokesmen would say only that Army units there weretaking part in a routine ``emergency deployment readinessexercise.'' Sgt. Bobby Feibel, a spokesman for the division, saidhe had no information on reports that some of the division had leftFort Bragg.   In California, soldiers of the 7th Infantry Division (Light)were mobilized Monday at Fort Ord Army base, also for a readinessexercise, said base public affairs officer Jim Davis.   ``As a matter of policy, we do not address destination, unitsize, unit designation, or times of departure,'' Davis added.   Lt. Pascual Gonzalez, director of civil aviation, said Panamahas ``a critical situation'' with the United States. ``We think thelevel of aggression and intimidation will increase,'' he told TheAssociated Press.   ``There are helicopters flying during the night over ourinstallations,'' he said.   At the State Department in Washington, spokeswoman MargaretTutwiler said Noriega's declaration last week that a state of warexisted with the United States, followed by ``indiscriminate andunprovoked violence against Americans, clearly increases tensionsin Panma.''   Ms. Tutwiler would not say what contingencies or options wereunder consideration.   Panamanian officials say the American officer was killed when heand three others drove a car past checkpoints, then fired atNoriega's military headquarters building, wounding two civiliansand a soldier.   The United States says the four were unarmed, in civilianclothes, when they got lost near the headquarters.   Lt. Robert Paz, 25, who had been in Panama since September, waskilled when the group fled civilians and soldiers who tried toforce them from their car at the checkpoint, Southern Command said.   On Monday, a U.S. Army officer wounded a Panamanian policecorporal because he thought the man was about to draw a weapon,according to Southern Command.   Police Cpl. Cesar Tejada, who was shot once in the left arm,told journalists permitted to interview him in a hospital Tuesdaythe American had initiated the incident.   ``I was merely standing there, doing my job, when this car wentby at high speed and the driver fired two shots at me,'' he said.``I never gave him a reason for it.''   Journalists also were permitted to interview another patient,Alex Correa, who said he belonged to the security detail atmilitary headquarters. Correa said he was shot in the arm Saturdayby the Americans.   Southern Command officials have said repeatedly the onlyshooting was by Panamanian troops.   Noriega has denied the drug charges.</TEXT></DOC>
