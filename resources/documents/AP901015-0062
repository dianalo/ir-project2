The justices, without comment, let stand Nathaniel Johnson Jr.'sconviction, dishonorable military discharge and six-year prisonsentence.   Johnson was stationed at McChord Air Force Base in Washingtonstate when in 1987 he tested positive for the humanimmunodeficiency virus (HIV), which is believed to cause acquiredimmune deficiency syndrome, or AIDS.   AIDS is a contagious disease that attacks the body's immunesystem, rendering it incapable of resisting other diseases andinfections. No one is known to have recovered from AIDS.   A person who, like Johnson, tests positive for HIV has a 20 to30 percent change of developing AIDS over a five-year period,according to the federal Centers for Disease Control.   Johnson was sent to the Wilford Hall Medical Center at LacklandAir Force Base in Texas for evaluation and treatment, and whilethere received counseling on ``safe sex'' practices.   Johnson remained a patient at Wilford Hall until October 1987,about two weeks after the Air Force adopted a policy that held outthe possibility of disciplinary action for HIV-infected militarymembers who did not practice safe sex.   Lawyers for Johnson say he never was told about the policy.   After returning to McChord, Johnson engaged in homosexualconduct with a 17-year-old boy he had met in a Tacoma bar.   The two kissed, and Johnson performed fellatio on the youth. Amilitary judge also found that Johnson had attempted to have analintercourse with the youth. Johnson did not tell the boy about hisHIV infection.   Tried by general court-martial at McChord in early 1988, Johnsonwas convicted of consensual sodomy by fellatio. He also wasconvicted of aggravated assault and attempted sodomy, both premisedon the act of attempted consensual anal intercourse. He wassentenced to 10 years in prison.   The U.S. Air Force Court of Military Review threw out theattempted consenual sodomy conviction after ruling that the chargeessentially duplicated the aggravated assault charge.   The court reduced Johnson's sentence to six years, and itsruling was upheld by the U.S. Court of Military Appeals last April.   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for Johnson said theportion of the Uniform Code of Military Justice used to prosecutehim for aggravated assault is impermissibly vague when applied tothe possible transmission of a virus.   They said the offense of aggravated assault never was intendedto be used against someone accused of transmitting a contagiousdisease unless there is a clear intent to spread the disease.   The appeal added: ``Our society is clearly inflamed withhysteria over the HIV epidemic ... We cannot allow our legal systemto be improperly used as a tool for the further prosecution of HIVcarriers.''   The case is Johnson vs. U.S., 90-61.</TEXT></DOC>
