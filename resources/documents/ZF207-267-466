 -- Apple is trying to break into the fast-growingcommercial systems integration service industry by developing demonstrationMacintosh solutions in three key areas: storage and retrieval of informationon CD-ROM, executive information systems and sales automation.andM;Apple is developing the integrated packages at the request of corporatecustomers and is using Apple and third-party products, according to MichaelSzabados, manager of sales and marketing for Apple Integrated Systems (AIS),the group in charge of the development.andM;But the systems, some of which will be ready by year's end, are also meant toimpress the usefulness of the Mac on systems integrators that Apple has beencourting.andM;The company recently formed partnerships with three companies: EDS of Dallas,a $ 4.8 billion computer services giant that is now a subsidairy of GeneralMotors; Systems House Inc. of Arlington, Va.; and Big Eight accounting firmPeat Marwick Main andamp; Co., which wants to leverage its Macintosh expertise.andM;The 100-person AIS team, formed in earnest last September after months ofpreliminary exploration, is viewed by Apple as a key component of itsbusiness strategy in the next decade , according to the company.andM;&quot;All we need to do is develop a few real solutions and two or three successesto prove to a company like EDS that [adopting the Macintosh] is somethingthey should do,&quot; Szabados said.andM;Document management.andP;  Document management is one such Macintosh solution.andP;  Inthe not-so-distant future airline mechanics will search a Macintosh CD-ROMdatabase for repair instructions and parts descriptions instead of poringover hard-to-manage microfilm, Szabados said.andP;  Apple recently showed aprototype of its system to American Airlines, according to Jim Johnson,customer service manager of Maxwell Data Management Inc., a Costa Mesa,Calif.-based integrator and developer.andP;  Maxwell has been collaborating withApple on the project.andM;AIS is developing a prototype of the document management system primarilywith third-party products and plans to leave vertical market applicationdevelopment to companies such as Maxwell, as sales in a particular niche areaare likely to be small.andP;  Even if a giant such as American Airlines specifiesthe Mac as the platform of choise -- something it has not yet done -- Applewould sell no more thna 500 to 700 Macs, Johnson said.andM;Amercian Airlines, which also reportedly been testing an IBM PC-baseddocument-management system, did not return calls about the status of theApple deal.andM;Apple also plans to target other industries for the system, primarily those,such as the pharmaceutical industry, that are heavily regulated by thefederal government, Szabados said.andP;  &quot;It takes five to seven years to push adrug through the review process,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;A company has to submit data forreview.andP;  If you put it all in an electronic format you could reduce thatcycle quite a bit.&quot;andM;Apple is focusing on improving the preparation of data for inclusion on aCD-ROM rather than retrieval, which Szabados called relatively easy.andM;Executive information systems.andP;  Apple is also working with systemsintegrators to develop executive information systems (EIS).andP;  The idea is tobring information from various sources onto an executive's desk in aneasy-to-understand format.andP;  EIS packages automatically draw the executive'sattention to important reports, highlighting items such as a project that'sover budget.andM;Because they are targeted at upper management, such systems will not sellmany Macs directly, Szabados said.andP;  &quot;But if you get to 30 executives, youwon't have trouble getting them to approve the next order of computers.&quot;andM;Three major vendors of development shells for EIS -- Austin, Texas-basedExecucom systems Corp., Pilot Executive Software of Boston and Comshare Inc.andO;of Ann Arbor, Mich.--are considering the Macintosh as a platform for theirsoftware, MacWEEK has learned.andM;As these vendors put an emphasis on graphical intefaces, the Macintosh os anatural path for them to take, according to Allan Frank, senior manager atPeat Marwick's Philadelphia office and developer of EIS programs for thecompany.andM;EIS software typically includes a mainframe database as well ascommunications and financial modeling software.andP;  The development systems cancost up to $300,000.andM;Some corporations that have been developing EIS on their own with HyperCardas a front end, including GTE Corp. and Home Box Office (see MacWEEK, July19, 1988), said they are not interested in purchasing such products.andM;&quot;We looked into Pilot a few years back,&quot; said Robert Martin, director ofnetwork programming services at HBO in New York, &quot;but the amount of money itwanted was astronomical, and we were'nt confident that our data was strongenough to make that expense worthwhile.&quot;andM;Sales support.andP;  The last part of Szabados' vision is full of salesrepresentatives outfitted with Macintosh laptops displaying the latestinformation about their companies' products.andP;  &quot;Productivity of the salesforce appears to be the concern of all our corporate customers,&quot; he said.andO;&quot;and if sales reps sell drugs to doctors with the Mac they carry with themunder their arm, they will also sell the Mac.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
