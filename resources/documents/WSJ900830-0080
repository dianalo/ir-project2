Major media companies staked out their piece of turf yearsago with such mainstays as Los Angeles, owned by CapitalCities/ABC Inc., and American Express Publishing Co.'s L.A.Style. But now a plucky group of independent magazines --some new, some revamped -- have set sights on the city, withan editorial focus as narrow as a single neighborhood or asbroad as the California state of mind.</LP><TEXT>   BUZZ, a monthly magazine aiming to be hip, literary andupscale all at once, will make its debut in early October.The Brentwood Bla-Bla, one of two quirky monthlies thatpublish solely what readers send in, is stepping up itsdistribution in the area since being acquired last month byPage Group Publishing Inc. Exposure, a funky pop-culturemonthly bought recently by Capital Cities/ABC, will soon geta cleaner look and national distribution.   But Los Angeles already may have reached a saturationpoint in local magazines. The new flurry of publications willtest the limits of the local advertising market and couldoverwhelm readers. Through July of this year, a half-dozenCalifornia city magazines, ranging from Palm Springs Life toSan Francisco Focus to the granddaddy, Los Angeles, have beenhit with ad-page losses, according to Media IndustryNewsletter.   Publishers worry that planned cuts in defense spendingcould push the region into a recession and make things eventougher for the magazines. Los Angeles's sprawling, divergenturban mass has prevented existing magazines from buildingmassive circulation, yet starting a new city magazine herecan cost $5 million to $10 million, as much as it takes tolaunch a small national magazine. Another hurdle: Tonynational magazines lured by the city's image are moving in onthe locals' domain.   Industry executives say Los Angeles publishers need onlylook east to see the pitfalls of a crowded market. In the NewYork area, a local recession and bad times in retailing havedepressed ad spending, resulting in the shutdown of a fewmagazines -- Seven Days and Manhattan inc. among them -- andfalling ad pages at many. American Express's New York Woman,though critically praised, is down 23% in ad pages throughJune, and even News Corp.'s perennially healthy New Yorkmagazine is down 14%.   &quot;The lesson of New York is very clear,&quot; says Thomas Ryder,president of American Express Publishing Corp., which boughtL.A. Style in 1988. &quot;If you have too many magazines in onecity, you will see a bloodbath and people will losemillions.&quot;   Moreover, in virtually every part of the country, city andregional magazines are being hit hard by declining retailadvertising. But publishers such as BUZZ President EdenCollinsworth say Los Angeles is &quot;underserved&quot; by magazinesand that the publications can share the wealth by appealingto distinctly different audiences.   The market could quickly become overserved, however,because virtually every existing magazine and most of the newand revamped independents have the same target: the WestSide, comprising the largely affluent, yuppified communitiesof Malibu, Santa Monica, Beverly Hills, Brentwood and BelAir.   &quot;BUZZ wants to attract a highly creative, artisticaudience -- but so do many publications,&quot; says W. PendletonTudor, chairman of the executive committee of A/S/MCommunications, Inc., which publishes Adweek.   Despite the lessons of New York, magazine executives sayLos Angeles is a city headed in another direction, and theywant to catch the momentum. &quot;The center of gravity isshifting in the country,&quot; says BUZZ's Ms. Collinsworth. &quot;LosAngeles has become a terrifically confident metropolitancenter, and there's room for a new magazine that reflects thenew reality.&quot;   No longer the second or third city to New York, LosAngeles can now boast of being the country's top retail salesmarket and the fastest-growing major city. The Getty Museumand industrialist Armand Hammer are both building museumshere. Earlier this year, the Los Angeles Times, flagshippaper of Times Mirror Co., passed the New York Daily News asthe country's largest metropolitan daily. And themuch-thumbed-through Zagat Restaurant Survey has declaredthat Los Angeles has bypassed New York in serving the world'smost imaginative restaurant food.   Though no one magazine has dominated, Los Angeles is themost established, with paid circulation of more than 170,000.Started in 1960, it took 13 years to become profitable. Withreaders heavily concentrated on the affluent West Side andscattered through assorted valleys, it continues to strugglewith the urban sprawl that is modern-day Los Angeles.   &quot;Communities have developed their own urban identities;they don't look to downtown L.A. as the center,&quot; says GeoffMiller, publisher of Los Angeles. &quot;That makes it hard to findthe shared values that create a loyal readership.&quot;   Los Angeles takes the broadest, middle-of-the-roadapproach. It used the innocuous TV star Bob Newhart on thecover of its recent dining guide issue. (Exposure, bycontrast, preferred for a recent cover a jarring photo of arock singer from the band Jane's Addiction; he wore a ringthrough both nostrils and had been spray-painted platinum.)   Los Angeles offers a foolproof mix of upbeat servicearticles on restaurants and real estate, and some, but notmuch, serious journalism. It is the biggest monthly citymagazine in the country, but circulation is flat and hasn'tgrown much since tripling in the 1970s to 150,000.   The magazine's mainstream approach has left room forothers. BUZZ, whose tag line is &quot;The Talk of Los Angeles,&quot;hopes to draw a more affluent, in-the-know readership with amore literary publication.   Stationed in a classic '50s-modern house designed by LosAngeles architect Richard Neutra high atop Mulholland Drive,Ms. Collinsworth and a small staff have assembled a troop of&quot;name&quot; writers whose Hollywood connections make themcelebrities in their own right. Columnists includescreenwriter Harlan Ellison and Holly Palance (daughter ofactor Jack Palance). BUZZ has already drawn ad commitmentsfrom national advertisers such as Absolut, Guess? jeans, andEstee Lauder.   For something farther out on the edge, there is Exposure,a three-year-old monthly acquired in January by the FairchildPublications unit of Capital Cities/ABC. It started as astreetwise nightclub magazine for the hip Melrose area andbecame ever slicker, monitoring popular culture and focusingon fashion while also running stories on racism, censorshipand other social issues. As part of its push for Exposure,Fairchild will sell ad space in the magazine in a packagewith the company's fashion publications.   Other magazines are targeting other geographic orspecial-interest niches. L.A. Style, largely a fashionmagazine, will clear a profit this year for the first time inits five-year run. Angeles magazine, focusing on interiordesign, is distributed free to affluent neighborhoods. L.A.West focuses on travel, local environmental issues, and homeand garden, and is distributed free to homes on the WestSide.   The most offbeat magazines are two written by readers: theBrentwood Bla-Bla and Beverly Hills, the Magazine. Both wereacquired in July by Page Group Publishing. Readers send inpoems, reminiscences, restaurant reviews, weddingphotographs. But the contributors are getting more famous.Photographer Scavullo recently contributed shots of famouscelebrities to Beverly Hills.   Despite the local crowd, several New York-based magazines,most notably Vanity Fair, have targeted Los Angeles asfertile ground to build circulation. G. Douglas Johnston,publisher of the Conde Nast Publications Inc. property, saysLos Angeles provides 13% of Vanity Fair's nationalcirculation of 750,000, not far behind the 16% sold in NewYork.   But others are pulling back. Bud Knapp, chairman of LosAngeles-based Knapp Communications Corp., recently killedplans for a weekly regional magazine in Los Angeles. Mr.Knapp, publisher of Architectural Digest and Bon Appetit,says the publication was dropped because of the high costs ofstart-up and &quot;the state of our economy, now and projectingforward.&quot; He adds: &quot;Like everything in life, starting a newmagazine is a matter of good timing.&quot;   ---                Los Angeles Magazines Multiply                                                                                                                                                        TOTAL TITLES                                    CIRCULATION                                                                                                        Los Angeles                                 172,123 Brentwood Bla Bla and Beverly Hills, The Magazine                 140,000* Angeles                                      95,826* L.A.
