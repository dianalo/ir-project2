Average precipitation pHfrom field measurements during 1979-1983 declined from west to east from4.8, 4.6, and 4.3 along a cross section of sites in Minnesota, Wisconsin,and Michigan respectively where 990 lake and stream sampling sites werestudied. Measurements of weakly buffered lakes show a parallel declinein lake water pH with the lowest values measured, 5.1, 4.6 and 4.4, respectivelyin the same regions. Correspondingly, the percentage of lakes sampledwith little or no acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) was found to increasefrom 0 to 4 and 13 percent, respectively. The geographic patterns inionic composition of airborne acids and bases, and the resultant surfacewater concentrations are compared. The differences in AFC of airborneinputs from west to east, and differences in in-lake processes explainthe observed acidity of weakly buffered lakes across the region.</TEXT></DOC>
