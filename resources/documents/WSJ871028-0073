In a statement, the agency yesterday said it will continue to allow bidding for failed banks by federally assisted banks that have &quot;substantial&quot; private sector capital. What amounts to &quot;substantial&quot; will be decided on a case-by-case basis, the agency said.    The FDIC said that, normally, it will bar bids from federally aided banks that have little private capital and &quot;significant&quot; continuing control by the FDIC. But it said even such banks will be allowed to bid if a first round of bidding doesn't produce any acceptable offers.    According to a spokesman, FDIC Chairman William Seidman believes that, generally, banks aided by federal agencies should be able to compete and regain viability like any other private institution. But he doesn't want the agency itself, in effect, competing with private banks.    Also yesterday, the FDIC repealed a ban against banks sharing a common name, logo or entrance with securities subsidiaries or affiliates. And it approved a rule allowing small banks that lend heavily to farmers to take seven years to write off farm loan losses rather than writing them off immediately.    Acquisitions by federally assisted banks have provoked objections since last year's acquisition by Continental Illinois Corp. of three suburban Chicago banks. Continental Illinois was itself the recipient of $4.5 billion in federal financing in a 1984 bailout.    The FDIC's statement yesterday was intended to clarify its position. But it deliberately left vague whether Continental Illinois would, under these guidelines, be barred from bidding on failed banks. An agency spokesman said more than 50% of Continental Illinois is still owned by federal authorities.    Last summer, the FDIC allowed the Bank of Oklahoma in Oklahoma City to successfully bid on the FDIC-assisted sales of First National Bank, Yukon, Okla. and American Exchange Bank andamp; Trust Co., Norman, Okla. The transactions came only a year after the Bank of Oklahoma obtained $130 million in aid from federal agencies to prevent its own failure.    Many Oklahoma bankers &quot;saw that as their federal deposit insurance premiums being used to compete against them in acquisition of failed banks,&quot; said Robert Harris, executive vice president of the Oklahoma Bankers Association.    Diane Casey, a spokeswoman for the Independent Bankers Association of America, which represents small banks, said federally aided banks should be barred from acquiring healthy or failed banks. &quot;They've already had problems, now they're going to pick up more problems,&quot; she said.    The Oklahoma bankers group requested the clarification of the FDIC's position.    The restriction against banks and securities affiliates sharing an entrance, logo or name was adopted in 1984, but enforcement was repeatedly delayed.    Although the restriction was repealed, a rule approved yesterday preserves a requirement that banks and securities affiliates physically segregate their offices. The rule left the definition of &quot;segregation&quot; vague. It added a requirement that the affiliate disclose that the bank isn't responsible for obligations of the securities business and that the FDIC doesn't insure it.    Approval of lenient accounting for certain farm loan losses fulfills a provision in a banking law enacted this year and is being duplicated by the Federal Reserve and the Comptroller of the Currency. The rule applies to banks that have less than $100 million in assets and have made more than 25% of their loans to farmers.    Some FDIC members protested the change, but Mr. Seidman said that, with farm economics improving, &quot;we probably won't see it used very much.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
