(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Republican presidential hopeful PatRobertson said today that charges of Jimmy Swaggart's sexualmisconduct had been known for a few months, but somebody plannedthe scandal to embarrass him before the Super Tuesday elections.   Swaggart, a television evangelist accused of sexual misconduct,was ordered Monday by the hierarchy of his church in Baton Rouge,La., to limit his preaching and enter counseling.   Robertson, who bristles at the label of former televisionevangelist, said today that evidence showing that Swaggart had beeninvolved with prostitutes had ``lied dormant since last October.''   It ``stretches the imagination and stretches credulity'' that itcame two weeks ``before the most important primary in the nation,''the Republican candidate said during a news conference in Columbia.A round of primaries and caucuses will be held Super Tuesday, March8, in 20 states.   ``Nothing happens to people by accident,'' Robertson said in aninterview Monday with the Anderson, S.C., Independent-Mail. ``It iskind of funny this came up two weeks before the most importantprimaries in the nation. People probably wonder what went on.   ``I think somebody had something to do with it,'' saidRobertson. ``Somebody else planned all these things, I am afraid.''   Asked again today whether he had any evidence to show that thescandal broke just before Super Tuesday, Robertson replied: ``Ihave no knowledge. It's certainly a coincidence.''   On Monday, Robertson offered no proof of his contention, anddeclined to say to whom he was referring. However, in the sameinterview he accused the campaign of Vice President George Bush of``dirty politics'' and ``trickery'' directed at him.   A Bush campaign official, asked about the remarks, saidRobertson had apparently adopted a new campaign strategy of``making bizarre statements in order to make news.''   ``To suggest that we had something to do with (the Swaggartaffair) borders on the outlandish,'' said Jay Morgan, Bush's deputySouthern political director, in a telephone interview from his homein Atlanta.   Robertson repeated his charge today that the Bush campaign plans``dirty tricks'' in South Carolina, saying he was told that thevice president's campaign plans to run some television ads``dealing with religious bigotry in the few days before the (SouthCarolina primary) elections.''   Bush campaign ad director Sid Rogich said today the only adrunning in South Carolina is a biographical commercial.   Two weeks ago, Robertson scolded NBC anchor Tom Brokaw, whointerviewed him live on the night of the Iowa caucuses, forreferring to him as a former television evangelist.   Robertson, who founded the Christian Broadcasting Network andfor years hosted its flagship program ``The 700 Club,'' says hewants to be described as a former religious broadcaster, or atelevision businessman.   Earlier Monday, Robertson had said Swaggart's troubles were``unfortunate,'' but had nothing to do with him.   He said the Swaggart case will have ``no more effect on me thanGary Hart'' had on other candidates, referring to Hart's problemsfollowing reports of his relationship with a Miami model. Hartdropped out of the presidential race in May but rejoined it inDecember.   ``It (the Swaggart controversy) will not affect me because ithas nothing whatsoever to do with me,'' Robertson told the Andersonnewspaper. ``But I want to tell people to ask George Bush what hethinks about all this.   ``I have been told of Bush's dirty tricks and I expect to seethem in South Carolina,'' he said. ``His campaign will use everykind of dirty trick against me because this state is important andI have a lot of support and George Bush knows that.''   South Carolina holds its primary March 5, three days before 20states, mainly in the South, hold primaries and caucuses.</TEXT></DOC>
