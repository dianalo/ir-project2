Beingoverwhelmed is the status quo for most of California's public facilities.;  Schools are overwhelmed by new students, hospitals by uninsured sick people,highways by more drivers, prisons by more inmates.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  OVERLY OVERWHELMEDSMALL FEES TO USE PARKS ARE FINE, BUT THEY'REAPPROACHING THE LIMIT  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Editorials  </MEMO><TEXT>     As Mercury News Staff Writer Lisa Lapin reported recently, parks haven'tbeen exempt from the state's population pressures and budget woes.;  Campgrounds are crowded, maintenance has been put off to another day and a fewparks may be abandoned.;   In one sense, the state's parks have kept up withpopulation. Thanks to bond issues, some sponsored by environmental groups, thestate has been able to buy more park land. In 1960 there were 15.7 millionpeople in the state and 650,000 acres of parks. In 1990, there were almosttwice as many people, 29.7 million, and twice as many acres of parks, 1.3million.;   But 1990s people go to the parks more than '60s people did. Theparks now average 60 visitors per acre; in 1960 they averaged 35. As visits toparks increased, the Legislature whittled away the state's contribution toparks, and asked park users to make up the difference.;   Fees and concessionswere less than one-tenth of the budget in 1980. They are 57 percent of thecurrent budget.;   Small fees are fine. Users of parks should pay more thantaxpayers generally. Fees are approaching their limit, however. A night at onebeach campground rivals the cost at Motel 6. One reason for public parks is toprovide recreation for people who can't afford private resorts.;   Some parkproblems stem from the lack of strong leadership in the Department of Parksand Recreation. Turnover among directors has been high.;   For the most part,though, the parks mirror the problems of public agencies in California: lotsof people wanting to use them, and a source of money that isn't keeping pace.  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910906  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  6B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  316  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday, September 6, 199100250230,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
