The telephone utility, which made the disclosure in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, denied the allegations.    &quot;We have stated in the past and continue to state that Cincinnati Bell Telephone Co. has never ordered anyone to participate in an illegal wiretap,&quot; a company spokesman said. &quot;The allegations are not true and we intend to defend ourselves vigorously.&quot;    The suits, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, stem from claims by two fired Cincinnati Bell employees, who told local newspapers that they had been ordered to illegally tap the telephone lines of more than 1,000 Cincinnati area residents. The only reason the former employees reportedly gave for tapping the phones was for national security concerns. Three of the residents, whose lines were allegedly tapped, filed the suits.    Sources said a federal grand jury also is investigating the alleged wiretaps.    The company said it hadn't yet been served with any summons. The plaintiffs are seeking a total of $12 million in compensatory damages and $100 million in punitive damages, according to Cincinnati Bell. </TEXT></DOC>
