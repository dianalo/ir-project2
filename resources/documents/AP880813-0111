Mantell, chief psychologist for the San Diego Police Department.He was attending the annual meeting of the American PsychologicalAssociation.   ``Stop telling yourself it's awful. It's just hot,'' Mantellsaid. ``At the very worst, it's an inconvenience.''   ``It is very comforting to think and to realize that it could beworse,'' he said.   Though rainfall eased drought conditions in parts of theMidwest, much of the nation continued to swelter Saturday, andpower consumption and temperature records fell.   ``This is like Brazil,'' said Mel Goldstein, director of theweather center at Western Connecticut State University in Danbury.``It's tropical weather, with high heat and the water vapor justabsolutely saturating the atmosphere.''   The temperature reached 90 degrees shortly after noon Saturdayin Windsor Locks, Conn. It was the 12th day of the month withtemperatures at 90 or above, breaking the August record of 11 dayswith more than half the month still to go.   In New York City, Saturday was the 30th straight day withtemperatures in the 90s. Consolidated Edison said electricity useset a record Friday, while in Boston, heat-related power outagesaffected more than 6,000 customers.   Temperatures in that range may have an effect on the safety of atop summer pastime. A study released at the meeting Saturdaysuggests baseball batters get beaned by pitches more often when thetemperature is in the 90s, maybe because the heat is makingpitchers more aggressive.   It's not so much that the beanballs are deliberate, but ratherthe pitchers may be trying to move batters back from the plate,prodded by discomfort from the heat, said researcher Alan Reifman.   ``You might plan to throw it close, and your aim is a littleoff,'' he said.   He and colleagues found that in 21 games analyzed for which thetemperature was in the 90s, pitchers racked up an average of 0.57hit batters per game. For the remainder of the total 215 games inthe study, the highest average for cooler weather was 0.33, forgames played in the 80s. Lower rates were found for games at lowertemperatures.   Mantell suggested that one strategy for coping with the heat isto spend some time alone and take an occasional break from life'sstresses.   ``During a heat wave you don't want to be a workaholic,'' hesaid.   ``Your thinking can be an internal thermometer to lower thetemperature to what it is outside, instead of what you'veexaggerated it to,'' he said.   Parents should distract their children from focusing on theheat, and they should model a cool mental attitude for the childrento see, he said.   A good line of approach is, ``Boy, it sure is hot, it sure isuncomfortable, but it will pass. ... I can tolerate it,'' Mantellsaid.   James Rotton, a psychologist at Florida International Universityin North Miami, recommended drinking plenty of water rather thanalcohol. Alcohol tends to unleash aggression in hot weather, hesaid.   Studies have given strong evidence that hot weather promotesassaults between acquaintances, homicides and rape, he said in atelephone interview.   Humidity amplifies the effect of heat, but the main problem isthat the body can't shed its own heat when the air is so warm, hesaid.   To cope with heat, as with any stress, Rotton recommendedstaying in good physical shape. But don't overdo the exercise inhot weather, he added.   Drinking water is important because during hot weather the bodyloses water faster than people can detect through thirst, he said.The result can be heat stroke.</TEXT></DOC>
