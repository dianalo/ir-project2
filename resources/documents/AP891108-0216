In another development, U.S. Rep. John Rowland, a Republican whoplans to run for governor, called on Gov. William A. O'Neill toabandon a state investigation of the matter, and cooperate fullywith a parallel probe by the FBI.   Attorney Hugh Keefe questioned Trooper Chris Garrity, whoinadvertently revealed the policy's existence last month, and saidhe would subpoena higher-ranking officials until the policy isexplained.   ``We're going right up the line,'' said the New Haven attorney.``If we don't get adequate answers, satisfactory answers, we'll goto the top.''   The policy of taping calls into and out of state policebarracks, including calls made by suspects to their lawyers, wasdescribed in The Hartford Courant on Tuesday. O'Neill ordered animmediate end to the practice and launched the state investigation.   The Courant's story sent shock waves through courthouses acrossthe state. Outraged defense attorneys predicted that scores ofcriminal cases would be affected and that state officials couldface heavy penalties if it's found they violated state or federalwiretapping laws.   Rep. Rowland said in a statement issued by his office inWashington that the state probe of ``this sorry situation'' shouldbe dropped because it would lack credibility in the eyes of thepublic.   Asked for a response to Rowland's statement, O'Neill spokesmanJon Sandberg said, ``The governor has made his position perfectlyclear. He is not in the business of responding to othergubernatorial candidates.''   O'Neill earlier said he was anxious to talk to Public SafetyCommissioner Lester J. Forst, who as state police commander isresponsible for the policy. Forst is on a hunting trip in Alaska.   In Hartford, the governor said he had no plans to fire Forst,but said, ``All commissioners serve at my pleasure. We're allreplaceable, it's just a question of when.''   In Waterbury, Garrity testified in the trial of Waterbury policedetective Robert Little on drunken-driving and manslaughter charges.   Garrity said he originally thought all phone calls from policebarracks were taped, but now is not sure what the policy is.   ``If you believe these troopers, they don't know the extent ofthe system,'' said Keefe.   During a pretrial hearing Oct. 24, Garrity mentioned thepractice of taping all phone calls from state police barracks,including calls Little made to his attorney the night he wasarrested.   In subsequent testimony, Garrity backed off from his originaldescription of the policy. He has said calls are randomly selectedto be taped, but has also said he's not sure which calls are taped.   Sgt. Richard Sealander, a state police spokesman, lent credenceto Garrity's initial description when he confirmed in the Courant'sstory that a policy exists of recording calls from barracks,including calls by suspects.   Keefe on Wednesday asked Garrity, ``If Sergeant Sealander saidthat every conversation were taped, would you agree with that?''   Garrity replied, ``If that's what he said, yes I would.''</TEXT></DOC>
