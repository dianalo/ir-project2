Trinova, which underwent a major corporate restructuring in 1986, had net income of $122.6 million, or $3.22 a share, that year. Estimates for 1987 would imply fourth-quarter net income of 55 cents to 60 cents a share, compared with $9.5 million, or 28 cents a share a year ago.    The 1986 per-share figures are adjusted for last summer's 2-for-1 stock split and reflect a restructuring charge of $9.7 million for the fourth-quarter of 1986.    Trinova's &quot;power and motion control&quot; segment makes hydraulic and electronic systems and parts such as pumps, motors and hoses for industrial equipment and the aerospace and defense industry. Trinova also makes molded plastics for automobile dashboards, interior and exterior trim, and laminates for counter tops.    Trinova was known as Libbey-OwensFord Corp. until mid-1986, when it sold its glass-making operations and underwent restructuring. As a result, Trinova's 1986 earnings contained several unusual items. The 1986 earnings from continuing operations were $36.2 million, or 95 cents a share, including a net provision for a restructuring charge of $30.3 million or 80 cents a share. Net for 1986 included a gain of $86.3 million, or $2.27 a share, from discontinued operations -- primarily from the sale of the glass business.    Darryl F. Allen, president and chief executive officer, said he wouldn't discourage earnings estimates of between $2.50 and $2.60 a share for 1988.    Mr. Allen said a major corporate goal is to improve the return on shareholder equity, which is now 12%, up from 3% in 1982, but below the stated goal of 16%.    He said Trinova is seeking acquisitions in plastics and power and motion controls. Recent acquisitions include the Fraser andamp; Glass unit of Tenby Industries in England, Tennessee-based Kusan Manufacturing Co. and EL.GE Italy, based in Milan. He said Trinova's top priority is to acquire a plastics business in Europe.    Mr. Allen said power and motion control sales continue to increase, with a growing backlog of orders from industrial, aerospace and defense customers. Plastics sales are softer, with new uses for plastic in vehicles helping to offset the lower volume of U.S. car production.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Trinova was unchanged at $31.75 a share. </TEXT></DOC>
