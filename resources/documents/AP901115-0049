(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Firefighters hoped lighter winds andlower temperatures would linger long enough to help them battle a34,000-acre timber and grass fire near the Missouri River.   About two dozen hunters fled their backcountry camps lateTuesday when the wind-whipped fire raged through the remote Gatesof the Mountains Wilderness and adjacent Beartooth Game Range inwestern Montana.   Lorraine Parrish, a spokeswoman at the Interagency DispatchCenter near Helena, said the wind died down unexpectedly Wednesday,and snow was falling on some areas of the fire.   The fire broke out late Tuesday in the rugged Big Belt Mountainsabout 35 miles northeast of Helena. Officials said record-hightemperatures, extremely dry conditions and winds as high as 30 mphhelped the fire spread before the situation improved Wednesday.   Gov. Stan Stephens on Wednesday called out the National Guard tohelp the 400 firefighters and support personnel fight the blaze.   The cause hasn't been pinpointed, but officials think the blazemay have started in a hunting camp.   Lewis and Clark County authorities said all the hunters known tohave been in the area were accounted for, and no injuries had beenreported.   Several hunters at the Elkhorn Creek campsite had no time toleave and spent several hours lying in a creek, waiting for theflames to pass.   Others fled on horseback, leaving behind most of theirbelongings, and spent the night trying to keep ahead of the blaze.``We had a big fire going behind us to lighten things up,'' saidhunter Gary Phillipe. ``That baby, it was like a full moon.''   Butch Hestekin of Great Falls said a wall of flames ``justwhipped across the tops of the trees'' at his hunting camp. In therush to save their lives, Hestekin's hunting party abandoned fivepickups and all their belongings.   ``The cinders were falling on us,'' said Lynn Dumas, anotherhunter. ``We had five minutes' warning - just about enough time tosaddle a horse.''   At least 30 homes were evacuated east of Wolf Creek, and thefire got within about two miles of the small town of Craig, whichis protected by the Missouri River.</TEXT></DOC>
