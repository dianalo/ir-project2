He made the comments in a statement released in advance oftoday's meeting of his political organization, Inkatha.   Buthelezi declined to provide details of the plan. He said itwould be discussed at a meeting of the African National Congress,United Democratic Front and Inkatha. However, he gave no date.   The plan was drafted last month at a meeting in Durban ofdelegates from Inkatha, the front, and the Congress of South AfricanTrade Unions.   Inkatha backers have been battling supporters of an alliance ofthe two other groups for three years in Natal province in feuds andrevenge attacks that have killed about 2,000 people.   In early June, the three groups opened peace talks, and violencehas decreased sharply since then.   The outlawed ANC, the leading anti-apartheid group, is not partof the talks. But its views are represented in them by delegates ofthe front.   The front, the union group and the ANC have in the past calledButhelezi a collaborator with the apartheid system of racialdiscrimination because of his position as chief minister of the Zuluhomeland and his opposition to tactics such as strikes, boycotts,and other sanctions.   He says these measures harm blacks more than the government.Buthelezi, a member of the ANC in his youth, also believes the ANC'sbomb attacks and its claim to be the sole representative of SouthAfrica's blacks have hindered united black action.   However, the Zulu leader said he now has high hopes for anagreement. ``We could well be entering into an era in which blackpolitics is given a completely different face,'' he said.   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregatedsociety in which the 28 million blacks have no vote in nationalaffairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintainseparate districts, schools and health services.</TEXT></DOC>
