In the short term, the administration's action, which involves only a small fraction of Japan's electronics exports to the U.S., is likely to have little if any impact either on the U.S.'s $170 billion trade deficit or on overall Japanese trade practices. Rather, it is primarily a symbolic move intended both to jolt Japan into enforcing the semiconductor accord and to mollify demands in Congress for a tougher U.S. trade stance.    But the administration's action -- the first time in recent years that the U.S. has retaliated in force against Japan in a trade dispute -- shows that Washington's frustrations over the trade issue have finally reached the point where it now is willing to bite, not just bark, if it believes that Japan isn't playing by the rules. Senior administration officials hope that that will cause a major rethinking in Japan.    Although Tokyo has threatened to retaliate against the U.S. move -- and may even file a token complaint in the Geneva-based General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade -- American strategists are counting on the White House announcement to create a &quot;shock wave&quot; in Japan that will spark a serious national debate there over opening the Japanese market to more imports.    The U.S. action also is expected to make policy makers here more willing to retaliate in future disputes, although Washington still is expected to use such weapons sparingly.    U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter, fresh from a round of cabinet meetings on this and other U.S.-Japan trade issues, says the semiconductor action &quot;probably constitutes the first step in a major reassessment of our longer-term economic relationship with the Japanese,&quot; not only on trade but on Japan's overall economic role in the world. Whether or not Mr. Yeutter's forecast comes true, officials here say the president's action is a clear indicator of the intensity of feeling on the issue.    While neither side expects a major trade war, Japan's current economic squeeze, brought on in part by a falloff in exports, is hardening Japanese attitudes toward the U.S. And given Japan's growing economic muscle, any clash between the two nations poses risks to the U.S. as well as to Japan.    For now, however, most analysts both inside and outside the U.S. government say it is too soon to measure just how momentous Friday's announcement will eventually prove.    Some analysts say the administration appears to have been aiming its get-tough message as much at Capitol Hill as at Tokyo: With anti-Japanese fever in Congress soaring recently, both Democrats and Republicans have become increasingly strident in demanding that the administration &quot;go to the mat&quot; with Japan, as it did in imposing 200% tariffs on the Common Market late last year in a dispute over European agricultural barriers. Brussels eventually gave in and the U.S. lifted its penalties before they were scheduled to take effect in January.    Congressional strategists say the new U.S. action isn't likely to have much impact in blocking or even softening the sweeping trade legislation that Congress is drafting. But it could help keep anti-Japanese feelings from boiling over. Most analysts believe that the major effect in Congress would have come if the administration hadn't retaliated against Japan following the breakdown of the semiconductor accord.    &quot;Everyone was complaining that the administration had been too soft on Japan,&quot; a congressional strategist says. &quot;These guys would have gone berserk if the administration had decided not to go ahead.&quot;    What's more, even if the tougher tariffs on Japanese products are imposed as scheduled on April 17, it is likely they will last only a few weeks or a couple of months. Even before the U.S. decided to act, Tokyo had been moving to enforce the accord more vigorously, and might have succeeded given a few more weeks. U.S. officials say they will probably remove the April 17 penalties as soon as Japan comes into compliance. Significantly, neither side has said it wants to abandon the accord.    Yoichi Funabashi, a veteran Japanese political analyst now visiting at the Washington-based Institute for International Economics, predicts that imposition of the new tariffs will bolster Tokyo's hand with errant Japanese microchip producers. &quot;It's still very much part of a game,&quot; Mr. Funabashi asserts.    Japan announced over the weekend that it is rushing Makoto Kuroda, vice minister of trade and industry, to the U.S. for &quot;emergency&quot; consultations on the semiconductor issue. Mr. Kuroda was Japan's chief negotiator for the semiconductor accord. In Tokyo, Japanese Trade Minister Hajime Tamura called the U.S. move &quot;regrettable.&quot;    Ironically, the most immediate political victim of the retaliation effort may be America's biggest friend in the Japanese government, Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone. Mr. Nakasone, who has built his political reputation on his ability to manage relations with the U.S., already is in serious political trouble over domestic issues. &quot;This is going to hurt him for sure,&quot; Mr. Funabashi says. As a result, future prime ministers might be less inclined to accommodate concerns of the U.S. However, Mr. Nakasone might be able to redeem himself with Japanese voters if he can settle the dispute during his scheduled visit to Washington late next month.    The penalties that the White House announced Friday will result in 100% tariffs on some $300 million worth of Japanese imports that either contain Japanese-made semiconductors or are manufactured by the same Japanese firms that make the microchips themselves. The list of potential targets includes hard-disk drives, central processing units for computers, 18- and 19-inch color television sets, smaller color TVs, black-and-white television sets, black-and-white computer display terminals, combination radios and tape players, combination phonographs and tape players, communications satellites and parts, small electric motors, computer tape and disks, window air conditioners, electric measuring devices, power hand tools, pumps and parts, refrigerators and commercial photographic film.    The list of potential targets, which is to be published in tomorrow's Federal Register, actually represents about $900 million worth of goods. The administration will call for public comments from importers and other businesses by mail and at a public hearing to be held on April 13. It then will pare the list to the $300 million level. The tariffs would take effect about April 17.    The White House isn't moving to restrict Japanese semiconductors directly because it doesn't want to hurt U.S. firms that need the imported chips for assembling other products. The idea is to make the chip makers' other exports here prohibitively expensive for Americans. U.S. officials say they don't expect the move to add much to inflation here because in most cases consumers can easily find alternatives.    The $300 million figure is what U.S. officials estimate American firms have lost as a result of a failure by Japan to comply with the eight-month-old accord. The 100% tariffs would replace the 3% to 7% tariffs that already exist on most of the affected products.    U.S. officials say Japan won't be able to avert imposition of tariffs on at least $135 million of the $300 million total. That portion is linked to U.S. charges that Japanese semiconductor makers have been engaging in predatory pricing in third-country markets, which is prohibited under the agreement that the two countries signed last July 31. A Commerce Department review already has found such &quot;dumping&quot; -- selling below the cost of production or fair market value at home -- has continued unabated, despite U.S. protests. Japanese semiconductor firms are selling abroad at an average of 59.4% to 63.6% of their home price.    But there is still a faint chance that Tokyo will escape the remaining $165 million worth of tariffs if it acts before April 17 to address a second U.S. complaint: that it is failing to live up to a promise in the accord to allow American semiconductor makers a larger share of Japan's own home market.    In the accord signed last summer, Tokyo promised to allow U.S. producers to expand their market share in Japan, then about 8.5%, to &quot;more than 20%&quot; by 1991. But a world-wide glut of chips, combined with the rise in the value of the yen, has made that difficult. U.S. producers' share actually has slipped slightly, to 8.4%.    Industry analysts say the government's efforts to enforce the pact have been thwarted because a handful of large Japanese producers -- such as NEC Corp., Hitachi Ltd., and Fujitsu Ltd. -- have refused to follow the Ministry of International Trade and Industry's &quot;administrative guidance,&quot; which technically doesn't have the force of law.    The Japanese have recently taken further steps to ease semiconductor tensions. On March 23, MITI ordered large Japanese chip makers to cut their production by a hefty 11% next quarter in an effort to pare back some of the excess inventories that have been prompting some of the third-country dumping. And intentional foot-dragging by MITI on issuing export licenses to microchip makers has all but brought semiconductor exports to a halt.    U.S. officials hope the imposition of U.S. tariffs will heighten political pressure on the recalcitrant Japanese firms to go along with MITI's appeal for moderation. Although the new U.S. tariffs won't be applied solely to specific companies, the products on the target list are mainstays of NEC, Hitachi and Fujitsu, and of two other alleged offenders, Oki Corp. and Toshiba Corp. Says Harald Malmgren, a Washington trade specialist: &quot;In another few weeks it's going to look a lot better.&quot;    The decision Friday wasn't an easy one for the president and his advisers. U.S. officials were well aware that Tokyo had begun taking steps to enforce the fragile semiconductor agreement, that Japan already is hurting from the impact of the decline in the dollar and that Mr. Nakasone is hurting politically. &quot;Japan is an ally and a friend,&quot; Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige lamented in announcing the retaliation. &quot;Nobody in the administration is very happy about having to do this.&quot;    But the administration was also facing the possibility that it could lose all leverage with Congress in the trade debate unless it demonstrated its resolve. Moreover, the administration's own top trade officials have become increasingly exasperated at Japan's snail's-pace response to U.S. trade complaints. &quot;There's a feeling of tremendous frustration here,&quot; a senior U.S. trade official says. &quot;The Japanese have been nickel-and-diming us for years.&quot;    Friday's announcement marks the second time in 15 months that the U.S. has formally retaliated against Japan after failing to resolve a trade dispute. In December 1985, in a much smaller-scale move than Friday's, the administration slapped tariffs on $24 million worth of Japanese imports to protest Tokyo's refusal to lift restrictions on U.S. leather exports. The action resulted in Japanese concessions. Last year, in a dispute involving Japanese refusal to ease cigarette duties, trade officials were on their way to the White House with retaliatory tariff orders when Tokyo telephoned with a compromise.    While Tokyo is expected to take some steps to ease the immediate tensions, there is no guarantee that the new U.S. salvo will produce the change in long-term attitudes that Washington is hoping for. Clyde Prestowitz, a former Commerce Department specialist on Japan, warns that although Japan is unlikely to counterretaliate openly, it can easily &quot;get back&quot; at the U.S. covertly.    &quot;The feeling already is broad and deep in Japan that the U.S. is picking on them and making them the scapegoat,&quot; Mr. Prestowitz says. As a result, he says, the U.S. action could &quot;hurt to some extent the ability of American companies to sell in Japan.&quot;    Moreover, notes Henry Nau, a former Reagan-administration national-security aide, with the U.S. now so dependent on Japanese capital to help finance its budget deficit, &quot;the spat we're going through has a real potential for some misunderstanding and some explosion.&quot;    Meanwhile, the U.S. action may embolden other major trading blocs that have longstanding trade disputes with Japan. Sir Roy Denman, the Common Market's ambassador to the U.S., says the 12-nation European compact will be &quot;watching this whole thing like hawks&quot; to see how Japan responds. The outcome could influence Europe's own tactics in dealing with Japan, he says.    But the jury is still out on what Friday's decision means over the longer haul for U.S.-Japanese economic relations, for broader U.S. trade policy or for the global trading system as a whole. So far, the U.S. action is intended only as another, somewhat stronger message. Washington still hasn't abandoned its efforts to open markets abroad or its push for global trade-liberalization talks. &quot;Hopefully,&quot; says Trade Representative Yeutter, &quot;this will change some attitudes.&quot;    ---                       Tariffs and Trade               (In billions of dollars for 1986) U.S. current account deficit                 $140.57 Japan trade surplus with U.S.                  51.48 U.S. electronics trade deficit with Japan*     20.40 Electronics trade to be affected by tariffs  $300 million *Estimated by American Electronics Association</TEXT></DOC>
