<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-05-0157 </DOCNO><TEXT>Calculates reliability factors for two variants of shaft hoist disc brakingsystems, type ASEA operated in Poland. The first has two hydraulic discbrakes, each with its own hydraulic back-up pump. The second variantalso has two hydraulic disc brakes but only one joint back-up pump. Calculatedequipment reliability factors include intensity of failures, intensityof repair, mean repair time, repair factor and availability. The analysisshows that the decline in reliability of the second design variant withone back-up pump is negligible. The second variant is therefore recommendedfrom an economic point of view. 5 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
