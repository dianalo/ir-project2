The Terminal Annex is a large building, four stories high andcovering nearly an entire city block, where between 2,000 and 3,000 employeeswork. The building is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week.In 1981 Harold Powell, a BEP-licensed blind vendor, was awarded the vendingfacility to be located at the Terminal Annex. This facility proved to bevery lucrative for Mr. Powell, providing him a net income of between $84,000and $86,000 during fiscal year 1985, compared to the average net incomefor Randolph-Sheppard operators of $28,743 in Colorado and $20,946 nationally.In February of 1986, shortly after Powell announced his intention to retire,BEP informed Colorado's Blind Vendors Committee of its intention to splitthe Terminal Annex into two vending facilities. The Committee, on March27, 1986, unanimously issued a resolution objecting to the proposed divisionof the Terminal Annex.In April 1986, BEP announced its decision to divide the Terminal Annexinto two facilities for blind vendors. Hudson and Jack then requested,pursuant to 20 U.S.C. 107d-1(a), a formal evidentiary hearing on this decision.The Colorado Department of Social Services, which conducted the hearing,concluded that BEP had failed to consider a number of relevant factorsin reaching its decision to split the Terminal Annex and ordered BEP toreconsider this decision and allow the Committee of Blind Vendors to participatefully in this process.Hudson and Jack, however, filed a complaint for arbitration of this matterwith the U.S. Department of Education pursuant to 20 U.S.C. 107d-1(a).An arbitration panel was convened, held hearings on October 19 and 20,1987, and rendered its decision on December 14, 1987.The Panel ruled that BEP's decision to divide the Terminal Annex into twovending facilities ``did not violate the Randolph-Sheppard Act, any regulationissued thereunder or any policy then in effect'' and rejected the conclusionof the Colorado Department of Social Services that this decision was basedon ``inadequate information.'' Eight specific substantive and proceduralissues, involving policies and procedures established at both the Federaland State levels, were addressed in the decision. The Panel's rulings onthese issues are as follows:1. BEP's decision to divide the Terminal Annex into two facilities didnot constitute illegal rulemaking under Colorado law. A rule, as definedby Colorado law, is a statement of general applicability. The decisionto split the Terminal Annex, however, does not involve rulemaking becauseits effect is limited to that one case and is therefore not generally applicable.2. The decision to divide the Terminal Annex did not constitute an unlawfullimitation on income in violation of 20 U.S.C. 107d-3(a). This provisiononly applies to blind licensees who are currently operating a facility.Since Mr. Powell retired in May of 1986, there has been no licensee operatinga vending facility at the Terminal Annex. The decision to split the TerminalAnnex did not violate 20 U.S.C. 107d-3(a) because the income of no blindlicensee was affected as a result.3. The decision to split the Terminal Annex did not violate the requirementof 20 U.S.C. 107d-4 that blind vendors be given an opportunity to developtheir maximum vocational potential. Precluding Hudson or Jack from havingan opportunity to bid on a vending facility that has the potential of increasingtheir income from $40,000 to $80,000 does not violate this requirement.Moreover, it was reasonable for BEP to conclude that the best means offulfilling this obligation towards all of its blind vendors is by increasingthe total number of vending facilities.4. BEP's decision to employ two blind vendors at the Terminal Annex doesnot violate BEP's policy against forced partnerships. The two vendors wouldnot be, as the legal definition of partnership in Colorado provides, co-ownersof a single enterprise, but operators of independent facilities that happento be located in the same building. Any cooperation on pricing that thevendors might engage in would not preclude them from competing on othergrounds or negate their status as operators of independent facilities.5. The Randolph-Sheppard Act does not provide the Blind Vendors Committeewith standing to participate in this arbitration proceeding. The relevantprovisions of the Randolph-Sheppard Act, 20 U.S.C. 107d-1(a) and 107d-2(b),and its implementing regulations, 34 CFR 395.14(b)(2), only authorize blindvendors to file complaints for arbitration.6. BEP did not violate the overall objectives and policies of the Randolph-SheppardAct by its decision to divide the Terminal Annex into two facilities. TheAct itself, in 20 U.S.C. 107(b)(2), specifically contemplates the locationof more than one vending facility in Federal installations. Legislativehistory and policy interpretations issued by the U.S. Department of Educationsupport the view that, where appropriate, more than one vending facilityshould be located in a Federal building.7. BEP violated 20 U.S.C. 107b-1 by precluding meaningful participationby the Blind Vendors Committee in the decision to divide the Terminal Annex.This decision, however, was based on adequate information and did not constitutean abuse of the discretion on BEP's part.8. Hudson and Jack are not entitled to damages or attorneys' fees. Theconclusion and order of the Panel was that BEP's decision to split theTerminal Annex into two facilities did not violate any substantive provisionsof the Randolph-Sheppard Act. The Panel, however, admonished BEP to allowthe Blind Vendors Committee to have meaningful participation in futuredecisions. One of the three members of the Panel dissented from its decision,arguing that splitting the Terminal Annex eroded the income of blind vendorsin violation of the basic purposes of the Act, which is to expand theiropportunities. According to the dissenting panel member, such limitationshave to be approved by the Secretary under 20 U.S.C. 107(b).<ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-13514 Filed 6-6-89; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4000-01-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
