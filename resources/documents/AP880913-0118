Col. Galileo Torres said guerrillas attacked the El Paraisogarrison, headquarters of the 4th army brigade, in Chalatenangoprovince at 1:05 a.m. with mortar fire.   Nine soldiers and five guerrillas died in the attack 37 milesnorth of the capital of San Salvador and 12 government troops werewounded, he said.   Torres, head of the armed forces press office, also said therewere a series of clashes in northern Morazan province betweengovernment units and guerrillas.   The rebels suffered 50 casualties in Morazan and five soldierswere wounded, he said in a telephone interview.   Both provinces are strongholds of the rebel Faribuno MartiNational Liberation Front where guerrillas move freely and evenexercise some administration of towns and villages.   He said the fighting at El Paraiso lasted two hours and officerson the scene believed ``quite a few'' rebels were wounded. Thebodies of five rebels and six M-16 assault rifles were recovered,Torres said.   It was the first guerrilla attack on a brigade headquarterssince a February assault on the 3rd brigade in eastern Usulutanprovince.   A U.S. military adviser, the first to die in combat, was killedat El Paraiso in March 1987 when rebels penetrated the base,killing 70 government soldiers. There are several dozen U.S.military advisers at bases in Chalatenango.   Torres said the fighting in Morazan began at 4 p.m. Monday andlasted until 3 a.m. Tuesday. He called it a series of encountersbetween three government commando units of about 15 men each and a``significant'' guerrilla column.   Helicopters ferrying wounded soldiers and supplies were stillcoming under fire several hours after the main clashes ended, hesaid, and troops were still mopping up around Gigante Hill outsidePerquin, 125 miles northeast of San Salvador.   He said Col. Emilio Ponce, commander of the eastern militaryzone, told him at mid-morning there was still no breakdown betweendead and wounded in the 50 guerrilla casualities. He said he didnot know how many bodies had been recovered.   There was no way to immediately confirm the official casualtyfigures.   Earlier this month, the military claimed 25 rebels dead nearTejutepeque in central El Salvador. But reporters at the sceneconfirmed only four dead. Precise casualties are also hard to pindown because the rebels try to remove their dead from thebattlefield.</TEXT></DOC>
