Although the juxtaglomerula cells of thekidney are the primary source of plasma renin, the enzyme is also synthesisedin significant amounts in the submaxillary gland (SMG) of the mouse.The production of SMG renin is particularly interesting because it isunder androgen regulation. In addition, inbred strains of mice can bedivided into two distinct phenotypes according to the level of SMG reninactivity expressed. The authors demonstrated the genetic basis of thephenotypic variation, analysed the structure of the genes, and are investigatingthe control mechanisms and basis of tissue specific expression.</TEXT></DOC>
