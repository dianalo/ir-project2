Greenspan, speaking at the annual dinner of the Japan Society,said that as technology has progressed, economic growth has shiftedtoward analytical advances rather than producing an increasedphysical volume of goods.   Once-bulky radios now are powered by pocket-sized transistorpacks, metal beverage cans are thinner than they once were, tinyfiber optics are being used in place of tons of copper, and newbuildings use less concrete, glass and steel than they once did,Greenspan said in citing a few examples.   This ``marked downsizing of economic output'' has made it easierfor goods and services to move across national borders _ andcreates a dilemma for countries that want to restrict trade, hesaid.   ``The extraordinary downsizing of goods will make protectionismincreasingly difficult to sustain in the years ahead, in the samesense that repressive national governments will have difficulty inblocking the satellite-transmitted flow of ideas to their people,''Greenspan said.   The Fed chairman said downsizing also could help relieveinflationary bottlenecks in the production process, as additionalsupplies from other world producers become more readily and quicklyavailable to fill shortages.   ``As we progress toward general downsizing of economic output,worldwide production and inventory controls become far morefeasible and inflationary dislocations less likely,'' Greenspansaid.   He said that while a major world economic disruption couldquickly bring back earlier protectionist barriers, ``technology isirreversible. The downsizing of goods will continue.   ``As a consequence, the ability to suppress worldwide trade willbecome progressively more difficult in the decades ahead,'' he said.   Greenspan cautioned that while the world trading systemgenerally has become more open since the end of World War II, ``wealso have seen some significant steps backward.''   ``We do not now have as liberal a trade and marketingenvironment as we will require if we are to continue to reap thebenefits of specialization, downsizing and technological change,''he said.   Greenspan said the coordinated efforts of the seven majorindustrialized nations, which now hold annual economic summitmeetings, should help hold back protectionism.   ``This process is bound to expand and become ever more pervasiveas the cross-border trade in goods and services grows as aproportion of world domestic demand,'' he said.   Greenspan was introduced at the dinner at a Manhattan hotel byhis predecessor as Fed chairman, Paul A. Volcker, a member of theJapan Society's board.   The Japan Society describes itself as a non-profit organizationdedicated to cultural, educational and political affairs.</TEXT></DOC>
