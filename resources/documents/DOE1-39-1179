<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-39-1179 </DOCNO><TEXT>The first-principles theory for calculating surface-state energies andsemiconductor band offsets is described. Within a quasiparticle interpretationof excitation spectra, the approach provides well-founded energies whichcan be compared directly with sepctroscopy measurements. Results forthe As-capped Si(111) and Ge(111) surfaces and for the GaAs-AlAs(001)heterojunction are discussed and compared with experiment. 14 refs.,3 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
