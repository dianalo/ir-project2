The card market has come under increased scrutiny in thepast week from President Bush and members of Congress, whobelieve lower rates will spur consumer spending. The issuecaused legions of bankers to rush to Washington to head offwhat they said would be a devastating law capping interestrates, while many have attributed the stock market's recentdecline to the impact the law would have on banks andeconomic growth.</LP><TEXT>   But recent data on card debt shows that users are, for themost part, insensitive to the level of interest rates, theeconomists say. In August and September, when the generallevel of interest rates was falling and card rates hardlybudged, outstanding card balances rose at annual rates of6.6% and 12.6% respectively.   That was faster than the gross national product growth forthose months when overall consumer installment debt wasactually declining. Thus, the economists say, cardholders arealready doing their part to stimulate the economy.   &quot;We've never found a link between lower rates on creditcards and faster rates of consumer spending,&quot; said DavidCross, senior consultant at the Futures Group, a Washington,D.C.-based firm specializing in consumer research. &quot;Interestrates have never been a big factor.&quot; The same is true forcorporate response to lower rates as the Federal ReserveBoard has found in its yearlong effort to boost corporatelending through lower rates.   Economists also don't buy the argument that consumers willbe even more willing to take on debt at lower rates becausethey are willing to do so at the higher levels. Consumers aredriven by broader economic factors, such as the loss of readycash and the need to stretch out debt payments, both of whichwould not be influenced much by lower rates, the economistssay.   &quot;There's no indication they would borrow any more at lowerrates,&quot; said Moshe Orenbuch, a credit-card analyst at SanfordC. Bernstein. &quot;Consumers like the convenience of a revolvingcredit and are less sensitive to interest rates than manywould have you believe.&quot;   To be sure, although total card debt has risen, balancesper card have fallen slightly in recent months, the NilsonReport, a newsletter tracking the credit-card industry, says.The reasons for the drop in average individual balances arethat more cards have been issued and that wealthierindividuals are believed to be paying down their card debt.And the debate in Congress over card rates could yet raiseconsumer awareness of high rates, thus pressuring the cardindustry to lower them.   Moreover, there clearly could be some benefit from a capput on card rates, allowing consumers to pay less interest.If the rate cap under discussion in Congress were enacted,consumers would reap a $10 billion windfall, the WEFA Groupcalculated, assuming balances remained unchanged. Ifindividuals spent the entire $10 billion, the addition to GNPwould be 0.2%, acccording to WEFA. That excludes thepossibility of using some of the proceeds to repay high debtloads.   However, that's &quot;a pimple on the overall economy,&quot; saidAlan Levenson, director of financial services at WEFA Group.   For many individuals, credit cards have acted as aneconomic buffer for many households during the recession,economists and other experts say. The flip side, some expertswarned, is that consumers and bank issuers could be at riskif the economy &quot;double-dips&quot; because of the high debt loads.   Revolving credit, which includes all forms of creditcards, stood at $231.9 billion in September, up from around$220 billion at the end of 1990, according to the FederalReserve Board. That's an increase of 5% so far this year and7% on an annualized basis, according to Moody's InvestorsService Inc., faster than the overall economy. Even adjustedfor inflation, card balances are up significantly.   &quot;It's not dramatic growth, but it's been growing fasterthan the economy,&quot; said Andrew Silver, a credit-card analystat Moody's.   Credit-card balances are rising despite a sharp fall inoverall consumer installment debt largely because of a sharpdrop in automobile loans. Mr. Silver pointed out thatcredit-card balances are rising even though consumers can nolonger deduct from their income taxes interest on consumerdebt. And given the weak retail sales data in the past fewmonths, most analysts do not attribute the rising balances toconsumer spending increases.   Many experts believe that as the economy withered, anincreasing number of consumers relied on credit cards forday-to-day consumer purchases. All the more reason, they say,why lower rates are not likely to spur more discretionarypurchases.   Unlike automobile loans and home mortgages, credit-carddebt carries no maturity. It is the last to be paid off andan alternative source of cash for strapped consumers.   &quot;It's like taking out a loan without applying for it,&quot;said Fabian Linden, director of consumer research at theConference Board.   &quot;With income weak, people look to credit cards as a sourceof liquidity to maintain their life styles,&quot; said Mr.Levenson.   Experts on consumer spending habits say that the increasednumber of white-collar layoffs contribute to the rise incredit-card balances outstanding. Surveys by the ConferenceBoard show that 20% of all households have had one memberunemployed in the past year, and that the average duration ofunemployment lasted 24 weeks. And the survey showed that 48%of all males who found jobs returned to work at lower wages.   &quot;Many households have been financially damaged,&quot; said Mr.Linden.</TEXT></DOC>
