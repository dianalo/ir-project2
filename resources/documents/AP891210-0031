The ceremony marking International Human Rights Day followedclashes just outside this border camp Thursday and Friday thatkilled at least one person and wounded two people, aid officialssaid.   Officials said the clashes involved Thai paramilitary personeland Cambodian traders along the border, also the scene ofintensifying fighting in the 11-year-old civil war.

The ceremonies, organized by U.N. relief officials, began withBuddhist monks in saffron robes praying for peace andschoolchildren singing a human rights song.   ``Human rights is sometimes seen as a Western idea, an ideaalien to Cambodian culture,'' one monk, Yos Hut, told severalthousand of the camp's 140,000 residents. ``This is not true.''   On a stage of bamboo and cloth, students in traditional costumesdanced and other refugees acted out a sketch of quarrelingneighbors who peacefully settle their disputes.   Eight pigeons were released and flew outside the camp, where therefugees are not supposed to go.   After a minute of silence, some participants ventured into anexhibition of paintings by refugees, showing the Khmer Rougekilling victims and dumping them into mass graves and Vietnamesesoldiers bayoneting and raping Cambodians.   At sundown, about 20 to 25 Western relief workers and about adozen refugees at Site 2 ended a 24-hour fast to appeal for theprotection of the Cambodians.   ``All of these border camps are human rights violations inthemselves,'' said an organizer of the fast, Corinne Bowmaker ofthe American Refugee Committtee.
