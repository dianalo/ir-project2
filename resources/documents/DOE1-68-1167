Deuterated desipraminelabeled at positions 2,4,6 and 8 [DMI-d/sub 4/(I)] was prepared directlyby heating desipramine in 10% DCI-D/sub 2/O at 80deg C for 8 hours. Desipraminelabeled at all eight aromatic positions (DMI-d/sub 8/) was synthesizedfrom iminodibenzyl-1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9-d/sub 8/. Desipramine labeled at positions1,3,7 and 9 [DMI-d/sub 4/(II)] was obtained by the ''back-exchange''of DMI-d/sub 8/ under the protio condition according to the exchangeprocedure of DMI-d/sub 4/(I). Deuterium atoms labeled at positions 2,4,6and 8 of desipramine were eliminated rapidly in 1N HCl at 80deg C, butthose labeled at positions 1,3,7 and 9 of desipramine were quite chemicallystable.</TEXT></DOC>
