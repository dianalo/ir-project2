Regulations implementing Amendment9 to the Fishery Management Plan for Commercial and Recreational SalmonFisheries off the Coasts of Washington, Oregon, and California were effectiveMay 1, 1989, and modified notice procedures for inseason regulatory actions.These regulations amended 50 CFR Parts 661.20, 661.21, and 661.23 to providefor immediate and actual notice to fishermen of such inseason actions throughtelephone hotlines and U.S. Coast Guard broadcasts and to establish theeffective dates and times for these actions through the notices issuedby telephone and U.S. Coast Guard broadcasts.Management measures for 1989 were effective on May 1, 1989 (Docket Number90515-9115, filed May 2, 1989).

Based onthe best available information, the commercial fishery catch in the subareais projected to reach the 7,500 chinook salmon quota by midnight, May 2,1989. Therefore, the fishery in this subarea must be closed to furtherfishing.In accordance with the revised inseason notice procedures of 50 CFR 661.20,661.21, and 661.23, actual notice of this closure was given to fishermenprior to 2400 hours local time, May 2, 1989.
