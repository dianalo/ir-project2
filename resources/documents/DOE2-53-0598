The carbon fibers, carbonised at1000/sup 0/C show a much stronger influence of oxidative treatment incomparison to carbon fibers, carbonised at 2800/sup 0/C. This influencecan be related with the fiber modulus. One significant result is thatHNO/sub 3/ oxidized fibers are highly reactive at room conditions. Forthe reason there is a reduction of mechanical properties of carbon fibersafter oxidative treatment.</TEXT></DOC>
