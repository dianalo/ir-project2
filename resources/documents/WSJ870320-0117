Mr. Eder, who resigned as a PaineWebber vice president last month, admitted in Manhattan federal court yesterday that he helped various wealthy customers of the firm hide at least $700,000 from the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Eder was indicted on the charges last week.    Attorneys for Mr. Eder strongly disputed the government's characterization of the crime last week as a &quot;money-laundering scheme.&quot; One attorney, Michael Feldberg, said the case was unrelated to insider trading or possible laundering of illegal profits. He said Mr. Eder was only helping customers avoid paying taxes. &quot;The acts occurred years ago before any of the current Wall Street hysteria,&quot; Mr. Feldberg said.    As part of a plea agreement, Mr. Eder, 41 years old, is cooperating in a continuing investigation. The government said the money scheme occurred with the &quot;approval and participation&quot; of other PaineWebber supervisors at the branch at 1221 Ave. of the Americas in Manhattan.    In his appearance before federal Judge Edmund L. Palmieri, Mr. Eder said he &quot;absolutely&quot; was guilty of the two counts. &quot;I'd like to get these charges behind me and move forward with my life,&quot; he said.    Though he said he didn't profit directly from the scheme, Mr. Eder told Judge Palmieri that the series of transactions did generate extra brokerage commissions for himself.    Mr. Eder, of Woodmere, N.Y., was PaineWebber's most highly paid broker and its biggest producer, at any office, from 1982 to 1986, according to the government.    Judge Palmieri released Mr. Eder on his own recognizance and set sentencing for May 27. Mr. Eder faces a maximum 10 years in prison and a $260,000 fine.    Separately, Bentley P. Whitfield, a former account executive and broker at Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., pleaded innocent in Manhattan federal court to mail fraud charges filed against him last week. Mr. Whitfield, 31 years old, denied charges that he diverted $8,400 intended for Merrill Lynch to his own use. Mr. Whitfield was released on his own recognizance pending a trial. </TEXT></DOC>
