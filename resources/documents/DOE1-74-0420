Irradiatedresin substances from crude oil undergo marked changes - photochemicalbreakdown to form gaseous hydrocarbons (methane, ethane and propane)and photochemical condensation. During the condensation step molar massincreases and three-dimensional structures are formed, these have a highsoftening point (above 400{sup 0}C) and do not dissolve in organic solvents.</TEXT></DOC>
