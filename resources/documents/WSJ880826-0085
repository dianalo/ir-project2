Shearson is seeking to raise $1.5 billion from big investors for a new LBO fund. Swarms of such funds have been launched in the past two years, spurred by the success of earlier buy-out pools. In a leveraged buy-out, companies are acquired with mostly borrowed money; managers then seek to pay down the debt by selling assets or streamlining operations.    Shearson already has earned an average annual profit of 121% on 12 previous LBO investments, according to its inch-thick memorandum to investors. Among those investments are such well-known companies as R.H. Macy andamp; Co., Dr Pepper Holding Co. and Tiffany andamp; Co.    But &quot;it's hard to use history as a predictor,&quot; said Scott Sperling, a portfolio manager of Harvard University's $4 billion endowment who specializes in nontraditional investments such as leveraged buyouts. &quot;There's been a dramatic increase in the number of players (managing LBO funds), and that portends an increase in the number of problems.&quot;    Mr. Sperling observed that much of Shearson's previous LBO investing has come about as a result of its lending or advisory role to companies. Generally, Shearson has been a relatively small partner in conjunction with other parties that led the buy-outs.    On the $3.7 billion buy-out of Macy in 1986, for example, equity investors put up a total of $300 million. Shearson's equity stake in the retailer was barely 1% of that, $3.5 million. Shearson acquired its equity in return for helping to finance other parts of the transaction. Shearson also provided just $100,000 of equity in the $162 million leveraged buy-out of Tiffany andamp; Co. in 1984. That was 1% of the jewelry retailer's initial $10 million in equity.    With its new fund, Shearson aims to invest in eight to 20 LBOs, including some where it will sponsor the transaction. Its submission to investors asserts that because Shearson is one of the largest U.S. securities firms, &quot;Shearson has priority exposure to virtually all major merchant banking transactions.&quot;    Some LBO veterans think Shearson can successfully switch from piggy-backing other firms' successful buy-outs to lining up its own. &quot;Shearson is one of the few Wall Street firms that does have a principal's mentality,&quot; said Robert Haas, a Dallas-based partner in Hicks andamp; Haas, which masterminded the Dr Pepper buyout. &quot;I think they'll be effective.&quot;    Still, Mr. Haas acknowledged the LBO business has grown tougher since its boom period of the early 1980s: &quot;There is substantially more money chasing too few deals.&quot; In some cases, he said, that leads to bidding wars that make it unlikely the winning bidder will ever realize much of a profit on the investment.    In a briefing to Japanese investors earlier this summer, Shearson conceded that its returns aren't likely to run at the 121% level. Its offering document talks of making investments that offer a minimum of 40% annualized returns, which would still be an ambitious target.    Shearson originally sought to raise $1 billion, but it has since expanded its target to $1.5 billion. A Shearson spokesman said commitments for $1.25 billion have been lined up. He wouldn't predict when Shearson would have the full amount and declare the fund to be operating.    The minimum investment in Shearson's fund is $10 million, and it is aimed at a small circle of institutions and sophisticated professionals. One big backer is believed to be Nippon Life Insurance Co., Japan's largest insurance company, which owns a minority interest in Shearson.    Because Shearson is marketing the fund only to this small group, it needn't register the offering with the Securities and Exchange Commission. That is also the reason its memorandum to investors is marked confidential.    Shearson itself plans to invest $100 million in the fund, which will formally be known as Shearson Lehman Hutton Merchant Banking Partnership L.P. As is typical in LBO funds, Shearson will be general partner and collect about 20% of the profits from investments; other investors will get the rest.    Meanwhile, Shearson employees are slated to invest about $200 million of their own capital alongside the fund.    While Shearson plans to put 75% of the fund's assets into LBOs, it is keeping its options open for the remaining 25%. These could include defensive minority investments in companies, often known as white knight investments, as well as investments in over-leveraged companies that need recapitalization on terms that Shearson likes. Shearson's memo says it won't invest in hostile transactions, though.    With the glut of LBO money, some other buy-out funds are keeping their options open as well. The largest such fund, a $5 billion fund raised by Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., made waves earlier this year when it bought a 4.9% position in Texaco Inc. But KKR had told its investors last summer that it might make such &quot;toehold investments&quot; in addition to traditional LBOs.    ---       Shearson Gets Big Gains From Small Investments    Dollar amounts in millions                           SHEARSON     CURRENT     ANNUAL                             STAKE       VALUE      RETURN    Sheller-Globe            $20.0       $40.6       72.0%    Dr. Pepper                11.2        83.9      224.8    Sun Distributors           4.0        12.0      165.9    R.H.
