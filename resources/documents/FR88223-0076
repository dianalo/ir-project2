It addresses theimpacts of Aptus' Proposed Action (the Aragonite Alternative); the SkunkRidge Alternative; the Clive Alternative; the Aragonite and Clive Alternative;and the No Action Alternative. All sites are located in Tooele County,approximately 70 miles west of Salt Lake City along Interstate Highway80. The DEIS also addresses the amendment of BLM's Tooele Management FrameworkPlan to allow a propsed land exchange to take place.The incinerator would be designed to thermally destruct both ``hazardous''chemical waste materials, as defined under the Resource Conservation andRecovery Act (RCRA) and ``toxic'' chemical waste materials, as definedunder the Toxic Substance Control Act (TSCA). The proposed facility wouldincinerate up to 10 tons of wastes per hour at approximately 7,000 operatinghours per year. The transfer and storage area would operate 365 days ayear, 24 hours a day. While the actual facility is proposed to be constructedon private land, the transportation and utility corridors would cross Federalland administered by the BLM. A land exchange is also proposed as partof all alternatives except No Action.A limited number of DEISs are available upon request at the following BLMoffices:<ITAG tagnum="15">Utah State Office, 324 South State, Suite 301, CFS Building, SaltLake City, Utah 84111-2303.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Salt Lake District Office, 2370 South 2300 West, Salt Lake City, Utah84119.</ITAG>Public reading copies are also available at public libraries in Salt LakeCity, Wendover, Tooele, and Grantsville, Utah.Public hearings to receive oral and/or written comments on the DEIS willbe held at 7 p.m. at the following locations:<ITAG tagnum="14">March 16, 1988</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">Tooele County Courthouse</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">47 South Main</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">Tooele, Utah</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">March 17, 1988</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">Salt Lake County Commission Chambers</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">Salt Lake County North Building</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">Room N 1100,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">2001 South State Street</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">Salt Lake City, Utah</ITAG>Comments will be accepted until April 26, 1988 and should be sent to: Mr.Dean Zeller, Salt Lake District Manager, Bureau of Land Management, 2370South 2300 West, Salt Lake City, Utah 84119.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: </T2>.<ITAG tagnum="15">Ms Margaret Kelsey at (801) 524-3128,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Mr. John Stephenson at (801) 524-6762.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Date: February 12, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Kemp Conn,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Acting State Director.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 88-3735 Filed 2-22-88; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4310-DQ-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
