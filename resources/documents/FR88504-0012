L. 100-242, approved February 5, 1988) (the 1987 Act).This provision requires HUD to regulate charges for accommodations (rents),facilities, and services for certain multifamily projects with HUD-insuredmortgages. Regulation must occur where (1) the mortgagor did not take steps,by December 1, 1987, to amend its regulatory agreement to incorporate regulatorychanges published on April 19, 1983 and June 4, 1986, permitting mortgagorsto determine the rental and other charges for their projects or to usealternative formulae for setting maximum project rents; and (2)(A) theproject was receiving Section 8 assistance (other than Housing Certificates)as of December 1, 1987, or (B) not less than half of the project unitsare occupied by lower income families.1. The April 19, 1983 RulemakingOn April 19, 1983, the Department published a rule changing the requirementsfor HUD control of rents and other charges for projects with mortgagesinsured under sections 207, 220, and 221 of the National Housing Act (NHA).(See 48 FR 16670, effective June 1, 1983.) Under section 207 of the NHA(before its later amendment by the Housing and Urban-Rural Recovery Actof 1983), HUD was required to regulate rents and other charges. Under sections220 and 221 of the NHA, regulation of rents and other charges was discretionarywith HUD, but the Department had elected to control charges for these programsas well. 24 CFR 207.19(e), 220.511, and 221.530 all required HUD's advancewritten approval for the establishment of any rental or other project charge.With respect to rental charges, HUD controlled these projects by a strictformula based on historical costs and a rate of return that was a fixedpercentage of the project's initial replacement cost.The April 19 final rule made two principal changes in this regulatory scheme.First, the Department used its deiscretion under sections 220 and 221 ofthe NHA to deregulate rents and other charges in unassisted projects: mortgagorscould set their project rents and other charges in accordance with therental market in the area. Regulation of rents continued only for unitsreceiving certain types of Section 8 assistance, projects receiving Section8 Loan Management Assistance, and projects insured under section 221(d)(3)of the NHA. The regulation of certain charges for facilities and servicescontinued for each of these units and projects, as well as for section221(d)(4) elderly or handicapped projects.Second, the Department implemented an alterantive rental formula for 24CFR Part 207. The first part of the formula instituted a forward-budgeted(12-month) system of setting rents. This replaced the historical costsapproach used under the old rule. The second part of the formula_the ``deregulatorycomponent_permitted mortgagors to obtain a realistic return on their investmentin the project, based on the overall appreciation in the property's value.Under the second component, mortgagors could choose to determine rentalsbased on the lesser of (1) a current fair market value approach or (2)rents for comparable units in the area. HUD would approve rental adjustmentsdetermined under either the forward-budgeting or the ``deregulatory'' elementof the formula, at the mortgagor's option.The forward-budgeted element of the formula was also made applicable toprojects that were insured under section 207, 220, or 221 of the NHA andthat had Section 8 Loan Management Contracts under 24 CFR Part 886, SubpartA, and to assisted projects under sections 221(d)(3) and 236 of the NHA.2. The June 4, 1986 Rule MakingOn June 4, 1986, the Department published a second rule dealing with rentsand other charges under sections 207, 220, and 221 of the NHA. (See 51FR 20264, effective July 21, 1986.) The rule was primarily designed toimplement section 431 of the Housing and Urban-Rural Recovery Act of 1983(the 1983 Act). Section 431 gave HUD discretion to deregulate rents andother charges for mortgages insured under section 207 of the NHA on orafter November 30, 1983. The June 4 rule generally ended HUD's regulationof rents for section 207 projects with mortgages insured on or after thatdate. HUD regulation of these projects continued for rents and other chargesfor units occupied by Section 8 tenants and for subsidized projects refinancedpursuant to section 223(f) of the NHA.Regulation also continued for project rents where the mortgagor opts forregulation in order to maintain the project's tax-exempt status or wherethe effect of HUD deregulation would be the imposition of State or localrent controls that State or local law previously held inapplicable becauseof HUD's rent regulation. In both of these situations, the maximum permissiblerental charges are determined by the alternative section 207 formula establishedby the April 19, 1983 rule.The rule gave mortgagors of projects that were insured under section 207,220, or 221 of the NHA and that contained Section 8 Loan Management Assistancethe option of having rent charges determined under the alternative section207 formula, discussed earlier. It also added provisions (analogous tothe section 207 provisions) for HUD rent regulation to maintain a project'stax-exempt status or to avoid applicability of State or local rent controls.<ITAG tagnum="84">Section 425 of the 1987 Act</ITAG>Section 425 applies where a mortgagor has not, as of December 1, 1987,executed (and filed a written request with HUD to enter into) an amendmentto the project's regulatory agreement pursuant to the April 19, 1983 andJune 4, 1986 rules, electing to deregulate rents or to use an alternativeformula for determining the maximum allowable rents under those rules.1. Section 207 of the NHAIn the case of section 207 of the NHA, section 425 of the 1987 Act coversthe following situations:<ITAG tagnum="81">a. The Alternative Rent Formula Under the April 19, 1983 Rule</ITAG>Since only projects that were insured pursuant to a firm commitment issuedbefore the effective date of the rule (June 1, 1983) would need a changein the regulatory agreement to use the alternative formula, section 425applies only to these projects.<ITAG tagnum="81">b. The Alternative Rent Formula for Projects With Section 8 Loan ManagementUnits Established By the June 4, 1986 Rule</ITAG>Since section 431 of the 1983 Act and the June 4 rule deregulated rentsfor mortgages insured on or after November 30, 1983 (including the rentsfor unassisted units in a project receiving Loan Management assistance),only mortgages insured before that date would need a regulatory agreementto use the alternative rent formulation. Thus, section 425 of the 1987Act would only apply to projects with Section 8 Loan Management units wherethe project mortgage was insured before November 30, 1983.2. Sections 220 and 221 of the NHASection 425 of the 1987 Act covers the following situations involving propertywith mortgages insured under section 220 or 221 of the NHA:<ITAG tagnum="81">a. Deregulation of Rents and Other Charges Under the April 19, 1983Rule</ITAG>Since only projects that are insured pursuant to a firm commitment to insureissued before the effective date of the April 19 rule would require a changein the regulatory agreement to obtain deregulation, section 425 only coversthose mortgages.<ITAG tagnum="81">b. The Alternative Rent Formula For Projects With Section 8 Loan ManagementUnits Estabished By the June 4, 1986 Rule</ITAG>Again, section 425 of the 1987 Act applies only to mortgages insured pursuantto a firm commitment to insure issued before the effective date of therule_July 21, 1986.3. Summary of CoverageBased on the foregoing, section 425 applies to the following situations:a. Mortgages that are insured under section 207 of the NHA pursuant toa firm commitment to insure issued before June 1, 1983, where the mortgagorcould have elected to use the alternative rent formula established by theApril 19, 1983 rule.b. Mortgages that are insured under section 220 or 221 of the NHA pursuantto a firm commitment to insure issued before June 1, 1983, where the mortgagorcould have elected to deregulate charges for rents, facilities, or servicesunder the April 19, 1983 rule.c. Mortgages (1) that were insured (i) under section 207 of the NHA beforeNovember 30, 1983 or (ii) under section 220 or 221 of the NHA pursuantto a firm commitment to insure issued before July 21, 1986, and (2) thatcontained units receiving Section 8 Loan Management assistance, where themortgagor could have elected to use the alternative rent formula establishedunder the June 4, 1986 rule.4. Changes That the 1983 and 1986 Rules Made to the Determination of Rentsand Other Charges That Are Not Subject to Section 425The 1983 and 1986 rules made the following changes in the way rents andother charges are determined that are not subject to section 425:a. <T3>Forward-budgeted rent formula for Loan Management projects. </T3>TheApril 19, 1983 rule established a forward-budgeted method for determiningrent adjustments for projects with Section 8 Loan Management assistanceunder sections 207, 220, 221, and 236 of the NHA. Although this changeliberalized the way rents were computed, it did not amount to a deregulation,and therefore, does not fall within section 425's coverage.b. <T3>Continued HUD rent regulation where necessary to maintain tax-exemptionor to avoid rent control. </T3>The June 4, 1986 rule established provisionsfor continued HUD control of rents to maintain the tax-exempt status ofthe project or to avoid State or local rent control laws by means of thealternative section 207 formula. Although these provisions use an alternativemethod for making rent determinations, they involve the continued regulationof projects that would not otherwise have been regulated. Section 425 runsthe other way_it is concerned with imposing regulation on those projectsthat were formerly regulated and qualified for some measure of deregulation.Thus, section 425 does not apply to these provisions.5. Coverage of Section 425One point should be noted about the coverage of section 425(l). This criterionapplies if:<ITAG tagnum="21">The project owner and the Secretary have not executed, <T3>and </T3>the project owner has not filed a written request with theSecretary to enter into an amendment to the regulatory agreement . . .(emphasis supplied)</ITAG>The Department does not believe that the underscored ``and'' should beinterpreted as requiring that project owners must meet <T3>both </T3>of the statutory elements_execution of an amendment <T3>and </T3>request for an amendment_to determine whether they fall withinsection 425's coverage. Such a reading seems inappropriate in the contextof section 425(l) and makes little sense in the context of how changesin regulatory agreements are made.It is true that in a simple declaratory sentence, use of the word ``and''connecting two criteria should ordinarily be read conjunctively: <T3>both </T3>criteria must be met. Section 425(l), however, is framedas an ``if * * * then'' sentence: <T3>if </T3>project owners have not executed a change in their regulatoryagreements, <T3>and if </T3>they have not filed a written request to HUD for a change,<T3>then </T3>HUD will control their project rents and other charges. TheDepartment believes that this sentence structure is best interpreted asproviding a <T3>series </T3>of criteria, <T3>either </T3>of which may be met for purposes of determining section425's applicability. Under this reading, the ``and'' should not be viewedas a true conjunctive, but rather as a connector of two independent concepts:If the owner fails to execute an amendment to the regulatory agreement,then the inquiry moves to whether the owner asked HUD for the amendment.If the owner has done <T3>neither, </T3>then controls will be imposed under section 425.This conclusion is supported by the fact that requiring the presence of<T3>both </T3>elements moots <T3>one </T3>of them. A request to HUD is the first step toward executinga change in the regulatory agreement: Viewed from the other end of theprocess, if a change has been executed in the agreement, then the ownermust have made a request for the change to HUD. If the owner must <T3>both </T3>ask for a regulatory amendment <T3>and </T3>execute one, the request criterion is rendered meaningless,since the request is an included element in the more rigorous criterionof amendment execution. The Department does not believe that Congress intendedsuch an unlikely result.Therefore, the Department will determine section 425(l)'s applicability,based on whether a project owner (as of the requisite date) either hasfiled a written request with HUD to amend its regulatory agreement <T3>or </T3>has in fact executed such a change.<ITAG tagnum="84">Other Criteria under Section 425 </ITAG>In addition to meeting the project mortgage criteria described above, projectssubject to section 425 must meet the following conditions:a. As of December 1, 1987, the project was receiving housing assistancepayments under a Section 8 contract (other than under the Certificate Program),or b. Not less than half of the project's units are occupied by lower incomefamilies (defined at 24 CFR 813.102). With respect to the first element, projects covered are those with Section8 contracts under 24 CFR Parts 880 (New Construction), 881 (SubstantialRehabilitation), 882, Subparts D and E (Moderate Rehabilitation), 883 (StateAgency_New Construction and Substantial Rehabilitation), and 886, SubpartsA and C (Loan Management and Property Disposition). Although not specificallyexcluded by section 425, the Department has opted to exclude the HousingVoucher program under section 8(o) of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 fromthe coverage of the statute. The Department believes that failure to mentionthe Voucher Program was an oversight and that the program should be excludedalong with its non-project-based cousin_the Certificate Program_that wasexplicitly excluded from section 425. With respect to the second element, the Department will determine the lowerincome family occupancy rate of a project, on the basis of tenant incomedata submitted to HUD by the project owner as part of its submission toamend the regulatory agreement to use an alternative formula to determineproject rents or to decontrol project rents. The Department believes thatthis approach, coupled with the notice of section 425's requirements thatHUD will send to project owners and HUD's annual review of project operations,including a comparison of project income and gross potential rent, willensure that project owners subject to section 425 meet the provision'srequirements. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulation under Section 425 </ITAG>Section 425 requires HUD to control the rents and other charges on coveredprojects as they were controlled before April 19, 1983. The Departmentdoes not believe that the term ``control'' should be interpreted as requiringHUD to resurrect and implement every aspect of the rules for establishingproject rents and other charges that existed before June 1, 1983_the effectivedate of the April 19 rule. As noted earlier, these rules determined projectrents on the basis of historical project costs and a static rate of return.This approach imposed severe financial hardships on many projects, andprompted the Department to reform the rules for setting rents and othercharges, begininng with the April 19 rule. The Department does not believethat in enacting section 425, Congress wished to jeopardize the financialstability of covered projects by requiring simple adoption of all pre-1983rules for projects covered by section 425. The Department believes, instead, that the term ``control'' must be construedin the context of section 425's propose. As noted earlier, Section 425is designed to prevent project owners that failed to take steps to formalizethe option of decontrolling their rents and other changes or determiningtheir project rents by alternative means (as permitted by the 1983 and1986 rules) from doing so after December 1, 1987. We believe that section425's injunction that HUD ``control'' rents and other project charges asthey were ``controlled'' before June 1983 means that owners subject tosection 425 may not now obtain HUD approval of these deregulatory options.It does not mean, however, that other changes in the 1983 and 1986 ruleswere not deregulatory in nature are unavailable to project owners coveredby section 425. One such provision is the forward-based budgeting system for unassistedsection 207 projects (contained as an element of Part 207's alternativerent formula) and for assisted projects under sections 207, 220, 221(d)(3)and 236 of the NHA. As noted above, this system changed the way in whichrents were determined for covered projects, by replacing the historicalmethod of costs setting rents. This change in method, however, did notalter the fact that HUD continued to control the project rents, and thus,does not fall within section 425's ambit. Therefore, the Department will permit project owners that are subject tosection 425 to determine rental charges for their projects on the basisof the forward-based system originally established in the April 19, 1983rule. This will help ensure the financial feasibility of the projects involved,and will ensure that all projects that have this feature_both subsidizedand unsubsidized_are treated alike. Consistent with these principles, the Department will ``control'' rentsand other charges on covered projects, as follows. The establishment ofrents and other charges for projects that are insured under section 207,220, or 221 of the NHA and that section 425 subjects to the impositionof pre-June 1983 regulation may not exceed those that HUD approves in advanceand in writing. In approving these charges and later rent adjustments, HUD will give considerationto providing for rental income necessary to maintain the economic soundnessof the project and a reasonable return on investment, consistent with reasonablerentals to tenants. HUD will permit project owners to use the forward-basedbudgeting concept contained in andSection; 207.19(e)(2)(ii)(A) to establishrentals. This provision provides that rental adjustments may not exceed:<ITAG tagnum="21">(1) the sum of the most recent year's audited operating costs or,as appropriate, updated certified operating costs (taking into considerationreasonably anticipated increases in operating costs that will occur with12 months of the anticipated effective date or the rent increase), and(2) the amount derived by applying the project's debt service factor toits original cost.</ITAG>It should be noted that the forward-based budgeting option was installedas part of the alternative section 207 rent formula established by theApril 19, 1983 rule. However, it was never included for unassisted Part220 or 221 peojects. These authorities went directly from full-scale regulationto deregulation, without an interim step (such as for Part 207 and assistedprojects) for forward-based budgeting. The Department will, however, makethe forward-based budgeting provision available to unassisted Part 220or 221 mortgagors who are subject to section 425's control. <ITAG tagnum="84">Refunds of Excess Charges  </ITAG>The rule requires that any project owner that is subject to section 425and that decontrolled its project's rents and other charges, or determinedproject rentals on the basis of an alternative rent formula, without executingan appropriate amendment to its regulatory agreement, must refund the difference(if any) between (1) the charges that project tenants actually paid foraccommodations (rents), services, and facilities after December 1, 1987,and (2) the charges that project tenants would have paid for such itemsfor the same period under the pre-June 1983 rules. The Department believesthat provision for refunds is mandated by section 425's requirement thatHUD control the charges for covered projects ``after December 1, 1987.'' <ITAG tagnum="84">Notice and Comment Rule Making  </ITAG>The Department believes that subjecting this rule making to notice andpublic comment before making it effective is unnecessary and contrary tothe public interest. Implementation of section 425 of the 1987 Act doesnot involve a significant exercise of HUD discretion. The rule involvesa limited class of multifamily projects that are readily identifiable onthe face of section 425. It also specifies the precise rules for regulatingrentals and other charges for covered projects_rules that were uniformlyused for multifamily projects with mortgages insured under sections 207,220, and 221 of the National Housing Act in prior years. In these circumstances,the public would have little upon which to comment, and any delay thatnotice and comment rule making would entail would unnecessarily preventthe Department from putting section 425's policies into place at the earliestpossible time.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Other Findings  </ITAG>A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment hasbeen made in accordance with HUD regulations in 24 CFR Part 50, which implementsection 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 42U.S.C. 4332. The Finding of No Significant Impact is available for publicinspection during regular business hours in the Office of the Rules DocketClerk, Room 10276, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 SeventhStreet, SW., Washington, DC 20410.  This rule does not constitute a ``major rule'' as that term is definedin section 1(b) of Executive Order 12291 on Federal Regulation issued onFebruary 17, 1981. Analysis of the rule indicates that it does not (1)have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; (2) causea major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; or(3) have a significant adverse effect on competition, employment, investment,production, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets. Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) (the Regulatory Flexibility Act), the undersignedhereby certifies that this rule does not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities. The rule deals with a relativelysmall number of mortgagors that meet section 425's requirements, some ofwhom will be small entities. It is not expected to affect a substantialnumber of small entities.  This rule was listed as sequence number 941 in the Department's SemiannualAgenda of Regulations published on April 25, 1988 (53 FR 13854, 13876)under Executive Order 12291 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
