Mulroney, at a nationally televised news conference from hishometown of Baie-Comeau, Quebec, said Parliament will be called backinto session next month to consider the pact and ``a whole series ofbilateral problems.''   Mulroney, fresh from the victory Monday, also said he had spokento President-elect George Bush and was willing to meet with himbefore the U.S. leader's inauguration.   The Toronto Star, which had bitterly criticized the tradeagreement, said in an editorial that the ``people of Canada havespoken convincingly.   ``With this historic mandate, Mulroney assumes an awesomeresponsibility: Canadians have put their future and that of theirchildren in his hands.''   Voters returned Mulroney to office with 170 seats in the 295-seatHouse of Commons.   He defeated two rivals who based their campaign on oppositiion tothe trade pact Mulroney signed with President Reagan. They claimedMulroney's free trade program would subordinate Canada to the UnitedStates and ultimately rob Canada of its sovereignty.   President Reagan, in Santa Barbara, Calif. for Thanksgivingvacation, phoned Mulroney today to congratulate him on the victory.Reagan said in a statement that the free trade agreement ``will be apositive factor in the economic future of both countries.''   In Point Clear, Ala., Bush said he welcomed the Mulroney victory,with whom he said he had a ``special kind of friendly personalrelationship.''   Mulroney's victory ``was most interesting because to a degree itwas a referendum on getting the free trade agreement through,'' Bushtold 20 Republican governors and two governors-elect at a meeting.   Figures with 95 percent of the vote counted showed the oppositionLiberal Party led by John Turner with 82 seats, more than double its40 of four years ago, and the socialist New Democratic Party of EdBroadbent with 43 seats, up from 30.   The popular vote broke down to about 43 percent for theConservatives, 32 percent for the Liberals and 20 percent for theNew Democrats, with the turnout at about 75 percent of the 17.5million eligible voters.   The Canadian Press news agency said the Conservatives had 5.4million votes, the Liberals 4.05 million and the New Democrats 2.4million.   The Canadian dollar, which had been jittery throughout thecampaign as investors hesitated at a possible Conservative defeat,surged on international markets to trade at more than 83 cents.   The Conservatives saw their power erode somewhat in the newlyexpanded 295-seat House of Commons. They won 169 races on Monday ascompared to 211 out of 282 seats in the 1984 election.   Businessmen in Canada and overseas reacted favorably today toMulroney's return, the first time a majority government has servedtwo successive terms since 1953.   Trevor Taylor, general manager of the Bank of Nova Scotia inTokyo, predicted ``a stronger Canadian dollar by the end of theyear.''   Canadians accepted the ``leap of faith'' that the 10-year deal toeliminate all remaining trade barriers with their economicallyintimidating southern neighbor was good for the country.   Turner and Broadbent vehemently opposed the trade pact, signedJan. 2, saying Canada would be beholden to America. The pact, passedby the U.S. Congress, requires ratification by Canada's parliament.   Mulroney predicted his second term would bring ``not just moreprosperity, but more opportunity and security for all Canadians.''Canada is enjoying a six-year economic boom.   A somber Turner said in Vancouver, British Colombia, that he hadfought ``with all my heart and with all my strength and I've got noregrets at all'' for waging the bitterly contested campaign, calledOct. 1 by Mulroney.   Broadbent told a half-empty union hall in Oshawa, Ontario, ``Itwould not be accurate to say as leader of the party in thiselection, this historic election, that I am not somewhatdisappointed.''   After a jittery start in the four small Maritime provinces ofAtlantic Canada, the Conservatives swept Quebec and did better thanexpected in Ontario, Canada's largest province where opposition tothe free trade pact was thought to be strongest.   They also did well across western Canada, especially in Albertawhere the important oil and gas industry was eager for the deal toproceed.   The Liberals did better than expected in the Atlantic provinces,while the New Democrats turned out best in British Columbia.   Mulroney has said he would call parliament back into session _likely by Dec. 12 _ to proceed with the legislation needed for theagreement to take effect Jan. 1 as scheduled.</TEXT></DOC>
