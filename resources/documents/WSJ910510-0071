Crude prices have been rising in recent sessions, and anumber of oil companies raised the price they will pay for abarrel of West Texas Intermediate at the refinery gate to$20.75 from $20.50.</LP><TEXT>   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude for Junedelivery settled at $21.93 a barrel, up 15 cents. It hadtraded as high as $22.11.   But most of the focus was in the gasoline market, which issensitive to the low level of gasoline inventories in theU.S. As a result, news that portions of three refineries hadto shut down boosted prices.   Shell Oil Co., a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group, said itsNorco, La., refinery caught fire Wednesday. The company saidthere was minor damage and that it should be back inoperation soon. The Port Arthur, Texas, plant of StarEnterprises Inc. also caught fire. Star, a joint venture ofTexaco Inc. and Saudi Arabia, said the refinery didn't incurmajor damage and should be restarted shortly. A portion of aSaudi Arabian refinery also shut down, and it isn't knownwhen it will restart.   Gasoline for June delivery finished at 73.02 cents agallon, up 0.94 cent, on the New York Merc. It had traded ashigh as 74.55. Anxiety about low inventories isn't as extremeas it might have been in past years because demand is downdue to the recession.   Meanwhile, some people believe petroleum prices could comeunder pressure as Iraq and Kuwait re-enter the world oilmarket. Speaking at the annual meeting of Coastal Corp.,Chairman Oscar Wyatt said, &quot;We could have a very rough twoyears in our industry.&quot;   Mr. Wyatt, who has had close ties with Iraq, said thatcountry could start selling sizable amounts of oil if theUnited Nations trade sanctions were lifted. &quot;Iraq can produce700,000 to 900,000 barrels today if President Bush will letthem,&quot; he said. In addition, he said, &quot;Kuwait will beproducing faster than you think.&quot;   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          LIVESTOCK and MEATS: Pork-belly futures prices settledsharply lower on weakness in cash prices, after a topsy-turvysession that saw futures prices rise in early trading. Bigfutures price declines over the previous two days had tradersbuying futures contracts in the morning, but a noon reportshowed the cash price for pork bellies, or uncured bacon,down about two cents. Cash prices are soft because the cashmarket is seeking a price level at which buyers will absorbexcess supplies of fresh pork bellies, which are still movinginto cold storage for want of demand, analysts said. Theweakness in cash prices yesterday took the strength out ofthe morning rally, and the July pork-belly contract settleddown 1.87 cents at 57.87 a pound.                                                                                                          PRECIOUS METALS: Silver futures prices traded in a widerange. After rallying to as high as $4.14 an ounce, silverfor July delivery fell back to end at $4.085, up 0.2 cent.Silver continues to find support among speculators, saidWilliam O'Neill, futures strategist at Merrill Lynch, butselling by producers appears to have thwarted yesterday'srally. Producers have been more restrained in their sellingrecently, he said, but they are likely to continue inhibitingany rallies in precious metals. Platinum also traded in awide range yesterday, with the July contract trading as lowas $388 an ounce and as high as $396 before ending at$394.80, down 60 cents. Trading volume has been very lightrecently, Mr. O'Neill said, which has exaggerated pricemoves. Japanese buying interest for jewelry manufacturingnormally picks up around this time of year, he added, whichcould help platinum prices a bit in the near term. June goldended 80 cents an ounce higher at $359.30.                                                                                                          COTTON: Futures prices strengthened as adverse weathercontinued to delay crop plantings in the Mississippi Deltaand West Texas. Cotton for July delivery ended 0.33 cent apound higher at 88.55 cents. After setting a newlife-of-contract high of 79.74 cents, October cotton ended at79.40, up 0.75 cent. Rain will continue to fall over theDelta region off and on through the middle of next week,predicted Jim Roemer, meteorologist at Freese Notis Weather,a consulting firm in Des Moines, Iowa, but it won't be asheavy as in recent weeks. Even if the crop is planted overthe next three to four weeks, he said, wet conditions mayreduce yields below normal. West Texas, where it is too dry,has the opposite problem. Rain expected over the weekend willallow some planting, Mr. Roemer said, but subsoil moisture isso low that West Texas yields may also fall. In California,the drought reduced the plantings earlier in the year andrecent rain and cool temperatures have slowed the growth ofthe cotton that was planted, Mr. Roemer said. Prices todaymay get a boost from the Department of Agriculture's crop andexport sales reports released late yesterday. Harry Robb, ananalyst at Cargill Investor Services, said both reports were&quot;friendly&quot; to cotton prices. The crop estimate of 16 millionbales for the 1991-92 crop was higher than last year's 15.5million but less than the 17 million that traders andanalysts had expected earlier in the year, Mr. Robb said. Andexport sales continue to be encouraging, he added. He expectscotton prices to &quot;run out of steam&quot; over the next two weeks.But, he predicts, July cotton will reach 95 cents before thecontract's expiration, so he would view any price decline asa buying opportunity.</TEXT></DOC>
