Almost 1300 daily activity reports submitted by oil companies tothe Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD) in 1984 have been reviewed.Estimates for the frequency of hazardous situations and spurious activationsof components within the safety systems are presented. The overall conclusionof this study is that the information in daily activity reports providesa good overview of trends and main problem areas on offshore productioninstallations. However, the frequencies and figures in the report mustbe used with care. Personnel involved in abnormal events may not reportall of these to the installation manager, and there may be several abnormalevents which the oil companies, more or less unintentionally, do notreport to the NPD. Additionally, free text descriptions of abnormal eventsare brief, causing difficulties when classifying the various events.The report is relevant to those concerned with production regularityand the safety of offshore installations. 6 refs., 11 figs., 8 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
