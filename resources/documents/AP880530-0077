MILLS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Not one Medal of Honor went to any of the 1.5million blacks who fought in World Wars I and II, a fact historianLeroy Ramsey wants to change.   Ramsey has found the records of two black servicemen he saysdeserve the medal: Sgt. Henry Johnson, of Albany, N.Y., and SeamanDorrie Miller of Waco, Texas. Johnson served in the Army duringWorld War I; Miller was in the Navy in the Second World War. Bothhave since died.   It was an accident that Ramsey, also of Albany, discovered noblacks had won the nation's highest military honor for braveryduring the world wars, although blacks have won the medal forheroic deeds in other wars. It was also a discovery born of anger.   ``In 1984, I was watching television when they celebrated the40th anniversary of D-Day in Europe,'' he said in a telephoneinterview last week. ``The president was over there, and the wholeweek was as white as a Ku Klux Klan rally.''   A black World War II veteran himself, Ramsey got angry that hisexperience of the war was not recognized, but turned that emotioninto a useful pursuit.   ``I decided to do a book on the black American in World War II,and when I got into my research I began to realize that no blackhad received the Medal of Honor in either World War I or World WarII,'' said Ramsey, a former associate history professor at HofstraUniversity on Long Island. ``So I put the book on the back burnerand took off on an effort to see if I could get that righted.''   Ramsey looked at the records of black servicemen who had wonother high military honors, including the Distinguished ServiceCross and the French Croix de Guerre. He looked into the history ofthe Navy's Medal of Honor, established by Congress in 1861, and theArmy's, established in 1862. And, he said, he read the more than1,200 citations of the Medal of Honor since its inception, ``tomake sure I was on solid ground.''   ``I didn't want this to be token because these guys wereblack,'' he said. ``I didn't want any compromising of principle onthe Medal of Honor.''   Ramsey discovered that Johnson, who fought with the French army,killed four German soldiers, rescued a wounded comrade and captureda stockpile of weapons all despite severe combat wounds. For hisactions, Johnson earned the Croix de Guerre, France's highestmilitary honor. He died in 1930.   Miller served at Pearl Harbor aboard the USS West Virginia,Ramsey said. When the Japanese attacked, Miller, a mess steward,helped move his mortally wounded captain from the ship's bridge,then returned to man a machine gun, according to Ramsey's research.   Afterward, the secretary of the Navy awarded Miller a letter ofcommendation, but Adm. Chester Nimitz, commander in Hawaii,upgraded that to the Navy Cross, the second-highest award, Ramseysaid. Miller was killed in 1943 in a torpedo attack.   Ramsey built up his case, but for two years, he couldn't get anypublic official to listen. He sent copies of a 21-page letter toevery member of the New York and Texas congressional delegations,but ``102 percent of those people ignored the hell out of me.''   ``It would have been easier for me to get a Boy Scout meritbadge for a communist,'' he said.   Finally, he received a letter of support from Rep. Mario Biaggi,D-N.Y., but Biaggi became embroiled in criminal trials in New Yorkand Ramsey's cause languished until New York Gov. Mario Cuomodecided it had merit.   ``Cuomo wrote me a very long letter and he took the time topersonally write each member of the congressional delegation inWashington and ask them to help me,'' Ramsey said.   ``Then, as if a voice from the dark, Joe DioGuardi came through.And the effort never stopped.''   Last October, DioGuardi, a Republican congressman fromWestchester County, N.Y., and Rep. Mickey Leland, D-Texas,cosponsored bills to waive the statute of limitations for the Medalof Honor so both men can be considered for the award.   In the cases of Miller and Johnson, both the Navy and Army haveopposed the bills, which are now before the House Armed ServicesCommittee, DioGuardi said.   The Navy did not specify why, according to DioGuardi, but theArmy laid out several reasons in a letter to Rep. Les Aspin,D-Wisc., who is chairman of the Armed Services Committee.   Delbert L. Spurlock, assistant secretary of the Army formanpower and reserve affairs, wrote that while others, includingmembers of Congress, had written to the Army requesting specialconsideration for Johnson, ``At this late date, it would beinappropriate to single out former Sergeant Johnson for award ofthe Medal of Honor and to provide preferential treatment to himover the thousands of other black soldiers who served so bravely incombat.''   Spurlock also said that Johnson's records were destroyed in afire in 1973 at the Army's National Personnel Records Center,although Ramsey said he obtained certified copies from archives inNew York state.   DioGuardi said he would not give up the fight.</TEXT></DOC>
