Alyeska, a consortium owned by British Petroleum Ltd.,Exxon Corp., Atlantic Richfield Co. and four other big oilcompanies, operates the 800-mile Trans-Alaska pipeline andthe tanker and the oil-storage terminal in Valdez, Alaska,where tankers take on loads of Alaskan crude bound for U.S.refineries.</LP><TEXT>   The new regulations mostly relate to a long-runningdispute over air pollution, both along the pipeline and atthe marine terminal. In conjunction with moves by the state,the Environmental Protection Agency intends to issue findingsthat Alyeska over the years frequently violated provisions offederal environmental statutes. Ray Nye, director of theEPA's Seattle office's air-quality section, said the agencybelieves the violations have significantly increasedemissions of potentially dangerous hydrocarbon vapors, whichcontain such toxins as benzene and toluene.   Ivan Henman, Alyeska's vice president for environmentaloperations, said the consortium believes it has not violatedany environmental regulations and that its operations areenvironmentally sound. &quot;We are extremely interested inprotecting the environment,&quot; he said. &quot;And we've saidrepeatedly that if there are problems, we'll correct them.&quot;   The regulatory moves could prove a costly blow to Alyeskaand its owners; one EPA official estimated that meeting justone element of the new regulations could cost &quot;many tens ofmillions of dollars.&quot; They could also signal a turning pointin more than a decade of generally fruitless or half-heartedefforts by environmentalists and state and federal regulatorsto force Alyeska to meet higher environmental standards.   The actions are more fallout from the Exxon Valdez oilspill, which continues to reverberate 14 months after thesupertanker ran aground in Alaska's Prince William Sound.Alyeska came under fierce public criticism for itsunsuccessful efforts to contain the 11-million gallon spill,the nation's largest. Many environmentalists and state andfederal regulators say that response reflected what criticsallege is Alyeska's blase attitude toward the environment,and a history of resisting proposals to upgrade itsoperations for environmental reasons. For its part, Alyeskaalways has maintained that its environmental record isexcellent.   But state and federal officials say the state's Departmentof Environmental Conservation now is in the final stages ofdrafting new air quality permits based on joint state andfederal investigations that have found that Alyeska hasfrequently violated federal pollution statutes over the yearsby modifying equipment -- such as incinerators for burningoff toxic vapors and turbines used to power pumps along thepipeline -- without conducting required reviews of how themodifications would effect hydrocarbon emissions. State andEPA officials have concluded that the modifications increasedair pollution.   Furthermore, state officials say the state intends torequire that Alyeska set up a system for capturing anddisposing of toxic vapors that stream out of vents on tankerdecks as oil is pumped from storage tanks into the ships'cargo holds. Alyeska has vehemently rejected past suggestionsfrom regulators that it should do that, but its case may havebeen weakened by a recent Arco study that found that as muchas 750 tons of benzene escape into the air each year duringloading operations. One state regulator described the benzenelevels as &quot;shockingly high.&quot; The EPA's Mr. Nye said thebenzene emissions are high enough to &quot;warrant concern aboutpotential health problems.&quot;   Indeed Alyeska, which for years had argued that tankerloading emissions weren't significant, now has a policyrequiring employees involved in tanker loading and certainother operations at the terminal to wear respirators.   Alyeska's Mr. Henman said Alyeska doesn't believe the datafrom the Arco study is sufficient evidence upon which to baseregulatory decisions. And he said Alyeska still maintains itslongstanding legal position on tanker-loading emissions, thatAlyeska can't be required to capture and dispose of theemissions because Alyeska doesn't own the tankers. Regulatorsfind that stance disingenuous, noting that many of thetankers are owned by the same big oil companies that ownAlyeska.   Mr. Henman also said Alyeska will soon begin anair-monitoring program that will test air quality in theValdez area. The study, financed and designed by Alyeska, hasbeen in the works for at least two years, but has been heldup by disputes between regulators and Alyeska over theplacement of monitoring devices, among other things. &quot;If thisprogram finds any problems, we will do whatever it takes tofix them,&quot; he said.   State officials don't intend to wait. They said they hopeto inform Alyeska of the new regulations officially by June1, when a temporary air permit issued two months ago expires.&quot;We have been going around and around with them for years,and now we are finally throwing down the gauntlet,&quot; said onestate regulator.</TEXT></DOC>
