Moreover, the liquidity of the money-center bankshas &quot;improved considerably.&quot;   The ratings of the big banks have plunged in recent years,falling to an average of triple-B-1 to double-A-2 between1986 and 1990, primarily as a result of deteriorating assetquality stemming from problems with commercial real estate.
