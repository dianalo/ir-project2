The carriers are wading into the controversy over calleridentification with products that identify callers to 800 and900 lines. While the Caller I.D. debate has centered onindividuals calling other individuals, the new long-distanceservices are likely to shift the focus to companies capturingdata, massaging it and passing it along to other companiesfor marketing purposes.</LP><TEXT>   The emerging phone-company services make it effortless forcompanies to compile mailing lists for direct mail ortelemarketing purposes or to sell or rent to other companies.At the same time, some companies that operate 800 or 900numbers are building their own mailing lists by matchingnumbers supplied by long-distance companies with consumerdata bases. Generally, about half of all calls to 800 and 900numbers can be accurately matched with the head of thehousehold and the address.   The commercial uses of consumers' telephone numbers raiseconcerns beyond the debate over local phone companies'transmitting Caller I.D. That's because companies, moreeasily than individuals, can link the numbers with data basescontaining personal credit history, marital status,automobile purchases, names and addresses of neighbors andso-called psychographic data on spending habits and productpreferences -- a window, if you will, into a callers' lifestyle.   &quot;The phone companies are now in a position to add valuebeyond just a phone call,&quot; says H. Skip Weitzen, vicepresident of strategic planning for Optima Direct, a smallWashington direct-marketing campaign firm. &quot;On the otherhand, the phone companies need to consider the privacyimplications of such enhancements.&quot;   Leading the emerging market for telephone company matchingis US Sprint Communications Corp., a subsidiary of UnitedTelecommunications of Kansas City, Mo. A Sprint Gatewaysservice called Targetlist lets customers choose whether theywant a printout, a computer tape or mailing labels. Sprintcan also provide names of nine neighbors, and can let callersrecord their own name and address at the end of the 900-linemessage. The company is planning yet another service thatdraws a callers' demographic and psychographic profile, saysAdrian Toader, Sprint Gateways director of sales andmarketing.   Retailers and other businesses, he says, are justbeginning to figure out how it can help them sell theirproducts. &quot;So far, few companies know what to make of theservice,&quot; Mr. Toader acknowledges. &quot;But Targetlist was aheadof its time.&quot; With 900 service, callers are alreadymotivated, he says, because they pay for the calls.   American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., which has a healthyand growing business of providing callers' numbers to 800 and900 customers, isn't yet providing names and addresses. MCICommunications Corp. of Washington recently put its toe inthe water, providing names and addresses to a few businesses.&quot;We're not ready to mass market a product,&quot; says PatriciaProferes, an MCI marketing specialist. &quot;But we are talking toa lot of different folks about marketing an off-the-shelfautomatic number identification solution package.&quot;   Among the recipients of callers' names and addresses isevangelist and politician Pat Robertson's ChristianBroadcasting Network. Paul Flanagan, CBN's vice president forinformation services, said MCI has been delivering the dataon callers to CBN's counseling, prayer and information lines.The information, he said, is merely piling up while CBNfigures out what -- if anything -- to do with it. Mr.Flanagan says the names won't be used for direct mail ortelemarketing. &quot;If somebody doesn't want mail, it's a wasteof postage, and may only make someone angry,&quot; he said. &quot;Welook for more of a personal touch.&quot;   Dow Jones andamp; Co., publisher of this newspaper and owner ofthe 900-Journal line, is one of the Targetlist customers. ADow Jones spokesman said the company started collecting thedata in January. &quot;It's just going on the shelf,&quot; he says, &quot;Itis cheaper to collect it now than to go back and gather itlater.&quot; The spokesman said the data has potential for use ininternal research.   Even on the shelf, the computer tapes and printouts worryprivacy experts. &quot;Computer matching violates a central ruleof fair information practices,&quot; said Marc Rotenberg, directorof the Washington office of Computer Professionals for SocialResponsibility. &quot;It undermines a caller's expectation ofprivacy and should be prohibited.&quot; Mr. Rotenberg finds thelong-distance angle particularly troubling because more andmore consumers use 800 and 900 services. A recent study byStrategic Telemedia of New York shows that 800 service hasbeen growing at an annual rate of 10% to 12% in recent years,with revenues projected to reach $6 billion this year. Thestudy projects that 900 service, estimated at $455 millionlast year, will soar to $3 billion by 1993.   To be sure, the identification of long-distance callerscould have limited value. Calls made from offices, publicplaces and phones with unlisted numbers generally don't windup on mailing or telemarketing lists. And phone companies andtheir business customers are concerned about privacyimplications, especially since congressional support growsfor a bill introduced by Sen. Herb Kohl (D., Wis.) that wouldlimit local phone companies' ability to provide callers'numbers. The bill, however, doesn't directly addresscommercial use of data from long-distance companies.   Consumer research from Advertising Research Corp. andStrategic Telemedia found that about a third of callerswouldn't dial 800 lines if they knew their phone number wasgoing to be captured. &quot;Companies are taking a wait-and-seeattitude because of fears of bad press and legislation,&quot; saysBruce Kushnick, president of Strategic Telemedia.   Nevertheless, the business of interactive telephoneservices that let callers push buttons to play games ortransmit information such as age or sex -- and the lists theycan generate -- is mushrooming, says Robert Lorsch, presidentof Teleline Inc., a Los Angeles company that has producedsuch interactive 900 services as the &quot;Lets Make a Deal&quot; lineand CBS's soap opera update line. Information providers aswell as telemarketing service bureaus, he says, aredeveloping dual income streams from their 900 numbers -- onefrom charging callers and the other from selling or rentinglists. &quot;Most companies in the information industry haven'tfigured out the proper non-invasive use of numberidentification and data capture,&quot; he says.   &quot;This is the fastest, cheapest, easiest way to build adirect response mailing list,&quot; says Optima Direct's Mr.Weitzen. &quot;And the back-end value is that you can market namesof people who are phone-responsive to catalog andtelemarketing companies. It's something consumers shouldunderstand.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
