The consensus at the four-day, real-estate industry gathering:    Communities are aligning with &quot;no-growth&quot; movements as traffic and other density-related problems worsen.    &quot;There is tremendous concern with zoning and land use,&quot; says Martin Bucksbaum, chairman of General Growth Properties Inc. in Des Moines, Iowa. He says localities are making it tough for him to find sites for shopping malls.    Developers say they are worried because they think the no-growth trend -- hatched in cities such as San Francisco -- is spreading to small communities.    Penn andamp; Schoen Associates Inc., a New York polling firm that surveyed 300 participants at the meeting, found 43% reporting development moratoriums in areas where they have invested. Sixty-two percent said the public's attitude toward developers is less favorable than previously. Most of those -- 88% -- cited growth-related traffic problems as the reason.    Unlike environmentalists of a few years back who pressed for some limits on development, some people are now opposed to any growth, says Roy P. Drachman, a Tucson, Ariz., developer. In Tucson, he says, activists want a law that would require a public referendum on any zoning change. &quot;They don't care about jobs,&quot; he says. &quot;They've got theirs, and they don't want any changes.&quot;    At a seminar on planning, Zev Yaroslavsky, a Los Angeles councilman, told of stopping in Kayenta, Ariz. (pop. 4,000), &quot;a little town in the middle of nowhere.&quot; A headline in the local newspaper reported &quot;Growth Controls Sought in Kayenta.&quot;    The anecdote drew laughs, but many developers sound defensive on who's responsible for growth problems. &quot;No one is the bad guy on growth,&quot; says Greenlaw Grupe Jr., a Stockton, Calif., developer and president of the land institute.    ANOTHER BIG LAND-USE ISSUE was the recent Supreme Court ruling that a property owner must be compensated when government regulation &quot;goes too far&quot; in restricting the use of his land. Developers have hailed the decision as a victory for property rights. But a panel of experts at the meeting said the decision probably was too vague and confusing for it to be widely applied. &quot;At first there was panic in public agencies&quot; about the erosion of zoning and other governmental powers, said panelist Larry Hogle, planning director for Irvine, Calif. But now that attorneys have reviewed the case, &quot;it's business as usual. It doesn't have any effect on our day-to-day decisions.&quot;    Most people at the meeting agreed that the steamroller of Japanese investment in U.S. real estate would continue for as long as Japan has surplus dollars to invest. The big question of Americans at the conference: how to hook up with a Japanese partner and cash in on the buying binge?    Distressed real estate drew interest. The country has $50 billion to $100 billion of it, said John Hatfield, a meeting panelist and regional manager with the Federal Asset Disposition Association, which assists in selling foreclosed assets.    How distressed are properties? In Houston, a building financed in 1984 with a $125-per-square-foot loan recently was appraised at $18 a square foot. The building, the Northwest Commerce Center, is empty. &quot;We've gotten one offer for it,&quot; Mr. Hatfield said, &quot;18 cents a square foot.&quot;    ---   SIGN OF THE TIMES: Wall Street investment bankers, eager to securitize more real estate, attended in droves. But the conference was largely ignored by the richest group of developers -- those from New York City. Donald Trump didn't attend. Neither did many of the lesser-known New York families that have made fortunes in real estate in their hometown. &quot;They are noticeably absent,&quot; observed Cleveland developer Daniel Biskind. &quot;They think New York is the Big Apple, so this has nothing to teach them.&quot;    ---   BREAKUP VALUE: Kenneth Rosen, manager of real-estate research for Salomon Brothers Inc. and a keynote speaker at the meeting, said that because divorces split households, they are &quot;the engine of growth in real-estate markets.&quot;    Then came the bad news: The divorce rate has leveled off. Said Mr. Rosen: &quot;We may have exhausted the supply of divorceable households.&quot;    Mr. Rosen also offered a list of &quot;loser cities,&quot; those projected to have the slowest growth in employment (a measure of how quickly real-estate demand is growing) over the next 10 years: Buffalo, N.Y.; Pittsburgh; Cleveland; Milwaukee; New Orleans; Youngstown, Ohio, and &quot;the entire state of West Virginia.&quot;    ---   THE IRONY of holding a real-estate convention a week after the Los Angeles area was hit by the country's biggest earthquake in more than a decade wasn't lost on participants. The Westin Bonaventure hotel, which was host to the convention, wasn't damaged. But a mild aftershock did rattle the convention's Saturday breakfast.    Dark-humor department: Frank Aries, a developer based in Colorado Springs, Colo., reckoned that if the long-expected &quot;big one&quot; does shake California, his property in Arizona will become valuable waterfront. </TEXT></DOC>
