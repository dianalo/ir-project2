<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-88-0293 </DOCNO><TEXT>A man-portable conrtrol unit has been designed and fabricated to supportteleoperation of a land vehicle. The basic contol unit is configuredto include the capabilities of mobile platform control, platform locationand status display, sensor contol and output display, and weapons contol,if so desired. When the platform is being driven to a new location, theoperator is able to control the platform through basic steering, brakingand speed commands, obstacle recognition and avoidance, maneuvering inconstricted space, and navigation with visual cues and simple dead-reckoninginputs from the vehicle. While the platform is on station, the humanoperator is able to perform the functions of surveillance, target recognition,target tracking, and weapons or designator control. A fully software-drivensystem has been configured to meet these requirements. All controls andvehicle signals are processed by an on-board microprocessor allowingthe system to be easily reconfigured. Video information is provided througha set of three CCTV monitors. Graphics and alphanumeric data are providedon a flat panel dislay. Push buttons, keypad, trackball, throttle lever,and a steering yoke accept operator input. A video cueing system is includedto allow automatic processing of the platform video for motion detectionsurveillance operations. The man-portable control unit was developedfor application to the Teleoperated Mobile All-Purpose Platform (TMAP)project supported by the US Army Missile Command (MICOM). The controlunit has been integrated with the MICOM vehicle system and with a vehiclesystem at Sandia National Labs. 2 refs., 7 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
