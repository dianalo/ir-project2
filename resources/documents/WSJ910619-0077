The project is the first under the EC's Interreg program,which aims to boost regional development across nationalborders in the 12-nation trade bloc.   Portugal said the project will directly benefit 1.6million Portuguese and 2.7 million Spaniards along thelongest border between EC states. Portugal's rural interiorand Spain's border areas are among the EC's poorest regions.   The project, expected to cost more than $600 million, willfocus on cross-border infrastructures to promote economicgrowth and social stability. Of the total cost, the EC willcover 70% and Spain and Portugal will pay the rest.                                                                                                          ROH BOOSTS MANUFACTURERS                                                                                                          South Korean President Roh Tae Woo said more funds shouldbe pumped into the nation's manufacturing sector to ease themoney crunch and enhance the industry's globalcompetitiveness. South Korean companies, particularlymanufacturers, have been hurt by a cash shortage, largelybecause of Seoul's money-supply squeeze. Economic officialssaid that starting next month, 155 billion won ($214 million)will be supplied this year to help develop 919 coremanufacturing technologies.                                                                                                          STRIKES IN ROMANIA SPREAD                                                                                                          Railway workers in Romania joined tens of thousands ofstriking doctors, teachers and industrial workers in growinglabor unrest mainly over pay and loss of jobs, as inflationhit 160% in the past three months. The rail strike's extentwasn't clear but a broad walkout could paralyze thebeleaguered economy, heavily dependent on rail transport forenergy imports. Prime Minister Petre Roman tried to avert ageneral strike planned for today by workers demanding hisNational Salvation Front government resign over its movestoward a market economy.                                                                                                          INDONESIA WELCOMES HOLLYWOOD                                                                                                          Jakarta said it would allow Hollywood studios to set upoffices in Indonesia but would retain local control ofdistribution of U.S. films. The issue has been a sore pointwith U.S. film studios, which want to promote and distributetheir own films in Indonesia, its 180 million people makingit potentially one of the world's most lucrative markets.Jakarta regulates film imports to protect the domesticindustry and national culture. Now foreign studies could takea share of local audience receipts. They previously had tosell their films outright to local companies.                                                                                                          ATHENS POLLUTION THE WORST EVER                                                                                                          Greece advised Athenians to stay indoors and reduce use ofcars in the capital, where air pollution rose to recordlevels. Ozone levels reached a new high of 393 milligrams percubic meter of air, far above the 300mg safety limit. About80 people were treated in hospitals for heart and respiratoryproblems. More than 800 people died in the summer of 1987when a heat wave and heavy smog hit Athens, one of Europe'smost polluted capitals.                                                                                                          DRUGS, GUNS ON RISE IN CANADA                                                                                                          Illicit drugs and guns are rapidly spilling into Canada.The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said that in the 20 monthsthrough last month, it seized four tons of cocaine, more thanin the previous four years, and confiscated 105 tons ofmarijuana, nearly double that in the previous 15 years. Manysmugglers use eastern Canadian seaports as a back door fordeliveries in the U.S. Authorities also noted a new trend ofhigh-caliber guns and urban drug-related shootouts.                                                                                                          CAPITAL IDEAS FOR JAPAN                                                                                                          The idea of transferring national government functions outof Tokyo drew considerable support from Japanese businessleaders surveyed by the Federation of Japanese EconomicOrganizations, called Keidanren.   The March survey of presidents of 377 Keidanren membercompanies, reported by the Kyodo news agency, showed 41% ofthe executives favored spreading out government functions and35% advocated moving the capital out of Tokyo. But 60% of therespondents were unwilling to move their businesses out ofTokyo.   Drawbacks of centralized government in Tokyo, the pollfound, included high land prices, rush-hour trafficcongestion and a housing shortage.   Of those favoring the scattering of government functions,70% said central agencies, such as the Finance Ministry andthe Ministry of International Trade and Industry, ought torelocate. Moving the parliament was backed by 64% ofrespondents, government-related institutions by 55%, and thesupreme court by 41%. But 71% objected to the idea ofrelocating the Imperial Palace.
