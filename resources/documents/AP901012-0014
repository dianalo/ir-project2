One would rid Europe of thousands of tanks, airplanes,antiaircraft artillery pieces and armored troop carriers. Most ofthe cuts would be in Soviet weapons.   The other pact would trim U.S. and Soviet long-range nuclearmissiles by about 30 percent overall. Hundreds of warheads would bescrapped under tight supervision.   The European treaty is the most comprehensive arms controlaccord in history. The U.S.-Soviet strategic arms reduction accord,meanwhile, deals with the deadliest weapons and, at 400 to 500pages, is of unprecedented length.   Bush predicted the conventional weapons treaty would be ready bylast June at the latest. It looks like it will be ready inmid-November. The heads of the 16 North Atlantic TreatyOrganization countries and the six Warsaw Pact nations will signthe treaty in Paris at a glittering summit meeting.   Bush hoped to sign the START accord with Soviet PresidentMikhail S. Gorbachev in Moscow in December. There is a slim chanceof that. U.S. officials say early next year is more likely.   Deadlines are not the main consideration. Harnessing the race inconventional and nuclear weapons, once a visionary dream, is aboutto become a reality.   Incredibly, the historic development has not captured thepublic's imagination. One reason is that the end of the Cold Waralready has soothed nuclear war nerves. Gorbachev is committed towithdrawing many of the tanks to be cut under the treaty, alongwith the troops that accompany them. Bush has ordered more modestcuts.   The Conventional Forces in Europe treaty will make cutbackslegally binding, however. And it will establish a framework foreven deeper reductions later on.   Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet ForeignMinister Eduard A. Shevardnadze cleared the last roadblocks in NewYork last week. These involved limits on land-based airplanes andverification procedures against cheating.   The two officials were unable, however, to resolve the remainingdifferences in the strategic arms reduction treaty. The four keyones are:   -The restrictions to be imposed on transfers to allies ofweapons barred under the treaty. This mostly involves U.S. nuclearsubmarine technology for Britain.   -The restrictions to be imposed on improving the Soviet SS-18intercontinental ballistic missiles.   -Whether the Soviet Backfire bomber is to be classified as along-range weapon under the treaty and made subject, therefore, tolimitations.   -Procedures for verifying the destruction of the bombers,submarines and missiles outlawed under the treaty.   Baker indicated last Friday that his talks with Shevardnadzetripped over the transfer issue and that the SS-18 and Backfireproblems could be settled once what arms controllers callnon-circumvention is cleared up.   ``In every nuclear negotiation the Soviets press us oncooperation with Britain and they have acceded ultimately everytime,'' a U.S. official said Thursday. ``Personally I am optimisticthat we'll settle this one.''   The Backfire bomber also has dogged U.S.-Soviet nuclear armstalks for a long time.   The Soviets insist the weapon is of medium-range. The UnitedStates insists the Backfire can span oceans and should berestricted both in range and in number.   The solution may be an agreement outside the treaty in which theSoviets volunteer to curb Backfire.   The SS-18 issue causes the most concern among conservatives inCongress. Some were ready to crucify Baker a few months ago when hetentatively agreed to some tests of the missile, the deadliest inthe Soviet arsenal.   The Soviets already have agreed to cut their SS-18 stockpile inhalf - from 308 to 154. The question is at what point improvementsin the existing SS-18 amount to creation of an illegal new weapon.   The official, who gave The Associated Press a progress reportunder conditions of anonymity, cautioned: ``I would not downgradethe importance of the specifics of verification.''   Among the tough items are the procedures for inspecting missileplants to guard against the production of illegal weapons.   ``They require long hours and a lot of work and focus, but thatdoesn't mean it's impossible,'' the official said.   ---   EDITOR'S NOTE: Barry Schweid reports on arms control and otherU.S.-Soviet issues for The Associated Press.</TEXT></DOC>
