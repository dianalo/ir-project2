Non-carbon-based, maybe, but not artificial.andP;  If we come upwith a machine that thinks, that intelligence will be real, if almostcertainly different.andP;  Such a machine will also be self-aware, although theshape and nature of that awareness will also be very different from ours.andP;  (Irecommend When Harlie was One by David Gerrold for a definitive discussion ofthis point.)andM;Our AI research can be taken as successful at just that point where weproduce something a lot different and smarter than we are.andP;  We will have trueAI when we have a machine that can (and will) disagree with us.andP;  And in thislies much of the fear and trembling with which many people still approachcomputers.andP;  There's always the possibility that such a machine might not onlydisagree with us -- it might not even like us.andM;It amazes me that many of the same people who feel this way about machineswill produce children with frightening insouciance.andP;  There's a strong analogyto be made between raising kids and developing true AI.andP;  Both start with onlythe information we adults give them.andP;  Both have (or should have) a built-in``associative engine'' that enables them to correlate and categorizeinformation, giving rise to new information.andP;  Both have the potential ofgrowing far beyond -- and  of turning on -- their creators.andP;  (Arthur C.andO;Clarke's Childhood's End is of interest in this context.)andM;If developing theoretical AI is akin to raising and educating a very brightchild, creating expert systems is more like toilet training -- or liketeaching chimpanzees to use sign language.andP;  It may be useful, but it'scomparatively uninteresting.andP;  And while there  are more expert systems inplace than there are self-conscious machines, a look around the AAAI show anda glance through the current literature indicate that neither side can claimsuccess.andM;(There's certainly a case to be made for viewing the computer modeling ofhuman intelligence as just another expert system.andP;  Unfortunately, it's asystem in which there are no true experts.) BACK TO THE FLOOR, CHETandM;However, there were some faint glimmers of hope for the future at AAAI.andP;  Forone thing, Apple had a booth there for the first time.andP;  And if any computercan break through the barrier of distrust, it will  be something like theMacintosh, with its easy accessibility and  (sorry, Mr.andP;  Sculley) its air ofsheer fun.andP;  Your Mac may infuriate, but it doesn't intimidate.andP;  The conceptalone of AI is daunting enough without having to pursue it via a recalcitrantand cranky computer.andM;The Apple booth wasn't the only place with Macs in evidence.andP;  They were allover the place.andP;  (Well, not in the Hewlett-Packard booth, maybe, but you getthe idea.) Apple was trumpeting the message that, whatever you wanted to doin artificial intelligence or any other area, they had the platform for it.andO;And if they didn't have it yet, they would, as soon as they knew what wasneeded.andP;  I hate to say it, but Apple may well be on the right track.andM;The Mac, with its unprejudiced access to just about every other computer fromPC to neural net, is an excellent front-end machine for AI work.andP;  TheKnowledge Systems Labs at Stanford University has already put a number ofMac/MicroExplorer combinations to work this way.andP;  The Mac's much-touted shortlearning curve means users can devote their time to AI development ratherthan to learning the quirks of various operating systems.andM;The Mac has made a more immediate mark in AI development, too.andP;  Prolog, aprogramming language for artificial intelligence, is gaining greateracceptance due to Macintosh implementations.andP;  LISP will probably remain theAI programming language of choice; there are several excellentimplementations of that language, too, for the  Mac.andP;  (See ``ArtificialIntelligence from A to I'' in the December '88 issue for more details.)andM;Let's give computers the really difficult problems to solve.andP;  An idiot savantcan crunch numbers.andP;  The worst that can happen is that it comes up with``42.'' And on the positive side, maybe the Knowledge Navigator, or somethinglike it, will actually appear.andP;  APPLE COMES OF AGEandM;The Knowledge Navigator is Apple's mythical ultimate personal computer,featured in many a visionary promo video often accompanying Messrs.andP;  Sculley,Gassee, et al at trade shows and conferences.andP;  About the size of a Toshiba1000, it opens like a book and can do everything from reminding you ofappointments -- verbally -- to linking you into worldwide databases.andP;  (Itseems to be particularly au  courant about anything to do with the AmazonRain Forest.) It's something like the Hitchhiker's Guide crossed with a goodsecretary.andM;Apple showed all four Knowledge Navigator videos in its booth at AAAI.andO;Within an hour of the first showing, people had rearranged all the chairs inrows and were all but salivating at the screen.andP;  You could hardly ever findan empty chair.andP;  They were also buttonholing any Apple rep they could findanywhere.andP;  (I conducted an interview with Harald Striepe from Apple in astairwell.) Everyone wanted to know where they could buy ``that machine.''andM;It's a long way from a ``toy computer'' to the easy assumption that you canproduce the Knowledge Navigator out of a hat.andP;  This, more than anything else,tells me that Apple and the Macintosh have arrived -- in the minds ofconsumers, at any rate.andP;  We're that much closer to turning sci-fi's``artificial'' visions into reality.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
