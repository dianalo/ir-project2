The two firms, ad agency Young andamp; Rubicam Inc. and public relations concern Ruder Finn andamp; Rotman Inc. confirmed the investigation after an article outlining it appeared Sunday in the Stamford, Conn., Advocate. The article said &quot;five or six&quot; executives are suspected of paying more than $1 million in kickbacks for the $40 million in contracts from the Jamaican Tourist Board between 1981 and 1985. The kickbacks allegedly were paid to Jamaican government officials.    According to the article, the investigation stemmed from a tip by a Westport, Conn., writer, Robin Moore, author of the best-selling novel &quot;The Green Berets.&quot; Mr. Moore was convicted of tax evasion in 1986, and has been cooperating with federal authorities. The article said Mr. Moore is believed to have hosted meetings between the firms' executives and Jamaican officials at his New York and Connecticut homes.    The executives weren't identified. The investigation is being carried out by the U.S. attorney's office in New Haven, Conn.    A spokesman for Young andamp; Rubicam, the nation's largest ad agency, said the investigation has been going on for more than a year. &quot;We have cooperated fully&quot; with authorities, he said. &quot;We know of no evidence of any wrongdoing and we don't believe anything improper has occurred.&quot; Young andamp; Rubicam created the &quot;Come Back to Jamaica&quot; campaign.    Amy Binder, a Ruder Finn executive vice president, said, &quot;As far as we know, it's an investigation of some former employees.&quot; Most of the executives who worked on the Jamaica account have since moved to Greycom, a public relations unit of Grey Advertising Inc., and they took the account with them, she said.    In Kingston, Jamaica, Carrole Guntley, director of Jamaica's tourism board, said her office conducted an internal investigation into allegations of kickbacks and found &quot;no irregularities&quot; in its dealings with the U.S. companies. She confirmed that Young andamp; Rubicam does advertising work for Jamaica and that Ruder Finn did public relations work until &quot;a little over a year ago.&quot; She declined to say why Ruder Finn no longer works for the tourism agency.    Ms. Guntley declined to comment further, except to say that U.S. investigators hadn't contacted her office. </TEXT></DOC>
