Before 1987, the United States did the most business with SouthAfrica, which has been condemned internationally for the apartheidrace policy that preserves power for the 5 million whites anddenies the 26 million blacks a voice in national affairs.   Finance Ministry figures released Tuesday showed two-way tradewas down for the second consecutive month because of a sharpdecline in imports, but exports to South Africa remained strong.   As other countries imposed sanctions on South Africa to protestapartheid and saw their trade figures shrink, Japan let itscompanies fill the gap and has been criticized for doing so.   Some Japanese newspapers said trade was not really declining,but Foreign Ministry spokesman Yoshifumi Matsuda told reportersThursday they should concentrate on yen-based trade figures ratherthan those expressed in dollars.   In dollars, two-way trade was up 13.3 percent to $2.2 billionfor the first six months of 1988, compared with the same 1987period, but in yen the value dropped 3 percent to 272 billion, withthe decline starting in April.   ``We do expect that the new trend after April will continue assuch,'' Matsuda said.   Japan also renewed its call on South Africa to release NelsonMandela, the imprisoned leader of the African National Congress,Matsuda announced.   In addition, he said Japan has gone beyond most Westerncountries in breaking diplomatic ties with South Africa andprohibiting direct investment.   Japan's bilateral trade with South Africa also has declined forthe past two months when expressed in dollars. The $325 million oftrade in June was 14.5 percent below June 1987, the FinanceMinistry reported. The decline was largely attributed to imports,which plunged 26.6 percent to $158.1 million in June from a yearago.   Exports continued growing, though not as rapidly as six monthsago. In June, Japan exported $166.9 million worth of goods to SouthAfrica, 1.4 percent more than a year ago. But for the first sixmonths of this year, exports soared 45.3 percent to $1.14 billion,according to the Finance Ministry's customs clearance statistics.   In 1987, Japan's trade with South Africa totaled $4.27 billion,a 19 percent increase from the previous year that provedembarrassing.   Foreign Minister Susuke Uno asked Japanese business leadersearly this year to reduce the trade and suggested the Ministry ofInternational Trade and Industry coordinate a guideline forJapanese companies to follow.   The powerful Federation of Economic Organizations, known asKeidanren, which consists of some 1,000 major Japanesecorporations, said the Keidanren is not in a position to controlits members' business activities.   Analysts attributed the recent decline in imports to decisionsby several supermarket chains and department stores to stop sellingSouth African products.</TEXT></DOC>
