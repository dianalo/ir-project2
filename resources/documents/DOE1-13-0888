Fromthe data were retrieved simultaneous mixing ratio profiles of ozone,water vapor, nitric acid, and CFC-12 between 12 and 35 km. The retrievedozone and water vapor profiles were compared with concurrent in-situmeasurements with electrochemical concentration cells (ECCs) and frost-pointhygrometers, respectively. The retrieved ozone profile was in good agreementwith the correlative data. The retrieved values of water vapor mixingratio, while close in magnitude to the correlative measurements, differedin their altitude dependence. Although there was no concurrent in-situdata for nitric acid and CFC-12, the retrieved profiles were consistentwith measurements in the literature.</TEXT></DOC>
