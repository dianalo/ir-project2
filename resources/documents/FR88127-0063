The Commission initiated this proceeding on April 10, 1987, (52 FR 15986;May 1, 1987), with the release of a Fourth Notice of Inquiry (NOI), CCDocket No. 79-184. That NOI stated that the Commission sought to developpolicies and guidelines for the construction and use of cable and satellitetransmission facilities to meet demands for common carrier service in theNorth Atlantic Region during the 1991-2000 period. The Commission requestedthe United States International Service Carriers (USISCs) and Comsat tosubmit planning data including traffic forecasts, available technologicalfacilities options, service reliability information, cost information andalternative facilities plans which assume use of different facilities andvary the time of introduction of new facilities. 2. The service carriers submitted a single plan which calls for the introductionof a TAT-9 optical fiber cable in 1991, landing in the United States, Canada,the United Kingdom, France and Spain. The TAT-9 cable will employ 1.55micron laser technology on two transatlantic fiber optic pairs, each operatingat a speed of 565 Mb/s and will also utilize wet multiplex technology.The proposed cable will cost approximately $400 million, plus $5 millionfor land and buildings and $48 million for interest during construction.3. The service carriers argue the need to implement TAT-9 by October, 1991,on the basis of: (1) Their projections of increased demand in the NorthAtlantic Region, attributed in particular to anticipated growth of widebanddigital services; (2) the need for compatible digital restoration capabilityfor TAT-8; (3) providing digital connectivity with the MAT-2 and EMOS-1cables, thereby extending the system's configuration into the MediterraneanRegion; (4) improving media and route diversity to points served by theTAT-9 cable; and (5) promoting intramodal and intermodal competition betweenand among cable and satellite entities in the North Atlantic Region.4. Comsat submitted three alternative plans which do not comtemplate theneed for additional cable facilities during the planning period. Comsatasserts that the cable and satellite facilities already authorized willbe sufficient to carry all projected traffic in the North Atlantic at leastinto the mid-1990's. The plan differ only in the number of follow-on-satellitsthat will be launched when the INTELSAT V series reach the end of theiruseful lives. The number of satellites to be deployed varies from six underPlan 1 to five under Plan 2 and four under Plan 3. 5. In evaluation the alternative plans and relpy comments submitted bythe U.S. carriers and Comsat, the Commission applied the following criteria:demand flexibility, cost, service reliability, foreign correspondent acceptance,digital connectively, furtherance of the Commission's pro-competitive policies,satisfaction of defense communications requirements and other relevantfactors. 6. After evaluating the planning data submitted, the Commission tentativelyconcluded that introduction of a TAT-9 cable as early as 1991 would bein the public interest. Although adequate demand flexibility (i.e., theability of a particular facility or combination of transmission facilitiesto accommodate unforecasted increases in demand) appears to be providedby existing and planned facilities for a substantial portion of the planningperiod, the Commision noted that some uncertainty exists as to whetherthe Department of Defense's (DoD) substantial circuit projections wereincluded in the forecasts submitted by the service carriers. In addition,the service carriers note the importance of the unique capabilities offiber optic technology in meeting a perceived demand for digitial terrestrialservices. The Commission invited further comment on DoD's circuit projectionsand the degree to which planned fiber optic cable facilities will be sufficientto meet the demand for digital terrestrial services. 7. Desite the uncertainty as to demand flexibility, the Commission reliedon several other factors which justify introduction of a TAT-9 cable asearly as 1991. Specifically, the Commission noted that introduction ofthe TAT-9 fiber optic cable will: (1) Provide restoration of the TAT-8optical fiber cable and other facilities while increasing both media andpath diversity; (2) provide digital connectively with the MAT-2 and EMOS-1cable systems, resulting in an integrated digital network between NorthAmerica and the Mediterranean; (3) promote national security interestsby satisfying the operational requirements of the Department of Defensein the Atlantic and Mediterranean Regions; (4) provide further technologicalinnovations, thereby providing users with the widest range of technologicalalternatives to meet their specific service requirements; and (5) furtherenhance intermodal and intramodal competition between and among cable andsatellite entities. The plan also has the approval of the carriers' foreigncorrespondents. 8. The Commission reached no tentative conclusion on the specific configurationfor the TAT-9 cable, particularly with regard to the question of whethera Portugal landing point should be provided in addition to the other threeEuropean landing points. The Commisison noted that there was insufficientinformation pertaining to INTELSAT follow-on-satellites to reach any tentativeconclusion regarding the number, capacity and parameters of such satellitesto be deployed. Finally, since the Commission did not reach any conclusionson circuit distribution guidelines, that issue will be resolved in thecontext of the circuit distribution proceeding in CC Docket No. 87-67.9. The action contained herein has been analyzed with respect to the PaperworkReduction Act of 1980 and found to impose no new or modified informationcollection requirements on the public. Implementation of any new or modifiedrequirements will be subject to approval by the Office of Management andBudget as prescribed by the Act. <ITAG tagnum="84">Ordering Clauses </ITAG>10.
