(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Pat Robertson formally suspended hismoribund presidential campaign Monday, applauding runaway victorGeorge Bush but saying he was not ready to hand over his relativehandful of Republican convention delegates.   The former television evangelist said he would return to theChristian Broadcasting Network, which has suffered in his absence,and would establish a new Christian political action committee.   Asked about his own political future, he said, ``That remains amoot question until the 1988 election. I hope Mr. Bush is electedand then re-elected again in 1992.''   The high point of the Robertson campaign came early, in the Feb.8 caucuses in Iowa where he finished ahead of Bush in second placebehind Kansas Sen. Bob Dole.   When it came to open primaries, Robertson's relatively small butcommitted ``invisible army'' was less effective. He finished lastin New Hampshire on Feb. 16, third in South Carolina March 5, andthen was trounced in the March 8 Super Tuesday primaries in whichhe had hoped to do well ``in my backyard.''   Voters in his home state of Virginia placed him a distant thirdbehind Bush and Dole on Super Tuesday.   Following the March 15 Illinois primary, in which he got lessthan 10 percent of the vote, he scaled back his campaign toconcentrate only on caucus states. He talked less about beingpresident and more about being the conservative voice that wouldspeak for a conservative platform. But he kept his formal candidacyalive long after any chance of winning was gone.   ``I will work to ensure that the 1988 platform follows closelythe conservative principles of our 1984 platform,'' he said Monday.That platform called for prayer in school, opposed abortion andsupported ``family values.''   ``I call upon my friends and supporters to continue theirsplendid efforts, because our struggle is not finished, it is justbeginning,'' Robertson told reporters outside his home on the CBNUniversity campus. He was accompanied by his wife Dede and son Tim.   ``I suspend my candidacy ... but I do not now nor will I eversuspend my advocacy of conservative and moral principles,'' saidRobertson, who campaigned in 34 states and won 46 delegates afterspending $22 million. Bush has more than 1,300 delegates.   ``I will take my delegates to New Orleans,'' Robertson said.   His new political action committee, Americans for the Republic,will support and train conservative Christian candidates and willbe staffed by Robertson campaign workers.   Another task Robertson faces is shoring up the ailing CBN, whichhas faced a big decrease in revenues since Robertson left the airlast fall to begin his campaign. The network laid off 645 employeeslast year.   ``After today, I hope we never again have to lay off people,''Robertson said of a new round of layoffs on Monday. He declined tosay how many employees were let go.   Robertson will replace his son as CBN's chief executive officer.   During the presidential race, Robertson frequently criticizedBush, even suggesting that the vice president's campaign hadengineered the timing of the Jimmy Swaggart scandal to detract fromRobertson. But he said Monday, ``George Bush has won thenomination. I applaud his magnificent effort and warmly endorse hiscandidacy.''   Robertson's campaign was marked by striking charges, including:   _That there are Russian nuclear missiles in Cuba, an allegationthe Reagan administration as well as Fidel Castro denied.   _That the State Department ignored intelligence gathered by CBNpeople in Beirut about the location of hostages, an allegation thatbrought public skepticism from President Reagan.   Robertson's campaign specialized in mobilizing politicalneophytes from charismatic and fundamentalist churches to take overlocal party operations.   ``There is an enterprise the Lord set me on a year or so ago _running for president,'' Robertson told a Denver congregationEaster Sunday. ``Out of what seems to be a defeat we are laying afoundation for a great victory for this nation. It may not be in1988 ... but I am not going to quit. That is his plan for me andfor this nation.''</TEXT></DOC>
