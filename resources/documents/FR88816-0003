The originaldefinition of home loan, which was adopted in 1978, has expanded in scopebeyond its original intent with the development and rapidly increasinguse of secured, open-end, home-equity loan products. This amendment bringsmore uniformity to fair housing lending data requirements among federalbank regulators and should result in administrative cost savings for boththe FDIC and state nonmember banks.

It appliesto all state-chartered banks which are insured by the FDIC but which donot belong to the Federal Reserve System (``state nonmember banks''). Part 338 implements the Fair Housing Act (FHA), 42 U.S.C. 3533(a), 3535(c),andamp; 3601-19 and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act of 1974 (``ECOA'') (15U.S.C. 1691-91f), in accordance with the Federal Reserve Board's (FRB)Regulation B, 12 CFR Part 202. Section 338.4 also spells out the monitoringresponsibilities delegated to the FDIC in andSection; 202.13 of RegulationB. Part 338 has two main purposes, each related to the ECOA and to the FHA.The ECOA forbids banks (and all other creditors) from engaging in unlawfuldiscrimination in making loans generally and commands the Federal ReserveBoard (FRB) to write ECOA's implementing regulation. 15 U.S.C. 1691 and1691b. The FRB's Regulation B specifies data-gathering rules for most consumerloans. But, in the case of loans related to the purchase or refinancingof the borrower's dwelling, the FRB's rules (Section 202.13(d)) specifythat sister federal financial regulatory agencies have the <T3>option </T3>of requiring the institutions they supervise to complywith the requirements contained in Parts (a), (b) and (c) of andSection;202.13 as written <T3>or </T3>of substituting a monitoring program of their own which imposesrequirements that include, at a minimum, these same requirements. See 12CFR 202.13. In exercising this option, the FDIC adopted Section 4 of Part338 in 1978. The FHA forbids banks (and certain other creditors) from engagingin unlawful discrimination in making housing related loans. 42 U.S.C. 3605.Part 338 helps to provide the monitoring information and certain otherinformation needed to enforce that prohibition. The existing Part 338 requires state nonmember banks to collect certaininformation from all applicants for a ``home loan.'' Part 338 originallydefined a home loan as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">``Home loan'' means any extension of credit relating to: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) The purchase or construction of or the refinancing for a dwellingwhich is or will be comprised of one to four residential units, at leastone of which the applicant intends to occupy as a principal residence,and which secures or will secure the extension of credit; or </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) The improvement, repair, or maintenance of a dwelling which iscomprised of one to four residential units, at least one of which the applicantintends to occupy as a principal residence, and which secures or will securethe extension of credit. 12 CFR 338.1(f).</ITAG>Currently, every state nonmember bank that receives a home loan applicationmust request and retain information regarding the applicant's race/nationalorigin, sex, marital status and age (hereafter referred to as monitoringinformation). 12 CFR 338.4(a)(1)(i) andamp; (2)(i). State nonmember bankswith assets exceeding $10 million and having an office in a primary metropolitanstatistical area, metropolitan statistical area, or consolidated metropolitanstatistical area must collect additional data. The extra data include,but are not limited to, the applicant's total assets and liabilities, thepurchase price or current market value of the property, and the property'scensus tract. <T3>Id. </T3>338.4(a)(2)(ii). Certain state nonmember banks that collectthe additional information must also record monitoring information on alog-sheet of home loan applications on a branch-by-branch basis. <T3>Id. </T3>338.4(a)(2)(iv). A state nonmember bank must ask for this monitoring information duringthe initial contact with the home loan applicant. <T3>Id. </T3>338.4(a)(2)(ii) andamp; (2)(iii)(A). The bank must retain theinformation on file for 25 months after notifying the applicant of theaction taken on the application. <T3>Id. </T3>338.4(c).<ITAG tagnum="84">FDIC Proposal </ITAG>On August 18, 1987 (52 FR 30928) the FDIC published for public commenta proposed rule to amend the definition of ``home loan''. The FDIC indicatedat that time that the proposed amendment, if approved by the FDIC Boardof Directors, would make necessary certain technical and conforming changesto eliminate language which would become superfluous to Part 338. The proposed rule presented was written as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">``Home loan'' means any extension of credit the primary purpose ofwhich is the purchase or construction of or the refinancing for a dwellingthat secures or will secure the extension of credit, which dwelling isor will be comprised of one to four residential units, at least one ofwhich the applicant intends to occupy as a principal residence.</ITAG>In order to conform more precisely to the wording in andSection;202.13 ofRegulation B, the following minor revisions in language have been made.<ITAG tagnum="21">``Home loan'' means any extension of credit the primary purpose ofwhich is the purchase, construction, or refinancing of a dwelling thatsecures or will secure the extension of credit, which dwelling is or willbe comprised of one to four residential units, at least one of which theapplicant intends to occupy as a principal residence.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Reasons for the Proposed Change </ITAG>In the published proposal, the FDIC cited three reasons for changing thedefinition of ``home loan'': (1) To bring the FDIC's data-gathering requirements into line with thoseof the Comptroller of the Currency (``OCC'') and the FRB. Neither agencyapplies the data-gathering requirements to loans made for improving, repairing,or maintaining the borrower's dwelling (herein referred to generally as``home improvement loans''). (2) To remove ``home equity'' loans from the FDIC's Part 338 data-gatheringrequirement. Home-equity loans are general-purpose, open-end loans securedby the borrower's dwelling. The FDIC does not believe that the FHA wasmeant to apply to loans of this kind, or that it is useful to distinguishhome-equity loans from other kinds of general purpose, open-end consumercredit. (3) To eliminate the FDIC recordkeeping requirements that have not provenuseful. Although the FDIC has monitored home improvement loans for severalyears, the number of complaints alleging unlawful discrimination in makingsuch loans has been very small. The primary reason for the proposal is to establish more uniformity withsimilar regulations of sister federal financial regulators. As stated inthe proposed rule, neither the OCC nor the FRB require lenders to obtainmonitoring information on home-equity loans for the purpose of home improvement,repair or maintenance. The OCC imposes the special monitoring informationrequirement only in the case of loans made ``for the purchase, permanentfinancing for construction, or the refinancing of the borrower's residence.''12 CFR 27.2(f). The FRB's parallel monitoring information requirement appliesonly to loans ``primarily for the purchase or refinancing'' of the borrower'sresidence. <T3>Id. </T3>202.13(a). On March 30, 1988 the FRB approved, after consideration of comments receivedfrom the public, the following revision to the <T3>Official Staff Commentary </T3>concerning the Regulation B andSection;202.13monitoring information collection requirements: ``An application for anopen-end home equity line of credit is not subject to this section [202.13]unless it is readily apparent to the creditor where the application istaken that the primary purpose of the line is for the purchase or refinancingof a principal dwelling.'' With most home-equity type loans thus exempted,a non-uniformity between the FRB and the FDIC requirements becomes conspicuous.Without FDIC proposed changes, state nonmember bankers may mistakenly believethey are in compliance with existing Part 338 when they comply with theopen-end, home-equity loan requirements of Regulation B. Due to the time and care necessary to review and, where necessary to recordexisting Part 338 monitoring information and additional data collectingrequirements, state nonmember banks are placed at a competitive disadvantage.In 1986, according to aggregate Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (``HMDA'')data, approximately 29% (107,458) of secured home loans originated by FDICsupervised banks were home improvement loans. Generally, home-equity loansare not included in the HMDA improvement reporting. Home-equity loans continue to be the fastest-growing U.S. consumer loanproduct. At the end of 1987, 32 percent of commercial banks offered suchloans, representing borrowing by consumers of $30.4 billion (see ``HomeEquity Lines of Credit'' by Glenn B. Canner, James T. Fergus, and CharlesA. Luckett, p. 367, <T3>The Federal Reserve Bulletin, </T3>June, 1988). A survey of users indicatedthat 25% intended a first use of the home-equity account to be for homeimprovement; 19% indicated a later use for this purpose (Canner, <T3>et al., </T3>p. 365). The authors reported (pp. 361-362) that home-equityloans have become increasingly popular with borrowers because: (1) Of certaintax revisions affecting the deductibility of interest paid on consumercredit; (2) finance rates are more attractive than for alternative loanproducts; and (3) the intensive marketing programs initiated by lenders,including price concessions. Such loans have become increasingly popularwith lenders because: (1) they carry a relatively low risk of loss fromdefault (i.e., the loan is secured by the borrower's home); (2) home-equityloans reduce further loan origination costs and help to establish a long-termrelationship with the borrower; (3) variable-rate pricing reduces lossrisk; and (4) such customers tend to be of higher-income and of highereducational achievement than for homeowners without home-equity accounts(Canner, <T3>et al., </T3>pp. 364 and 368). The FDIC has come to recognize that including open-end, home-equity loans(which have as their purpose home improvement) within the scope of Part338 causes special problems for both consumers and bankers. For example,both bankers and borrowers generally regard these lines of credit as avariety of consumer loans_albeit with a higher degree of security for thelender_rather than as residential real estate loans. While it is comparativelyeasy to determine the purpose of a closed-end loan at the time the loanis made and to segregate home loans from other loans at that time, thisis not as easy in the case of open-end, home-equity loans. For such loans,banks do not typically place any constraints on the intended use of theloan proceeds; borrowers want the funds for a variety of purposes, oftenyet to be determined. In short, the borrower's implied <T3>primary </T3>purpose in taking out a home-equity loan is simply togain additional liquidity. This remains true even if the borrower happensto draw upon it to reduce or pay off a mortgage loan. To require loan applicantsto identify a purpose for open-end credit other than that of accessinga line of credit when the purpose has no bearing on the loan decision isconfusing to such applicants. Bankers have reported to the FDIC that the process of requesting the monitoringinformation is combersome and confusing in the case of home-equity loansand tends to deter consumers from supplying the information voluntarily.The loan application must indicate that the monitoring information is beingrequested by the federal government for compliance with statutes that prohibitcreditors from discriminating against applicants on certain bases. Butat the same time, the current application must also explain that the monitoringinformation is only requested when the home-equity loan is a home improvementtype loan. In effect, to avoid supplying monitoring information, borrowersare given an incentive to avoid labeling a home-equity loan as a home improvementloan. In addition to the foregoing, the FDIC has found the current data-monitoringrequirements to be only marginally useful in the case of home-equity loans.Banks generally advertise these loans in the media, and offer to mail thecustomer a loan application on request. This procedure reduces the likelihoodof certain types of unlawful discrimination e.g., race and sex discriminationbased on visual observation. Imposing the data monitoring requirementscould conceivably be counterproductive in some instances, since the lenderwould not always otherwise be aware of the applicant's race or sex.<ITAG tagnum="84">Principal Issues Raised in the Comment Letters</ITAG>The following were suggested as issues for comment in the request for publiccomment regarding the FDIC's proposed revisions to Part 338:<T3>Issue 1:</T3> From all interested parties, general comments regardingthe proposal to delete home improvement, repair and maintenance loans frominclusion under the definitions of section 338.1(f) and specifically anycomments which would support or challenge the ``Reasons for the Proposal.''<T3>Issue 2:</T3> From the standpoint of consumer and civil rights groupsand banks, comments would be helpful regarding perceived possible effectson bank compliance with fair housing lending laws of omitting home improvement,repair, and maintenance loans from the scope of Part 338.<T3>Issue 3:</T3> From the standpoint of banks, comments on the followingwould be helpful:a. What specific problems, if any, have banks had in complying with theinformation recording requirements of Part 338 regarding home improvement,repair and maintenance loan applicants for both secured closed-end andopen-end (i.e., home equity) loans?b. How many hours or staff time are estimated to be required in a yearto comply with the information recording requirements for home improvement,repair and maintenance loan applicants for both secured closed-end andopen-end loans? What are the estimated dollar costs? Please explain theway in which these estimates were computed.The FDIC received 73 public comment letters, 69 of which were in supportof the proposed amendment and four of which were opposed. Of these 73,64 were from financial institutions (with only one opposed to the proposal);six were from trade associations (none opposed); one was from an agencyof the federal government (opposed); and two were from community advocacygroups (both opposed). No new documented information concerning the proposedchanges was received.<ITAG tagnum="84">Evaluation of Comments</ITAG>Issue 1: Narrowing the Definition of Home LoanOne opposing respondent replied that the narrowing of the defined scopeof loans covered for purposes of recordkeeping does not fully reflect theintent of Congress in Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 (the FairHousing Act). This respondent also stated that the subject proposal, ifadopted, would give rise to substantial confusion regarding the natureof discriminatory financing activities prohibited under section 805 ofthe Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3605). The FDIC believes neither of thosetwo points to be the case. First, open-end, home-equity loans did not generallyexist in 1968 when the Fair Housing Act was enacted. Secondly, the recordkeepingrequirements of Part 338 are, in point of fact, a substitute monitoringprogram adopted under ECOA's Regulation B, andSection; 202.13. Within andSection;338.4(d) it is stated that a bank collecting the data in compliance withandSection; 338.4 will be in compliance with the recordkeeping requirementsof andSection; 202.13 of Regulation B. To the extent this is the case, theextant proposal is not an explicit or implicit comment upon the natureor scope of discriminatory financing activities prohibited under the FairHousing Act. Section 338.4 speaks primarily to ECOA and secondarily tothe Fair Housing Act.Another respondent writing in opposition to the proposed change, statedthat since home-equity loans are secured by real estate, homes owned byminorities or located in older or predominantly minority neighborhoodscould be viewed as of less value or less marketable than comparable propertieslocated elsewhere. This respondent argued that the lender's decision asto whether or not to extend a home-equity loan and, if so, on what terms,is based on the lender's assessment of the value and marketability of theunderlying real estate. This respondent contended that because home-equityloans are based on homes, they are much more comparable to mortgages thanthey are to other forms of open-end credit. Another respondent agreed withthis view and further stated that a failure to provide equity lines ina particular area may give rise to claims of redlining and denials of servicesin connection with dwellings under Section 804 and 805 of the Fair HousingAct.The FDIC believes that secured, open-end, home-equity loans having an acknowledgedpurpose of home improvement are more akin to traditional consumer lendingthan to mortgage lending and can be monitored and enforced according toprocedures that the FRB mandates and the FDIC uses for other consumer loans.The FRB, which has rulemaking authority for ECOA and periodically updatesRegulation B, relying in part on the public comment process, has recentlyelected to generally exclude these categories (i.e., home-equity and homeimprovement) from the scope of the monitoring information categories justas it has for non-secured credit generally. Also, to the extent that open-end,home-equity loans are not easily differentiated by purpose (since the primarypurpose of such loans is liquidity), the FDIC believes the home improvement-typecategories should be deleted from the scope of the definitions of homeloan.Another opposing respondent indicated that significant lending discriminationexists with regard to home-improvement and home-equity loans. This respondentcited one case where a lender denied home-equity loan applicants or offeredreduced loan amounts (relative to the applicant's equity in the propertyand relative to the bank's advertised loan policy) allegedly on the basisof race.The FDIC has no record of any state non member bank engaging in such practices.The FDIC maintains a constant watch for evidence of discrimination throughvarious means including: (1) A comprehensive complaint processing program;(2) an effective bank examination program which evaluates the complianceby banks with fair lending laws: and (3) a toll-free number which creditapplicants and others may call during workdays. Despite this comprehensivecompliance monitoring system, no evidence of any such discrimination hasbeen found. The FDIC believes that if racial or economic redlining wereto be occurring regarding home-equity loans, such would likely be evidentfor home purchase loans as well. Certain banks (see andSection; 338.4(a)(2)(iv))must keep the log-sheets of home purchase, refinance, and constructionloan applicants (along with HMDA reports which include home improvementloans), to assist in the identification of possible geographically-baseddiscriminatory patterns. The FDIC examiners will continue to review theserecords. Rejected applications for secured, home improvement-type loans,including home-equity loans, are generally easily accessible since theyusually are collected in file drawers together. All evidence of prohibiteddiscriminatory policies and practices brought to the attention of appropriateregulatory authorities is investigated.The FDIC has provided for more comprehensive monitoring information requirementsthan other regulators in the past. This practice has resulted in on-goingcost burdens with few benefits. Limited financial resources dictate that,within the mandates of pertinent laws, the FDIC's focus now be concentratedon established problem areas. Should a future problem in either of theareas of secured home-improvement or home-equity loans become apparent,the FDIC would consider redrafting its regulations to effectively dealwith such problems.One opposing respondent commented that, since home-equity lines of creditare a relatively new phenomenon, it is not yet clear whether these loansmay be subject to prohibited bases discrimination, or to what extent. Thisrespondent argued that this type of loan should therefore be included inthe FDIC data collection system. This same respondent also suggested thatin order to avoid borrower confusion with regard to which type of loanrequires a request for monitoring data, that such data be requested for<T3>all </T3>home-equity loans, regardless of the use to which the loanproceeds will be put.This suggestion is beyond the scope of this proposal and is also beyondthe rulemaking authority of the FDIC. The subject proposal only deals withloans which have a home improvement type purpose since, under existingPart 338 requirements, only home-equity loans for home purchase, construction,refinance and home improvement-type purposes are not covered; home-equityloans for other purposes are <T3>not </T3>covered since this is expressly prohibited by andSection; 202.5of Regulation B. Section 202.13 of this same regulation requires the collectionof pertinent information for monitoring purposes <T3>only </T3>where a creditor receives an application for credit primarilyfor the purchase or refinancing of dwelling to be occupied by the applicantas a principal residence and where the extension of credit will be securedby the dwelling. While home-equity loans are relatively new, open-end consumercredit is not new and neither is secured credit. Because the FDIC has receivedno secured home improvement-type complaints during the previous three andone-half years (and only two such complaints in 1984, with no unlawfuldiscrimination found in either case), it has concluded that at least forthe present, the number of such problems does not support continuationof existing Part 338 coverage.One opposing respondent stated that complaints, or lack thereof, are notadequate evidence of fair lending compliance or noncompliance. The FDICdoes not base its reasoning for the subject proposal solely on a lack ofcomplaints. The FDIC has an effective and comprehensive fair lending complianceenforcement system in place. This system is founded on the FDIC complianceexamination program where banks are periodically evaluated and rated asto their performance, the large majority of which are consistently foundto be in compliance with all fair housing lending laws, regulations andrules. Whenever fair housing lending deficiences in policies and/or proceduresare found, they are corrected and closely monitored. In addition, anyonein the United States has instant access to the FDIC via a toll-free hotlineduring working hours to discuss possible bank/customer problems. Moreover,the Washington-based FDIC Fair Lending Analyst has reported receiving notelephone inquiries concerning home-equity loans for any purpose.An opposing respondent asserted that the lack of a large number of compliantsdoes not diminish the value of the monitoring information requested andfurther stated that the absence of such information was viewed as an impedimentto the investigation of individual compliants filed as well as in the determinationas to whether a financial institution is in compliance with nondiscriminationstatutes. This respondent also stated that the lack of such data on applicantsfor home improvement and home-equity loans will make it difficult to documentthat this type of financing for dwellings is available on a nondiscriminatorybasis. Another respondent stated opposition to the deletion of home improvementloans from the monitoring information requirements since such informationwas viewed as ``minimal and essential to the investigation of lending discriminationallegations''.Currently, Part 338 requires the following monitoring information for homeimprovement-type loans: Race/national origin, sex, marital status and age.For secured loans, Regulation B permits a creditor to ask marital status(Section 202.5 (d)(1)). Age is permitted to be asked generally (Section202.6(b)(2)(ie-iv)). Thus, for home-equity loans, this information is likelyto be present, even if the subject proposal were to be adopted, allowingcomparisons to be made on these bases. As regards the category of sex,obtaining a control grouping of opposite sex applicants is generally possibleusing first name identifiers. For national origin, as with sex, a similar,although not identical situation exists. As for the category of race, comparisonscould still be made on this basis in a general way since bank examinersuse HMDA reports, which include a listing, by census tract or county, ofhome purchase and home improvement loans. Examiners also have at hand theHMDA aggregation reports for Metropolitan Statistical Area(s) which canbe used as a comparative base-point to measure an approximate demand relativeto geographic location. Patterns can be deducted from such reports forthe discovery of discriminatory practices where groups of minotiry homeownersare unable to acquire home improvement loans. At times, deed transfer datacan also be accessed for comparative purposes.One respondent (opposed) stated that since the lenders the FDIC regulatesare commercial lenders, home improvement loans often represent a substantiallylarger portion of their housing related loans than do home purchase mortgageloans. Therefore, access to information on home improvement loans wouldbe critical for examiners to make an accurate determination as to the lender'scompliance with fair housing and fair lending laws. Without informationon these loans, examiners would be forced to determine compliance on thebasis of a relatively limited portion of the lender's housing related loanportfolio, i.e., mortgage loans.Again, the primary goal of the Part 338 proposed amendments is to bringthe FDIC rule requirements into greater uniformity with the requirementsof Regulation B and this regulation does not include requiring the recordingof monitoring data on home improvement loans. In addition, banks whichmay be engaging in illegal discrimination, either intentionally or unintentionallyrisk discovery through periodic compliance examination where examinersare expected to review a sample of rejected credit applications, with particularemphasis on applications from women and minorities. They are to determinewhether the information available in the records is consistent with andsupports the reasons for denial stated on the adverse action notices andthat the reasons for rejection are consistent with the bank's written and/ororal policies as previously determined and were applied consistently toboth minority and non-minority applicants.Issue 2: <T3>Effects on Bank Compliance with Fair Lending Laws:</T3>Generally, bankers view this change in definition as benefitting complianceefforts. Cited frequently by bank respondents was the highly competitivenature of the secured credit market along with the fact that home improvementloans enhance the value of the lender's collateral and thus are viewedas preferred lending risks. Also, applicants for such loans are generallymore financially established and more credit worthy than applicants forother consumer credit. However, one respondent opposed to the change indefinition, pointed out that discriminatory behavior is not based on logic.While this may be true, the FDIC has to date little evidence of a problemregarding illegal discrimination with regard to secured home improvementapplicants. In March of 1985, the FRB proposed revisions to RegulationB to include requiring the monitoring information requirements regardingcredit applications for the repair or improvement of the borrower's principalresidence. In the <T3>Final Rule </T3>preface, the FRB stated that they received 104 commentson this item of the proposed revision with over half of the commentersgenerally opposing the proposed change arguing, in part, burdensomeness.And finally, while one respondent opposed to the change stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">* * * since the equity lines are in part based upon the market valueof dwellings and are secured by the dwelling it is possible that failureto provide equity lines in particular areas may give rise to claims ofredlining and denials of services in connection with dwellings under Section804 and Section 805 of the Federal Fair Housing Act.</ITAG>The FDIC has no evidence that this has occurred.Typical of banker comments are the following:<ITAG tagnum="21">We believe that the proposed change recognizes the changing lendingsituation for home loans and, particularly, the increase in revolving linesof credit secured by the borrower's residence. To attempt to have consumersstate a single use of such lines of credit is not practical.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Furthermore, since these loans or lines of credit are generally limitedto a percentage of the owner's equity and are typically fully secured,unlawful discrimination would seem less likely.</ITAG>One trade association commented:<ITAG tagnum="21">Traditionally, home-equity loans have been marketed to consumers asa tool to improve their residences. With the increased growth in equityin homes throughout the country and as a result of new Federal income taxtreatment for interest deductions favoring home-equity loans, the frequencyand focus of such loans has been significantly altered. Now consumers aretapping the equity in their homes in order not only to provide for improvementsto their residences but also to assist in meeting other needs such as educationand debt consolidation. The marketplace has demonstrated that the Corporationis correct in indicating that ``home-equity loans are likely to becomepopular as substitutes for unsecured, open-end credit.''</ITAG>Another trade association offered the following:<ITAG tagnum="21">When the FDIC adopted Part 338's monitoring information requirementsin 1978, home equity credit lines were not prevalent as a lending vehicle.Since lenders often advertise these loans in print media and mail loanapplications upon request, both the relevancy and the accuracy of thismonitoring data have been questioned. With lenders taking fewer applicationsin person, the likelihood of certain types of discrimination is significantlyreduced. In addition, many lenders have complained that a substantial numberof customers either omit the monitoring section or complete it incorrectly.</ITAG>One banker wrote:<ITAG tagnum="21">The current wave of home equity secured lending, prompted by recenttax law changes, is more akin to traditional consumer lending than mortgagelending. Indeed, in most banks these new home equity products are managedfrom the consumer/installment loan department. Certainly these new loansare not the type of ``home loans'' contemplated by the drafters of theFair Housing Act, and it makes sense to exempt them from the data gatheringrequirements.</ITAG>The impact of home-equity loans on banks relative to Part 338 was expressedthusly by one banker:<ITAG tagnum="21">As lending is progressing to a more insecure climate, real estatewill be used to a greater and greater degree. To report every real estatesecured loan on fair housing would be to report 70% of a bank's currentday business when the purpose [of the regulation] is something quite different.</ITAG>The one creditor opposing the proposal responded that he had observed thatbanks, in general, avoid altogether or make ``low ball'' repair/rehabilitationtype loans available to borrowers in communities heavily populated by minorities.This creditor stated that the data requirements should continue in orderto keep pressure on banks to make such loans. As an enforcer of fair housingpractices by lenders, this has not been the observation of FDIC examiners.If this were the case, it would be a violation of fair lending laws andonce posed in the form of a complaint to the attention of the appropriatefinancial regulators, would receive requisite enforcement attention andresolution.Issue 3a: <T3>Bank Compliance Problems with the Monitoring Information Requirements:</T3>One trade association suggested the possible negative effects the existingdata requirement may have on home improvement lending as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">The problems state chartered non-member banks have had with complyingwith 12 CFR 338's information recording requirements are principally withopen end credit ``home equity'' loans. Applicants for this type of creditmay or may not have a specific use for draws when applying for a ``homeequity'' loan. Further, even if home improvement is the applicant's intentfor his or her first draw, it is doubtful the borrower knows what futuredraws will be used for.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As a result of this quandary, some creditors have required applicantsfor home equity loans to agree in their applications that the program willnot be used for home improvements. Thus, the regulation has effectivelylimited borrower's access to credit for home improvement loans.</ITAG>One banker responded that it is a very confusing matter when informationis required to be collected in one instant and is a violation to be collectedin another. Another agreed: ``It is often confusing to loan officers asto when they are supposed to collect this data and when they are not.''As one banker stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">Given the board scope of the `improvement, repair, or maintenance'category, and the recent upsurge in equity secured lending for a wide varietyof non-traditional purposes, bankers are many times unsure whether thedata should be gathered for a particular loan.</ITAG>Another banker stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">The current tax law has prompted our bank, as well as our competitors,to market home equity loans on a large scale * * *. At [the loan's] inception,the purpose may be unknown, or if known, future draws may be for otherpurposes.</ITAG>Another banker stated that to attempt to have consumers state a singleuse of such lines of credit is not practical. Possible confusion as tothe purpose along with the use to which the monitoring data will be putwas addressed by one trade association:<ITAG tagnum="21">Since lenders often advertise these loans in print media and mailloan applications upon request, both the relevancy and the accuracy ofthis monitoring data have been questioned. With lenders taking fewer applicationsin person, the likelihood of certain types of discrimination is significantlyreduced. In addition, many lenders have complained that a substantial numberof customers either omit the monitoring section or complete it incorrectly.</ITAG>With regard to home improvement loans, a trade association reported:<ITAG tagnum="21">One specific problem over the years concerns indirect home improvementloans or those loans which can be classified as credit sales. A large percentageof home improvement loans are generated by contractors or sellers of goodsand services for home improvement purposes. Those loans are, in the majorityof cases, consummated without the * * * bank's having an opportunity tointerview or observe the applicant to obtain the monitoring information.</ITAG>Some bankers acknowledged the changing lending situation for home loans,citing increased competition among lenders and the increasing sophisticationof both borrowers and lenders. One banker stated that because of the foregoing,all fair housing reporting requirements should have a sunset provisionbecause the need to produce loans, i.e., to maximize profits, far exceedsany desire to discriminate. The reference is to the increasingly competitivesecured credit lending market.Issue 3b: <T3>Compliance Burden in Time and Money:</T3>While one respondent (opposed) questioned the cost burden of the presentregulation, the great majority of lender and trade association respondents(47 of 70) cited the collection of the monitoring information as burdensome.Smaller banks indicated that the lifting of data-monitoring requirementswould be particularly beneficial. Bankers generally questioned the relevancy,validity and usefulness of the monitoring data. Some bankers estimatedthe actual costs of collecting the information (including training costs)by hours per day, per year, relative to staff salaries. Even modest costscame to be understood by some as more significant when annualized and especiallywhen combined with shrinking profit margins. Cost estimates varied. Onebanker stated: ``Since these loans [home-equity and home improvement] are,on average, less than one-third the size of the average residential mortgageat our bank, the incremental cost per loan of gathering and recording thisinformation is more than three times as great per loan.'' Costs were notthe only concern of bankers, however. One reported that eliminating home-equityand home improvement loans from the data requirements would reduce thepaperwork burden on the banking industry without having a negative impacton [compliance with] fair housing regulations. Another banker stated: ``Anysteps to reduce the paperwork burden on community banks without jeopardizingthe basic rights of the consumer would be appreciated.''Burdensomeness has a special meaning from the perspective of holding companies,as one respondent noted:<ITAG tagnum="21">The FDIC, having a different requirement than the Federal Reserveor the Comptroller of the Currency, has given us problems in the past.We have both non-member state banks, member state banks, and national banksin our bancorporation. We do much of our training for present and futurelenders on a combined basis. It is very hard to accomplish this trainingwhen we are dealing with two or three sets of rules. It is also quite commonfor us to transfer personnel from one bank to another. One problem thatexists is when an individual is lending at a national bank or member statebank and asks for monitoring information for a loan that is to be usedfor a home improvement, that individual would be breaking the law. However,if the person is working at a non-member state bank and fails to ask monitoringinformation on an application for a home improvement, he would be breakingthe law.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Related Issues Raised</ITAG>Cited also by one respondent were the commitments made by the FDIC in thesettlement agreement (which expired in 1983) arising out of the 1976 lawsuitbrought by major civil rights organizations. In that agreement, the FDICcommitted to establishing a data collection and analysis system to applyto written applications for home purchase loans. This system was to considerinclusion of applications for secured home improvement loans, dependingupon the ease with which such loans could be segregated from loans madefor purposes other than the repair or remodeling of residential propertyand whether sufficient added information relating to lending practicescould be obtained to justify the additional data collection costs. Experiencehas shown that it is very difficult to segregate loans for home improvement-typepurposes from all other home-equity loans and the costs to collect datafor home improvement-type loans relative to the benefits gained do notappear to be justified.Other suggestions raised by respondents concerned the desire to eliminaterefinancing from the definition of home loan in Part 338. This is not currentlyan option for consideration by the FDIC. While an enforcement agency mayrequire more comprehensive compliance than is specified in Regulation B,it is prohibited to require less (Section 202.13(d)). The information tobe requested in Regulation B andSection; 202.13(a) concerns application forcredit primarily for the purchase or refinancing of a dwelling. The sameargument pertains for respondents who suggested eliminating the collectionof certain data from all types of home loan applicants. Section 338.4 existsprimarily as a response to the requirements specified in ECOA's RegulationB.One respondent questioned the FDIC's continuing inclusion of constructionloans in the Part 338 definition of home loan. The FRB's Official StaffCommentary at andSection; 202.12(a)3 exempts temporary financing to constructa dwelling from andSection; 202.13 requirements. The FDIC believes that suchfinancing should be included in the scope of Part 338 data requirementssince creditor's decisions in this case can determine an applicant's accessto housing, a central concern in fair housing lending.One respondent suggested that while the FDIC is reviewing its fair lendingenforcement system, the use of testers to investigate possible fair lendingviolations be considered. At present, the FDIC does not employ testing.However, as has previously been publicly affirmed (see the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, October 1, 1985, Vol. 50, No. 190), the FDICwill consider testing if examiners strongly suspect that a bank is engagedin illegal prescreening and if the FDIC views testing as the only reliableway to detect that activity.One community advocate raised the point that the Paperwork Reduction Actwas not meant to interfere with the authority of any Federal agency toenforce civil rights laws. The FDIC stated in its proposed rule concerningthe amendment of Part 338, that the proposed changes could reduce the paperworkburden of the banking industry without impairing the enforcement of thefair housing lending laws. The purpose of the proposal was only indirectlyin response to the Paperwork Reduction Act. The primary concern here wasthe rapidly increasing volume of loans beginning to fall within the broadlydrafted scope of the andSection; 338.1(f) definition of ``home loan.'' TheFDIC did not foresee the advent of open-end, home-equity loans in 1978when the original definition was written and to include these types ofloans within the scope of Part 338 as has happened goes beyond the originalintent of the rule.The FDIC does not intend by this change to imply that less priority isaccorded matters concerning fair lending compliance. Efforts to streamlineprocedures are aimed at adhering to standards of effectiveness, efficiency,and uniformity. The FDIC has a strong continuing commitment to the enforcementof all fair lending laws, regulations and rules, and this change is notin contravention of that position.Based on full consideration of all of the points raised both in supportof, and in opposition to, the proposed amendment, the FDIC is amendingPart 338 to eliminate improvement, maintenance and repair loans from existing``home loan'' data-gathering requirements. Home-equity loans for thesepurposes would also be eliminated. Part 338 amendments require monitoringinformation to apply to loans the primary purpose of which is home purchase,construction and refinancing. The FDIC believes that this amendment willreduce the paperwork burden on the banking industry without impairing enforcementof fair housing lending laws.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects is 12 CFR Part 338</ITAG>Advertising, Banks, Banking, Civil rights, Credit, Fair housing, Mortgages,Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Signs and symbols.The Board of Directors of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation amendsPart 338 of Title 12 of the <T3>Code of Federal Regulations </T3>as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 338_FAIR HOUSING</ITAG>1.
