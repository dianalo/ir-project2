All obstacles can beovercome.'' But there are some things that even the seeminglyinvincible Trump, who plans to acquire Eastern Airlines' three-cityshuttle service, can't control.   The bitter, escalating labor dispute at Eastern, as well aspending litigation by Eastern unions against the shuttle sale, havethrown a monkey wrench into Trump's planned debut in the airlinebusiness.   The 2-year rivalry between Eastern and Pan Am Corp. in thelucrative Northeast shuttle business is expected to intensify whenthe flamboyant Trump completes his $365 million purchase of theEastern shuttle.   Despite the gathering storm clouds at Miami-based Eastern, Trumpand Eastern officials say they hope to close the deal sometime thismonth. And the heads of both shuttles say they're gearing up forfierce competition waged on the battleground of service.   The two hourly shuttle services, used mainly by businesstravelers, link New York with Boston and Washington. For bothEastern and Pan Am, they are profitable units in an otherwise bleakfinancial landscape.   But Trump's takeover has been complicated by the strife atEastern.   As a Friday strike deadline set by the airline's Machinists unionapproaches, hope is fading for a last-minute settlement of the16-month contract dispute. On Friday, the National Mediation Boardrecommended that President Bush declare a presidential emergency _ amove that would at least delay the walkout for 60 days.   Observers speculate that if there is a strike, employees of theTrump Shuttle _ all of whom are currently with Eastern _ could walkout in sympathy with their former peers after the close of theshuttle deal, planned for sometime in March.   Bruce Nobles, the president of the Trump Shuttle, said hiscompany has recognized the Eastern unions as valid bargainingrepresentatives for Trump Shuttle employees. Trump's team plans tonegotiate separate agreements with those employees sometime beforeor after the sale is completed, he said in an interview.   If there is a strike against Eastern, ``We don't know what theimpact on us would be,'' said Nobles, the former president of PanAm's rival shuttle.   The uncertainty created by Eastern's labor situation, along withunion litigation contesting the sale of the shuttle to Trump, couldeven force Eastern to sell the service to the developer at a lowerprice, one analyst suggests.   ``Eastern is so hungry for cash,'' said Farrell Kupersmith, afinancial consultant to the Air Line Pilots Association who worksfor Touche Ross andamp; Co. in Miami. He said that Frank Lorenzo, thechairman of Eastern's parent company, Texas Air Corp., needs cash``desperately'' and might knock $25 million to $50 million off lastOctober's agreed purchase price of $365 million.   But Nobles and some analysts dismiss that idea as mere conjecture.   Trump may bargain for labor peace by offering his shuttleemployees higher wages than what Lorenzo is willing to pay,suggested Kevin Murphy, an airline analyst for Morgan Stanley andamp; Co.   Murphy calls speculation, however, the notion that Trump is``backing away'' from the shuttle acquisition.   If and when Trump completes the deal, observers agree that theshuttle showdown between the real estate tycoon and Pan Am willhinge on service, not fares.   ``It will be a highly competitive environment between the two(shuttles),'' said Paul Karos, who follows the industry for FirstBoston Corp. ``It's going to be a service battle.''   Trump has said he plans to spend ``tremendous amounts of money''to upgrade the Eastern shuttle, whose fleet of aging,blue-and-silver Boeing 727s will be redecorated and emblazoned withred, black and gold stripes as well as Trump's name on their tails.   Harris Herman, chief operating officer of the Pan Am Shuttle,said his team will continue to add services geared toward thebusiness traveler that he concedes could be matched by Trump. Pan Amrecently launched an advertising blitz calling its shuttle ``TheCorporate Jet'' and emphasizing services such as inflight telephones.   The average shuttle passenger takes 10 round trips a year on theservice and earns $115,000 annually, according to Eastern. Theone-way weekday fare is $99.   ``The (shuttle) market basically is pretty price-insensitive,''Herman said.</TEXT></DOC>
