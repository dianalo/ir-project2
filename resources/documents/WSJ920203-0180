Consumers Union also named a former PaineWebber broker,Stanley Feminella, in the suit. It said the fees wereovercharged on its investment portfolio in a kickbackconspiracy involving David Granston, its chief financialofficer from 1983 until his dismissal last April. It said Mr.Feminella was employed by PaineWebber from September 1986 toSeptember 1988.</LP><TEXT>   The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in the SouthernDistrict, said PaineWebber imposed &quot;undisclosed grosslyexcessive markups, commissions and fees, which were in no wayreasonably related to the fair market prices of thesecurities purchased or sold.&quot; And, it alleged, the brokerpaid illegal bribes and kickbacks to Mr. Granston.   The bulk of the transactions involved the purchase andsale of government mortgage-backed securities. PaineWebbersaid the Consumers Union lawsuit against it is &quot;totallywithout merit.&quot; It said it will contest the allegations&quot;vigorously in court.&quot; It added that Consumers Union, whichcontacted the company last March, &quot;has not providedPaineWebber with any evidence that would support ConsumersUnion's claim that Mr. Granston obtained kickbacks from theformer PaineWebber employee during 1986 to 1988.&quot;   The securities firm said it has &quot;tried to resolve thismatter directly&quot; with Consumers Union and &quot;is obviouslydisappointed that Consumers Union is now seeking toadjudicate the issue in the court.&quot;   Neither Messrs. Granston nor Feminella could be reachedfor comment.   Consumers Union last June reached a settlement withShearson Lehman Brothers Inc., a unit of American ExpressCo., in which the brokerage firm -- which employed Mr.Feminella from September 1988 to March 1991 -- refundedcompensation, interest and expenses relating to othertransactions.   Consumers Union said the circumstances of the securitiestrades are currently under criminal investigation by the U.S.attorney's office in New York.</TEXT></DOC>
