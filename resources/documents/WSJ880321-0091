Hilder (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> FIN GOVMT </CO><IN> BNK TNM </IN><TEXT>   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, trying to stem an outflow of deposits from deeply troubled American Savings andamp; Loan Association, the nation's second-largest thrift, said it will protect all depositors and general creditors of the thrift.    The Bank Board's action Friday was timed to coincide with disclosures by American Savings' parent, Irvine, Calif.-based Financial Corp. of America, that the thrift unit's liabilities exceed its assets by $106 million as of year-end and that by mid-March the thrift had a net deposit outflow of $449 million, or 2.7% of deposits, since Jan. 1.    The Bank Board said it has never before issued a blanket guarantee to uninsured depositors and creditors of a thrift. However, its announcement echoed a similar guarantee made last week by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to depositors and creditors of banks owned by First RepublicBank Corp. of Dallas. As in the case of Continental Illinois Corp. in 1984, the guarantees last week indicate that federal regulators are likely to protect uninsured depositors at large banks and thrifts that become troubled, although they generally don't extend the same protection to uninsured depositors at small institutions.    Deposit insurance at banks and thrifts normally covers amounts up to $100,000 per depositor.    Only about $400 million of American Savings' deposits of $16.68 billion are uninsured, so the guarantee doesn't greatly increase the liabilities of the beleaguered Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. But it underscores Financial Corp.'s deteriorating condition and the psychological impact that regulators fear its collapse could have on the thrift industry. With $33.7 billion in assets, American Savings ranks second in size behind Home Savings of America, the main unit of Los Angeles-based H.F. Ahmanson andamp; Co.    &quot;It's the largest problem thrift we have,&quot; a Bank Board spokesman said. &quot;This is designed as a stabilizing measure, to keep things on an even keel.&quot;    However, William J. Popejoy, chairman of Financial Corp., in effect blamed the Bank Board for much of the recent deposit outflow. Mr. Popejoy said the outflows were primarily insured deposits and became &quot;most pronounced&quot; after the Bank Board confirmed newspaper reports that it was seeking to sell American Savings' 185 branches to other California thrifts. &quot;That's when we started to see the bread-and-butter deposits start to move,&quot; Mr. Popejoy said.    The Bank Board quickly abandoned its branch-sale effort, which Mr. Popejoy and outside experts had criticized as the most costly solution to Financial Corp.'s problems.    In its annual filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Financial Corp. disclosed that retail branch deposits decreased by $619 million during January and February, while institutional deposits, primarily in insured amounts, increased by $143 million. During the first 16 days of March, the company said, retail branch deposits decreased a further $50 million, while institutional deposits increased by $77 million.    Financial Corp. also disclosed that American Savings's net worth, or assets minus liabilities, turned negative for the first time based on generally accepted accounting principles. Because of a fourth-quarter loss of $224.6 million, Financial Corp.'s net worth already had become a negative $163.3 million as of Dec. 31. But when the loss was reported, Financial Corp. said that American Savings still had $20 million in net worth and $195 million in capital as figured under more liberal regulatory accounting principles.    But Financial Corp. disclosed in the SEC filing that because of the parent company's deteriorating financial condition, American Savings wrote off $126 million that was owed to it by Financial Corp. That write-off resulted in American Savings' negative net worth of $106 million. The thrift still has capital of $69 million but needs an additional $1.3 billion in capital to meet regulatory requirements. In the SEC filing, Financial Corp. also disclosed that its outside auditing firm, Peat Marwick Main andamp; Co., refrained from an opinion on the company's 1987 financial statements because of major uncertainties about pending shareholder litigation and about Financial Corp.'s ability to continue as a going concern.    In its letter, Peat Marwick noted that Financial Corp.'s ability to continue as a going concern depends primarily on support from the Bank Board and on the level of interest rates. Peat Marwick noted that a promise by the Bank Board not to take action against Financial Corp. on capital requirements expires March 31 and hasn't been renewed.    Financial Corp., in the SEC filing, made its most explicit warnings to date of the possible risks to its own shareholders. It said that if the Bank Board finds an acquirer for American Savings, the plan &quot;may not include any remuneration or contingent remuneration&quot; to Financial Corp. The company also said that if the FSLIC takes control of American Savings, it isn't required to notify Financial Corp. in advance, and that Financial Corp.'s ownership interest in the thrift likely would be wiped out.    Financial Corp. common shares closed Friday at $1.625, unchanged, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.    Financial Corp. also said it has sold $2.3 billion of mortgage-backed securities at the direction of the Bank Board, and may sell more if market conditions allow sales without incurring losses.    The company also said that four Wall Street firms threatened in February to refuse to renew short-term loans to American Savings because the Bank Board hadn't renewed its letter of support for the thrift. However, within a few days, the Bank Board reassured the Wall Street firms and the loans were renewed as they matured. </TEXT></DOC>
