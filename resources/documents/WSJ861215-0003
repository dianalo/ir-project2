This view emerges from interviews with economists and bankers amid widespread speculation that the economy will sag in the first few months of 1987. The Fed's policy-making arm, known as the Federal Open Market Committee, meets today and tomorrow to review its credit strategy.    Fed officials &quot;aren't likely to make any changes&quot; at this week's meeting, says Lyle E. Gramley, chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers Association of America and a former Fed governor. W. Lee Hoskins, senior vice president and chief economist at PNC Financial Corp. in Pittsburgh, agrees. &quot;There are no clear signals that the economy is either faltering or booming,&quot; he says.    The economy will slow next year partly because of the new tax law, many analysts say. They contend that the tax changes are bolstering business activity this quarter at the expense of next year's first quarter. Most forecasters estimate the economy this quarter is expanding at an annual rate of around 2 1/2% to 3 1/2%. That would compare with a 2.9% clip in the third quarter, after adjusting for inflation.    Business activity this quarter has been helped as corporations rush to complete projects before tougher new tax rules go into effect Jan. 1. In addition, many consumers have been buying big-ticket items while they can still deduct sales taxes on their federal income tax returns.    Fed officials will wait to see the effect of the tax package on the economy early next year before changing credit policy, says Samuel Kahan, chief financial economist at Kleinwort Benson Government Securities Inc. He contends the Fed would like to see the economy grow at close to a 3% pace. But he predicts business activity will expand at only a 1 1/2% to 2% rate in 1987's first quarter, prompting the Fed to drive interest rates lower.    The Fed's 12-member policy group won't make any changes in strategy at this week's meeting, agrees Philip Braverman, chief economist at Irving Securities Inc. But he contends the Fed will have to ease credit conditions aggressively in coming months to keep the economy from sinking into a recession.    The economy is &quot;quite sluggish and vulnerable to recession,&quot; Mr. Braverman warns. He predicts business activity will expand at only about a 1% annual rate in next year's first half. He expects the Fed to cut its discount rate to 5% from 5 1/2% in February or March and then follow up with another reduction to 4 1/2% within two months of the first move. The discount rate, which already has been cut by two percentage points this year, is the fee the Fed charges on loans to banks and savings institutions.    Mr. Braverman predicts that the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds, now about 7 3/8%, will fall to about 6 1/2% to 6 3/4% by mid-1987. He also predicts that banks will lower their prime, or base, rate on corporate loans to 6 1/2% by mid-1987. The prime rate has stood at 7 1/2% since late August.    Until a few weeks ago, many analysts thought the Fed might lower its discount rate this month. But those hopes faded after some recent government reports indicated unexpected strength in the economy. For example, the Labor Department on Dec. 5 said the number of workers on nonfarm payrolls increased a strong 249,000 in November after rising 260,000 in October.    Federal Reserve figures to be released today are likely to show a healthy 0.5% increase in industrial production in November, many economists predict. Production was unchanged in October and was up a scant 0.1% in September.    Fed officials &quot;have to ask themselves if the long-awaited improvement&quot; in the economy finally is here, says Mr. Gramley of the Mortgage Bankers Association. &quot;My guess is they will conclude it probably isn't. But they will want to wait to be sure&quot; before making any policy changes, he adds.    Some forecasters say the Fed won't move unless West Germany and Japan take similar action. They argue that the odds of another round of coordinated interest-rate reductions have greatly increased because of weak economic growth during the third quarter in both West Germany and Japan.    Nevertheless, recent increases in oil prices have sent jitters through the credit markets. Some investment managers worry that continued rises in oil prices could be a harbinger of renewed inflationary pressures.    Higher oil prices helped depress bond prices last Thursday and Friday. Some actively traded U.S. Treasury issues slumped about a point, or around $10 for each $1,000 face amount, on those two days.    The Treasury's 7 1/2% bonds due 2016 fell on Friday to 101 10/32 from 101 22/32 on Thursday. The yield rose to 7.39% from 7.36%. The government's 7 1/4% notes due 1996 fell to 100 29/32 from 101 5/32, increasing the yield to 7.12% from 7.08%.    The rate on the latest 13-week Treasury bills fell to 5.47% bid Friday from 5.48% Thursday. The bid on the latest 26-week bills rose to 5.5% from 5.48%. </TEXT></DOC>
