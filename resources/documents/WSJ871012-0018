The much larger Merc launched a competing gold futures contract in June, following clearing problems at the Comex.    At first, the Merc's contract shone, averaging volume of nearly 8,000 contracts a day the first month. But by September, trading turnover plunged to about 400 contracts, or less than 2% of Comex's. And this month volume has shrunk even more. Open interest, or contracts outstanding, also has fallen from early levels.    &quot;Comex did everything in its power to give the gold market away,&quot; said Thomas Russo, a commodity and securities lawyer for Cadwalader, Wickersham andamp; Taft in New York. &quot;If there was ever an opportunity for the Merc to take it, it would have been this summer.&quot; In May, surging precious metals volume triggered a huge backlog of unresolved trades, forcing the Comex to halt trading early on three consecutive days.    The Chicago exchange's problems illustrate the difficulty for a secondary marketplace -- even one as large and successful as the Merc-to wrest significant trading share from an established liquid contract, commodity executives say.    But there are other factors dogging the Merc's effort. Until early last month, the contract's delivery point of London differed from Comex's established New York delivery location, deterring some dealers accustomed to the Comex contract. No sooner had some grown used to London than the Merc switched to New York and Wilmington, Del., delivery, causing more confusion for traders and dealers, exchange officials say.    &quot;We've been in a suffering period since the switch began,&quot; says Leo Melamed, Merc executive committee chairman.    A dull gold market has added to the contract's woes. Some Merc officials and traders contend that activity will pick up only when gold prices break out of their current tight range. &quot;It's impossible -- no matter who you are -- to get a new contract active when the market is dead,&quot; says Ross Rowland, who sold his Comex seat in the spring after 26 years to trade in Chicago.    With a quiet gold market, moreover, there is little strain on the trade-matching system that led to Comex's initial problems, traders note, giving some participants little reason to switch to Chicago.    But some futures industry officials insist that it is only in slow markets with small price movements that traders will be tempted to test the waters of a secondary contract. &quot;Nobody is going to switch business in a fast market,&quot; one industry executive says.    In any case, some traders note, the Comex soundly beat the Merc after both exchanges began trading gold more than a dozen years ago; the Merc dropped its original contract in July 1985. And industry officials contend that gold is a New York-centered market because most large dealers and banks are located here.    What's more, the Chicago Board of Trade introduced a new gold contract last month, siphoning some volume from the Merc even though volume there also is low. &quot;One market will always prevail, and if two exchanges are trying to steal it, it makes it that much more difficult,&quot; says Kenneth Raisler, former general counsel of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and currently a partner with Rogers andamp; Wells in New York.    The Comex, meanwhile, has taken steps to improve its trade-matching system to prevent a recurrence of this spring's problems.    Even a $1 million incentive program that pays traders to participate in the Chicago contract hasn't sparked much enthusiasm. Starting about a month ago, the Merc has offered traders $1 for each trade they make, though volume has continued to dwindle.    Still, the Merc is far from throwing in the towel. Exchange officials contend that sufficient time hasn't passed to adequately judge the new contract's merits. &quot;This is a long-term effort and you can't make a judgment in four months,&quot; the Merc's Mr. Melamed says. &quot;There's no way we're going to go away.&quot;    The exchange, in fact, recently redoubled efforts to rejuvenate the contract. Last week, Mr. Melamed urged the Merc's board of governors to push more members to trade in the gold pit. Merc officials also traveled in recent days to speak with about a dozen representatives of New York's gold-dealing community, and were encouraged to continue the contract. And the exchange will soon beef up its gold-marketing and research efforts, officials say.    Some traders, for their part, seem to be staying put. &quot;I can't say that I'll stay here for 12 years, but I'll give it every chance to succeed,&quot; says Mr. Rowland, the former Comex trader.    For the next year, the Merc hopes to keep its contract afloat until it can be offered through a proposed electronic trading system. The recently announced transaction system, called Post (Pre) Market Trade, will effectively allow the gold contract to be traded world-wide around the clock. &quot;Once it's internationally listed, we think we're going to get a real injection of interest from all over the world,&quot; says Mr. Melamed.    At the same time, of course, any crimps in Comex clearing could add to Chicago gold's allure. But Comex officials, for the moment at least, don't appear overly concerned.    Says one Comex executive: &quot;The numbers tell the story.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
