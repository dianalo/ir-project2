Lloyd,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Executive Secretary, Defense Acquisition Regulatory Council.</ITAG>Accordingly, the Department is correcting 48 CFR Parts 227 and 252 as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 227_PATENTS, DATA, AND COPYRIGHTS</ITAG>1. Subpart 227.4, consisting of sections 227.481 through 227.481-2, iscorrectly revised to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="80">227.481 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Acquisition of rights in computer software.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">227.481-1 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Policy.</ITAG>(a) The Government shall have unlimited rights in:(1) Computer software resulting directly from or generated as part of theperformance of experimental, developmental, or research work specifiedas an element of performance in a Government contract or subcontract;(2) Computer software required to be originated or developed under a Governmentcontract, or generated as a necessary part of performing a contract;(3) Computer data bases, prepared under a Government contract, consistingof (i) information supplied by the Government; (ii) information in whichthe Government has unlimited rights; or (iii) information which is in thepublic domain;(4) Computer software prepared or required to be delivered under this orany other Government contract or subcontract and constituting correctionsor changes to Government-furnished software; or(5) Computer software which is in the public domain or has been or is normallyfurnished by the contractor or subcontractor without restriction.(b) When the Government has unlimited rights in computer software in thepossession of a contractor, no payment will be made for rights of use ofsuch software in performance of Government contracts or for the later deliveryto the Government of such computer software: <T3>Provided, however, </T3>That the contractor shall be entitled to compensationfor converting the software into the prescribed form for reproduction anddelivery to the Government.(c) It is Department of Defense policy to acquire only such rights to use,duplicate, and disclose computer software developed at private expenseas are necessary to meet Government needs. Such rights should be designedto allow the Government flexibility while, at the same time, adequatelypreserving the rights of the contractor. Computer software developed atprivate expense may be purchased or leased. Restrictions may be negotiatedwith respect to the right of the Government to use, duplicate, or disclosecomputer programs or computer data bases developed at private expense.As a minimum, however, the Government shall have the rights provided inthe definition of restricted rights in section 227.471.(d) Patented or copyrighted computer software will not be subject to anyagreement prohibiting the Government from infringing a patent or copyright.Title 28, United States Code, Section 1498 provides that the Governmentis liable only for reasonable compensation for use of a patented inventionor for infringement of copyright. However, see section 227.7011.(e) When computer software is developed at private expense and acquiredwith restricted rights, the associated computer software documentationwill be acquired with limited rights to the extent provided in the definitionof limited rights in section 227.471, and will not be used for preparingthe same or similar computer software.(f) Commercial computer software and related documentation developed atprivate expense may be leased, or a license to use may be purchased, bythe Government subject to the restrictions in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of theclause at 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data and Computer Software.<ITAG tagnum="80">227.481-2</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Procedures.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Deviations. </T3>All requests for deviations from this section 227.481shall be submitted to the DAR Council in accordance with the proceduresin FAR Section 1.404.(b) <T3>General. </T3>(1) Except as provided at 252.227-7031, Data Requirements,any computer program or computer data base to be acquired under a contractshall be listed on the Contract Data Requirements List (DD Form 1423).Also, if a contract requires the conversion of data to machine-readableform, the editing or revision of existing programs, or the preparationof computer software documentation, the products of this work, if requiredto be delivered, shall be included on the DD Form 1423.(2) The clause at 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data and Computer Software,shall be included in every contract under which computer software may beoriginated, developed, or delivered. That clause establishes the circumstancesunder which the Government secures unlimited rights in both technical dataand computer software, limited rights in technical data, and restrictedrights in computer software. In negotiated contracts where the clause at252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data and Computer Software, is required,the provision at 252.227-7019, Identification of Restricted Rights ComputerSoftware, shall be included in the solicitation.(3) Contracts under which computer software developed at private expenseis acquired or leased shall explicitly set forth the rights necessary tomeet Government needs and restrictions applicable to the Government asto use, duplication and disclosure of the software. Thus, for example,such software may be needed, or the owner of such software will only sellor lease it, for specific or limited purposes such as for internal agencyuse, or for use in a specific activity, installation or service location.In any event, the contract must clearly define any restrictions on theright of the Government to use such computer software, but such restrictionswill be acceptable only if they will permit the Government to fulfill theneed for which such software is being acquired. The recital of restrictionsmay be complete within itself or it may reference the contractor's licenseor other agreement setting forth restrictions. If referencing is employed,a copy of the license or agreement must be attached to the contract. Theminimun rights are provided in the Rights in Technical Data and ComputerSoftware clause at 252.227-7013, and need not be included in the recital.(4) When computer software developed at private expense is modified orenhanced as a necessary part of performing a contract, only that portionof the resulting product in which the original product is recognizablewill be deemed to be computer software developed at private expense towhich restricted rights may attach.(5) The scope of the restriction on or, conversely, the scope of the usewhich the Government is permitted to make of such software shall be takeninto account when determining the reasonableness of the contract pricefor the computer software.(c) <T3>Computer software subject to restricted rights. </T3>(1) Because ofthe widely-varying restrictions which are likely to be encountered in thepurchase or lease of computer software developed at private expense, astandard recital setting forth specific restrictions and rights suitablefor all cases is not feasible. If the standard set of restrictions andrights set forth in paragraph 227.481-1(f) for commercial computer softwareis not appropriate, personnel are urged to consult counsel in any casein which the proposed contractor requests the Government to accept otherrestrictions on the use of such software.(2) To apprise user personnel of the restrictions on use, duplication ordisclosure agreed to by the Government with respect to such software soldor leased to the Government, the contractor is required to place the followinglegend on such software:<ITAG tagnum="74">Restricted Rights Legend</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Use, duplication or disclosure is subject to restrictions stated inContract No. <T2>XXXX</T2> with <T2>XXXX</T2> (Name of Contractor).</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">For commercial computer software and documentation, the contract numbermay be omitted and replaced by ``paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of the Rights inTechnical Data and Computer Software clause at 252.227-7013'', and thecontractor's address added. The Government shall include the same restrictivemarkings on all its reproductions of the computer software unless the Governmentcancels such markings pursuant to the procedures in 227.473-4(c).(3) A statement setting forth the restrictions imposed on the Governmentto use, duplicate, and disclose computer software subject to restrictedrights is required to be prominently displayed in human-readable form inthe computer software documentation. The reference to the Rights in TechnicalData and Computer Software clause in the Restricted Rights Legend on commercialcomputer software and documentation satisfies this requirement.(4) Except as provided in paragraph (b) above, computer programs, computerdata bases, and computer software documentation delivered to the Governmentpursuant to a contract requirement must be identified with the number ofthe prime contract and the name of the contractor.(5) All markings (notice, legends, identifications, etc.), concerning restrictionson the use, duplication, or disclosure of computer software required orauthorized by the terms of the contract under which delivery is made arerequired to be in human-readable form that can be readily and visuallyperceived and, in addition may be in machine-readable form as appropriateand feasible under the circumstances. Such markings shall be affixed bythe contractor to the computer software prior to delivery of the softwareto the Government.(6) The human-readable markings may be applied to card decks, magnetictape reels, or disc packs. This may be, in the case of a card deck, ona notice card even though the cards of the deck do not contain printedmaterial; in the case of a card deck packaged in a container intended asa permanent receptacle for the cards, on the container; in the case ofa tape, on the tape reel or on the surface of the leader and trailer ofthe tape; and in the case of a disc pack, on the hub of the disc.(d) <T3>Unmarked or Improperly Marked Computer Software. </T3>(1) No restrictivemarkings shall be placed upon computer software unless restrictions areset forth in the contract prior to delivery of the software. Copyrightnotices as specified in Title 17, United States Code, Sections 401 and402 are not considered ``restrictive markings''. The Government may requirethe contractor to identify the contractual provision setting forth suchrestrictions before accepting computer software with restrictive markings.If computer software is received with restrictive markings, and there isa question whether it is authorized by the contract to be furnished withrestricted rights, it shall be used subject to the asserted restrictionspending written inquiry to the contractor. If no response to an inquiryhas been received within 60 days, or if the response fails to identifythe restrictions set forth in the contract, the cognizant Government personnelshall cancel or ignore the markings, notify the contractor accordinglyin writing, and thereafter use the software with unlimited rights.(2) Computer software received without a restrictive legend shall be deemedto have been furnished with unlimited rights. However, the contractor mayrequest permission to place restrictive markings on such software at itsown expense, and the Government may so permit, if the contractor establishesthat the markings are authorized by the contract and demonstrates the theomission was inadvertent. Failure of the contractor to mark such computersoftware prior to delivery to the Government shall relieve the Governmentof liability for any use, duplication or disclosure of such computer software.(3) If computer software authorized by the contract to be furnished withrestrictions is received with restrictive markings not in the form prescribedby the contract, the software should be used in accordance with the restrictionsprovided for in the contract and the contractor shall be required by writtennotice to correct the markings to conform with those specified in the contract.If the contractor fails to correct the markings within 60 days after notice,Government personnel may correct the markings, and so notify the contractor.<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 252_SOLICITATION PROVISIONS AND CONTRACT CLAUSES</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">252.227-7013</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">[Corrected]</ITAG>2.
