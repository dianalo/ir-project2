The possibility of a strike on the Moscow-Leningrad line wasraised Sunday by the Communist Party daily newspaper Pravda, whichcited worker discontent over wages and work conditions.   Trade union chief Stepan Shalayev, interviewed at today sessionof the Supreme Soviet legislature, said, ``there were demands,threats by some work collectives, but the Railway Ministry andunion took measures to review the demands in time and tookdecisions to prevent strikes.''   He said there were no rail workers on strike and ``today, thesituation is not threatening any stoppage of the railroad.''   Railway Minister Nikolai S. Konarev was shown on the nationaltelevision news program Vremya Monday night talking by intercomfrom his Moscow office to leaders of railway services of the SovietUnion's 32 railroads.   He was shown admonishing the 15,830 managers for failing toadequately take care of workers and their families.   ``Violations of the normal regime has almost become the rule,''he said. ``You aren't allowed to do that, but you do it. Left andright you give orders which in the end lead to dissatisfaction oflocomotive brigades and their families,'' he said.   The news commentator said Konarev spoke with workers'representatives nationwide on Friday to hear their demands. Pravdasaid complaints included not being given adequate time to eat andwage discrepencies among workers.   ``The ministry agreed to improve the living conditions of therailway men and the tension was removed to some extent,'' thecommentator said.   Konarev, whose nomination to retain the post of Railway Ministerwas rejected by the Supreme Soviet July 5, said on Vremya, ``thecountry lives, works and is fed from wheels. This I say with justone meaning, you must be respectful of trains.''   Konarev will keep his job until a new candidate is nominated byPremier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov.   Although President Mikhail S. Gorbachev sided with coal minerswho went on a 10-day strike two weeks ago, he warned against astrike by rail workers.   In a speech July 19, Gorbachev noted there had been calls for arail strike Aug. 1 and said such a strike would damage efforts toreform the Soviet economy and improve conditions for everyone.   There are 31 official trade unions in the Soviet Unionrepresenting 138.9 million workers, according to officialstatistics. The unions long have done little but follow officialpolicy, and workers have begun voicing their demands outside theofficial union structure.</TEXT></DOC>
