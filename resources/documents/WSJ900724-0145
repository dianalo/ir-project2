The climate satellite proposal, which has circulated amongscientists, already has provoked considerable controversy. Itcalls into question the necessity and timing of a gargantuanNational Aeronautics and Space Administration satelliteprogram, called the Earth Observing System, or EOS, whichcould cost as much as $50 billion over 25 years.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Hansen's proposal comes out of a series of privatemeetings that Sen. Albert Gore (D., Tenn.), chairman of thespace and science subcommittee, has held with about 20environmental scientists. Sen. Gore says he plans to releasea number of proposals in October to accelerate climateresearch. &quot;Something like what (Mr. Hansen) is proposing doesmake sense,&quot; the senator said.   Essentially, Mr. Hansen suggests taking three instrumentsoff EOS and NASA's proposed space station and putting them ona relatively small satellite, which would study clouds, watervapor and particles suspended in the atmosphere. If NASAlaunches two climate satellites, for about $200 million,starting in 1995, Mr. Hansen predicts, the satellites wouldyield enough information to settle the central debate overglobal warming by the end of the decade.   &quot;It would answer the questions of whether the Earth iswarming and whether humans are the cause of that,&quot; Mr. Hansensaid. An article giving details of his proposal is scheduledto be published in the fall issue of Issues in Science andTechnology, a publication of the National Academy ofSciences.   The climate satellites would focus on the role of clouds,Mr. Hansen said. Generally, clouds cool the Earth byreflecting sunlight back into space -- something akin to agiant window blind. But scientists don't know whether cloudcoverage is increasing or what kinds of clouds predominate,leading to big differences in the severity of global changepredicted by different computer models. &quot;Climate satellitesare a must,&quot; said Veerabhadran Ramanathan, a University ofChicago climate specialist.   Mr. Hansen's proposal puts him in the spotlight for thethird year in a row. In 1988, he set off alarms about globalchange by testifying in Congress, during a blistering heatwave, that he was &quot;99%&quot; certain that a global warming trendhad begun. Last year, he became a cause celebre when theWhite House Office of Management and Budget tried to censorhis testimony. This year, the quiet, determined director ofNASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York istaking on NASA's vast EOS project.   NASA envisions launching a half-dozen $3 billionsatellites, which would carry as many as 16 differentinstruments to study the Earth, including some as big ascars. The first satellite, EOS-A, is scheduled for launch in1998 and five others will follow over 15 years. The NationalSpace Council, led by Vice President Dan Quayle, is concernedabout the cost and risk of the project and is consideringwhether to restructure it.   Mr. Hansen says the EOS satellites, already three yearsbehind schedule, are bound to fall further behind -- leavingclimate scientists with big gaps in needed data. He says NASAcould fund the climate satellites out of a portion of the EOSproject devoted to smaller satellites.   But EOS officials think that Mr. Hansen is underestimatingthe cost of his climate satellites and that his project wouldsiphon funds from EOS, undercutting support for the program.&quot;The dumbest thing to do is to say maybe EOS ought to slip ayear to solve Jim Hansen's problems,&quot; said Gerald Soffen,EOS's project scientist.   Two NASA scientists at the agency's Langley ResearchCenter sent Mr. Hansen a six-page letter criticizing hisproposal as too limited because it fails to consider otherenvironmental problems EOS will address, such as ozonedepletion, acid rain and deforestation. Berrien Moore, aUniversity of New Hampshire scientist involved with EOS, saidhe doubts that the climate satellites will settle theglobal-warming issue. &quot;I don't think you'll get a smokinggun,&quot; he said.   For his part, Mr. Hansen says he doesn't want to kill EOS,which will provide data needed to make better predictions ofhow the climate will change in different places on Earth. Buthe is willing to forgo EOS data for a time to answer what heconsiders a more pressing question sooner.   The criticism of Mr. Hansen's proposal is overlaid with asense of consternation about Mr. Hansen's ability to dominatethe global-warming debate and fear of his popularity inCongress. If the climate satellite approach proves popular,Mr. Moore said, &quot;There's a high probability that Congresswill say we'll throw up a $200 million satellite and buy outof the (EOS) project.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
