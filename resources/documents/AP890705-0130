Hastings of Miami next Monday.   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell ruled that he had nojurisdiction to rule on Hastings' claims that the Senate procedurefor hearing the impeachment evidence violated due process.   Hastings faces Senate trial on 17 articles of impeachment,including allegations that he lied during his 1983 bribery trial,which ended in his acquittal, and that he obstructed a corruptioninvestigation by disclosing wiretap information.   The Miami jurist had sought an injunction to bar the proceedingon the ground that appointment of a 12-member special impeachmentcommittee by the Senate violated his constitutional right to a trialof the evidence by the full Senate.   But Gesell said the Constitution gives the Senate the power todevise the procedures for conducting impeachment trials.   ``The Constitution simply does not specify in detail what isrequired for the trial before the Senate,'' the judge said. ``Absentevidence that the Senate is violating the Constitution, the courtshould stay its hand.''   He noted that the same committee procedure, with somemodificatins, was used in 1986 during the impeachment trial offormer U.S. District Judge Harry Claiborne of Nevada.   Several senators voted against Claiborne's impeachment, sayingthey objected to the committee procedure.   But Gesell said that issue was for the Senate, not the courts, todebate.   ``It is not this court's function to tinker with the Senate'sprocedures or to anticipate problems that could arise,'' Gesellwrote. ``The procedures adopted do not by their terms violate anyconstitutional rights or offend fundamental notions of justice.''   Gesell also rejected Hastings' claims that he is a victim ofdouble jeopardy because the Senate is considering many of the samecharges for which he was acquitted during the criminal trial.   But Gesell said Hastings' argument is based on a ``fundamentalmisapprehension'' because ``impeachment is not a criminalproceeding.''   ``Impeachment proceedings are not restricted by principles ofdouble jeopardy any more than conviction always necessitatesimpeachment,'' Gesell said.</TEXT></DOC>
