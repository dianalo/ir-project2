Igor M. Klyamkin's article in February's editions of Novy Mirmagazine comes as the Soviets prepare for next month's nationalelections _ the first in which voters will have more than onecandidate to choose from.   In an obvious reference to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's pushfor ``democratization'' as part of his reform campaign, the authorasserts that genuine democracy will not be possible unless the 20million-member party permits open dissent in its ranks.   Klyamkin hints at the central paradox of Gorbachev's``democratization'' push _ that it is occurring under the aegis of aparty that has declared itself society's sole legitimate ruler.   The author does not openly call for the creation of a multipartysystem, but that seems the inescapable conclusion many will drawfrom his criticism of anti-democratic practices he says theCommunist Party has engaged in starting from the days of Sovietfounder Vladimir I. Lenin.   ``The major reason for lies starting to dominate society was thatthe majority, whatever it was composed of, was fated to limitinterparty democracy and violate the rights of the minority. Thiswas discovered even when Lenin was still alive,'' Klyamkin wrote.   ``The political lie,'' he said, ``leads to catastrophe when someorganization or group of people has a full monopoly on power andinformation, where nobody can catch them deceiving others, or to putit more simply _ when there is no democracy.''   The article seems certain to fuel debate about the party's rolein political institutions being created this year as part ofGorbachev's plan to define more clearly the responsibilities ofparty and government.   Later this month, Soviet voters are to elect a new 2,550-seatCouncil of People's Deputies that will choose a more active SupremeSoviet parliament and the country's president, the governmentposition held by Gorbachev, who also is party general secretary.   Klyamkin said the political reforms are flawed by measures``which even the most vivid imagination cannot call democratic.''   The political changes give the party and other officiallyrecognized organizations the right to directly fill one third of theseats in the new assembly and, unlike current practice, impose atwo-step system for the election of Supreme Soviet deputies, whosince 1937 have been directly chosen by voters but who will now beelected by the Council of People's Deputies.   ``There are no free elections yet, and I'm not sure that therewill be any soon,'' wrote Klyamkin, who works at the Institute ofEconomics of the World Socialist System, a Kremlin think tank.   He also said anti-democratic traditions in the party had notpalpably changed in the nearly four years that Gorbachev has been atthe helm and that open debate on major issues is still muzzled bythe quest for ``monolithic unity.''   The article was the latest published by official mediacriticizing the role of the party in society.   In January, the Leningrad-based magazine Neva said Gorbachev'scampaign for economic and social change was being sabotaged by a``new class'' of party and government bureaucrats, and that theleadership was powerless to stop it.   Despite the party's claim that it serves the people and is the``vanguard of society,'' the average Soviet ``practically never hadaccess to the real levers of power and doesn't have it now either,''biologist and plant director Sergei Y. Andreyev wrote in Neva.   In a speech Friday in the Ukrainian capital of Kiev, Gorbachevused traditional formulas in describing the party he leads as the``vanguard social force,'' but said it should be society's guide,and not its commanding officer.</TEXT></DOC>
