Normal operationsand maintenance is defined as the average per acre cost of all activitiesinvolved in delivering irrigation water including pumped water and maintainingthe facilities. Due to the delivery of irrigation water from several sources(normal flow water, spill water, storage water and pumped water), it isnecessary to structure the assessment rates to reflect cost of water delivered.The assessment rates for the Salt River Indian Irrigation Project consistof a per acre rate for delivery of the first two (2) acre feet of water,a rate for delivery of the third (3rd) acre foot, delivery rate for additionalwater above 3 acre feet and a spill water rate. The per acre rate willprovide funds to cover a portion of the personnel and maintenance costswhile the per acre-foot delivery rate will provide funds to cover remainingcosts.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>This public notice will become effective upondate of publication and to remain in effect until changed by further notice.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Ray Albert, Acting Superintendent,Salt River Agency, Route 1, Box 117, Scottsdale, Arizona 85256, telephoneFTS 261-2842, COM (602) 241-2842.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>The authority to issue this document is vested in theSecretary of the Interior by 5 U.S.C. 301 and the Act of August 14, 1914(38 Stat. 583, 25 U.S.C. 385).</ITAG>This general notice is issued by authority delegated to the Assisatnt Secretaryfor Indian Affairs by the Secretary of the Interior in 209 DM 8 and redelegatedby the Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs to the Area Director in 10BIAM 3 and pursuant to andSection; 171.1 (e) of Part 171, Subchapter H, Chapter1, Title 25 of the Code of Federal Regulations. <ITAG tagnum="84">Determination Under E.O. 12291</ITAG>Pursuant to E.O. 12291 of February 17, 1981 (46 FR 13193, February 19,1981), each agency is to determine whether a rule it intends to issue isa major rule.

In 1983 the excess water (pumped water) rate was setat $29.08 per acre-feet and has increased to $30.53 per acre foot. Spillwater rate was established in 1983 as $6.75 per acre foot. The costs oflabor, materials, equipment, power and energy have continued to increaseeach year until costs now exceed revenue.The Agency staff and the Phoenix Area Office met with the waterusers andthe Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community on November 16, 1987, November25, 1987 and January 6, 1988, respectively, and through several additionalanalysis of available surface water the assessment rates were finalized.Comments were received by the Bureau from various lease holders and waterusers of the Reservation including the Indian Community. Concerns wereexpressed with the proposed assessment increases for the 1988 irrigationseason. The Community further urged that the Bureau take a hard look atthe productivity of the project and requested if the cost of providingOandamp;M services could be performed at mimimum cost in order to keep therate increases to a mimimum. Comments received at these public meetingswere carefully considered in arriving at the proposed rates. To avoid adversefinancial hardships for the irrigation project in the 1988 irrigation seasonthe proposed rates must be implemented without delay.
