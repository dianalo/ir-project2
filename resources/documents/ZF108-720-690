 But not enough of themhave.andM;According to recent quarterly reports from the Software PublishersAssociation, Macintosh software accounts for about 15 percent of all personalcomputer business-software sales but only about 8 percent of the databasecategory.andM;Even among the biggest Macintosh sites surveyed by MacWEEK for this report,IBM PCs and compatibles outnumber Macintoshes for use in databaseapplications by a wide margin.andM;What's the explanation for the database gap?andM;In years past, there may have been good reasons that Macs were not seriouslyconsidered for robust, mission-critical database applications.andP;  Early68000-based Macs and even the first Mac II models were underpowered for theserious data crunching called for by large-scale corporate databases.andP;  Norwere powerful relational-database software packages available for buildingcomplex applications.andM;Today, neither of these objections remains valid.andP;  High-end versions of theMac II series provide power comparable to that offered by the fastest PCsavailable in the Intel-based world.andP;  On the software side, there is now achoice of mature, full-featured database programs that are as good or betterthan anything offered for PCs.andM;Barriers to entry.andP;  Still, the database gap persists.andP;  Interviews withcorporate computer managers revealed at least eight reasons -- some based onfaulty perceptions, some on real deficiencies -- that Macs remain underusedfor database work.andM;andgt;Inertia.andP;  The installed base of DOS machines and DOS database applicationscreates a barrier to Macs.andP;  Investments in time, effort and money to developdatabases on one platform are not abandoned without good cause.andP;  There aremany DOS-based workhorse applications out there that may be ugly to a Macenthusiast but they do the job and will not go away until someone can provethat rewriting the application on another platform is cost-effective andbeneficial.andM;andgt;Maturity of software.andP;  The first PC databases were developed in the early1980s and have therefore had a longer time to mature and expand incapability.andP;  Search and sort algorithms have been refined.andP;  Development toolshave become sophisticated and flexible.andP;  Industry standards have emerged.andP;  Bycontrast, powerful relational databases became available on the Macintoshonly recently.andM;andgt;Cost of hardware.andP;  For users and developers not convinced of the advantagesof a graphical interface, the higher cost of a Macintosh compared with anequivalent PC clone is difficult to justify.andP;  Since multi-user databasesystems involve multiple computers, the Mac's price premium is even more of apenalty in database applications than in stand-alone productivityapplica-tions such as spreadsheets or word processing programs.andM;andgt;Performance.andP;  Despite the improvement in the basic speed of Mac hardware,Mac databases still may suffer slow overall performance.andP;  Databaseperformance is dependent on many variables, such as the file server,processor and I/O speed; network protocols and topology; and the quality ofthe application code.andP;  Some pieces of the Macintosh database puzzle -- suchas the initial release of ACIUS Inc.'s 4th Dimension and the throughput ofthe Mac's built-in networking architecture, LocalTalk -- are notablysluggish.andM;andgt;Client/server technology.andP;  A major advantage of choosing the PC as adatabase platform is the wider availability of client/server technology.andO;Products such as Oracle, SQL Server and VIA are now available forclient/server applications on PCs, while none supports the Macintosh asanything but a front end.andP;  When widely implemented, Apple Data AccessLanguage (DAL) will permit Macintosh applications to query databases residingon host computers and central servers.andP;  But DAL is unproven, and the factremains that there are more options available for PCs than for Macintoshes.andM;andgt;Psychology.andP;  DOS database developers tend to value high performance and lowcost over ease of use.andP;  There are some who believe there is a certainmachismo in writing database code, and some of them may even consider ease ofuse to be a disad-vantage.andP;  With character-based systems, usually less timeis spent refining the user interface, since functions such as buttons,windows and dialog boxes are not present.andP;  This can drastically decreasedevelopment time.andM;andgt;Development environment.andP;  Related to the maturity of database software isthe availability of sophisticated development tools.andP;  PC database developersenjoy a wide range of available tools such as compilers, run-time generatorsand procedural languages.andP;  These tools are much more limited on the Mac.andM;andgt;Vertical applications.andP;  For end users looking to buy finished databaseapplications customized to their particular industry, a vast catalog of PCapplications covering virtually every vertical segment provides a wide rangeof choice.andP;  Vertical Mac databases are few and far between.andM;Bridging the gap.andP;  While each of these barriers has impeded widespread use ofMacs for database applications, the gap is narrowing in every case.andM;MS-DOS interoperability provided by the Mac itself and by several Macintoshdatabase programs means that existing DOS databases can be easily ported toMac systems.andP;  Relational Macintosh databases have matured into second, thirdand fourth iterations that provide all the sophisticated tools and featuresavailable in PC software.andM;Apple has finally begun to address the price differential of Macintoshhardware.andP;  New low-cost Macs slated for the end of this year will makeMac-based multi-user database systems competitive with PC systems.andP;  And withthe growing availability of high-speed Ethernet, token-ring and ARCnetnetworks for the Macintosh, performance is improving.andM;Apple has targeted client/server architecture as an important technology areafor the Macintosh, and support for Macs in such distributed environments islikely to soon match that available for PCs.andP;  The one area where theMacintosh will continue to lag is the availability of Macintosh-basedservers, but with extensive tools to connect to DOS-based or host servers,that may not matter.andM;The acceptance in the DOS world of the advantages of graphical userinterfaces will go a long way toward overcoming the macho factor.andP;  Whilegraphical database applications may be more difficult to develop, theyprovide significant advantages in lower training and support costs for users.andM;Finally, sophisticated development tools for Mac databases are increasinglyavailable from database vendors and third parties.andP;  Also, the list ofvertical solutions available for the Macintosh is growing as a community ofMac database consultants and developers has emerged.andM;Given that the Mac made its first inroads into business as a graphicsmachine, it is not surprising that the last barrier it has to cross is thecore business application of database management.andP;  Now that it can match thesophistication, complexity and performance of PC database standards, the Macappears ready to finally overcome the database gap and take its place as afull partner in business computing.andM;One thousand questionnaires were mailed March 2, 1990, to a random sample ofMacWEEK subscribers involved in purchasing database software for theirorganization.andP;  As of April 3, a total of 513 usable questionnaires had beenreceived.andP;  Excluding four undeliverable surveys, the response rate was 52percent.andM;Each subscriber sampled was involved in purchasing software and hardwareproducts for at least 10 Macintoshes.andP;  Most of their organizations have 10 ormore Macs on site.andP;  Sites with 10 or more Macintoshes make up only 6 percentof all work sites with Macintoshes, yet this 6 percent accounts for 74percent of all Macintoshes installed at business, government or educationalorganizations, according to The Comtec Study, Wave 6 from InfoCorp/TheGartner Group.andM;In the tables and charts that follow, the respondents were involved increating, managing, manipulating or accessing databases for theirorganizations.andP;  -- By Griffin DixandM;Except for HyperCard, the most-used database packages are Claris' FileMakerand ACIUS' 4th Dimension.andP;  The two leading relational packages (the only onesfor which the data was significant) were nearly even in most satisfactionratings, but Fox Software's FoxBASE+/Mac was preferred for its processingspeed.andP;  Mac qualities such as ease of use and learning led the list ofimportant features.andM;A high percentage of Macs used for database work are connected to LANs andalmost half are linked to host computers.andP;  The largest networks usetoken-ring or Ethernet topologies.andP;  The most common method of linking tomainframes is via direct serial connections.andP;  Oracle is most widely used forhost data, followed by two IBM databases.andP;  Apple's Data Access Language,formerly CL/1, is largely unknown at Mac-mainframe sites.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
