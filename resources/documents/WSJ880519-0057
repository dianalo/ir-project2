The Dayton, Ohio-based company, which franchises photo labs, originally had included in its earnings $125,000 in income for selling certain development rights to Canadian Industrial Services Ltd. The SEC, however, said the figure should instead be recorded pro rata as the 40 stores that Canadian Industrial anticipates franchising in Ontario are opened.    As a result, Moto Photo said net income in 1987 was $12,913 instead of the $128,663, or two cents a share, initially reported. Revenue was restated downward to $18.5 million from $18.6 million.    The company also restated its 1988 first-quarter results. Net income was $295,296, or eight cents a share, instead of the $298,421, or eight cents a share, initially reported. Revenue was restated slightly higher to $5,070,029 from $5,066,904. </TEXT></DOC>
