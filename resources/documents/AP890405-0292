The step, criticized by a group of Republican lawmakers whooppose gun control, widened a three-week old import ban to cover 24foreign-made models missed initially, said White House presssecretary Marlin Fitzwater.   Fitzwater called the action, which took effect immediately, a``midcourse correction'' on the way to longer-range measures.   He said the new step should completely dry up the flow offoreign-made semiautomatic weapons while an administration reviewcontinues.   The original suspension of imports, declared March 14 by theTreasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, who oversees the Bureau ofAlcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, covered 80 percent of the imports.Wednesday's action was designed to get at the remaining 20 percent,Fitzwater said.   ``We think we've got 99.9 percent'' of the foreign-madesemiautomatic rifles, said ATF Director Stephen Higgins.   Higgins said the bureau would try to identify additional modelsthat are slight variations of the banned guns to make sure they tooare covered by the 90-day prohibition. But Higgins said he expectedonly a small addition to the list.   A prime reason for the expansion, Fitzwater said, was to fillholes in the original order that had allowed foreign gunmanufacturers not covered by the ban to gain a competitiveadvantage.   Still, Fitzwater conceded ``there is some unfairness'' in thefact that the expanded ban still has no impact on sales ofAmerican-made high-powered rapid-fire rifles.   ``Unfortunately, it is not something we can do anything about,''Fitzwater said. ``To do anything about domestically manufacturedweapons would require a change in the law,'' Fitzwater said.   Colt Industries Inc suspended sales March 15 of its popularAR-15 rifle, the domestically made weapon most similar to theforeign-made assault-style rifles banned the previous day.   Fitzwater declined to say whether seeking such a law changewould be part of President Bush's eventual decision.   Even so, Wednesday's action represented yet another step in theadministration's toughening attitude on such weapons. Bushinitially said he opposed any efforts to outlaw the guns.   Calls for a ban on the weapons had been prompted by scores ofdrug-related shootings and the Jan. 17 slaying of fiveschoolchildren and wounding of 30 others in Stockton, Calif., whengunman Patrick Purdy opened fire on a playground.   According to an ATF study of the guns it traces for lawenforcement agencies nationwide, the number of semiautomaticweapons used in crimes increased 57 percent between 1986 and 1987.   ``With respect to some of the weapons, they are turning up inpercentages which are far disproportionate to the numbers that arein this country,'' Higgins said.   Higgins revealed that Bush had asked him to study a proposal torequire registration of semiautomatic assault rifles. Buyers ofmachine guns and other military-style weapons currently must pay aregistration fee and submit to a background check andfingerprinting.   CBS News reported Wednesday night that national drug controldirector William J. Bennett, whom Bush had asked to recommend whatshould be done about the weapons, told Bush a week ago that``Rambo-looking rifles with a large clip'' should be treated thesame as the machine guns.   However, Larry Cirignano, a Bennett spokesman, said, ``We nevertalk about what we recommend to the president,'' but added that thenetwork report was ``not an accurate depiction'' of Bennett's views.   A group of Republican lawmakers who oppose gun control protestedthe action during a meeting with White House chief of staff JohnSununu.   ``Most of us felt the action today solves no problems,'' saidRep. Larry Craig, R-Idaho. ``Administratively, it's a nightmare.Practically, it solves nothing.''   Craig said that the action was ``a confirmation of the fact thathe (Bush) is parting company'' with gun control opponents.   The initial ban covered five general categories of weapons and25 specific models, including the well-known semiautomatic versionsof the AK-47 assault rifle and the Uzi carbine.   Among the weapons added to the ban Wednesday were the BerettaAR70 and BM59, the Australian Automatic Arms SAR.   Higgins said foreign models account for 20 to 25 percent of thesemiautomatic rifles sold in this country. ATF estimates there are3 million semiautomatic rifles in circulation.   The temporary ban announced last month covered permits to importup to 400,000 assault-style rifles and the latest announcementinvolved up to 250,000 weapons, Higgins said.   Fitzwater said that Treasury was imposing a ban on theadditional 24 weapons ``to review their suitability for sportingpurposes.''   Under the Gun Control Act of 1968, the Treasury Department mayban firearms imports that are not ``particularly suitable for, orreadily adaptable to, sporting purposes.''   Meanwhile, Stockton Mayor Barbara Foss pleaded with lawmakersWednesday to get military-style assault weapons off America'sstreets.   ``We are asking for the same protection for our children and ourcommunities that you have here,'' the mayor told the HouseJudiciary crime subcommittee, which is considering new restrictionson assault weapons.   She pointed to security screening procedures designed to detecthidden weapons carried by visitors to the Capitol and nearbybuildings.   The mayor told of her horror at pulling up in front of theCleveland school on the day of the incident and seeing ``the frontlawn of this normally quiet, neighborhood school strewn withbodies.''   Repercussions of the shooting are still shaking the community,she said.   ``I think of the mother who holds her hand over her heart toease the pain,'' she said. ``I think of the little boy whose sisterwas killed and who implores her to return whenever the news isreplayed and he sees her on television. ... Every unknown person onthe playgrounds is now a threat. A car backfiring sends studentsunder their desks.''   Rep. William J. Hughes, D-N.J., the subcommittee chairman, saidthe lawmakers will have a tough job in striking a balance betweenimposing new safeguards and maintaining the rights of legitimatefirearms owners.   ``America has a love affair with cars and guns, and anytime wedeal with guns we generally generate more heat than light,'' Hughessaid.   Fitzwater said, ``we want to keep our options open'' on whatnext step the administration should take.   ``There has been an educational process here, in which all of ushave learned more about these weapons _ how they are being used andtheir danger,'' Fitzwater said. ``There has indeed been aneducation and a heightened awareness of this issue.''   Fitzwater said that the 90-day review of the entire subjectordered by Bush on March 14 is moving along quickly.   Other firearms listed by the Treasury Department as added to theban by Wednesday's action include: Algimec AGM-1, AR-180, CISSR-88, HK-91, HK-93, HK-94, AK-22, AP-74, Galil-22, G3-SA, K-1,K-2, AR-100, M-14S, MAS-223, SIG 550SP, SIG 551SP, SKS withdetachable magazine, M16-33, Unique F-11 and Erma EM1.22.</TEXT></DOC>
