A secondaryobjective was to further delineate statistical models of N mineralizationpotential (N{sub 0}) and the mineralization rate constants k and h. TheGlendale clay soil (fine-silty, mixed thermic, Typic Torrifluvents),with either no previous sludge amendment or sludge applied at the rateof 67.3 Mg ha{sup -1} in 1982 or 1983 in the field, was freshly amendedwith 30 g kg{sup -1} of gamma irradiated, dried, anaerobically digestedsewage sludge in 1985. Triplicate samples of each soil (unamended, amendedin 1982, and amended in 1983) and each sludge treatment (no amendmentand freshly amended) were incubated aerobically for 16 wk at 0.01-MPamoisture potential and 35{sup 0}C. Periodically the soils were leachedwith 0.01 M CaCl{sub 2}, and the leachate was analyzed for inorganicand organic N. Previous sludge amendment had no effect on the mineralizationof fresh sludge. Soils previously amended in 1982 and 1983 leached 56to 60 mg kg{sup -1} more NO{sub 3}{sup -} + NO{sub 2}{sup -} than unamendedor freshly amended soils never amended with sludge. Total organic N mineralizationaveraged 65.4% and was independent of soil amendment history or freshsludge amendment. Values of N{sub 0}, k, and h were estimated by nonlinearleast squares for several nonlinear models. The best fit of the dataresulted from modeling N mineralization as the sum of an exponentialequation (of the rapidly decaying organic N fraction) and a constant(of the slowly decaying organic N fraction).</TEXT></DOC>
