President Alfredo Cristiani declared a nationwide curfew andstate of siege. Cristiani's official residence was among thetargets of the rebels' offensive, launched Saturday night. He wasat his private home and was unhurt.   At least 317 people were wounded in the offensive, whichcontinued into early Monday, according to reports from hospitalsand the military.   An American teacher was among the dead.   Rebels claimed 400 soldiers were killed or wounded in whatofficials called the broadest series of attacks in the city of 1million in a decade of fighting. It was the biggest coordinatedattack since an offensive in the provinces in 1981.   There were reports of fighting in four of the country's 14provinces, including the northern section of San Salvador, much ofwhich was being held by heavily armed rebels.   ``The boys are in the high buildings. They have snipers who havethe soldiers controlled,'' a woman who fled the area said.   In the area's Metropolis neighborhood, residents helped rebelsdig trenches and soldiers stayed at a distance, reporters whoentered the area said.   In at least one neighborhood they occupied, rebels held meetingsto tell residents how to protect themselves from air attacks andother fighting.   A nurse at the Rosales Hospital said it was running short ofsome supplies.   ``Since last night, they have not stopped bringing in wounded,''said the nurse, who gave her name only as Mrs. Luna.   The international airport was closed after militaryinstallations were attacked by mortar fire but opened brieflySunday for arriving flights. Some passengers were stranded becausethere were no taxis to take them into San Salvador, a 45-minutedrive away.   Cristiani announced a 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew and the state ofsiege in an address on radio and television. The state of siegerestricts transit, the freedom of expression, rights of assemblyand privacy of correspondence.   ``You must heed the call to not go out in the streets, to stayin your houses or where you are right now,'' Cristiani said. ``Theterrorists must know that there are judicial tools to fight theseirrational attacks.''   The armed forces press office said 26 soldiers had been killedand 65 wounded. Guerrilla deaths totaled 93 and 55 were wounded, itsaid. Rebels gave no figures on their own casualties.   The armed forces said eight civilians were killed and 35 wounded.   Carlos Mendoza, spokesman for the Salvadoran Red Cross, said ina telephone interview that at least 20 civilians had been killed.   Among those killed Saturday night was a U.S. citizen who taughtat the American High School in San Salvador, according to U.S.Embassy spokesman Barry Jacobs. Jacobs gave no details and said thevictim's name was being withheld pending notification of familymembers.   The attacks came three days after the rebel Farabundo MartiLiberation Front vowed to intensify the insurgency, in which morethan 70,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed.   Rebel leaders on Wednesday also pulled out of a a third round ofpeace talks with the U.S.-backed government, claiming Cristiani'srightist administration had not been serious about negotiating anend to the conflict.   In Washington, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney told NBC he did notbelieve U.S. military would get involved, and he called the offense``a move of desperation by the guerrillas.''   In a broadcast over their clandestine Radio Venceremos, theguerrillas said the San Salvador attacks were part of a nationaloffensive called ``Remove the fascists, Febe Elizabeth lives.''   Febe Elizabeth Velazquez was a union leader who perished in anOct. 31 explosion at the National Federation of Salvadoran Workers.The rebels claim the government was behind that attack, whichkilled 10 people and wounded more than 30.   ``Today we are fighting against misery, against those who stayin power through savagery aimed at churches, universities,opposition political parties, guilds, unions and dissidentsectors,'' the rebel broadcast said.   Government troops and a tank entered El Salvador NationalUniversity Sunday and damaged some buildings when they opened fire,a photographer said.   Twelve students and workers were detained and taken by truck toa military base, according to the photographer. He said theprisoners were accused of harboring guerrillas.   A guerrilla leader who identified himself as Commander Fernandeztold reporters Sunday, ``Here we will die fighting. They won'tremove us from here.''   At a news conference at a home in northern San Salvador, theguerrilla leader said, ``This is the start of the counteroffensive.We won't leave until the government gives up or calls us to thenegotiating table.''   In Managua, Nicaragua, the government-run radio Voice ofNicaragua broadcast a statement by Salvadoran guerrillas warningcivilians living near military installations to leave.   The rebel statement also warned Salvadorans that areas neardowned power lines had been mined and said first-aid vehiclesshould not transport military casualties. It said gasoline stationsshould close immediately and all transportation should stop atmidnight.   Military headquarters in the eastern cities of San Miguel andUsulutan were attacked, said Col. Rene Ponce, chief of the jointchiefs of staff.   He said other rebel targets included the home of the presidentof the legislative assembly, Ricardo Alvarenga; the 1st InfantryBrigade; police headquarters in the Mejicanos neighborhood; the 3rdInfantry Brigade in San Miguel, and the 6th Brigade in Usulutan.   Alvarenga escaped injury but the attack on his house left atleast one guerrilla dead and two guards wounded, hospital officialssaid.
