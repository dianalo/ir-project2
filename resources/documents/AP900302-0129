(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Billy Joel says he didn't start the fire,but he certainly helped fan one under Cloquet High School freshmanKevin Shutes.   Shutes correctly identified and described 116 of the 119 people,places and events in Joel's hit song, ``We Didn't Light the Fire,''in a trivia contest sponsored by the Carlton County HistoricalSociety.   His reward included the $25 top prize, a year's membership inthe society, free pizzas, car washes and movie passes.   ``I thought all the entrants really did a great job,'' said thesociety's director Ellen Quinn, who organized the contest to helpbroaden the students' knowledge of history.   ``I was surprised by the amount of time they put in and howcomplete their answers were,'' she said Thursday. Shutes ``had verycomplete answers and even went into a little commentary.''   Shutes described ``Woodstock,'' a word in the song, as ``amassive rock 'n' roll orgy that involved 500,000 young people outfor a good time. They completely took over the area and indulged insex and drugs freely. The sanitary conditions were said to havebeen disgusting.''   He identified ``Studebaker'' as ``a short-lived product of thecar industry. A free pony was offered to consumers who purchasedthe car.''   For extra credit, Shutes noted singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, whogets a mention in the song, was born Duluth and reared in Hibbing.   The three references he stumbled on were: ``Sugar Ray,'' ``PopePaul,'' and ``Santayana.'' He incorrectly identified boxingchampion Sugar Ray Robinson as a baseball player; he confused PopePaul VI of Italy with John Paul II, as the first Polish pope, andmisidentified philospher George Santayana as the 1960s rock bandSantana.</TEXT><DATELINE>ASPEN, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A woman who alleges she was sexuallyassaulted by author Hunter S. Thompson admits she produced X-ratedmovies in the 1970s. But she claims not to know where the ``gonzo''journalist got the idea that she's now in the sex-aids trade.   Gail M. Palmer-Slater of St. Clair, Mich., alleged she went toThompson's Woody Creek home on Feb. 21 to conduct a ``professionalinterview'' because she idolized him, she said in an interviewThursday with the Aspen Times Daily.   She said when she refused to join him in his hot tub, heallegedly punched her and grabbed her breast.   Thompson, the author of ``Fear and Loathing on the CampaignTrail,'' told the newspaper that Palmer-Slater ``was real drunk,sloppy drunk'' and pressured him to have sex with her.   ``I pushed her away from me,'' he said. ``She went backward andone hand brushed her breast.''   Thompson, who lives near Aspen, was arrested Monday on sexassault and simple assault charges, and later freed on $2,000 bond.He is expected to enter a plea at a March 13 hearing.   He said Palmer-Slater came to his house to talk about a newbusiness venture.   ``She wanted me to help her get publicity for her business,which is women's lingerie and dildos,'' Thompson said.   Thompson said he had seen porno videotapes of Slater made in themid-1970s, when she was in her 20s. Slater said she was a video andfilm producer in the 1970s and that she sometimes appeared in theproductions.   Jim Holliday, author of ``Only the Best,'' a history of the pornfilm industry, said a woman named Gail Palmer produced and directedporn films in the 1970s, including ``The Erotic Adventures ofCandy'' and ``Candy Goes to Hollywood'' in 1978.</TEXT></DOC>
