Reflecting his 12 years on the federal bench, the 51-year-old Californian was judicious in describing some of his legal views on abortion, civil rights and criminal and business issues. Although he didn't dodge questions that may one day arise in court cases, he often steered clear of taking a hard stand.    The Senate Judiciary Committee hopes, in two days of testimony from Judge Kennedy, to gain insight into his judicial philosophy, which is conservative but not sharply defined. So far, there appears to be nothing to upset President Reagan's third try to get a Supreme Court nominee confirmed to succeed retired Justice Lewis Powell.    In an atmosphere far more relaxed than the contentious hearings for Robert Bork, who was rejected for the high court seat by the Senate in October, Judge Kennedy avoided one of Judge Bork's fatal pitfalls by cautiously conceding that &quot;there is a zone of liberty&quot; that protects individual rights, even though they're not specifically mentioned in the Constitution.    The high court, for example, in a landmark decision, relied on a right to privacy to recognize a woman's right to an abortion. A central issue at Judge Bork's hearings was his stand that the court has found too broad a right to privacy in the Constitution.    At the hearing yesterday, Judge Kennedy said, &quot;It seems to me that most Americans, most lawyers, most judges believe liberty includes protection of a value we know as privacy.&quot;    &quot;There is a zone of liberty,&quot; he added, &quot;. . . where a line is drawn where the individual can tell the government, 'Beyond this line, you may not go.' The great question is where to draw that line.&quot;    The gray-haired jurist said neither the White House nor the Justice Department, in interviewing him for the Supreme Court post, has asked for his views on issues such as abortion. Opponents of both Judges Bork and Douglas Ginsburg, who withdrew his nomination to the Supreme Court, fear that the White House has been fishing for a nominee who would follow a specific agenda. &quot;No such questions were asked and no such commitments were offered,&quot; Judge Kennedy said.    The importance of Judge Kennedy's potential as a swing vote on a closely divided Supreme Court was underscored yesterday when the court released a 4-4 decision in an Illinois abortion case just as the confirmation hearings opened across the street.    Judge Kennedy, a Catholic, insisted that he has never signaled his views on abortion to Sen. Jesse Helms (R., N.C.), who has interpreted private remarks by the judge as being anti-abortion. &quot;I don't have such (fixed) views on privacy or abortion,&quot; the appeals court judge said. &quot;It would be highly improper for any judge to allow his own personal or private views to enter into a judicial matter.&quot;    Appearing at ease with the committee, Judge Kennedy also sought to allay concerns that he takes a narrow view of civil rights laws. He said he quit three private clubs because they discriminated against women or minorities. Although he said the clubs didn't intentionally discriminate, &quot;it's no question that the injury and personal hurt can be there regardless of the motivation.&quot; He said he quit one club just before he was nominated to the Supreme Court last month because it wouldn't be fair to the Reagan administration or the Senate to make club membership an issue in his confirmation.    Under questioning from Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.), Judge Kennedy said he doesn't quibble with two Supreme Court decisions overturning his own appellate rulings that would have restricted protections for the handicapped and for minority home buyers. He said fair-housing laws and statutes for the handicapped &quot;must be generously enforced or people are going to get hurt.&quot;    On the question of whether sex discrimination should be examined as rigorously as racial bias under the 14th Amendment's guarantee of &quot;equal protection,&quot; Judge Kennedy said the law is &quot;in a state of evolution&quot; that requires more cases to resolve.    Most of the civil rights groups that opposed Judge Bork have remained silent so far about Judge Kennedy. Only the National Organization for Women, a chief women's rights group, has come out against the nominee. But civil rights leaders plan to meet tonight after the scheduled conclusion of Judge Kennedy's testimony to decide whether to oppose him or remain out of the fight.    In tones sure to appeal to law-and-order conservatives, Judge Kennedy said that rules for police on search and seizure &quot;should be pragmatic . . . and workable&quot; and &quot;if the rules aren't working, they should be changed.&quot; He also applauded growing recognition in the courts of the rights of crime victims.    On antitrust matters, he advocated taking a case-by-case approach but stressed that he favors strict enforcement of laws covering clearly anti-competitive practices, such as price fixing.    The hearings are expected to last through Thursday. The committee doesn't plan to vote, however, until late January, with a vote in the full Senate shortly afterward.    ---   Stephen Wermiel contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
