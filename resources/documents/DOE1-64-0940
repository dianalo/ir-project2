Rainwater samples were chemicallyanalyzed for pH, major ions and trace metals (via INAA). Results arepresented for a precipitation event sampled by the network on February14-15, 1985. Two collectors were operated at each site with these pairedresults statistically screened for potential contamination based on independentlymeasured experimental uncertainties. Geographical mapping of rainwaterconcentrations demonstrated a clear enhancement of H/sup +/, excess ofSO/sub 4//sup =/, and trace metals downwind of the smelter. Principalcomponent analysis revealed the influence of seasalt, crustal material,and a component interpreted to represent smelter SO/sub 2/ and tracemetal emissions.</TEXT></DOC>
