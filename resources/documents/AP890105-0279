By a 5-0 vote, the commission, which regulates futures andcommodity options markets, proposed a rule and issued aninterpretative letter removing some kinds of so-called ``hybridinstruments'' from CFTC regulation.   Until now, the commission has granted about 15 case-by-caseexceptions for hybrids that are predominantly a security or timedeposit. The interpretative letter and proposed rule set out thestandards for further exemptions from CFTC oversight.   Commission Chairwoman Wendy L. Gramm said the new rules are aimedat removing the ``regulatory uncertainty'' that has discouraged thedevelopment of new products. However, she said, the rules do notmean hybrids will go unregulated.   In the case of securities, the instruments must be regulated bythe Securities and Exchange Commission. In the case of bankdeposits, the issuing institution must be regulated by the FederalDeposit Insurance Corp. The rules do not provide an exception forinstruments offered by savings institutions.   ``Today's releases represent an attempt to provide somestability. ... They reduce regulatory duplications, but they alsoeliminate regulatory gaps,'' Ms. Gramm said.   The interpretative letter takes effect immediately but is subjectto change based on public comments offered in the next 45 days. Therelated regulation being proposed will be open for public commentfor the same period and the commission must adopt a final versionbefore it takes effect.   Hybrid instruments combine the characteristics of debt securitiessuch as bonds or bank time deposits with certain characteristics offutures or commodity options.   Examples include a bank deposit with its principal indexed to theexchange rate of the dollar and Japanese yen or a corporate notewith its yield tied to the price of gold or oil. Another kind ofhybrid guarantees a set rate of return over inflation.   Robert Mackay, the commission's chief of staff, speculated thatmany U.S. banks will take advantage of the new rules becausestarting Dec. 31 the Federal Reserve will allow them to offerdeposit accounts in foreign currencies.   He said corporations and financial institutions potentially couldraise billions of dollars with hybrid instruments.   Robert R. Davis, a CFTC member since 1984, said Thursday's action``may represent the most significant actions taken by the commissionduring my tenure.''</TEXT></DOC>
