The shells are in development and the air-to-surface missile isclose to that stage, the officials said.   The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity in Washingtonas NATO leaders in Brussels ended their two-day summit, said majordecisions remain, however, on how to replace the 75-mile-range,ground-launched Lance missile.   Deployment of a replacement for the Lance could come as late as1995, if ever, they said.   ``NATO is still committed to the modernization, but there isn'tany decision facing the alliance now on Lance replacement,'' oneofficial said.   What to do about short-range systems has become a bigger issuein NATO, now that a U.S.-Soviet treaty would eliminate missilescapable of hitting targets 300 to 3,120 miles away. The short-rangearms would be the only nuclear weapons left in Western Europe.   As promised at a defense ministers' meeting in Montebello,Canada, in 1983, NATO already has reduced the number of short-rangesystems below a 4,600 ceiling. The other half of the Montebellodecision is pending. It calls for:   _ New, more accurate and reliable artillery shells, notably for155-millimeter howitzers, capable of hitting targets 10-15 milesaway. Research is finished and that weapon is in the earlydevelopment stage.   _ A new air-to-surface missile with a range of about 350 miles.The could be in the development stage shortly, especially if afinal decision is reached to simply modify existing air-launchedcruise missiles. The weapons would be deployed on U.S. F-16s,F-111s, West German Torndados and other fighter-bombers.   _ A replacement for Lance missile, a 1960s generation weapondeployed in 1972. There are 88 Lance launchers in Western Europeand NATO envisions replacing them with equipment capable of firinga missile about 130 miles. The replacement is in the early designstage.   In a summit-ending communique, President Reagan and the other 15leaders said ``we are determined to sustain the requisite effortsto ensure the continued viability, credibility and effectiveness ofour conventional and nuclear forces, including the nuclear forcesin Europe which together provide the guarantee of our commonsecurity.''   The final summit communique avoided use of the wordmodernization, to which West Germany objects. Instead, the documentsaid NATO will maintain ``an appropriate mix of adequate andeffective nuclear and conventional forces which will continue to bekept up to date where necessary.''   Of the NATO allies, West Germany is the most concerned about thepace of modernization. Many political figures there would preferless talk about nuclear improvements and more talk aboutnegotiations with the Soviets to reduce the number of short-rangeweapons on both sides.   In deference to West Germany, officials before and after thesummit took pains to stress the fact that the Lance replacement,the most powerful of the weapons, has not even been built, muchless set for deployment.   NATO Secretary General Lord Carrington said the allies wereconcerned that some people might think ``modernization'' mightsignal introduction of new, more destructive weapons.``Modernization actually means weapons that are more accurate andpossibly less destructive,'' he said.   Frank Gaffney, a former deputy assistant secretary of defenseand advocate of rapid-as-possible improvements in the short-rangesystems, said Thursday deployment of the new weapons would enhancethe chances of getting an agreement at future arms talks with theSoviets.   The Pentagon's 1987 report on Soviet military power said Eastbloc forces have ``a substantial numerical superiority'' inshort-range nuclear forces.</TEXT></DOC>
