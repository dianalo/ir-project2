The battle was launched by the Toronto financiers IanDelaney, Bruce Walter and Eric Sprott, who accused Sherritt'smanagers of running the nickel refining and fertilizercompany unimaginatively and without direction. Theymaintained that the management group, by holding less than 1%of Sherritt's shares, couldn't be committed to making thewidely held company a success.</LP><TEXT>   Though the dissidents hold only 5.4% of Sherritt, theymanaged to round enough support from institutional holders towin the proxy battle by a small margin, with 53% of the votescast. The group replaced Sherritt's board with its ownnominees.   Mr. Delaney said he will assume the posts of president andchief executive officer. He said that a board meeting will beheld shortly to elect a president, and that the post islikely to go to Mr. Walter.   Sherritt's former president and chief executive, CharlesHeinrich, asked shareholders to vote against the dissidents,on grounds that they don't have any background in Sherritt'skey industries. They &quot;haven't offered even one specificworkable element of a plan that differs in any real way fromthe plan being implemented&quot; by the company, he said.   In their information circular, the dissidents said theywould seek joint-venture partners, acquisitions and marketingchanges, but didn't offer specifics. Mr. Delaney declined tocomment on changes the new directors will make, but he saidthere won't be any drastic changes in operations immediately.He said the &quot;near-term problem is to get the company on astable&quot; footing. &quot;Sherritt runs efficently,&quot; he said. &quot;Theproblem with Sherritt has always been the strategicdirection.&quot;   Sherritt has been hit hard by downturns in its cyclicalbusinesses. It lost a key supply of nickel feed last year andhas been struggling to keep its refinery operating at fullcapacity.   In this year's first six months, Sherritt's net incomeplunged 88% to C$4.1 million (US$3.5 million), or 16 Canadiancents (14 U.S. cents) a share, from a year earlier.   In the past 52 weeks, Sherritt's stock price has fallenfrom a high of C$13.50 to a low of C$7. On the Toronto StockExchange yesterday, the stock closed at C$8.25, up 25Canadian cents.   Mr. Delaney said that Sherritt will proceed with its planto move its head office to Edmonton, Alberta, to be closer toits operations, but that he will run the company fromToronto.   Mr. Heinrich said he doesn't know what he will do now,though Mr. Delaney said a Sherritt executive position will beavailable to him.</TEXT></DOC>
