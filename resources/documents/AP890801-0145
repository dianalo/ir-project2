LaBELLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Tuesday hisgovernment was making contacts in an effort to free hostages inLebanon, and sources said direct approaches were made to LebaneseShiite Moslems for a prisoner swap.   Israeli officials said it remained willing to exchange a Moslemcleric kidnapped by Israel, and other Lebanese Shiite prisoners,for Israeli soldiers and Western hostages. The radical Shiite groupHezbollah, or Party of God, issued a statement spurning the deal.   Shamir's spokesman, Avi Pazner, called the offer humanitarianand fair, and added: ``We believe it is not Hezbollah's last word.''   Israel television said the army would let the InternationalCommittee of the Red Cross visit the kidnapped Lebanese clergymenand his two abducted assistants if Shiite groups allowed a RedCross visit to three Israeli soldiers believed to be held captivein south Lebanon.   A Defense Ministry spokesman confirmed the report but would notgive details.   Israel insisted it would not free Sheik Abdul Karim Obeiddespite threats by Shiite kidnappers to kill Western hostages inLebanon.   When asked by the national news agency Itim whether Obeid mightbe turned over to U.S. authorities, Shamir replied he could not saywhat might be done.   The Israelis say Obeid planned guerrilla attacks on Israel anddirected the kidnapping in February 1988 of Lt. Col. William R.Higgins, a U.S. Marine officer on U.N. duty in south Lebanon.   On Monday, Higgins' captors said they had hanged him andreleased a poor-quality videotape showing a man on a gallows. Thekidnappers said he was hanged in retaliation for Obeid's abduction,but there have been reports Higgins was killed several months ago.   Shamir said Tuesday night that Higgins was ``apparently dead,''and added: ``We express our deep sorrow to his family and theAmerican people.''   During a factory tour earlier, Shamir said there was ``a commoninterest and a common goal'' between Israel and the United Stateson freeing hostages, but noted the reason for capturing Obeid wasto free the three Israeli soldiers held in south Lebanon.   ``The only purpose of our operation was to free our capturedsoldiers,'' he said. ``If, at the same time, we manage to set freeother hostages, we will be happy.''   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens told reporters in Jerusalem thatIsrael viewed the new death threats as ``disinformation.''   ``We do not have much faith in the truthfulness of theannouncements that come from these organizations,'' he said. ``Itwould probably not be very wise to take any action based on thatinformation.''   Itim, the Israeli news agency, reported Tuesday that Shamir wasmaking contacts to free Western captives, and he said on hisfactory tour: ``There are permanent contacts with various factorsabout the release of the hostages.''   Pazner said the contacts were indirect, through the UnitedStates and international organizations.   Some Israeli sources, speaking privately, said talks were beingheld directly with Lebanese Shiites about the proposedprisoner-hostage trade.   Security sources said Israel is believed to hold 50-60 LebaneseShiite Moslems in Israel and, through its surrogate South LebanonArmy militia, about 300 in southern Lebanon.   Israel made the offer to free Shiite prisoners in exchange forits soldiers and foreign hostages on Monday, before theannouncement that Higgins had been killed.   Shamir defended the abduction of Obeid as ``a strong, energeticeffort'' to help free the captured soldiers.   ``If need be we will take stronger steps,'' he told a ceremonyin Jerusalem marking the 49th anniversary of the death of Israelipioneer Zeev Jabotinsky.</TEXT></DOC>
