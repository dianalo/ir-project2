The state charged the poultry producer with allowingworking conditions that led to such disorders as carpaltunnel syndrome, and with failing to report the workers'medical difficulties.</LP><TEXT>   Carpal tunnel syndrome, which can be crippling, involvesthe compression of a main nerve that passes through thewrist. It is caused by frequent, repeated, unnatural hand orwrist motions, such as some motions that are often requiredin poultry processing.   Perdue, which previously contested the citations by thestate Department of Labor, said its plants over the past yearhave put new processing methods into effect, includingautomating difficult jobs, rotating work and educatingworkers on how to reduce the motion disorders. The company,based in Salisbury, Md., said its incidence of cumulativetrauma disorders is less than half the industry average andcontinues to decline steadily.   Under the agreement with North Carolina's occupationalhealth and safety agency, Perdue will conduct annual surveysover four years of the extent of worker injuries; involveworkers in the studies; recognize that cumulative traumadisorders are a prevalent occupational illness in poultryprocessing, and develop a model for curbing the disorder.   Joining in the agreement were the Occupational Safety andHealth Law Center, Washington, D.C., and seven Perdue workersrepresented by the law group.   The Perdue investigation was an outgrowth of hearings oncumulative trauma disorders by a House employmentsubcommittee in 1989.</TEXT></DOC>
