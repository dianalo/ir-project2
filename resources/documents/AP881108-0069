(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Officials suspect an exhaust-stack leak wasresponsible for traces of plutonium found on 18 employees at theSavannah River nuclear materials plant in recent weeks.   And in Golden, Colo., a federal inspector said several storagesites at the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant were becomingdangerously overcrowded, greatly increasing the chance of anaccident involving radioactive and hazardous wastes there.   At Savannah River, a Du Pont company spokesman said Monday thatworkers in the laboratory from which the suspect exhaust comesanalyze samples of nuclear materials produced by the plant,including solutions that contain plutonium.   It was discovered Oct. 26 that the workers had plutonium traceson their hands and shoes.   There are a series of valves through which the plutonium may haveentered the air from the 75-foot stack. Air from those valves is nowbeing sent through an extra sand filter, said Clif Webb, spokesmanfor Du Pont, which operates the facility for the U.S. Department ofEnergy.   The plant in Aiken County, S.C., near the Georgia border,produces plutonium and tritium for the nation's nuclear weapons.   Since April, all three Savannah River reactors have been shutdown for maintenance amid questions of safety. A number ofnear-accidents and several releases of radioactive materials havebeen disclosed.   The search for the Oct. 26 leak concentrated during the weekendon the laboratory in the F-area, the plant's chemical separationsfacility.   ``We're continuing to investigate it,'' Webb said. ``But we feelcertain that that is the source point.''   He said air leaving the room will now go through a sand filterbefore it is released into the outside air. The air from the roomalready goes through two other filters.   Contamination was found on the shoes of one other worker over theweekend, Webb said. That made 18 employees who came in contact withthe contamination since it was first discovered.   Webb said the radiation exposure was about 1 microcurie. Incomparison, an average smoke alarm gives off about 3 microcuries,Webb said.   ``We're talking about a very low release, no health threat to theemployees or the public,'' Webb said.   In Colorado, officials from the state health department and U.S.Environmental Protection Agency found during a visit last week thatfive of 14 permitted storage areas are too crowded, said Nat Miullo,who oversees Rocky Flats for the EPA.   The waste is being kept in steel crates and barrels.   ``Increasingly crowded conditions are decreasing the facility'sability to react in the event of an incident,'' Miullo said.   Fred Dowset, who heads the Health Department's waste managementunit, declined comment on specifics of his inspection.   Dowset acknowledged, however, that some storage areas werecrowded, and cited inadequate aisle space as one concern.   The chief cause of the crisis was a ban last month by Idaho Gov.Cecil Andrus against all waste shipments. The Idaho NationalEngineering Laboratory near Idaho Falls has stored Rocky Flats wastefor 20 years.   Andrus' ban was prompted by repeated delays in the opening of theWaste Isolation Pilot Plant, a permanent disposal site nearCarlsbad, New Mexico. The facility was supposed to begin acceptingwaste from Idaho last month. But political bickering andenvironmental concerns have pushed back its opening at least untilearly next year.</TEXT></DOC>
