In her third day of cross-examination by the defense in statecourt Tuesday, Hedda Nussbaum admitted using heroin, cocaine andLSD, and said defendant Joel Steinberg told her she had the power toput people in a trance.   Steinberg's attorney, Ira London, attempted to discredit Ms.Nussbaum's testimony for the prosecution with repeated questionsabout drug use, hypnotism and an imaginary cult.   Steinberg, a 47-year-old disbarred lawyer, is charged with murderin the November 1987 beating death of Lisa Steinberg, whom heillegally obtained at birth from an unmarried teen-ager.   Lisa's death in an affluent, well-educated household shocked manyand led to a re-examination of the duty and ability of neighbors,teachers and social workers to recognize and report evidence ofchild abuse.   Ms. Nussbaum, the prosecution's star witness, has directlyimplicated Steinberg in the death, saying he admitted knocking Lisadown the night the girl was fatally injured.   Ms. Nussbaum said Tuesday that Steinberg made her believe thathypnotism and programming by the imaginary cult had made her have``sex with everybody in the world.''   ``I was hypnotizing everyone ... and was using them sexually,''she said.   At that point Ms. Nussbaum smiled. ``The absurdity of the wholething just hit me,'' she said as she dabbed her left eye with atissue. The tear duct, allegedly ruptured by a Steinberg beating,drains continuously.   Ms. Nussbaum said the sexual abuse occurred in 1983, when Lisaspent three weeks at the home of a doctor who often joined her andSteinberg in cocaine parties.   She said the doctor later told her and Steinberg during an``encounter session'' that his wife had sexually abused the girl.   Ms. Nussbaum said she showed Steinberg a bruise on Lisa's vaginabut ``he didn't take any action or do anything about it.''   She admitted that she did not take Lisa to a doctor or hospital.   ``No, no,'' Ms. Nussbaum said. ``I took her to Joel.''   She said she took no action against the couple and did nothing toensure that Lisa had not been harmed physically or emotionally.   Ms. Nussbaum glanced several times at the defense table, whereSteinberg sat, either gazing at her intently or scribbling notes.   Asked by London about books on demonology, necromancy and otheroccult subjects that police found at the apartment she shared withSteinberg, she said they were research materials for a book ofhorror stories she was writing for teen-agers.   Ms. Nussbaum, a children's book editor, denied that she wasinterested in satanic cults and witchcraft.   She said she and Steinberg took precautions against posthypnoticbuzzwords they believed could trigger certain actions when heard bya subject.   Ms. Nussbaum said Steinberg also warned her that her own sister,Judy Liebman, ``was a member of this cult and could buzz me.''   Ms. Liebman, watching the trial from a front row seat, said,``It's crazy but it was one of his (Steinberg's) ways of controllingher.''   London also tried to show that Steinberg was irrational. Hefrequently asked Ms. Nussbaum whether Steinberg actually believedthe incredible things he told her. She said she did not know.   On Monday, London asked for permission to present a belatedinsanity defense. State judge Harold Rothwax denied the request.</TEXT></DOC>
