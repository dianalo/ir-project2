SNIFFEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The pay raise awaiting President Bush'ssignature would stop able-bodied, semiretired federal judges fromcollecting pay raises while doing no judicial work.   But an exception would be granted for former Chief JusticeWarren Burger and any others who, like him, work full-time on afederal or state entity outside the judicial system.   The pay package for members of Congress, judges and seniorexecutives, approved by Congress early Saturday sent to Bush,contains a bipartisan proposal to alter the pay provisions forsenior judges _ those who opt for a reduced workload after theyreach age 65 with 15 years experience.   To get full raises, senior judges would have to do theequivalent of three months of judicial work a year or be disabled.Healthy senior judges who did not work that minimum would continueto receive the full pay they got before they stopped working, plusany subsequent cost-of-living increases.   The proposal to restrict pay raises for non-working seniorjudges was introduced by Reps. Robert Kastenmeier, D-Wis., andCarlos Moorhead, R-Calif., chairman and ranking Republican on theHouse courts subcommittee, last April after The Associated Pressfound that nearly 20 percent of the 277 senior judges did nojudicial work.   Since then, drafters added one provision which, Kastenmeierconceded, would have the effect of preserving the pay raise forformer Chief Justice Warren Burger, who has not heard a case sincestepping down in 1986. Since then, he has been chairman of thebicentennial of the Constitution and Bill of Rights. The panelcontinues through 1991.   The provision allows full pay raises for senior judges, likeBurger, who work full-time ``for a federal or state governmentalentity.'' One source, who declined to be named, said Burger's viewsthat senior judges ought to get full pay raises for such work hadbeen made known to the Congress.   As a result, Burger's pay, and that of current Chief JusticeWilliam Rehnquist, would rise from $115,000 now to $124,000 inJanuary and at least $155,000 on Jan. 1991.   The bill would boost the salaries of federal district judgesfrom $89,500 to $120,800 in January and at least $124,400 inJanuary, 1991. Appeals courts salaries would rise from $95,000 to$102,500 and then at least to $128,100. Supreme Court justiceswould go from $110,000 to $118,700 and at least to $148,400.   The final figures in all four categories are contingent oninflation and are likely to be increased as a result of acost-of-living increase in January 1991, currently expected to bearound 3 percent.   Kastenmeier said last week that, ``The only judges who will notreceive the raise are those who should not receive it: the ones ingood health who affirmatively opt not to work.''   Nevertheless, spokesmen for the federal judiciary have bitterlyopposed any curtailment in raises for any category of senior judge.As the bill neared passage, sources said, representatives of thejudiciary tried without success to find support for an amendmentthat would exempt all current judges from the restrictions andapply them only to future appointees.   Members of Kastenmeier's subcommittee told judicial leaders at ahearing last April that The Associated Press stories about the payof senior judges had prompted a torrent of constituent complaintsand introduction of the legislation.   The AP reported previously unpublished federal figures from 1987that showed that 20 percent of the 306 senior judges that year didno judicial work.   An Associated Press survey of all senior judges in February andMarch of this year found that 17 percent of 277 senior judges didno judicial work. The AP survey credited judges for dormant casesstill on their dockets, which the earlier government data had not.   Under the new rules, senior judges could fulfill their workrequirement by hearing cases in court or by writing opinions andhandling settlements and motions. In either case, the chief judgeof their circuit would have to certify that they had done duringthe year an amount of work equal to that which an active judgewould complete in three months.   They also could complete the requirement for full raises byworking full-time on administrative duties directly related to theoperation of the courts, such as at the Federal Judicial Center.   Senior judges who fail to meet the work requirement as a resultof either temporary or permanent disability would continue toreceive all raises given full-time judges.</TEXT></DOC>
