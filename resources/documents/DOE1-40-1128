The authors investigatedthe interaction of heat with cell calcium and calmodulin function. /sup45/Ca/sup ++/ flux was measured at 37{sup 0}C in CHO monolayers, understeady state conditions. External Ca/sup ++/ was removed with LaCl/sub3/ at 0{sup 0}C and total internal Ca/sup ++/ assayed. Heat caused anincrease in /sup 45/Ca/sup ++/ exchange influx. Calcium influx was adose dependent and saturable process. Mild heat treatments (45{sup 0}C/7.5,15 min) seemed to primarily affect the initial rate of uptake (K/subm/) whereas more severe heat treatments (45{sup 0}C/30 min) appearedto increase total capacity (V/sub max/). The authors further investigatedthe interaction of calcium and heat with Ca/sup ++/-active agents. TMB-8a Ca/sup ++/ antagonist that is thought to inhibit release of intracellularbound calcium, sensitized cells to heat. The calcium ionophore, A23187also sensitized cells to heat. Paradoxically, cells suspended in Ca/sup++/ free medium were extremely heat sensitive compared to controls. Theywere also interested in the role of calcium/calmodulin in the inductionand expression of thermal resistance. Preliminary data suggest that exposureto the specific calmodulin inhibitor W/sub 7/ may attenuate the expressionof thermotolerance. The data suggest a complex role for Ca/sup ++//calmodulinin the mediation of thermal injury and death as well as in the inductionof heat resistance. In addition Ca/sup ++/ antagonists may prove to beuseful adjuncts in cancer treatment with hyperthermia.</TEXT></DOC>
