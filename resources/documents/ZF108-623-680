 The United States standardscommunity is in an uproar over a perceived lack of representation in certainEuropean standards organizations and what to do about it.andP;  Both segments ofthe U.S.andP;  standards community--those who develop standards and those whoapply them through testing, certification, and quality assurance--areterribly upset, and even passionate, about the prospect of a European mark.andO;This seal of approval will indicate that a product conforms to harmonizedEuropean standards and will be required for certain regulated products, liketelecommunications terminal equipment, electrical products and consumerelectronics, to circulate in the Common Market.andM;Why is this important to American information technologists?andP;  Accompanyingthe regulation of some high-technology products is the broader push forsystems interoperability.andP;  This is no longer just a technical standardsmatter--now standardization itself is interconnected with international tradeand therefore with the political environment.andP;  With the push for Open SystemsInterconnection (OSI), ISDN, base communications like LANS, office documentarchitectures, interfaces for operating systems like UNIX and POSIX,applications portability, multimedia, desktop publishing, and mainlineprogramming languages like C and Ada, are all affected by work on technicalstandards.andM;Representatives of European standards organizations say they have on theirplates over 3000 work items that must be digested by January, 1993.andP;  And oncethose standards have been agreed upon, they will have to be applied viaDirectives and certification, testing, and quality assessment.andP;  SeveralDirectives, as mentioned in an earlier article, &quot;The European Community andInformation Technology&quot; (April, 1990), have already been adopted and willhave a tremendous impact on Europe's information industry.andP;  Some of thoserelating to information technology standards are: Mutual Recognition of TypeApproval for Telecommunications Terminal Equipment, Coordination Introductionof ISDN, and Standardization in the Field of Information Technology andTelecommunications.andP;  Figures 1 and 3, &quot;Milestones in CommunityStandardization Policy and &quot;The First Functional Standards Issued,&quot; revealthat much European standards activity so far relates directly to informationtechnology.andP;  In addition, there is talk of creating a special centralEuropean organization to perform tests and award certificates besides themark.andP;  This has American manufacturers, who have traditionally done thesetasks themselves, up in arms.andP;  Here are highlights of the issues that willcontinue to be covered as matters further unfold this summer.andM;The StandardsandM;Infrastructure In BriefandM;Without winding all the way through the labyrinthine structures of standardssystems here and abroad, suffice it to focus on three major development andapplication mechanisms--national, regional, international.andP;  Nationalstandards organizations, like the American National Standards Institute(ANSI), Deutsches Institut fur Normung eV (DIN), or the Japanese IndustrialStandards Committee (JISC), represent themselves at the InternationalOrganization for Standardization (ISO).andP;  The majority (70 percent) of thesemembers are governmental institutions or organizations.andP;  ANSI is a notableexception since it represents voluntary U.S.andP;  standards bodies, meaning thatstandards are developed by industry consensus with government participation.andO;ANSI interfaces with the U.S.andP;  government to inform legislative andregulatory agencies of its needs.andP;  And the head of the Department ofCommerce's National Institute of Technology and Standards (now NIST andformerly the National Bureau of standards, NBS) sits on ANSI's board.andP;  ButANSI does not have a formal agreement with the U.S.andP;  government, as DIN haswith the Federal Republic of Germany, to act as the official representativeof its government.andM;In the case of information technology, member bodies from each country sendrepresentatives to a joint committee of the International Organization forStandardization/International Electrotechnical Committee (ISO/IEC).andP;  ThisJoint Technical Group, formed in 1987 and known as JTC 1, handles informationprocessing systems standards.andP;  Its American technical advisory committee, orTAG, is accredited by ANSI.andM;The regional standards bodies for Europe are Comite Europeen de Normalisation(CEN), which was originated in 1957 with the inception of the Common Marketand formally organized in 1971, and Comite Europeen de NormalisationElectrotechnique (CENELEC).andP;  It is CEN and CENELEC (often referred to jointlyas CEN/CENELEC) that have before them the daunting task of plowing throughthose 3000 work items.andP;  Their officials assure the standards community atlarge whenever possible, CEN/CENELEC will adopt ISO/IEC standards.andP;  They alsosay that if they cannot complete the job by January 1993, interim standardswill be selected either from existing European standards, or possiblynon-European standards, but not national standards.andM;CEN is the European equivalent of ISO and has national standardsorganizations as members.andP;  Similarly, CENELEC is the European equivalent ofIEC.andP;  CEN's role in information technology (IT) is increasing as countrieswith nationalized telecommunications systems try to expand their influence inIT, and as telecommunications and IT merge, according to Carl F. Cargill, inhis book, Information Technology Standardization: Theory, Process, andOrganizations, (Digital Press, 1989).andP;  CEN has a subordinate body, CENCER,for certificates of conformance to CEN standards and certification of testhouses.andP;  Cargill comments on CEN's role in certification: &quot;This developmentmay have relatively large implications for the IT industry.andP;  If CEN succeedsin its effort to compile a regionally accepted list of test houses, it willbecome a major adjudicator in the IT industry in Europe, as well as the restof the world.andP;  It remains to be seen whether certification will be based oninternational marketing standards or on regulatory standards.&quot;andP;  (See Figure2, a chart depicting the connections beteen national, regional andinternational standards bodies.)andM;Although CEN/CENELEC are voluntary standards organizations, some peopleconsider them an extension of the EC because it pays 70 percent of theirsupport, by contract, for the development of technical standards for theEuropean Community.andP;  Some fear these standards will become de factoregulations.andP;  Another fear is lack of U.S.andP;  representation--it cannot be aregional member because it is not one of the nations of Europe.andP;  That meansEuropean nations have influence in both the international arena throughISO/IEC and the regional arena, whereas ANSI, and therefore informally theU.S.andP;  government, does not have influence in the European regional forum.andO;ANSI cannot comment on drafts of standards or standards-related Directives--there is no so-called transparency in the process.andP;  The growing role ofCEN/CENELEC is perceived as especially important to IT.andP;  As Cargill notes:&quot;As conformance to quality standards grows--and as the quality mark andsoftware ergonomics increase in importance--I believe that these twoorganizations will become significant participants in the IT standardsprograms in Europe and ISO.&quot;andM;Understanding this situation and seeing potential nontariff barriers totrade, some American-based multinational IT companies have tried to getaround the lack of regional representation in Europe by placing their peoplein strategic positions within national organizations.andP;  But that takesmoney--in some cases tens of millions of dollars have been spent to send theright people to orchestrate such strategies.andP;  Another way to balance theclout of European nations, but which was judged impractical, would be toalter the block voting system in ISO.andP;  The Europeans as a group would haveone vote instead of each nation having one individual vote.andP;  But that wouldhave meant a reduction in membership fees that ISO/IEC could not afford.andP;  Yetanother strategy has been for presidents of powerful companies to simply meetwith EC Commissioners and air their views directly.andP;  But where does thisleave the little guys?andM;Past Furor OverandM;Technical Barriers toandM;TradeandM;The last time there was such fear of nontariff trade barriers was in 1969,says ANSI past president Donald Peyton.andP;  A veteran with 22 years ofexperience in standards, he recalls that between rounds of General Agreementon Trade and Tariffs (GATT) negotiations, the Federal Registrar published anotice asking for information on barriers to trade.andP;  Until then, virtuallyall GATT negotiations were on tariffs.andP;  But in response to the notice,several standards organizations, including ANSI, met with a trade informationgovernment committee and introduced technical barriers to trade, meaningstandards and certification.andP;  As a result, a GATT committee was started;during the next 10 years it wrote the GATT standards code on how standardsand certifications would be run to prevent technical barriers to trade.andP;  Thatwas enacted in U.S.andP;  code as Section 4 of the U.S.andP;  Trade Act of 1979.andP;  &quot;Nowwith this European uprising--with the single European Act, this question israised again, 'Are were going to have transparency or are we not going tohave transparency?'&quot; says Peyton.andP;  He says that Department of Commerceofficials and some ANSI members think what the EC is doing now may be inviolation of GATT.andP;  &quot;We can't get a place at the table.andP;  We want to be a partof the action and they're saying no.andP;  We still can't get in and work on abasis of direct participation,&quot; he says.andP;  Whenever a standard is written,&quot;and I don't care who it is or what it is, the probability is that that willcreate some type of restriction or a change.andP;  You can be a victim of thatchange.andP;  You want to be involved in negotiations to try and prevent unduechange,&quot; says Peyton.andP;  Two groups are trying to attack this matter on twofronts, he says, the GATT standards code front, (at a time when GATT itselfis under review) and the EC front.andP;  Peyton is optimistic.andP;  &quot;I don't thinkwe're faring that badly,&quot; he says, &quot;It'll be alright in the end, but this isa time of concern.&quot;andM;U.S.andP;  Delegation Sent toandM;the ECandM;Last October, U.S.andP;  experts from the private sector and government met withEC and CEN/CENELEC officials to discuss U.S.andP;  concerns arising from ECinitiatives to harmonize European standards, testing, and certification.andO;There have been numerous meetings with private sector representatives alone,but this was the first joint meeting of both government and private sectorexperts.andP;  The U.S.andP;  delegation included representatives from ANSI, IEEE,NEMA, ASME, and laboratory testing organizations; and government officialsfrom NIST and the International Trade Administration.andP;  On the European sidethere were EC Commissioners from Directorate General III on the InternalMarket and XIII on Industrial Affairs and Information Technology, and fromCEN/CENELEC.andM;After the meeting, the Department of Commerce prepared a report summarizingthe status quo in four areas: Standards Development in the EuropeanCommunity; International Standardization and EC '92; Transparency of the ECand CEN/CENELEC; and Testing and Certification.andP;  According to the report,which can be obtained from the Single Internal Market Information Service *at the Department of Commerce, the Community has a two-fold strategy foreliminating trade barriers within the Common Market due to standards; one forregulated products and another for unregulated products.andP;  Food, drugs, autos,and tractors, for example, will be regulated by mandatory harmonizedtechnical specifications.andP;  There will be legislated standards, which, whenmet, will guarantee products free circulation within the Common Market.andO;There will also be safety, consumer protection, and environmentalrequirements that will appear in product-specific Directives for a wide rangeof products, including telecommunications terminal equipment.andP;  The Directiveswill mandate the criteria for declaring conformity, types of testing, andcertification.andP;  On the matter of voluntary standards and parallel CEN/CENELECactivities, the report used this phrasing: &quot;The EC Commission has asked[these] European standards entities to develop voluntary product standardsthat, in general, are presumed to meet mandatory requirements in the ECDirectives.&quot;andM;In the area of International Standardization and EC '92, the report said theU.S.andP;  delegation stated it was interested in using ISO/IEC's forum as one wayto participate in EC standards development, but noted that in some productareas international work is either not being done, is blocked or is not beingused.andP;  Both governments agreed to review their respective private {do theymean voluntary?} standard bodies' abilities to live up to the commitment touse international standards.andM;Regarding the EC's and CEN/CENELEC's transparency, meaning open proceduresthat would allow the U.S.andP;  to comment on proposed standards, the Commissionsaid it was willing to consult with U.S.andP;  interests over regulations, but itwill not share early drafts of Directives.andP;  The Official Journal remains theonly access to information on essential requirements.andP;  CEN/CENELEC said thatit had increased transparency for non-members by publishing draft standardsand monthly activity reports of working group activities which are availablethrough ANSI.andP;  Comments on these drafts can be made at any stage.andP;  ANSIintends to submit U.S.andP;  comments to TAGs before they are submitted toCEN/CENELEC.andP;  But ANSI reported that its proposal to ISO that members of ISOtechnical committees be allowed to participate in CEN/CENELEC standardsdevelopment was refused.andP;  CEN did agree to joint review of work plans,however.andP;  Both governments decided to review the effectiveness ofCEN/CENELEC's and ANSI's efforts at transparency.andM;Two Proposals forandM;Changing U.S.andM;Government's Role inandM;StandardsandM;The Department of Commerce is not only reviewing transparency, but isconsidering an overhaul of the U.S.andP;  standards system.andP;  Last fall, NIST'sStanley Warshaw commissioned Peyton to perform a study, &quot;Conduct andAdministration of U.S.andP;  Participation and Leadership in InternationalStandardization, Testing, and Certification in the Decade of the 1990s.&quot;andO;Published by NIST last March, it is being circulated for public review andcomment as this article goes to press.andP;  Peyton proposed that Congress createtwo national commissions.andP;  One wuld study the voluntary standards system inthe U.S.andP;  and its participation in international standardization.andP;  The otherwould study the application of standards and examine whether there should bea focal organization for U.S.andP;  testing, certification, accreditation, andquality assurance.andP;  But critics would say that such commissions might taketoo much time and that the EC is not going to wait.andP;  &quot;That's always acharge,&quot; says Peyton, &quot;Time is a problem.&quot;andP;  But he is recommending that thesecommissions endure for only one year.andP;  &quot;Wouldn't it be better to take a yearand study it and do it right rather than act in haste and enact somethingthat could do us irreparable harm?&quot;andM;While Peyton was conducting his study, Warshaw also announced hearings onapproaches to improving U.S.andP;  participation in internationalstandards-related activities (Federal Register, November 27, 1989, pp.andO;48795-6, Vol.andP;  54, No.andP;  226).andP;  Warshaw also circulated a proposal for aStandards Council of the United States of America (SCUSA) as a possible newmodel for &quot;government-private sector interactions.&quot;andP;  (See Sidebar on SCUSA'spurpose and scope.)andP;  Because of high industry response, the hearings wereheld over a three-day period instead of one day, as had been expected.andP;  Theybegan on April 3, 1990 and the comment period was extended until June 5.andO;Warshaw therefore declined to comment on just the hearings for thisarticle--written testimony at that time was a two-foot high stack of oftenimpassioned responses.andP;  An analysis will probably be prepared and submittedto the secretary of commerce and to Congress for its own hearings.andP;  At presstime, the Subcommittee on Science, Research, and Technology (a CongressionalCommittee within the Science, Space and Technology Committee) was planninghearings for mid-June that could lead to legislation.andM;Back to the NIST hearings, half a day was set aside for the IT industry,whose representatives were over-whelmingly conservative in their responsesand recommendations.andP;  L. John Rankine, Chairman of JTC 1, said that the U.S.andO;&quot;may well be developing a national hysteria&quot; regarding standards and EC '92.andO;Europe's efforts to dismantle technical barriers to trade do &quot;not mean thaton January 1, 1992 [sic], Europe will flip from one state to another likesome binary switch,&quot; he said.andP;  Later he said, &quot;It is not necessary to rush toopen offices in Brussels or to engineer U.S.andP;  government involvement with theregional nongovernmental European standards bodies such as CEN/CENELEC.&quot;andP;  Andhe asked, &quot;How would U.S.andP;  standards organizations feel if they had to dealwith European governments instead of their peers in Europe?andP;  How would theyfeel if the European standards bodies were to open offices in Washingtoninstead of working through them?&quot;andP;  Rankine favored strengthening ties toISO/IEC and ITU/CCITT and calling on the GATT standards code if problemsarise.andP;  Although he did not testify at the hearings, Peyton agrees thatISO/IEC should be the main forum but says that GATT's grievance procedure is&quot;weak&quot; and a &quot;stumbling block.&quot;andP;  &quot;The world--our side and their side andlet's not forget the Japanese--should settle these arguments in one place.andO;Not at CEN/CENELEC or GATT, but ISO and IEC.andP;  Those are world organizations,&quot;he says.andP;  &quot;The real core of action, the place where the big boys are going tomeet, where you have a reasonable mixture of public and private interest, isISO/IEC.andP;  Of course, in IT this is where the action is.&quot;andP;  So government andprivate industry should be doing everything possible to make ISO/IEC theirprimary forum for discussion, he reasons.andP;  &quot;Because in the end, if we don'thave international synergism, what have we got?andP;  We've got chaos.&quot;andM;The president of the Computer and Business Equipment ManufacturersAssociation (CBEMA), John Pickitt, was equally emphatic in his testimony andsupport of ISO/IEC and ANSI.andP;  Underscoring support for ANSI and its system ofTAGs in IT, he said, &quot;Our experience gives us rather a different view of thesituation facing our industry and the US currently and in the future thanthat implied by the hearings notice.andP;  In short, the government misperceivesthe current and future challenges, therefore proposes steps counterproductiveto our country's and industry's interests.&quot;andP;  He noted that the IT standardscommunity; which is global, has already recognized the value of going fromnational to international standards and &quot;has an acknowledged leadership rolein that field.&quot;andP;  Perceiving the hearings notice as critical of ANSI, Pickittsaid he disagrees with &quot;those who want to do away with ANSI,&quot; a creation ofthe voluntary standards system.andP;  Instead, government should support thatsystem by &quot;continuing to enhance the current government-consumer-producerparticipation via ANSI.&quot;andP;  He gave examples of how effective JTC 1 has been inISO/IEC meetings so that the U.S.andP;  position prevailed.andP;  &quot;We should not changeour process just because other nations organize their systems in a differentway,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;The EC, for example, aims to conquer a range of diversitiesto create an internal market free of barriers--a short-term challenge we donot have.andP;  The top-down approach the EC has chosen is antithetical to ours.&quot;andM;Although ANSI did not send an official to testify, Chairman of the BoardJames N.andP;  Pearse said afterwards that his organization envisions thegovernment playing an active and supportive role within the existingvoluntary system &quot;through an alliance with the private sector.&quot;andP;  This wouldenable the U.S.andP;  to speak with one voice, he said.andP;  However, this does notmean that the government should create new institutions to regulate thesystem, thereby undermining the existing private sector structure.andP;  &quot;SCUSAaims to duplicate the work currently being done by the Institute and istantamount to government regulation of the U.S.andP;  standards, testing, andcertification system.&quot;andM;According to Peyton's survey respondents, and as he wrote in his report,&quot;while standards development is of critical importance, it pales bycomparison with the multitude of problems and uncertainties facing U.S.andO;product manufacturers and testing, certifying and accrediting bodies ininternational markets.&quot;andP;  He says, &quot;The big battle is going to come with thelab and testing community.andP;  This is big business in its total.&quot;andP;  Most of thelabs themselves are not big, with the exception of Underwriters Laboratories,and since their clients are from all walks of industry, the field isdiversified and fragmented.andP;  But certification and testing are ready to hitthe IT community because many standards profiles, like message handling, arebeing formulated now by consortia, such as the Corporation for Open Systems(COS), the European Workshop for Open Systems (EWOS), and MAP/TOP.andP;  Theseconsortia are relatively new, having been formed in the last five years.andO;According to Cargill, they are like political action committees, or PACs, inthat they lobby or try to influence the original standards bodies for thebenefit of special interest groups, or in the computer industry, users.andP;  Itis likely that users will require evidence of conformity.andM;Certification, Testing,andM;Quality Assurance, andandM;the European MarkandM;Certification, testing and quality assurance and the European mark werediscussed at the October meeting and a sumary of findings appears in thesecond part of the Department of Commerce report.andP;  These topics were alsohotly debated at ANSI's 1990 Public Conference last spring on success in theglobal market.andP;  The debate followed a lively speech by Edna Jacques, IBM'sProgram Director of Standards and that company's representative on severalANSI and ISO technical committees.andP;  Because IBM is so influential, has thelargest presence in Europe of any computer vendor, and in this caserepresents the classic view of manufacturers, Jacques' speech is summarizedbelow.andP;  A wrap-up of reactions to her speech follows.andM;Jacques began by stating that one way for manufacturers to be successful in aglobal market is to correctly use certification, conformance assessment andquality.andP;  But she warned that certification and testing are being packagedand marketed in a new way and in some cases, being misrepresented.andP;  Shewarned that &quot;criteria are being formulated in a way that determines access toU.S.andP;  products at home and abroad.andP;  The use of voluntary quality assuranceand standards are now required as a condition for doing business.&quot;andO;Furthermore, she said industry should not allow the misapplication of qualityassessment to become a &quot;vehicle&quot; for drawing industry into a &quot;regulatoryenvironment.&quot;andP;  Looking for a moment at matters from the user's point of view,she commented, &quot;Any consumer knows that just because a product passes a testor conforms to a standard does not mean that that product will satisfy his orher needs.&quot;andM;TestingandM;Manufacturers understand that testing their products is necessary andintegral to doing business, said Jacques.andP;  In the U.S.andP;  they usually have twooptions.andP;  &quot;The most sophisticated form of testing is to build your test intothe design criteria,&quot; she said, whereas end-point testing, performed by themanufacturer itself or a third party test house, is done when a product iscomplete.andP;  Manufacturers should have the option to use their own testingprocess or to send the work out--an important business decision.andP;  But in theU.S., many test houses will not guarantee that a product will do what thecustomer wants even though the product may have passed a test.andP;  Themanufacturer is held accountable and legally responsible, so if a productfails to satisfy a consumer, he or she brings the complaint to themanufacturer.andP;  The manufacturer's test results should stand on equal footingwith the test results of third party businesses.andP;  Although she believes thattesting should be based on international criteria and should haveinternational acceptance, Jacques cautioned that &quot;Just because somethingpassed a test does not mean it's an automatic candidate for certification.andO;Testing does not beget certification.&quot;andM;CertificationandM;The ANSI definition of certification links it with written assurance, saysJacques, and that in turn means a guarantee.andP;  Traditionally, certification inthe areas of safety and in homolagation--physical harm to the net worth--hasinvolved scientific methods whereby problems can be defined and resultsmeasured, she explained.andP;  &quot;I can tell you how much voltage is going to killsomebody given the range of their weight.andP;  You can tell somebody how muchpoison or how much lead is going to kill them,&quot; said Jacques, but&quot;certification is going into areas that are subject to people'sinterpretation and personal judgment.&quot;andP;  Relating certification to thecomputer industry, she asked, &quot;Can anyone here guarantee the end operabilityof software?andP;  Can anybody guarantee [its] quality?andP;  In fact, most peoplecan't even agree on what it is.andP;  What is a quality terminal?andP;  Is it [basedon] performance, pricing, user friendliness?andP;  Is it its weight, is it thescreen image?andP;  One man's risk is another man's poison, in quality.&quot;andM;Outlining her recommendation of an industry position on certification,Jacques concluded, &quot;If you cannot guarantee, you should not certify.&quot;andO;Arguing that manufacturers must have the option to self-declare, shecontrasted American certification with the EC mark.andP;  She said, &quot;In the UnitedStates, when you put a mark or a seal on somebody's product you are in thecertification's product you are in the certification business.andP;  And thepublic expects the product to perform a certain way.andP;  In many Europeancountries test houses are absolved from litigation, so they will put the markon your product and then walk away from it and say to the manufacturer, 'It'sall yours now.andP;  It's your problem.'&quot;andM;Manufacturers should not only be able to declare, or self-certify, becausethey are legally accountable, she said, but also because elaborate means ofcertification can compromise the security of trade secrets.andP;  &quot;When you startpassing data to different bodies, you do increase the likelihood ofmishandling proprietary information.andP;  And in a competitive environment thatis very critical,&quot; she said.andM;QualityandM;Determining quality is a matter of interpretation and must be kept separatefrom product certification, said Jacques.andP;  &quot;Ultimately, quality can only befinally determined in the marketplace.andP;  You cannot mandate top quality, youcannot edict quality, and you cannot regulate it.&quot;andP;  Yet despite the EC'sassurances to non-European business communities that whenever possibleCEN/CENELEC will adopt ISO/IEC standards, Jacques cited examples where eitherthat did not happen or the original intent of ISO authors was not followed.andO;An author herself, of the ISO 9000 series covering certification of qualitymanagement and quality assurance systems, she explained that these documentswere deliberately written for voluntary use in two-party contractualsituations.andP;  &quot;As a U.S.andP;  expert in 1985 when I worked on the development of9001, -2, and -3, the documents were full of the words, 'Certifier,third-party and regulatory.'andP;  All of those words have been removed.andP;  On thefirst page you will read, 'two party contractual.'andP;  Throughout thosestandards they will speak to the supplier and the purchaser.andP;  They should notbe misused.andP;  They are voluntary.andP;  They should not be a condition for doingbusiness.&quot;andM;The ISO 9000 series was published in December, 1989, simultaneously with thefruits of another standards body, ISO CASCO, the Committee on ConformityAssessment.andP;  According to Jacques, i  drafting the document &quot;Certificatio  ofa Supplier Quality System,&quot; U.S.andP;  experts including Baron Whitaker of theUnderwriters Laboratories, Inc. (one of the most powerful U.S.andP;  test houses);Joh  Donaldson of NIST; Canadian representatives; and Jacques herself,&quot;fought very hard to maintain the separation of quality assurance assessmentand product certification.&quot;andP;  They won.andP;  This document was published beforeCEN/CENELEC's EN 45-0-112, which addresses certification of quality systems.andO;&quot;What is very key here,&quot; Jacques emphasized, &quot;is the international communityrejected the concept of certification of quality systems and said that itshould be separate from product certification.&quot;andM;Jacques insisted that governments should not use quality assessment as a wayto interfere with competitive market forces based particularly onprice/performance criteria.andP;  Looking at the dawn of the automotive industry,she said, &quot;Most people will agree that a Rolls Royce is of higher qualitythan a Ford.andP;  But it's fortunate that our government did not decide that allcars had to have the quality level of a Rolls Royce.andP;  Because if thegovernment had made that decision, a lot of us wouldn't own cars.andP;  So I wantto thank the government for staying out of business, and I want to thankHenry Ford, because he understood the marketplace.andP;  He understood the qualitylevel that consumers would accept.andP;  He understood what the majority of peoplecould afford to pay.&quot;andP;  In addition, Jacques noted that a product can receiveadverse publicity and the marketplace will still love and accept it.andP;  &quot;Mindyou, I am not talking about safety.andP;  It can be stated that a product isdirty, oily, noisy or even ugly, but if the consumers love it, nothing shortof sabotage can kill the success of that product in the marketplace.andP;  Forexample, the ugly Cabbage Patch doll.&quot;andM;Addressing the affect of quality conformance testing and certification oninnovation and creativity, which spawn new businesses and create jobs, sheasked, &quot;How do you ask Edwin Land, who invented the Poloroid camera, aboutthe quality of his camera, especially when he's the only game in town, heholds the patent rights, and the demand far exceeds the supply?andP;  Or how doyou ask Chester Carlson of the Xerox process what specs he conforms to?andP;  Andwill any inventor share his design criteria?andP;  That's like giving away thefamily jewels.andP;  And outside of safety, what do you certify?&quot;andP;  Analogously,one wonders how you ask the developer of the next Lotus 1-2-3 whatspecifications it conforms to?andM;In conclusion, Jacques stated that in a free enterprise system, innovationand creativity flow, competition is a way of life, and consumers have a rightto have their requirements met if not exceeded.andP;  &quot;But when we talk about themarketplace and when we talk about being successful,&quot; she warned &quot;and I dowant the U.S.andP;  to expand its markets and I want the U.S.andP;  to be verysuccessful in a global market, be ever mindful that when you talk aboutmarketing and increasing share, a loss is a loss, whether it is to technologyor bureaucracy.&quot;andM;In the discussion that followed Jacques' speech, cultural differe ces andantithetical business philosophies and practices emerged.andP;  Questions werealso raised about exactly who is Europe is pushing changes in testing,certification and quality assessment procedures.andP;  Is it business, testhouses, governments?andM;Klaus Petrick of the German Association for Certification and Quality Systems(DQS) responded first to Jacques' remarks on quality system certification.andO;&quot;This is only one element of our procedure,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;If you have amanufacturer more confident in his quality capability, then you might beinterested to assess his quality system and that can be made contractuallyand in confidence.&quot;andP;  Replying to Jacques' reference to the quality of RollsRoyces and Fords, he said, &quot;This is a question of grade.andP;  You have to selecta grade point and then you have to specify the requirement for quality, inrelation to those requirements for quality and you can have an excellentquality for low grade products.&quot;andM;Jacques responded to Petrick.andP;  &quot;Just because you have a quality systemdoesn't mean tht you're going to invest in a quality product,&quot; she said.andP;  &quot;Idoubt very seriously [that] when Steve Jobs was working on his first computerhis main focus was on the quality manual.c  Moreover it is setting qualitygrades that concerns her, she said, because that involves interpretation andjudgement.andP;  &quot;What you're doing is filtering the marketplace, you'reinterfering with the buyer's decision.andP;  If I want to buy a cheap product andthrow it away, that should be my right in a free enterprise system.&quot;andM;Robert Toth, of the consulting firm RB Toth Associates, asked the panelwhether manufacturers or third party test houses and certifiers were moreinfluential in Europe.andP;  Many manufacturers, or OEMs, with similar views toJacques perceive that both in Europe and to a certain extent in the U.S., thethird party service orientation seems to be leading the push in policy andthey think this is self-serving, he noted.andP;  &quot;Is the European thrust based ona pull from manufacturers or is it a push from third party service agencies?&quot;andO;he wondered.andM;Evangelos Vardakas, Secretary General of CEN, replied that in Europe, allsystems are based on agreements between third parties: between test housesand test houses; certifiers and certifiers; and so on.andP;  This tradition opensthe possibility of users of these kinds of services, that is, industry, torepresent themselves.andP;  &quot;If you see the system from this point [of view] it isevident that it is industry which would like to be more involved incontrolling what services are offered to the industry as user ...andP;  [rather]than being organized by the testing houses or certifiers.&quot;andP;  He believes,therefore, that the system of representation on the level of the Council ofthe EC proves that it is an industry push.andM;But Petrick more directly expressed the EC philosophy that test results andcertificates recognized by only one country are barriers to trade and saidthat the push to remove them comes from governments.andP;  He also pointed out thediversity of influence still existing among individual European nations.andO;Quality system assessment, in particular, is perceived by different countriesin different ways, he said.andP;  &quot;In Germany we had a strong position, in thebeginning, against formalization of these questions of assessing qualitysystems.&quot;andP;  Industry has moved to another position, he said.andP;  &quot;They seeinternally they still have deficiencies and if they are pushed a little bitby third parties, by governments, or by their internal quality people, thenthey could improve their procedures.andP;  So company management only, orsometimes only, reacts to external forces and this results in internalimprovement.andP;  We have parallel actions--some push and some pull.andP;  .  .butthis depends very much on the country.&quot;andM;Earlier in the conference, Gordon Gaddes, president of CENELEC and presidentof the British Electro-technical and Allied Manufacturers Association (BEAMA)described another kind of synergism, not between business and test houses,but between certifiers and standardizers.andP;  &quot;Certification is not the directtask of the standardizers,&quot; he said, &quot;but the use of standards in allexisting and future certification initiatives implies a close collaborationand feed-back between certification circles a d standardization bodies.andP;  Allmutual acceptance requires measures for the establishment of basic confidenceand mutual understanding amongst those involved in certification in Europe.andO;CEN and CENELEC and their members are the ideal and experienced fora inEurope to deliver a real contribution to the process involved.&quot;andM;Back to the panel discussion, G. Thomas Castino of Underwriters Laboratories,said that his organization did not apply ISO 9000 until it &quot;saw theglobalization effort,&quot; and acknowledged that perhaps the documents were notbeing adopted as the developers had originally intended.andP;  Yet they are slowlybut surely becoming the world norm and an interesting benefit results, hesaid.andP;  &quot;It is a program based on a confidence level.andP;  It's based on a qualitysystem approach that would allow us to forego some of the repetitiveinspection approach, in other words, [we could forego] beating defects todeath by more and more inspections.&quot;andP;  Instead, assessing the quality systemcan reduce the amount of work and improve the overall rejection rate, Castinosaid.andP;  &quot;Remember, quality is the reduction of defects.andP;  If you're on anongoing quality system you're attempting to reduce defects to zero on acontinuing basis.andP;  Whether you get there in your lifetime or not, youcontinue to work at it.&quot;andP;  He believes that a combination of the zero defectapproach and the confidence philosophy behind ISO 9000 will interest Americanindustry.andM;At a later point in the discussion, Jacques said that some documents fromEurope reveal &quot;a basic misunderstanding of the fact that there is nothing,nobody, a manufacturer values more than the customer, because if you can'tsatisfy the customer you won't stay in business.&quot;andP;  Global documents have morethan once inferred that manufacturers are dishonest and not to be trusted,she said.andP;  Yet there are many ways to deal with dishonesty--the betterbusiness bureaus, publicity, small claims court, and civil and criminalcourts.andP;  &quot;In this country we assume that you are innocent until provenguilty.andP;  So I'm always concerned when someone says, I've got to check up onyou because I cannot trust you.andP;  And yet my customers trust me.andP;  They stillbuy from me.&quot;andP;  The audience applauded.andM;Again philosophical differences are evident.andP;  At a quality and riskmanagement conference a month later, for example, James Hemsley of Brameur,Ltd., London, presented his views o software quality assessment with theadvent of EC '92.andP;  A manager of two ESPRIT projects and a participant inISO/IEC and British standards working groups, Hemsley remarked: &quot;The spectreof a Software Fortress emerging in Europe in '1992' is a valid concern onlyfor software suppliers which are unethical (e.g., software 'pirates') or lowquality producers (safety-critical software).&quot;andP;  Ethical non-Europeansuppliers of high-quality software should not experience problems arisingfrom EC '92 other than increased competition across Europe fromEuropean-based suppliers who will no longer face internal barriers, Hemsleysaid.andP;  He expects co-operation with high quality U.S.andP;  software producers tobe actively sought, both for &quot;inward investment and R andamp; D collaboration.&quot;andP;  Heconcluded, therefore, that EC '92 &quot;should be seen as an opportunity for highquality U.S.andP;  software producers.&quot;andM;As the ANSI discussion wound down, Bernard Falk, the moderator and Presidentof the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) called foraction: &quot;The business community has been larging.andP;  I don't think mostbusiness people realize what's at stake here.andP;  They're not concerned,frankly.andP;  Deals are going to be made without input from the businesscommunity as to whether they are good business deals.andP;  They may be goodstandards deals, they may be good testing deals, they may be good documentdeals.andP;  But when you talk about trade, what's the best economic deal?andP;  Wehave to push our people and get them involved in the act.&quot;andM;Finally, Steven Spivak of the University of Maryland suggested a hypotheticalsituation in which, despite the &quot;very eloquent and elegant&quot; argumentspresented by Jacques and others, the Europeans were to complete testing andcertification and quality assessment procedures as the chose.andP;  &quot;What shouldeither ANSI or the IBM-type multinational companies do in two to four yearsfrom now, when faced with then hypothetical conclusion that [we could not]dissuade the Europeans with our arguments to change their thinking?,&quot; heasked.andM;Jacques replied that unfortunately &quot;we're kind of slow [to react] in thiscountry,&quot; and then &quot;all of a sudden we kill the fly with a sledge hammer,&quot; ashappened with VCRs when American industry constantly complained about dumpingand then suddenly the President called for a 100 percent tariff on VCRs.andO;Jacques then depicted how inaction could snowball: &quot;When a small plant with500 people suddenly goes out of business and their Congressman asks why andis told our quality system was lousy and we couldn't ship our product, thatCongressman will understand that he's lost 500 votes and 500 people areunemployed,&quot; she said.andP;  In such a scenario, attention &quot;will get very quicklyup to trade issues.andM;And so, we have come full circle to the role of government in standards,certification, testing, and quality assessment and the possibility ofCongressional action.andP;  Multinationals and the IT industry are already global,but as Peyton says, &quot;the people who really need help don't have [the same]advantages.&quot;andP;  There are smaller multinationals that are not from globalindustries yet and the only other two industries that are really global aretelecommunications and petroleum.andP;  &quot;The big guys can buy their wayin--anybody who wants in can buy in.andP;  You go to Europe, set up something andthen you become a part of the European Community.&quot;andP;  But rules and Directivescan still &quot;be very dangerous for smaller businesses,&quot; he says, &quot;that's whyI'm in favor of some government activity here.andP;  If I went to the IT industryand said I wanted a government commission, I might not get out alive.andP;  Butthe industries that are beginning to emerge on the international scene .andP;  . andO;.  need the government to make sure that they're not being disadvantaged.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
