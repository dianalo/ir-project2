The Kohlberg Kravis announcement came four days after managersof the food and tobacco products company said they were consideringtaking the manufacturer private for nearly $17 billion.   ``Management has decided that the company should be sold. Ouroffer is a better one,'' Henry Kravis, a partner in the NewYork-based leveraged buyout specialist firm, said in a statement.   The Kohlberg Kravis offer was for $90 a share in cash andsecurities, compared with the management buyout proposal of $75 ashare in cash.   There was no immediate comment from RJR Nabisco.   However, investors reacted enthusiastically to news of theKohlberg Kravis bid. RJR Nabisco stock shot up $10.37{ a share to$87.12{ in early New York Stock Exchange trading today.   Kohlberg Kravis had been expected to enter the whirlwind of bidsfor food companies that began Oct. 4 with a $5.23 billion bid forPillsbury Co. by Grand Metropolitan PLC, a British company.   Kravis said his company had raised an equity pool of $5.6billion for leveraged buyouts. In a leveraged buyout, investorsborrow heavily to purchase a company and then pay off the debt withthe target company's cash flow or the sale of its assets.   Securities analysts said last week the plan by RJR Nabiscomanagement was a pre-emptive strike to protect the company thatmanufactures many well-known brand names, including Winston andCamel cigarettes and Oreo cookies, from an unwanted suitor.   RJR Nabisco President F. Ross Johnson and other executives madetheir announcement after Philip Morris Cos. Inc. offered more than$11 billion for Kraft Inc., the processed foods manufacturer.   Kohlberg Kravis had been thought to be considering a bid forKraft, which late Sunday rejected the Philip Morris bid andannounced a $13.59 billion recapitalization plan.   Kohlberg Kravis carried out the largest leveraged buyout in U.S.history in 1986 when it took the food and consumer productsconglomerate Beatrice Cos. private for $6.1 billion.   The investment firm is also leading a group that is attemptingto acquire the publishing giant Macmillan Inc. for $2.5 billion.British publisher Robert Maxwell, who also seeks to buy Macmillan,is fighting that bid in a Delaware court.   Kohlberg Kravis recently withdrew a $5.03 billion bid for thesupermarket operator Kroger Co. after Kroger rejected the offer andsaid it would proceed with a financial restructuring.   In its statement today, Kohlberg Kravis said its offer for RJRNabisco was conditioned upon approval of RJR Nabisco's board. Theinvestment firm said it would begin its tender offer later thisweek, but did not specify exactly when it would begin.</TEXT></DOC>
