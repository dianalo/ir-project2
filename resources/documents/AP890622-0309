Thursday said it haspermanently stopped using animals in its product safety tests,becoming the first major cosmetics maker to do so.   Animal rights activists praised Avon and said they hoped Avon'sdecision would encourage other companies to completely halt animaltesting.   The beauty products company said it will rely on alternativenon-animal methods, harmless tests on people and an extensivecomputerized data base containing information on the safety ofingredients that previously have been examined.   James E. Preston, Avon's chairman and chief executive officer,said the company has been working since the early 1980s to reducethe number of animals used in evaluating its beauty products and tofind other means.   ``This marks the successful conclusion of that program,'' Prestonsaid. He had said months ago that the company intended to make thetemporary ban permanent.   Susan Rich, coordinator of a campaign to abolish animal testingorganized by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, welcomedAvon's decision.   ``It's wonderful news. It's historic news,'' said Rich. ``Avonmade a compassionate and progressive decision. We hope it encouragesother companies to follow suit.''   PETA, which had made Avon the focus of an international campaign,said that it now will target Revlon Inc., Gillette Co. and CosmairInc.   Before deciding to permanently stop animal testing, a practiceAvon had temporarily discontinued earlier this year, Avon had itsnew procedures reviewed by private scientists specializing in eyecare, skin care and poisons.   The Food and Drug Administration was told of Avon's newprocedures. The federal agency is responsible for monitoring thesafety of cosmetics but its approval is not required for testingprocedures.   No U.S. law specifically requires cosmetics to be tested onanimals. FDA officials have said in the past that as a matter ofpracticality companies wouldn't use tests that governmentauthorities considered inadequate.   Preston said in a news release that until a broader range ofnon-animal tests are available, some suppliers to the cosmeticsindustry might have to continue to do some animal testing asformulas containing new raw ingredients are developed.   Last year, Preston said, Avon approved 95 percent of its formulasthrough analysis using its data base, which is the foundation of itsnew evaluation procedures.   Numerous companies in the cosmetics, chemical and pharmaceuticalindustries for years have been exploring ways that don't involveanimals to ensure that new products work as intended and thatconsumers aren't harmed by them.   Avon is among many companies that donate money to fund researchinto possible replacements for traditional animal tests. Avon saidThursday that the company will continue to fund research.   Researchers around the country have been experimenting with cellcultures, bacteria, living tissue in test tubes and computersimulations, plus other potential testing methods.   In February, Avon announced it was no longer using the Draize eyeirritation test, which has been widely used by industries for morethan 50 years. The company replaced the Draize test, which usesrabbits, with a test-tube evaluation process developed by theNational Testing Corp. of Palm Springs, Calif.   Avon, one of the largest manufacturers and marketers of cosmeticsin the world, disbanded its own animal-testing operation last summerand has said it hasn't asked independent laboratories to conducttests on animals since mid-March of this year.   Other beauty products companies also have announced temporarysuspensions or reductions in the use of animal tests.</TEXT></DOC>
