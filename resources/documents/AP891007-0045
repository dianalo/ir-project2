Government spokesman Mauricio Sandoval called the embassytakeover ``an affront to the government and people of Costa Rica... a violent action that makes no sense.'' He alleged the group'sactivists had ``direct links'' to leftist guerrillas fightingSalvadoran governments for 10 years.   Some of the 20 members of the Federation of Committees ofMothers and Relatives of Political Prisoners who took part in theincident may be charged, he said without elaboration.   The activists, mostly mothers and other female relatives ofpeople jailed or killed by right-wing death squads over the pastdecade, released their hostages Friday. Hostages and activists weretaken away in six International Red Cross vehicles.   Police would not let reporters talk to evacuees. None of thehostages _ one Costa Rican diplomat and 11 Salvadorans employed inthe embassy _ appeared harmed.   Sandoval said the hostages were taken to Red Cross headquartersin San Salvador for medical checks before being sent home and theactivists returned to their group's headquarters.   The government spokesman said the activists apparently lefttheir weapons ``inside the offices or hidden,'' because theyboarded the Red Cross vehicles unarmed. The activists had insistedthey were not armed, but Costa Rican diplomats said they carriedweapons.   The activists arrived in small groups early Thursday, pretendingto apply for visas, then seized the embassy and took 16 hostages.They later allowed Ambassador Jesus Fernandez, who had hearttrouble, and some employees to leave. A spokeswoman for theactivists, who did not give her name, told reporters earlier thehostage-taking was to protest alleged human rights violations byPresident Alfredo Cristiani's rightist government, which took powerJune 1. It also was to bring pressure for ``concrete measures'' toend the war.   For eight years, the federation has protested the kidnappingsand killings of people suspected of leftist sympathies by rightistdeath squads. More than 70,000 people have died in the decade-oldwar, most of them civilians.</TEXT></DOC>
