(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A bank is offering low-interest loans forthe start-up or expansion of day-care centers to make child caremore widely available to working parents.   ``The biggest `why?' is that we just really feel like it is theright thing to do, because there is, as we perceived it, acontinuing need for quality day-care facilities in the state,'' saidH. Dabney Smith, a vice president of NCNB South Carolina, a regionalbank.   The bank will lend money to operators of licensed child-careprograms at the bank's own cost of funds. On Monday, that would havemeant 8.53 percent for a 15-year loan, or nearly 3 percentage pointsbelow the prime rate.   Some of the loans will be guaranteed by the U.S. Small BusinessAdministration.   ``It's a fairly new concept,'' Smith said. ``There have beenother things in other states with various governmental agenciesbeing involved, but this is the first thing we know of that a bankhas actually gone out and tried to do something to be ofassistance.''   The program is limited to South Carolina for now, but Smith saidthat if it is successful, North Carolina-based NCNB might expand itto some of the other six states in which it operates.   A spokesman for the American Bankers Association said he hadn'theard of any similar loan programs.   Sally Hardy of Yes Inc., a Columbia child-care resource andreferral agency, said the program was important symbolically andfinancially.   ``I know of child-care providers who quite frankly would expandwith this fund, who are waiting to take advantage of something likethis,'' she said. ``The fact that a major bank would come out andmake a commitment like this is certainly symbolic of the communityneed.''   The program also won praise from the office of Gov. CarrollCampbell, who backed a compromise child-care measure passed earlierthis month to give tax breaks to businesses that offer child-careprograms to their employees.   ``I think it very clearly dovetails with the legislativeinitiatives of this year, which clearly focus on private sectorinvolvement in expanding day-care opportunities,'' said TuckerEskew, Campbell's spokesman.</TEXT></DOC>
