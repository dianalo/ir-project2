The price for the November contract for West Texas Intermediateoil changed course several times during Tuesday's session, tradingas high as $13.74 and as low as $13.30 a barrel. The contract forthe benchmark U.S. crude settled at $13.55, down 5 cents fromMonday's close.   Like Monday's session _ when November West Texas Intermediateclimbed 66 cents _ Tuesday's trading was dominated by rumors andspeculation about production by the 13-members Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries, analysts said.   Prices rose Monday as Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oilexporter, reaffirmed it would stick to its production quota ifother members of OPEC did.   On Tuesday, prices again moved higher, said Richard Redoglia, atrader with Merrill Lynch Energy Futures. But the market turnedlower when Saudi King Fahd failed to discuss OPEC member'sinability to stay within their output quotas during an address,Redoglia said.   Rumors that the United Arab Emirates was willing to cut itsproduction then hit the market, and prices advanced again beforefinally slipping lower at the end of the day, he said.   Redoglia, who described trading as volatile, attributedTuesday's brief rallies to short covering, in which investors buycontracts to offset those they sold earlier.   He said the market's underlying fundamentals remained negative.   ``The bearishness about OPEC overproduction is still there,'' hesaid, predicting, ``the market is going to continue trading likethis'' until OPEC can resolve its differences.   In other trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, theNovember contract for wholesale unleaded gasoline fell 0.62 cent tosettle at 40.79 cents a gallon, while home heating oil rose 0.12cent to 39.08 cents a gallon.</TEXT></DOC>
