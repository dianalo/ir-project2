The letter claiming responsibility for the violence also decriedthe legal system's handling of crimes by blacks against whites,particularly mentioning last year's slaying of Julie Love inAtlanta, a case never touched by the two men killed in themid-December bombings.   The letter, from a group calling itself Americans for aCompetent Federal Judicial System, said 11th U.S. Circuit Court ofAppeals Judge Robert S. Vance and Savannah attorney Robert Robinsonwere ``assassinated ... in reprisal for the atrocities inflictedupon Julie Love.''   The letter, which was sent to WAGA-TV in Atlanta and disclosedThursday, said the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals must be shownthat ``protecting the innocent warrants a higher court prioritythan granting the blacks' demand for white teachers for theirchildren.''   The letter did not refer to specific cases.   However, Vance was on the 11th Circuit panel that directedsuburban Atlanta's DeKalb County school system this year totransfer about 120 veteran teachers from majority white schools topredominantly black ones in a long-running desegregation case there.   A school desegregation case in Savannah also was before the 11thCircuit this year. Vance did not sit on the panel that heard theSavannah case, but Robinson had represented the NAACP in that suit.   The letter threatened that ``two more prominent members of theNAACP shall be assassinated, using more sophisticated means'' aspart of the reprisal for Ms. Love's death.   A federal judge, an attorney and an NAACP officer will bekilled, the letter added, ```anytime a black man rapes a whitewoman in Alabama, Florida or Georgia in the future.'' TheAtlanta-based 11th Circuit hears federal appeals from those threestates.   Ms. Love, a white preschool fitness teacher, disappeared July11, 1988, and her body was found last August. The search for herwas highly publicized in the area, with ``Have You Seen JulieLove'' posters ubiquitous.   Following the discovery of her body this year, two black menwere arrested, one of whom has pleaded guilty to murder, rape,kidnapping and armed robbery. The other man is awaiting trial formurder.   The DeKalb County school case dates back to 1969, when thesystem was first placed under a federal court order to desegregate.The 11th Circuit last year overturned a district judge's rulingthat by 1988 DeKalb County had done its best to integrate the73,000-student system.   The appeals court's subsequent ruling that DeKalb must takefurther steps toward integration recently went before the SupremeCourt, where the justices this month refused to intervene.   In Savannah, a lengthy school desegregation case was decided inOctober when the 11th Circuit ruled that a ``magnet school'' planoffered by the school system was appropriate for integration. TheNational Association for the Advancement of Colored People, whichhad argued that the plan still left many black students insegregated schools, has not yet said whether it will appeal.</TEXT></DOC>
