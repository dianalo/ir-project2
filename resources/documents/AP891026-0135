A spokesman for the Israeli Manufacturers' Association saidThursday the group has asked police to investigate the Al GhazelMacaroni Co. in the occupied West Bank city of Bethlehem.   ``We asked police to investigate why they are allowed todistribute the flag in this way. It should be considered againstthe law,'' said Danny Leish, the spokesman for the group, Israel'slargest industrial association.   The Palestinian flag is illegal in Israel and the occupiedterritories. Israel considers it the flag of the PalestineLiberation Organization, which the government defines as aterrorist organization.   The spaghetti dispute is the latest in a long string of battlesover the flag during the 22-month-old Palestinian uprising. It alsoreflects Israeli anger over at economic slump, blamed partly on therevolt, which has sent unemployment to a record 9.5 percent.   Wadi Abu Eta, the owner of Al Ghazel, could not be reached forcomment. His factory is on the edge of Beit Sahour, a village thatthe army has declared a closed area since it has boycotted Israelitaxes during the uprising. Telephone lines to the area also are cut.   Ruth Shlesinger, a spokeswoman for national police in Jerusalem,declined comment on the complaint, filed two weeks ago.   Leish denied the complaint was aimed at harming an Arabcompetitor, but acknowledged Israeli food manufacturers were amongthe hardest hit by Israel's recession.   Israeli food companies have lost $100 million in the last 22months and had to cut about 1,000 jobs, Leish said.   He blamed much of the damage on a boycott of Israeli products bythe 1.7 million Arabs of the West Bank and Gaza Strip as part ofthe uprising against occupation.   The problem is compounded, Leish said, by Arab competitors whomarket products within Israel in package that have Hebrew but notArabic letters.   He noted Al Ghazel's spaghetti has only Hebrew letters on itspackage with red, white, green and black strips and added themanufacturers' group has asked the army to insist Arab products beclearly identified.   Palestinian manufacturers also have complained that Israeliproducts sold in the occupied lands often are not tagged with theirplace of origin.   Packaging and lettering are only some of the symbols that arefought over in the Palestinian uprising. Soldiers and policeregularly force Arab youths to pull down Palestinian flags andsometimes order them to remove shirts in the flag's colors.   Earlier this week, the Hadashot daily reported, an Israelihospital refused to register a Bedouin Arab baby girl given thepopular uprising name ``Tahrir,'' Arabic for ``liberation.''   Israeli reports on Al Ghazal spaghetti noted the package alsobears a Kosher stamp showing it conforms with Jewish dietary laws.</TEXT></DOC>
