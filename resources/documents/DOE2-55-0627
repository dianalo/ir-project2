The proceedings on the main issue had to decidewhether the Bavarian Ministry of Regional Development and EnvironmentalAffairs as the competent supervising authority is obliged to order astop of construction work on the grounds that there is no valid constructionpermit for the establishment of the receiving station after the BayVGH(Bavarian Court of Administration) with its decision of April 2, 1987had set aside the relevant permit.
