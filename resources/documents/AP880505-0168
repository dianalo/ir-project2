Officials at the Oakdale, La., and Atlanta, Ga., federal prisonsalso had no plans for dealing with institution-wide disturbances,said the report, dated Feb. 1 but not made available untilWednesday.   The rioting, which lasted for eight days at Oakdale and 11 daysat Atlanta, included the taking of prison guards as hostages andresulted in one death of a detainee and millions of dollars indamage to the institutions. It was triggered by a State Departmentannouncement of a pact with Cuba that would have led to deportationof some of the inmates.   The report said ``takeovers as complete as those at Oakdale andAtlanta literally were unimagined.''   It said Oakdale officials ignored ``warning signs,'' includingan inmate food fight in the cafeteria, and said importantinformation was not conveyed to the warden or other officials.   On Atlanta, the report said Warden Joseph Petrovsky ``would haveattempted a lock-down had he received enough reliable informationthat a disturbance was likely.'' It said he was told by his staffthat Atlanta inmates were calm after the Oakdale rioting began.   ``In actuality,'' the report said, ``line staff had overhearddetainees' conversations about hostage-taking, received warningsfrom informants and noticed other indications of potential unrest.''   Thomas Boyd, assistant attorney general, acknowledged in aletter accompanying the report that Justice Department trainingprograms dealing with emergency responses and hostage situations``may be further improved.''</TEXT></DOC>
