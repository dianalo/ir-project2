<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-48-0537 </DOCNO><TEXT>The limiting factor for the lack of reproducibility in previous studiesof atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition of a-Si:H from Mg{sub2}Si generated higher silanes is contamination by gas phase dopant impurities,both n and p type originating from the higher silanes production system.An n-type impurity is shown to originate from the drying column. Afterelimination of this impurity, the a-Si:H films produced showed evidenceof p-type doping. Secondary ion mass spectroscopy analyses of the resultingfilms identify boron as the p-type dopant. The incorporation of boroninto the films was varied by preheating the reactant gas immediatelyprior to deposition. The ideal preheat temperature is shown to be between350 and 400 {sup 0}C. Films deposited with a preheat of 375 {sup 0}Cshowed no flow dependence of the hole diffusion length and the best electrontransport properties. Attempts at removing the boron impurity from thegas stream were also made. A Porapak Q/sup X/ column installed at theend of the drying column was found to be reasonably effective. Depositionsof a-Si:H were also made utilizing a commercially purified tank of Si{sub2}H{sub 6}. The lack of evidence of compensating or p-type doping inthis system firmly establishes the impurities as originating from theMg{sub 2}Si based silanes production system.</TEXT></DOC>
