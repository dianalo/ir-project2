Applicant is primarily engaged in the business of designing, developing,marketing, and supporting a product line of systems and applications microcomputersoftware for business and professional use, both directly and through controlledforeign companies. As of March 31, 1988, Applicant had non-cash short-terminvestments which would be classified as ``investment securities'' of $170,600,000,or 38.7% of the book value of Applicant's total assets of $441,000,000.Applicant believes that the fair market value of its investment securitiesis substantially less than 40% of the fair market value of Applicant'stotal assets as determined in good faith by Applicant's Board of Directorsin accordance with section 2(a)(41)(A) of the 1940 Act. Nevertheless, toavoid the possibility that it might be classified as an investment companyunder section 3(a)(3) of the 1940 Act, Applicant seeks an order declaringthat it is primarily engaged in a non-investment company business.2. Applicant was founded as a partnership in 1975. Subsequently, it wasincorporated in the State of Washington on June 25, 1981, and on December24, 1986, Applicant reincorporated in the State of Delaware by merginginto a Delaware corporation incorporated by the Applicant for that purpose.Applicant made its initial public offering under the Securities Act of1933 on March 13, 1986, and became a reporting company under the SecuritiesExchange Act of 1934 on the same date. Applicant's common stock is tradedover-the-counter on the NASDAQ National Market System. As of September28, 1987 (the record date for the most recent shareholders' meeting), officersand directors of the Applicant held 47.7% of Applicant's outstanding stockand Paul Allen, a founder of Applicant who is no longer affiliated withit, owned an additional 19.9% of the outstanding stock. As of March 31,1988, Applicant had 7,027 shareholders of record.3. Applicant markets over 40 software products, including three operatingsystems, computer language products in six computer languages, and businessapplications products in six categories: word processing, spreadsheet,file management, graphics, communications, and project management. Applicantmarkets and distributes its software products domestically and internationallythrough both the Original Equipment Manufacturer (``OEM'') and retail channels.In the OEM channel, Applicant generally provides an OEM with master copiesof systems software and documentation which the OEM duplicates, packages,and distributes. Domestic retail marketing involves the distribution ofApplicant's packaged applications software products primarily through independentdistributors, large volume dealers, and other dealers, and direct marketingto corporate customers, government agencies, and colleges and universities.International OEM and retail marketing and distribution of domestic andforeign language versions of Applicant's systems and applications softwareproducts are conducted through ten foreign subsidiaries and several independentsales representatives.<ITAG tagnum="84">Applicant's Legal Analysis</ITAG>1. Notwithstanding that the fair market value of its investment securitieshas at times exceeded 40% of the book value of the Applicant's total assets,Applicant believes it is primarily engaged in a non-investment companybusiness. Specifically, Applicant states that it is in the business ofdesigning, developing, marketing and supporting a line of systems and applicationsmicrocomputer software for business and professional use. Applicant notesthat in determining whether a company is primarily engaged in a non-investmentcompany business the SEC considers the following factors: (1) The company'shistorical development; (2) its public representations of policy; (3) theactivity of its officers and directors; (4) the nature of its present assets;and (5) the sources of its present income. 2. During Applicant's twelve-year history, its efforts have been devotedsolely towards becoming the leading producer of microcomputer software.Applicant is unaware of any public representations which would suggestthat it is in any business other than the microcomputer software business.The prospectus used in Applicant's March 1986 public offering, its reportsto shareholders, and its fillings with the SEC are all focused exclusivelyon Applicant's microcomputer software business. Moreover, during the fiscalyears ended June 30, 1986 and 1987, Applicant spent approximately 30% and25%, respectively, of its net revenues on sales and marketing that focusedentirely on Applicant's microcomputer software business.3. Applicant's directors and executive officers dedicate virtually allof their efforts toward furthering Applicant's efforts in the design, development,marketing, and support of its broad product line of systems and applicationsmicrocomputer software for business and professional use. Management ofApplicant's investments involves less than the equivalent of two full-timeemployees out of a total of approximately 1,750 employees. Further, ona fair market value basis (as opposed to book value), Applicant believesthat its investment securities represent far less than 40% of its totalassets. In addition, income generated from Applicant's investment securitiescomprise only a small portion of total revenue and total income. Applicantrepresents that since March 1986, income from investment securities hascomprised no more than 1.9% of total revenue and no more than 10.4% oftotal net income.4. Applicant's 1986 prospectus indicated that the net proceeds of its March1986 public offering would be used for general corporate purposes, principallyworking capital, product development, and capital expenditures. The prospectusalso stated that the proceeds might be used to acquire companies, products,or expertise which compliment Applicant's business, and, pending such usesthe proceeds would be invested in marketable securities. Applicant representsthat the proceeds of the offering, as well as funds generated from operatingresults, have been used in accordance with these representations. Moreover,Applicant has identified six areas where it anticipates substantial cashneeds in addition to its sizable operating cash requirements. These sixareas are: (i) Expenditures on Applicant's domestic equipment and facilities;(ii) expenditures on its foreign operations, including capital contributionsto several of its existing foreign subsidiaries; (iii) possible acquisitions;(iv) investments in operating companies, strategic alliances, and jointdevelopments; (v) possible payment of dividends; and (vi) a contingencyfund.5. Applicant asserts that subjecting it to the provisions of the 1940 Actwould force enormous changes in the nature of its business, create duplicativeand unnecessary protection for shareholders, cause Applicant to presentfinancial information in a potentially misleading format, and impose uponApplicant the expense of burdensome but unnecessary regulation. Consequently,Applicant concludes that the issuance of an order declaring that it isprimarily engaged in a non-investment company business would be in thepublic interest, as it would resolve any uncertainties respecting the presentstatus of Applicant and its ability to effectuate its business plans.<ITAG tagnum="84">Applicant's Conditions</ITAG>Applicant agrees that if the requested order is granted, it will continueto allocate and utilize its accumulated cash and short-term securitiesfor bona fide business purposes; and it will refrain from investing ortrading in securities for short-term speculative purposes.<ITAG tagnum="21">For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuantto delegated authority.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jonathan G.
