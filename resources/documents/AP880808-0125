The report by the Navy's inspector general, which focuses on theNaval Sea Systems Command, complains that ``in some case, it hasbecome difficult to determine where government workers' functionsstop and contractors' begin.''   There also is no question but that private consultants workingfor the Navy ``have been given access to information which shouldbe seen by only government personnel,'' the report states.   Contracts have been awarded to consultants to writespecifications, prepare cost estimates and monitor othercontractors, the report continues. And it is ``arguable'' whetherin the process, the command hasn't ``abdicated to contractors whoseprimary motive is profit'' the responsibility for protecting thepublic interest, the report concluded.   ``Through budget and contract review, it is estimated that (thecommand) will expend more than $500 million of its $708 millionfiscal 1988 contract support services budget for program managementsupport work more appropriately and traditionally performed bygovernment employees,'' it said.   The inspector general recommended the Navy command slash its useof outside contractors by 50 percent over the next three years andhold ``in abeyance'' any contracts whose purpose could not beclearly established.   The Navy said Monday the Sea Systems Command had yet to respondto those recommendations.   The inspector general's review was completed in April but didnot become public knowledge until Monday. The Navy declined torelease the document after it was described in the New York Times,but a copy was obtained from sources.   The Naval Sea Systems Command is the arm of the Navy responsiblefor procuring new ships and their on-board weapon systems.   The audit results are surfacing two months after the publicdisclosure of a long-running Justice Department investigation intodefense procurement fraud. That probe has led to search warrantsaimed at a variety of Defense Department and contractor officialsand outside consultants, although no indictments have been returnedas yet.   The Justice probe appears to focus on private consultants whosell their services to military contractors, promising ``inside''information on the government's procurement plans and the bids ofother firms.   Private consultants are frequently employed by the militaryservices as well, however, and the inspector general's reportcriticizes the Navy for its reliance on such consultants and theaccess to sensitive information they enjoy.   ``These problems, with their potential for conflict of interestand misuse of information, suggest the very circumstances involvingconsultants ... that appear to be at the very center of the currentprocurement fraud investigation,'' asserted Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis.,chairman of the House Armed Services Committee.   The inspector general's report is ``greatly troubling,'' Aspinadded in an Aug. 5 letter to Navy Under Secretary Lawrence Garrett.   The Navy said in a statement Monday the Sea Systems Command was``carefully evaluating the recommendations concerning its use ofcontractor support services'' and would respond ``through the chainof command.''   A Navy official who asked not to be named said, however, thecommand had turned to consultants because there were not enoughgovernment employees familiar with the highly technical aspects ofthe sophisticated weapons now being purchased.   Personnel restrictions imposed by Congress and the Office ofManagement and Budget in recent years have prevented the commandfrom hiring more workers itself, the source added.   Thus consultants have been hired to help the Navy decide whattypes of warships it should build; how they should be designed, andwhat yards should build them, the official said. Consultants alsoare assisting in overseeing contractor performance, the source said.   ``The Navy does not have any basic factual problems with thisreport,'' the source added. ``But given the circumstances, the SeaSystems Command also doesn't think it had much choice.''</TEXT></DOC>
