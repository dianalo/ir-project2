The first significant storms in three months dumped more than 2{inches of rain on parts of Michigan, but weather experts said itdidn't mean an end to the drought. The storms also blacked out atleast 155,000 electricity users and contributed to at least twodeaths, officials said Sunday.   ``To get a so-called end to the drought, to get us back to anormal amount of water in the reservoirs, we really need more of asteady rain over periods of time,'' meteorologist Don Baker saidSunday in Michigan. ``If it falls too fast, it tends to run off.What we really need is a lighter rain over a 12- to 24-hour period.We really need a lot.''   Iowa had a weekend of feast or famine, with some areas in thewest getting a double drenching while some scorched areas in theeast got little or no rain.   The first wave of rain was an offshoot of storms that sentdestructive tornadoes roaring through Council Bluffs, and someplaces got more than 5 inches of rain.   ``This is the best rain we've had all year,'' said Melba Wilcox,who farms with her husband near Bagley, Iowa. She said her raingauge showed 2.5 inches fell early Saturday. ``I went outside tomake sure it was real.''   Scattered thunderstorms spread rain over much of Kansas and intoparts of western Missouri. El Dorado, Kan., got 2.52 inches of rainin a day and a half and other parts of central and eastern Kansasgot up to 2 inches of rain in 24 hours.   But to the east and west it was just hot.   In San Francisco, the city by the bay known for cool weather,the mercury soared to 103 degrees in downtown Sunday, the city'shighest temperature since record-keeping began 125 years ago.   The heat heightened the danger of fire and and Californiaofficials closed Mount Diablo State Park in Contra Costa County,east of San Francisco, and parts of Mount Tamalpais, northwest ofthe city.   On the East Coast, Philadelphia hit a record high for the dateof 102 degrees, which was also a record fifth day in a row oftriple-digit highs. Downtown Baltimore set a record high for thedate of 103 degrees, and that was a record eighth time this yearthat the city has hit 100 degrees or better.   Newark, N.J., set a record-high temperature for the date of 100degrees, breaking the old high of 99 set in 1977. It was the fifthtime Newark topped 100 degrees this year.   Eastern Pennsylvania, Connecticut, New Jersey and New York werehit by severe thunderstorms late in the day.   National Weather Service forecasters said tempertures won't fallto normal levels in the 80s until Thursday. Forecaster DarylWilliams blamed the heat on a high-pressure area over thesouthwestern United States, which he said is keeping cooler Pacificair out of the area.</TEXT></DOC>
