Murphy became fed up with the railroad. Irked by high rates and poor service, Mr. Murphy, who owns a grain elevator in Winthrop, Iowa, switched to trucks.    But now, after a group of entrepreneurs bought the local rail line from the Illinois Central Gulf Railroad last year, he again ships by rail. The new owner, Chicago, Central andamp; Pacific Railroad, &quot;wants your business, and they'll bend over backwards to help you,&quot; Mr. Murphy says.    Chicago, Central andamp; Pacific is one of a slew of new railroads that are being created as major railroads sell lightly used tracks. More than 150 of them have been formed since 1980, compared with 47 during the 1970s, the Federal Railroad Administration says. Most are short lines with fewer than 100 miles, and some are much longer regional lines of more than 500 miles.    In addition to track, short line sales often include locomotives and equipment. The transactions have ranged from less than $1 million to $123 million.    The new railroads are gambling that by slimming costs and boosting service, they can pump life into rail lines considered losers by their previous owners.    Much of the track now being operated by short lines once might have been abandoned. But after the federal government deregulated the railroad industry in 1980, &quot;we were amazed at how many people came forward to buy these lines,&quot; a Consolidated Rail Corp. official says.    Major railroads say the line sales are part of the industry's restructuring. Illinois Central Gulf, which has sold large chunks of track, is leading the trend, soon to be followed by Burlington Northern Inc. and CSX Corp., which are planning big divestitures of their own. Increasingly, major railroads are concentrating on their high-density core routes while turning to low-overhead carriers to feed them local freight. &quot;If these new railroads are successful, it will help the whole railroad industry,&quot; says Peter Gilbertson, a Chicago, Central andamp; Pacific vice president.    But other railroad executives have misgivings. Some of the new companies operate track long neglected by the former owners and face big repair costs. Others lack the financial strength to weather economic downturns. Labor unions have attacked short lines, many of which are nonunion.    The new railroad often offers jobs to crews that had worked for the railroad that is selling the track, but in fewer numbers and with less-restrictive work rules.    The new short lines are &quot;whittling away wages and conditions of work that we built up over 100 years,&quot; says Daniel Collins, assistant general secretary and treasurer of the United Transportation Union. That union and others are lobbying Congress for legislation, fiercely opposed by the railroads, to protect jobs lost when short lines are created.    Nevertheless, railroads hail the benefits of the new companies. &quot;This line doesn't have to support a big, bureaucratic organization, and we can respond quickly to customers,&quot; said J.C. McIntyre, president of Dakota, Minnesota andamp; Eastern Railroad Corp., which last August bought 965 miles of track and trackage rights from CNW Corp.    For example, Dakota, Minnesota andamp; Eastern recently dispatched a train crew 60 miles to Aberdeen, S.D., to help a grain elevator there get freight cars a day ahead of schedule. Mr. McIntyre, who previously was a division manager for CNW's Chicago andamp; North Western Transportation Co. unit, says that by the time the former owner would have decided to send the crew, it would been &quot;two or three days, or never.&quot;    Just as important are the new railroads' flexible use of labor, which has become the envy of the major railroads. They don't have the rigid craft distinctions that the big railroads have, and they often run trains with two-man crews, half the industry average. Aided by the labor savings, the new railroads have reduced rates and increased service. &quot;You can do all sorts of wonderful things if you're a little railroad and you don't have all the work rules,&quot; says John Hall, assistant vice president, business development, of Burlington Northern Railroad.    It is too early to tell how the new owners will fare, but some of them point to early successes. Gulf andamp; Mississippi Corp., which bought track from Illinois Central Gulf, has cut rates to lure back wood fiber and other freight that had been lost to trucks. And Chicago, Central andamp; Pacific has rebuilt track and boosted service, much to the delight of Mr. Murphy, who owns the Iowa grain elevator.    The line's previous owner, Illinois Central Gulf, &quot;had priced itself out of the market,&quot; Mr. Murphy says, &quot;and you couldn't get the cars you needed.&quot; But he says such problems stopped after the line changed hands.    Illinois Central Gulf, a unit of IC Industries Co., shakes off the criticism. In the past few years, the company has generated more than $400 million by selling 3,000 miles, or about half its railroad routes. &quot;I'll take the cash,&quot; Harry Bruce, the rail unit's chairman, says. &quot;They can have the credit&quot; for improving service.    The new railroads face problems, though. Some owners lack experience. &quot;What I know about railroads, you could put in a thimble,&quot; says Nick Temple, formerly a Navy test pilot who owned convenience stores before becoming president of the Washington Central Railroad. Others have borrowed heavily to buy the lines and don't have money to make track repairs. On some lines, says John Riley, head of the Federal Railroad Administration, &quot;the weeds have grown so high that you almost need a metal detector to find the rails.&quot; Recently, Gulf andamp; Mississippi raised $8 million from a public stock offering and plans to use much of it to repair 200 miles of track over which its trains have been held to a maximum speed of 10 miles an hour.    Major railroads are preparing to sell even more of their systems to short lines. Burlington Northern, for example, is seeking buyers for as much as a third of its 26,000 miles of tracks, and CSX may dispose of a quarter of its 25,000-mile route system. John F. Kawa, a first vice president and railroad analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., estimates that during the next five years, major railroads may sell between 20% and 30% of their track.    Big railroads say the public will benefit. The new short lines are providing &quot;cheap, innovative transportation,&quot; says Mr. Hall, the Burlington Northern assistant vice president. &quot;They have been quite successful with the small and medium size customers we weren't doing well with.&quot; He said Burlington Northern also benefits because it reduces overhead but still retains freight traffic fed to it by the short lines.    Some railroads are resisting the trend. Norfolk Southern Corp. believes that its extensive network of branch and mainlines give it a marketing advantage. Though it is trying to sell some track in Georgia, Norfolk Southern currently isn't planning major divestitures. &quot;Customers like to deal with one railroad, a single system,&quot; says James McClellan, Norfolk Southern's director, corporate development.    Labor unions want to exert their influence on future sales to short lines. The unions are clamoring for legislation that would compel the Interstate Commerce Commission to impose labor protection in short line sales. The commission orders such protection for workers who lose their jobs when railroads abandon lines or sell them to other railroads, but not in cases when the purchaser is a new short line.    Naturally, railroads are worried that the unions may get their way. If required by legislation, such severance obligations would boost the costs of selling surplus track and &quot;severely curtail the short line movement,&quot; Mr. Hall says.    Another problem is that short lines fear that they will be in competition with major railroads for some shipments. More and more big railroads are turning to containers or truck trailers hauled on flat cars, and some are buying their own truck companies, allowing them to invade markets that once would have been captive to short lines.    But some short lines have won freight business from the big railroads. Several years ago, Delaware Otsego Corp., based in Cooperstown, N.Y., acquired track and trackage rights from Conrail. Last year, the railroad began to haul container trains for Sea-Land Corp. that previously had been handled by Conrail.    &quot;Every small railroad dreams about landing the big one,&quot; said Walter Rich, president and chief executive officer of Delaware Otsego. Nevertheless, Mr. Rich acknowledges problems. His hilly, curvy stretch of lightweight track through northern New Jersey can't beat Conrail's track for speed, and on a couple of occasions Sea-Land's trains have derailed.    ---       Ten Largest Short-Line Railroads Railroad                 Miles     Acquired Dakota, Minnesota        965          9/86 andamp; Eastern Railway Chicago, Central andamp;       772         12/85 Pacific Railroad Gulf andamp; Mississippi       713          7/85 Railroad Chicago, Missouri andamp;      682         Pending Western Railroad Iowa Interstate          552         11/84 Railroad Washington Central       430         10/86 Railroad MidSouth Rail            414          3/86 Paducah andamp;                311          8/86 Louisville Railway Otter Tail Valley        176         10/86 Railroad Eureka Southern          166         11/84 Railroad Source: Weiner, McCaffrey, Brodsky andamp; Kaplan P.C.</TEXT></DOC>
