Tissues were evaluated usinglight microscopic morphometry and scanning electron microscopy. The lungsfrom ozone-exposed 60-day-old rats had larger volume fractions of centriacinarlesions than lungs from exposed 444-day-old rats. Within each age groupthere was an observed dose response, with rats exposed to 0.80 ppm ozonehaving larger volume fractions of lesions than those exposed to 0.35ppm. Only the 444-day-old rats lost body weight during the exposure period.They also had smaller fixed lung volumes than same-aged controls. All60-day-old rats gained weight during the exposure period, although ratsexposed to 0.80 ppm ozone gained less than filtered air controls. Lesionsobserved in both age groups of female rats were qualitatively similarto those previously described in young adult male rats. We conclude thatthere are age-related differences in the morphometric responses of ratsto ozone exposure. Younger rats had larger proportions of centriacinarlesions and macrophages while older rats had greater body weight andlung volume changes.</TEXT></DOC>
