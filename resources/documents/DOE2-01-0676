The key factors which willcontribute to the establishment of manufacturing capability for earlylarge-scale deployment of consumer and commercial solar electric systemsare the following: unique physical properties ideally suited for pv devices;flexibility of design of pv cell structures; ease of fabrication of large-area,multigap tandem-junction cells for achieving high conversion efficiencyand long-term optical stability; use of inexpensive large-area, substratematerials; development of automated, continuous, roll-to-roll manufacturingprocess for depositing solar cell structures; development of large-areamonolithic pv panels; development of low-weight, portable, flexible,damage resistant solar panels; low materials and process costs; earlycommercialization of pv products. These factors are discussed, reviewingfindings and accomplishments deemed relevant to early successful commercializationof a-Si alloy solar electric devices and systems. An evaluation of relativemerits of different fabrication approaches is also attempted.</TEXT></DOC>
