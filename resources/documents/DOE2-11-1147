Both machines demonstrated they couldwork in the demanding mining environment, successfully follow the continuousminer, and transport all the product the miner could deliver. Futureapplications and potential for continuous haulage seem bright, howevermore continuous mining is necessary to realise their full productivitypotential. 7 refs., 4 figs., 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
