In addition, Pittsburgh-based Joy said it was considering a sale of the company, possibly through a leveraged buyout, among other moves designed to &quot;enhance value&quot; for shareholders.    Eugene J. O'Sullivan, vice president and treasurer of Joy, hinted that the company might announce a stock buyback as part of a contemplated restructuring. Joy, a maker of oil field and petroleum equipment and coal-mining machinery, is &quot;looking at the financial structure of the company,&quot; he said, adding that the possible outcome &quot;might entail an increase in the amount of (the company's) leverage.&quot;    Joy said the offer by Pullman-Peabody, a Princeton, N.J.-based supplier of material-handling and food service equipment, was &quot;inadequate and not in the best interests of the company and its shareholders and could adversely affect Joy's employees, suppliers, customers and communities in which Joy operates.&quot; Citing an opinion from First Boston Corp., its financial adviser, Joy said the offer was &quot;inadequate from a financial point of view.&quot;    In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, Joy closed at $31.75, up 50 cents.    Thomas M. Begel, Pullman-Peabody's chairman and chief executive officer, said he is &quot;dismayed&quot; by the board's action. &quot;We're surprised that they rejected it without further discussion,&quot; Mr. Begel said. &quot;I would think the board and (Joy's chairman and president A. William) Calder would want to discuss the matter rather than simply reject it.&quot;    Mr. Begel added that if Joy is considering alternatives to Pullman-Peabody's offer, its actions will hurt shareholders because they will lose certain tax benefits. &quot;It would be impossible for alternative negotiations to take place and to get the cash in shareholders' hands in time to meet year-end deadlines for receiving favorable captial gains rates,&quot; he said.    Although this is the first formal rejection by Joy of the offer, there were previous indications that the company would resist the bid. Mr. Begel previously said that Joy rebuffed Pullman-Peabody's initial efforts to negotiate a friendly merger. Pullman-Peabody recently paid about $18 million to acquire 750,000 Joy shares, representing about a 4.2% stake.    The tender offer for Joy's remaining 17 million shares outstanding began Dec. 2 and will expire at 12:01 a.m. EST Dec. 31, unless extended.    Joy has adopted poison-pill provisions designed to thwart an unwanted takeover. Pullman-Peabody's offer is conditioned on the recision of the provisions, which include a &quot;pension parachute&quot; designed to deprive a hostile raider of excess pension funds.    But Joy said its board &quot;may not&quot; amend the pension parachute unless the Pullman offer is withdrawn. Joy also said &quot;it would be inappropriate to redeem&quot; the stock purchase rights previously assigned to holders of common stock. The rights are triggered in the event of a hostile takeover attempt and entitle holders to buy one newly issued share of Joy common at an exercise price of $75 a share. The rights will trade separately from the common after Thursday.    Although Joy said a possible leveraged buyout wouldn't necessarily include company management, it nevertheless said its board authorized as much as $500,000 for legal and financial advice in connection with a management-led buyout. In a leveraged buyout, a group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing. The debt ultimately is paid through the acquired company's operations or a sale of its assets.    Mr. O'Sullivan said that Joy didn't plan to solicit a potential buyer for the company, &quot;but will entertain specific offers. We will not be getting on the phone and calling specific individuals.&quot;    Mr. Begel said that Pullman is willing to negotiate all aspects of its offer. But he said, &quot;One of the least negotiable (aspects) is price.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
