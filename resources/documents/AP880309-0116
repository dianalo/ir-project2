Three former police detectives for the Brooklyn districtattorney's office were among 11 people arrested following raidsMonday at 15 sites in New York City and on Long Island, ManhattanDistrict Attorney Robert Morgenthau said.   The ring raised $600,000 a year since setting up the fraudulentcharity 10 years ago, Morgenthau said Tuesday. The ring operatedunder two names: the Police Conference of New York Inc. and the NewYork State District Attorney Police Benevolent Association.   The groups are not registered with the state as charities. Theauthorities said the groups kept all but about $4,000 a year, whichwas spent on insurance they sold to police officers on Long Island.   The operation was run by Joseph Tarantola, 48, of Tannersville,Pa., who was a detective in the Brooklyn district attorney's officeuntil he was fired in 1976 because of questionable fund-raisingactivities, Morgenthau said.   Also arrested were two of his associates who held the same post:Neil Lombardo, 44, of Brooklyn, a detective from 1970 to 1983; andClark Simmons, 66, of Brooklyn, a detective from 1969 to 1977.   The district attorney said Tarantola's group, in business forseveral years, used solicitors operating out of ``boiler rooms'' tocall and pressure potential contributors, most of them businessmen.   The solicitors would call and claim connections to legitimatepolice groups. They would refer to news accounts of officerswounded or killed on duty and appeal to the donor's sympathy orsense of civic duty to get money.   If the solicitor got a donation, he would send the giver asouvenir imprinted with an official-looking badge and slogan.Souvenirs included decals, baseball caps, lapel pins shaped likebadges and large metal shields designed to be affixed to a carbumper. A donor's gift determined which souvenir he got.   ``They would tell the contributor that having this decal on yourwindow is like having the chief in your backseat,'' the districtattorney said.   The solicitor received a percentage of donations, Morgenthausaid.   The investigation into the ring began in July 1985 after peoplecomplained they were being harassed, Morgenthau said.   Authorities raided 15 suspected boiler room sites Monday inManhattan, the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens, and on Long Island inHempstead and Massapequa.   Tarantola and nine others arrested were charged withfirst-degree scheming to defraud, punishable by up to four years inprison. An 11th person was arrested on a weapons possession chargefor allegedly having an unlicensed pistol.</TEXT></DOC>
