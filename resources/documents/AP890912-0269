(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Hewlett-Packard Co. introduced alow-cost workstation Tuesday, the first computer product unveiledsince it acquired its former rival, Apollo Computer Inc.   The electronics company, which bought Apollo last April for $476million, announced the Apollo Series 2500, its lowest costworkstation. Priced at $3,990, it's also one of the cheapest in thefield.   The workstation uses a 68030 microprocessor from Motorola Inc.and comes with 4 megabytes of internal memory and a monochromedisplay monitor. But unlike more advanced workstations, it's notcapable of displaying color graphics.   David Perozek, general manager of H-P's Apollo Systems division,said the Apollo Series 2500 had been planned before theHewlett-Packard purchase and proved the two companies were workingwell together.   But analysts said Hewlett-Packard is not assured of holding on toits lead in workstations, or powerful desktop computers, unless itcreates bold products that can compete with industry leaders such asSun Microsystems Inc. of Mountain View.   The 2500 runs software developed for Apollo's line ofworkstations, which use a version of the Unix operating system knownas Domain. H-P uses its own version of Unix. The two companies saidthey plan to offer software that will work with both computer lines,but that they will not be available for two to three years.   Seymour Merrin, president of Merrin Information Services, a PaloAlto consulting firm, said Hewlett-Packard had to unveil a low-costproduct to be competitive with Sun. He also said the currentworkstation price war will make it hard for companies to get enoughprofits from their products.   ``You can't afford to sell those things at that price,'' saidMerrin. ``The bigger companies will be able to take a hit for awhileand the smaller ones will not. Dropping prices like that is crazy,but competitively you've got to be there,'' Merrin said.   H-P's Apollo division also announced on Tuesday graphics softwareand hardware products for use with top-of-the line Apolloworkstations. With prices ranging from $20,000 to $35,000, thedesktop visualization system allows engineers to see clearrepresentations of their designs simulated on a computer screen.</TEXT></DOC>
