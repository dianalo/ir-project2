The development of the code is aimed at efficientand systematic preparation of the SAF data files for several differenthuman phantoms in a suitable form as a direct input data file to DOSimetricDAta Calculation system, DOSDAC, which is being developed at Japan AtomicEnergy Research Institute, JAERI. This document describes the methodologyused in the code, the code structure, user's information including theway of implementing the code on FACOM/M-380, and the performance throughcalculation and preparation of the SAF data file. In order to show theperformance of the code, a set of the SAF values for an adult human phantomwas calculated and was organized to prepare the SAF file. Comparing thecalculated SAF values with those tabulated in ORNL-5000, the qualityof the code was examined.</TEXT></DOC>
