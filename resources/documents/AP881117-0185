(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A 30-pound package carrying fourexperiments and 52 envelopes rocketed 14,000 feet high and wasrecovered despite parachute failure Thursday in what was touted asthe first private commercial space flight.   A 10-foot rocket not much bigger than those launched by weekendhobbyists burned for 4.4 seconds as it propelled the payload over afive-minute course, dropping it into the Atlantic Ocean two milesoffshore.   Officials of E'Prime Aerospace Co. reported the main parachutedid not open but that a smaller pilot chute did work and wassufficient to land the payload safely. Divers recovered it in goodcondition.   Jim Mizell, E'Prime operations director, said a flight monitoringexperiment to measure acceleration and temperatures failed tooperate during the flight but that the other experiments went well.He reported slight water seepage into the payload section.   Ken Havekotte, a space stamp enthusiast, said some of theenvelopes, bearing covers commemorating the flight, got damp, butthey were dried out and most were mailed to collectors.   E'Prime, of nearby Titusville, hopes the success will lead toinvestor interest in the company so it eventually can buy biggerrockets capable to orbiting commercial space payloads. Stockholdersand potential investors were among the 200 people who watched theliftoff from the beach, half a mile from the launch pad.   In trying to attract investors, E'Prime billed the flight as the``first truly commercial space flight.'' But by the company's owndefinition, space starts 75 miles up. And NASA has launched severalcommercial payloads for paying customers over the years.   However, it was the first time a privately owned rocket had beenlaunched from either Air Force or NASA facilities here.   The company paid the Air Force $24,000 for use of of an oldweather rocket launch pad and some support services. It also had tobuy $1 million in liability insurance to cover any damage to AirForce property.   Mizell, a former NASA engineer, said the experiments on board therocket were from paying customers. He declined to say how much theyhad paid except that it was not enough to make the flightprofitable. A high school teacher whose class developed one of theexperiments said they paid $5.   He estimated the total the fledgling company has spent so far at$200,000.   The so-called ``commercialization of space,'' to bring theprivate sector into the launching of satellites and other spaceactivity, has been a major goal of the Reagan administration.   Mizell said his company has a long way to go before it can becomea viable provider of commercial launch services for space payloads.He noted that Thursday's flight had been delayed a year while thecompany met the government's financial, safety and techncialrequirements.   He said E'Prime hopes to launch a second rocket of the same sizeearly next year.   The flight Thursday was called LOFT-1, for Launch OperationsFlight Test. The rocket carried a biology experiment from aHuntsville, Ala., high school; a thin-film polymer experiment fromMorton Thiokol Inc. and Utah State University; the flight monitoringsystem for measuring acceleration and temperature from QSI Corp. andWeber State College in Utah; and a data collection and telemetrysystem from the University of Alabama at Huntsville.   Jayne Russell, a teacher at J.O. Johnson High School inHuntsville, said the biology experiment involved sending plant seedsinto space. They will be planted and their growth rates comparedwith those of other seeds.</TEXT></DOC>
