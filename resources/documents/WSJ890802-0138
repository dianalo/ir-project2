The plan to enhance audits with computers cost $187 million through fiscal 1988. It's &quot;plagued by escalating costs, schedule delays, and elusive benefits,&quot; the General Accounting Office tells Congress. The administration even cut the project's 1990 budget request 82% to $19.5 million, the GAO says, approvingly. The IRS can't show that equipping auditors with 18,000 portable computers -- the only operational step so far -- has led to more audits or tax revenue.    A national system was to be ready this year and cost $1 billion; now it's scheduled for 1995 and $1.8 billion. The GAO questions the benefits estimate of $16.2 billion over nine years and the IRS's ability to merge the system into its overall processing-modernization program, in view of computer-software and other problems. Before investing more, the IRS must improve its strategy and benefits analyses, the GAO says.    A spokesman says the IRS is rethinking the system and still feels it can be beneficial and cost-effective.    CHARITY DEDUCTIONS clash with credits for restoring a historic building.    To foster preservation, credits are allowed for rehabilitating certified historic property. But if a restorer disposes of a building before the end of its useful life, a proportional part of the credit must be recaptured-repaid as tax. Thus, the limits on aiding such a worthy cause are complex, as IRS Revenue Ruling 89-90 shows. It concerns the sale or charitable gift to a local historical society of a facade easement -- the right to control the outward appearance of a historic structure.    If, after getting a credit, a taxpayer sells an easement to an exempt society, that is a partial disposition, the IRS says, so part of the credit in proportion to the easement's market value must be recaptured. The same is true of a donation for which the restorer takes a charitable deduction. The law makes no exception for donations of easements.    THIS HOME COMPUTER was required by omission, not commission.    An employee's own home computer may not be deducted as a business cost unless its use is for the employer's convenience and required as an employment condition. Still, that use needn't be required explicitly, as the Tax Court told a Champaign, Ill., couple. Professor Thomas C. Cadwallader taught psychology; Judy C. Douglas was a public-transportation planner. Their employers neither provided access to a computer nor required the purchase of one.    Still, the law demands only that a computer be required in order to perform duties properly. Cadwallader and Douglas needed a computer to manage and process massive quantities of research and work data properly, Judge Clapp found. Also, their computer spared their employers the cost of providing such equipment and thus was purchased for the employers' convenience. The judge let the couple deduct the computer.    But the judge denied Cadwallader's home-office deduction because the focal point and the dominant part of his activities were on campus.    CIGARETTE TAXES, the butt of revenue seekers, have been raised in 13 states in 1989. Increases run from one cent a pack in Oregon to 15 cents in Nevada. Connecticut's 14-cent rise gives it the highest state excise tax -- 40 cents, the Tobacco Institute says. Legislators in seven other states still are considering proposed increases.    TAX REAX TO FAX. Four of the 10 IRS service centers -- those in Ogden, Utah; Fresno, Calif.; Kansas City, Mo., and Cincinnati -- now accept facsimile transmissions from practitioners of documents needed to help resolve audit, collection and other matters for their clients.    GOLDBERG'S PICK for IRS chief counsel is said to be Abraham N.M. Shashy Jr., 39, a partner in the Dallas office of Jones, Day, Reavis andamp; Pogue. Goldberg became commissioner July 5. The post of chief counsel has been vacant since Nov. 1.    SHORE LORE FOR THE CORPS: A Marine captain may not pay tax by giving up 60 days of accumulated leave, says IRS private ruling 8928016. Income taxes must be paid in legal tender, meaning cash, it says.    SALES-TAX DEMANDS on out-of-state retailers will be tested anew in two cases. The actions succeed North Dakota's recently settled suit against Spiegel Inc.; the Chicago-based mail-order merchant has decided to collect taxes even in states where it has no facilities or agents. The new rival suits -- one filed by North Dakota and one sponsored by the Direct Marketing Association -- are aimed again at a 1967 Supreme Court decision that favors retailers.    In a North Dakota court, the state seeks to require collections on its behalf by Quill Corp. of Lincolnshire, Ill., a privately owned concern that sells office equipment by direct mail; the state believes it ultimately can get the 1967 decision reversed. Conversely, the trade group backs a California suit by Sturbridge Yankee Workshop Inc. of Westbrook, Maine, that is relying on the Supreme Court opinion to defeat California's demands on out-of-state retailers.    The trade group believes its suit can reach the Supreme Court in about three years -- and win reaffirmation.    BRIEFS: A bill to require tax withholding for farm workers is proposed by Rep. Panetta (D., Calif.); he says they fail to report $1.3 billion in annual income. . . . The House passed a fiscal 1990 budget for the IRS of $5.56 billion, $14.9 million more than the administration sought. </TEXT></DOC>
