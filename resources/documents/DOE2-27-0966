<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-27-0966 </DOCNO><TEXT>A novel surface-emitting semiconductor laser with a vertical resonator,extremely short gain length, and enhanced gain at a specific design wavelengthhas been demonstrated. The gain medium consists of a series of GaAs quantumwells separated by AlGaAs spacers whose thicknesses are chosen to beone-half the wavelength of a particular transition in the quantum wells.This structure forces the antinodes of the standing-wave optical fieldto coincide with the gain elements, enhancing the gain and frequencyselectivity in the vertical direction and substantially reducing amplifiedspontaneous emission. We have achieved optically pumped lasing with athreshold of 6 MW/cm{sup 2} at room temperature in a molecular beam epitaxiallygrown structure of thickness 4.3 {mu}m, of which only 320 nm providedgain.</TEXT></DOC>
