Seattle's law went into effect Nov. 27, after years of attemptsby some officials and downtown businessmen alarmed by pushybeggars. The law has served as a model for at least two othercities.   ``There has been a significant reduction in the amount ofaggressive behavior along with panhandling,'' said Capt. JimDeschane, commander of the city's West Precinct, which includes thePioneer Square district, where many confrontations took placebefore the ordinance went into effect.   ``Some of them were pretty frightening,'' said John Gilmore,executive vice president of the Downtown Seattle Association. ``Idon't see them there anymore.''   Still, on July 9, a man who told a woman panhandler to get a jobwas knocked unconscious by the woman's boyfriend, and died two dayslater, authorities said. James Nightwolf, who had a record ofviolent behavior, was charged with second degree murder, saidhomicide Sgt. Joe Sanford.   The ordinance, which prohibits panhandlers from intimidating orblocking passersby, carries a maximum penalty of 90 days in jailand a $500 fine.   Minneapolis enacted an ordinance in February making it illegalto use offensive language, grab or follow someone if it``reasonably tends to arouse alarm or anger.'' Violations arepunishable by up to 90 days in jail and $700 fines.   ``It really hasn't been as effective an ordinance as it couldbe,'' said Van White, the councilman who sponsored Minneapolis'ordinance. ``If (police) would just begin to arrest and take themoff the street, and get them a warning that they can go to court.''   Minneapolis police Lt. Michael Fisher said he could not say howmany arrests had been made, because begging is lumped with publicdrunkenness and similar offenses. ``The ordinance made it easier toprosecute. It didn't make it easier to enforce,'' he said.   A similar ordinance, enacted in Portland, Ore., in April 1987,wasn't specifically aimed at begging but prohibits interfering withpedestrians or with people leaving and entering public or privateproperty. The law has been used to arrest anti-abortion protestersas well as street people.   ``That particular ordinance has been a failure as far as doingwhat I expected it to do,'' said Lou Wachsmuth, owner of Dan andamp;Louis Oyster Bar in downtown Portland. The panhandlers ``have nofear of the police. I tell them to leave, and they tell me to gojump in the lake.''   Portland police Capt. Roberta Webber acknowledged that theordinance has been used sparingly. ``The problem is that we have tosee (an offense) occurring. Most people who are harassed don'treport it,'' she said.   The city commission in Tulsa, Okla., approved an ordinance July15, based on Seattle's, that makes it a violation to repeatedly beg_ more than once an hour _ for money or to obstruct a pedestrian'spassage while begging. Violators can be fined $100.   Seattle police made 121 arrests under its law in the first halfof this year, but Deschane said the threat of arrest has been mostimportant for officers.   ``They can simply warn people, which works remarkably well,'' hesaid.   Aggressive panhandling, which was the most frequent complaint inthe precinct last summer, has dropped below on-the-street narcoticsdealing and public drinking this summer, Deschane said.   Bill Hobson, director of the Downtown Emergency Services Center,said official concern is overblown. In five years working downtown,he said, he never witnessed such panhandling.   ``It seems to me, most of it is done in an almost polite,ingratiating fashion,'' he said, adding many of downtown's beggarsare impaired by mental illness and alcoholism.   A municipal court judge in May ruled that Seattle's ordinancewas unconstitutionally vague, but Deschane said other municipaljudges have not embraced that view. Until a higher court rules, hesaid, ``we're still enforcing the law.''   Gilmore said the business association is trying to persuadethose who give to beggars to donate instead to shelters serving thehomeless. In New York, where there is no ordinance against begging,Mayor Edward I. Koch made a similar suggestion last week.   The Seattle association publishes a brochure that gives thisadvice: ``Give a hand, not a handout.''</TEXT></DOC>
