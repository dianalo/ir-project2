<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-78-0751 </DOCNO><TEXT>The Null DTE Fifo was designed to buffer data between two modem pair linksin a multi-segment communications circuit. Data buffering assures thatvalid data are being clocked into the local modems of both links. Withoutthis active data buffer, constant phase errors between the two localmodems' clocks may cause data errors, and thus, unacceptable circuitthroughput. During the course of communication circuit design, a setof communications symbols was developed to aid in the process. Thesesymbols not only simplify circuit design, but provide a standard setto minimize interpretation problems among the circuit designers. Thesymbol set can be used to represent various devices in a circuit, suchas modems, computers, terminals, encryption devices, converters, etc.In addition, the propagation of clock, data, and control signals throughthe circuit can be represented. Clocking modes on synchronous components(modems, multiplexers, etc.) and signal line crossovers can be determinedfrom the drawings during the design process. This set of symbols, alongwith the rules of their use, comprise a very efficient design tool.</TEXT></DOC>
