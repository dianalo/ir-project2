For the maintenanceof industrial health and safety for the workers in the companies andfor the medical, professional and social rehabilitaion after an accidentthe so-called ''Berufsgenossenschaften'' (professional trade associations)are responsible. For employees in nuclear industry two trade associationsare competent: - the Trade Association for Precision Engineering andElectrical Engineering for the 6,000 employees in nuclear power plants,- the Trade Association of the Chemical Industry for the 4,000 employeesin fuel element fabrication and the reprocessing companies. In case ofan accident workers from service companies e.g. construction and installationcompanies could be affected as well. Therefore these trade associationshave founded a couple of years ago an ''Institute for Radiation Protection''.A special task of this institute is First Aid to overexposed people incase of radiation accidents. In addition, it organizes the 24-hours-serviceof the seven Regional Radiation Protection Centers of Federal Republicof Germany.
