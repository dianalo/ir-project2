Until this point, firefighting had been concentrated on the warehouse, the pump house buildingand one exposed tank. With the release of this gasoline, the ruptureof the tanks was a foregone conclusion, because they were not equippedwith emergency relief vents. The determined stand of the fire fightersafter this occurred was commendable. Though still unknown, the sourceof the gasoline vapors in the pump house probably was a leak. A sparkfrom the ordinary electrical wiring or open motors was the probable sourceof ignition. The horizontal shearing of the shell along the top of twoof the tanks was most unusual and noteworthy. No definite explanationfor this type of failure can be offered. However, it is known that horizontaltanks will corrode at the bottom, with consequent shell weakening. Thesetanks could have been rotated 180{sup 0} on their axes at some earliertime, a relatively common practice, and the corroded metal coupled withthe fire's heat at the top of the tank could have resulted in such failures.During fire, this type of failure does not introduce the hazards of anend failure, which can cause tanks to rocket. Lack of dikes in such acongested area was a factor in the spread of the fire.</TEXT></DOC>
