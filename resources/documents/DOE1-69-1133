The device, which collectsions from the interaction of the beam with residual gas molecules, givesa fast, non-destructive readout, measuring the entire beam profile ina short time interval. It covers a large dynamic range, from less than10/sup 10/ to over 2x10/sup 13/ protons per pulse, when the signal levelis adjusted by controlling the local gas pressure and the integratingtime. It can see changes in the beam with a time resolution of about0.1 ms, except at low intensities where longer integration times areneeded to get sufficient signal strength. However, the forces due tothe space-charge of the circulating beam cause the ions to move in acurved path to the collector, distorting the profile and changing themeasured beam size. In the worst situation at the AGS - high currentbeams at high energy, when the size has damped down to less than 2mmrms width - this distortion is substantial and must be understood andcorrected, if possible, to properly interpret the measured beam sizes.This paper develops a model for this distortion, and formulas for correctingit. It is shown that the distortion is more severe than originally recognized,and that accurate quantitative measurements at the highest beam densitiesin the AGS are not possible. At lower densities, however, the correctionis small and the IPM can give a good beam size measurement.</TEXT></DOC>
