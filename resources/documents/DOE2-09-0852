Regional input-output models for Nevadaand the counties of Elko, Eureka, Lander, Nye, and White Pine were developedthrough IMPLAN, the U.S. Forest Service's economic impact model. From1981 to 1986 gold and silver production in Nevada grew at a faster ratethan the total production of all goods and services measured by the grossstate product. Other nonfuel mineral production however declined, withdirect employment and earnings losses offsetting the employment and earningsgains from increased gold and silver mining. These changes also generatedindirect impacts on employment and earnings for other industries, whichvaried for each region according to population, industrial diversification,and the types of minerals mined. Findings show that several county economiesare quite sensitive to changes in nonfuel mineral production.</TEXT></DOC>
