<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-08-1254 </DOCNO><TEXT>The gain of a beam feedback circuit, and consequently the damping it produces,is inversely proportional to the beam energy, proportional to the squareroot of the power applied to the feedback electrodes, and also stronglydependent on the geometry of these electrodes. Selecting a type of electrodeor comparing different configurations can be simplified if one characterizeseach geometry with a figure of merit. This report presents the evaluationof such a parameter for the case of the excitation electrodes used onSPEAR; a more efficient design is suggested and a tentative set of electrodesis proposed for the deflection of the PEP beams. 7 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
