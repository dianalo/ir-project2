Ballots were mailed to 17,593 union members on Friday, with avote count scheduled for Dec. 18.   The meeting at the Seattle Center Coliseum took place lateSunday afternoon less than three weeks after settlement of thestrike by the International Association of Machinists and AerospaceWorkers, the longest strike against the world's largest commercialjet builder in 41 years.   In another development Sunday, Boeing Helicopters union workersratified a contract similar to that accepted by the Machinists, thecompany said in a statement.   The pact covering about 3,000 United Aerospace Workers Local1069 workers at the Boeing Co. division outside Philadelphia isretroactive to Oct. 5, when the old contract was set to expirebefore being extended day-to-day as talks continued.   The statement did not give a ratification vote. Union officialscould not be reached at their headquarters.   SPEEA, which claims to be the largest outside the AFL-CIOrepresenting engineers and technicians, has never called a walkoutand has no strike fund, but many at the meeting carried signscalling for members to reject the contract and authorize a strike.   One banner read, ``Thanks, Ebeneezer.''   The booing got loudest when Bofferding spoke.   ``Quite honestly, it is the wage proposal that keeps us fromrecommending this contract,'' he said. ``It is everything else thatkeeps us from recommending against it.''   Daniel M. Mahoney, the union's general counsel, said before themeeting that the bargaining team had determined that SPEEA members``are literate and well educated and could decide for themselveshow to vote.''   One three-year offer covers 15,245 scientists and engineers, andthe other is for 12,796 technical support workers.   Engineers and scientists, with average pay of nearly $40,000 ayear, would get a 4 percent wage increase and a productivity bonusof 10 percent of gross pay in the first year but no furtherincreases.   Technicians, with average pay of about $28,000, would get annualwage increases of 3 percent, 2 percent and 2 percent and bonuses of10 percent, 5 percent and 4 percent.   In his 14 years with the union, Mahoney said the last time hecould remember a recommendation to reject a contract was in 1980,and it was approved anyway. He also said neither side expected astrike this time.   Members also are voting on whether to authorize union leaders tocall a walkout, so they could reject one or both offers withoutgranting strike authorization, leaving leadership in a quandary,Mahoney said.   ``That's a definite possibility,'' he said. ``We've kicked thataround a lot.''   Boeing officials have expressed satisfaction that the offersannounced Dec. 1 are going to a vote and say they expect approval.   The Machinists settled for a three-year contract with wageincreases of 4, 3 and 3 percent; bonuses of 10, 5 and 4 percent ofgross pay and an improvement in the cost-of-living formula fromabout 83 percent of inflation to nearly 100 percent. The bonuspackage represented an 8 percent increase over Boeing's lastprestrike offer.   The Machinists represent about 57,800 Boeing workers.</TEXT></DOC>
