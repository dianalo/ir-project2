Paul Davis, is as experienced andbattle-hardened as they come.andP;  He sold Univac 1s in a past life, founded fourcompanies and retired three years ago to enjoy the good life in SantaBarbara, Calif.andM;Davis, who joined Award's board in January, became president in June aftercompany founder Rene Vishney decided the company needed a veteran businessmanat the helm.andP;  That enabled Vishney to move over to Award's Munich office,where his skills in launching a startup are spearheading the development ofEastern European markets.andM;Davis is now implementing an Avis-like strategy aimed at winning over Phoenixaccounts through improved service and support as well as a diverse line ofthird-party proprietary products that complement Award's BIOS and enable PCmakers to offer custom machines in a market that is increasinglycommodity-driven.andM;&quot;I'm going right after Phoenix accounts,&quot; said Davis, who claims to havewrested a couple of PC makers away from Phoenix, although he declined toidentify them.andM;Phoenix lost $22 million in the last 12 months and has reduced its work forceafter a failed attempt to branch out into new markets such as Unix, whichdrained resources and defused the company's focus.andP;  Nonetheless, with morethan 250 employees, Phoenix still has four times the staff of Award and abouttwice the revenues.andM;With the gauntlet thrown, Davis took his show on the road last month to theFar East.andP;  He renewed a distribution agreement with the $30 billion,Tokyo-based Kanematsu Corp., signed up three new accounts, and generally tookthe pulse of the Asian PC market.andM;Last week, Davis was set to announce the first deals that will typify the newAward: a marketing contract with Ballard Synergy Corp., a SCSI softwaredevelopment firm in Cupertino, Calif.; and a deal with Micro Control Systems,an Irving, Texas, firm that sells an EISA configuration utility.andM;&quot;We represent a distribution channel for companies that don't [have anestablished channel],&quot; Davis said.andP;  &quot;We now deal in a global market, and anycustomer we sell BIOSs to is a potential customer&quot; for the third-partysoftware.andM;Award will incorporate the Ballard SCSI software into the BIOS chip and reap50 percent of the gross profit of each order.andP;  Davis said the deal could beworth $15 million to $25 million to Award in the next three years.andM;Next up for Award will be a series of graphics software products that thecompany will offer with its BIOS line.andP;  With deals like this, the companywill be able to offer PC makers a faster time to market for custom products.andM;By forming alliances with companies that can piggyback on Award's worldwidedistribution channel, Davis is betting he can boost the firm's currentrevenues of $10 million to $150 million in the next three years.andM;That's an ambitious goal that might require some deep pockets.andP;  Davis isalready talking with banks about extending Award's line of credit.andP;  Heshould, at least, find open doors.andM;And Davis is willing to sell as much as 10 percent of Award to the rightcomputer company in a deal structured like the one in which Apple Computeracquired 20 percent of Adobe Systems and became a major customer for thethen-fledgling startup.andM;It's an ambitious strategy, but one that Davis relishes after being out ofthe business for three years.andP;  Next month he jets to Europe to check out theemerging Eastern European markets.andP;  It's an action-packed schedule that seemsto energize the well-tanned 57-year-old.andP;  &quot;We're going to be Avis.andP;  We'regoing to be No.andP;  1,&quot; Davis said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
