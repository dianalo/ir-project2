A spokesman said the office was obliged to launch the investigation, with an eye to the potential effect on competition, under the terms of the Fair Trading Act, which stipulates that a &quot;merger situation&quot; exists if a company holds sufficient shares in another company so as to be able to &quot;materially influence&quot; the policies of that company.    The London-based investment arm of the Kuwaiti government hasn't launched a takeover bid for BP and has said its holding represents a &quot;long-term investment.&quot; The British Treasury said on Jan. 8 that it had been assured by Kuwait that it has no ambition to control BP and doesn't intend to press for any management role in the British oil company. </TEXT></DOC>
