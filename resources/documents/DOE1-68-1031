The methodsadopted to study the uncertainties depend on the performance measuresdefined by regulatory agencies, the long time spans for which performancemust be evaluated, and the nature and extent of uncertainties. Afterproviding some background information on the basalt site and nature ofapplicable regulatory requirements an application of the Monte Carlomethod to the total system performance is discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
