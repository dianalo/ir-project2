Reynolds Tobacco Co. unit plans to offer early-retirement incentives to about 17% of its U.S. work force.    The company said 2,800 hourly workers received the offers yesterday in a move to trim its payroll by year's end. It expects to eliminate additional jobs following completion of a major study, to be conducted over the next several months by tobacco executives.    Reynolds Tobacco said the offer's aim is to increase its operating efficiencies and strengthen its competitive position.    Some analysts said many hourly jobs can be eliminated following the opening of Reynolds's giant Tobaccoville manufacturing complex near Winston-Salem, North Carolina, which is expected to be in full production by year's end. Reynolds has described the plant as the world's largest cigarette factory and the most highly automated production facility in any industry.    The announcement is another way of saying &quot;technology is overwhelming the need for manual labor,&quot; said David A. Goldman, an analyst with L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin. A cutback was expected, given the opening of a plant capable of processing &quot;twice as many cigarettes with one-third less labor,&quot; he said.    RJR has maintained in its recent annual report that it intends to enhance its businesses through internal growth and &quot;perhaps, smaller strategic additions,&quot; but it hasn't precluded a major acquisition under the right circumstances.    Mr. Goldman said that in light of the payroll-trimming announcement, he increased his estimate of RJR Nabisco's 1988 per-share net income to $5.95 from $5.85. He has projected per-share net for the current year at $4.95. In 1986, the company had a profit of $1.06 billion, or $3.83 a share, on sales of $16 billion. The profit included a $16 million loss from discontinued operations.    The pre-tax saving from the cutbacks in 1988 should be $60 million to $80 million, said Marc Cohen, a Sanford C. Bernstein andamp; Co. analyst, who expects the tobacco unit to trim managers as well.    According to Mr. Cohen, Robert J. Carbonell, RJR Nabisco's senior executive vice president, told a group of portfolio managers at a meeting at Sanford Bernstein yesterday that the cutbacks have been accounted for as part of restructuring charges.    The move further reflects the determination of F. Ross Johnson, who became RJR Nabisco's chief executive officer in January, to run a leaner and less paternalistic company. Under Mr. Johnson, who is also president, the company has decided to move the corporate headquarters to Atlanta in September and to reduce the 1,000-member corporate staff to about 250 to 300 employees. </TEXT></DOC>
