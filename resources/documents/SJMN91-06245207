The airmen and their four-engine turbopropshave marked the South Bay horizon and buzzed the Bayshore Freeway for nearly30 years, since most of us have lived here. But in five years, these hunterswill leave for other skies.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Local  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  AIRBORNE WITH MOFFETT'S PROUD BIRDSDAYS ARE NUMBERED FOR SUB-HUNTING ORIONS  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     The government decision this summer to close Santa Clara County's58-year-old naval air station wasn't even the year's worst news. In March, twoMoffett P-3 Orions collided off the San Diego coast, leaving 27 lost at sea.;  Other large and small indignities:;   Just over a year ago, the Pentagoncanceled what was to have been Moffett's newest toy, the Lockheed P-7, thenext generation of the P-3. Last September, a senior Moffett pilot totaled anOrion in the Central  Valley on a short-field landing he was not qualified tofly, according to an internal Navy report.;   In December, a man broke throughthe front gate, took a hostage and approached the control tower threateningPresident Bush before he was arrested. In the spring, two of Moffett's sevenactive P-3 squadrons were disbanded.;   And this summer, the Moffett air show,an annual festival of derring-do, was canceled.;   Hunting submarines; Butthis morning, in this Orion, it seemed these 10 naval aviators had made peacewith the year behind them and reveled in the task at hand: &quot;Prosecuting atarget,&quot; they would say. Hunting submarines, we would say.;   Our hunteraccelerated over about 4,000 feet of concrete, less than half the runway, andlifted off toward the northwest. It glided over mud flats and the bay andturned sharply left before the Dumbarton Bridge, angling toward a beacon inthe San Mateo County hills. The cockpit surveyed the dense woods of Athertonand Woodside and the red-tile rooftops of Stanford University.;   The P-3'sroots are a late-1950s commercial model, the Lockheed Electra. Instead ofpassenger seats, it has 1980s military hardware inside, soon to be updated forthe '90s with Boeing electronics.;   Alaska or Hawaii; One hundred sixteenfeet from nose to tail, the P-3 can cruise the seas for up to 16 hours atmoderate speed. It can reach Adak, Alaska, midway through the Aleutian tail,in about seven hours. It can reach Barber's Point, Hawaii, in about six. Everyday, P-3s from those two islands and Moffett Field patrol vast stretches ofthe eastern and northern Pacific.;   On this day, we flew about 230 mph,passing between Half Moon Bay and Santa Cruz, arriving at our cloud-coveredtraining zone in less than 15 minutes. The area stretched south of Santa Cruzto San Simeon, near the spot off Point Sur where the Moffett dirigible USSMacon went down in 1935.;   The Orion was not built for dogfights, but it canbank a hard 60 or 70 degrees, gravity yanking the innards of an unsuspectingguest down to the ankles, while a smiling Navy host stands nearby with a cupof coffee.;   Inside the plane, a narrow aisle leads aft from the cockpit totactical stations to a kitchenette and a pair of bunks, where pilots sleep onlong missions.;   Outside the plane, two features stick out: a 48-tubehoneycomb on its belly, and a 20-foot-long black stinger on its tail.;   Thelatter is called a &quot;MAD boom.&quot; The powerful Magnetic Anomaly Detectorpinpoints ferrous metal objects in the water. The honeycomb stores cylindricalsonobuoys, the ears of the crew and the real business of this beast.;  Eavesdropping on the ocean; Hydrophones dropped into the water with aparachute, sonobuoys float and eavesdrop on the ocean. Or rather, they helpmen like Len Williams eavesdrop.;   If you're familiar with Clancy's &quot;The Huntfor Red October,&quot; which has a cult following in the Navy, you know the stout,bespectacled Petty Officer 2nd Class Williams as &quot;Jonesy,&quot; the sonar wizard.;  Williams, 28, of San Jose, is paid to hear the music of the ocean. Sometimesit is melodic, sometimes cacophonous. Dolphins click. Snapping shrimp snap:&quot;Incredibly loud, almost so loud it hurts your ears,&quot; Williams said. Sometimesunnatural sounds invade the concert.;   Williams is relaxed today. The enemyis imaginary. His plane carries no mines, missiles or torpedoes, only a fewunused sonobuoys.;   &quot;Sometimes it can get very irritating listening to thebuoys,&quot; he said. &quot;You know how you can overdrive speakers on a stereo? It doesthe same thing.&quot;;   Uncertain future; Williams has a year left in the Navy andis weighing an enlistment extension. His future is uncertain. The Navy willpull out of Moffett in stages over five years, dispersing its squadrons tobases in Hawaii, Maine, Florida or elsewhere.;   For now, Williams remains aGrey Knight, a member of Moffett's crack Patrol Squadron 46. The squadron'seight planes just passed 200,000 flying hours without mishap -- a Moffettsafety record, the crew boasts.;   Ask any of the Knights about the Marchcollision, and you'll get the same response. Pursed lips. A buddy remembered.No speculation on the cause. &quot;Death is part of our business,&quot; one officerexplained.;   Like other freak events at Moffett in the past year, the crashsobered these airmen.;   &quot;I don't want to say we were complacent,&quot; Williamssaid. &quot;But we were much more relaxed. Now, it sticks in the back of everyone'shead. Safety is paramount.&quot;;   Another issue that weighs on the crew is itsmission. The Cold War is over, the Soviet Union is disintegrating and the RedThreat apparently lingers only in pulp thrillers. Is the P-3 a Cold Warrelic?;   &quot;I'm asked that pretty often,&quot; said Lt. Cmdr. Steve Briganti, 34, ofAlameda, the mission commander. &quot; 'Why are you doing what you're doing? Arethere really subs out there?' &quot;;   &quot;What we're doing is the real thing. It'snot maneuvers. It's not exercises. We're here doing a front-line job.&quot;;   Weturn back to Moffett after a casual three-hour flight. The giant Libby'sfruit-can water tower to the left confirms we're back in Silicon Valley. Theplane skims over the freeway at a 3-degree incline, seeming to scalp trafficfrom 75 feet in the air, and lands.;   Our Orion taxis behind Hangar 3 andjoins many others sunning this afternoon in long rows on the tarmac. We willremember this sight when these birds leave their roost for good.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  NICK ANDERSON, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Peninsula/Am  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910901  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  1,227  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday, September 1, 199100245207,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  0  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
