Field of the Invention </PAR><PAR>  The present invention relates to electrohydraulic instruments and, more      particularly, to a probe for use with a lithotriptoscope and a method of      making the same. </PAR><PAR>  2. Prior Art </PAR><PAR>  Electrohydraulic instruments can generally be described as instruments that      produce hydraulic shock waves through electrical discharges in a liquid      dielectric medium. The production of shock waves by means of      electrohydraulics has been put to use in lithotriptic probes for the      destruction of vesical calculi or stones in the bladder, ureter and      kidneys. Various different means for the treatment of stones can be found      in the following U.S. Patents; U.S. Pat. No. 3,785,382 by Schmidt-Kloiber      et al; U.S. Pat. No. 3,543,757 by Baler et al; U.S. Pat. No. 4,027,674 by      Tessler et al; U.S. Pat. No. 3,792,701 by Kloz et al; U.S. Pat. No.      3,823,717 by Pohlman et al; U.S. Pat. No. 3,830,240 by Antonevich et al.      and U.S. Pat. No. 3,413,976 by Roze. </PAR><PAR>  The distal tips of electrohydraulic lithotripsy probes have generally taken      two types of configurations; two electrodes arranged side-by-side or an      inner electrode surrounded by an outer coaxial electrode. In both      configurations, one electrode would discharge an electric current to the      other electrode in the form of a flashover or dielectric breakdown through      the dielectric liquid. The strength of the shockwave is generally directly      proportional to the distance between the two electrodes. The greater the      distance between electrodes, the greater the voltage needed to cause the      breakdown of the dielectric liquid and thus, the stronger the resulting      shockwave at breakdown. </PAR><PAR>  However, problems exist with the probes used in the prior art. In      particular, in the manufacture of probes having the inner and outer      electrode configuration, it has not been possible to manufacture the two      electrodes with an equispaced distance therebetween that is maintained      throughout the entire work life of the probe. In the probes of the prior      art, the dielectric material between the inner and outer electrodes is      merely the outer covering of the inner electrode. Ordinarily, the inner      electrode is a conductive wire with a soft and flexible insulation cover      typical of an electrical wire. Because of the high temperatures and      pressures generated at the probe distal tip, during operation of the      probe, the dielectric material separating the two electrodes softens      resulting in movement between the two electrodes. Failure to provide and      maintain an equal distance between the inner electrode and outer electrode      results in the flashover occurring along a predominate path, the shortest      distance between the electrodes, rather than the desired multiple various      flashover paths. The resulting predominate flashover path causes premature      inner dielectric breakdown and eventual failure along the flashover line,      thus causing pitting and burning at a single area. on the outer electrode      reducing the working life of the probe. This reduction in the working life      of the probe is typically due to two types of failures. First, the inner      dielectric can experience breakdown due to more frequent flashovers about      a specific point or area. These frequent concentrated flashovers form a      more conductive line that allow flashovers to occur at increasingly low      voltages. This results in greatly reducing the effectiveness of the      shock-wave. Second, the concentrated flashovers caused by the non-centered      electrodes can result in the inner dielectric experiencing actual      mechanical failure such as a fracture or split of the inner dielectric      material proximate the flashover line. This generally allows the inner      electrode to move relative to the outer electrode decreasing the spacing      between the electrodes. This decrease in spacing reduces the strength of      resulting shockwaves and can eventually result in the two electrodes      coming into contact and causing an electrical short with a resulting total      failure of the probe. </PAR><PAR>  It is an objective of the present invention to provide a probe for use with      an electrohydraulic device that will have a substantially longer worklife      than prior art probes. </PAR><PAR>  It is a further objective of the present invention to provide a probe with      an inner electrode and an outer electrode that can maintain an equispaced      distance therebetween for the entire work life of the probe. </PAR><PAR>  It is a further objective of the present invention to provide a quick and      accurate method for producing probes with an inner electrode and outer      equispaced electrode. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The foregoing problems are overcome and other advantages are provided by a      probe for electrohydraulically impacting objects having at least two      electrodes and a relatively rigid dielectric spacer therebetween. </PAR><PAR>  In accordance with one embodiment of the invention a probe is provided      comprising a first electrode means; a second electrode means spatially      disposed relative to the first electrode means at a distal tip of the      probe with a relatively constant distance therebetween and forming      multiple electrical jumpways therebetween; and a spacer means disposed      between the first and second electrode means. The spacer means comprises a      relatively rigid dielectric material such that the first and second      electrode means are positioned and maintained at a relatively precise and      constant distance therebetween whereby the jumpways are substantially      similar to prevent a jumpway from being predominantly used over other      jumpways. </PAR><PAR>  In accordance with another embodiment of the invention an electrohydraulic      lithotriptoscope is provided with a probe having a distal working end. The      distal working end comprises an inner electrode, a spacer means fixedly      connected to the inner electrode and an outer electrode. The spacer means      comprises a first tube member comprised of a rigid dielectric material      having at least a portion of the inner electrode disposed therein and      forming an outer perimeter equispaced from the inner electrode. The outer      electrode comprises a second tube member having at least a portion of its      inner diameter proximate the spacer means outer perimeter whereby the      spacer means provides a rigid insulative barrier between the inner and      outer electrodes while maintaining a constant separative distance      therebetween proximate the distal end. </PAR><PAR>  In accordance with one method of the invention a method is provided for      manufacturing a electrohydraulic probe for use with a lithotriptic      instrument comprising the steps of connecting a distal end spacer means      with a first electrode and connecting a second electrode with the spacer      means. The spacer means has a central aperture therein with a relatively      constant thickness between the central aperture and an outer perimeter of      the spacer means at the distal end of the probe. The spacer means is      comprised of a rigid dielectric material and is in contact with the first      electrode about its outer perimeter. The second electrode is disposed in      the central aperture of the spacer means such that the second electrode is      rigidly equispaced from the first electrode at the distal end of the probe     . </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  The foregoing aspects and other features of the invention are explained in      the following description, taken in connection with the accompanying      drawings wherein: </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a diagrammatical view of an inspection instrument for      electrohydraulically impacting objects in use in the ureter of a patient. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is a cross-sectional view of a probe incorporating features of the      invention. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is an exploded view of the distal end of the probe shown in FIG. 2. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 is a plane end view of the probe tip taken along lines 4--4 of FIG.      2. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 5 is a cross-sectional view of the shaft section of the probe taken      along lines 5--5 of FIG. 2. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  Referring to FIG. 1 there is shown a diagrammatical view of the bladder 2,      ureter 4 and kidney 6 areas of a patient having a lithotriptoscope 8      moving therein. Although the following description is being given with      reference to a lithotriptoscope, it is to be understood that the present      invention can be used with any suitable type of instrument. The      lithotriptoscope 8 is generally provided for accessing the ureter area of      a patient for the destruction of vesical calculus 7. The lithotriptoscope,      in this embodiment, has a probe 10 which uses electrohydraulics to impact      the calculus 7 and for this purpose has a voltage source or generator 9      connected thereto. The probe 10, in this embodiment, passes through a      working channel (not shown) of the lithotriptoscope 8 and has a distal      working end 14 (see FIG. 2) that is extendable from an aperture (not      shown) at the distal end of the lithotriptoscope 8. </PAR><PAR>  Referring now also to FIG. 2, a cross-sectional view of the probe 10      incorporating features of the invention is shown. The probe 10, in this      embodiment, is connectable to the voltage source 9 via a coaxially      connector in a body section 12 of the probe 10. In an alternative      embodiment, the probe 10 may be integrally formed with the      lithotriptoscope. The probe 10, in this embodiment, generally Comprises a      body section 12, a shaft section 13 and a distal end 14. The shaft section      13, in this embodiment, generally comprises two conductors comprised of an      outer sheath 28 and an inner wire 38. The outer sheath 28 is generally      concentrically disposed relative to the inner wire 38. Located between the      two conductors 28 and 38 are a cover 48 of dielectric material and a      stiffener 49 made of any suitable material. The stiffener 49 provides a      stiffness to the shaft section 13. An exterior coating 50 is provided      around the sheath 28 to protectively insulate the sheath 28 as well as the      patient. The inner conductor 38 may be made of any suitable material such      as copper and is preferably provided as a solid wire. The dielectric      material 48 between the inner conductor 38 and the outer conductor 28 may      also be made of any suitable material. Preferably, the dielectric material      48 is resistant to chemical solvents and has a high dielectric strength,      such as a polyimide resin. Preferably, the inner conductor 38 and the      dielectric material 48 are provided as a unitary member with the      dielectric material 48 acting as a protective insulative cover for the      inner conductor 38. The outer conductor 28 can generally be described as a      tube shaped member. Preferably, the outer conductor 28 is comprised of a      wire braid sheath. </PAR><PAR>  The body section 12 is generally comprised of an inner connector 16, an      outer connector 18, an insulation barrier 20 therebetween and a second      outer connector 22. A portion of the shaft section 13 passes through a      central aperture 24 in the second outer connector 22. Inside the body      section 12, the inner conductor 38 and the outer sheath 28 are separated.      A portion of the insulation 48 covering inner conductor 38 is stripped      therefrom and the inner conductor is fixedly and electrically connected to      the inner connector 16. The wire braid sheath 28 passes into a chamber      formed between the first outer connector 18 and the second outer connector      22 and makes an electrical contact therewith as well as being relatively      fixedly held therein. </PAR><PAR>  Referring now also to FIG. 3, an exploded view of the distal end 14 of the      probe 10 is shown. The distal end of the probe 10 generally comprises the      first electrode 30 which is electrically connected to the outer sheath 28,      a spacer 36 and the inner conductor 38 which forms a second electrode. The      first or outer electrode 30 is generally comprised of a metallic material      and has an internal passage 32 therethrough. Located at the tip of the      first electrode 30 is an enlarged area of the passage 32 forming an      internal seat 34. The exterior of the electrode 30, in this embodiment, is      generally circular in cross section having three different outer diameters      which narrow in size from the tip. The seat 34 is also generally circular      in cross section such that the second electrode 30 forms a ring shape at      the distal tip as shown in FIG. 4. </PAR><PAR>  The spacer 36 is generally comprised of a dielectric material capable of      preventing electrical current flow through the spacer between the first      electrode 30 and the inner conductor or second electrode 38. The spacer      36, in this embodiment, is generally a tube shaped member having an outer      diameter slightly larger than the diameter of the seat 34. The spacer 36      also has a central aperture 40 to allow for passage of the inner conductor      38 therethrough. The size of the central aperture 40 is slightly larger      than the size of the inner conductor 38, but slightly smaller than the      size of the inner conductor 38 with the dielectric material or cover 48      therearound. In this embodiment, the spacer is comprised of a rigid or      semi-rigid material such as VESPEL, a trademark of E.I. Dupont      Corporation, a polyimide resin. However, any suitable relatively rigid      dielectric material that can withstand high temperatures and pressures can      be used. The thickness of the spacer 36 between the central aperture 40      and its outer diameter is relatively constant such that the spacing      between the inner conductor 38 and the outer electrode 30 is substantially      identical and uniform around the entire tip. Because the spacer 36 is made      of a relatively rigid material, the probe 10 can be manufactured such that      the distance between the inner conductor 38 and the outer electrode 30 is      relatively precise and accurate to allow for a uniform equispaced distance      between the two electrodes such as by machining the central aperture 40      concentric relative to the outer diameter. </PAR><PAR>  The assembly of the distal end 14 of the probe 10 generally comprises the      following steps. The spacer 36 is placed adjacent the distal tip of the      first electrode 30 and aligned therewith. Because the spacer 36 has an      outer diameter slightly larger than the inner diameter of the seat 34 of      the first electrode 30, a predetermined force is applied to the spacer 36      and first electrode 30 to press fit the spacer 36 into the seat 34      slightly compacting or compressing the spacer therein. The spacer 36, due      to its compression, is relatively fixedly held in the seat 34. In an      alternative embodiment, the spacer 36 and seat 34 may be provided with      cooperating threads such that the spacer 36 can be screwed into the seat      34. However, any suitable fixation means can be used. A portion of the      stiffener 49 is removed from the distal end of the stiffener 49 such that      when finally assembly, the stiffener 49 will not be located in the central      aperture 40 of the spacer 36 or interfere with the passage of the inner      conductor 38 or cover 48 through the central aperture 40 as will be      evident from the description below. A portion of the dielectric cover 48      surrounding the first conductor 38 is stripped from the distal end of the      conductor. The distal end of the conductor 38 having its insulation      removed can now be passed through the inner passage 32 of the outer      elements 30 and through the central aperture 40 in the spacer 36. As the      inner conductor 38 passes through the central aperture 40 the dielectric      cover 48 surrounding the inner conductor 38 eventually comes into contact      with the spacer 36 and because of the larger diameter of the cover 48      surrounding the inner conductor relative to the central aperture 40, the      dielectric material of the cover 48 prevents the inner conductor 38 from      being further advanced without additional force. At this point, additional      force is provided to advance the spacer along the inner conductor 38 with      the insulation material of the cover 48 being compressed or wedged within      the central aperture 40 of the spacer 36. The inner conductor 38 and cover      48 are advanced a predetermined distance until at least a portion of the      cover 48 of the inner conductor 38 passes completely through the central      aperture 40. The stiffener 49, having its distal end previously trimmed a      predetermined distance, does not interfere with the passage of the inner      conductor 38 and cover 48 through the spacer 36. The inner conductor 38      and its insulation cover 48 are trimmed from a first end of the spacer 36      which will form the distal tip of the probe 10. The inner conductor 38 is      fixedly held inside the central aperture 40 of the spacer due to the      compacted nature of its cover 48 therein. Thus, the distal end of the      probe 10 can be assembled without the use of additional fixation means.      The wire braid or sheath 28 is electrically connected to the outer      electrode 30. Thus manufactured, the inner connector 16 in the body      section 12 is electrically connected to the inner conductor 38 which forms      the second electrode at the distal tip and the outer connector 18 in the      body section 12 is also electrically connected to the first electrode 30      at the distal tip whereby a voltage applied to the inner connector 16 can      travel to the distal tip of the inner conductor 38 and jump across the      spacer 36 at the distal tip to the outer electrode 30 which allows the      voltage to travel back to the outer connector 18 and back into the voltage      source 9. </PAR><PAR>  Referring now also to FIG. 4, a plane view of the distal tip of the probe      10 is shown. As shown, the distal tip of the probe 10 generally appears to      have a bulls-eye type shape. The inner conductor 38 forms the center of      the bulls-eye surrounded by its protected insulation cover 48. Coaxially      mounted with the inner conductor 38 is the spacer 36. Coaxially      surrounding the spacer 36 is the first electrode 30. By the use of a rigid      or semi-rigid material in manufacturing of the spacer 36 the inner      conductor 38 which forms the second electrode is equispaced from the first      electrode 30. When an electrical charge is sent through the second      conductor 38 it will seek the path of least resistance. The probe 10      provides the path of least resistance via the second electrode 30.      However, due to the fact that the second conductor 38 is relatively      equally spaced from the first electrode 30 the exact path or jumpway which      the current or flashover must take at the distal tip between the inner      conductor 38 and the first electrode 30 is unpredictable. Because these      pathways or jumpways are unpredictable, no single pathway or jumpway is      predominant. Therefore, the normal pitting or scoring of the first      electrode 30 due to the jumps or flashovers of electricity from the inner      electrode 38 to the outer electrode 30 is evenly distributed along the      entire tip of the outer electrode 30. The relatively rigid mature of the      spacer substantially prevents or reduces the rate of the breakdown of the      spacer dielectric material and mechanical failure as described above and      allows for a longer useful work life of the probe 10. </PAR><PAR>  It should be understood that the foregoing description is only illustrative      of the invention.
