During designparticular attention was paid to passive energy conservation measures.The field study is based on measurements in all 32 flats. An energy balancehas been drawn up for an average block for the year 1982 with the aidof the BKL (Building construction) method, the input data being basedon the measurements. The reduction in fabric losses from the flats dueto heating of the veranda has been estimated at 4 kWh/m/sup 2/ annually.This modest saving does not on its own justify the choice of providingthe flats with glazed verandas. If it is also taken into considerationthat the veranda construction and the glass in the veranda reduce insolationinto the flat, the effect of the contribution of the veranda to the energybalance is cut by about one half, i.e. ca 2 kWh/m/sup 2/ annually. Withan energy price of SEK 0.35/kWh, for a 4 room flat of ca 100 m/sup 2/floor area, this is equivalent to an annual saving of SEK 77. Duringdesign, the airtightness of the verandas and the possibilities of utilisingthe energy gains from insolation were overestimated. The contributiondue to heat from the occupants was underestimated. The design energyconsumption for space heating is in good agreement with that obtainedfrom an energy balance drawn up on the basis of the measurements, ca60 kWh/m/sup 2/ annually.</TEXT></DOC>
