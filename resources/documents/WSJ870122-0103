No doubt the rate hikes will prompt some customers to cancel their service. But Glendinning Associates, a Westport, Conn., marketing consulting firm, has concocted a promotion that may lessen the sting.    This spring, the company plans to test &quot;Free Cable TV Shopping Spree&quot; with the Southern California Cable Television Marketing Council. Along with their bills, subscribers in the Los Angeles area will receive booklets explaining how to trim their payments by mailing in proofs of purchase from grocery products. Three jars of Hellman's mayonnaise, for example, might shave $1 off the bill, while two bottles of Sure deodorant could save another $1.    &quot;Every month in the cable industry 2% to 4% of subscribers disconnect. We hope promotional tie-ins like this will increase the value of cable and help us retain more customers,&quot; says Tony Farwell, president of the Southern California cable council. What's in it for the advertisers? &quot;Cable gives marketers access to large families with above-average incomes,&quot; Mr. Farwell says. &quot;The kind of people who buy a lot of peanut butter and diapers.&quot;    THERE'S ALSO a greater chance that promotions will get attention if they arrive with a cable bill. While consumers often throw out junk mail without even opening it, they are sure to open bills and at least glance at the inserts.    Marketers have been advertising for some time on cable channels, but only recently have they begun experimenting with cable promotions. Last fall, Vision Cable in Alexandria, La., sent subscribers entry forms for an American Airlines vacation sweepstakes along with discount coupons good at the local pharmacy, paint store and pizza parlor. And several systems this year will offer two airline tickets for the price of one to people who order cable services.    So far, cable operators have found their most enthusiastic promotion partners in local and regional businesses. Many national advertisers are discouraged by the fragmented nature of the cable industry, fearing that for a big coupon mailing they will face the nightmare of negotiating with dozens of cable operators.    This winter, though, General Mills Inc. discovered a relatively easy way to stage a mass promotion using cable bills. It is mailing 25-cent coupons for Fruit Roll-Ups to 8.8 million homes through a tie-in with MTV Networks' Nickelodeon channel. The coupon is attached to a bill stuffer publicizing &quot;Dangermouse&quot; and four other children's programs. &quot;Nickelodeon is a good fit because households with kids are the target for our fruit snacks,&quot; says Dave Murphy, general manager of marketing services at General Mills. &quot;But the jury is still out on whether this is cost effective.&quot;    ---   SINCE 1953, Johnson andamp; Johnson has been synonymous with baby shampoo. Except for store brands, its classic &quot;no more tears&quot; formula encountered little competition. But this year Johnson may be in a lather as two other companies enter the kids' market.    Next week, cosmetics giant Revlon Inc. will venture into baby products for the first time with Care for Kids mousse baby shampoo. Also challenging Johnson is DeVere Corp. of Columbia City, Ind. It is pushing Shampoo Creayted for Kids, which comes in bottles shaped like big crayons. President Dick Babcock notes that marketers &quot;have virtually ignored three to 10-year-old kids even though there are 28 million of them running around.&quot; Indeed, A.C. Nielsen Co. market researchers don't even track children's shampoos; they do, however, follow the $80 million-a-year baby shampoo business.    Johnson, meantime, hasn't been sitting by idly. It recently developed two line extensions -- a baby conditioner and conditioning formula shampoo -- to appeal to older children. Why the big interest in kids' locks all of a sudden? It's mainly because the adult market is so saturated that companies are hunting for less-crowded niches.    ---   MAGAZINES ARE IN for more rivalry from mail-order catalogs as the line between them blurs. In 1985, some catalogs began taking paid ads for such products as liquor and cologne. Now catalogs threaten to steal display space from magazines. Next month, 1,000 Waldenbooks stores will add a rack of catalogs selling for $1 to $3 apiece. By year end, Catalog Retail Corp., the national distributor, expects over 5,000 stores and newsstands to stock catalogs for such companies as Talbot's, Sharper Image and Bloomingdale's.    Because the average catalog offers retailers twice the profit margin of the average magazine, specialty magazines could be displaced, says Jay Walker, chairman of Catalog Retail. Paying for a book of ads may sound preposterous, but there's a $5 discount on the first order, more than offsetting the catalog price.    ---   TALK ABOUT TARGET MARKETING. A Cleveland man this spring plans to launch a health and personal finance magazine called Bathroom Journal in hopes of attracting advertisers of toiletries, pharmaceuticals and bathroom fixtures. Says Publisher Michael Cohen: &quot;We've combined the convenience of an in-flight passenger magazine with the coffee-table permanence of Architectural Digest.&quot; Readers, he contends, are in just the right frame of mind for certain pitches while they're in the bathroom contemplating their personal appearance. But Mr. Cohen has yet to lure major advertisers like Colgate-Palmolive Co. Instead, ads in the first test issue feature such mail-order items as bathrobes and tile grout. </TEXT></DOC>
