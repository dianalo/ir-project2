Emery, a Wilton, Conn.-based air cargo transportation company, said the offer for 6.3 million shares, valued at $252 million, is its first step in a plan to acquire all of Purolator, a package delivery and auto-parts concern. Emery said that upon completion of the offer, it would propose to swap each remaining share for $40 face amount of 13% subordinated debentures. The total transaction has an indicated value of $306 million.    The offer tops an earlier leveraged buyout proposal of $35 a share by PC Acquisitions Inc., which is owned by eight Purolator executives and E.F. Hutton LBO Inc., a subsidiary of E.F. Hutton Group Inc.    That offer, which began Feb. 28 and is scheduled to expire at 12:01 a.m. EST Thursday, is structured in a similar way. PC Acquisition offered $35 a share in cash for 83% of the shares, and a combination of cash and securities for the remaining 17%. The value of that offer, which was accepted by Purolator's board, is about $268 million.    Emery officials said they sent a letter announcing the offer to Nicholas F. Brady, Purolator's chairman, at his office in New York and at Purolator's headquarters in Basking Ridge, N.J. The letter was signed by John C. Emery, chairman of the company.    The Emery officials said they had received no response from Mr. Brady. Richard Ball, vice president and treasurer of Emery, said Emery had &quot;no indication either way&quot; of what Mr. Brady's response would be. The officials said they had had no previous conversations with Mr. Brady concerning an offer.    Mr. Brady was said to be traveling last night. Other Purolator officials couldn't be reached for comment.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Purolator shares closed at $34.875, down 62.5 cents, on volume of 266,900 shares. Emery shares closed at $12.625, up 50 cents. The offer was announced after the market closed.    After the PC Acquisitions offer was made, Purolator said one of its directors, Dorsey R. Gardner, resigned to seek rival bids for the company. According to Purolator, Mr. Gardner said he believed &quot;shareholder values could be enhanced if one or more industrial purchasers could be induced to bid for all or portions of the business.&quot;    Emery's Mr. Ball said Mr. Dorsey didn't solicit his company's offer, and that Emery has been considering an offer for Purolator for the &quot;last few weeks.&quot;    In the letter to Purolator's Mr. Brady, Emery said it believed the two companies would &quot;provide an excellent fit&quot; and that &quot;the combination will enable each of us to better serve our existing customers.&quot;    The Emery offer expires at 12:01 a.m. EDT April 29, unless extended. Emery said it received financing commitments from Chemical Bank, a unit of Chemical New York Corp.; Bankers Trust Co., a unit of Bankers Trust New York Corp.; Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. of New York, and Salomon Brothers Holding Co., a unit of Salomon Inc.    As previously reported, a shareholder group asked a New York state court on Monday to block the leveraged buyout. An affidavit in support of the plaintiffs said that Interlink Express PLC, a Britain-based package courier, was &quot;in the process of formulating&quot; an all-cash bid &quot;at a price substantially higher&quot; than the proposed leverage buyout. The affidavit was filed by Jules Lederer, who is identified in the affidavit as chairman of Francorp., a consultant to Interlink.    Yesterday the plaintiffs withdrew the affidavit amid reports that Interlink had denied that it was planning to make an offer. Interlink officials couldn't be reached for comment.    In the nine months ended Sept. 30, 1986, Purolator had a net loss of $35.9 million on revenue of $630.6 million. In 1986, Emery had a net loss of $5.4 million on revenue of $887.5 million.    In a leveraged buyout, a company is acquired largely with borrowed funds that are repaid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or through asset sales. </TEXT></DOC>
