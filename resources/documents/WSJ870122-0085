The new U.S. immigration law, signed by President Reagan Nov. 6, offers amnesty to illegal immigrants who had lived in the U.S. continuously since before Jan. 1, 1982. Illegal immigrants who arrived after that date are barred from working in the U.S. and face an increased threat of deportation.    Guatemalans and Salvadorans who don't qualify for immigration amnesty in the U.S. are safer in Canada, which for humanitarian reasons doesn't deport people back to the war zones and dictatorships of 18 countries -- including El Salvador and Guatemala. Many of these people also can qualify as refugees under Canadian law.    A Canadian immigration spokesman said that the busy Blackpool border crossing between New York state and Quebec has increased its staff 50% to 23 officers since the beginning of the year to handle the heavy influx, and that the station soon may double its staff. This week, the director's office was turned into a processing room to handle the applications of Central Americans seeking to stay in Canada.    The migration from the U.S. has the Canadian government concerned, and uncertain about what to do. As one option, it is considering replacing its list of 18 countries whose nationals can't be deported with a program that would consider each case on its own merits. &quot;We're following (the situation) closely. We won't react in a knee-jerk fashion,&quot; said Len Westerberg, a spokesman for Canadian immigration minister Gerald Weiner.    Canada would like Central Americans in the U.S. to continue to apply for immigrant visas at Canadian consulates in American cities. Last year, Canadian consulates in the U.S. granted more than 900 such visas to Guatemalans and Salvadorans. But that routine is stringent and can take as long as a year. Because of the new U.S. law, &quot;the impetus for them to get out (of the U.S.) is a lot stronger,&quot; said a Canadian immigration official.    Officials say that Mexicans aren't part of the current migration into Canada. But, in addition to the Salvadorans and Guatemalans, there's also a trickle to Canada from the U.S. of illegal nationals from Haiti, Honduras and Chile. Those three aren't on the list of 18 countries whose citizens are sheltered from deportation, but they do have recourse.    Under Canadian law, anyone who applies for refugee status is entitled to an oral hearing. Foreign nationals applying for refugee status must prove solely that they have a legitimate fear of persecution in their homeland, while those applying for immigrant status must meet several conditions involving more red tape, including having relatives in Canada or being prepared to open a business. And while those applying for refugee status are sometimes sent back to the U.S. until their hearing date, those applying for status as an immigrant must apply from outside Canada.    Canada's refugee policy, widely viewed as humanitarian, also is open to abuse. Mr. Westerberg said the U.S. government complained in the past &quot;that it's so darn easy to get into Canada, and once there, they can skip into the U.S. But we don't have exit controls, we're not a Communist block country. Once they cross the border, it's a U.S. problem.&quot;    For the same reasons, Mr. Westerberg doesn't expect the U.S. to change its domestic immigration laws to meet Canadian concerns. &quot;It's a two-way street,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
