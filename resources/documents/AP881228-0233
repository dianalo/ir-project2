The rescue packages involved American Savings and LoanAssociation of Stockton, Calif., the nation's second-largest Sandamp;L andthe biggest one that is classified as insolvent, and a group of fiveof the most troubled Sandamp;Ls in Texas.   The Texas Sandamp;Ls were being taken over by the investment group ofMacAndrews andamp; Forbes Holding Inc., which is led by Ronald O.Perelman, the takeover specialist who is head of the Revloncosmetics firm.   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulates the nation's3,000 Sandamp;Ls, agreed to provide $5.1 billion in government assistanceover the next 10 years. In return, the Perelman group agreed tocontribute $315 million of its own funds to buy the five Texas Sandamp;Ls.   The latest Texas package represented the second largest amount ofgovernment aid ever extended. It was exceeded only by $5.5 billionin assistance provided in the merger of Sunbelt Savings Associationand seven other Texas institutions last August.   In the other billion-dollar-plus transaction announced Wednesday,the bank board pledged to provide an estimated $1.7 billion ingovernment assistance over the next three years in the sale ofAmerican Savings to a group headed by Texas billionaire Robert M.Bass.   The Bass group will put up $350 million in cash and add $150million over the next three years.   The three-member bank board met late into the night Wednesday asthe agency raced the clock to finish as many deals as possiblebefore Jan. 1 when the tax breaks to the purchasers of insolventSandamp;Ls are reduced.   In other actions Wednesday the bank board said it was providing:   _ $4.9 million in government assistance in the the takeover ofthe insolvent First Federal Savings and Loan Association ofColumbus, Ga., by Barnett Banks Inc. of Jacksonville, Fla. The bankwill invest $31.5 million and operate the Sandamp;L as Barnett FederalSavings Bank.   _ $66.4 million in government assistance in the takeover of theinsolvent McLean Federal Savings and Loan of Virginia by NVRyanL.P., a home construction company, which will invest $16 million toacquire the Sandamp;L. The new institution will operate as NVR FederalSavings Bank.   _ $59.6 million in government assistance in the takeover of theinsolvent First Financial Savings Bank of Des Moines, Iowa, byMetropolitan Federal Bank of Iowa, which will operate FirstFinancial's 10 offices as branches of Metropolitan Federal.   The latest transactions Wednesday brought to 184 the number offailed Sandamp;Ls with which the bank board has dealt this year, up from48 last year. Seventy of the institutions have been in Texas, wherefinancial institutions have suffered because of hard times in theoil and real estate industries.   So far this year, the bank board has pledged in excess of $30billion in government assistance, with an expectation of severalmore bailout packages before Sunday when the new year begins.   Bank Board Chairman M. Danny Wall said regulators were working tocomplete other deals and it was likely the final total for the yearcould reach 200.   The board is rushing to complete transactions because tax breaksfor the investors getting government assistance will be cut in halfafter Jan. 1.   Private analysts said the size of the latest rescue packagesserved to highlight just how serious a problem is facing the newBush administration.   ``The Sandamp;L situation is a disaster and it is not going to getbetter in a hurry,'' said David Wyss, chief financial economist forData Resources Inc., a Lexington, Mass. consulting firm. ``This is aproblem that President Bush would be well advised to address fairlyearly.''   Even with the post-Depression record number of cases beinghandled this year, more than 400 insolvent Sandamp;Ls remain open andhundreds of others are close to insolvency.   Estimates of cleaning up the industry range from a low of $50billion, the current bank board projection, to a high of $112billion included in the latest report from the General AccountingOffice, the auditing arm of Congress.   Analysts said the problem is getting worse by $1 billion a month,putting even more pressure on the new administration to come up withmore government aid so that the sick Sandamp;Ls can be dealt with morequickly, thus easing the final taxpayer tab.   So far the government assistance has come primarily from specialassessments healthy Sandamp;Ls are required to pay to the federal agencythat insures individual deposits up to $100,000.   However, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., which isan arm of the bank board, is itself technically insolvent, with itsobligations to close or merge sick Sandamp;Ls far outweighing the revenuestream expected from industry fees.   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, who will be staying on in theBush administration, has ordered a study of ways to replenish theFSLIC fund. He reportedly is searching for a plan that will minizethe impact on the federal budget deficit. FSLIC expenditures countas federal spending.   Thus the growing Sandamp;L problem is making Bush's campaign pledge totrim the budget deficit without resorting to new taxes moredifficult to meet.   Some in Congress have been critical of the bank board rescuepackages, charging that the deals fail to attract enough money fromthe investors taking over the failed Sandamp;Ls.   But Wall said Wednesday that the cost to the government of simplyclosing the insolvent institutions and paying off depositors up tothe $100,000 maximum provided by law would be far more costly.   In the case of the latest Texas rescue package, Wall put the costof closing the institutions and paying off depositors at $6.8billion, compared with the $5.1 billion projected government cost ofthe merger.   In the case of American Savings, Wall said the shut-down costwould have been $3.3 billion, almost double the $1.7 billion thegovernment expects to pay out in the sale to the Bass group.   The Texas institutions involved are First Texas SavingsAssociation and Montfort Federal Savings and Loan Association, bothin Dallas; Gibraltar Savings Association and Home Savings and LoanAssociation, both in Houston; and Killeen Savings and LoanAssociation, in Killeen.   Montfort is the former Vernon Savings and Loan Association ofDallas, which got into trouble for risky lending practices. When thebank board took over the institution earlier this year, officialsfound that 96 percent of its loans were deliquent or non-performing.   The former offices of the five Sandamp;Ls opened Wednesday as branchesof First Texas Bank FSB with no interruption in service todepositors.</TEXT></DOC>
