The operation of a thermal power plant is composed of numerousunit operations, and is carried out by estimation, practice, and evaluationof the results, which procedures are repeated. An expert system has beendeveloped, which makes available a data base of expert knowledge of theskilled operators composed of sets of the unit operations and makes thecomputers to execute the operation. An automation system to which theexpert system is applied has been prepared. As a result, the thermalpower station is operated according to a man-machine system by a feweroperators. Recently, the all digital control system employed has furtherimproved the management performance, the operation, and the maintenanceof the thermal power station. For the combined cycles, the numerous unitsare supervisory-controlled to make appropriate the start and stoppingof each unit and enhance the efficiency. For the future technologies,a dispersed control system using microcomputers, and standardizationof high speed data transmission are under developement or progress. Also,an operation supporting system by which the operation of the power stationwith high safety, high control performance and efficiency, by a feweroperators is supported, and a maintenance supporting system for standardmaintenance tools, detection of abnormalities, and diagnosis of the equipmentare under development.
