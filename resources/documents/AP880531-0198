(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Republicans working Tuesday on theirparty platform accused the Democrats of being less open than theGOP and of trying to hide liberal views of likely nominee MichaelDukakis.   GOP Chairman Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr. said of the Democrats,``They are simply not interested in writing an honest,straightforward platform that expresses their true plan forAmerica. The Republican approach is one of openness.''   Sen. Bob Kasten of Wisconsin said Republicans would force theDemocrats ``to take the field'' on critical issues and would``flush the Dukakis Democrats'' out, exposing what he said weretheir left-of-center views.   The seven-member committee met to discuss social issues in oneof four hearings it will hold before the national convention in NewOrleans.   Sen. Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas said in remarks to the committeethat the value of the platform should be restored by shortening itand not ``making it a catch-all and promise-all.''   Democratic Party Chairman Paul Kirk has made a similar requestconcerning his party's platform.   Kassebaum said, ``The one major difference between Republicansand Democrats is that government must have a limited role.''   Gov. Mike Hayden of Kansas urged the committee to include astrong rural plank in the platform.   ``Sometimes policies of the federal government havediscriminated against rural areas,'' Hayden said. ``We have heardabout urban renewal, but seldom have we heard about ruralrevitalization.''   The party's 1980 and 1984 platforms, the latter particularlypleasing to conservatives, will serve as a basis for the 1988platform, said Nebraska Gov. Kay Orr, chairman of the platformcommittee.   ``It's a good base,'' Mrs. Orr said of the 1984 platform. ``Buttimes have changed. There is a different emphasis that we willplace on things.''   Fahrenkopf said the 1984 platform ``established a base, a soul''for the party.   ``But times have changed, problems have changed,'' Fahrenkopfsaid at a news conference held by the seven committee membersduring a lunch break. ``We want to take conservative approaches tosolve the problems we see coming down the road.''   ``We have had no specific direction from Bush,'' Mrs. Orr said,referring to likely GOP presidential nominee George Bush. ``We willhave a line of communication open. We're very interested in thevice president's views.''   As for the party's November opponents, Fahrenkopf said, ``TheDemocrats face a level-with-America dilemma. Do they hide theliberal agenda and record of their nominee Michael Dukakis, or dothey level with Americans and detail their liberal goals andplans.''</TEXT></DOC>
