During a six-day visit to Tokyo that ended Tuesday, U.S. VicePresident Dan Quayle made space cooperation a top priority inforging a ``global partnership'' with Japan, beginning with theinternational ``Freedom'' space station and a project to measureeffects of solar radiation on Earth's magnetic field.   Quayle said both sides were considering possible Japanesecollaboration in a new U.S. initiative for space exploration thatwould put a permanent observatory on the moon and send a mannedmission to Mars.   Japanese leaders welcomed Quayle's enthusiastic support forinternational cooperation in space, a rare area in which Japan lagsfar behind the United States and Europe in terms of both technologyand spending.   Partly due to prohibitions imposed by the United States afterWorld War II, Japan is a latecomer to the aerospace field. It hasrelied heavily on foreign technology and, while active indevelopment of rockets and satellites, has no independent mannedspace program.   This summer, as the U.S. National Space Council, chaired byQuayle, began mapping out a new U.S. era in space, Japan wasdrafting a 10-year space program to develop an unmanned space planein the next decade and eventually to send its own astronauts intospace aboard Japanese-made spacecraft.   The program also calls for basic research on robots capable ofassembling and repairing satellites in orbit and for developing arocket capable of lifting commercial payloads into orbit.   Constitutional limits on Japan's military, which have sloweddefense-related research, and low government spending have beenmajor handicaps for Japan's space program.   Concerned that U.S. restrictions on security-sensitive andadvanced technology could close the technology pipeline, Japan hasbegun channeling more funds into space research, although spendingremains far below that of the United States.   In 1989, Japan is spending $1.1 billion on its space programs,compared with $9 billion dollars spent by the National Aeronauticsand Space Administration alone in 1988.   Without a substantial increase in commercial spinoffs frommilitary and other government-sponsored space research, Japan isunlikely, however, to develop a profitable, competitive spaceprogram in the foreseeable future, says Stephen E. Marvin, ananalyst at Jardine Fleming Securities Ltd. in Tokyo.   ``The Japanese space industry is tiny. In terms of actualpotential I don't see the emergence of an independent andcommercially viable aerospace industry anytime soon,'' Martin said.   Quayle said during his visit to the Tsukuba Space Center east ofTokyo that instead of fearing competition from Japan in space, theUnited States hoped Japan could help defray the huge cost of spaceexploration. He said U.S. charges that Japan is not buying enoughAmerican-made satellites should not interfere with overallcooperation in space science.   Japan faces possible retaliation under U.S. ``Super 301'' tradelegislation if it is judged to be unfairly discriminating againstthe U.S.-made satellites.   While Japan would like to have a strong space industry, it ismore likely to join international programs that dilute risk whilefacilitating technology transfers.   ``Japan wants to have its own indigenous technology, but therisks involved in space development are enormous,'' Martin said.   Aerospace could become Japan's only truly internationalindustry, says analyst Keith Donaldson of James Capel and Co.   ``In the past all (Japanese) manufacturing was originallydomestic, and that created trade problems,'' said Donaldson. TheMinistry of International Trade and Industry ``wants to useaerospace to internationalize Japan,'' he said.   To international projects, Japan can contribute superiorelectronics technology, particularly in radar and visual imaging aswell as the powerful computer chips needed in sophisticatedaerospace equipment, Martin said.   Japan is trying to develop its own industry for commerciallaunches of satellites, a step that requires upgrading oldtechnology borrowed from the United States to develop a rocket ableto launch heavier payloads. Its payloads for a geostationary orbitcurrently are limited to 1,200 pounds.   To be competitive, Japan must have a rocket capable of handlingat least 2,000 pounds. But Japanese researchers have run intotechnical problems that have delayed the launch of the nextgeneration H-2 rocket by at least one year, officials say.   Japan also needs to find another location for satellitelaunches, says Donaldson. Its equivalent of Cape Canaveral inFlorida is the Tanegashima Space Center on a small island off thesouthern coast.   The Tanegashima facility has been expanded to accommodate theH-2 rocket program, but an agreement with local fishermen restrictslaunches to a 45-day period in the summer and another 45-day periodin the winter, limiting both experimental progress and futurecommercial launches.</TEXT></DOC>
