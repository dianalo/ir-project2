Now the public knows that John Poindexter says the buck stopped with him; the committee presumably knew this since his secret testimony in May, but kept us in the dark until the cameras could roll.    It's everyone for him-or-herself in deciding whether to believe the Poindexter testimony that the president didn't know of the plan to give Iranian arms sale proceeds to the Contras. In a Washington Post-ABC News poll, 63% of respondents said President Reagan must have known.    In the same poll, 46% favored a pardon for Mr. Poindexter now, and another 8% if he is charged with a crime. (61% plus 5% for Oliver North.) Asked how much they would be bothered if Mr. Reagan had approved the Iran-Contra plan, respondents said: A great deal -- 32%, Somewhat -- 29%, Hardly at all -- 26% and Not at all -- 11%. </TEXT></DOC>
