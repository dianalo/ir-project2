Nikkei said Jan. 31 that its internal inquiry hadn'tturned up evidence of such a bribe and that it had asked theprosecutor's office, which hadn't disclosed any names, toidentify the alleged recipient.   The paper said that the prosecutor's office advised itcouldn't answer Nikkei's request, and that this had deepenedthe paper's belief no one received the cash.   In December at a trial involving former top Itomanexecutives, the prosecutor alleged the trading firm made thepayment through a collaborator in exchange for leakedinformation on the Itoman case from the Nikkei employee.Itoman faced collapse last year from speculative real estateand art investments that resulted in debt exceeding $7.89billion and charges of breach of trust against some of itsformer top officials.                                                                                                          EC NATIONS' JOBLESS DATA                                                                                                          Seasonally adjusted unemployment in the 12 EuropeanCommunity countries in December was 9.2%, unchanged fromNovember but up from 8.4% a year earlier.

HORSE-RACING COMEBACK IN CHINA?                                                                                                          More than four decades after China's horse racing trackswere closed, the sport is poised for a comeback. Guangdongprovince in southern China plans to build a track &quot;withChinese characteristics&quot; near Guangzhou, the provincialcapital. As gambling is illegal in China, local officials areemphasizing recreational and public welfare benefits, andthey intend to offer prizes such as color television setsrather than cash winnings. Betting profits could help financepublic projects, such as road and railway construction.Organizers hope to attract foreign fans, especially thosefrom Hong Kong.                                                                                                          BONN TACKLES INVESTMENT BARRIER                                                                                                          Bonn, in a bid to speed the pace of eastern Germany'seconomic upturn, intends to propose legislation that couldoverturn one of the barriers to investment in the region. Theplan calls for former owners of expropriated eastern Germanproperty to file claims within 14 days of its sale;thereafter, the new investor could claim title. Ownershipissues have bogged down efforts to attract investment toeastern Germany.                                                                                                          JAPAN LAUNCHES `GREEN' SATELLITE                                                                                                          Tokyo launched its first environmental survey satellite.The Japan Earth Resources Satellite-1 will observe weatherpatterns and changes in the Earth's surface, such asdestruction of the Amazon rain forest. The satellite is toorbit for two years at an altitude of 353 miles.                                                                                                          MANILA CLEARS IMF HURDLE                                                                                                          An International Monetary Fund review group has approvedthe Philippines' economic performance, clearing the way forthe restructuring of more than $5 billion in commercial-bankdebt.   The move, based on deficit-containment measures, alsopermits Manila to reschedule more than $400 million inlow-interest government-to-government loans that come duethis year.   IMF board approval later this month would let thePhilippines proceed with already negotiated plans withcommercial lenders to revamp nearly all of the country'scommercial debt. Accomplishing this before the May elections,an IMF aide said, would allow the new administration to focuson domestic problems.   The IMF action also releases about $100 million of agencyfunding for the Philippines this year. The IMF is Manila'smost important creditor, because other lenders wait for theagency to work out terms for its funding before they extendtheir own money. The IMF last August suspended its lending toManila when it failed to meet economic targets.
