However, trading was fairly light aside from dividend-related activity in three utility stocks.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which advanced more than 27 points Friday, jumped another 20.88 to close at 2035.97, despite pulling back from session highs in late trading.    Among broader market averages, Standard andamp; Poor's 500-Stock Index gained 2.32 to 262.46 and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index rose 1.18 to 148.21. Some 939 issues advanced on the Big Board and 603 declined.    About 157 million shares changed hands on the Big Board, somewhat above Friday's volume of 152.5 million. However, yesterday's total was skewed by institutional activity designed to capture the next dividend payments of Southern Co., Cincinnati Gas andamp; Electric and Pinnacle West Capital. Those three issues accounted for 21.5% of the trading on the Big Board. Southern was the most active issue.    Otherwise, traders said, activity was subdued in advance of today's report on first-quarter gross national product.    The consensus estimate of economists polled by the Dow Jones Capital Markets Report is that GNP grew at a 2.2% annual rate in the quarter, well below the fourth-quarter rate of 4.8% but above earlier estimates.    Buying interest in blue-chip issues and a modest number of buy programs resulting from stock-index arbitrage were the primary factors in the market's gains, traders said.    Sidney Dorr, a vice president of trading at Robinson-Humphrey Co., Atlanta, said the market doesn't appear to be in a position to break out of the trading-range pattern that has prevailed during the past six months. &quot;The best we can hope for, still, is to extend the trading range upward,&quot; Mr. Dorr said.    Analysts said the latest gains reflect the better-than-expected first-quarter results posted by a number of major companies.    Since the flood of quarterly earnings reports began to pour into the market last week, index arbitrage and other program trading had largely offset investors' positive response to those results. In particular, the Dow industrials fell 8 points last Tuesday after much-improved results at several blue-chip firms had pushed the average sharply higher.    John D. Connally, chief investment strategist and chairman of the investment policy committee at Dean Witter Reynolds, said much of the impetus for the sell programs has come from the bond market, where prices have fallen lately in response to higher interest rates.    Mr. Connally is among several analysts who believe that the upturn in rates, which has pushed the yield on the Treasury's 30-year long bond to the 9% level, is coming to an end. To reflect his view, Dean Witter increased the recommended weighting of the interest-sensitive utilities sector in its model portfolio to 14% from 9%.    The recent rounds of weakness in bonds and sluggishness in stocks have resulted largely from &quot;a couple of numbers that just happened to bounce the wrong way,&quot; namely the March data on consumer and producer prices and the February trade deficit, he said.    &quot;The negatives have been overdone, and the numbers have been read poorly,&quot; Mr. Connally said. &quot;If that gets reversed, we'll have some opportunities here.&quot;    Harry Laubscher, a market strategist at Tucker Anthony andamp; R.L. Day, is less optimistic about the prospects for stocks. Buying interest in blue chips &quot;often occurs before an important correction as investors move back to safety,&quot; he said, and he doesn't expect this case to be any different.    &quot;So far in the second quarter, the market's been looking better than it really is,&quot; Mr. Laubscher said. &quot;We're telling people just to take advantage of any periods of strength to lighten up their positions.&quot;    Oil stocks generally firmed in response to reports of sharply higher first-quarter earnings at Exxon, which gained 3/4 to 44 3/4; Mobil, which added 1 3/8 to 47 1/4, and Amoco, which closed unchanged at 78 1/8. Among other oil issues, Chevron advanced 1 1/8 to 48 3/8 and Texaco rose 5/8 to 48 1/2.    General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler rose on reports that mid-April U.S. auto sales topped year-earlier levels and proved to be stronger than expected. GM climbed 1 1/4 to 74 5/8, Ford gained 1 1/4 to 47 1/8 and Chrysler added 1/2 to 23 3/4.    Goodyear Tire andamp; Rubber advanced 1/2 to 64 1/2. The company stands to benefit from GM's decision to drop Firestone Tire andamp; Rubber as a supplier for its North American vehicles within two years. Firestone dropped 1/8 to 79 1/2 as shareholders approved the company's acquisition by Bridgestone Corp. of Japan for $80 a share.    USG advanced 1 3/4 to 39 3/4. Desert Partners, which is offering to buy as many as 39 million of the company's shares for $42 each, said it received $1.9 billion in financing for its offer. The partnership also ended a requirement that the company's preferred stock-purchase rights be tendered along with the shares under the bid.    CPC International climbed 2 3/8 to 50 7/8 amid speculation that an unfriendly potential acquirer bought a block of 3.1 million shares, or about 4% of its common stock, that changed hands late Friday. Analysts suggested that Forstmann-Leff Associates or some other large shareholder may have sold the shares to other institutions. Forstmann-Leff, which at last report owned 7.5% of CPC, declined comment.    J.P. Stevens added 1/4 to 67 3/4 after accepting a revised takeover offer of $68.50 a share from West Point-Pepperell. In connection with the offer, certain Stevens assets will be sold for about $530 million to Odyssey Partners, Pepperell's former rival in a bidding war for the company. Pepperell fell 7/8 to 30 1/8.    Syntex, which said three studies of its Ticlopidine anti-stroke drug were &quot;promising,&quot; rose 1 to 36 1/8. The company said it expects to submit applications in early 1989 to federal regulatory agencies for approval of the drug.    EMC Corp. plunged 4 5/8 to 7 3/8. The company said late Friday it expects to post &quot;disappointing&quot; first-quarter net of three to four cents a share, down from 24 cents a share a year earlier and well below analysts' forecasts.    The American Stock Exchange Index gained 0.92 to 298.95. Superior Industries International, which said it is holding talks with an unidentified party about a possible business combination, jumped 3 1/4 to 19. The company said it has retained Drexel Burnham Lambert as an adviser in the discussions.    Cetec added 7/8 to 10 1/2. The company agreed to be acquired for $11 a share by Mark IV Industries, which gained 1/8 to 11 5/8 on the Big Board.    Datarex Systems climbed 3/4 to 16 1/2. The company agreed in principle to be acquired by Abitibi-Price for $17.875 a share, or about $41 million.    On the over-the-counter market, the Nasdaq OTC Composite Index rose 1.23 to 375.27. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by 1,106 to 912.    Farmers Group dropped 1 3/8 to 61 3/4. The company said it discontinued its talks about a possible leveraged buy-out, but reaffirmed its opposition to the $63-a-share takeover offer by B.A.T Industries.    Bear Automotive Services added 1 to 8 3/4, apparently because of speculation about a possible takeover. The company, which recently disclosed that it had &quot;preliminary discussions&quot; with a potential suitor, said there were no developments in the talks.    Windmere dropped 1 3/4 to 18. Barron's magazine reported that all of the company's $14 million in operating profit last year came from international revenue of $32 million. Its U.S. sales totaled $113.3 million. Separately, the company posted first-quarter net income of 57 cents a share, up from 18 cents a year earlier.    Graphic Scanning added 5/16 to 7 7/16. A group led by McCaw Cellular Communications said it holds a 6.13% stake in the company's common shares and expects to seek federal clearance to boost its holdings. McCaw's Class A shares rose 3/8 to 21 7/8.    Alpha 1 Biomedicals jumped 1 1/4 to 8 1/2. Viral Technologies, the company's joint venture with CEL-SCI Corp., received approval from the British government to begin human clinical trials on HGP-30, its prototype AIDS vaccine. CEL-SCI added 1/4 to 2 1/8 bid. </TEXT></DOC>
