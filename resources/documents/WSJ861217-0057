The probe is likely to focus on activity last Friday, when Texas Commerce stock rose $2.75 to close at $26.50 in heavy trading. About 461,000 shares changed hands.    SEC officials declined to comment. But a spokesman for the New York Stock Exchange confirmed that the exchange planned to review recent trading activity in the stock. The spokesman said: &quot;As a standard procedure, because of the activity, we will conduct an initial analysis into trading activity of Texas Commerce Bancshares. This analysis will look at several hours, several days, or several weeks of trading activity.&quot; The Big Board, together with other stock exchanges, makes its findings available to the SEC.    David A. Rich, vice president of the Pacific Stock Exchange in San Francisco, said that 4,200 Texas Commerce shares -- representing about 1% of all the shares traded Friday on the exchange -- changed hands in the half hour after trading closed in New York. Trading on the Big Board ends at 4 p.m. EST, while the Pacific exchange is open for trading until 4:30 p.m. EST. A total of 10,000 Texas Commerce shares were traded Friday on the Pacific exchange. The stock closed at $26.75 a share, 25 cents higher than the final price in New York.    A spokesman for Chemical New York, parent of Chemical Bank, said, &quot;We're unaware of any possible inquiry&quot; into possible insider trading. But he acknowledged that Chemical talked to Texas Commerce Friday about the sharp rise in the Houston company's stock price. The spokesman denied that Monday's announcement was prompted by the trading activity, saying it had been scheduled &quot;much earlier&quot; than Friday. He added that he is &quot;unaware&quot; of any internal investigation that might be under way at Chemical.    A Texas Commerce spokesman said, &quot;We're aware of reports of the investigation but don't know of anything that would lead us to think there was any illegal trading of our stock.&quot;    The stock prices of the major Texas bank holding companies have swung sharply since mid-summer, when the Texas legislature began considering a measure to allow out-of-state takeovers of Texas banks. The final legislation was enacted in September. In recent weeks, however, shares of companies other than Texas Commerce fell as interest in interstate takeovers seemed to wane. On Friday, Texas Commerce's stock had one of its sharpest price rises and among its highest volume since early August. </TEXT></DOC>
