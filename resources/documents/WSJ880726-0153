To each of them he has given this less-than-mystical advice: &quot;You just gotta survive.&quot;    So far, so good. New technologies are emerging locally to beat international bans. Home grown products are replacing hard-to-get imports. New export markets seem to open up as fast as old ones close. Discounts are offered and premiums are paid, but the goods keep moving. A wink here, a nod there, another deal is done. South Africa and its businessmen may be bowed by the sanctions millstone, but they are indeed surviving.    &quot;At the moment, a lot of good is coming from this. We're becoming more innovative and independent,&quot; says Mr. Bell, the retired chief of Armscor, the South African weapons maker that has grown to become a giant in response to the decades-old arms embargo against Pretoria. &quot;We have the ability to do what it takes to survive, in the short and medium term.&quot;    But, as another round of tougher punitive measures moves through the U.S. Congress and the Europeans and Japanese continue to rattle their sanctions sabres, more and more South African businessmen are looking with horror to the long term, beyond the initial burst of benefits from a siege economy. And they are beginning to question the guru's wisdom, asking, &quot;Survive to what?&quot;    The conspiracy of bravado that has surrounded the business community's sanctions-busting efforts is being shattered by dire assessments of what lies ahead if the sanctions noose continues to tighten: little growth, steeply rising unemployment, Third World-type economic controls, escalating social unrest and political violence. The doomsayers have been warning of these consequences since international creditors first called in their loans in 1985. But most businessmen, mimicking the government's defiant go-it-alone attitude, didn't want to listen.    Now, after glimpsing a sanctions-filled future, some leading businessmen are acknowledging that merely surviving is no longer good enough. The emerging slogan in corporate boardrooms is sanctions-containment, not sanctions-busting.    &quot;In this day and age there is no such thing as economic self-sufficiency and we delude ourselves if we think we are different,&quot; Henri de Villiers, chairman of the Standard Bank Investment Corp., said in a recent speech. &quot;It is imperative that we do not adopt poses of defiance and bluster.&quot;    Instead, business is once-again cranking up its long-ineffective lobbying pressure on the apartheid government to move more swiftly toward social and political reform. This time, though, pressure isn't coming from only the usual cabal of liberal English-speaking businessmen; rather, it's a broader coalition of chief executives smitten by a strong dose of future shock, which, they hope, will also shake Pretoria from its bunker.    The &quot;signal&quot; sanctions of the past three years -- intended to send a message of international impatience to Pretoria -- need to be heeded, the businessmen say, to prevent the imposition of &quot;savage&quot; sanctions that could in effect amount to an economic blockade. If more-punitive measures from the U.S. are inevitable, then efforts must be made to keep Britain and West Germany from following suit, they say. The slide into international isolation needs to be checked, they insist, and perhaps reversed.    &quot;Those countries that turn away from the world have remained economic backwaters,&quot; Mr. de Villiers warns. &quot;South Africa needs the world. It needs markets, it needs skills, it needs technology and above all it needs capital.&quot;    In recent weeks, there have been indications the government may be listening. Quiet pressure from top businessmen combined with British and German threats of more sanctions to convince Pretoria to soften legislation that would cut off overseas funding of opposition groups, and to indefinitely postpone the hanging of the Sharpeville Six, a group of blacks sentenced to die for the mob killing of a black town councillor. Business prodding also was a factor motivating the government to pursue peace talks to end the costly war in Angola.    But this doesn't mean Pretoria is about to cave in to the demands of sanctioneers that it scrap apartheid and move toward genuine power sharing with the disenfranchised black majority. The government's inclination toward reform has been curbed by the threat of the pro-apartheid Conservative Party on the right of the white electorate. And, buoyed by the belief that two-thirds of the economy, the precious metals sector, is sanctions-proof, the government still responds to new sanctions threats with its trademark arrogance.    When asked about the measures moving through the U.S. Congress, which, in the harshest version, call for mandatory U.S. disinvestment from South Africa and a halt to all trade, a spokesman in the Department of Trade and Industry says, &quot;Officially, sanctions don't exist. Therefore, I can't comment. 'C'est la vie.'&quot;    Chris van Wyk, the managing director of the Trust Bank of Africa Ltd., cringes when he hears this. &quot;I'm fed up with the feeling that we can go it alone,&quot; he says. &quot;We can't ignore what sanctions and disinvestment have done.&quot;    In a recent speech, which the bank is widely circulating, Mr. van Wyk flouted the taboo of talking about the costs of sanctions and added them up.    By 1990, capital outflows through disinvestment and debt repayment will amount to about 25 billion rands ($10.4 billion), and the accumulated loss of export earnings through trade sanctions will reach 10 billion rands. The economy will grow little more than 2% a year (less than the rate of population increase), rather than the 5% that could have been achieved without sanctions. As a result, Mr. van Wyk says, the average South African will be 5%-10% poorer by 1990, with unemployment increasing by about 200,000 a year.    &quot;Some South Africans are saying we dare not grow faster than 2.5% because the balance of payments can't take it,&quot; Mr. van Wyk says. &quot;That may be true for the short term. But I say South Africa dare not grow 2.5% for the long term. It is too ghastly to contemplate.&quot;    In a new book, &quot;Economics in a Revolutionary Society,&quot; Ronald Bethlehem, an economist at JCI, a Johannesburg-based mining and industrial company, describes a sanctions-filled future. He reckons that by the turn of the century, with sanctions holding the economy to zero growth, 55% of the overwhelmingly black work force would be unemployed, which could push the revolutionary temperature beyond the boiling point.    &quot;It would not be necessary for sanctions to cause a collapse of the South African economy in order to ensure a disaster in 12 to 20 years time,&quot; he writes. &quot;All that they would need to do would be to bring the growth of the economy to a stop.&quot;    Even the sanctions-buster's guru concedes that is a possibility. &quot;In the long term, we can't become totally isolated by sanctions,&quot; says Mr. Bell. &quot;If we get to the stage of total deprivation, we'll develop like a three-legged spider.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
