Critics of the practice fear the highdebt levels, in a recession, would endanger both the bought-outcompany and the banks and firms financing the buyout.   The two senators, in a letter dated Jan. 6 but releasedWednesday, asked for the information from the Treasury Department,Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Reserve Board andother bank regulators.   The senators also asked for any recommendations on whether andhow to curb LBOs.   The House Energy and Commerce Committee, under Rep.
