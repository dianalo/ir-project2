The United States tends to consider itself a moral example tothe rest of the world and has a ``moral-legal'' approach to foreignpolicy, Lee Hsien Loong told the Asia Society Tuesday night.   But it is questionable ``whether U.S. political values andinstitutions are universal commandments which apply to allmankind,'' he added. ``American efforts to make over other peoplesin her own image have not been successful in Asia.''   Lee, 37, a reserve brigadier general, minister of trade andindustry and deputy defense minister, was introduced asrepresentative of the new generation of political leaders in theprosperous Southeast Asian city-state.   He defended Singapore policies that have drawn criticism fromthe U.S. government and from human rights organizations _ the useof preventive arrest against suspected subversives and restrictionson the foreign press.   It is questionable whether the U.S. bill of rights ``is theright model'' for the ``fragile society'' of Singapore, he said,restating arguments his father, the prime minister, has used todefend arrests and press controls as means of averting violenceamong the country's diverse ethnic groups.   Answering audience questions, many about human rights, he saidreports that Singapore police torture government critics areexaggerated.   Despite differences between the two countries, ``to Singapore,the U.S. is a benevolent power,'' Lee said.   Lee said America ``should maintain a military presence in theregion for as long as possible'' because it ``will keep theinfluence of the Soviet Union in check, make it unnecessary forJapan to rearm and balance Peoples Republic of China forces ...''   However, the United States should keep hands off the internalaffairs of the countries of the region, he continued, because,``despite its towering achievements, the American civilization isnot a universally valid model.   ``The export of American values and culture has not alwaysworked,'' not even in countries such as the Philippines and SouthKorea, he said.   In the Philippines, U.S.-style constitutional government basedon checks and balances between branches of government ``was alreadymalfunctioning'' before the era of deposed President FerdinandMarcos, Lee said.   ``An American style free-wheeling press, purveying junk in themarketplace of ideas, led to confusion and bewilderment, not toenlightenment and truth'' in the Philippines, Lee said.   After Marcos was ousted in 1985, he continued, ``the Filipinopress has reverted to their old irresponsible and irrepressibleways. Today, many thoughtful Filipinos wonder whether theirassociation with the U.S. was a stunting or a liberatingexperience.''</TEXT></DOC>
