Boesky in an alleged scheme to violate tax laws, a reportpublished Tuesday said.   The Wall Street Journal, quoting unnamed sources familiar withthe investigation, said the government is focusing on a series oftax-motivated stock trades three years ago between the investmentbanking firm and Boesky's Seemala Corp.   The newspaper said investigators are examining evidencesuggesting Boesky was permitted to buy and sell stock with Drexelto claim immediate trading losses for Seemala for tax purposes, andthat Drexel later reimbursed the company for the losses.   Drexel spokesman Steven S. Anreder said Tuesday the companywould not ``respond to stories based on rumor or leaks. We know ofno wrongdoing by our firm or any of our people. That remains ourposition.''   Since Boesky was charged in the nation's largest insider-tradingcase two years ago, Drexel, along with its junk bond operations,has emerged as the largest target of an ongoing federalsecurities-fraud investigation.   Drexel has yet to be formally charged, but it has been thesubject of numerous press reports. The Securities and ExchangeCommission has recommended civil charges of securities-lawviolations against the firm and some key employees.   The Journal article, however, suggests the case against Drexelmay be expanding to include questions of possible tax-lawviolations.   The Internal Revenue Service, along with the SEC and the U.S.Attorney's office in Manhattan, which reportedly are conducting acriminal investigation of Drexel, are probing the alleged taxscheme, according to the newspaper.   Boesky agreed in November 1986 to pay a record $100 million tosettle insider-trading charges and was sentenced last December tothree years imprisonment on a single felony count of conspiring tolie to the SEC.</TEXT></DOC>
