(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A fugitive wanted for taking hostages at anewspaper is back in federal authorities' hands after disappearingthree weeks ago.   Eddie Hatcher, 30, accused of holding up to 20 hostages at TheRobesonian in Lumberton on Feb. 1, was arrested Monday as he and anattorney arrived on a Piedmont Airlines flight from Newark, N.J.,just minutes before Hatcher's scheduled arraignment.   Hatcher, an American Indian, and a second man charged in theincident said they were protesting alleged corruption anddiscrimination against minorities by Robeson County law enforcementofficials.   The attorney, Ronald Kuby, of New York, declined to discuss hisclient's whereabouts.   When Hatcher was asked where he had been since his disappearanceAug. 31, he responded, ``Over the rainbow.''   U.S. Marshal Bill Berryhill said authorities did not know whereHatcher had been. ``It's rather academic at this point, but yetfrom an investigator's standpoint, tying up our investigation, weneed to try to find out where he's been,'' Berryhill said.   Hatcher decided to surrender after the arraignment date wasannounced last week, Kuby said.   Airport security officers grabbed Hatcher and frisked him in acovered passageway just outside the airplane door. A securityofficer guarded the door into the terminal while officers cuffedHatcher's hands behind his back and led him to a car waiting on thetarmac.   While Hatcher was being taken into custody at the airport, hiscase was called in a federal courtroom in downtown Raleigh.   ``We notified them this morning to watch all flights coming intoRaleigh-Durham because we felt like with his arraignment today hemight come in,'' Berryhill said.   He added that marshals had no tips that Hatcher would return toRaleigh on Monday.   Hatcher's sister, Ginger Clark, watched through an airportwindow as officials led her brother to the waiting car.   She sobbed, pounded on the window and waved in an attempt to gether brother's attention as reporters and photographers stood aroundher. Hatcher looked up and smiled at her.   Aaron Clark, who had rented a limousine to take his brother tothe arraignment, grimaced when he saw his brother in custody.   Hatcher, who was born John Edward Clark, adopted hisgrandfather's family name after the elder man died in 1985.   U.S. District Judge Terrence Boyle entered a plea of innocent onHatcher's behalf, and set his trial to begin Sept. 26, the same daythat Hatcher's co-defendant, Timothy Jacobs, is scheduled to standtrial.   Hatcher disappeared after the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appealsrevoked his bond. He was declared a fugitive after failing tosurrender to U.S. marshals in Raleigh.</TEXT></DOC>
