Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate inthe making of this amendment. Two comments were received in response tothe proposal. One commenter questioned the need for the rule since the referenced servicebulletins will become a part of the Significant Structural Inspection Program(SSIP). The FAA acknowledges that the service bulletins may be part ofthe SSIP; however, the SSIP document is under preparation and its dateof issuance is not known. Once the SSIP is finalized and issued, the FAAmay consider further, separate rulemaking to address it. Since some operatorsmay currently have airplanes which are approaching the specified numberof cycles where the actions described in the service bulletins are necessary,the FAA has determined that it is appropriate to proceed with this rulemakingto require those actions. One commenter requested that Airbus Service Bulletin A300-32-385, Revision1, be reflected in the rule, since it describes procedures for the installationof a reinforced nose landing gear and does not require repetitive inspectionsof the lower section. The FAA agrees that the procedures specified in thatservice bulletin should be made mandatory, but does not concur that theyneed to be a part of this AD. That service bulletin, along with ServiceBulletins A300-32-6022 and A310-32-2039, is addressed in French AirworthinessDirective 88-185-090, and the FAA has issued a separate proposed AD, DocketNumber 89-NM-118-AD, which was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on July 26, 1989 (54 FR 31047), addressing theseservice bulletins. After careful review of the available data, includingthe comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety and thepublic interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed. It is estimated that 90 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected bythis AD, that it will take approximately 5 manhours per airplane to accomplishthe required inspections, and that the average labor cost will be $40 permanhour. It will require approximately 11 manhours to accomplish the modificationat an average labor charge of $40 per manhour and $2,500 parts cost perairplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S.operators is estimated to be $282,600. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effectson the States, on the relationship between the national government andthe States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficientfederalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is nota ``major rule'' under Executive Order 12291; (2) is not a ``significantrule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positiveor negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteriaof the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been preparedfor this action and is contained in the regulatory docket. A copy of itmay be obtained from the Rules Docket. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 </ITAG>Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. <ITAG tagnum="84">Adoption of the Amendment </ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator,the Federal Aviation Administration amends part 39 of the Federal AviationRegulations as follows: <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 39_[AMENDED] </ITAG>1.
