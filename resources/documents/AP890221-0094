RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court ruled today that states mayuse anti-racketeering laws to fight pornography, but invokedfree-speech rights to ban the states from seizing before trial thecontents of adult bookstores.   The justices threw out an obscenity conviction against a FortWayne, Ind., bookstore because authorities seized its contentsbefore trial. But by a 6-3 vote, the justices said prosecutors stillmay use the state's anti-racketeering law to renew the obscenitycase.   Justice Byron R. White, writing for the court, said theConstitution's free-speech protections do not bar states from usingalleged acts of obscenity as a basis for an anti-racketeering law.   ``Given that the (anti-racketeering) statute totally encompassesthe obscenity law, if the latter is not unconstitutionally vague,the former cannot be vague either,'' White said.   In other matters acted on today the court:   _ Allowed Kentucky to begin enforcing a 1986 abortion law thatincludes provisions for parental notification.   _ Refused to reinstate the pandering conviction of a Hollywoodproducer for hiring actors to peform sex acts in a film. TheCalifornia Supreme Court had thrown out the conviction as violatingthe producer's freedom of expression.   _ Rejected a constitutional attack on a Texas seat belt law,letting stand a $35 fine against a Houston lawyer for not bucklingup.   _ The court declined to kill a $90 million suit againstevangelist Jimmy Swaggart by a defrocked evangelist who Swaggart hadaccused of adultery.   _ Let stand rulings that the public has no right to attendso-called ``summary jury trials'' held in some legal disputes. ThreeOhio newspapers had sought to force such proceedings to be held inopen court.   _ Agreed to referee a dispute between the U.S. government andAmerican businesses over whether firms receiving money because ofclaims against Iran must pay part of the money to the U. S.government.   Indiana's Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act ispatterned after the much-used federal act that bears the sameacronym, RICO.   States are using such laws with increasing frequency as apowerful new wepaon to fight obscenity and organized crime.   White said the Indiana law went too far in permitting prosecutorsto padlock adult bookstores before obscenity trials.   While the Constitution generally permits seizure of suspectedcontraband material, White said, ``It is otherwise when materialspresumptively protected by the First Amendment are involved.''   ``Probable cause to believe that there are valid grounds forseizure is insufficient to interrupt the sale of presumptivelyprotected books and films,'' he said.   In a dissenting opinion, Justices John Paul Stevens, William J.Brennan and Thurgood Marshall said the obscenity charges againstFort Wayne Books Inc. should be thrown out.   Stevens, writing for all three, said Indiana's law violates theConstitution by permitting the seizure of a bookstore's contentsafter an obscenity conviction.   Stevens noted that the law allows the seizure based on a judgmentthat two items sold by the store were obscene.   The law allows prosecutors ``to cast wide nets and seize ... theobscene, those non-obscene yet sexually explicit (items), even thosedevoid of sexual reference,'' Stevens said.   The law was used in March 1984 against three Fort Waynebookstores selling sexually explict material. Law enforcementofficials padlocked the stores and seized all inventory.   The three Fort Wayne stores were allowed to reopen in April 1985.But only one, Fort Wayne Books, remains in business.   The Supreme Court today also upheld rulings that permit theHoward County, Ind., sheriff's office to charge Ronald Sappenfieldwith distributing obscene material and violating the state RICO law.That case has yet to go trial.   The cases are Fort Wayne Books vs. Indiana, 87-470, andSappenfield vs. Indiana, 87-614.</TEXT></DOC>
