The archbishop of Canterbury also appealed for restraint afterthe reported killing of a U.S. Marine hostage in Lebanon.Archbishop Robert Runcie's personal envoy, Terry Waite, is one ofthe Westerners held captive in that country.   There were also threats to kill Waite today, but Runcie had nocomment. The Anglican envoy disappeared in January 1987 whiletrying to free other captives.   ``We are in touch with a number of countries in the region andwith the U.S. administration,'' Major said in a statement releasedby the Foreign Office. ``I urge any country with influence to useit to secure the safe return of all hostages.''   Concern for the hostages was heightened Monday after thepurported hanging of Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins. Hiscaptors said he was killed in retaliation for Israel's seizure ofSheik Abdul Karim Obeid, a Moslem cleric linked to terrorism.   Waite's brother, David, appealed again today for all sides torelease their hostages.   John Waite, a cousin of the hostage, said in a televisioninterview that, ``We believe the Israelis should give up the sheik.He is a hostage and he should be released along with all otherhostages.''</TEXT></DOC>
