The U.S. and Japanese currencies fared the best againstcontinental European currencies. The pound and othercurrencies supported by high interest rates held their own.</LP><TEXT>   The biggest loser on the day was the Swiss franc, whichwas sold off when dealers learned that Switzerland'sbenchmark Lombard rate had been lowered to 9.375% from 9.5%Tuesday. Last week, the rate was above 10%.   In addition, comments yesterday by National Bank PresidentMarkus Lusser convinced currency investors that the centralbank will hold firm only on interest rates of long-termsecurities, and not the shortterm paper favored by currencyspeculators.   Late in the New York trading day, the dollar was quoted at1.5595 marks and 1.2900 Swiss francs, up from 1.5563 marksand 1.2867 francs late Tuesday in New York. The U.S. currencywas also changing hands at 143.60 yen, down from 143.73 yen.   The yen posted gains against the mark and Swiss franc. Themark declined to 92.081 yen from 92.354 yen, and the francdropped to 111.318 yen from 111.704 yen.

Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about1.5599 marks, up from Wednesday's Tokyo close of 1.5556marks.   The market's movements yesterday also reflected the firstattempts by dealers to level positions ahead of month-endaccounting and a holiday weekend in North America.   Amid these adjustments, the dollar is enjoying a graceperiod, said Mark Morris, a dealer in New York for NationalWestminster Bank. Even as it retains lingering support as a&quot;haven&quot; from Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the greenback isgaining from the effect that new-found optimism for peace ishaving on oil prices.   Once dealers are completely free to ignore Baghdad, hesaid, the dollar will fall once again. Even cheap oil won'tsave the wobbly U.S. economy, many observers think.   Sterling was trading late in New York at $1.9460, up from$1.9428 Tuesday. The Canadian and Australian dollars ended at87.63 cents and 83.12 cents, respectively, up from 87.54cents and 82.97 cents.   In fact, these so-called Anglo high-yielders, which hadrisen in recent weeks because of their status aspetrocurrencies, stood to lose yesterday as the benchmarkcrude oil futures contract fell $1.96 on the New YorkMercantile Exchange to $25.92 a barrel. But interest-rateshopping held these currencies firm.   Meanwhile, speculation about a possible Japanesediscount-rate increase heated up as two Japanese dailynewspapers reported that the Finance Ministry and Bank ofJapan had started discussing such a move Tuesday. Bank ofJapan Governor Yasushi Mieno denied any such discussionsWednesday. However, early Thursday in Tokyo, the Bank ofJapan raised the discount rate by 0.75 percentage point to6%.   Analysts had been looking for the Bank of Japan to raiseits discount rate by early October, after the central bank'squarterly survey of business sentiment and the second-quartergross national product report come out in the middle ofSeptember.   Jumpei Ishii, deputy foreign-exchange department managerat Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank, said the market has factored arise of 75 basis points in the discount rate into the market.Mr. Ishii himself predicted a rise to 6.25% from the current5.25%.
