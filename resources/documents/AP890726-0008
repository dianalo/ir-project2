Meanwhile, smoldering embers from last week's series ofdry-lightning storms sparked another blaze to the south in theBoise National Forest.   Additional manpower was added to the 340 firefighters on theJohnson Butte Fire after it broke through containment lines againMonday to sweep across grass and scattered stands of ponderosapine, doubling in size to 1,000 acres in steep, rugged terrain.   The target for containment was pushed back two days to Saturday,and officials predicted the fire would cover 5,000 acres before itwas finally reined in.   Nez Perce National Forest fire bosses also hoped to bringmanpower up to as many as 300 on the smaller but more intense CapeHorn Fire, burning on 170 acres of heavier fuel in an almostinaccessible canyon about 12 miles to the east.   No private property was threatened by either fire.   Meanwhile, far to the northeast, hundreds of fires had blackenedmore than 2.2 million acres of forest in northern Manitoba andSaskatchewan. Canadian officials said the flames had forced theevacuation of more than 19,000 people.   Thousands of gallons of chemical retardant were dropped byaerial tankers in an unsuccessful bid to stop the Johnson Butteblaze Monday. Flames overran a break on the northern fire line andbegan spreading south to the main Salmon River.   The Johnson Butte Fire grew from 1,000 to 2,000 acres on Tuesdayas crews worked to establish lines of defense against the flamesburning through grass and scattered stands of ponderosa pine.   ``The fire moved more quickly than they estimated so they had toabandon that line,'' spokeswoman Elayne Murphy said. ``It's justreal steep, rugged terrain and inaccessible, so in order to fightthis fire what they're doing is identifying places that areaccessible and digging in there.''   Ground crews, backed up by five helicopters, had three miles offire line but had to carve six more miles.   Crews had to hike four miles just to get to the perimeter of theCape Horn fire, and began work on a landing zone to make that blazemore accessible. Three helicopters were prepared to ferryfirefighers in and out.   No containment target was set yet.   To the south, firefighters on Monday contained the 230-acreTrail Fire near Sun Valley in central Idaho's Sawtooth NationalForest. The resort area was not threatened.   ``What really saved us was that they already had an air tankerin the air yesterday and they diverted it to us,'' spokeswomanBarbara Todd said. ``Those four or five retardant drops helpedout.''   Elsewhere in Idaho, the situation was improved from last week,when a series of storms hit western and central Idaho forests withhundreds of dry lightning strikes.</TEXT></DOC>
