The bond market's bellwether security, the 30-yearTreasury bond, spiraled 1 1/8 point lower, a loss of $11.25for a bond with a $1,000 face amount. Yesterday's decline wasthe sixth consecutive loss for bond prices. The price on thebenchmark bond was quoted late yesterday at 103 7/8.</LP><TEXT>   The 30-year issue's yield, which moves in the oppositedirection as price, rose to 7.67%, about where it stood priorto the Fed's aggressive full-point discount rate cut on Dec.20. Following that move, yields on the benchmark bond fell aslow as 7.35%.   Traders said a host of factors contributed to yesterday'ssell-off, including a big commodities price rise, dealerselling to hedge a huge wave of corporate debt issuance andheightened concerns that any new fiscal stimulus packageproposed by the White House or Congress will be inflationary.   But most analysts agree with Tokai Bank's chief economist,Robert McGee, who contends the major reason behind themarket's plunge is that &quot;people are starting to believe thatbetter economic times are inevitable.&quot;   They disagree, however, on whether the current marketdeterioration is the start of something bigger or is just atemporary correction to a rally.   &quot;I think we're on the way further down. The risk is for an8% to 8.25% yield on the bond,&quot; says Douglas Schindewolf, amoney market economist at Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co.Without all signs pointing to further economic weakness,&quot;supply is also becoming a big threat to the market,&quot; andthere will be plenty of supply to digest, he adds.   Of the opposite opinion is Anthony Karydakis, seniorfinancial economist at First National Bank of Chicago. Hecontends that &quot;what is going on right now is primarily theresult of an extremely negative psychology set off byirrational fears. If there's going to be {an economic}recovery, it will be moderate so it won't jeopardize theinflation picture.&quot;   He adds, &quot;the behavior of the market in last week or so isa major hiccup, not the beginning of a sustainable upturn inrates.&quot;   The yield curve, or the gap between short-term andlong-term interest rates, widened considerably, with Treasurybill rates falling as yields on long-term bonds spurted.   The bellwether 30-year bond now yields 3.80 percentagepoints more than the bond-equivalent yield on three-monthTreasury bills, much wider than the 3.64 percentage pointspread quoted late Wednesday and the 3.54 percentage pointspread seen a month ago.   Meanwhile, although the M2 money supply measure fell by ahuge $12.8 billion in the week ended Jan. 6, far exceedingexpectations, that news failed to stem the long Treasurybond's deterioration. A $5.3 billion M2 decline was theaverage forecast from economists polled by Dow Jones CapitalMarkets Report.   Today, at 8:30 a.m. EST, the U.S. November trade balanceis scheduled to be released. Based on a survey of economistsby Dow Jones Capital Markets Report, the deficit is seennarrowing to $6.4 billion, from $6.73 billion in October.   U.S. industrial production and capacity utilization forDecember also are due out today.                                                                                                          Corporate andamp; Junk Bonds                                                                                                          Corporations continued to bombard investors with new bondsand notes amid a sharp rise in interest rates.   More than $1.5 billion of debt securities were sold in thecorporate market yesterday, with Hydro-Quebec, the Canadianutility, weighing in with $1 billion of the new debt offered.Also in the market were a number of U.S. corporations, suchas Fleet/Norstar Financial Group Inc. and Woolworth Corp.   Hydro-Quebec's $1 billion of 30-year debentures werepriced to yield 8.467%. The noncallable debentures werepriced at a spread of 0.85 percentage point above theTreasury's 30-year bond.   Even though the $1 billion Hydro-Quebec issue was offerednear the end of a heavy week of financing, traders said thebonds met with brisk demand.   In the secondary market for investment-grade corporatedebt, prices of high-grade bonds ended as much as 1 pointlower.   In the junk bond market, high-yield bonds, orspeculative-grade bonds with low credit ratings or no creditratings at all, generally ended little changed.                                                                                                          Municipal Bonds                                                                                                          Prices of municipal bonds ended as much as a point lowerin volatile trading.   Among seasoned names, the Denver airport system'sbellwether bond, the 7.75% issue of 2021, was down 1 at 973/4 to yield 7.96%.   In limited new issue action, underwriters at Merrill Lynchandamp; Co. reported an unsold balance of about $63 million on anoffering of $140.7 million of Norfolk, Va., generalobligation capital improvement and refunding bonds.   The bonds, won in a competitive sale, were priced to yieldfrom 2.75% in 1993 to 6.25% in 2010-2012.   The bonds are rated double-A by both Moody's InvestorsService Inc. and Standard andamp; Poor's Corp.                                                                                                          Mortgage andamp; Asset-Backed Securities                                                                                                          Mortgage securities resumed their descent in sympathy withTreasurys, proving Wednesday's stability to be just a briefrespite.   In secondary trading, Government National MortgageAssociation 7.5% securities for delivery in February were11/32 weaker at 98 16/32, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.Gold 7.5% securities were down 14/32 to 97 16/32 and FederalNational Mortgage Association 7.5% securities were 14/32lower at 97 11/32.   These securities have been sliding since last Friday, whena surprise rise in December employment sparked concerns thatthe economy's worst period has past.   Still, mortgage securities didn't lose as much ground asTreasurys yesterday thanks to continued dealer demand forcollateral for real estate mortgage investment conduitofferings. Remic issuance got off to a heated start earlythis year, and there is no sign of any let-up, market playersnote.   Yesterday's Treasury yield curve steepening, in whichshort-term rates fell while bond yields jumped, makes Remicissuance more attractive. Most class of Remic deals are tiedto short-term Treasury securities yields.   Two Freddie Mac Remic offerings totaling $1.4 billion wereannounced, after Wednesday's $1.2 billion of Freddie MacRemic securities.   Analysts at Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Corp.write that Remic &quot;issuance last week was the heaviest onrecord, as 17 new deals and four upsizings totaling $7.3billion were priced.&quot;   Remic activity &quot;was the dominant force last week,&quot; theyadd. The collateral for these deals &quot;varied across thespectrum of coupons, and with market sentiment extremelyvaried as to the direction of interest rates and expectedprepayments, these conditions will likely persist.&quot;   Collateral was again diverse for yesterday's new issues.The $1 billion Freddie Mac series Gold 1212 was backed by theagency's Gold 8% mortgage securities, while the $400 millionFreddie Mac series Gold 1211 was collateralized with theagency's Gold 15-year 7.5% mortgage securities.</TEXT></DOC>
