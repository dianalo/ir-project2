U.S. District Judge Louis Oberdorfer ruled Wednesday that theEPA had acted illegally by allowing 197 holders of federalpesticide licenses to sell existing stocks of products containingthe pesticides chlordane and heptachlor.   Oberdorfer said the EPA failed to take into account whethercontinued sale or use of the products ``would pose any unreasonablerisk to man or the environment.''   Last year, Velsicol Chemical Corp., the nation's onlymanufacturer of chlordane and heptachlor, agreed to stop sellingthe chemical while it tries to find an acceptable method ofapplying the pesticide.   But the EPA's agreement with Velsicol did not cover productscontaining chlordane made by other companies for the retail market.   The agency estimates these companies have 1,700 pounds ofchlordane products in their stocks compared with the 110,000 poundsin Velsicol's inventory.</TEXT><HEAD>___</HEAD><HEAD>Police Urge Waiting Period for Handgun Buyers</HEAD><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federally imposed waiting period forwould-be gun buyers would save lives by letting violence-pronecustomers cool down, say olice officials.   Representatives of national, state and local police Wednesdayurged the House Judiciary subcommitee on crime to advancelegislation requiring a waiting period after any request to buy ahandgun.   The crime panel is considering a number of bills that wouldrequire a delay of at least seven days between the time a buyerenters a gun store and when the customer gets the weapon.   Also under consideration are plans to require background checksof would-be buyers, including comparison of their fingerprints toFBI records.   Both ideas were strongly opposed by pro-gun groups and somemembers of Congress as ineffective against violent crimes andunfair to legitimate gun buyers. The National Rifle Associationcalled the plan ``irrelevant, useless, costly andunconstitutional.''</TEXT><HEAD>___</HEAD><HEAD>Filing Tax Forms Through Computers Speeds Returns, IRS Says</HEAD><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Up to 1 million taxpayers will receive federalrefunds as much as three weeks earlier this year by having aprofessional file their tax returns directly into the IRS computer.   Already this year, 119,494 returns have been filedelectronically _ compared with 77,612 for the entire filing seasonin 1987. If the taxpayers choose, their refunds will be depositeddirectly into their bank account.   Although the number of electronic returns are up considerablythis year, the volume of ordinary, paper returns filed so far is6.7 percent below last year's pace. However, the gap _ whichofficials blame partially on the new tax law _ is closing each week.   Through Feb. 19, the Internal Revenue Service said Wednesday,23.55 million returns had been filed, compared with 25.24 million ayear ago. The IRS has processed 9.74 million of this year'sreturns, up slightly from 9.72 million last year.
