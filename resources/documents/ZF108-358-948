 Besides these highlights, there were someother developments that are worthy of brief mention before we provide detailsof the key events.andM;In addition, Xitron showed its new 600-dpi plain-paper printer based on aWeitek PostScript RIP and an Hitachi engine, which appears earlier in thissection.andM;Cybergraphic on sales front.andP;  Cybergraphic is moving to capitalize on theexposure it is receiving as a result of its key installation at The Nationalsport daily (see Vol.andP;  19, No.andP;  11), where it is producing theblack-and-white pages.andP;  Since then; Cybergraphic has signed a contract toinstall a system at the Hagerstown (MD) Morning Herald (cir.andP;  20,000) andDaily Mail (circ.andP;  22,000).andP;  We were told that two metropolitan papers wouldsign contracts this month.andP;  We'll report all three of these sales in detailat the time.andM;INSI starts beta testing.andP;  Integrated Newspaper Systems has begun betatesting of its editorial system at the Fall River (MA) Herald News (circ.andO;38,000), an Ingersoll property.andP;  The system will have 2 IBM AS/400 Model B35central computers with 25 PCs as editorial terminals, although only eight PCsare installed for the initial testing.andM;Testing of the classified system will began after the editorial system hasbeen thoroughly tested.andM;At America East, though, neither of these systems was exhibited.andP;  A single PCwas running circulation and advertising management software.andM;What ever happened to Chelgraph?andP;  Ironically, Chelgraph was the subject ofnews both at America East and at the Type-X show that ran concurrently inPhiladelphia, in spite of the fact that it didn't have a booth at eitherevent.andP;  (The only Chelgraph representation was a Copal printer in the Mycro-Tek booth in Hershey and an IBM Ace-language typesetter in the CPS exhibit atType-X.)andM;Unfortunately, the news was the growing frustration over Chelgraph's failureto get its PostScript imagesetters into the field.andP;  Its distributors arestuck without machines to sell.andP;  Customers evaluating what is now a largegroup of competitive machines would like to see what Derek Kyte has come upwith.andP;  Several show visitors asked us where to find the Electra booth--onlyto be told that there was none.andM;We asked Dave deBronkart, who heads Chelgraph's U.S.andP;  presence, what wasgoing on.andP;  He replied that the demand for the 600-dpi Copal printer has beenso great that that machine is using most of the company's resources.andP;  Davesaid that Chelgraph has tripled its manufacturing capacity for the Copalunit, but that all machines that can be produced between now and October havealready been allocated.andM;Mycro-Tek.andP;  Mycro-Tek didn't have any mayor announcements to make, but it diddemonstrate minor changes to its MasterPlanner program for preparing dummiesand its AdWriter software for display ads.andP;  For MasterPlanner, it has addedthe ability to specify the percentage of ads that can be used on apage-by-page basis, rather than for a section.andP;  Also new is support for clashcodes.andM;For AdWriter, new features are automatic masking and variable line screens,plus some speed improvements.andM;Atex 3000 ready for U.S.?andM;The die hasn't quite been cast, but Atex appears to be on the verge oflaunching its PC Publishing System 3000 editorial system in the U.S.andP;  ThePC-based product, which was developed by Atex Ltd. in the UK (see Vol.andP;  18,No.andP;  12), was shown publicly in the U.S.andP;  for the first time at America East.andO;We were told that the U.S.andP;  support staff is being trained.andM;But Atex has yet to make a formal announcement about starting to take orders.andO;We believe it would like to have a few customers lined up before making thedefinitive commitment.andM;Atex said that the system is selling well in the UK and that it has beeninstalled in Germany (publishing a Catholic weekly) and in Moscow (atPravda).andM;At last year's ANPA show, where the 3000 was demonstrated to a selectedaudience in a hotel suite, the effort was mostly part of some marketresearch.andP;  Atex said the response at ANPA was good.andP;  The delay in making adecision may in part reflect questions about supporting another entireproduct.andP;  Atex already has a PC-based product in the U.S.--the Pc Page Makeupsystem that uses Writer Software (XyWriter) and Archetype pagination on anAtex network with A Sun or IBM file server.andM;It may look as though there is some redundancy here, but the PC Page Makeupsystem is part of Atex's magazine operation.andP;  The 3000 is being handled bythe newspaper group.andP;  Both of these systems support editorial applications,not classified.andP;  The 3000 can be linked to an Arex Integrated AdvertisingSystem (IAS).andM;The product.andP;  On display was release 1.1, which will be superseded soon by alater version planned for unveiling at Drupa.andP;  This next version will supporta mouse.andP;  The 3000 runs in PS/2 workstations on Atex networks with Sun fileservers.andM;The 3000 system consists of three modules that serve different needs.andP;  Thefirst one is an input and editing program based on Writer Software (which isalso the basis of PC Page Makeup) running in networked PCs.andP;  A fewmodifications have been made to Writer Software to serve in the 3000 system(including the use of some menus).andM;Page layout is done in the second module, which was developed in conjunctionwith APT Systems of the UK.andP;  Anyone familiar with the former PagePlannerprogram will recognize some similarity in the way this one approaches layout.andO;The left side of the screen is used for selecting stories and specifying theareas they will flow into, using straightforward commands such as to flowfrom one line below a specified picture to the bottom of the column.andP;  Theright side displays the page with any elements that have been assigned.andP;  Textcan be specified either as flowing according to column measures indicated ascommands in the text file or as fitting the column measure drawn on thescreen.andM;One recent addition to the layout program is that the system repaints onlythe changed part of the screen when a change is made to the layout, ratherthan requiring that the entire screen be repainted.andM;No text editing takes place in the layout mode.andP;  To make changes to the text,the operator has two choices: go back to the original file and edit usingWriter Software, which doesn't reflect any layout done in the layout program,or enter the third module: interactive counting.andM;The interactive counting mode enables the user to see line breaks as text isentered or edited, rather than running handamp;j only as a batch process.andP;  Thebasic display shows all text at the same size, with a nice facility forreporting the interword space used on each line, but it can be switchedeasily into a WYSIWYG preview of the page, showing layout areas and text inactual sizes.andM;The layout and interactive counting models are part of the original APTdevelopment.andP;  Support for Writer Software has been added for Atex.andP;  The linkbetween them is good, but it is a definite disadvantage that text beingedited in Writer Software can't be handamp;j'ed against the page layout.andP;  It ishandamp;j'ed only against a format command.andM;Pricing and availability.andP;  Because the system hasn't been announced assupported in the U.S., it is too early to quote pricing and delivery dates.andO;We expect these to be worked out in time for ANPA June 16-20, provided thatAtex goes ahead with the idea of selling the system in this country.andM;Camex shows 3 linesandM;The Camex booth had the usual broad lineup of products, including the nearlyready AdStylist program for the Macintosh, the Sun-based Whirlwind classifiedsystem soon to be running at the Houston Chronicle and the Editorial ControlPagination (ECP) system based on Intertext software running on a PC.andM;There was no discussion about or sign of changes resulting from the recentdecision by Du Pont to merge its CSI operation into Camex.andP;  We hope to havemore information on the Du PontCrosfield/Camex front in our next issue afterDu Pont holds a press conference on the subject in Monte Carlo on April 4.andM;AdStylist.andP;  We explained the philosophy of AdStylist last year at ANPA, wherethe product was shown in early form.andP;  It is basically the Breeze softwarerunning on a Mac, with some differences that reflect primarily the hardwareplatform (Sun vs.andP;  Mac).andP;  The Mac version doesn't support as many graphicsfeatures, it lacks some of the color and layering capabilities, and itdoesn't have the Breeze's speed.andP;  It also won't support kerning or display oftrue fonts until Apple's System 7 software is ready.andP;  In the field of color,the first release won't do color separations, but this capability will beadded in a later release.andP;  Rotation of elements wasn't demonstrated, but itwill be included in the first release, Camex said.andM;On the plus side, AdStylist has some features that the Breeze doesn't have,including some items that come with the Macintosh user interface as well asmore &quot;power keys&quot; for streamlining common functions.andM;Also new is a nice handamp;j feature that allows the operation to specify thesystem's &quot;propensity to hyphenate&quot; by selecting high, moderate, low or nohyphenation.andP;  We weren't able to get a complete explanation of how thisfeature will work, but we believe that it applies additional interword spaceas needed in order to avoid frequent hyphenation and vice versa, while stillworking within the maximum allowable amount.andM;It accepts standard file formats from other Macintosh applications andclip-art libraries.andM;AdStylist will output either a PostScript file to any PostScript device or anSPDL file to be processed on a Camex system.andP;  Camex said it is committed tosupporting Autologic's GICL languages on all of its systems also, includingAdStylist.andM;AdStylist runs on a Macintosh II with 4 or 8 MB of memory and a 40-MB harddisk.andP;  The software has been priced at $2,495 outputting PostScript only, or$5,000 to connect to a Breeze, with discounts for multiple copies.andP;  Thissounds like very attractive pricing, especially in view of what DigitalTechnology now charges for its full-function ad system on the Mac ($4,995 forthe monochrome version, $5,995 for color).andM;AdStylist is currently in testing at the Boston Globe.andP;  Camex said it wouldhave about 25 customers when the initial release is available soon.andP;  Theseare all existing users who are waiting for the release to be ready.andM;Whirlwind.andP;  The classified ad system destined for Houston, given the nameWhirlwind at IFRA last fall, was demonstrated on a Sun Sparcstation.andP;  Camexsaid that it had installed the JCS database system in Houston and the nextstep is to get the Whirlwind classified system up and running, after whichefforts will switch to editorial matters.andP;  Camex said development of theeditorial system hasn't begun yet.andM;The product on display was the system as being configured for Houston.andO;Because the system is extremely customizable, many items would likely lookdifferent for a different customer.andM;Running with a large monitor, the classified system makes extensive use ofpopup menus as ads are taken.andP;  A long line of buttons is available to beclicked to access items such as ad scheduling and edition speficiation.andP;  Onenovel feature we haven't seen before is a WYSIWYG window for showing how thead will look in print.andP;  This is updated interactively as the format and textare typed by the ad taker.andP;  Another window is used for electronic mail.andM;The various windows can be shrunk into icons and brought back with a mouseclick.andM;Pagination.andP;  Camex hasn't made any formal announcement about the evolution ofits former Intertext editorial system, but Intertext now is being sold as anadd-on pagination system rather than as an editorial system in its own right.andO;It is called Editorial Control Pagination (ECP).andP;  The full editorial featuresremain supported within ECP.andM;At IFRA, we reported the first customer to install this system for paginationthe Halifax (Nova Scotia) Chronicle-Herald and Mail-Star, where it is servingas a back-end pagination system for a DEC TMS-11 editorial system.andP;  Camexsaid Halifax is currently paginating most of the paper (except the stocks andsports agate pages) with 20 ECP terminals, used to produce three editions.andM;At America East, Camex announced the second ECP site:  the Idaho Falls (ID)Post-Register, which has a CSI front end.andP;  The system, which will beinstalled within 60 days, will have six ECP terminals.andM;As we have reported previously, ECP extends the basic Intertext facility formodular makeup of stories to enable the operator to work on the entire page.andO;A good status display on the right side of the screen tells the progress ofeach story on the page, while the page itself is displayed on the left withdifferent colors for different types of elements, indications of whichstories have been flowed on the page, and so on.andM;Synaptic's Quark linkandM;Synaptic Electronic Publisher--the company that resulted from the merger lastyear of Synaptic Micro Solutions and The Electronic Publisher--demonstratednew features for its SunType classified system, new developments for usingQuark Xpress as the pagination program for the SunType editorial system, alibrary archival system, and support for the Da Vinci electronic-mail system.andM;Pagination.andP;  Files are prepared in the normal way on the PC-based SunTypeeditorial system.andP;  Synaptic has written a Quark Xtension (called Newslink)that allows the transfer of story header information, style tags and text toa Macintosh running Xpress.andP;  When a directory is called for, the Macintoshscreen provides an area for the display of information about the story thatis currently selected.andP;  Information includes the header and a 29-characterslug.andM;When pages are laid out using Xpress, under the current scenario all filesare recomposed using Quark's handamp;j.andP;  Synaptic says its current approach is totry to set up the two programs to achieve the closest possible match.andP;  Overthe long run, the plan is more ambitious.andP;  Synaptic is writing an Xtensionthat will give Quark the ability to honor line endings received from SunType,with a nice option that allows the operator to override those line endings ona single-paragraph basis to make editing changes.andP;  In essence, individualparagraphs will be &quot;unlocked&quot; for changes.andM;For classified pagination, Synaptic already is passing line endings to Xpressso that price quotations will be accurately maintained as ads are passed fromone system to the other.andM;Another future development worth mentioning here relates to interaction ofmultiple users on a single system.andP;  Synaptic hopes to be able to demonstratewithin a year the ability to lock stories on a page on a story-by-storybasis, rather than locking out the entire page or section being worked on, asis the custom with the standard Xpress program.andP;  Synaptic would like to makeit easy for individual users to ask for a quick update of the page to reflectchanges made by other people working on the same page.andM;Where do these developments leave the Advent 382 program that Synaptic hasbeen showing as its pagination solution for SunType?andP;  We were told that 3B2will continue to be developed and sold as the product for people who want anall-PC system, but that Quark has proved to be easier to adapt to thecompany's needs.andM;Classified.andP;  Synaptic, which says it has more than 250 customers using itsSunType classified system, demonstrated version 4.0 of the software, which isaimed at improving the handling of large numbers of ads and streamliningbookkeeping.andP;  With these improvements, SunType has become an impressiveclassified program--which is quite a difference from the product we saw inits early days when it was only a low-end system.andM;Version 4.0 includes an interesting approach to scheduling that doesn'trequire filling in a different calendar for each edition.andP;  The screendisplays a list of days of the week and the active editions available on eachday.andP;  The operator specifies the days and editions appropriate for each ad torun.andP;  Function keys identified at the bottom of the screen can be used toshortcut the operation, such as to copy the setup for one week to the nextweek or to alternate weeks, or to delete all entries from a specified pointon.andM;The rating facilities are greatly enhanced, supporting 99 tables, 26editions, 18 special rates per table, 9,999 classifications, and super- andsubclasses.andM;A built-in, flexible report/from design system makes it possible to implementnew reports without programming, including reports on revenue per edition orpages typeset.andP;  The program is compatible with Novell's Xtrieve, which aidsin creating sophisticated queries and reports.andM;Other highlights include facilities to give supervisors control over whichfunctions each user can access, the ability to import ASCII text files, anexpanded spelling checker, optional &quot;hard&quot; and soft&quot; searching on phonenumbers (a hard search fails rather than showing the closest number), testingof credit card numbers for numeric integrity and maintenance of historyfiles, from a list of 24 new items.andM;Library system.andP;  Synaptic is now supporting the Folio Views library andarchive system from Folio, located in Provo, Utah.andP;  The first installation isexpected soon.andP;  As part of a SunType system, the library is called NewsLib.andM;NewsLib is a full-text storage and retrieval system that runs on PCs.andP;  Itindexes every word, rather than permitting certain words to be ignoredbecause they aren't likely to be the subject of a search (&quot;a,&quot; &quot;the,&quot; etc.).andO;But it compresses the data approximately in half, alleviating somewhat thestorage requirement.andM;Search facilities are good, supporting a variety of boolean operators,proximity searches (ordered or not), and fuzzy and wildcard searches (whereone or more characters in a keyword are unspecified).andP;  Search setups can besaved as named files and recalled for later use.andM;At the show, the search was fast, but there was no way to test it undernormal editorial conditions.andM;Searches can be conducted from within the editorial system, enabling areporter to cut text from the archived story and paste it into a current textbuffer.andM;Synaptic says NewsLib can index, compress and add to the archive stories at arate of about six to eight megabytes per hour.andM;Archive files are maintained in the Folio InfoBase format, which makes itcompatible with some existing databases, including the Congressional Record,the Federal Register, the World Factbook and the King James Bible.andM;SCS: class paginationandM;Software Consulting Services of Nazareth, PA, demonstrated its Mac-basedclassified ad pagination system for the first time.andP;  Developed jointly withthe Pongrass Australia Pty., Ltd., as a Quark Xtension, the system is nowbeing used by two newspapers--a Spanish newspaper in New York City and LeDroit, a French daily located in Ottawa, Canada.andM;It allows you to create any number of columns on a page and to place agateand display ads automatically (bottom up or top down) or by clicking anddragging them yourself.andP;  You can lock any number of ads in place and it canreflow ads automatically around any locked ads, trying to fill all availablespace.andP;  This last feature seems to work well--it really was automatic andspeedy on the Mac IIs it was demonstrated on.andP;  If an agate ad is split, ittells you how many lines were placed on that page and how many were leftover.andP;  There are several irritating problems with this first version.andP;  Oncethe page is laid out, it is locked and you can only view it; you can't goback and work on it.andP;  In addition, if text/such as advice or horoscopecolumns) is to appear on the same page as class ads, you have to leave roomfor it, import the pages into Quark and then flow the text into the emptyspace.andM;A major problem is that in order to place repetitive page text such as thename of the newspaper, the section, page numbers and so on, the page has tobe saved as an Encapsulated PostScript file and imported via SCS/LinX intoQuark, where the user then overlays the EPS page with the appropriate Quarkpage template.andP;  This two-step process also affects the way the display adsare handled, but in an unobtrusive way.andP;  The display ads are really made partof the page after the page is brought into Quark, but no additional layoutwork is necessary.andP;  SCS representatives said they are working on eliminatingthe two-step process.andM;Users must have SCS's Layout-8000 product to use the new classified adpagination system, although any classified ad entry system that outputs EPSfiles can be used.andP;  The product is available through $15,000 site licenses.andM;Sinclair picture deskandM;Sinclair Communications (Springfield, NJ), the sistem company of SinclairImaging Systems (London, England), has introduced an entry-level image serverfor its Picture Post electronic picture desk.andP;  The new unit, which supportstwo to three users, broadens the appeal of Sinclair's picture desk to includesmaller and medium-sized dailies.andM;The new image server, the K2500 Picture Box, was introduced at America Easton March 28.andP;  We were told it differs from Sinclair's larger unit only indisk capacity and terminals supported:  the larger unit supports 16 users;the K2500 is sold with one workstation but could support two colorworkstations or three monochrome stations.andM;The Picture Box has internal storage for about 40 color photos; a larger diskdrive could be substituted.andP;  In comparison, the larger K2000 is arack-mounted system that offers a variety of configuration options.andM;The Picture Box runs the same picture capture, storage and manipulationsoftware as the Picture Post, if a PC workstation is part of the system.andO;(The basic unit is sold with a keyboard-based terminal that does not dosizing.)andM;A complete Picture Box, with color workstation, is $23,900.andP;  The softwarecompatibility makes it possible to upgrade to the larger unit and still usethe existing picture database and workstations.andM;All Sinclair picture desks drive the Autokon 1000, Dixel 2000, Sinclair K970,Monotype and Visor-D recorders.andP;  The K970 is laser-based continuous-tonedigital printer that images an 8&quot; X 10&quot; image on film in two minuts.andP;  Itoffers high resolution (2k X 2k X 8 bits) and decent speed at a relativelymodest price ($17,500).andM;Output filters also are available for Macs, PCs, Scitex, Camex and theMonotype Graphics System.andP;  Bidirectional interfaces are offered for theAutokon and the Mac II.andM;Sinclair said it is ready to begin shipments of the new units.andP;  It has 45Picture Post customers in Europe; its first customer in the U.S.andP;  is the SanFrancisco Examiner.andM;Levien's photo editorandM;Levien Instruments has added a neat feature to the Byso wire-photo captureand editing terminal.andP;  Like many picture desks, the Levien software displaysan on-screen densitometer under control of a mouse cursor.andP;  The user candisplay the density, point by point, of the cyan, magenta or yellowcomponents of a wire-service color photo.andP;  Unlike others, Levien allow theuser to make a global density adjustment based on the density at the cursor.andO;For example, if the cursor is placed over a shadow area, lightening the imagethere lightens it in all the shadow areas of the picture.andP;  Reducing the cyanlevel at a point of middle density reduces the cyan midtones everywhere.andM;Other systems display a gamma curve graphically and let you move points onthe curve, then preview the effect on the screen.andP;  Levien has skipped thegraphic display, which is, after all, a rather abstract way of working withcolor.andP;  Instead, the system selects the portion of the curve to affect basedon what is under the mouse.andP;  The operator simply points at the portion of thephoto that need adjustment.andM;A proprietary algorithm is used to assure that the curves (even though hiddenand implicit) remain smooth and the photo's apperance remains natural; thisis not the system to use if you want startling posterization effects.andP;  Nordoes the software support pixel editing, airbrushing or other creativeeffects.andM;Levien's software includes calibration software.andP;  The computer outputs a testpage, which is printed on normal job stock; the user can then takedensitometer readings from press sheets and type the values into thecomputer.andP;  When the software is properly calibrated, it should be possible tomake photo adjustments entirely by eye with a high degree of confidence thatthe printed page will look good.andM;Another important feature is registration control.andP;  Wire services transmit acolor image as three separate monochrome layers, each of which is susceptibleto line noise and distortion.andP;  Levien's software, we were told, performs anautomatic registration process that gives good results 90% of the time.andP;  Likemost picture desks, it assumes that most features of an image will occur inall three layers.andP;  If the operator doesn't like the result, he can redo it,using the mouse to point out features that the software should use asalignment references.andM;Levien has conducted tests at the High Point (NC) Enterprise, with somecredible press samples to show.andP;  However, no papers have purchased thesystem.andM;AP's impact.andP;  Like most vendors of wire-photo equipment, Levien has beenseriously affected by AP's decision to provide the Leafdesk to all itsmembers.andP;  However, Levien has been hit harder than its competitors, since ithas no installed based at all.andP;  Raph Levien, the firm's software wizard, saidthat he plans to make the Byso system compatible with the AP/Leaf data formatas soon as a format definition becomes available.andP;  In the meantime, he isattempting to position the system more as a picture database and colorseparation product than a wire capture product.andM;It is apparent to us that Levien's evident software prowess had not beenmatched by commercial success, even before AP's announcement.andP;  While we doubtthat the announcement will prove fatal, it may force the principals toredirect their focus.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
