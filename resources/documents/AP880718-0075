(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Race has been ruled out as a motive forthe slaying of a young black woman found with ``KKK'' scratchedinto her thighs, police said.   A black man, Jeffrey Allen Dawson, 29, of Kingston, was beingheld without bail in the Ulster County jail in the death. Policesaid Sunday that Dawson knew the victim, Anna Kithcart, 19, ofKingston, and that both were drug abusers.   Dawson was arrested late Saturday and pleaded innocent to asecond-degree murder charge this morning at his arraigment in CityCourt.   The young woman's partially clad body was found Tuesday morningbehind Kingston Hospital.   Kingston police Detective Michael Turck said Sunday that anyracial motive in the case has now been ruled out, despite earlyspeculation that it might be race related because of the KKKinscription, presumed to represent the initials of the Ku Klux Klan.   Dawson and the victim were both seen at the Royal Grill barMonday evening just before Miss Kithcart's death. But Turck saidpolice were not sure whether they were together or if they left atthe same time.   Sometime afterward, police said, the two apparently got into anargument behind the hospital, a few blocks from the bar. Kithcart'sbody showed evidence of strangulation and a blow to the head. Theexact cause of death has not been released.   ``There is evidence of drug use and abuse prevalent throughoutthis case. Dawson's actions were not racially motivated,'' saidTurck. Dawson was a suspect in the case from the beginning, he said.   Investigators speculated the letters ``KKK'' may have beencarved onto the victim after she was killed.   Also charged in the case is a transient and former mentalpatient who is accused of sexually abusing the victim's corpse.Joseph Kiernan, 41, was not considered a suspect in the death,although police said they believe he may have carved the initials.   Police have obtained a handwriting sample from Kiernan and areawaiting test results to determine whether it matches the writingof the person who inscribed the initials, Assistant DistrictAttorney John Prizzia said.   Miss Kithcart's father has said his daughter was a drug abuser.``I'm almost positive it was a drug rub,'' Eugene Kithcart saidlast week.   Kingston is located about 25 miles north of Wappingers Falls, onthe opposite shore of the Hudson River. Last November, 16-year-oldTawana Brawley of Wappingers Falls was found with the letters``KKK'' and racial epithets scrawled in a charcoal-like substanceon her skin after she was missing for four days.   She later said she had been abducted and raped by a group ofwhite men, but she and her family have refused to cooperate with astate investigation.</TEXT></DOC>
