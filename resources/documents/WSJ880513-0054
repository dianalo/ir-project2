The offer for the catalog-showroom operator was to have expired at 12:01 a.m. today.    About 721,000 of Jewelcor's estimated 3,261,000 common shares have been tendered under the offer, the company said. The investor group, S.H. Holdings Inc., includes Seymour Holtzman, Jewelcor's president. The group already holds about a 26% stake in the company.    As previously reported, Wilkes-Barre, Pa.-based Jewelcor agreed to be acquired by the group last month for $19 a share. If all the shares the group doesn't already own are tendered and purchased, the transaction would have an indicated value of about $46 million.    Yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Jewelcor shares closed at $18.875, up 12.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
