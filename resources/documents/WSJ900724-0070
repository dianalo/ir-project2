The prophets from UCLA's managementschool, where market theory rules, see the sun starting toset.   That may seem surprising, but methodology more thanideology illuminates the Whither Los Angeles debate. It's amatter of economic science vs. street sense.</LP><TEXT>   Most economists aren't going as far as the UCLAForecasting Group in espying the brink of recession. Butclearly layoffs are rolling through 360,000 civilianaerospace jobs in the state. Most of these are in the LosAngeles region, although the San Jose area actually has ahigher concentration. McKinsey andamp; Co.'s consultants see atleast a quarter of this work force gone by the end of thePentagon downsizing. That's the same proportion as was acedin the cutbacks that wracked Southern California 20 yearsago.   The &quot;multiplier&quot; effect on other employment is projectedto extend the current damage. UCLA finds constructionactivity already falling through the floor. It detects nosource of strength in any sector. (Another straw in thewestern wind: demand for temporary office workers, a goodmodern barometer, has been down for months.) The aerospacebust could be a catalyst for widespread movement away fromthe congestion, crime and costs of a spent-out metropolis.   Enter Joel Kotkin, who left Long Island, N.Y., in theearly '70s and old-line leftism by the '80s to emerge as aguru of pluralist prosperity in Los Angeles. An &quot;ethnicallyconscious&quot; Jew who insinuates himself into the immigrantneighborhoods and businesses of his adopted hometown, he is aprolific writer, fellow of a Denver-based outfit called theCenter for the New West and a seeming encyclopedia on thepeople and commerce of the new LA.   The trained experts can't fathom what's going on at groundlevel, says Mr. Kotkin, 37. &quot;I can think circles around thePh.D.s in economics, at least on this stuff.&quot; The historyB.A. sees an unremitting rush of talent, wealth and energy tothe opportunity of this place in the sun. It isn't justforeigners, he says: domestic in-migration, especially ofyoung white men, remains strong. But he agrees with theUCLAns that one breed of Californian, for whom aerospace &quot;wasGeneral Motors transplanted,&quot; is in eclipse.   &quot;A lot of people came to California from the Midwestlooking for paradise, and they found the center of the worldinstead,&quot; he says. With their plants closing they will notwish to stay. &quot;There are people who are culturally displacedin LA. A lot of the unhappiness you hear is Ozzie and Harrietwaking up one morning and finding out that their next-doorneighbor's wife is wearing a sari and the guy across thestreet is Filipino.&quot; Eight people may be living as anextended family, noisily celebrating odd holidays andevincing a busyness that rankles the settled.   At work, a 50-year-old defense engineer may have no futurehere if he's &quot;used to spending all that needs to be spent toget a perfect specification and he can't get into acommercial mentality,&quot; says Mr. Kotkin. Or if he has aproblem reporting to, say, a young Vietnamese boss at thesort of specialized Randamp;D firms that will want to stay in theLos Angeles of tomorrow.   So some in aerospace will move, at least to the farreaches of the urban sprawl. But the economy will notimplode, Mr. Kotkin thinks. Each time the Pentagon shrankafter wars, in the '40s, '50s and '60s, he says, LA'sdownfall was falsely assumed, because &quot;people in the Eastthink Southern Californians are a bunch of idiots and thatthe only reason they could be any good is that the federalgovernment is shooting them full of steroids.&quot;   But entrepreneurial industrialists picked up the slack.Initially they were Howard Hughes and associate CharlesThornton (later of Litton Industries). By the '70s the hugeinflux of foreign investment and people had begun. Unsuitedto military work during its heyday because of securitystrictures, these outsiders aren't hurting today.   &quot;The federal government is becoming more irrelevant to theeconomy,&quot; Mr. Kotkin maintains, citing the accompanyingchart. (See accompanying illustration -- WSJ July 24, 1990)Indeed, Pentagon work is a bigger factor in the Washington,D.C., area and New England than on the West Coast.   Small manufacturing is king in Southern California. Agarment industry rivaling New York's has sprung up. Worldtrade and the financing that underwrites it have blossomed.There's ever-expanding &quot;Hollywood,&quot; of course. And theunmeasurable: &quot;God knows what percentage of the income inEast LA {the Latino center} is being made in the undergroundeconomy,&quot; he says. &quot;I don't mean drug dealing -- constructionwork, gardeners, people bringing in produce and selling itoff a truck.&quot; Mr. Kotkin likens the situation to authorHernando de Soto's Peru. And he suggests this measure ofsuccess: Homes in East LA, not long ago considered a blightedbarrio, sell for three times what they'd cost in Compton, alargely black suburb.   &quot;Half the economy seems to be operating in some languageother than English,&quot; exaggerates Mr. Kotkin. &quot;And the moneyis coming from someplace else.&quot; Along with the Chinesediaspora, he says, the hottest source is ethnic Indians fromHong Kong, but they're cooling their heels. &quot;They're comingin and buying stuff in Cerritos,&quot; a middle-class multiethnicarea. &quot;If it doesn't make a lot of money in five years,that's fine. They got their money out of Hong Kong. Cerritosisn't going to be taken over by the communist Chinese.&quot;   With all of its lawyers, regulators and outright thieves,Southern California is no easy pickings for small business,he acknowledges. But to the immigrant, &quot;the hassles areinfinitely less than dealing with the Mexican bureaucracy, orhaving to drive around in a {lousy} car so you don't getkidnapped in Taipei, or worrying about Li Peng marching intotown tomorrow.&quot;   Northern Mexico's growing vibrancy will change the picturefurther. It is already leading to a surge in middle-classMexican tourism in Southern California, Mr. Kotkin says. Andthe &quot;maquiladora&quot; assembly plants across the border areproving a market for such components as specialty plasticsmade in the LA area.   If New York City of the early 1900s was the model of theLA dynamo, doesn't that augur ill? Mr. Kotkin, whosegrandfather ran vaudeville theaters in Brooklyn, says no. NewYork's economy choked on corporatization and from a virtualshut-off of immigration from 1924-65. Los Angeles isatomistic and, the border laws notwithstanding, maintains avital inflow.   Mr. Kotkin isn't oblivious to the problems thatlarge-scale immigration can bring. He wants government todeal with them, which is one reason he still considershimself a liberal. But whatever his ideology, his layman'seconomics may gauge better than sophisticated models thehealth of America's second city. If anything was learned fromthe failed forecasting of the 1980s, it's that global shiftsof capital, both money and human, count for more than manyrealized.</TEXT></DOC>
