Schneider, a French industrial holding company, said it changed its offer in an effort to maintain &quot;clarity and fairness in the market&quot; following last week's decision by Framatome S.A. to revise its bid. Framatome, a French builder of nuclear reactors, now is seeking all of Telemecanique, in contrast to its earlier partial bid, and is offering 4,500 francs a share, down from 5,800 francs. Framatome has the support of Telemecanique empolyees.    Telemecanique's stock is suspended at 5,505 francs on Paris's stock exchange.    Schneider's new bid values all of the target company at 8.5 billion francs ($1.48 billion); Framatome's offer values it at 7.08 billion francs. But because Schneider already holds about 24.5% of Telemecanique, it would have to spend 6.43 billion francs for the remaining stock. </TEXT></DOC>
