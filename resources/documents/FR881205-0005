No claim,in the absence of specific statutory authorization, will be made directlyagainst a member or employee, or his or her dependents for injuries sustainedto himself or herself through acts of simple negligence, gross negligence,or willful misconduct.(3) <T3>Government contractors.</T3> Claims, the cost or expense of which maybe reimbursable by the United States under the terms of a contract, willnot be asserted against a contractor without the prior approval of USARCS.Such claims will be investigated and the report thereof, which will includecitation to the specific contract clauses involved and recommendationsregarding assertion will be forwarded through command channels to Commander,USARCS.(4) <T3>Foreign persons.</T3> Claims within the scope of andSection;andSection;537.21through 537.24 against foreign prospective defendants will be investigated,processed, and asserted without regard to the nationality of the prospectivedefendant, unless such action is precluded by treaty or international agreement.Claims against an international organization, or foreign government, willbe investigated and reports thereof, together with recommendations regardingassertion and enforcement, will be forwarded through command channels toCommander, USARCS.

If an RJA lacks authoritysufficient to settle the claim against the Government, he will coordinatehis action with that claims echelon which has the necessary authority tosettle the particular claim against the United States.(d) <T3>Claims for less than $250.</T3> Such claims need not be asserted orotherwise processed, unless the facts and circumstances surrounding theincident indicate that collection will be economically feasible (for example,a good case of liability covered by insurance) or desirable in the bestinterests of the United States.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;537.23</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Predemand Procedures. </ITAG>(a) <T3>Relations with the injured party</T3>_(1) <T3>Advice.</T3> The injured party, or, in appropriate cases, his guardian,next-of-kin, personal representative, or the executor or administratorof his estate, will be advised of the following: (i) That under the Act of September 25, 1962 (76 Stat. 593, 42 U.S.C. 2651-3,the United States may be entitled to recover the reasonable value of medicalcare furnished or to be furnished him in the future from the person orpersons who injured him, or who were otherwise responsible for his injuryor disease; and(ii) That if he is otherwise entitled to legal assistance under AR 27-3,he should seek guidance from a legal assistance officer regarding any claimhe may have for personal injury; and (iii) That he is required to cooperate in the prosecution of all actionsof the United States against the person or persons who injured him; and(iv) That he is required to furnish a complete statement regarding thefacts and circumstances surrounding the incident which resulted in theinjury or disease; and (v) That he is required to furnish information concerning any legal actionbrought or to be brought by or against the prospective defendant, or tofurnish the name and address of the attorney representing him; and(vi) That he should not execute a release or settle any claim which hemay have as a result of his injury without first notifying the RJA.(2) <T3>Statement. </T3>A written statement will be obtained from the injuredparty, or his representative, in which he acknowledges receipt of the advicein paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and provides the information requiredby paragraphs (a)(1) (iv) and (v) of this section. If the injured partyor representative fails or refuses to furnish necessary information orcooperation, the originator of the notification of potential claims maybe requested to withhold records as to medical history, diagnoses, findings,and treatment, from the injured party or anyone acting on his behalf pendingcompliance with the requirements in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Mererefusal by the injured party or his representative to include the Government'sclaim in his claim is not sufficient basis, by itself, for this action.(b) <T3>Determination and assertion</T3>_(1) <T3>Liability. </T3>The RJA will review all the evidence including anyclaims officer's report of investigation and, after assuring completenessof the file, will make a written determination as to the liability of theprospective defendant and note his reasons for such determination. (2) <T3>Value. </T3>If the RJA determines that the prospective defendant isliable, he will also ascertain the reasonable value of medical care furnishedor to be furnished to the injured party, in accordance with andSection; 537.22(a)(3)and rates established by the Office of Management and Budget. When a militarymember has been retained in a military hospital for administrative reasons,or where the patient was absent from the hospital or was in a purely convalescentstatus, the amount of the claim will be recomputed to apply the outpatientrate, if under circumstances warranting only outpatient treatment in acivilian hospital or eliminate such periods altogether if the injured partyreceived no treatment during those periods. In making these determinationsthe RJA will coordinate with the registrar or other responsible officialof the hospital or medical unit in his area of responsibility. (3) <T3>Amount. </T3>In the event of doubt concerning the extent of medicalcare furnished or to be furnished an injured party, the RJA will assertthe claim in an indefinite amount. Demand will be made in a definite amountat the earliest possible date, based on an estimate of a reasonable valueof medical care to be furnished, if appropriate.
