The 134 biggestdeadbeats bounced a total of 581 checks worth $1,000 or moreeach but didn't have to pay a penny in interest or fees. Ineffect, they were granted a loan on the float for up to fourweeks at a time.   In response to all this, House Speaker Thomas Foley toldreporters that &quot;in the future I am going to hold members ofthe bank staff accountable.&quot; The staff? What about theMembers who bounced the checks? Ah, said the Speaker, &quot;forthe moment, we're going to start everybody with a cleanslate.&quot; So there'll be no Salomonic Solution for Tom Foley.We do wonder, though, if the House is going to actually getaway with sweeping this one under its capacious rug.</LP><TEXT>   Last Wednesday, Rep. Toby Roth of Wisconsin was about tocall for a special committee to investigate Kitegate. With analacrity rarely seen on the House floor, Speaker Foley roseto pre-empt the Roth motion. He announced the end to no-feeoverdraft privileges and then declared that the issue &quot;is nowover and done with.&quot; Republican leader Bob Michel thenseconded the Speaker's thoughts, applying a bipartisan sealto any coverup. Believe it or not, some Members privatelyblame the scandal on the voters for blocking a congressionalpay raise.   Speaker Foley's action didn't satisfy several Members whoresent being tarred as deadbeats along with the House'shighfliers. Last week, they demanded that Speaker Foleyrelease the names and account records of the guilty parties.Mr. Foley refused, saying that since the bank used only thedeposits of Members the taxpayers weren't on the hook. JimCoyne, a former Member, is skeptical: &quot;I'll bet a close lookwould show the bank was somehow an extension of the U.S.Treasury.&quot;   Rumors relating to the non-bank bank were circulating inabundance among Members on the House floor last week. Memberswere talking about other Members who used the float frombounced checks to invest in short-term, interest-bearinginstruments. Others say the bank helped Members getlow-interest loans from local banks. There are tales ofindividual debts to the House Administration Committee ofthousands of dollars for catering and other services. Rep.John Boehner, an Ohio freshman, says that when the Rothmotion was about to be made he &quot;saw a look of fear in theeyes of many Members in both parties.&quot;   There is, of course, one way to calm most of the fear,dispel the rumors and clear the air: disclosure.   Speaker Foley, however, says that the records of the Housebank are private and that the public has no legitimateinterest in them. Certainly they have no legal right to them.Congress has exempted itself from the Freedom of InformationAct. But the House bank was a public institution, and clearlysome Members cashed checks there solely because they knewthey could bounce them with impunity.   Unless the majority of Members who didn't abuse the bankare allowed to clear themselves they'll remain suspect in theeyes of their constituents. The only way to put this mess torest is for the House bank to issue a full and completeaccounting of its operations. Members in both parties will beembarrassed, but the public would at least know that therubber-check affair is an individual problem and not theresult of a deeper institutional corruption.</TEXT></DOC>
