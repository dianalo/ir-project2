(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Firefighters aided by cool, damp weathergained the upper hand Wednesday over two forest fires thatblackened more than 12 square miles of dry woods and grasslands anddestroyed 75 homes.   Up to 300 people were evacuated from their homes, most of themalong the Au Sable River, after the fires broke out Tuesday in asparsely populated section of the northern Lower Peninsula,authorities said.   The only known casualty was a firefighter treated for smokeinhalation, said Scott Heather, assistant regional forest managerwith the state Department of Natural Resources.   The larger fire began five miles east of Grayling. Fanned by20-mph gusts, it burned an 8-by-1{-mile swath of woods andgrassland and destroyed 66 houses and more than 30 other structuressuch as shacks and garages, Heather said.   ``We feel at this point we've got the fire 75 percentcontrolled,'' he said. ``The weather conditions are with us; it'scool and damp. We don't anticipate any further problem.''   Flames persisted in a mainly marshy area, where it was difficultto bring in firefighting equipment, Heather said.   The second fire broke out 10 miles to the south, in southernCrawford and northern Roscommon counties.   It consumed 450 acres and nine homes and five other structuresbefore being brought under control early Wednesday with help from aquarter-inch of rain that fell overnight, Heather said.   Light rain continued Wednesday as four National Guardhelicopters dumped 185-gallon buckets of water on flames.   About 30 evacuees spent Tuesday night at nearby Camp Grayling, aMichigan National Guard base. About 100 turned up at a Red Crosscenter Wednesday to obtain warm clothing and instructions forseeking financial help.   ``This one little old lady in particular struck me,'' saidCrawford County Sheriff's Deputy Heide Miller, who was meetingevacuees at the door. ``She had apparently got word her house wasgone. She was in shock.''   The cause of the fires remained under investigation, Heathersaid. Other Department of Natural Resources officials said theysuspected a trash fire had gotten out of hand.   Most of the northern Lower Peninsula went 13 days without anyrain and longer than that without a heavy downpour, saidmeteorologist Chuck Defever of the National Weather Service's AnnArbor office. In addition, snow melted early this year, allowingundergrowth to become very dry.   Gov. James Blanchard and department Director David Hales arrivedto survey the damage.   Up to 150 department and local firefighters battled the blazesat their peak late Tuesday, but only about 75 remained Wednesdayafternoon, Heather said.   Miller said most residents would find out Wednesday eveningwhether their homes were among the few saved, when firefightersexpected to remove road barricades.   ``There will be a lot of broken hearts,'' said Bill Mahalak,acting regional forest manager with the Department of NaturalResources.   The area's year-round population is relatively sparse, but growswhen cabin owners visit for the summer and fall, drawn by deer orbear hunting and trout fishing along the Au Sable River.   Norbert Szkotnicki said he snuck past police barricades to checkon his home along the river. He found part of it burning.   ``I got a chain saw and cut off a (burning) corner of thecabin,'' he said. Firefighters then arrived and doused the house,saving it.   ``My family has been here 110 years. My grandfather built thathouse,'' he said. ``I wasn't going to lose it.''</TEXT></DOC>
