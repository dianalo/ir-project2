(``Amex''), and theChicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'') (collectively ``exchanges''),respectively, submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC''or ``Commission''), pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities ExchangeAct of 1934 (``Act''),\1\<NOTE/> and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,\2\<NOTE/> proposed rule changes to list for trading market basket productsdesignated as index participations (``IPs''). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1982). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\17 CFR 240.19b-4 (1988).

Background and Description of the Products </ITAG>A. Terms of the Contracts An IP is a present interest in the current value of a portfolio of stocks.IPs are of indefinite duration, and entitle holders to cash payments equivalentto a proportionate share of any regular cash dividends paid on the componentstocks of the underlying equity portfolio. Investors buying and sellingIPs can realize profits or limit losses on their investment by enteringinto an offsetting sale or purchase of an IP in a closing transaction andthereby receive or make payment of the difference between the cost of theopening and closing transactions. Alternatively, investors purchasing IPsmay elect instead to realize profits or limit losses on their investmentthrough exercising a cash-out privilege\5\<NOTE/> which is available, depending on the IP, on a daily, quarterly,or a semi-annual basis. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\<T3>See </T3>discussion on p. 6 <T3>infra.</T3> The dates on which IPs purchasers may obtain the full index value uponexercise of the cash-out privilege are designated as cash-out times. Excludingthe Phlx's daily cash-out alternative, the cash-out time for each quarteror semi-annual period, depending on the IP, will be determined and madepublic by each Exchange before the beginning of such period. The Phlx IP, called the Cash Index Participation (``CIP''), permits holdersto exercise the cash-out feature on a daily basis in addition to the designatedquarterly cash-out time.\6\<NOTE/> A CIP holder that exercises the cash-out feature on any dayother than the designated quarterly cash-out time will receive 99.5% ofthe underlying portfolio's value. the Phlx notes that the .5% differentialsubtracted from the index value received by such CIP holders is a fee thatreflects the substantial benefit to CIP holders of daily cash-out, andthat CIP holders may avoid the discount by closing out their positionsfor cash in the market or by cashing out at a regular quarterly cash-outdate. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\The CIP, when first proposed by the Phlx, provided fora quarterly cash-out only. Subsequently, on September 26 and October 11,1988, the Phlx submited Amendments Nos. 2 and 3, respectively to its proposedrule change. In general, these amendments would permit CIP holders to exercisethe cash-out feature on a daily as well as quarterly basis. To exercisethe daily cash-out feature an IP holder must submit notice of this exerciseby 4:15 p.m. The IP holder would receive a cash payment equal to 99.5%of the index value as of the close of business the following day. The Phlxhas tentatively determined to establish the quarterly cash-out time tocoincide with the expiration of the leading stock index futures contracts[<T3>i.e. </T3>the opening of trading on the third Friday of March, June,September, and December (``Expiration Friday'')]. <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26174 (October 13, 1988),53 FR 40814. The Amex product is termed the Equity Index Participation (``EIP''). EIPs,as originally proposed by the Amex, enabled purchasers to exercise a cash-outprivilege on a quarterly basis. On October 27, 1988, the Amex submittedan amendment to permit EIP holders to receive either cash or physical deliveryof shares of the component stocks of the Sandamp;P 500 Index and the MajorMarket Index under specified circumstances.\7\<NOTE/> More specifically, the holder of one or more delivery units\8\<NOTE/> that has not chosen to exercise the cash-out privilege hasthe right to obtain on each delivery time, which coincides with the quarterlycash-out time, the physical delivery of the proportionate number of sharesof each stock comprising the underlying index, subject to certain conditions.A delivery fee established by the Amex will be charged to EIP holders takingphysical delivery of the component stocks. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26243 (November 2, 1988),53 FR 45407. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ A delivery unit is defined as the minimum number, as specifiedby the Amex, of EIPs of a particular class that must be held in an individualaccount by a holder at the time of exercise of the delivery privilege,or that must be maintained as a short position in an equivalent accountby a person who notifies OCC of a desire to make physical delivery of securitiesto a holder if assigned an exercise. The Amex has tentatively establishedthe delivery unit as 50,000 EIPs per unit for the Sandamp;P 500 Index and25,000 EIPs per unit for the XMI. The Amex believes that permitting physicaldelivery of units below these levels would be impractical because of theminute number of shares of individual stocks that would be deliverable.If the Amex intends to modify the minimum number of EIPs that constitutea delivery unit, then the exchange must submit a separate proposed rulechange for Commission approval. Under the Amex proposal, exercise notices requesting physical deliveryof one or more delivery units will be assigned first, on a random basis,to those short EIP positions that have notified the Options Clearing Corporation(``OCC'') of a desire to make physical delivery. If the number of deliveryunits for which holders have requested physical delivery exceeds the numberof units made available for delivery by persons with short EIP positions,then an Amex-designated physical delivery facilitator will assume responsibilityfor delivering the physical shares with respect to such excess number ofunits.\9\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ The Amex's Amendment No. 2 to its EIP filing noted thatthe physical delivery facilitator could deliver shares out of inventory,buy shares at the opening on the cash-out date, or borrow shares. However,in order to ameliorate any concerns regarding the facilitator's advanceknowledge of physical delivery unit imbalances, the Amex submitted an additionalamendment under which the facilitator may satisfy such imbalances onlyby delivering component shares purchased at the opening on the cash-outdate. This facilitator will be compensated out of proceeds received fromshorts who have been assigned exercise notices. Initially, the Amex contemplatesdesignating only one facilitator per EIP class and notes the facilitatormay be the specialist unit for that class of EIPs. <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26355 (December 13, 1988),53 FR 51181. The CBOE product, called the Value of Index Participation (``VIP''), differsfrom both the Phlx CIP and the Amex EIP in that it allows VIP sellers,as well as purchasers, to exercise a cash-out privilege on a semi-annualbasis. A person with a short VIP position desiring to exercise the cash-outprivilege originally was required to pay a premium of 1% of the index'svalue. The CBOE eliminated this charge, however, in an amendment filedon November 1, 1988.\10\<NOTE/> The Exchange believes that the existence of a cash-out privilegefor holders of both long and short positions will cause the price of VIPsto trade more closely to the value of the underlying portfolio becauseit will allow a hedged short VIP holder an alternative to reversing hisposition by purchasing the VIP at the current market price and sellingthe underlying equities. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26257 (November 7, 1988),53 FR 45833. This amendment also changed the cash-out feature from a quarterlyto a semi-annual cycle. Notice of exercise of the IP cash-out privilege must be provided by anIP purchaser on or before a time specified and made public by the Exchangeon which the IP is traded. The exchanges have determined to establish andmake public the cut-off time for the submission of notices of exerciseof an IP cash-out privilege before the beginning of each quarterly or semi-annualcash-out time. At the present time, the exchanges have established an exercisecut-off time of the close of trading on the day before the quarterly orsemi-annual cash-out time (<T3>i.e. </T3>4:15 p.m. on the Thursday before the quarterly or semi-annualcash-out time).\11\<NOTE/> An exercise notice may be tendered to the OCC only by theOCC clearing member in whose account the IP is carried. Upon exercise ofthe quarterly or semi-annual cash-out privilege an IP purchaser may obtainat the cash-out time the IP index value based on the opening trades ofthe portfolio's component stocks on the next day.\12\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ If the exchanges intend to modify the exercise cut-offtime they must submit separate proposed rule changes for Commission approvalpursuant to section 19(b)(2). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ A CIP holder exercising the daily cash-out privilegeon a day other than the quarterly cash-out time receives the value of theportfolio at the close of the next trading day, less the .5 percent exercisefee described above.Pursuant to the exchanges' proposed rules, each member organization willestablish fixed procedures for the allocation of IP exercise notices assignedto a short (or long also in the case of CBOE VIPs) position in IPs in suchmember organization's customers' accounts. Such allocation shall be madeon either a ``first-in, first-out'' basis, automated random selection basisthat has been approved by the exchanges, or on a manual random selectionbasis. Each member organization will inform its customers in writing ofthe method it uses to allocate exercise notices to its customers' accounts,explaining its manner of operation and the consequences of that system.Pursuant to the exchanges' proposed rules, all bids and offers made onthe trading floor for IPs will be deemed to be for one unit of tradingunless a specified greater number of IPs is expressed. A bid or offer formore than a unit of trading of IPs will be deemed to be for the amountthereof or a smaller number of units of trading of IPs. The unit of tradingin IPs shall be 100 IPs unless otherwise designated by the Exchange.\13\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\13\ If the exchanges intend to modify the unit of tradingfrom 100 IPs they must submit separate proposed rule changes for Commissionapproval. The exchanges have reserved the right, in the event of extreme IP tradinginactivity or under exceptional circumstances, to require that purchasersand sellers settle their IP contracts at the closing index value determinedby a designated cash-out time, upon one year's prior notice to the public.B. Portfolios Underlying the Proposed Index Participations <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Composition, Calculation and Adjustment </ITAG>The exchanges contemplate trading IPs on a variety of underlying portfolios,most of which are relied upon as well-established and widely-disseminatedmarket indicators or market segment indicators, and some of which are new.The Phlx has designated two underlying portfolios for CIP trading: a broad-basedportfolio designated by the Exchange (``Blue Chip'' Index) and the Standardandamp; Poors 500 (``Sandamp;P'' 500) portfolio.\14\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\14\ Originally, the Phlx proposed trading a Stock MarketCIP that was based on a 100 stock portfolio developed by the Exchange andwas designed to track closely with the Sandamp;P 500. On August 23, 1988,the Phlx submitted Amendment No. 1 to the filing in which it withdrew itsproposed Stock Market CIP and indicated that it would trade a Sandamp;P 500CIP in its place. <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26058 (September 2, 1988),53 FR 35247. The Blue Chip CIP is an IP based on a price-weighted portfolio composedof 25 highly capitalized listed common stock issues representing primarilyindustrial corporations, and which is designed to replicate the performanceof the Dow Jones Industrial Average (``DJIA''). Each Blue Chip CIP willrepresent \1/100\ (the multiplier) times the value of the portfolio, andeach Sandamp;P 500 CIP \15\<NOTE/> will represent \1/10\ (the multiplier) times the value ofthe portfolio. The standard unit of trading in such CIPs will be 100 CIPs,and bids and offers will be expressed in decimals. The Exchange expectsto establish a starting Blue Chip CIP portfolio value of approximately2000, so that each Blue Chip CIP would be priced at approximately $20.00,and each Blue Chip CIP trading unit would be priced at approximately $2,000.The value of the portfolio will be adjusted to account for stock splits,stock dividends, and extraordinary cash dividends. The value of the portfoliowill not be adjusted for regular cash dividends paid out to CIP holders.If the character of any stock in the portfolio materially and substantiallychanges on the account of delisting, merger, acquisition, or otherwise,the Exchange will replace such stock with another stock which possessessimilar characteristics so as to retain the integrity and representativenessof the portfolio. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\15\ <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 19907 (June 24, 1983),48 FR 30814 for a detailed description of the Sandamp;P 500 Stock Index.As of December 6, 1988, the closing index value for the Sandamp;P 500 was277.58. Thus, each Sandamp;P 500 CIP would be priced at $27.75, and eachSandamp;P 500 trading unit would be priced at $2,775. The Amex EIPs will be based on the Major Market Index (``XMI'') \16\<NOTE/> and the Sandamp;P 500.\17\<NOTE/> The XMI is a broad-based price-weighted portfolio developedby the Amex, and is comprised of 20 highly capitalized issuers. Each XMIEIP will represent \1/10\ (the multiplier) times the portfolio's value,\18\<NOTE/> and the standard unit of trading in such EIPs will be 100EIPs. Bids and offers for EIPs will be quoted in decimals. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\16\ <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 19610 (March 17, 1983),48 FR 12486; 19709 (April 27, 1983), 48 FR 20179 for a detailed descriptionof the XMI. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\17\ The Exchange originally proposed to trade EIPs on theXMI and the Institutional Index (``XII''). On July 21, 1988, however, theExchange submitted to the Commission Amendment No. 1 to File No. SR-Amex-88-10to trade EIPs on the Sandamp;P 500 rather than on the XII. <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 25942 (July 25, 1988),53 FR 28929. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\18\ As of December 6, 1988 the closing index value for theXMI was approximately 423. Thus, each XMI EIP would be priced at $42.30,and each XMI EIP trading unit would be priced at $4,230. The CBOE VIPs are based on the capitalization-weighted CBOE 50 and CBOE250 portfolios \19\<NOTE/> developed and maintained by the Exchange, and the Sandamp;P500 Index, calculated and maintained by Standard and Poor's Corporation.Each CBOE VIP will represent \1/10\ (the Index multiplier) times the Indexvalue,\20\<NOTE/> and the standard unit of trading will be 100 VIPs. Bids andoffers for VIPs will be quoted in fractions of \1/8\ of a point. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\19\ <T3>See </T3>Letter from Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC to Dr. PaulaTosini, Director, Division of Economic Analysis, CFTC, dated April 22,1988 for a detailed description of both the underlying CBOE 50 and CBOE250 portfolios. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\20\ As of December 6, 1988 the closing value for the CBOE250 was approximately 248. Thus, each CBOE 250 VIP would be priced at $24.80,and each CBOE VIP trading unit would be priced at $2,480.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Publication</ITAG>Publication of the values underlying the IPs will occur at two levels.\2\\1\<NOTE/> First, the exchanges will make public the component portfoliosthey use for calculating the value of their participations. This is necessaryto provide market professionals, institutions, and other public investorsa basis for relating the value of these participations to their own stockpositions, and for maximizing the utility of the participations. The Phlx,Amex, and CBOE currently publicize the means by which they compute valuesof the portfolios underlying their participations (<T3>i.e.</T3> summation of share prices divided by a specific divisor,times the multiplier).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\1\ Publication and dissemination of the values of theportfolios underlying IPs will help to ensure the maintenance of a fairand orderly market in the product consistent with the goals of Section11A(a)(1) of the Act and to reduce the possibility of fraudulent or manipulativetrading involving the IPs. <T3>See</T3> 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5) (1982).Second, in addition to the real-time computation of underlying portfoliovalues that will be the subject of index participation trading, those valueswill be widely disseminated. Because products related to the portfoliosunderlying the Amex EIP, the CBOE VIP, and the Phlx Sandamp;P 500 CIP previouslyhave been approved for trading, those values are already widely disseminated.Additionally, the Phlx has retained Bridge Data, Inc. to compute and performall necessary maintenance of the Blue Chip CIP. Pursuant to Phlx Rule 1003B,updated underlying portfolio values will be disseminated and displayedby means of primary market prints reported over the Consolidated Last SaleReporting System and the facilities of the Options Price Reporting Authority.The value of the underlying portfolios will also be available on broker-dealerinterrogation devices to subscribers of the CIPs information.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Comments Received</ITAG>The Commission received 25 comment letters in response to its requestsfor comments on the Phlx, Amex, and CBOE proposed rule changes. Fifteenof the twenty-five comment letters were submitted on behalf of the CommodityFutures Trading Commission (``CFTC''), the Chicago Board of Trade (``CBT''),or the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (``CME''). These letters expressed thebelief that the IPs are futures, and therefore that the Commission lacksjurisdiction to approve the proposed rule changes.\2\\2\<NOTE/> In response to these futures industry comment letters theCommission received letters from the Phlx and CBOE, and a comment letterfrom the Amex, which included opinions of their respective legal counsels,stating that IPs are securities and therefore subject to SEC jurisdiction.\2\\3\<NOTE/> Two letters came from the Phlx and Amex that addressed issuesrelated to timing of Commission action on IPs.\2\\4\<NOTE/> The Commission also received a letter from the Phlx commentingon Amex Amendment No. 2 to its EIP filing providing for physical delivery,\2\\5\<NOTE/> a letter from the Amex responding to this Phlx comment letter,\2\\6\<NOTE/> and letters from three investors, two expressing supportfor immediate approval of CIPs \2\\7\<NOTE/> and one suggesting that EIPs are an unnecessary investmenttool.\2\\8\<NOTE/> In addition, the Commission received a letter from the InvestmentCompany Institute (``ICI'') arguing that IPs are investment company sharesand thus must receive relief from the Investment Company Act of 1940 \2\\9\<NOTE/> before they may be traded on a national securities exchange.\3\\0\<NOTE/> Subsequent to the Commission's consideration of the proposedIPs during an open meeting on March 14, 1989, the Commission received aletter on behalf of the ICI arguing that the issuance and trading of IPscreate investment companies. In particular, the ICI claimed that the individualsholding long IP positions and short IP positions each constitute an ``issuer''under the statutory definition of that term because they are an ``organizedgroup of persons.'' \3\\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\2\ <T3>See </T3>Letters to Jonathan G.

Miles, Attorney, Fried, Frank, Harris,Shriver andamp; Jacobson on behalf of the ICI, to David S. Ruder <T3>et al</T3>., Chairman, SEC, dated March 31, 1989. The Commission, inits discretion, determined to consider this comment. 17 CFR 202.6(b).A. <T3>Futures Industry Letters</T3>In general, the CFTC, the CBT, and the CME (``futures commentators'') arguethat the Commission lacks jurisdiction to authorize IP trading throughapproval of the Exchanges' proposed rule changes because an IP does notconstitute a ``security'' as defined in seciton 3(a)(10) of the Act.\3\\2\<NOTE/> In particular, the futures commentators argue that the economicfunction and purpose of IPs are characteristic of stock index futures ratherthan stock or index options, and that IPs are therefore subject to theexclusive jurisdiction of the CFTC pursuant to section 2(a)(1)(B) of theCommodity Exchange Act (``CEA'').<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\2\ 15 U.S.C. 78(c)(1)(j) (1982).The futures commentators suggest several reasons to categorize IPs as stockindex futures. First, they argue that both the purchaser and seller ofan IP contract have entered into a transaction that may be cashed out ata future date at a price based upon the difference between the price establishedat the initiation of the contract and some undetermined future price. Second,with the exception of the Amex EIP, the IP contract provides for cash settlementonly. Third, while an IP long is entitled to hold his position indefinitely,they argue that essentially the contract has a quarterly expiration_identicalto the cycle now applicable for similar futures contracts_due to the quarterlycash-out feature. The futures commentators suggest that this feature issynonymous with an ``undated futures market contract.'' They suggest furtherthat the outcome of effective competition will be that an IP long actuallywill pay a commission to ``roll over'' his position, at the time he entersinto an IP contract, in the form of higher IP prices. Fourth, there isnot apparent option premium paid by an IP long.The CME, specifically, suggests that, although IPs include two featuresthat may not be immediately recognized as standard features of futurescontracts, those features serve the economic equivalent of futures characteristics.\3\\3\<NOTE/> First, the short will be required to pay to the long cashpayments equivalent to a proportionate share of any regular cash dividendspaid on the component stocks of the underlying index. The CME suggeststhat the concept of a cash payment from the short to the long, relatedto measured or theoretical shrinkages in the value of the underlying product,is a feature also found in futures contracts. Second, IPs afford longsthe right to select the time at which shorts will be compelled to makecash delivery. The CME notes that this is a standard feature of most physicalcommodity based futures contracts, and that a futures contract holder generallyhas a far wider range of options (<T3>e.g.,</T3> the ability to control the exact date, time, and place ofthe delivery of the commodity to the long).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\3\ <T3>See </T3>1st CME Letter at 2-3.The Phlx, CBOE, and Amex (the ``exchanges'') argue that IPs should be viewedas securities as defined in section 3(a)(10) of the Act.\3\\4\<NOTE/> In general, the Phlx and CBOE base their argument on <T3>SEC </T3>v.<T3> C.M. Joiner Leasing Corp.\3\\5\</T3><NOTE/> in which the Supreme Court emphasized the economic functionof instruments in determining whether they constituted securities.\3\\6\<NOTE/> Specifically, the Phlx argues that although IPs do not possessall of the familiar characteristics of common stock as described in <T3>Landreth Timber Co. </T3>v.<T3> Landreth \3\\7\</T3><NOTE/> an IP does possess most of the characteristics of stock,and purchases and sales of an IP are intended to replicate the economicsubstance of purchases and sales of an equivalent amount of the underlyingstocks.\3\\8\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\4\ <T3>See generally</T3> Letter from William W.

The Amex arguesthat an IP is a security because it is: (1) a call or option on any securityor group or index of securities; (2) a certificate of interest or participationin stock; and (3) a right to purchase stock.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\7\ 471 U.S. 681, 686-87 (1985). <T3>See </T3>discussion on pp. 28-29 <T3>infra.</T3><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\8\ <T3>See</T3> Cadwalader letter, <T3>supra</T3> note 34, at 5.First, the exchanges argue that IPs entitle holders to receive on a quarterlybasis cash payments equivalent to the regular cash dividends declared onthe component stocks of the underlying index. Second, the Phlx argues thatan IP purchaser will have the ability to pledge or hypothecate his interestin the IP. For example, as a typical provision of customer agreements witha brokerage firm, an investor normally will pledge or hypothecate his interestin the IP, including profits and dividends, as security to the broker forany indebtedness arising in connection with his account or any other indebtednessto the broker. Third, the Phlx argues that IPs will be freely transferablein exchange transactions; thus, IPs will be negotiable in the same senseas exchange-traded equities and equity and non-equity securities options.Fourth, the exchanges argue that IPs will have the capacity to appreciatein value as the securities comprising the underlying portfolio increasein value.In addition, the Phlx and CBOE assert that, although the purchase and saleof an IP does not constitute the purchase and sale of the underlying sharesof stock, the economic substance of transactions in the IP leads to theconclusion that the IP should be viewed as stock for purposes of the definitionof security. An IP purchaser or seller will have similar risks and obligationsas a person long or short stock. The Phlx notes further that, to the extentthese risks and obligations differ from those associated with stock, theyresemble a stock index option because of the availability of a cash-outprivilege, and because IPs would be issued by the OCC rather than a corporation.Moreover, the Phlx argues that the cash settlement feature of IPs shouldnot lead to the conclusion that IPs are more akin to stock index futuresthan to securities as defined under section 3(a)(10) of the Act. The Phlxsuggests that in amending the definition of the term ``security'' to include``any put, call, straddle, option, or privilege on any security * * * orgroup or index of securities (including any interest therein or based onthe value thereof) * * * '' Congress explicitly recognized that productswhich function economically as securities are themselves securities, althoughthey are cash-settled based on the value of underlying securities or indexes.The Phlx and CBOE argue that IPs are securities because, in addition topossessing the characteristics of stock, IPs may be classified as ``aninstrument commonly known as a security.'' In making this determinationthe Phlx and CBOE rely on the majority view in <T3>Landreth</T3> that the reasonable expectation of investors that theyare purchasing securities subject to the securities laws is of particularsignificance in determining whether an instrument bearing only some ofthe traditional characteristics of a type of security enumerated in Section3(a)(10) is a security.\3\\9\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\9\ <T3>Infra</T3> note 46. The exchanges suggest that, even if an IP may be considered a commodityunder the CEA definition, it is not a ``contract of sale for future delivery''for purposes of that Act. In this regard, the exchanges argue that althoughIPs may possess certain elements characteristic of futures contracts [<T3>e.g., </T3>standardized terms and the ability of investors to realizeprofits or limit losses through entry into offsetting sales or purchasesand payment of the difference between the purchase (sale) price and theprice at which the closing transaction is effected] they lack the mostsignificant element for CEA purposes_the element of futurity.The exchanges assert that, unlike stock index futures contracts, a purchaseor sale of an IP does not entail a commitment by an investor to buy orsell the value of the underlying index at some time in the future. Theexchanges argue that a purchase or sale of the IP involves an actual purchaseor sale of the current value of the underlying index, similar to an actualtransfer of ownership of the underlying stocks.\4\\0\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\0\ The exchanges note that when an IP is purchased 100%of the instrument's value must be paid. In this regard, even if an IP weremargined, an IP purchaser would have to contribute 50% of the transaction'svalue and convince a lender to loan the remaining 50%.In addition, the exchanges note that IPs have other characteristics thatdiffer from futures contracts. First, unlike futures contracts that arelisted for trading in different contract months, IPs have a perpetual existencewith no fixed expiration date. Second, the IP gives the purchaser a cash-outprivilege and the right to receive on a quarterly basis cash payments equivalentto a proportionate share of any regular cash dividends paid on the componentstocks of the underlying portfolio. Futures, on the other hand, requiresettlement upon expiration of the contract and do not grant the right toreceive payment of dividends. Third, IPs are less highly leveraged thanstock index futures because their proposed margin requirement is 50% ofthe IP value. In addition, the exchanges note that the IP margin representsa down payment on the purchase price, rather than earnest money or a performancebond, which is the function served by the much lower levels of margin applicableto stock index futures contracts.B. Proprietary and Other ConcernsIn two comment letters regarding Amex's proposed trading of EIPs, the Phlxalleges that the Amex appropriated the CIP design to create the EIP. TheAmex filed its EIP proposal with the Commission shortly after the Phlx,and its original EIP design was virtually identical to the CIP design.The Phlx notes that it has expended a great deal of time, effort, and expensein designing and submitting this new product to the Commission for approval.For example, significant staff time and outside legal counsel fees havebeen spent in preparing the CIP to be traded. The Phlx believes that allowingthe Amex to begin trading an identical product at the initiation of CIPtrading would undercut the Phlx's efforts to develop new and innovativeproducts such as CIPs. Further, the Phlx suggests that its CIP productconstitutes protectable intellectual or creative work of pecuniary valueand is therefore protected under common law principles and statutory law.\4\\1\<NOTE/> The Phlx argues both that a vested property right ariseswith respect to its CIP and that the Amex has infringed its CIP copyrightby appropriating entire provisions constituting the vast preponderanceof the Phlx's CIP contract specifications and trading rules and presentingthem as Amex rules.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\1\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>International News Service v. Associated Press, 248U.S. 215 (1918); Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. v. Commodity Exchange, Inc.,683 F.2d 704 (2d Cir. 1982); Board of Trade of the City of <T3>Chicago </T3>v. <T3>Dow Jones andamp; Co.,</T3> 98 Ill.2d 109, 456 N.E.2d 84 (1983).For these reasons, the Phlx argues that approval of the Amex's EIP proposalwould be inconsistent with section 6(b)(5), section 6(b)(8), and section11A(a)(1)(c)(ii) of the Act. The Phlx believes that, at the least, it shouldbe provided a 12 to 18 month head start in the introduction of its IP product.In addition to the proprietary product comments, the Phlx argues that theAmex proposal is deficient in discussing the side-by-side trading concernsthat could arise from EIP trading.\42\<NOTE/> The Phlx suggests that, because Amex proposes to trade EIPson the Amex's MMI, a portfolio upon which Amex currently lists and tradesoptions, there exists the potential for significant time and place advantagesand concomitant inside market information, as well as possible conflictof interest and manipulation concerns. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\42\ The Phlx notes that the Amex proposes to trade on EIPon the XMI in addition to the XMI index option currently traded on theAmex floor. The Phlx alleges that the trading of an XMI EIP and XMI optionshould be prohibited because of informational advantages and potentialmanipulative schemes that could occur as a result of trading these twoproducts on the same floor, side-by-side. The Commission previously hasnoted that the side-by-side trading of stocks and options of those stocks,while raising regulatory concerns, may be permitted provided adequate audittrail, surveillance information and regulatory safeguards are in place.The Commission has determined that any side-by-side trading concerns (<T3>e.g.</T3>, informational advantages and potential manipulative schemes)are not present with regard to Amex's EIPs for several reasons. First,the Amex will not be trading an individual stock and an option on thatindividual stock side-by-side. Instead, the Amex will be trading an indexoption and the equivalent of a portfolio of stocks on its floor. Second,the 20 stocks that comprise the XMI, and therefore directly determine theindex's value, have a primary market on the New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE'')rather than the Amex. Consequently, any informational advantages associatedwith trading and XMI EIP on the Amex are minimal. Finally, the Commissionis satisfied that existing audit trail data, surveillance information andregulatory safeguards are sufficient to allay any side-by-side tradingconcerns. In response to Phlx's comments regarding Amex's EIPs proposal the Amexsubmitted a comment letter outlining four major rebuttals to the Phlx letter.\43\<NOTE/> First, the Amex suggests that the Commission lacks the authorityto adjudicate Phlx's property claims. In this regard, the Amex notes thatthere is no evidence that Congress intended to provide the Commission withthe authority to adjudicate property interests among competing partiesbecause Congress has enacted an elaborate statutory framework for the establishment,preservation, and protection of intellectual or creative works and establishedspecific federal agencies (<T3>e.g.</T3>, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and U.S. CopyrightOffice) to administer and enforce these laws. The Amex further notes thatthe Act provides, neither expressly nor implicitly, that competing propertyclaims among self-regulatory organizations (``SROs'') is a proper areaof Commission consideration in determining whether to approve specificrule proposals. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\43\ <T3>Supra</T3> note 24. Second, the Amex suggests that a section 19(b) proceeding is inappropriatefor adjudicating property rights because such a proceeding would involvethe Commission in an exhaustive factual investigation including, but notlimited to, a determination of which exchange actually developed the product.The Amex notes that it is prepared to document the fact that it has beenactively working for several years on the development of a market basketsecurity and has expended extensive time and resources in so doing. Third, the Amex suggests that the Phlx CIP is legally protected by neitherstatutory nor common law principles. The Amex asserts that such a tradinginstrument is a concept, and thus an idea that can not be protected underfederal statutory law. The Amex suggests that because it does not seekto utilize any underlying portfolio designed, calculated and disseminatedby Phlx as a basis for EIPs trading, and because none of the cases citedin the Phlx letter suggested that duplication or imitation of the ideaor the concept on which a commercial enterprise is based would constitutea misappropriation, the Amex has not misappropriated the Phlx product.Fourth, the Amex suggests that the ``fair competition'' mandate of section11A(a)(C)(ii) of the Act does not authorize the Commission to grant exclusivefranchises. The Amex notes that the cases cited by Phlx in support of itsproprietary rights theory recognized that the freedom to imitate and duplicateis of vital importance in a free market economy. In addition, the Amex,citing the experiences of the options markets,\44\<NOTE/> argues that Phlx's contention that innovation and commitmentto the development of new products will be stifled unless SROs are providedsome protected property interest in ideas filed with Commission is simplyerroneous. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\44\ The Amex, referring to several Commission releases, notesthat the development of new options products has consistently been determinedby the Commission not to provide any claim to exclusive trading rights,regardless of which SRO was responsible for initiating the design thereof,for expending funds, time and resources to promote the product, or beingthe first to file with the Commission. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Discussion </ITAG>After careful consideration of the comments received, applicable statutoryprovisions, and relevant judicial and administrative decisions, the Commissionconcludes that IPs are securities within the definition of that term inthe Act and are not contracts of sale for future delivery, and that thereforesuch products are subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission. In addition,the Commission concludes that the Phlx should not be provided either exclusivetrading privileges over IPs or the opportunity to commence IPs tradingin advance of other exchanges. For these reasons and for additional reasons set forth below, the Commissionfinds that the proposed rule changes relating to the listing and tradingof IPs are consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules andregulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, ingeneral, and the requirements or Section 6 and the rules and regulationsthereunder, in particular. A. JurisdictionIPs confer the present right to receive the current value of a portfolioof stocks, are of indefinite duration, and entitle holders to paymentsequivalent to regular cash dividends paid on the underlying stocks. Forthe reasons set forth below, the Commission concludes that IPs are securitiesas defined in the Act. Further, the Commission concludes that IPs are notfutures contracts subject to regulation under the CEA, and that regulationof IPs as securities is consistent with the purposes underlying both theAct and the CEA.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. IPs are Securities</ITAG>The Commission concludes that each of the proposed IP products is a securitywithin the definition of that term under section 3(a)(1) of the Act. Congressintended that the term ``security'' be interpreted broadly, and the SupremeCourt has, on several occasions, observed that the definition of the termsecurity ``is quite broad * * * and includes both instruments whose namesalone carry well-settled meaning, as well as instruments of `more variablecharacter' * * *.'' \4\\5\<NOTE/> It is, thus, well settled that the term ``security'' is tobe interpreted flexibly to encompass new instruments that are similar to,or have the characteristics of, instruments already recognized as securities.In particular, if ``economic reality'' suggests that such an instrumenthas the characteristics of instruments that clearly are securities, thenit should be defined as a security, even if the instrument does not fitexplicitly within the Act's enumeration of specific instruments that constitutesecurities.\4\\6\<NOTE/> Indeed, in a world of rapid development of new financialinstruments, it cannot be expected that Congress would have identifiedthe exact form of all instruments that constitute securities.\4\\7\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\5\ <T3>Landreth, </T3>471 U.S. at 686 (1985) [quoting <T3>Marine Bank, </T3>455 U.S. at 556 (1982); <T3>SEC </T3>v. <T3>C.M.

Section 3(a)(10), 15 U.S.C.78(a)(10) (1982), defines the term ``security'' as including: any note,stock, treasury stock, bond, debenture, certificate of interest or participationin any profit-sharing agreement or in any oil, gas, or other mineral royaltyor lease, any collateral-trust certificate, preorganization certificateor subscription, transferable share, investment contract, voting-trustcertificate, certificate of deposit, for a security, any put, call, straddle,option, or privilege on any security, certificate of deposit, or groupor index of securities (including any interest therein or based on thevalue thereof), or any put, call, straddle, option, or privilege enteredinto on a national securities exchange relating to foreign currency, orin general, any instrument commonly known as a ``security''; or any certificateof interest or participation in, temporary or interim certificate for,receipt for, or warrant or right to subscribe to or purchase, any of theforegoing; but shall not include currency or any note, draft, bill of exchange,or banker's acceptance which has a maturity at the time of issuance ofnot exceeding nine months, exclusive of days of grace, or any renewal thereofthe maturity of which is likewise limited.<ITAG tagnum="28">The Commission notes that the definitions of the term ``security''in section 3(a)(10) of the Act and section 2(1) of the Securities Act of1933 (``Securities Act'') are virtually identical and have been treatedas such by the Supreme Court in decisions dealing with the scope of theterm. </ITAG><T3>See, e.g., Marine Bank, </T3>455 U.S. at 555 n. 3 (1982); <T3>United Housing Foundation, Inc. </T3>v. <T3>Foreman, </T3>421 U.S. 837, 847 n. 12 (1975).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\7\ While the Commission, in its analysis of IPs has focusedprimarily on the portions of the definition discussed in the text, theremay be additional bases for concluding that IPs are securities. For example,an IP can be analogized to a receipt for the interests in the securitiesupon which it is based or to a certificate of deposit for a security. Inaddition, an analysis of IPs as investment contracts also supports theconclusion that they are securities.IPs possess the key characteristics of stock. In <T3>Landreth Timber Co. </T3>v. <T3>Landreth,</T3>\4\\8\<NOTE/> the Supreme Court's most recent decision addressing the definitionof the term ``security,'' the Court described five characteristic featuresof stock as: (1) The right to receive dividends; (2) negotiability; (3)the ability to be pledged or hypothecated; (4) the capacity to appreciatein value; and (5) the conferring of voting rights in proportion to thenumber of shares owned.\4\\9\<NOTE/> IPs have all of these characteristics, except voting rights,and have other characteristics of stock as well.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\8\ 471 U.S. 681 (1985).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\9\ <T3>Id. </T3>at 686-87.With regard to the <T3>Landreth </T3>characteristics: (1) IP purchasers will be entitled toreceive on a quarterly basis cash payments equivalent to a proportionateshare of any regular cash dividends paid on the component stocks of theunderlying portfolio; (2) because IPs will be freely transferable in exchangetransactions, such instruments will be negotiable in the same sense asexchange-traded stock; (3) IP purchasers also will have the ability topledge or hypothecate their IP interests; \50\<NOTE/> and (4) IPs will have the capacity to appreciate in valueas the underlying components appreciate in value.\51\<NOTE/> The only characteristic cited in <T3>Landreth </T3>that IPs do not provide are voting rights in the stockscomprising the Index. This difference is not, by itself, determinativeinasmuch as there are many types of securities, including some types ofstock, that do not possess voting rights. For example, preferred stockgenerally possesses either limited or no voting power.\52\<NOTE/> Accordingly, the absence of voting rights does not precludethe characterization of IPs as a security. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\50\ A customer's agreement with his brokerage firm typicallyprovides that an investor normally will pledge his interest in a security,including profits and dividends, as collateral to the broker for any indebtednessarising in connection with his account or any other indebtedness to thebroker. In contrast, futures are executory contracts which may not be pledged,except regarding rights to contingent cash payments required by the futurescontract. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\51\ In addition, insofar as the Amex EIP is concerned, thepurchaser or holder of the EIP has the right to receive physical deliveryof shares of the component stocks of the Index if he exercises the deliveryprivilege regarding a sufficient number of EIPs. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\52\ As the Court noted in <T3>Landreth, </T3>``various types of preferred stocks may have differentcharacteristics and still be covered by the Acts.'' <T3>Landreth, </T3>471 U.S. at 687, n.2 (1985). IPs have two other important characteristics normally associated with stock.First, IPs do not expire. An investor can hold them for an indeterminatetime, just as an investor may retain a portfolio of stock indefintely.Second, purchase requirements and margin treatment for IPs are analogousto stock purchase and margin requirements. As with stock, an IP purchaserpays the full purchase price for his investment at the time of purchase.The IP purchase may be financed by borrowing up to 50% of the IP purchaseprice just as a stock purchaser may borrow up to 50% of the stock purchaseprice. Thus, a margin transaction in IPs includes an actual borrowing withthe full purchase price then passed through to the IP seller. Accordingly,since IPs so closely resemble a portfolio of stock they should be includedwithin the definition of stock in section 3(a)(10). IPs also fall within the term ``certificate of interest or participationin'' stock. IPs allow investors to replicate a purchase of a portfolioof securities because the value and benefits of IP ownership track thevalue and benefits of the stocks underlying the portfolio. In addition,IPs are expressly termed ``participations.'' \53\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\53\ While the name of an instrument is not by itself dispositivein determining whether the instrument is included within the statutorydefinition of the term ``security,'' the name is one factor taken intoconsideration. <T3>Landreth, </T3>471 U.S. at 686 (1985); <T3>United Housing Foundation</T3> v. <T3>Foreman, </T3> 421 U.S. 837, 850 (1975). Although IP transactions will be reflected by book entries rather thanby the transfer of paper certificates, the absence of such certificatesdoes not remove them from the term ``certificate.'' \54\<NOTE/> The system for IP transfer is similar to the immobilizeddepository system used in connection with modern day securities transfers,which likewise do not require a formal certificate.\55\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\54\ L. Loss andamp; J. Seligman, II <T3>Securities Regulation </T3>597, 997-98 n.286 (3d ed. 1989). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\55\ The absence of a certificated instrument does not alterthe characterization of an instrument as a security. In this regard, itis noteworthy that, under relevant state commercial laws, the definitionof the term ``investment security'' does not turn on whether investorscan obtain certificated instruments to evidence their ownership interests.<T3>See, e.g., </T3>Del. Code Ann. tit. 6 andSection; 8-102(1)(c) (1988)[Uniform Commercial Code andSection; 8-102(1)(c)]. Under state commerciallaws in effect in at least 35 jurisdictions, the term ``investment securities''specifically includes ``uncertificated securities,'' transfers of whichare registered upon books maintained for that purpose by or on behalf ofthe issuer. <T3>See, e.g., </T3>Del. Code Ann. tit. 6 andSection; 8-102(1)(b) (1988);Ill. Ann. Stat. tit. 26 andSection;8-102(a)(b) (1988); Consolidated Lawsof N.Y. Ann. Book 62\1/2\ andSection; 8-102(1)(b) (1989). OCC will issueall CIPs, EIPs, and VIPs, and will maintain books for registering transfersof the same. <ITAG tagnum="28">In addition, other investments routinely are issued or held in book-entryform. Several types of securities commonly trade without any physical,negotiable certificates evidencing ownership interests. For example, U.S.Treasury Bills, Bonds, and Notes are issued exclusively in book-entry formthrough Federal Reserve Banks. Moreover, numerous states have issued debtsecurities that restrict significantly an investor's ability to obtainnegotiable certificates. </ITAG><T3>See </T3>Securities and Exchange Commission, 53rd Annual Report 35(1987); 51st Annual Report 25, 120 (1985); Securities Exchange Act ReleaseNo. 22168 (June 25, 1985), 50 FR 27078. In addition to the fact that IPs fit within several of the more specificterms enumerated in section 3(a)(10), it also is clear that the ``economicsubstance'' of an IP \56\<NOTE/> is essentially indistinguishable from the economic substanceof the more specific instruments that are defined as securities by thestatute. An investor who owns an IP will own an instrument having the sameeconomic substance as a portfolio of stocks. The financial returns on theIP will be substantially identical to the returns from holding the underlyingportfolio: capital gains or losses will be directly related to the gainsor losses from the portfolio's stocks; cash payments made quarterly tothe IP holder will consist of an amount equivalent to the regular cashdividends paid by the issuers whose securities comprise the portfolio;and margining treatment for the IP purchasers and sellers is identicalto stock margin requirements. Thus, because the ``economic substance''of the purchase of an IP is equivalent to the purchase of a portfolio ofstock, and the attributes of IPs are those commonly associated with securities,an IP constitutes ``an instrument commonly known as a security.'' <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\56\ The Court has on several occasions held that ``in searchingfor the meaning and the scope of the word `security' in the Act[s], formshould be disregarded for substance and the emphasis should be on economicreality.'' <T3>See, e.g., Tcherepnin, </T3>389 U.S. at 336 (1967). To the extent certain IP characteristics differ somewhat from the characteristicsof stock, they resemble characteristics commonly found in rights to purchaseor puts or calls on a security or index of securities_interests specificallydenominated as securities by the Act.\57\<NOTE/> In this regard, the cash-out and physical delivery featuresof IPs are the equivalent of a put or call right that accompanies the portfolioof stock represented by the IP, much like ``buy-sell'' agreements for stocks.\58\<NOTE/> In particular, the periodic cash-out feature merely createsa right similar to that commonly found in stock transactions where, atspecified times, one party to a transaction has a right to purchase orsell a security according to a formula price that might be determined onthe basis of book value, and appraisal, or a formula related to marketvalue (whereas the IP right is related to the price of a specified indexof securities).\59\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\57\ The futures commentators suggest that IPs are dissimilarto index options because there is no apparent premium paid by an IP long.In this regard, while IPs contain some characteristics of stock index options(<T3>e.g., </T3>the issuance and clearance and settlement features of IPsare analogous to those of stock index options), the Commission believesthat IPs predominantly have the attributes of a portfolio of common stock.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\58\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>D. Gladstone, <T3>Venture Capital Handbook </T3>129-30, 237 (1983); <T3>Arley Merchandise Corp.,</T3> [1984-1988 Transfer Binder] Fed. Sec.L. Rep. (CCH) andpara; 77,878.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\59\ Moreover, the addition of a periodic ``buy-sell'' or``put-call'' right does not transform a security subject to such a rightinto a future; nor does it transform a portfolio of stock subject to sucha right into a future; and it does not transform an IP into a future.These additional attributes, like the other features of IPs, cause theIP to fall within the instruments included within the definition of theterm ``security'' in section 3(a)(10) of the Act.\60\<NOTE/> Accordingly, for all of the above reasons, an IP is a securityas defined in the Act. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\60\ <T3>See </T3>15 U.S.C. 77b(1) and 78c(a)(10 (1982).<ITAG tagnum="81">2. IPs are not Futures </ITAG>Futures commentators argue that the Commission lacks jurisdiction to authorizethe trading of IPs on securities exchanges because IPs constitute stockindex futures subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the CFTC.\61\<NOTE/> The Commission disagrees with the futures commentators'ssuggestion that IPs constitute futures contracts. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\61\ <T3>See </T3>Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the CEA.The term ``futures contract'' is not defined in the CEA of the CFTC's regulations.While characterization of the term ``future'' requires an examination ofall the surrounding circumstances, futures contracts generally are: (1)Standardized contracts imposing a bilateral obligation for the purchaseor sale of commodities at a specific price that provide for future, asopposed to immediate, delivery on a specific date; (2) directly or indirectlyoffered to the general public; (3) secured by earnest money or ``margin;''(4) entered into primarily for the purpose of assuming or shifting riskas opposed to transferring ownership of commodities; and (5) generallyextinguished by executing off-setting contracts prior to the date on whichdelivery is called for by acceptance of a cash payment representing thedifference in price between the initial and off-setting transactions.\62\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\62\ Gilberg, Regulation of New Financial Instruments Underthe Federal Securities and Commodities Laws, 39 <T3>Vand.

The purchaser has the right to sell out thecontract at any time, the right to hypothecate the contract, and the rightto ``cash out'' the contract at pre-set periodic dates.\6\\7\<NOTE/> The obligation of an IP contract to make regular cash dividendequivalent payments falls unilaterally on the seller. The other obligationof an IP contract_to pay the present market price of the IP when the otherside cashes out_is also unilateral.\6\\8\<NOTE/> More importantly, the IP cash-out obligation is fundamentallydifferent from the obligation inherent in a futures contract because theIP obligation is contingent upon exercise of the cash-out privilege. Indeed,unless the privilege is exercised, the obligation is perpetual until theholder of the obligation extinguishes its IP position. No futures contracthas this characteristic.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\\6\If the IP purchaser has bought on margin, the purchasermay have a continuing margin obligation, but that obligation is to thelender, not to the IP seller. <T3>See </T3>note 40, <T3>supra.</T3><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\\7\The Commission believes that the cash settlement featureof an IP does not support the futures commentators' argument that in substancean IP is a stock index future. In the 1982 amendments to the definitionof the term ``security'' contained in both the Securities Act and the Act,Congress explicitly recognized that products designed to have the economicsubstance of securities are themselves securities, even though settledin cash on the basis of the value of an underlying index.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\\8\The unilateral obligation falls only on the seller ofa CIP or EIP, and on both parties with a VIP. The VIP obligations for theseller and purchaser are not bilateral in that each is discretionary becauseit is dependent on the exercise of the right imposing that obligation.As noted previously, in addition to the primary elements of futurity andbilateral obligation, several other characteristics have been used to determinethe existence of futures contracts.\6\\9\<NOTE/> In particular, the characteristics of standardization andoffset provide little meaningful assistance in determining whether an instrumentis a futures contract rather than a security. Other markets, such as stockoptions markets, regularly offer standardized contracts to the generalpublic without having those contracts considered ``futures contracts.''\7\\0\<NOTE/> The fact that IPs are standardized and offered to the publicneither adds to nor detracts from the Commission's conclusion that IPsare not futures. Similarly, the offset characteristics of IPs and stockoptions are identical. Specifically, as in the case of options, the saleof an IP with the same terms as the one purchased, or the purchase of anIP with the same terms as the one sold, will extinguish the previouslyestablished IP position. The availability of a secondary market to offsetan IP position thus fails to distinguish IPs from other securities thatare not futures and provides no support for the categorization of IPs asfutures.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\\9\<T3>Supra </T3>note 62 and accompanying text.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\\0\As another example, insurance contracts also are standardized,offered to the public, and can rely on the occurrence of future events,but are not considered ``futures contracts.''The requirement that futures contracts generally be secured by earnestmoney margin further differentiates IPs from futures contracts. Marginingpractices for IPs and futures are dramatically different. As noted above,as with stock, an IP purchaser pays the full purchase price for the IPinvestment at the time of purchase. Margin treatment for IPs will be analogousto stock margin requirements. The investor is required to pay the fullpurchase price of the IP at the time of purchase, but may borrow up to50% to pay for the purchase. Thus, IP margins regulate credit. This isentirely unlike a futures transaction in which margin acts as a ``goodfaith'' deposit to ensure that the parties will meet their contractualobligations in the future.\7\\1\<NOTE/> Accordingly, the ``margin'' element of the definition offutures suggests that IPs are securities, not futures contracts.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\\1\<T3>See generally </T3>Figlewski, Margins and Market Integrity: MarginSetting for Stock Index Futures and Options, 4 <T3>J. Futures Markets </T3>385 (1984). As recently explained in a Congressionalreport: Futures margins do not regulate credit, since no credit is grantedon futures contracts. Futures margins constitute a (partial) guaranteethat both parties will honor their financial obligations and thus functionas a kind of performance bond. Moreover, futures margins, unlike securitiesmargins, must be posted daily (sometimes intra-daily) to cover all dailylosses on futures contracts. Report on the Regulation of Futures Margins,Comm. Print 100-6 (Aug. 1988) at 1, 8.<ITAG tagnum="28">The futures commentators have argued that securities-style marginingis fundamentally different from futures-style margining, and, for the reasonsset forth by those commentators, the Commission agrees that IPs marginsdo not have the ``earnest money'' characteristic of futures contracts.</ITAG><T3>See, e.g., </T3>Testimony of William F. Brodsky, President, CME Beforethe House Subcommittee on Domestic Monetary Policy of the Committee onBanking, Finance and Urban Affairs (May 25, 1988) at 2-4; Statement ofKarsten Mahlmann, Chairman, CBT before the House Domestic Monetary PolicySubcommittee of the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs (May25, 1988) at 34; Notice of Petition for Rulemaking (Domestic Exchange-TradedCommodity Options; Margins)S, 54 FR 11233 (March 17, 1989).The CME agrues that, while an IP long position is entitled to be held indefinitely,the quarterly cash-out feature creates a quarterly expiration identicalto the cycle now applicable for similar futures contracts. The CME assertsthat this feature is synonymous with an ``undated futures market contract.''\7\\2\<NOTE/> The CME asserts further that the outcome of effective competitionwill be that at the time of purchase an IP long actually will pay a higherIP price reflecting payment of a commission to ``roll over'' the position,at the quarterly expiration date. The analogy to undated futures marketsfails, however, for independent economic and legal reasons, and the contentionthat IP pricing will reflect payment of a ``commission'' to ``roll over''this position is both speculative and irrelevant.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\\2\ <T3>See, e.g.,</T3> 1st CME Letter at 2 [citing Gehr, Undated Futures Markets,8 <T3>J. Futures Markets,</T3> 89 (1988)]. First, undated ``futures'' markets\7\\3\<NOTE/> require the joint determination of two prices: a spot commoditiesprice and an associated intra-day interest charge\7\\4\<NOTE/> that is normally equal to the interest that could be earnedby investing an amount equal to the value of the commodity plus the costof one day's storage, <T3>i.e.,</T3> one day's carrying cost.\7\\5\<NOTE/> An investor cannot participate in the undated futures marketwithout also paying or receiving the associated interest charge. Becauseof the need to incur this associated interest charge, the ``futures contract''never gives rise to a present interest in the current value of a commodity.In contrast, IP contracts have no associated interest charge and constitutea <T3>present</T3> interest in a <T3>current</T3> value of an underlying portfolio. Thus, the presence ofthe associated interest charge creates in an ``undated'' futures marketan element of futurity wholly absent from IPs.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\\3\ Gehr describes the market studied in his article asa ``curiosum.'' Gehr, <T3>supra</T3> note 72, at 89. No such curiosa exist in U.S. financialmarkets. Moreover, the fact that these markets might be called ``futures''in Hong Kong or elsewhere does not mean that they would be defined as futuresunder the CEA. Finally, even if such markets were defined as futures marketsunder the CEA, the presence of a daily interest charge still would distinguishthem from IPs.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\\4\ The daily ``interest'' payments, made for the privilegeof deferring, making or taking delivery of the commodity, may be ``positive,''paid by sellers to buyers, or ``negative,'' paid by buyers to sellers.Gehr, <T3>id.</T3>, at 90-91.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\\5\<T3>See </T3>Gehr, <T3>id</T3>., at 91.Second, in regard to the suggestion that an IP long will pay a commission,in the form of higher prices, to ``roll over'' the position, the Commissionbelieves that IP prices will be based largely on the value of the underlyingportfolio and anticipated dividends on the components of the underlyingindex. The Commission does not believe that a ``roll over'' expense necessarilywill be incorporated into an IP premium. Moreover, even if such a de factorcharge were to develop, the Commission does not believe that such a chargewould transmute the IP into a ``contract for future delivery'' of the underlyingindex because of the IPs' other distinguishing characteristics. The CME also suggests that the IP dividend payment is analogous to a cashpayment from the short of the long, related to measured or theoreticalshrinkages in the value of the underlying product, as occurs in the frozenskinned ham futures market.\7\\6\<NOTE/> The Commission observes, however, that dividends are discretionarycorporate payments, the size of which is determined on a voluntary basisby the corporation's board of directors. Corporations can raise or lowerdividends, and the right to receive dividends is a significant attributeof stock. Thus, the payment of a cash dividend equivalent to IP holdersensures that the IP contains the investment features of stock. In contrast,the shrinkage factor in a frozen skinned ham futures contract is determinedaccording to a pre-set formula calculated in order to assure that purchasersof frozen skinned hams do not pay for a weight that will not exist at thatpoint in the future when the contract expires and the ham has shrunk. Theshrinkage factor is thus inexorably linked to the futurity of the ham contract(<T3>i.e.,</T3> but for futurity, no price adjustment for shrinkage wouldbe necessary). The IP contract has no futurity, is not subject to shrinkage,and receives and pays dividends based on discretionary corporate decisions.The Commission thus rejects the argument that IPs should be consideredfutures because the shrinkage of frozen skinned hams in similar to thepayment of corporate dividends. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\\6\ <T3>See</T3> 1st CME Letter are 2-3. Finally, the CME suggests that the Phlx daily CIP cash-out does not alterits characterization as a futures contract. In this regard the CME claimsthat:<ITAG tagnum="20">the differences between the Sandamp;P Futures and CIP are insignificant,relating solely to a probable slight difference in pricing related to thetheoretical daily convergence of the cash and futures contract in the caseof the PHLX CIP and the quarterly convergence in the case of the CME'sSandamp;P 500 futures. That difference is defined by well established arbitragerelationships reflecting the differences in maturity dates.\7\\7\</ITAG><NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\\7\ <T3>See</T3> 5th CME Letter at 1.It is not at all clear that the pricing differences between the Sandamp;P500 future and the CIP will be ``insignificant.'' Pricing of IPs and indexfutures should diverge because of the substantial differences in marginingpractices, divergences between an IP's perpetual nature and the quarterlyexpiration feature of a stock index future, and the payment of regularcash dividend equivalents on IPs. In addition, IPs will trade on marketswith different marketmaking characteristics and may be brought or soldby retail investors who may not participate in the future markets.\7\\8\<NOTE/> Many IP investors also may be effectively prohibited fromparticipating in futures markets as a result of regulatory constraintsor contractual prohibitions. Therefore, because of differences in the structureof the instruments, trading practices, and investor populations, it isunsubstantiated speculation to contend that the difference in pricing betweenIPs and index futures will be ``insignificant.''<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\\8\ <T3>See</T3> note 96, <T3>infra</T3> and accompanying text. In addition, the pricing differences between the Sandamp;P 500 future andall IPs (including those with quarterly cash-outs) will not replicate theformula commonly used to determine the theoretical value of a stock futurescontract. Such a formula would add the interest on the price of the portfolioto the index price, subtract the annualized dividend yield, and factorin the days remaining until expiration.\7\\9\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\\9\ <T3>See generally</T3> B. Byrne Jr., <T3>The Stock Index Futures Market</T3> 170 (1987). The pricing formulacontains the following elements: Futures price = (Stock Portfolio Price)+ [(Risk Free Interest Rate ^ Annualized Dividend Yield on Stock Index)x Days Until Expiration/365].<ITAG tagnum="28">Unlike futures, the interest on the difference between full paymentfor a portfolio of stocks and the earnest money margin payment for a futurewould not be relevant to IP pricing because IPs are fully paid for at thetime of the purchase. In addition, the value of expected dividends on theportfolio would not be subtracted because the IP purchaser would have theright to receive the equivalent of those regular cash dividends.</ITAG>The futures commentators suggest that by manipulating the terms of thisand similar equations they are able to demonstrate algebraic relationshipsbetween the pricing of IPs and the pricing of futures contracts, and thusthat IPs should be regulated as futures because they are priced ``like''futures. These equations, however, also can be used to demonstrate, bya different manipulation of the equation's terms, that existing futurescontracts are equivalent to a straightforward stock portfolio position.It simply does not follow that futures should be regulated as stocks becausethey are priced ``like'' stocks, or vice versa. Similarly, IPs should notbe regulated as futures merely because an algebraic manipulation of a pricingformula might demonstrate that they are priced like futures. Thus, theCME emphasis on pricing similarities is not determinative.Other somewhat more complex arbitrage and equivalence relationships alsodo not serve to demonstrate that IPs are futures. For example, it is possibleto create a synthetic future on a stock index by purchasing European stylecalls and writing European style puts that have appropriate exercise pricesand times to maturity.\80\<NOTE/> ``Hence when options on an asset or commodity are traded,but there is no futures market, it is always possible to construct a syntheticfutures contract.'' \81\<NOTE/> It does not follow, however, that, because futures positionscan be replicated by options positions, futures are really options. Likewise,it does not follow that, because options positions can be replicated byfutures, options are really futures. Similarly, futures can be used toreplicate a variety of other securities. For example, futures can be usedto create a portfolio that has the cash flow characteristics of a broadbased equity portfolio. Again, it does not follow that an equity portfolioshould be regulated as a future or that an index future should be regulatedas a security because it is possible to define an arbitrage or equivalencerelationship between them. Thus, while the modern theory of finance andits virtually limitless repertoire of equivalence relations may be veryvaluable for arbitrage, pricing and other analytic purposes, it is of littlevalue when it comes to addressing the technical, legal issues of jurisdictionposed by the introduction of IPs and other financial products. Indeed,the limitless use of such models would be plainly inconsistent with thestructure of the CEA and the securities laws, which are designed to separateregulation of futures and securitries.\82\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\80\ T.

Specifically, Congress includeda proviso that, with the exception of the grant of exclusive jurisdictionregarding contracts for future delivery, ``nothing contained in this sectionshall (i) supersede or limit the jurisdiction at any time conferred onthe Securities and Exchange Commission * * * or (ii) restrict the Securitiesand Exchange Commission * * * from carrying out [its] duties and responsibilities* * *.''

Futures regulation at the federal level is a direct outgrowthof serious problems in the marketplace that Congress perceived as detrimentalto interstate commerce and the national public interest.\83\<NOTE/> In 1936, when the CEA was enacted (extensively amending theGrain Futures Act of 1922), Congress recognized that pervasive manipulation,excessive speculation, trading abuses (<T3>e.g.,</T3> wash sales, fictitious trades, and accommodation trades),and the rampant growth of boiler-rooms threatened to destroy the utilityof the futures markets. In 1974, Congress determined that additional toolswere necessary to ensure adequate regulation of all futures trading andfutures professionals and to allow for the extension of the economic benefitsof futures trading to those areas of commerce where the functions of futuresmarkets might be useful.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\83\ 7 U.S.C. 5 (1982).Approval of IPs for trading on securities exchanges, in a fully regulatedenvironment, would not give rise to the abuses that Congress sought toprevent by adopting the CEA. As exchange-listed securities, IPs will besubject to a comprehensive regulatory structure under the federal securitieslaws and to Commission oversight similar to the regulatory regime applicableto futures under the CEA.\84\<NOTE/> Indeed, the CFTC's regulatory authority over contract marketswas modeled in part on the Commission's authority over securites exchanges.\85\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\84\ Bromberg, <T3>Commodities Law and Securities_Overlaps and Preemptions, </T3>1 J.Corp.

IPs Are Not subject to the Investment Company Act</ITAG>The Commission believes that an IP does not involve the creation of aninvestment company, because there is no ``issuer,'' within the meaningof Section 3(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, 15 U.S.C. 80a-3,that is either ``engaged * * * primarily in the business of investing,reinvesting, or trading in securities'' or ``engaged * * * in the businessof investing, reinvesting, owning, holding, or trading in securities, andowns * * * investment securities having a value exceeding 40 per centumof the value of such issuer's total assets * * *.'' Moreover, OCC, theissuer of IPs, is a clearing agency registered as such under the Act. AClearing agency cannot be registered as such under the Act until the Commissionmakes certain findings required by section 17A(b)(3), including that theclearing agency has the capacity to facilitate the prompt and accurateclearance and settlement of securities transactions and to safeguard securitiesand funds in its custody. These qualifications support the conclusion thatthe OCC would be an issuer primarily engaged ``in a business or businessesother than that of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding, or tradingin securities.''\86\<NOTE/> Moreover, given the existing securities law regulation ofthe OCC under Section 17A of the Act and the exchanges under Section 6of the Act, the Commission sees no purpose that would be served by subjectingthis arrangement to investment company regulation.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\86\ <T3>See</T3> Section 3(b)(1) of the Investment Company Act of 1940. 15U.S.C. 80a-3(b)(1) (1982).Nor does there exist an investment company within the OCC (or OCC combinedwith the exchanges), the IP purchasers viewed collectively, or the IP shortsviewed collectively.

This couldadd an additional layer of liquidity to the market to help absorb the velocityand concentration of trading associated with index-related trading strategies.\95\<NOTE/> Moreover, because market baskets would be traded at a singlelocation on the exchange floor, at which program trading order flow couldbe concentrated and imbalances in such trading determined, they would notresult in the same market information limitations that result from executingprogram trades in the individual stocks.

Grundfest, ``WouldMore Regulation Prevent Another Black Monday?,'' Address before the CATOInstitute Policy Forum on July 20, 1988, at 13-14 (available at the Commission);H. Stoll and R. Whaley, Program Trading and the Monday Massacre (November4, 1987) (available at the Owen Graduate School of Management, VanderbiltUniversity); and H. Stoll, <T3>Portfolio Trading,</T3> Working Paper No. 87-14 (Sept. 1987) (availableat the Owen Graduate School of Management, Vanderbilt University).For the reasons discussed below, the Commission believes that IPs willprovide retail investors with a cost efficient means to make investmentdecisions based on the direction of the market as a whole \9\\6\<NOTE/> and may provide stock market participants several advantagesover existing methods of effecting program trades of stocks.\9\\7\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\\6\ Because of the small retail size of index participationsand the attendant costs of executing sufficient IP transactions in an attemptto replicate large portfolios, the Commission believes that such instrumentsare designed to handle retail investor interest to invest in the ``market''.The Phlx, Amex, and CBOE believe that IPs could be used by retail investorsto make investment decisions based on the direction of the market as awhole, thereby providing them with a cost efficient means by which to takeadvantage of anticipated market swings. In addition, an IP investment couldprovide an individual investor with an additional source of securitiesincome. The product could also be useful to institutional investors fortheir investment strategies.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\\7\ In this regard, the Commission believes that the listingand trading of IPs on national securities exchanges may reduce market volatilityassociated with program trades of stock because, excluding the Amex EIP,IPs generally will be cash-settled, and existing exchanges' stock indexoptions surveillance procedures will be applicable to IPs. The Amex notesthat the share delivery alternative provides a feature discussed in theStaff Report and will enhance the utility of EIPs for institutions. StaffReport at 3-19 to 3-20.Because IPs would be traded as market baskets at a single specialist poston the exchanges' floors, program trading order flow involving IPs canbe concentrated at that post and imbalances in such trading determined.Thus, IPs trading would not result in the same market information limitationsthat result from executing program trades in individual stocks. Moreover,the availability of IPs may provide a more efficient alternative to directprogram trades of individual stocks for some institutional investors. Finally,as a separate product, IPs would be easy and inexpensive to trade, clear,and settle.C. EIP Physical Delivery ProposalThe Commission also believes that the Amex proposal to permit physicaldelivery of its EIPs is consistent with the Act. Indeed, the availabilityof physical delivery permits institutions to employ EIPs to adjust theirstock portfolios. As a result, EIPs may have greater potential for providingthe liquidity benefits envisioned for market baskets in the Staff Report.Although providing certain benefits, the Amex's proposed EIP physical deliverydoes raise some concerns. The Amex's proposed rule change provides fora physical delivery facilitator (``PDF'') to make physical delivery ofthe component stocks of the underlying portfolio to EIP holders who exercisethe delivery privilege, if and only if, the number of delivery units forwhich holders have requested physical delivery exceeds the number of deliveryunits offered for physical delivery by persons holding short positions.The Amex proposes to inform the PDF, several hours before the opening oftrading, of the imbalance between delivery units offered and delivery unitsdemanded in order that the PDF may make arrangements that would enableit to obtain as agent at the opening the additional shares of the stocksthat constitute the underlying portfolio to satisfy its obligations.The Commission believes that PDF pre-opening knowledge of the imblancebetween delivery units offered and delivery units demanded can providethe PDF with an informational advantage concerning pre-opening order flow.Because this imbalance would always be on the buy side, and because itsexistence and magnitude would be known only to the PDF, the AMEX proposalraises the possibility that the PDF might take advantage of the informationby establishing or liquidating stock, options, and/or futures positions.In this regard, however, the Amex will place restrictions on the PDF'sfunction. In particular, the PDF must announce to the trading crowd, andthe Exchange shall cause to be publicly reported, the physical deliveryunit imbalance at or prior to 9:00 a.m. on Exercise Friday. Thus, the PDF'sopportunity to trade on ``inside'' market information should be substantiallyreduced. Moreover, because the PDF must satisfy the physical delivery unitimbalance only by purchasing such imbalance at the opening rather thanutilizing its existing inventory, the PDF's role is limited to that ofan agent. Accordingly, the Commission believes the Amex has sufficientlyaddressed any concerns about the physical delivery mechanism.D. Phlx Blue Chip IndexCertain of the proposed underlying portfolios, such as the Amex MMI andthe Sandamp;P 500, have been published for several years and have been usedas a basis for stock index options trading. In approving these portfoliosas bases for options trading (and commenting on them for future trading),the Commission has determined that the use of these underlying portfoliosdoes not raise manipulation concerns.\9\\8\<NOTE/> The Commission believes that the introduction of IPs basedon these portfolios should not raise additional manipulation concerns.\9\\9\<NOTE/> The Phlx, however, has developed, specifically for IPs trading,a new Blue Chip CIP.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\\8\ <T3>See</T3> section 6(b)(5) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5) (1982), whichrequires that the rules of a national securities exchange be designed toprevent fraudulent and manipulative practices.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\\9\ The Commission believes that IPs will not raise thesame problems as other portfolio-related products regarding to intermarkettrading strategies that at times may have increased the concentration andvelocity of market movements. While the Commission notes that IPs willcreate arbitrage opportunities with either the cash market or other derivativeproducts, and may spawn new intermarket trading strategies, because ofthe proposed 50% margin requirement for IPs (analogous to stock marginrequirements) the leverage concerns that exist with other equity derivativeproducts are absent. <T3>See</T3> Report of the Presidential Task Force on Market Mechanisms(January 1988), at III-7; Division of Market Regulation, <T3>The October 1987 Market Break,</T3> (February 2, 1988) at 11-1. Moreover,by providing market participants with a means to trade ``the market'' withoutbuying and selling dozens or hundreds of individual stocks, IPs could lessenthe impact of portfolio trading strategies.For several reasons, the Commission does not believe that the Blue ChipCIP raises significant manipulation concerns. Although the Blue Chip CIPis comprised of only 25 securities, it represents approximately 13 industrygroups and is designed specifically to replicate the performance of theDJIA. The broad diversification, large capitalization, and deep and liquidmarkets of the portfolio's component stocks significantly minimize thepotential for manipulation.\1\\0\\0\<NOTE/> The ten most highly price-weighted stocks in the Blue ChipCIP account for less than 58% of the portfolio's cumulative market value.\1\\0\\1\<NOTE/> Although IBM accounts for 8.73% of the Blue Chip CIP's price-weighting,the Commission believes manipulation of the CIP through trading in IBMis made more difficult because the stock is widely held and actively traded.\1\\0\\2\<NOTE/> In addition, the proposed trading of IPs by the exchanges,which already have well-established stock and options surveillance procedures,does not appear to give rise to major surveillance concerns because existingsurveillance procedures will be applicable to IPs trading. In addition,the Phlx has the necessary surveillance sharing arrangement with the exchangeswhose securities comprise the Blue Chip CIP. Specifically, the Phlx andthe NYSE are members of the Intermarket Surveillance Group (``ISG'').\1\\0\\3\<NOTE/> As members, these markets are required to share surveillanceinformation with one another.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\\0\ The Blue Chip CIP is price-weighted. Accordingly,an issue's weight in the total portfolio value is based on its price pershare rather than its total market capitalization (<T3>i.e.,</T3> price per share times the number of shares outstanding).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\\1\ By comparison the 10 most highly price-weightedstocks in the MMI account for approximately 70% of that portfolio's cumulativemarket value.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\\2\ For the period February 1988 through January 1989,IBM's Average Daily Volume (``ADV'') was approximately 1,357,900 shares.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\\3\ The on-going task of the ISG is to create and maintaina coordinated intermarket surveillance system to ensure that intermarketsurveillance concerns are appropriately addressed.E. Proprietary ConcernsIn general, the Phlx argues that simultaneous Commission approval of theAmex's proposed rule change to trade IPs would neither be in the publicinterest nor promote fair competition among exchange markets. In supportof this view the Phlx suggests that Commission approval of Amex's ``copycat'' filing would deprive the Phlx (which claims to be the IP developer)of the opportunity to take advantage of the primary market phenomenon.In addition, the Phlx suggests that such Commission approval would stifleproduct innovation, design, and creativity. The Commission is of the viewthat approval of the Amex and Phlx proposals simultaneously is consistentwith the Act.To the extent that Phlx's ``copy cat'' argument implicates a claim of misappropriationor infringement of a protected property right, the Commission believesit is inappropriate for it to attempt to resolve these issues in a proceedinginvolving the approval of securities to be traded in a particular marketplace. Congress has enacted an elaborate statutory framework for the establishment,preservation, and protection of intellectual property rights and establishedspecific federal agencies (<T3>e.g.,</T3> the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and the U.S. CopyrightOffice), to administer these laws. Separate state causes of action alsomay be available to Phlx. Neither the plain language of these statutesnor any provision of the Act suggests that Congress intended that the Commissionattempt, in the context of an approval proceeding, to resolve intellectualproperty right claims that can be pursued elsewhere.Moreover, while the Commission recognizes that, under the appropriate circumstances,incentives for innovation can promote long term competition and providesubstantial benefits to the marketplace, on the basis of the record inthis proceeding the Commission believes that simultaneous approval of thePhlx, Amex, and CBOE proposals is consistent with the Act. The Commissionhas been presented with numerous proposals to list and trade new securitiesproducts in recent years. In particular, the Commission, on November 22,1982, approved a number of exchange proposals to trade narrow and/or broadbased index options, often on similar or identical indexes, although suchindexes were submitted to the Commission on different dates.\1\\0\\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\\4\ <T3>See</T3> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 19264 (November 22, 1982),47 FR 53981.The Commission recognizes Phlx's argument that IPs are a novel productinvolving substantially more innovation then past new options products.Nevertheless, the Commission believes that the opportunity for competitionamong markets trading IPs simultaneously furthers the purposes of the federalsecurities laws.\1\\0\\5\<NOTE/> Past experience has indicated that an exchange which initiallycommences trading an options contract has an extremely large advantageover any subsequent competitor. Accordingly, the Commission is concernedthat a temporary grant of exclusivity to the Phlx could have the effectof substantially reducing potential future competition in IPs, which effectoutweighs the benefits of incentives to innovation that might, in thiscase, result from a temporary grant of exclusivity. Thus, the Commissionhas concluded that simultaneous approval of the proposals is consistentwith the Act.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\\5\ <T3>See</T3> Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 18297 (December 2, 1981),46 FR 60376 (``Unrestricted inter-exchange competition in the non-equityoptions markets most likely would result in the development of optionscontracts best suited to the economic needs of market participants ratherthan discourage innovation, research, and development of new products''),22026 (May 8, 1985) 50 FR 20310 (``The goals of the Act are inconsistentwith affirmatively delaying the start-up of trading in options on over-the-counterstocks in a manner that benefits one particular market place because thereis no regulatory purpose which would require such a delay'').F. Regulationof Member Organizations Doing Business with Public Customers<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Disclosure</ITAG>In order to promote investor protection and to ensure adequate disclosurein connection with IPs, the Phlx, Amex, and CBOE propose that their rulespertaining to standardized options and the requirements of Commission Rule9b-1 also apply to IPs trading.\106\<NOTE/> In this regard, the OCC requests that the Commission issuean order pursuant to Rule 9b-1(a)(4) of the Act, treating IPs for disclosurepurposes as another type of security that should be treated in a mannersimilar to ``standardized options'' under Rule  9b-1.\107\<NOTE/> OCC suggests that each of the reasons cited by the Reportof the Special Study of the Options Market (``Options Study'')\108\<NOTE/> for establishing a separate disclosure system for standardizedoptions applies equally to IPs.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\106\ The applicability of Rule 9b-1 relieves an issuer fromthe requirement of delivering a prospectus to each IP customer. Nevertheless,an issuer must deliver its prospectus to each market upon which the IPsare traded, for the purpose of redelivery to IPs customers upon their request.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\107\ <T3>See </T3>Letter from William H. Navin, Schiff Hardin andamp; Waite, OCClegal counsel, to Richard G. Ketchum, Director, Division of Market Regulation,and Linda C. Quinn, Director, Division of Corporation Finance, SEC, datedJuly 6, 1988 (``Schiff Letter''). The Schiff letter requests also thatIPs be treated in a manner similar to standardized options for purposesof Rules 134a and 153b and Form S-20 under the Securities Act of 1933 (``SecuritiesAct''). In addition, the Schiff letter requests that the Commission staffconfirm that IPs will be treated in a manner similar to standardized optionsfor the purpose of calculating Securities Act registration fees and thatForm 8-A will be available for IP registration under the Act notwithstandingthat OCC is exempt from the periodic reporting requirements of the Act.<T3>See </T3>Schiff letter at 5 and 6 for a more detailed explanation.Moreover, although the exchanges have not requested exemption of IP underlyingsecurities from the applicability of Rule 12a-6 of the Act, the Commissionnotes that pursuant to that Rule IP underlying securities are exempt fromthe operation of section 12(a) of the Act.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\108\ <T3>Report of the Special Study of the Options Markets to the Securitiesand Exchange Commission, </T3>96th Cong., 1st Sess. (Comm. Print 1978)(``Options Study'').As with other securities issued by OCC, the clearing corporation interposesitself between IP buyers and sellers, and is technically the ``issuer''of each contract. Moreover, just as with other OCC issued securities, theCommission believes providing investors with detailed descriptive informationregarding the issuer would not be useful. Instead, a disclosure documentthat provides a discussion of the terms and risks of IPs would appear tobe substantially more useful to investors.The Commission believes that the reasons cited by the 1978 Options Studyfor establishing a separate disclosure system for other OCC issued securitiesare equally applicable to IPs. First, regular disclosure under the SecuritiesAct of 1933 (``Securities Act'') focuses on disclosures regarding the issuerof the security. As with other OCC issued securities providing this typeof disclosure to investors is not useful for IPs. While OCC's solvencyis obviously relevant, an investor primarily is purchasing the equivalentof a portfolio of stock. Accordingly, a disclosure document that providesa discussion of the terms and risks of IPs would appear substantially moreuseful to investors. Second, delivery of a Securities Act prospectus toall IP investors and redelivery of any updated prospectus would be an inefficientand unnecessarily costly way of educating the public regarding IPs. Inthis regard, OCC has prepared a special IPs disclosure document (``IDD'')explaining in detail the economic and risk characteristics of IPs, themechanism of buying, selling and exercising IPs, and the market in whichIPs will trade.\109\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\109\ In reviewing any disclosure materials submitted, theCommission intends to assure that the materials specifically describe IPs,explain their uses, detail the special risks associated with IPs trading,and emphasize that IP contracts, unlike options, obligate a writer to payto the holder an amount equivalent to a proportionate share of dividendsdeclared on the underlying index components.In addition, the Amex, Phlx, and CBOE propose to require that every exchangemember and member organization deliver to each customer a current IDD ator prior to the time such customer's account is approved for IPs trading.\110\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\110\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>Amex Rule 926(a). The Commission believes that priordistribution of the IDD to investors is necessary before that person mayeffect a transaction in IPs. This prior distribution could be accomplishedby physically delivering an IDD to an investor before he effects an IPtransaction or by a mass mailing of the IDD to customers who have beenapproved for options trading, followed by a period of time in which investorscould comprehend the IDD and other relevant information pertaining to theeconomic and risk characteristics of IPs trading.As a result, the Commission believes that IPs are a type of security thatfalls into the category of ``other security'' under Rule 9b-1 which theCommission should treat in a manner similar to standardized options forpurposes of Rule 9b-1 under the Act.\111\<NOTE/> Indeed, in amending the definition of the term standardizedoption to include ``such other securities as the Commission may, by order,designate'' the Commission noted that it added the new language ``to authorizethe Commission, by order, to allow the use of Rule 9b-1 for new investmentvehicles that the Commission believes should be included within the newdisclosure framework.''\112\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\111\ 17 CFR 240.9b-1(a)(4) (1988).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\112\ <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 19055 (September 16, 1982),47 FR 41950, 41954.For the reasons discussed above, the Commission also believes that IPsshould be treated in a manner similar to standardized options for purposesof Rules 134a and 153b and Form S-20 under the Securities Act. The Commissionfurther believes that IPs should be treated similarly to standardized optionsfor purposes of calculating Securities Act registration fees and that Form8-A will be available for IP registration under the Act.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Marketing of IPs</ITAG>The exchanges propose further that their existing options suitability rules\113\<NOTE/> be applied to IP transactions. In general, under these procedures,before approving a customer's account for stock options trading, a firmmust seek to obtain background and financial information including, amongother things, the customer's investment experience, employment status,net worth, annual income, age, and investment objectives.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\113\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>Phlx Rule 1026; CBOE Rule 9.7.The Commission believes it appropriate that the exchanges apply the heightenedsuitability requirements of their options suitability rules to IPs transactions.Thus, no exchange member or member organization shall recommend to anycustomer any IP transaction unless such member or member organization hasreasonable grounds to believe that the recommended transaction is not unsuitablefor such customer. The exchanges also propose that registered representatives who are qualifiedto sell stock index options should not be required to take a separate examinationin order to transact business concerning index participations.\114\<NOTE/> In addition, the exchanges do not propose that RegisteredOptions Principals be required to take a separate IPs examination to qualifyto act in a supervisory capacity with respect to the sale of IPs to publiccustomers. the Commission concurs with the exchange's proposals.\115\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\114\<T3>See, </T3><T3>e.q., </T3>Phlx Rules 1024 and 1025; Amex Rules 920 and 922. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\115\Nevertheless, once IPs are approved for trading, we wouldanticipate that the question files for both the General Securities Representativeand Registered Option Principal Examinations would be updated to includequestions concerning index participations. In addition, the exchanges propose that IPs be subject to position andexercise limits of 15 million IPs with respect to any particular underlyingportfolio, and that each member and member organization shall file withthe exchanges a report with respect to each account in which such memberor member organization has an interest, each account of a partner, officer,director or employee of the member organization, and each customer account,which has established an aggregate position of 200,000 IPs (whether longor short) covering the same underlying portfolio. These rules are designed,in part, to limit the ability of IP traders to manipulate or disrupt themarket for IPs or the underlying securities and provide the exchanges andthe Commission with empirical data concerning the development of the IPmarket. In addition, such limits should help protect OCC from unacceptablerisk. An IP position at the maximum level would have a current market valueof approximately $390 million, less than for stock index options ($625million). The Commission believes that fixed maximum position and exerciselimits of 15 million IPs and the proposed 200,000 aggregate position reportingrequirement of IPs are sufficient to achieve their intended purposes. The exchanges propose to halt or suspend trading in IPs whenever the exchangesdeem such action ``appropriate in the interests of a fair and orderly market''and to protect investors.\116\<NOTE/> This proposal is based on the assumption that accurate pricesmay be based only upon accurate pricing of the underlying portfolios. TheCommission believes that this proposal is consistent with the Act.\117\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\116\<T3>See, </T3><T3>e.q., </T3>Phlx Rule 1047A. A trading halt in the primary market forunderlying stocks accounting for 20% or more (in the case of CBOE) or 50%or more (in the case of Amex) of the portfolio value now will be one ofseveral factors that may be considered by the exchanges in determiningwhether to halt trading in the IP. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\117\The recent Commission approval of proposed rule changessubmitted by the NYSE, Phlx, Amex, and CBOE to halt trading on the exchangesfor one hour if the Dow Jones Industrial Average (``DJIA'') declines 250or more points from its previous day's close and an additional two hoursif the DJIA declines 400 points from its previous day's close (``circuitbreaker'' proposals) would be applicable to IPs. In this regard, the Phlxcircuit breaker proposal does not alter existing Exchange trading haltand suspension rules. <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26386 (December 22, 1988),53 FR 52904. Thus, when the circuit breaker is activated Phlx Rule 1047A,which applies to CIP trading, will cause trading in CIPs to be halted becausemore than 20% of the value of the underlying security is not trading. Inaddition, the Amex circuit breaker proposal provides that all securitieswill halt trading on the exchange when the predetermined limits are reached.<T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26198 (October 19, 1988),53 FR 41637. Because the Amex proposed EIP rule change defines the instrumentas a security, EIPs will halt trading when the circuit breaker is activated.Moreover, although CBOE's circuit breaker proposal provides for the cessationof trading in stock options and stock index options when the predeterminedlimits are reached, the proposed CBOE VIP rules provide that VIP's willhalt trading when 20% of the value of the underlying security is not trading.Thus, when the circuit breaker proposal halts trading on the Exchange VIPsalso will cease trading. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Regulation T </ITAG>The initial sale of an IP, by definition, will require the seller to goshort. Accordingly, it is necessary to determine what margin treatmentfor IPs is appropriate. In this regard, the Phlx, CBOE, and Amex requestedan interpretation from the FRB\118\<NOTE/> that IPs be treated as equity securities rather than securitiesoptions under the relevant provisions of Regulation T.\119\<NOTE/> The FRB's staff has issued a letter not objecting to thecommencement of IPs trading employing the proposed initial (50% marginfor IP purchases and 150% margin for IP shorts) and maintenance (130% ofthe value of all short IP positions and 25% of the value of all IP longpositions maintained in customer margin accounts) margin for IPs.\120\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\118\<T3>See, </T3><T3>e.q., </T3>Letters to Laura Homer, Securities Credit Officer, FRB fromRichard Chase, Executive Vice President, Phlx (February 3, 1988) and fromGordon L. Nash, Senior Executive Vice President, Legal and Regulatory Affairs,Amex (March 8, 1989). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\119\<T3>See </T3>12 CFR 220.5(c) and 220.18 (a), (c), and (f) (1988). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\120\<T3>See </T3>Letter from Laura Homer, Securities Credit Officer, FRB, toRichard Ketchum, Director, Division of Market Regulation, SEC, dated March20, 1989. The exchanges proposed rule changes also contemplate the useof escrow receipts as cover for IP short positions and special margin treatmentfor certain market strategies. Currently, the exchanges and the FRB arein the process of working out such details. Thus, amendments to the marginregulations may be necessary. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Clearance and Settlement </ITAG>The exchanges propose to have IPs cleared and settled by the OCC. In thisregard, on March 3, 1988, the OCC filed with the Commission a proposedrule change to enable the OCC to issue, clear, and settle index participations.\121\<NOTE/> The proposal will allow the OCC to process IP transactionsin accordance with procedures that are substantially similar to OCC's well-establishedsystems and procedures.\122\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\121\<T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 25529 (March 29, 1988),53 FR 10960. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\122\The Commission approved the OCC's proposed rule changeto issue, clear, and settle IPs simultaneously with the exchanges' proposedrule changes to list and trade IPs. <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26713 (April 11, 1989).<ITAG tagnum="84">V.
