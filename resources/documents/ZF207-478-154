 Verity also revealed that it has raised $6.4 million inequity financing from venture capital groups.andM;The new Topic release adds three extensions to the original product, whichoffers an object-based approach to full-text retrieval.andP;  The new features area real-time system for linking to live data sources; hypertext links toannotations, images or cross-references to other documents; and integrationwith other applications, particularly databases.andM;Topic hyperlinks.andP;  Verity has added a mechanism for inserting dynamiccross-references, or hypertext links, within indexed documents.andP;  These linksare iconified to distinguish them from the text.andP;  Clicking on an iconactivates the link and automatically takes you to the cross-reference, whichmight be another document not found in the original search, annotations orgraphic images.andM;Coinciding with the links is the ability to retrieve images as part of adocument through Verity's new Topic Image Filters.andP;  Formats supported includeTIFF, PC-X, Sun Raster and PDA.andP;  Verity has also developed its own image fileformat, VIF.andM;Real-time system.andP;  In time-sensitive applications, finding information fromyesterday's index is not current enough when you're looking for somethingthat happened today.andP;  Now Topic supports live documents from dynamic datasources, matching the content of the live data to premade user profiles.andM;Using the program's tools for creating a retrieval topic, the user creates aprofile.andP;  As five documents are captured by the system, their content isindexed and then matched against user profiles and routed to the appropriatequeues, along with a mail notice.andM;The real-time system is currently being beta-tested at a large commercialbank, but it has considerable potential in the daily newspaper setting.andO;Newswire feeds could be hooked up to the system; it would then route thestories not only by their headlines or slugs but also by their content, whichwould be matched against user profiles.andM;Other time-sensitive applications include financial analysis, tradingoperations and intelligence gathering.andM;Extending and integrating.andP;  Verity is both an OEM and an end-user supplier.andO;It handles most of its integration with other applications on a custom basis.andO;Text is stored in a flat ASHII file, indexed and retrieved through Topic.andO;But as an OEM, Verity would like its software to be integrated into otherprograms, much as Fulcrum Technologies does with its full-text retrievalsoftware.andM;To get the program rolling, Verity has announced the Topic ApplicationProgram Interface (API), a library of C function calls that VARs, systemintegrators and software developers can use to embed Topic into theirapplications.andP;  The API provides a consistent call interface to Topic'sdifferent modules, making the integrator's job a little easier.andM;At the same time, Verity has begun production shipments of an SQL bridgebetween Topic and the relational databases Oracle, Ingres, Sybase andInformix.andP;  With this facility, the user can embed SQL-structured queries intothe search, which may specify one or more databases on the net.andP;  The databasequery may be mixed with topics and text queries, thereby extending theinformation search across both structured and unstructured databases.andM;Verity expects to complete beta testing of version 2.0 in time to beginproduction shipments next month.andP;  Retrieval software costs $695 forIBM-compatible PCs and $2,500 for Sun workstations.andP;  Typical configurations,which include a database builder and database servers as well as retrievalsoftware, range in price from $7,500 to $110,000, depending on the platformand number of seats.andP;  The Topic Real-Time System is similarly priced startingat $15,000.andP;  The Topic SQL-Bridge is $2,500.andM;Second-round financing.andP;  Verity was focused last year as a spin-off fromAdvanced Decision Systems, a subcontractor to the U.S.andP;  federal government.andO;In short order, the company released Topic as a commercial product,established its key reference accounts, built a direct sales and supportorganization and secured alliances with several vendors, including most ofthe major Unix relational database software suppliers.andP;  Now it is intent onmaking itself the number one company in electronic retrieval, a field thathas never had a dominating name, although Basis is probably the best-knownproduct in the field.andP;  To do that, Verity secured a second round of financingto fund a major marketing and sales effort.andM;The new equity investment, $6.4 million, is spreawd among six investors.andP;  Theoriginal three--U.S.andP;  Venture Partners, Olympic Venture Partners and GrotechManagement--were joined this time by Hambrecht andamp; Quist, Asset Management andChancellor Capital Management.andP;  Combined with the $3 million invested lastyear, the total invested in the company is $9.4 million.andM;Verity has a few key technological edges over its competition.andP;  One is thatits software is designed to run in a distributed network.andP;  The retrievalsoftware acts as the client, initiating searches routed by database serversto anywhere on the network.andP;  The software is fast, and users don't have toknow where information is in order to find it.andM;Another key is its novel approach to searching for topics, rather thancharacter strings.andP;  Verity calls this concept retrieval, a method that ismore precise yet easier to use than other lookup methods.andM;Finally, the company has been quick to get its product accepted into largecorporate accounts, a critical step in the success of any startup.andP;  Now itfaces the daunting challenge of convincing the market at large that aone-year company is the new market dealer.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
