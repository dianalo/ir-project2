The storm bore down hardest on North Carolina, where whipped seafoam covered beaches like a blanket of snow. Winds gusted up to 70mph and waves crested at nearly 25 feet off Cape Hatteras. Noserious injuries were reported.   Forecasters were uncertain how long the storm would linger offthe coast, meteorologist Harry Gordon at the National WeatherService's Severe Storms Forecast Center in Kansas City, Mo., saidtoday.   In Sandbridge, Va., Dick Schumacher said his $200,000 oceanfronthome tumbled into the surf, and officials said about 20 other homeswere threatened by high water and pounding surf.   ``My house is in the ocean. It's finished,'' Schumacher saidWednesday night. ``I'm heartsick.''   About 5,000 people, mostly in Virginia Beach, temporarily lostelectricity in the storm, which also tore up roads and washed outtrees, road signs and utility poles and toppled portions of atleast four houses. Tides rose to their highest level in six years,officials said.   By this morning, the storm was far enough off the coast forwinds to die down, and residents began cleaning up the tons ofdebris from their scoured beaches.   The northeaster, which takes its name from the prevailing winddirection during the storm, pushes tides to abnormal heights,eroding beaches and turning storm drains into geysers.   ``The wind literally forces the water up against the coast,''said Terry Ritter, meteorologist in charge of the Norfolk office ofthe National Weather Service.   Flood warnings also were issued for the Delaware and Marylandcoasts.   In Ocean City, Md., police reported minor flooding. Policespokesman Jay Hancock said the water was very high, and it wasdifficult to say how much beach has eroded until the water goesdown. No beachfront properties were damaged, however.   At least one cottage in North Carolina fell into the ocean, andstate Highway 12 was closed late Wednesday, stranding some OuterBanks residents in the town of Manteo overnight, said T.C.McKimmey, of the Dare County Sheriff's Department.   ``The cottage already had suffered severe erosion and had beenleaning last spring, but the storm took the final toll,'' McKimmeysaid. Several other houses also were threatened by waters thatrolled over the beach road in Nags Head.   Heavy surf washed away about 100 feet of sand from the southside of Oregon Inlet, threatening to damage the approach to theHerbert C. Bonner Bridge that leads to Hatteras Island, about 20miles off the North Carolina coast.   Further erosion could wash away much of the sand from SouthPoint, exposing the bridge and approach to direct waves, highwayofficials said.   ``That point is the protection for our south bridge abutment,''state Highway Administrator George Wells said. ``The ocean iseating away rapidly at that point.''   Aides said Gov. Jim Martin planned to fly to the coast todaywith highway officials to survey the damage.   At Carolina Beach, N.C., heavy rain and wind caused erosionalmost as fast as a dredge pumped sand in a $1.4 million beachreplenishment project.   ``We're losing sand fast due to this inclement weather,'' TownManager David Serrell said. ``It happened almost overnight, butthere's nothing you can do about it. I don't know how much is beinglost in dollar figures.''   In Virginia, the Downtown Tunnel between Norfolk and Portsmouthwas closed for three hours Wednesday as water in the tube rose ashigh as 7 inches. The flooding was caused by water that poured intoan electrical junction box left uncapped by construction workers,state Transportation Department spokesman John Hanke said.   ``It was a combination of freak occurrences that will neverhappen again in a million years,'' Hanke said.</TEXT></DOC>
