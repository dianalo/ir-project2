Too Short member Todd Shaw, 23, of Hayward, Calif., and NWAmembers Osea ``Ice Cube'' Jackson, 20, of Los Angeles, and LorenzoPatterson, 22, of Long Beach, Calif., also were ordered to pay $30each in court costs.   Two other NWA members also faced municipal court hearings on thecharges. Antoine Carraby, 27, of Compton, Calif., was to appeartoday, and Eric ``Eazy-E'' Wright, 25, also of Compton, is scheduledfor a hearing Monday.   Municipal Judge Harry H. McIlwain on Tuesday rejected a motion todismiss the case on grounds the charges violated the performers'freedom of speech rights. The judge stayed the fines for 30 days tolet the performers appeal.   ``I want you to appeal, and I just hope the courts don't make thesame kind of mistake with this that they did with the decision toallow burning the American flag,'' McIlwain told lawyers for theperformers, who didn't appear in court.   Defense Attorney Louis Sirkin conceded that the performersrepeatedly asked members of the youthful audience to come onto thestage to engage in sex acts, but said that didn't constitutedisorderly conduct.   ``What may be offensive to some is entertainment to others,''Sirkin said.   Ernest McAdams Jr., assistant city prosecutor, retorted, ``TheFirst Amendment was not designed to protect people ... from publicobscenity charges.''</TEXT></DOC>
