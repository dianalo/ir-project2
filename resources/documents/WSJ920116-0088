In a report on how good fish go bad too often in the U.S.,the consumer advocacy group warns that much of what we buy atthe seafood counter is spoiled, tainted or mislabeled.</LP><TEXT>   The group, which tested fish sold in the metropolitan NewYork and Chicago areas, found that almost 30% of the sampleswere spoiled and another 9% were on the verge of decaying. Italso found many fish tainted with harmful chemicals and otherpollutants, and said that about one-third of the fish weremisbranded, either deliberately or out of ignorance.   The six-month investigation raises troubling questionsabout product wholesomeness and healthfulness at a time whenAmericans are eating more fish -- 15.5 pounds a year, onaverage -- than ever. In particular, Consumers Union said itfound widespread disregard for the fish industry'squality-control maxim -- &quot;keep it cold, keep it clean, keepit moving&quot; -- at various stages in the distribution chain,from the fishing boat to the supermarket.   The group defined as spoiled any fish having bacteriacounts exceeding 10 million colonies per gram. Nearly 25% ofthe samples were off the chart in a test that had an upperlimit of 27 million colonies per gram.   &quot;Time and temperature are the enemies of freshness andflavor,&quot; says the report. &quot;Most fish have a shelf-life ofseven to 12 days at best once they are out of water. But thefish that reaches your dinner table may have been out as longas 15 days.&quot;   The effects of inadequate refrigeration and slow handlingcan only be masked for so long. &quot;In Chicago, for example, thetuna sold in several supermarkets was greenish brown anddull, suggesting the fish had been sitting around for severaldays,&quot; Consumers Union said.   The $3.5 billion fish industry is dreading the consumerimpact of the report. The National Fisheries Institute, atrade group representing 4,100 seafood producers, processors,distributors and brokers, assails the Consumer Union findingsas &quot;exaggerated&quot; and flawed by &quot;poor methodology.&quot;   &quot;We feel strongly that the nation's supply of seafood isinherently safe and wholesome,&quot; asserts Lee Weddig, executivevice president of the group. &quot;It's invalid to infer that ahigh percentage of the fish . . . is spoiled, when such asweeping conclusion is based on geographically andnumerically limited sample and inappropriate analyticalmethods.&quot;   Consumers Union took a total of 113 samples from twometropolitan areas. That doesn't make a representativesampling of fish and shellfish nationwide, says Mr. Weddig.   He also argues that the bacteria test used by ConsumersUnion is imprecise and of limited value as an indicator ofproduct quality. Not all bacteria counted by the testactually cause spoilage, he notes. In addition, fish with theidentical bacteria counts vary in quality.   In the Consumers Union survey, nearly half of the fishsamples tested -- 44% -- were somewhat contaminated withfecal coliform bacteria from human or animal wastes, withcounts exceeding 10 per gram. Fully 22% of the samples hadcounts greater than 100 per gram, and 15% had counts greaterthan 500. Most of the latter came from New York area stores.   The Interstate Shellfish Sanitation Conference, whichoversees state regulation of fisheries and seafoodprocessing, draws the line at three fecal bacteria per gram.Some fecal bacteria are disease-causing organisms; forinstance, certain E. coli strains produce severe diarrhea.   A lot of the fish tested had been tainted by potentiallyharmful chemicals and other pollutants that foul U.S. waters,the Consumers Union report says. Polychlorinated biphenyls,or PCBs, which have been found to cause cancer in laboratoryanimals, were detected in 43% of the salmon tested, 25% ofthe swordfish and 50% of the lake whitefish. But Mr. Weddigpoints out that only a few samples barely exceeded the Foodand Drug Administration limit of two parts per million.   Traces of mercury, which in high concentrations can harmthe nervous system, were found in 90% of the swordfishtested. The average level was 1.14 parts per million, a shadeabove the FDA limit of one part per million, according to thereport. Some samples of catfish and whitefish containedresidues of DDT and other pesticides. A number of clamsamples had relatively high levels of lead.   Illustrating its findings that fish often are inaccuratelyidentified, the report says it caught several fishmongerstrying to cash in on red snapper's appeal. A relativelyscarce species, red snapper brings $8 to $14 a pound, whileother snappers bring just $3 to $4 a pound. The result:inexpensive fish frequently are passed off as the coveted redsnapper.   Consumers Union also dubs one ruse the &quot;salmonshenanigans.&quot; Last spring, after the U.S. imposed aprohibitive tariff on salmon imports from Norway, retailersbegan selling salmon from Canada, Chile and Maine as thepopular &quot;Norwegian salmon.&quot;   Some fishmongers also have a penchant for marketing frozenfish as fresh while letting it thaw in the display cases, thegroup reports.</TEXT></DOC>
