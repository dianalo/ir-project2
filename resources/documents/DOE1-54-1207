This method employs an weighted diamond differenceapproximation, the weight in which is a function of neutron directionand scalar flux, and can be easily incorpolated into conventional discreteordinates transport codes. Results obtained in four-group S/sub 4/P/sub0/ calculations on simple fast reactors indicate that, though the computertime of this method has increased by 30 {similar_to} 50 % compared withthat of the conventional finite difference method using the same mesh,the errors of k/sub eff/ and the power distribution are reduced remarkably.</TEXT></DOC>
