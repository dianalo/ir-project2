 In other words, while operatingwithin any of the common word processors, the user can write a letter andhave it overlaid on the stationery created with Letterhead.andP;  Elements thatcan be employed include backgrounds, borders, vignettes, text and companylogos.andM;A nice application is overheads, where each slide can be given the sameunifying look by overlaying a company logo or other graphic.andP;  Or it can beused to overlay a header on a sheet used for facsimile transmissions.andM;Any element in EPS, PICT, Paint, Glue or TIFF format can be accommodated.andM;Each letterhead created with the program has three pages: one design for thefirst page and one each for odd and even pages.andM;The program comes with more than 30 predefined styles that can be modifiedand used.andP;  It is possible also to create new ones from scratch.andM;Letterhead is selected from the Macintosh control panel.andP;  The particularLetterhead style to overlay is selected from a dialog box while theapplication is open.andP;  The letter can be previewed prior to printing.andM;Letterhead will be available in the second quarter of 1991 for $100.andM;Delrina performs under Windows 3andM;Appearing in the IBM booth, Delrina showed the latest versions of its PerFormsoftware, including the Pro version running under Windows 3.0, with AgfaIntellifont technology for scaling font outlines and Agfa's Type Director formanaging fonts.andP;  Delrina now offers two versions: PerForm, under Gem, andPerForm Pro, under Windows.andP;  Each of them consists of two modules--Designer,for designing forms, and Filler, for filling them.andP;  It is possible to buy onecopy of Designer and multiple copies of the less-expensive Filler program tospread out the task of filling forms created by the design department.andM;PerForm Pro is packed with new features, aimed primarily at a higher-end userthan has been targeted in the past.andP;  The resulting package is extremelyimpressive, providing a nice combination of design tools, databasefunctionality and quick fill-in of created forms.andM;The database facilities have been extended to support writing data indelimited ASCII and dBase formats.andP;  Data entered in those formats is kept inthe original database format for later use.andP;  Paradox will be supported later,Delrina said.andM;Data management within PerForm also has been enhanced.andP;  Multiple forms thatare stored in the same folder can be linked to different databases.andO;Information common to multiple forms need be stored only once.andM;Another new item is a display of information about each form--description,version, date, etc.--available by clicking on the form in the directory.andM;PerForm Pro adds electronic signatures to encrypt forms by password toprotect or hide fields.andP;  When one person signs a form in one field, thatfield can be forever locked to further changes.andP;  It also provides an easymeans of knowing who approved the form or specific parts of it.andM;It is possible also to lock a form in its current state, never to be changedby anyone.andP;  If there is a chance that the form will have to be modifiedlater, it is wise to keep the unlocked original and lock only a copy.andP;  Ofcourse, individual fields and elements can be protected to prevent changes.andM;The form also can perform about 70 different mathematical calculations, someof which are user defined.andP;  Functions include absolute value, average andif/then/else.andM;The Filler program includes a draft mode, called FastFill, for quickerfilling in of forms.andM;Delrina has worked to speed up the printing process.andP;  One change is an optionnot to print nonfilled pages.andP;  When operating in PCL mode, printing runsfaster by calling line drawing and PCL commands directly.andP;  It also ispossible to download a form as a macro to reside in the printer.andP;  Then, toprint the form with data, it is necessary only to send the data to theprinter, not the entire form.andP;  This function isn't supported in PostScriptmode.andM;The Designer module has been simplified by incorporating many functions ontomenus.andP;  Other additions include the ability to repeat objects (such as logos)on multiple pages of a form, allowing the toolbox to be moved on the screen,enabling the assignment of colors to create fountains or vignettes, theability to move elements on the screen visually or by typing a value in adialog box, generation of round-cornered boxes, support for additionalgraphics formats (Windows BMP and EPSF) and automatic insertion of items suchas parentheses for telephone area codes.andM;If text is added to a field beyond the space available within the field, theform grows dynamically to make more space.andP;  A conditional fill-in feature canalter the rest of a form based on the way a particular field was filled in.andM;Two clipboards are available: the standard Windows one, which can be used tomove items between programs, and Delrina's own, which can carry additionalinformation about the structure of a form with elements it moves.andM;Delrina announced a cooperative effort with Andromeda Software--the developerof the Streamline raster-to-vector conversion program now sold by Adobe--tooffer an autotrace capability that could be used to scan a form and create anelectronic version.andP;  It currently is possible to trace a form manually.andM;The new font capability, using Agfa's Intellifont technology and TypeDirector program, make it possible for the user to create commonly used fontsfor fast access, as well as to generate any others on the fly as needed.andM;PerForm 2.1 for Gem.andP;  The enhancements to the Gem version are much lesssubstantial than those to Pro, but they were the result of feedback from theuser base.andP;  They include faster operation, auto scrolling as text is typed,Bitstream Fontware to generate screen and printer fonts, smaller incrementsin comb spacing to correspond to a grid, user choice of RETURN or TAB keysfor proceeding through fields and flexible page margins.andM;For both programs, more than 100 customizable templates are provided forcommonly used forms.andM;Pricing.andP;  The PerForm Pro Designer and Filler package costs $495 ($99 as anupgrade from the original package).andP;  The Pro version of Filler alone sellsfor $199.andP;  PerForm Designer and Filler for Gem is priced at $295, with itsFiller companion at $129.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
