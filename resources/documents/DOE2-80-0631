A study of the FEMAcharger designs to see if significant cost reductions might be possiblewithout any compromise in the function of the chargers was undertaken.It was found that the existing designs were functionally very acceptable,but that the costs were significantly increased by three factors: requirementsfor precision machined components; a relatively complicated assemblyprocess; and failure to make optimum use of equivalent commercially availablecomponents instead of calling for custom designed and fabricated parts.By careful attention to these factors a modified design was developedwhich reduced parts costs by an estimated $134 per unit (from $198 to$64), with near identical form, operation, and function; in addition,estimated assembly costs were greatly reduced.</TEXT></DOC>
