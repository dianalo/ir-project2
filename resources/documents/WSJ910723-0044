Under federal law, the RTC can't award business to firmsthat contributed to the thrift crisis. But Coopers andamp; Lybrandagreed to pay the government on July 3, before the FederalDeposit Insurance Corp. filed suit against it.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We can't penalize firms for settling potential lawsuits,&quot;said John Dolan, deputy of the Federal Deposit InsuranceCorp.'s contract business review office. Under thesettlement, the firm denied wrongdoing in the 1986 and 1987audits of Silverado under question.   The RTC is paying Coopers andamp; Lybrand $1.5 million to manage8,000 troubled loans and real estate projects in Arkansas,the remnants of 10 defunct thrifts in the state. A Coopers andamp;Lybrand spokesman termed the work &quot;a significant engagement.&quot;   For its part, the RTC needs Big Six accountingcapabilities. A year ago, with five of the six facing bans,the RTC granted waivers to firms promising to isolate new RTCwork from partners and offices involved in old lawsuits.   Still, regulators refused waivers to Big Six firms subjectto multiple lawsuits or particularly serious allegations. TheRTC said it has let contracts to all but Deloitte andamp; Toucheand Ernst andamp; Young. Deloitte confirmed it had no contracts.Ernst andamp; Young couldn't be reached for comment.</TEXT></DOC>
