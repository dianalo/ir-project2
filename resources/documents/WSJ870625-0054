The plans provide for staggered terms of office for directors and require greater-than-majority votes for some business combinations unless approved by directors or minimum price standards are met. Proposals to raise the limit on unsecured debt and permit the company to issue variable rate preferred stock failed, the utility said. The annual meeting was May 27, but proxy mailings were delayed by a Securities and Exchange Commission review. Voting was extended to June 24. </TEXT></DOC>
