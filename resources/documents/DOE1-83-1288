<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-83-1288 </DOCNO><TEXT>Discusses temperature gradients and methods for temperature control usedor planned in the Upper Silesia, Lower Silesia and Lublin coal basins.Coal output from mining levels at depths exceeding 750 m and 1,000 mwill grow from 8.6 Mt and 1.5 Mt respectively in 1986 to 43.0 Mt and4.4 Mt respectively by the year 2,000. In the Upper Silesia basin 20.3%of developed coal reserves is situated in strata with a natural temperatureof 40-50/sup o/C, 12.3% of reserves is in strata with a temperature exceeding50/sup o/C. In the Upper Silesia and Lower Silesia basins about 1/3 ofdeveloped coal reserves is situated in rock strata with a natural temperatureexceeding 40/sup o/C. Deep mines with a high rock temperature in UpperSilesia are evaluated. The GUC-250 B air conditioning equipment usedin Polish black coal mining is characterized. Twelve units were usedin coal mines in 1986. In the future about 5 units of the GUC-250 and3 to 4 units of the GUC-740 P (being developed) will be manufacturedand installed in coal mines per year. 5 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
