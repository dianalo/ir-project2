Consumer groups and gas distributors say the FederalEnergy Regulatory Commission's action in 1986, raising theceiling price on so-called old gas, has already resulted in awindfall for natural gas producers. But the producers' tradegroup, the Natural Gas Supply Association, said the action&quot;promises to give consumers the most competitive pricepossible.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Old gas is gas produced from wells that were already inoperation when the Natural Gas Policy Act took effect Nov. 8,1978. Congress set higher price ceilings for so-called newgas, gas that would come from newer wells, and lower ceilingsfor old gas. But the 1978 federal law also preserved 15different categories of old gas with varying price ceilingsbased on the age of the wells.   In 1986, the FERC concluded that the ceilings for old gaswere so low that producers were abandoning old wells, leavinghuge untapped reserves and prompting greater reliance onimports and higher-priced new wells. The FERC issued tworegulations that eliminated the 15 separate categories,consolidated old gas into one category and raised themaximum, or ceiling price that could be charged for old gas.The commission also required producers to renegotiate theircontracts, instead of merely charging the new higher ceilingprice.   A number of pipeline companies, distributors and consumergroups challenged the commission's authority for theregulations, saying that Congress didn't give the agency theright to overhaul the price structure.   A federal appeals court in New Orleans ruled, 2-1, inSeptember 1989 that the commission exceeded its authorityover old gas in the two 1986 regulations. Yesterday, the highcourt, 8-0, reversed the appeals court ruling. JusticeAnthony Kennedy didn't participate in the case.   In the decision, Justice Byron White said Congress gavethe FERC &quot;broad rate-making authority.&quot; Justice White saidthat Congress required only that the commission's ratedecisions be &quot;just and reasonable.&quot; He said, &quot;Congressclearly meant to preserve the pricing flexibility thecommission had historically exercised.&quot;   FERC Chairman Martin Allday said the ruling is a&quot;watershed event&quot; that will bolster the rule-makingcredibility of his commission, which often has beensecond-guessed in the courts, and will free the commission totackle other pending natural gas issues.   Carter Phillips, a Washington lawyer who appealed to theSupreme Court on behalf of nearly two dozen natural gasproducers, said, &quot;The natural gas producing industry isdelighted with the outcome.&quot; He said that most disputesbetween producers and pipeline companies have been resolved.If the Supreme Court had ruled against the commission, hesaid, &quot;it would have been a nightmare&quot; trying to reopencontracts that had already been renegotiated and calculatingnew rates.   Edwin Rothschild, energy policy director of CitizenAction, a consumer group, agreed that it would have beendifficult to &quot;unscramble&quot; several thousand contracts if thejustices had struck down the FERC rules. But he said thecourt's decision &quot;is very disappointing. The rule gives awindfall to producers on gas that would otherwise have beensold at lower prices.&quot; (Mobil Oil Exploration and ProducingSoutheast Inc. vs. United Distribution Cos.; FERC vs. UnitedDistribution Cos.)</TEXT></DOC>
