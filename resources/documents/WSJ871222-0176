She cuts, then perms my hair. The change is so radical that I egg her on.    &quot;Make me blond,&quot; I say.    Ms. Blair is gleeful. &quot;Let's try red, instead,&quot; she suggests.    Before I know it, I am a bare-lipped redhead with a permanent wave -- in short, a buffoon. I peer at my new self and think, gee, I'm glad I never did anything this stupid.    I can say that because my transformation was accomplished without scissors, razors or dyes. Using a sophisticated $20,000 video computer, Ms. Blair digitized my face, projected the image on a monitor, replaced my hair style with a style stored in the computer's memory, smoothed out my new look with an electronic pen and then printed the whole thing on paper.    Looking at this preview of a possible new me, I tell Ms. Blair that I have seen the future and it is ugly.    Ms. Blair, an independent consultant who works out of the Personal Touch beauty salon here, isn't discouraged. &quot;I tell all my customers it's as important to know what doesn't work as it is to know what looks nice,&quot; she says.    Having made people quicker, smarter and richer, computers are now being used to make them better-looking as well. Ms. Blair, who charges $25 for a 45-minute imaging consultation, is one of a growing number of entrepreneurs hoping to cash in. From a trickle of relatively unsophisticated gadgets four years ago, a variety of computerized imaging systems have emerged to aid people in picking hair styles and makeup, project the results of cosmetic dentistry, and help plastic surgeons plan and preview face lifts and make detailed video records of their patients' progress.    So far, the systems account for only a blip in computer sales. In the medical segment, for example, only about 250 of the nation's 6,200 plastic and cosmetic surgeons use imaging systems. But the potential is huge. Half of the nation's 260,000 beauty salons probably have enough customers to justify buying the systems, even at the current $15,000 average price.    Moreover, entrepreneurs on the front line of the nascent &quot;personal care&quot; computer industry are looking at even broader markets. Inamed Corp., whose principal business is making cosmetic surgery implants, has sold 80 imaging systems to plastic and cosmetic surgeons and has begun a push into general dentistry and orthodontia, which have about 155,000 practitioners.    The company, which is based in Santa Barbara, Calif., is also toying with a system that would show people how they will look if they lose weight. &quot;They can take home a picture, paste it on the refrigerator and have a real incentive to skip the salami sandwich they're thinking about eating,&quot; says Michael Null, the president of Inamed's McGhan Instrumed Corp. subsidiary.    New Image Industries Inc., a closely held 10-month-old start-up, has already delivered about 500 hair-salon systems. Now it hopes to tap the potentially vast architectural and interior-design trades by showing &quot;how the pool will fit into your back yard or what the wallpaper will look like before you put it up,&quot; says Robert Gurevitch, the president of the Woodland Hills, Calif., concern.    Video-imaging computers trace their origins to Pac-Man and the computer-graphics technology that started the video-game revolution. Essentially, the systems blend state-of-the-art video cameras and customized software with off-the-shelf computer hardware -- typically a 20-megabyte high-speed personal computer and a color-graphics board capable of digitizing video signals.    Some people believe that the systems are just a fad. The industry is so new -- probably 90% of the systems in use have been sold within the past two years -- that few analysts are even aware of it. But those who have watched it longest -- analysts in the $15 billion cosmetic industry, where imaging systems first appeared four years ago -- aren't convinced that the imaging wave will last any longer than last year's hair style.    The systems may make sense in medical fields, where large fees can support one-time use by patients, says Brenda Lee Landry, who tracks the cosmetics industry for Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. But, she says, hair-care and cosmetic retailers have to rely on volume and repeat business for profit. &quot;Once a person has had a session, I don't see them going back -- it tends to be a one-shot deal.&quot;    &quot;People do this as a goof,&quot; adds Jack L. Salzman, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. He points to the experience of cosmetic giant Elizabeth Arden Inc. It rotates about a dozen computerized makeup simulators -- some of them costing $100,000 -- among scores of department stores so that the novelty won't wear off. As gimmicks, &quot;these things get people into the department stores,&quot; says Mr. Salzman. But, he adds, &quot;I just don't see women constantly flocking to a machine so they can stare at a humongous pore in their skin while deciding on the right moisturizer.&quot;    Imaging-system makers counter that recent price competition in the computer industry will continue to drive down component costs, making systems ever more affordable. One example: Simple dentistry simulators sell for as little as $6,000 today, compared with double that two years ago.    Some of the biggest believers are users. Mitch Mitchell, a salon owner and computer buff, had such faith in imaging technology that he spent $17,000 to build his own system last April. Since then, he has averaged 90 imaging customers a month, at $30 a sitting, in his Irvine, Calif., salon.    Mr. Mitchell believes that his system not only sells haircuts -- 75% of his imaging customers have stayed to get their hair done -- but also has virtually eliminated the most common stylist-customer conflict: misunderstanding over what is possible. &quot;It's hard to have somebody in a chair and say to them, 'You have a horse face, the style you're describing will never look good on you,'&quot; he says. &quot;On the computer, however, you can show them: 'If we do this style, your face still looks long. But if we do this, we get a nice oval.'&quot;    Mr. Mitchell concedes that he gets virtually no repeat imaging customers, but he says, &quot;they'll come back in a couple of years when the styles change again.&quot;    Larry D. Schoenrock, a Santa Rosa, Calif., facial plastic surgeon, has used computer imaging with about 700 patients. He says that the system's chief benefit is allowing patients to get a more realistic expectation of results. One of his patients, hairdresser Chava Enos, agrees. She was afraid that the surgery she was contemplating might leave her looking like &quot;somebody completely different.&quot; Instead, her portrait on Dr. Schoenrock's imaging system showed only subtle changes. &quot;I appeared more rested and I liked that,&quot; she says. &quot;It alleviated a lot of stress.&quot;    Still, some doctors caution that imaging systems can raise ethical and even legal issues if they aren't used conservatively. William Beeson, the public-information chairman for the American Academy for Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, worries that the systems can produce patient images that sell surgery but are impossible to deliver. &quot;If you program them for results that can't be achieved,&quot; Dr. Beeson says, &quot;you're going to have a problem.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
