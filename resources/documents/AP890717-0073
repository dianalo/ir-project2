Bush said Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev already is ``movingin our direction, coming our way'' and he urged the Kremlin to charta course ``that brings itself into the community of nations.''   Bush spoke hopefully of the prospects for political and economicreforms throughout Eastern Europe in a speech delivered in thishistoric North Sea city where Rembrandt worked, Hugo Grotiusformulated theories of international law and the Pilgrims soughtexile before sailing for the New World.   ``The challenge we face is clear,'' Bush said. ``We must worktogether toward the day when all of Europe, East and West, is freeof discord, free of division.''   Thousands of cheering Dutch people lined Bush's motorcade routethrough Leiden waving American and Dutch flags. A banner strung overthe route read, ``Leiden is Georgeous.'' Other hand-held signscriticized U.S. policy in Central America and demanded that abortionbe kept legal.   Bush joked later, ``I'm not sure about some of those signs I sawcoming in. It reminded me of my own university, however.''   Bush toured an exhibit of Pilgrim artifacts and was presentedwith a partial family tree showing he is descended from at least twoPilgrims who lived in Leiden before embarking for the New World inthe 1620s.   Bush arrived in the Netherlands, the last stop on his 10-dayEuropean tour, after visiting Poland and Hungary and attendingeconomic summit talks in Paris, where the seven richest industrialdemocracies received a Gorbachev proposal for integrating the Sovieteconomy with that of the West.   Saying that dramatic changes were under way in Eastern Europe andthe Soviet Union, Bush cited Gorbachev's letter as ``only the latestexample of the Soviets' moving in our direction.''   Tracing the rebuilding of Western Europe from the rubble of WorldWar II, he said that ``the `other Europe' _ the Europe behind thewall _ endured four decades of privation and hardship, persecutionand fear.''   Said Bush:   ``Today that `other Europe' is changing. The great wheel ismoving once more. Our time _ the exciting time in which we live _ isa time of new hope, the hope that all of Europe can now know thefreedom that you all in the Netherlands has known, that America hasknown, and that the West has known.''   ``Our hope is that the unnatural division of Europe will now cometo an end, that the Europe behind the wall will join its neighborsto the West, prosperous and free,'' said Bush, making the firstvisit to the Netherlands by any American president.   He said Poland and Hungary are moving at the forefront ofpolitical and economic reform, traveling farther over the past yearthan anyone in the West once thought possible.   Delivering the last major speech of his European trip, Bush spokebefore several hundred people in Pieterskerk, the Church of St.Peter, a huge cathedral dating to the early 12th century, afterconferring with leaders in The Hague, the nearby seat of the Dutchgovernment.   He received an ovation at the conclusion of the speech.   The president said that during his visits in Eastern Europe, heheard ``new voices full of new hope. Theirs were the faces ofpilgrims on a journey, fixed on the horizon, on the new world cominginto view.   ``And they know, as we do, that ultimately, whatever the odds,freedom will succeed,'' he said.   Leiden is the community where religious dissidents from Englandtook refuge before they sailed seeking freedom in America. Theremains of the Rev. John Robinson, a Pilgrim leader, is buried inthe cathedral where Bush spoke.   ``Here in Leiden, where the Pilgrims dreamed their new world, letus pledge our effort to create a new world in Europe, whole andfree, a new world now within our reach,'' he said.   In this nation where protecting the environment is a major issue,Bush noted that the economic summit leaders focused for the firsttime this year on such problems as global warming, acid rain andocean pollution.   Bush said pollution respects no national boundaries. ``It's timefor nations to join forces in common defense of our environment,''he said. ``The United States will do its part.''   Bush delivered his address after receiving a 21-gun salute at anairport arrival ceremony in Amsterdam and having tea with QueenBeatrix at Noordeinde Palace at The Hague and meeting with PrimeMinister Ruud Lubbers.   The Netherlands, the first nation to establish ties with Americain 1782, is a staunch NATO ally that braved fierce public oppositionin agreeing to accept the basing of nuclear-tipped cruise missilesin 1985. The missiles were never deployed as a result of the 1987U.S.-Soviet treaty abolishing the medium-range weapons.   Bush held nearly an hour of talks at the Parliament with Lubbers,whose center-right coalition government collapsed in May over thefinancing of an environmental cleanup campaign, and was thrown intoa caretaker status pending elections Sept. 6.   Dutch politicians described Bush's visit as a ``pat on the back''for a loyal NATO ally. The president returns to Washington onTuesday.   At a post-summit news conference Sunday, Bush admitted he didn'tobject when the gathering was cut short after three days with thecancellation of a farewell dinner.   ``We're kind of running out of gas,'' Bush said. ``I'll tell you,it's been a vigorous experience in physical fitness for me'' whenthe summit and his participation in the French bicentennial werecoupled with the earlier stops in Eastern Europe.   Bush hailed the outcome of the summit and said its first-everfocus on environmental problems was a watershed.   The final summit communique called for ``decisive action'' tosave rain forests, the atmosphere, and the seas, lakes and rivers,saying species were endangered and societies threatened by damage.But it offered few specific proposals on how to accomplish thesegoals.   The document addressed a number of Bush initiatives, includingaid to Eastern Europe and endorsement of the administration's ThirdWorld debt plan. It also offered a general endorsement of his callfor help for Hungary and Poland.</TEXT></DOC>
