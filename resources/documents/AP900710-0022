SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Gen. Maxwell Thurman, the field commander incharge of the U.S. invasion of Panama, is being treated forsuspected leukemia at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, according tothe Pentagon.   Thurman, 59, will undergo additional tests ``to determine whattreatment may be appropriate,'' the Pentagon said Monday in a briefstatement.   The four-star general is head of the U.S. Southern Command,based in Panama, and is in charge of all U.S. forces in Central andSouth America.   The general took over the command on Sept. 30, 1989, and wasdubbed ``Mad Max'' for his feisty and aggressive style.   A native of High Point, N.C., and a graduate of North CarolinaState University at Raleigh, Thurman has served more than 36 yearsin the Army.   Besides his current position, he has served as the Army's vicechief of staff, its deputy chief of staff for personnel andcommander of the training and doctrine unit.   Thurman has been widely credited with convincing the Pentagonleadership and Bush administration to use military force inresponse to Gen. Manuel Noriega's regime in Panama.   He played a central role in drafting the plans for the Decemberinvasion along with the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen.Colin Powell.   The general was scheduled to take mandatory retirement August1989, but Defense Secretary Dick Cheney insisted he take over theSouthern Command and help with the administration's struggle todeal with Noriega in the wake of allegations the Panamaniandictator was involved in drug trafficking.   At the ceremony in which he took over the Southern Command,Thurman pledged he would confront ``tyranny in all its insidiousforms.''   The general made his mark as an aggressive, take-chargecommander ``who didn't hesitate to work around the clock,'' saidone Army source, who spoke on condition of not being identified.``He had this reputation for driving his staff crazy because he wasa bachelor and the guy never went home.''   Thurman earned high praise during his tenure at the helm of theArmy's Recruiting Command at Fort Sheridan, Ill., where he workedto develop the service's well-known ``Be All That You Can Be''campaign.   The Pentagon statement said the initial diagnosis was made asthe result of tests conducted on Friday and Monday at the hospitalin suburban Washington.   ``General Thurman has been admitted to confirm an initialdiagnosis of leukemia,'' the statement said.   Pentagon sources said the general was expected to remain at thehospital so that doctors could confirm their diagnosis.   ``He's wasn't feeling well and had been in and out of thehospital,'' said the Pentagon source. ``The earlier tests suggestedleukemia, and the more recent ones have helped confirm that.''   In Thurman's absence, the Southern Command's deputycommander-in-chief, Adm. David Chandler, will be in command, saidPentagon spokesman Pete Williams.   Asked whether Thurman will be able to resume his duties inPanama, Williams replied that Cheney ``will discuss that with Gen.Thurman when the secretary returns from his NATO visit later thisweek.''   Cheney, who was traveling to several NATO nations such as Norwayand Greece, was scheduled to return to Washington on Wednesday inorder to join budget discussions.  </TEXT></DOC>
