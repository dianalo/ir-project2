In his latest venture, the consumer activist isestablishing a coalition dedicated to finding free counselfor people who are hit with &quot;Slapps&quot; -- strategic lawsuitsagainst public participation.                                                                                                          Corporations and developers have filed hundreds of civilsuits against individuals or community groups in the pastdecade, Mr. Nader said. Usually, the plaintiffs allege libel,defamation, or interference with business in an effort tostop protesters from voicing criticism.   Targets of Slapp suits are varied: individuals whocomplain about development projects in letters to the editor,activists who lobby against industrial polluters,neighborhood groups that fight to uphold zoning restrictions.   For example, Betty Blake of Wantagh Woods, N.Y., was suedfor $6.5 million when she protested a developer's plan to cutdown oak trees on a proposed project. Ms. Blake organizedcandlelight vigils and circulated petitions. The developersued her for harassment and character defamation, buteventually dropped the case.   Consumer advocates call Slapp suits pure intimidation --&quot;blatant attempts by corporations to bully citizens intosilence,&quot; Mr. Nader said. But corporations' counsels callsuch suits self-defense. &quot;Your freedom of speech stops at thepoint where you libel or defame our product,&quot; said Kevin M.Reynolds, a partner in the Des Moines, Iowa, firm ofWhitfield, Musgrave andamp; Eddy.   &quot;With the economy in a recession, companies are findingthemselves in a very competitive atmosphere and they are moresensitive about product libel than they used to be,&quot; said Mr.Reynolds, who represents corporations in product liabilitycases. &quot;With the expansion of product-liability laws,companies have taken hard hits in verdicts and settlementsagainst them, and now they're saying they want to fightback.&quot;   But lawyers say that consumers probably don't needextensive legal help in defending against corporations'defamation suits. Most such suits are dismissed, often onFirst Amendment grounds, and few plaintiffs actually recoverdamages.   Libel of a corporation or product &quot;is a very, verydifficult tort to prove,&quot; said Washington insurance-defenselawyer Victor Schwartz. &quot;At some point, you have to let theindividual pop off -- often, you give more credence to{protesters'} statements by suing them than you would byignoring them.&quot;   Pointing to the low success rate, critics charge thatcompanies' real motivation in filing Slapp suits is tosilence critics, not to recover actual damages. A fewwell-publicized Slapp suits can scare others from speakingout, they say.   &quot;The suits have a chilling effect on any process thatrequires public participation,&quot; said Lawrence D. Bernfeld, anattorney who was sued for trying to galvanize public opinionagainst a nightclub in Manhattan. He represented a communitygroup and organized studies of the club's possible impact onthe neighborhood. &quot;Where do you draw the line? Should acommunity resident have to get a First Amendment lawyer toprescreen any comments he or she may wish to make in theprocess of public review?&quot;   A New York Supreme Court judge recently dismissed the suitagainst Mr. Bernfeld -- and even fined the nightclub forinitiating the legal action. &quot;A developer or business ownercannot be permitted to use the courts to stifle legitimateactivity by community groups,&quot; wrote Acting Justice Diane A.Lebedeff.   &quot;There is a serious threat to First Amendment rights fromlawsuits that harass individuals who have spoken out at townmeetings or in letters to the editor,&quot; said Floyd Abrams, anattorney at Cahill Gordon andamp; Reindel in New York.   While recognizing the right of companies to sueindividuals who might have damaged their business, Mr. Abramssaid that Slapp suit targets should &quot;respond in a militantfashion to unjust claims.&quot;   Following this approach, Mr. Nader is encouraging Slappdefendants to &quot;slap back&quot; by filing countersuits againstcompanies that they believe seek to intimidate them. In onecase, a man is suing a developer and its attorneys afterbeing sued over his protests, including letters to localnewspapers, against a Lake Tahoe, Calif., development. TheSlapp suit has been dropped, but he is seeking compensationfor the $600,000 he says he spent on his defense.   &quot;Slapp suits are becoming an organized and promotedstrategy,&quot; Mr. Nader said. &quot;They're gaining momentum. Butonce firms {contemplating a Slapp suit} realize that they'rein for a countersuit, they'll think twice.&quot;   ---   CREDITORS WIN key fraudulent-conveyance ruling involvingReginald Lewis.   In an important decision for creditors, a federal judgeruled that New York state's fraudulent-conveyance law appliesin leveraged buy-outs that allegedly leave a companyinsolvent.   Companies created in leveraged deals and left with largeamounts of debt as a result have turned to such lawsnationally to seek to recover money from lenders and sellerswho benefited from the transactions. Underfraudulent-conveyance laws, a transaction can be consideredfraudulent if the deal leaves a company unable to pay itsdebt or without enough capital to conduct its business.   Judge Morris Lasker, in federal court in Manhattan, alsoruled that in deciding whether a lender can be sued under thefraudulent-conveyance law, the financing and other parts ofthe transaction must be viewed as &quot;one integratedtransaction.&quot; That decision is expected to make it easier tobring in as defendants banks and brokerage firms that financea buy-out. Other courts have ruled that if the financingportion of the transaction was structured properly, thelender couldn't be sued.   The decision, in a case involving the sale of investorReginald Lewis's McCall Pattern Co. in 1987, is likely toboost the controversial use of fraudulent-conveyance laws insuch transactions. Judge Lasker also ruled that Mr. Lewis canbe sued for the return of his proceeds of $52 million fromthe buy-out. Judge Lasker's ruling only addressed whether thelawsuit can proceed. He didn't rule on the merits of theallegations, which are denied by Mr. Lewis and the lenders inthe transaction.   Courts have been divided over whether the laws apply tocomplex business transactions such as leveraged buy-outs,which are financed largely with debt. Judge Lasker, however,said in his decision: &quot;A leveraged buy-out . . . such as theone at issue here can harm creditors in exactly the wayfraudulent conveyance laws are designed to prevent.&quot;   Judge Lasker also ruled that Bankers Trust Co., whichprovided $15 million in financing, can be sued under thefraudulent-conveyance law. &quot;A lender is required to make areasonable determination that the buy-out is consistent withthe rights of creditors before advancing funds,&quot; the judgesaid   Robert W. Gottlieb, an attorney with the firm Rosenman andamp;Colin representing plaintiffs in the lawsuit, said: &quot;TheLasker decision continues the trend in the law that banks andbrokerage firms that finance leveraged buy-outs can be heldliable if the target {company} is left with unreasonablysmall capital.&quot;   Mark H. Alcott, an attorney for Mr. Lewis at the firmPaul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton andamp; Garrision, said: &quot;Mr. Lewisleft the company in excellent condition. . . . Plaintiffsalways target a deep pocket, and that's what they have donehere.&quot;   Mr. Alcott said subsequent owners of Crowthers McCallPattern Inc., as the company is now known, were to blame forthe company's financial woes. A year-and-a-half after thesale, the company missed a loan payment and filed forbankruptcy-law protection. Mr. Lewis is being sued by aliquidating trust set up in the bankruptcy proceedings.   Mr. Alcott and a spokesman for Mr. Lewis also noted thatthe sale wasn't a typical leveraged buy-out, as only abouthalf of the $63 million paid for the company was financedwith debt, and the company wasn't taken over by management.   Mr. Lewis said the company &quot;was sound when I bought it in1984, improved significantly from 1984 to 1987 while I wasthe principal owner of it, and even after I sold it continuedto generate significant operating income. The utter waste ofits resources by others after I sold it cannot under anystretch of imagination be laid at my door.&quot;   Crowthers McCall said in its lawsuit that high interestpayments stemming from the buy-out, rather thanmismanagement, caused its financial problems. The company haschanged hands again since Mr. Lewis sold it.   ---   DELAWARE COURT doesn't have jurisdiction in IBM caseagainst Comdisco.   International Business Machines Corp. can't get aninjunction to stop a competitor from altering and re-leasingits computer equipment, a Delaware court ruled.   The Delaware Chancery Court said in a July 2 decision thatit doesn't have jurisdiction over a high-profile lawsuitfiled in January by IBM and its credit subsidiary againstComdisco Inc., the firm's biggest competitor in thecomputer-leasing market.   Without ruling on the case's merits, the court refused toconsider an injunction to stop certain of Comdisco's businesspractices. But the court noted that IBM might be entitled todamages if it could prove liability in a court of law, and itgave IBM 20 days to transfer the suit to Delaware SuperiorCourt, which it said was the appropriate forum for thedispute.   A chancery court generally deals with matters requiringjudicial intervention -- usually in the form of injunctions-- to reach a fair result, while a common-law court dealswith liability and damages. In most states the two types ofcourt have been merged, but they remain separate in Delaware.   IBM, based in Armonk, N.Y., said that it planned tocontinue its case against Comdisco but that it hadn't decidedwhich avenue to take. A spokesman said the company mighttransfer the case, appeal the ruling, or file suit in adifferent state.   The IBM suit alleged that Comdisco sells parts ofmainframe computers owned by IBM's credit unit. IBM alsoalleged that Comdisco takes parts out of machines leased fromIBM Credit, puts them into other machines and leases thosemachines to customers. And IBM said Comdisco has sometimestaken an entire machine that a customer leased from IBMCredit and released it to another customer.   Comdisco hasn't denied IBM's specific charges, but hascriticized IBM for &quot;grossly and unfairly&quot; mischaracterizingits practices. The company, based in Rosemont, Ill., deniesdoing anything illegal, or damaging IBM in any way. AComdisco spokesman praised the court's decision and predictedIBM would have a hard time proving damage if the case were toland in Superior Court.   ---   LISA JONES, former Drexel assistant, barred fromsecurities industry.   Ms. Jones, who was convicted of perjury in 1989, settledthe Securities and Exchange Commission action and agreed tothe bar without admitting or denying wrongdoing.   She had worked as an assistant to former Drexel BurnhamLambert Inc. trader Bruce Lee Newberg, who worked directlyfor junk-bond mogul Michael Milken. Mr. Newberg was convictedof securities fraud.   Ms. Jones, a former runaway who became a $100,000-a-yearDrexel employee, was convicted by a jury in 1989 of fivecounts of perjury and two counts of obstruction of justicefor lying to a grand jury looking into allegedly illegaltrading involving Drexel. She was sentenced to 18 months inprison and fined $50,000 by a federal judge in that case. Ms.Jones was 26 years old at the time.   Her conviction was affirmed on appeal, but the sentencewas reduced to 10 months, which she served before her releaseearlier this year. Her lawyer, Daniel Bookin, called theSEC's action &quot;completely unnecessary given all the facts. Shehas no present intention of going near the securitiesindustry.&quot; But he added that it &quot;was not worth the emotionalprice of litigating this when the SEC made it clear thatnothing we could do would change their minds.&quot;</LP><TEXT/></DOC>
