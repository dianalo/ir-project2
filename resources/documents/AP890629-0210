IRNA quoted local press reports as saying the documents of all 35were judged incomplete Wednesday. Registration ends July 2.Elections are July 28.   The report, monitored in Cyprus, named none of the hopefuls,saying it was illegal until the Council of Guardians approves theirqualifications.   IRNA said a prominent deputy from the Majlis, or parliament, wasthe only face recognized by reporters.   Others included a retired judge, a psychology student and ashopkeeper.   Interior Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi told a news conferencemost of the aspirants were under 35 years old. He said the turnout``shows public interest in the presidential election and the freedomin the present Iranian society,'' IRNA reported.   Mohtashemi said special security committees will be set upthroughout Iran to stop any action by ``counterrevolutionarygroups'' during voting.   ``I had a chat with friends and I decided that I must become apresidential candidate,'' one hopeful was quoted as telling thedaily Kayhan. ``Of course I know that (Parliament speaker) HashemiRafsanjani can be the most credible and prominent candidate in thiselection but I thought my presence could add heat to the campaign.''   Rafsanjani announced his candidacy at a news conference rightafter Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini died on June 3 and remains theonly leading political figure in the race.   He is widely expected to win, and would have to give up hisparliamentary seat. Mohtashemi said by-elections will be held threemonths after the presidential election.   Under a new constitution to be voted on in a referendum July 28,the presidency will be much stronger. The already powerfulRafsanjani is expected to take over day-to-day running of Iran.   The Council of Guardians, a committee of 12 religious and legalexperts who review all laws passed by parliament, must approve eachpresidential candidate.   The Interior Ministry said a presidential candidate must haveIranian citizenship and ancestry; a background in religion andpolitics; management and administrative experience, and must be abelieving, honest and pious Moslem.   IRNA earlier quoted the Farsi-language daily Abrar as saying theFreedom Movement of Mehdi Bazargan, the only opposition figureallowed to stay in Iran, has not yet decided whether to nominate acandidate.   Bazargan, 81, was the first prime minister after the Islamicrevolution came to power in February 1979. Khomeini fired him eightmonths later, however, saying his attitides were too liberal.   The government-run, Persian-language daily Jomhuri Islami saidThursday that the speed with which Iran was electing a new presidentand writing a new constitution after Khomeini's death was proof ofIran's stability.   Outside analysts have said the speedy elections could indicate anattempt by Rafsanjani and Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the currentpresident and Khomeini's elected successor, to consolidate theircontrol over the government.   The are considered pragmatists, desiring a greater role for theprivate sector in the economy and outside financing for Iran'sreconstruction after the 8-year war with Iraq. The more radicalcamp, including Mohtashemi, support a centralized economy and opposeties with the West.   Jomhuri Islami's editorial mocked analysts who it said werewaiting for Iran to plunge into turmoil after Khomeini's death.   It said developments since the revolutionary patriarch died``disappointed them even more than any other development since theestablishment of the Islamic Republic.''   Khamenei said Thursday that Iran's hostility toward Washingtonwould abate only if the United States stopped backing Iraniananti-revolutionaries, Tehran radio reported.   The broadcast, monitored in Nicosia, quoted Khamenei as sayingthat ``the big powers such as America must repent from supportingthe anti-revolutionaries, and until that happens the rage of theIranian nation against America will not abate.''</TEXT></DOC>
