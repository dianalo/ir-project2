In New York, meanwhile, two unions representing 100,000 actorsset a March 21 deadline for a strike against makers of TV and radiocommercials.   Talks between the Alliance of Motion Picture and TelevisionProducers and the striking Writers Guild of America had gone onhere under the auspices of a federal mediator.   Marty Waldman, a guild spokesman, said the producers broke offthe talks.   A spokesman for the producers, Herb Steinberg, said thescriptwriters' demands are so unrealistic that ``further talkswould be fruitless. ... They're not even in the same neighborhoodin an assessment of the economics involved.''   No new negotiations were set. The 9,000 scriptwriters walked outSunday over creative control and royalties from reruns.   ``In view of the seriousness of the strike and its impact on theindustry, we had hoped that continued talks might bring us betterresults,'' said Mona Mangan, executive director of the WritersGuild of America-East.   ``We deeply regret that the companies do not view these talks asmoving us closer together,'' she said.   The strike, in its fourth day Thursday, has not yet had awidespread effect on the movie and TV industry, but has delayed thedebut of at least two series and has forced the David Letterman andJohnny Carson shows into reruns.   It could shorten the TV season if producers failed to stockenough scripts or discovered the need for extensive rewriting.   In New York, leaders of the Screen Actors Guild and the AmericanFederation of Television and Radio Artists announced a March 21deadline for a strike against the American Association ofAdvertising Agencies and the Association of National Advertisers.   Union members voted 93 percent to 7 percent March 2 to authorizea walkout, according to a statement from the unions. The laststrike of its kind lasted seven weeks in 1978-79.   The current contract expired Feb. 6 but was extended whilenegotiations continued over such key issues as the industry'sinsistence on removing cost-of-living increases, and the union'sdemand for higher compensation for commercials shown on cabletelevision, the union said.   There was no answer Thursday night at the New York offices ofthe American Association of Advertising Agencies. The unionsnegotiate in the field of TV commercials. Radio commercials areunder AFTRA's jurisdiction.   In a strike, SAG and AFTRA members would be asked not to performor audition for commerciials, and to terminate the producers' rightto use any commercial beyond its maximum period of use, the unionssaid.   Some of the most popular shows were near the end of their workschedules when the scriptwriters went on strike. The episodeclosing out the popular eight-year run of ``Magnum P.I.'' has beenwritten.   ``I have a lot of projects that are jeopardized now,'' saidexecutive producer Jennifer Alward. ``There are options on booksthat will run out if the scripts aren't delivered on time. If thestrike goes three months, what do I do?''   Wes Kenney, executive producer of the ABC soap opera ``GeneralHospital'' said: ``I have enough scripts to last me through anystrike.''   Writers working on the Academy Awards ceremonies slated forworldwide broadcast April 11 said they left its script half writtenwhen they walked out. But producer Samuel Goldwyn Jr. said: ``Theshow must go on, and it will.''</TEXT></DOC>
