DorfmanStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 10/22/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> PUBLISHING (PUB)STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR) </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The stock market debacle seemed to many investors to come out of nowhere. But subscribers to a little-known newsletter published by Francis Xavier Curzio had a blunt warning.    &quot;CRASH?&quot; was the headline in the October issue mailed to subscribers in late September.    Despite the question mark, Mr. Curzio made his point in no uncertain terms. &quot;Three crashes occurred in October: 1929, 1978, and 1979. This month's crash could be worse than the prior three crashes combined,&quot; he wrote.    While specifying October as the most likely month for a crash, Mr. Curzio allowed for the possibility of a delayed onset. But he firmly predicted that the Dow Jones Industrial Average would decline to &quot;around 1700&quot; by April 1988.    Mr. Curzio publishes his letter from a small office in a Queens neighborhood, almost an hour by subway from the skyscrapers of Wall Street. The letter, the F.X.C. Investors Corp. Update, has only 1,500 or so regular subscribers -- many of whom pay $190 a year -- and an additional 500 or so who are receiving it on a trial basis.    While Mr. Curzio isn't the only newsletter writer to give his subscribers some timely warning, his admonitions were unusually blunt and clear. Several other letter writers have made less-direct statements that might have led readers to pull their funds out of the market before Monday's crash    Mark Hulbert, whose Hulbert Financial Digest tracks theperformance of almost 100 investment newsletters, singles outfive others that he says did a good job of warning readersout of the market in time -- in some cases, in the nick oftime. The five were Telephone Switch Newsletter, StockmarketCycles, the Zweig Forecast, Investech Market Letter and DowTheory Letters. Mr. Hulbert, who says he selects newslettersto track on the basis of requests from his own subscribers,doesn't follow Mr. Curzio's.   Mr. Curzio says he has never before, in about 15 years of newsletter publishing, predicted a crash -- &quot;and I hope I never have to again.&quot; He began urging investors to take profits in his September issue, but soon turned much more bearish.    His sentiment was heavily influenced by the &quot;Bork boondoggle,&quot; Mr. Curzio says, referring to the heated debate over the nomination of Robert Bork to the Supreme Court. To him, it was a sign that &quot;President Reagan has lost control&quot; of the legislative process, and to some extent of the government.    A second crucial event, Mr. Curzio says, was a recent upturn in interest rates: He turned bearish as they crossed 9.5%. The third major factor was weak auto sales in September. He watches car sales closely. Another factor was the deficit, which he thinks could &quot;explode&quot; to more than $300 billion if the country tumbles into a recession -- which he believes is nearly certain.    As a result, he contends that most stocks are still overvalued. &quot;Only about 15% of stocks are undervalued now,&quot; he says. &quot;About 60% are still overvalued, and the other 25% I don't know.    A powerfully built man who keeps a pack of cigarettes in his shirt pocket, the 42-year-old Mr. Curzio worked as a messenger on Wall Street when he was a boy. Attending classes at night, he earned a degree in accounting from New York City Community College. Before starting his newsletter in 1972, Mr. Curzio says, he was an accounting supervisor for Lone Star Industries Inc.    In his spare time, he likes to fish for fluke, flounder and bluefish off the coast of eastern Long Island. But he says, &quot;My real hobby is reading everything I can get my hands on about the market.&quot;    The surge in stock prices yesterday, Mr. Curzio suggests, was &quot;a camouflage upturn,&quot; spurred in part by corporate stock buy-backs that he believes don't make economic sense. He thinks more turbulence lies ahead, as nervous consumers cut back on big-ticket purchases.    For the time being, he thinks small investors should neither sell nor buy stocks. &quot;There are panics up and panics down,&quot; he says. &quot;How can you apply any kind of logic to a stock that fluctuates as much in a day as it normally does in a year?&quot;    He recommends buying high-quality corporate bonds, which provide a good interest coupon, plus a chance for capital gains if interest rates drop. But he warns: &quot;Don't go near junk bonds. There will be some bankruptcies&quot; during the next recession. </TEXT></DOC>
