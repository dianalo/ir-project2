STEICHEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   About 4,000 workers went on strike Tuesdayat a coal mine in southern Poland and demanded the legalization ofthe banned Solidarity trade union, activists said.   The occupation strike came on the eighth anniversary of thebirth of the outlawed trade union federation in the port city ofGdansk.   Witnesses said about 600 police took up positions around theManifest Lipcowy mine near the city of Jastrzebie. A Solidarityadviser said there were no reports of violence and police made noattempt to move into the facility.   The security forces, which were called in by mine management,cordoned off the mine, and public transportation to the facilitywas suspended, said the Solidarity adviser, Jacek Kuron.   The mine's management informed strikers over loudspeakers thatit considered the strike illegal, then declared the mine closeduntil further notice, he said.   Mine director Karol Grzywa ordered ``anyone not directly engagedin works toward securing the mine's property to leave thepremises,'' the state-run PAP news agency said.   As of Tuesday night, 700 workers still were in the mine, thenews agency said.   ``The strike is clearly political in nature,'' PAP said, addingthat wage demands were not high on the miners' agenda.   Legalizaton of the Solidarity union is among the chief demandsmade by the miners, said Solidarity spokeswoman KatarzynaKetrzynska.   The workers also want mine management to reinstate workers firedfor independent trade union activities, she said, adding that theworkers also are demanding better working conditions and payincreases.   The action began when the overnight shift refused to take uptheir tools. They were joined by workers arriving for the morningshift, Kuron said.   Kuron said mine management then locked out members of theafternoon shift to prevent them from joining the strike.   Solidarity spokesmen said workers at the nearby Borynia minestaged a brief sympathy rally, but went back to work at noon.   Jastrzebie is located about 280 miles southwest of Warsaw in theheart of Silesia, Poland's most vital industrial and mining region.   Security officials, meanwhile, briefly detained 10 Solidarityleaders at the Rudna copper mine near the city of Wroclaw in lowerSilesia. That mine also has been the scene of unrest in recentmonths, with workers demanding improved safety conditions.   Jan Sugalski, a Solidarity activist in the region, said twocrews were taken to the mine's management building for ``safetytraining.'' There was no production at the mine Tuesday, he said.   Workers at the Rudna mine staged a protest rally on Monday.   Most of Poland's heavy industry is located in the Silesianregion. Its coal and copper mines supply raw materials for thenation's vital steel and shipbuilding industries.   On Aug. 16, 1980, workers at factories around Gdansk joinedstriking shipyard workers and jointly declared their demands forthe formation of an independent trade union federation.   The Solidarity trade union federation was suppressed in 1981when the government imposed martial law. It was banned a year laterby parliament.</TEXT></DOC>
