Xu Wenli wrote his daughter inone of five letters obtained by The Associated Press on Tuesday.   In another, he wrote gleefully: ``I had a great weekend because Igot six letters.''   Xu's letters, dated since April and sent to his family in Beijingfrom Beijing's No. 1 Prison, are his only contact with the outsidesince he was barred from having visitors in 1985, four years into a15-year sentence for counterrevolutionary activity.   Xu, 43, has spent much of the time in solitary confinement.   The former electrician was among the leaders of China's 1978-79Democracy Wall Movement, during which Deng Xiaoping, newly in power,tolerated unprecedented open calls for multiparty democracy andother reforms.   But in early 1979, his position in the ruling Communist Partyconsolidated, Deng ordered a crackdown on the dozens of unofficialjournals that had sprung up, and he ended the Democracy Wall itself,a brick wall in Beijing where outspoken posters went up daily.   Xu mimeographed the underground magazine April Fifth Forum in hishome, in which he argued that a multiparty system was notanti-Marxist and would help the socialist cause. He was arrested in1981 and convicted the following year.   His letters, addressed to his wife Qang Tong and 16-year-olddaughter, Xu Jingjing, said nothing about his own condition.Instead, he sent a steady stream of questions and advice.   To the daughter, who has been ill for several years with a badback, he wrote on Oct. 28: ``You should improve your dailynutrition, exercise daily and make a study plan. After you make yourplans tell me or I will worry.   ``Did you have a happy birthday? No matter how tired, how busyyou are, try to squeeze time to sing, listen to music, playbadminton, and then you will be happier and the back pain will beless. ... When you're recovered you'll be jumping around like arabbit.''   To his wife, a teacher, he wrote, ``Your school is too far away.Try not to bicycle if possible. ... When you go home after school,is there anyone to accompany you?''   He closed, ``I'm kissing you, my dear.''   In the most recent letter, dated Dec. 2, Xu wrote, ``Regardingyour letter of Nov. 12, never mind the contents. The mere fact thatit's already four pages causes tears of happiness to cover my face.''   He also wrote of his pride in his wife and daughter, adding,``Because of you, and for you, I can be at peace and accept whatfate sends.''   Xu also expressed concern for his family in a ``self-defense''smuggled from prison in 1985. Publication of the essay in Westernperiodicals caused authorities to cancel his visitor privileges.   Ren Wanding, a fellow participant in the Democracy Wall movementwho was jailed for four years, said Xu was allowed to send atwo-page letter about once every two months.   Ren, who was released in 1983, remained silent until November,when he gave foreign reporters a long essay on the Democracy WallMovement, also called the ``Beijing Spring.''   In a new essay released Tuesday, Ren declared the 12 monthsbeginning in November ``Beijing Spring Memorial Year'' and said hisgoal was to draw international attention to the plight of his jailedfriends.   More than a dozen leaders of the movement remain jailed. The mostfamous is Wei Jingsheng, who pleaded for democracy as a ``fifthmodernization'' to go along with the government's program ofimproving agriculture, industry, science and the military.   Although the Communist Party has encouraged greater openness onselected topics, including disclosure of official corruption, callsfor any change in the party's ruling role remain forbidden.   Sporadic calls by students for democracy have been suppressed,including a series of massive nationwide demonstrations in thewinter of 1986-87.   In his latest essay, Ren appealed to President-elect George Bush,who served as U.S. liaison officer to China in 1974-75.   ``If you are really concerned about Chinese affairs, then I askyou to first of all be concerned about the Dzmoracy Wall personageswho benefited China's social development and opening up. They havebeen discriminated against and watched by your friendly Chinesegovernment,'' Ren wrote.   Aside from Ren, China's only dissident willing to be quoted asdemanding multiparty democracy is internationally knownastrophysicist Fang Lizhi, who believes his fame has shielded him.   Ren, a little-known accountant, said he was not so confident butthat he hoped publicity would be a shield.   ``I don't want China to copy Western systems or Westerndemocracy,'' he said in an interview. ``China can work out its owndemocracy. China's economic liberalization inevitably must lead togreater political freedom.''</TEXT></DOC>
