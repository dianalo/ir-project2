Mitchell also said Sunday that, ``Ultimately, the hosage crisiswill not be solved until the Lebanon crisis is solved.''   The Maine Democrat, interviewed on ABC's ``This Week with DavidBrinkley,'' called for pressuring Syria to stop letting terroristsoperate with impunity in Lebanon.   The White House offered no comment Sunday on the reported offerby captors of American Joseph Cicippio to free him in exchange fora Shiite Moslem cleric and several hundred Shiite and Palestinianprisoners held by the Israelis.   Bill Harlow, a White House spokesman, said, ``We wouldn'tcomment on it in any way ... We try not to react to each individualrumor or report. It's a very fluid situation and that doesn't doany good.''   ``The diplomatic efforts continue,'' said Harlow.   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, in Mexico City for aconference of U.S. and Mexican Cabinet members, was asked about thedemands for Cicippio's release and said, ``our well-establishedpolicy is not to negotiate with terrorists.   ``If the United States were to get into that game, we'd simplysee a lot more Americans taken hostage around the world,'' Bakersaid.   Mitchell said that with the death of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeiniand the election of Hashemi Rafsanjani as Iran's new president,``there is a movement within Iran away from Islamic fanaticism andmore an attempt toward moderation.''   ``That's a welcome development from our standpoint,'' Mitchellsaid. But it may also reduce ``their direct control over thesegroups ... No one can say for sure that each and every order byRafsanjani will be followed precisely by the Hezbollah.''   Moshe Arens, the foreign minister of Israel, predicted on ABCthat if Israel and United States keep talking and acting tough toterrorists and the states that back them, ``we may not see manymore abductions in the Middle East.''   Hussein Mousawi, a leader of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, toldreporters Sunday in Lebanon that his group may kill an Israeliprisoner unless Israel returns Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid.   Israel has offered to swap Obeid and 150 Shiite prisoners forall Western hostages and three Israeli soldiers held in Lebanon.Israeli commandos abducted Obeid on July 28; three days later agroup called the Organization for the Oppressed on Earth claimed tohave executed Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins in revenge.   Arens said Obeid was ``of some importance amongst those band ofcriminals ... We seem to be holding an important card which maymake it possible ... to release all of the hostages.'' But hecautioned against expecting an early release.   Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's defense minister, said on CBS' ``Facethe Nation'' that ``we will not separate anything'' in the proposedexchange of hostages, but the Israeli soldiers are ``our firstpriority.''   Rabin said he felt more responsibility for his three capturedsoldiers than Cicippio, ``an American that converted to Islam anddecided to stay in Lebanon.''   Sen. William S. Cohen, R-Maine, a key member of the SenateIntelligence Committee, said on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' that Bushwas ``doing the correct thing ... pursuing every conceivablediplomatic initiative.''   However, Cohen said, ``Patience in the face of prolongedsavagery really is not patience at all, but it's a policy ofappeasement.'' He urged the West to form a united front againststates that back the terrorists.   Former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said on ABC that,``We have to devalue the hostages'' and convince the terrorists``that the United States will not let itself get jerked aroundevery year or every six months by threats of murder.''</TEXT></DOC>
