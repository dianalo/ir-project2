Sease and David Wilson </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> STK NDX </IN><TEXT>   A last minute mini-rally pushed stock prices slightly higher yesterday after the Dow Jones Industrial Average spent most of the day in negative territory.    The industrial average closed at 2075.21, up 3.91. Advancing issues outpaced decliners on the New York Stock Exchange 854-641.    Volume on the Big Board was light, with 152.5 million shares changing hands, down from 189.6 million Friday. Yesterday's volume included nearly 16 million shares of dividend-related trading in Allegheny Power. The stock lost 1/8 to close at 39 7/8.    Traders and money managers were heartened that stock prices didn't retreat yesterday after posting a record 114-point gain last week. Although profit taking held prices mostly lower through the day, the late gain suggested to some analysts that prices will be headed sharply higher in the next few days.    &quot;If they can't knock them down, they'll take them higher,&quot; said John Brooks, managing director of Marshall andamp; Co. in Atlanta. &quot;Basically there's still some positive feeling emerging concerning interest rates. The market is saying rates aren't going higher, and if that's true there's way, way too much cash on the sidelines.&quot;    Andrew Riley, a market strategist at Yamaichi International, said he figures that yesterday's action suggests the current rally has at least a couple of weeks left in it.    &quot;I was pretty impressed with the market's behavior, given that it was a Monday after a strong week,&quot; he said. Like Mr. Brooks, he believes that the Dow Jones Industrial Average has a good chance of surpassing its post-crash high of 2110.08.    The swiftness of the market's surge last week caught many investors flat-footed. Gail Dudack, a technical analyst at S.G. Warburg Securities, said that stocks are likely to continue to rally from current levels as those investors move into the market. &quot;I don't think we'll go below 2000 again before we get to 2300&quot; on the Dow Jones industrials, she said.    &quot;What you're looking at here is the possibility that the market's not going to let anybody back in&quot; who stayed on the sidelines during last week's rally in anticipation that prices would drop, said Tom Gallagher, managing director in charge of capital commitment at Oppenheimer andamp; Co.    &quot;It seems like there's money ready to come into the marketplace and waiting for a sizable correction, and it's starting to look like that's just not going to happen,&quot; Mr. Gallagher said.    David Dreman, managing director at Dreman Value Management, said that he also thinks that stocks will extend their latest advance, but he noted that investor psychology remains somewhat fragile.    &quot;Basically you have good values, but you also have a very, very skittish market,&quot; he said. &quot;It's a market that will turn on a dime on any bad news and go back down, and with good news will move up some.&quot;    The net result will be &quot;a very grueling market&quot; that will gradually work its way higher over time, instead of surging as it did last week, he said. &quot;Anybody who looks for a big breakthrough on the upside or a big drop on the downside is doing some pretty wishful thinking. We've got a market that's going to trade in a pretty narrow range.&quot;    Even so, Mr. Dreman said, his firm's equity portfolio has been fully invested for the past few weeks. &quot;With this kind of market, where there's a lot of value, it's more dangerous to be out of the market than it is to be in it,&quot; he said.    Philip Morris slid 2 1/8 to 84 5/8. Rep. Mike Andrews (D., Texas) introduced a bill to raise the federal cigarette tax by 25 cents a pack and use a portion of the revenue for an anti-smoking campaign directed at teen-agers. The news, along with the imminent conclusion of a widely watched cigarette liability case in New Jersey, hurt other tobacco stocks as well. RJR Nabisco eased 3/4 to 48 1/2, and American Brands fell 5/8 to 45 1/2.    NCR surged 3 3/8 to 64 3/8 amid renewed rumors of a takeover offer from Unisys, according to Dow Jones Professional Investor Report. Officials at NCR and Unisys couldn't immediately be reached for comment. Other technology issues were also strong, as Digital Equipment climbed 2 3/8 to 108 1/8, Cray Research jumped 2 1/4 to 81, Compaq Computer went up 1 1/2 to 55 1/2, Texas Instruments rose 1 1/8 to 46 1/4, and Motorola gained 1 1/4 to 49 3/4.    Texaco rose 7/8 to 50 7/8. As expected, the company agreed to sell its West German unit to Rheinisch-Westfaelisches Elektrizitaetswerk. The $1.23 billion sale, which has to be approved by the West German government, is the first step in Texaco's $5 billion restructuring.    Macmillan, which said that it would consider a sweetened takeover offer from Robert M. Bass Group this week, jumped 3 1/2 to 75. The Bass Group raised its bid to $73 a share from $64 and offered to restructure the company on more favorable terms than Macmillan proposed last week.    Morton Thiokol fell 1 1/8 to 39 7/8. The company, which is involved in the redesign of the advanced solid rocket motor for the space shuttle, said that it won't participate in bidding to provide the actual motors.    Avon Products, which will reduce its annual dividend to $1 a common share from $2 and sell its Foster Home Healthcare division for $225 million, dropped 1/2 to 23 3/8. The sale of the unit will result in an additional after-tax loss of $95 million beyond a $30 million reserve established last year.    Ford Motor rose 1 1/4 to 50 1/2. Kidder Peabody raised its investment rating on the stock to &quot;attractive&quot; from &quot;neutral&quot; and said that the company is likely to raise its annual dividend to $3.20 a share from $2.40 by June 1989, the investor report said.    Valero Energy fell 7/8 to 7 3/4. Clayton M. Williams Jr., a Texas oilman, is seeking a total of $786 million in actual and punitive damages from the company in a lawsuit that alleges that Valero violated a natural gas supply contract.    The American Stock Exchange index gained 1.06 to 301.94. Amex volume was 8,610,000 shares, compared with 9,860,000 Friday. There were 325 issues advancing, 242 declining and 280 unchanged. </TEXT></DOC>
