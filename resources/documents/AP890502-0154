The group said a study done for it by John Large and Associates,a nuclear engineering consulting firm in London, concluded that thesubmarine may release up to 20 million curies of radioactivity ifthe vessel is not recovered.   That is equal to about one-third of the radiation released bythe April 1986 explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant inthe Soviet Ukraine, Greenpeace said. Thirty-one people died in theChernobyl accident.   The Soviet submarine caught fire and sank in 5,000 feet of wateroff northern Norway. Soviet officials said 42 of the 69 sailors onboard were killed.   Moscow said earlier this month that a decision on whether toattempt to raise the sub will not be made for several months. Itsaid the vessel's two nuclear reactors were shut down before thecrew evacuated and that there was no danger of radiation leaks. ButGreenpeace took issue with that assertion.   ``Even if the reactor containment structures weren't damaged bythe fire, the collision with the ocean floor or the deep waterpressure, the protective structure will erode before the reactorsare safe,'' said Steve Shallhorn, a Greenpeace representative.</TEXT></DOC>
