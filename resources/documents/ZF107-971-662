is normally set closer togetherthan the pair &quot;Am&quot; to preserve even letter spacing.andP;  The act of tucking the&quot;a&quot; closer to the &quot;T&quot; is called kerning.andP;  Most Macintosh page-layoutapplications can kern problem pairs, but only on a case-by-case basis.andP;  Youcan't just tighten the &quot;Ta&quot; pair and have that kerning value automaticallyapplied to all other instances of the pair.andM;Traditional typesetting systems use kerning tables -- lists of characterpairs that are kerned automatically -- so that manual kerning is requiredonly for fine-tuning.andP;  Most Macintosh fonts contain kerning tables, and mostpage-layout applications recognize and use them, but until recently there wasno easy method for adding new pairs or altering the existing ones.andM;We looked at five recently released kerning utilities.andP;  All perform the samebasic task, editing the kerning tables built into the FOND resource of aMacintosh font.andP;  All are capable of a precision of one one-thousandth of anem space.andP;  Their differences are mainly in the extra features they offer,their user interfaces and pricing.andM;LetrTuck Plus.andP;  LetrTuck Plus by EDCO Services Inc. of Tampa, Fla., is ano-frills kerning editor.andP;  It opens the fonts installed in the System file orin font suitcase files.andP;  After opening the desired font suitcase and choosingthe specific font and style you want to edit, the kerning pairs for that fontand style appear in an Overview window.andM;To adjust a pair, you highlight it in the Overview window.andP;  That pair thenappears in the Editor window.andP;  You can adjust the kerning value by using ascroll bar or by typing a kerning value into a text box.andP;  You add and deletepairs using menu commands.andM;You can test your kerning pairs by printing a test sheet to a Post-Scriptprinter.andP;  The Print command prints the selected pair and all other pairs inthe font with the same first character, at five sizes ranging from 12 pointsto 72 points.andM;You can save the new kerning values to the font or to a LetrTuck kerningtable that you can load into other fonts.andP;  When you load a table into a font,you can append the new table to the existing pairs or overwrite them.andP;  Youcan also save and load QuarkXPress kerning data files or save the kerningtable as a text file.andM;LetrTuck suffers from annoying limitations.andP;  It was deliberately designed tonot run under MultiFinder, thereby avoiding problems caused by modifying afont that is in use by another application.andP;  A more serious limitation isthat if you use Suitcase II or MasterJuggler, LetrTuck refuses to run untilyou close all fonts that were opened with these utilities.andP;  The manual isinadequate.andP;  Half of it is devoted to the IBM PC version, while the otherhalf refers to a previous release of the Macintosh product.andP;  A Read Me fileon the disk contains details of the differences between old and new versions,but it is not a satisfactory substitute for a manual.andM;LetrTuck includes a set of kerning tables for the fonts built into theLaserWriter Plus.andM;MacKern.andP;  Wheeling, Ill.-based ICOM Simulations' MacKern works with bothMultiFinder and Suitcase.andP;  It won't allow you to modify a font that isalready open, but you can open any un-used font suitcase file.andP;  MacKern letsyou open multiple fonts at the same time, each of which appears in its ownEditor and Overview windows.andM;The Editor window displays the current pair at 100-point size, with ascrolling list of all the kerning pairs and values in the font.andP;  You adjustthe kerning by using the scroll bar or by entering a numeric value.andM;The Overview window shows all the kerning pairs and values in the currentfont in tabular form at the point size you choose.andP;  Double-clicking a pairopens the Editor window with that pair selected.andM;The Sample window displays any text file up to 32 Kbytes in the size chosenfor the Overview window.andP;  Printing from the Sample window prints the sampletext in the current font and size.andP;  Printing from the Overview window printsall the kerning pairs, and printing from the Editor window prints a list ofthe selected pair or pairs.andM;You can select multiple pairs in either the Editor or the Overview window,cut or copy them to the Clipboard, and paste them into a different font.andP;  Twoother commands work on multiple pairs: Set Selected Pairs lets you apply akerning value to all selected pairs, while Adjust Selected Pairs lets youoffset the kerning value of all the selected pairs by a specified amount.andM;You can save kerning values to the font file, a MacKern data file, a textfile or to an existing Adobe Font Metrics (AFM) file.andP;  Only PC applicationsuse the kerning information in AFM files, so the ability to alter them ismainly valuable in multiplatform environments.andP;  When you load a table into afont, you can replace the old table entirely; merge old and new, givingpreference to the old pairs or the new pairs; or have MacKern prompt you fora decision on each duplicate pair.andM;MacKern can convert FONT resources to the newer NFNTs, which allow a muchgreater range of ID numbers, and change a font's ID to avoid conflicts.andP;  Thisfeature is dangerous in inexperienced hands.andP;  The question of changing fontIDs is glossed over in the otherwise excellent documentation, which containsa tutorial, a reference section and a comprehensive troubleshooting guide.andP;  Agood on-screen help system contains page references to the manual.andM;MacKern includes two generic kerning tables containing pairs without kerningvalues, one with 523 entries and another with 265, that you can load into anyfont instead of entering kerning pairs by hand.andM;Kern-Rite.andP;  Kern-Rite from The Software Shop Inc. of Bellmore, N.Y., looksand feels like a scaled-down version of MacKern that opens only one font at atime.andM;Kern-Rite uses Overview and Editor windows that function more or lessidentically to their counterparts in MacKern, but it lacks a Sample window.andO;Printing options are limited to using the Print command, which prints all thekerning pairs in the table at the size selected in the Overview window, orthe Print Sample command, which prints the selected pair or pairs in sizesranging from 9 points to 100 points.andM;The Overview window displays all the pairs at the size you choose, and theirassociated kerning values.andP;  Double-clicking a pair in the Overview windowcalls up the Editor window with that pair selected.andM;Instead of a scroll bar, Kern-Rite's Editor window uses a small triangularhandle that you drag for coarse adjustment, and left and right arrows forfiner adjustment.andP;  Or, you can enter a numeric value in points, picas,inches, millimeters or ems.andP;  The Editor window also contains a text box intowhich you can type new pairs directly.andP;  Kern-Rite lets you select multiplepairs for cutting or copying, but it has no facility for setting or adjustingthose pairs as Mac-Kern does.andM;You can save the new kerning values to the font file or to a Kern-Rite datafile.andP;  When you do so, you have the option of updating the associated AFMfile.andP;  Kern-Rite does not read data directly from AFM files, but a separateutility, The File Buckle, converts kerning values from AFM files intoKern-Rite data file format.andP;  Kern-Rite offers the same table-merging optionsas MacKern.andM;Kern-Rite also lets you change the font ID and convert FONT resources toNFNTs.andP;  Again, this subject is not adequately covered in the manual, which isa rather skimpy 24-page affair.andP;  A Read Me file on the progrThe Kern-Ritepackage includes the Font Info DA, which shows font IDs and identifiesconflicts.andM;Kerningware.andP;  Kerningware Editor from Kerningware of Toronto takes quite adifferent approach to defining kerning tables.andP;  The company's main product iskerning tables, and the editor is designed to work with those, but it is alsoavailable as a stand-alone application.andP;  We reviewed Version 1.09, which isidentical to the final shipping version, lacking only a manual.andM;Installing Kerningware tables is quite simple.andP;  You place a font suitcasefile in a folder along with the tables you want to install and theKerningware application itself.andP;  You launch Kerningware Editor, open thesuitcase from within the editor and choose the Install command.andP;  The editorautomatically installs the correct table in the font.andM;The kerning tables sold by Kerningware contain about 2,000 kerning pairs foreach font, with bold, italic and bold italic styles considered as separatefonts with their own kerning tables.andP;  Large kerning tables exact aperformance penalty during text composition and printing, and 2,000 kerningpairs is overkill for most purposes.andP;  Kerningware has no means of displayingthe kerning tables themselves.andP;  Instead, it provides filters and statisticaltools to help you reduce the number of pairs to whatever level you decide isreasonable.andM;The first set of tools are language filters.andP;  The English language filterincludes a list of consonant pairs that do not occur in English.andP;  You use itto remove those pairs from the kerning table.andP;  Filters for other languageswill be made available.andM;The Statistics command determines the most common kerning value.andP;  Subtractingthat amount from the entire table sets all pairs having that value to zerowhile leaving the relative character spacing unchanged.andP;  The Delete ZeroPairs com-mand then removes them.andP;  You can also specify a range of kerningvalues and set all pairs within that range to zero, or you can zero pairsbased on either their first or second character.andM;After weeding out unnecessary pairs, you print a test sheet using the PrintSample command (using any text file as the sample).andP;  Then you fine-tunesuspect pairs in the Editor window.andP;  The results are saved to a new fontsuitcase file that is automatically named with a &quot;.k&quot; suffix.andM;KernEdit.andP;  KernEdit from Pairs Soft-ware Inc. of Toronto departs from theMacintosh interface more than any of the other packages here, yet it providesan easy-to-use WYSIWYG kerning environment.andP;  All editing takes place in asingle window with buttons and pop-up menus.andM;When you launch KernEdit, it prompts you to open a font suitcase file.andP;  Uponopening the suitcase file, the Editor window appears.andP;  A pop-up font menulets you select any of the fonts in the suitcase file.andP;  You can work on onlyone font at a time, but you can kerning all the fonts in the suitcase filewithout closing the Editor window.andM;The most noticeable feature in the Kern-Edit window is the kerning areaitself.andP;  Rather than display only the current pair, KernEdit uses a featurecalled WordView that displays the pair in the context of a word.andP;  TheWordView pop-up menu shows all the words in the word list that contain thecurrent pair.andP;  You can add new words to the list by clicking the Wordsbutton.andM;The active pair is marked by a small triangular adjustment handle that youcan drag to adjust the kerning value.andP;  When you drag the handle, thecharacters move in real time, providing instantaneous visual feedback.andP;  Forfiner adjustment, you can click one of two arrows to increase or reduce thekerning value by one one-thousandth of an em space.andP;  Clicking the squarebetween the arrows sets the kerning value to zero.andM;Other kerned pairs in the word are marked with a small black square, whilepairs with no kerning value have a small white square.andP;  You can jump toanother pair by clicking on the square.andP;  A scrollable list at the left of thewindow displays all the pairs in the current font.andP;  You can step through themby clicking or by using the arrow keys on the keyboard.andP;  If you jump toanother pair in the WordView then use an arrow key to go to the next orprevious pair, KernEdit remembers your place in the list.andM;An Inheritance feature lets you automatically adjust accented pairs, such as&quot;er,&quot; &quot;er&quot; and &quot;er,&quot; to the same kerning value as the unaccented pair &quot;er.&quot;andO;You can also kern these pairs individually.andM;When you've adjusted all the kerning pairs to your satisfaction, you clickthe Done button.andP;  KernEdit then gives you the choice of saving either to anew font file, which it names by adding the suffix &quot;.k&quot; to the originalsuitcase name, or to a KernEdit data table that you can load into otherfonts.andM;The documentation is scanty, but the intuitive operation and an excellentcontext-sensitive Help feature make the manual largely unnecessary.andM;In addition to KernEdit, Pairs also sells packages of kerning data tables.andO;Each package contains from 21 to 26 tables, for four or five font families.andM;Conclusions.andP;  All the kerning programs reviewed here do the basic jobadequately.andP;  Your choice should be based on how much use you intend to makeof the program and any special features you need.andP;  Generally, the moreexpensive packages offer more functionality.andP;  You should also determinewhether you need pre-prepared kerning tables, which only some of the packageshave.andP;  nandM;EDCO Services Inc.andM;LetrTuck Plus (with tables for LaserWriter Plus font set): $147andM;(813) 962-7800andM;ICOM SimulationsandM;MacKern: $195andM;(312) 520-4440andM;KerningwareandM;Kerningware Editor: $150;

 LetrTuck's insistence that you close all open fonts makes itof limited usefulness to Suitcase II or MasterJuggler users.andP;  The limitationsof both programs make them less than ideal for high-volume work, althougheither would be adequate for the casual kerner.andM;ICOM Simulations' MacKern is the most Mac-like of all the packages we lookedat, with the best documentation and on-line help.andP;  It's also the mostexpensive.andP;  However, its close adherence to the Mac interface and the easewith which you can work on multiple fonts make it a good value for the money.andM;Kerningware's Kerningware Editor is quite different from any of the otherpackages.andP;  Although some of the advanced features were difficult to usewithout the manual, we were able to speedily load and modify the tablessupplied, with excellent results.andP;  If you buy kerning tables fromKerningware, the Editor will suffice, but if you want to create tables fromscratch you'd be better served by one of the other packages.andM;Pairs Software's KernEdit doesn't follow the Macintosh user interface, butits unique WordView feature provides the best on-screen feedback foradjusting kerning.andP;  Its intuitive -- if non-standard -- interface,file-handling system and context-sensitive help make it easy to use.andP;  If wehad to pick one of these programs, we'd choose KernEdit, with MacKern runninga close second.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
