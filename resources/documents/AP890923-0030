Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell, D-Maine, and Sen. MaxBaucus, D-Mont., on Friday predicted their agreement would winsupport for clean air legislation. The compromise is not included inPresident Bush's clean air plan, which is being considered by aHouse subcommittee.   Both the administration and Baucus-Mitchell plans are designed toreduce the major component of acid rain, sulfur dioxide, by 10million tons _ and prevent any growth of emissions after thereductions are achieved.   The Bush bill would require the reduction by the end of the year2000 and the Mitchell-Baucus requires the improvement by Jan. 1,2000.   The agreement would exempt states from making further sulfurdioxide reductions through the start of 2000, if more than one halfof their coal-fired power plants utilize pollution-reducingequipment called scrubbers.   The provision would benefit Montana, Kansas, Minnesota, NorthDakota, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming, according to a list handed outby the senators.   Acid rain is formed in the atmosphere from sulfur dioxide andnitrogen oxide, and is carried hundreds of miles before raining downto earth. Acid rain destroys aquatic life in lakes and streams,damages trees in forests and can damage human lungs.</TEXT><NOTE>Illegal Decisions to Deny Treatment to Handicapped Said to Persist</NOTE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Some doctors and hospitals illegally denylifesaving treatment to infants born with severe physical and mentaldisabilities, says a government report.   Decisions to withhold medical treatment, food and fluids to thesedisabled children in many instances occur with the cooperation offederal, state and local government agencies, despite a federal lawprohibiting the practice, concluded the study released Friday.   The 500-page report, ``Medical Discrimination Against Childrenwith Disabilities,'' was released by the U.S. Commission on CivilRights.   The study's conclusions are based on anecdotal evidence, anexamination of how hospital infant-care review committees and childprotection agencies have enforced the law, and a national randomsurvey of physician attitudes published late last year.   In that survey, 75 percent of the responding physicians said theywould be neutral or would discourage surgery for infants with spinabifida and another severe disability, hydrocephalus.   The study concludes that decisions to deny such treatment oftenare not made on the basis of medical judgments and arediscriminatory.</TEXT><NOTE>Pork Bellies Destined for Poland</NOTE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Between 7,000 and 10,000 metric tons of porkbellies will be sent to Poland as part of a U.S. aid packagepromised by President Bush, says Agriculture Secretary ClaytonYeutter.
