However, the article itself did not address this important issue.    My recent research suggests that the enforcement of penalties for employee misconduct is extremely important for organizational learning and for maintaining the social system within the organization. Workers who are aware of unethical conduct expect it to be disciplined, and they expect the discipline to be harsh. Their attitudes and emotions are more positive in these situations than in situations where management reacts ambiguously or not at all. If the misconduct is not disciplined, other employees begin to question the organization's fairness and justness.    Most important is the connection employees make between conduct and expected outcomes. If the organization rewards ethical behavior and disciplines unethical behavior, employees will expect the same for themselves and they will more likely make ethical decisions. If the connection is unclear or in support of unethical behavior, unethical behavior is the likely result. These research findings suggest that ethics codes must be clearly tied to the organization's reward systems if they are to effectively influence employee behavior.
