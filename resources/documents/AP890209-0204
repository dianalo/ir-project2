WILLIAMS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Fifty years after the outbreak of World War II, the1989 Berlin International Film Festival has paused for reflection onthe conflict that divided Europe and is probing the scars itinflicted throughout the world.   The 39th annual film event has set no specific war theme for thisyear's contest and will in fact exhibit some prominent entriesdelving into unrelated subjects, such as Alan Parker's ``MississippiBurning'' and Barry Levinson's ``Rain Man.''   But the festival, which opened Feb. 10, has coupled the GoldenBear competition with a retrospective marking what would have beenthe 100th birthday of German-American producer Erich Pommer, and ashowing of films made in 1939 that appear to have inspired Europeanfilmmakers to take another look at those troubled times.   As a tribute to Pommer, who fled Nazi Germany the year AdolfHitler took power and returned after the war to rebuild the nation'sfilm industry, the festival will screen 34 of the prolificproducer's works, including ``The Blue Angel'' starring MarleneDietrich, and several films directed by his lifelong associate FritzLang. Pommer died in Los Angeles in 1966.   The wartime thread running through the festival is enhanced bythe memorial series ``Europa 1939,'' which resurrects 50 filmsproduced that year in 10 European nations, giving audiences a fulltaste of the society, culture and politics of a continent on thebrink of disaster.   An accompanying forum for young filmmakers likewise breathes inthe historical atmosphere of Europe a half century after Hitler'smarch began. Max Ophuls' critically acclaimed documentary, ``HotelTerminus'' recounts the role of Lyon Gestapo chief Klaus Barbie.American filmmakers have offered ``Lodz Ghetto,'' about the largestJewish ghetto set up by the Nazis, and ``Vienna Is Different,''confronting Austrians' historical consciousness following theexposure of Austrian President Kurt Waldheim's Nazi past.   The 12-day festival combines the international competition forthe award for best new feature film with a number of other contests,premieres, exhibits and markets to draw thousands of the filmindustries most prominent directors, producers, cinema operators andfilm buffs to Berlin.   Among the dozens of films to be shown for the first time outsidetheir country of origin are Woody Allen's ``Another Woman,'' and thefirst-ever joint film production by East Germany and West Germany,``The Break,'' which follows the chaotic lives of a handful ofBerliners in 1946.   While East Germany has failed to embrace the broader freedoms``glasnost'' has brought to the arts in much of the Soviet bloc,West German filmmakers and other artists are hoping ``The Break''signals a new willingness among their socialist countrymen to worktogether in cultural and entertainment fields.   Twenty-two full-length feature films are entered in the maincompetition, with U.S. filmmakers out front with four entries.   In ``The Summer of Aviya,'' directed by Israel's Eli Cohen, ayoung girl learns to cope with the mental instability of her mother,a survivor of the Auschwitz concentration camp.   Japanese director Yoji Yamada conveys in ``Hope and Pain'' thepost-war resettling of some school children and their eventualrebellion against the imposed American order.   ``American Stories,'' from Chantal Akerman of Belgium, relatestales told by those who fled war-torn Europe from their perspectiveas immigrants in New York, and China's ``Evening Bell'' by directorWu Ziniu recounts a last-ditch attempt by Japanese troops to escapecapture in the final days of World War II.   Entries from the United States include ``Mississippi Burning,'' afictionalized account of the murder of three civil rights workers inthe 1960s; ``Talk Radio,'' Oliver Stone's story of a late-night talkshow host driven by ambition to exploit his lonely listeners; ``TheAccused,'' Jonathan Kaplan's account of a gang rape and its legalaftermath; and ``Rain Man,'' about the relationship that evolvesbetween an autistic man and his self-seeking younger brother.   Running throughout the festival will be 30 new full-length WestGerman films and 46 from other nations, as well as the European FilmMarket offering more than 350 films for sale.   Of the top 10 box-office successes in West German cinemas thismonth, seven are American comedies or thrillers.   The only West German film offered at the festival that has beenenjoying much popular success is ``Herbstmilch'' (``Autumn Milk''),a sad but beautifully filmed true-life story of a young woman'shardships in wartime Bavaria.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Mon AMs, Feb. 13</NOTE></DOC>
