He, like some of the 1,700 workers who will be laid off whenDodge Omni and Plymouth Horizon production stops, has been throughfactory shutdowns before.   ``It closed down for a couple of weeks before,'' Coleman said ofthe plant on Detroit's east side. ``It won't make too much of adifference.''   The Jefferson Avenue plant, one of the industry's oldest,eventually will be demolished, and part of the land under it willbe incorporated into the Jefferson North plant, now being builtnext to the old plant.   Many of the laid off employees will be offered jobs at theJefferson North plant in a year and a half or so, when trainingbegins for workers who will begin production of a new sport-utilityvehicle in late 1992.   And while the Jefferson North plant will offer some money forthe workers in late 1991, it's providing income for Coleman and hisemployees now.   ``We have the construction workers,'' the restaurant managersaid.   When the Jefferson Avenue plant officially closes with the endof its only shift Friday afternoon, no one is going to look back,get a little misty-eyed and turn off the light.   Hundreds of workers will show up Monday and beyond, cleaning up,salvaging some equipment and getting the buildings ready forrazing. The United Auto Workers union, nonetheless, says it wasbetrayed by Chrysler.   A hand-painted sign taped on the door to UAW Local 7, across thestreet from the Jefferson North construction site, takes a swipe atChrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca: ``Lido said: Trust me. He lied _ UAWLocal 7.''   Just over a year ago, Chrysler closed its Kenosha, Wis.,assembly plant and put 5,500 workers on layoff with no new factoryto employ them. It was a move union, state and local officialsdecried, saying Chrysler, and Iacocca specifically, had promisedthat the plant would stay open longer.   The Kenosha plant was closed when Chrysler moved Omni-Horizonproduction to Jefferson Avenue. Now, the company says it can't sellenough of the small cars to keep the Detroit plant open.   On Thursday, Chrysler announced it would close its St. Louis carplant Sept. 21, seven months after it cuts production there inhalf. The company will lay off 3,700 workers in all.   The UAW has contested the Jefferson Avenue plant closing, sayingthe company could have done a better job of marketing orredesigning the cars to boost sales.   For months, workers at the Jefferson Avenue plant have walked toand from their jobs past a moonscape of barren land slowly beingtransformed into the Jefferson North plant.   For some workers, like Walt Harris of Detoit, Jefferson North isthe future. During the time he's laid off and the time he hopes toreport for retraining, he plans to take law classes at Wayne StateUniversity in Detroit.   ``Then, hopefully, I'll be back at Jefferson North,'' saidHarris, who has worked for Chrysler for 23 years.   Closing an assembly plant is like an H-bomb in an automaker'sarsenal as it fights to hold profits in a fickle industry. Withdemand for new cars slipping and competition from U.S.-builtJapanese models growing, it's a tactic American companies haveresorted to increasingly.   Since 1987, U.S. automakers have shut down 13 assembly plants,laying off tens of thousands of workers in assembly and componentplants.   Laid off union workers can qualify for a variety of benefitsdesigned to get them up to 95 percent of their take-home pay beforeovertime. But some workers, like Local 7 member Eddie Jordan, aveteran at Jefferson Avenue, doubt whether the benefit funds haveenough money to maintain that level as more workers draw from it.   Still, he said the Jefferson Avenue closing is different thanthe others because of the job possibilities offered by JeffersonNorth.   The Jefferson Avenue plant began making cars in 1907 and thefirst vehicle bearing a Chrysler nameplate rolled off the assemblyline 17 years later. Nearly 9 million cars and trucks have beenbuilt at the plant.   Chrysler spokesman Doug Nicoll said the company will keep the 41acres north of Jefferson Avenue and incorporate them into JeffersonNorth. The future of another 104 acres south of the originalcomplex is undecided.   Chrysler plans other cutbacks in its drive to trim $1 billionfrom its $26 billion budget by 1991.   Beginning Feb. 12, the nation's No. 3 automaker will cut oneshift from its St. Louis car plant, putting 1,900 people onindefinite layoff. The company also is indefinitely laying offhundreds of workers as part of other production cutbacks nationwide.   Some analysts have predicted the St. Louis factory and someCanadian plants may have to close entirely or be consolidated tocut costs.   The cuts aren't unique to Chrysler.   General Motors Corp. in mid-March will shut its Lakewoodassembly plant in Atlanta, putting 2,500 workers on indefinitelayoff. The nation's largest automaker also is cutting a shift eachfrom its Doraville, Ga., and Linden, N.J., assembly plants.   About 15,400 workers will lose or have lost their jobs at 11 GMor Chrysler assembly plants because of indefinite layoffs betweenJanuary and September.</TEXT></DOC>
