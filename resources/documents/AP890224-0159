Hundreds of Indians, wearing colored feathers, beads and red andblack paint, stood and chanted their support as Indian leader AiltonKrenac read an appeal to protect Amazonia, home to most of Brazil's220,000 native people.   ``We do not want the construction of dams on the Xingu River andon other rivers in the Amazon, because they threaten Indiannations,'' he said. The mostly white audience of townspeople andrepresentatives of environmental groups cheered and applauded.   More than 500 Indians from about 40 native groups met for fivedays in this eastern Amazon city, 2,000 miles northwest of Rio deJaneiro, to protest the proposed Belo Monte Dam on the Xingu River,an Amazon tributary. It was the first time Indians in Brazil setaside longstanding tribal rivalries and banded together in apolitical movement.   The reservoir of the $5.8 billion dam would flood 500 squaremiles of rain forest. The dam would have a generating capacity of 11million kilowatts _ 40 percent more than that of Grand Coulee, thebiggest hydroelectric dam in the United States.   ``For a long time, the white man has ignored our thinking and thespirit of our ancestors. Now this must stop. Our territory is thesacred site of our people, the home of our creator that cannot beviolated,'' Krenac said.   The government contends Brazil must tap the vast hydroelectricpotential of the Amazon basin to progress. Federal electric powerofficials at the gathering told the Indians that dams will be built.Earlier in the week, one Indian woman thrust a machete just inchesfrom the face of an electricity company representative. Other tribalpeople said that was merely a symbolic gesture.   Congressman Tadeu Franca, pledged to carry on the Indians' fightin Brasilia, the capital. ``Because of this meeting, it will beIndians, working together _ not some presidential decree _ that willbuild the Indians' history,'' he said.   ``Nothing like this has ever happened before. The Indians will goback to their villages with the sense that something really new andimportant has happened,'' said Terry Turner, a U.S. anthropologistwho has worked more than 20 years with the Kayapo Indians.   Construction of the dam is scheduled to start in 1993. It mustfirst be approved by Congress.   Brazil has shown interest in getting partial financing for theproject from the World Bank, but Indians and environmental groupsare asking the Washington-based institution not to put up any money.   In a small victory this week, the Indians won an agreement fromthe government electric power company in Amazonia to change the nameof the project to Belo Monte from Kararao. Kararao is a war cry ofthe Kayapo tribe and was offensive to other tribes.</TEXT></DOC>
