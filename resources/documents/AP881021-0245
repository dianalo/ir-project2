BOLT</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   RJR Nabisco Inc. managers dropped a $17 billionbombshell by disclosing they are considering a buyout of the foodand tobacco company at that price, which would make it the largesttakeover in history.   Analysts speculated the move was designed to dissuade unwantedsuitors from approaching Nabisco, maker of Winston and Camelcigarettes, Oreo cookies and Ritz crackers.   Thursday's announcement that a group led by president and chiefexecutive F. Ross Johnson is mulling a $75-a-share offer to takeNabisco private sent the company's stock soaring. In heavy tradingon the New York Stock Exchange, Nabisco jumped $21.37{ a share to$77.25, and observers predicted the price will go higher.   Lawrence Adelman, an analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.,priced Nabisco at between $90 and $100 a share and said Johnson``is trying to steal the company'' at $75 a share.   Analysts viewed the move as a ``pre-emptive strike'' designed toward off other unwanted bidders at a time when the takeoverspotlight is shining brightly on major food companies.   On Monday, Philip Morris Cos. Inc. offered more than $11 billionfor processed foods manufacturer Kraft Inc. The following day,Pillsbury Co. rejected a $5.23 billion tender offer launched byBritain's Grand Metropolitan PLC.   Neal Kaplan, an analyst with Interstate-Johnson Lane inCharlotte, N.C., said Nabisco ``may be recognizing that others maybe looking at them.''   At the same time, he said, Nabisco executives see Philip Morrispaying ``20-odd times earnings for Kraft and say, `We can spend allour money and buy ourselves, which we know is good.'''   He viewed the buyout proposal as a continuation of Nabisco'sstrategy of buying back its own stock. On July 31, the company had225 million shares outstanding, down from 247 million at the end of1987. At $75 a share, the buyout proposal currently is worth about$16.88 billion.   Nabisco said Johnson and Edward A. Horrigan Jr., chief executiveof the company's tobacco business, had notified the company they``intend to seek to develop, with a financial partner, a proposalto acquire RJR Nabisco in a leveraged buyout merger transaction.''   Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., which is advising the managementgroup, would provide equity and financing for the deal.   The company said late Thursday the offer will be reviewed by aspecial committee of outside directors led by Chairman Charles E.Hugel. Leaving the door open for a bidding war, the committee alsosaid it will review ``any other acquisition interest that may bepresented.''   While some analysts suggested a buyout would have to reach atleast $85 a share to be successful, Kaplan said a $75 ``looks likea darn good number.''   At that level, he said, the company could pay off new debtthrough revenues, a strategy that would be more difficult at ahigher price.   In a leveraged buyout, the buyer borrows the money to buy thecompany, then pays off the debt either through company revenue orselling off parts of the operation.   Today's editions of the Wall Street Journal quoted peoplefamiliar with the management group's strategy as saying it intendsto utterly transform the tobacco-and-food conglomerate, largely bydivesting as much of its non-tobacco businesses as necessary to payoff debt.   Like other tobacco companies, Nabisco's stock has been drivenlower by worries over cigarette liability suits. `Valuing Nabiscoas a food company and discounting the tobacco operation, I arriveat a value somewhere between $85 and $90'' a share, said PavlosAlexandrakis, an analyst with Argus Research Corp. in New York.   If the deal were completed, it would be the biggest leveragedbuyout of an American corporation, widely surpassing the $6.1billion buyout of Beatrice Cos. by an investment group led byKohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. in 1986.   It also would top the biggest corporate acquisition, the $13.4billion purchase of Gulf Corp. by Chevron Corp. in 1984.   In the quarter ended Sept. 30, Nabisco said it earned $355million on sales of $4.16 billion, compared to $320 million inprofits and sales of $3.84 billion in the same quarter last year.   Income from tobacco operations was $497 million in the quarteron sales of $1.78 billion, while food income accounted for $276million on $2.38 billion in sales.   RJR Nabisco was formed when the tobacco company R.J. ReynoldsIndustries Inc. bought Nabisco Brands Inc., the food and consumerproducts giant, for $4.9 billion in 1985. Today the company ranksas the nation's 19th largest industrial concern.   Johnson came to the conglomerate from Nabisco and last yearshifted the company's headquarters from Winston-Salem, N.C., toAtlanta in a move seen as an attempt to distance the company fromits tobacco beginnings.   Among the company's major products are Salem cigarettes, LornaDoone and Mallomar cookies, Chuckles and Junior Mints candy, DelMonte vegetables and Milk-Bone dog biscuits.   Nabisco currently is test-marketing a smokeless cigarette,Premier.   In 1987, RJR Nabisco had profits of $1.18 billion on sales of$15.77 billion. That level of sales would make RJR Nabisco thethird largest privately held company in the country according toForbes magazine, behind Cargill, a commodity trading company, andSafeway Stores Inc., the grocery chain.   In the past few years, the company has sold off divisions,including Kentucky Fried Chicken, that did not fit with itslong-range plans.</TEXT></DOC>
