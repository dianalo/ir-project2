Glitman was testifying about the effect of article 14, aprovision which says that neither side shall do anything, now or inthe future, to undercut the pact.   Sen. Dan Quayle, R-Ind., told Glitman that ``I'm concerned aboutarticle 14'' because it might limit future U.S. aid to NATO nations.   The provision is a standard clause added to other treaties whichsimply restates the intention of both nations to abide by the pact,Glitman said.   The treaty spells out in great detail what each side cannot doand anything is permitted if it is not prohibited, said Glitman.   For example, said Glitman, the treaty doesn't ban the transferof U.S. technology to NATO nations such as Great Britain to developground-launched cruise missiles. Those U.S. missiles will be bannedby the treaty but the British could go ahead and build their own,he said.   Glitman said U.S. negotiators resisted Soviet efforts to blockU.S. help for NATO. ``We knew their goal was to find a way to put abrake on NATO activities,'' he said.   President Reagan pledged today that the United States will doits part to ensure that the NATO alliance remains strong, saying inan address broadcast to Europe that ``our destiny is coupled withyours.''   In the address, which came a week before a NATO summit meeting,Reagan reaffirmed the alliance agreement that an attack on anymember nation is an attack against all of them. ``Simply put, anattack on Munich is the same as an attack on Chicago,'' he said.   Glitman's testimony was part of a detailed examination of thepact, a line-by-line scrutiny which legislators said was necessaryto avoid possible conflicts with future administrations over thetreaty's meaning.   ``It is very regrettable that we have to go through this,''Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga., said Monday toGlitman.   Nunn and other Democrats noted that the scrutiny arises fromcongressional distrust of the executive branch, a skepticism bornof the fight over the meaning of an earlier treaty.   Nunn noted the State Department had delivered 31 volumes ofrecords about how U.S.-Soviet negotiators reached theIntermediate-range Nuclear Forces pact signed by President Reaganand Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.   Committee staffers spent 300 hours reviewing only three volumesof records that preceded the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty,Nunn said.   The Armed Services panel is one of three Senate committeesexamining the INF treaty. Ratification by the full Senate isexpected but the votes will be delayed until after Nunn's committeefinishes it close examination, Nunn told his colleagues Monday.   Ratification would require a two-thirds vote.   The distrust arose from a dispute between theDemocratic-controlled Congress and the Reagan administration overthe meaning of the ABM pact, particularly how it would affectReagan's Star Wars missile-defense research program.   The existing ``narrow'' interpretation of the ABM pact would bansome tests of the Strategic Defense Initiative, as Star Wars isformally known. But Reagan has asserted that his administration hasthe right to unilaterally move to a ``broad'' view of the pact thatwould permit SDI tests.   Nunn led a congressional fight to block the move to a ``broad''view of the ABM pact and promised to delay the INF ratificationuntil the administration promised that current testimony on the INFpact was ``authoritative.''   Administration officials had argued that the 1973 executivebranch testimony on the ABM pact wasn't ``authoritative.''   Nunn told Glitman that committee staff members had drawn up 135questions, many of them technical, about possible ambiguities inthe treaty.   Two other Democrats on the committee supported Nunn's decisionto scrutinize the INF pact.   Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, said, ``I'm sorry there was areinterpretation of the ABM treaty that made this necessary.'' Sen.James Exon, D-Neb., said, ``It's sad we have to go through theexercise we're going through here.''   Meantime, Dr. Edward Teller, the physicist who is considered thefather of both SDI and the hydrogen bomb, supported the treaty intestimony before the Foreign Relations Committee.   Teller noted that he deeply distrusts the Soviets and said, ``mypersonal approach (to the treaty) is careful, doubtful, yetpositive.''   Teller termed the fights over the meaning of the treaty``senseless debates.''</TEXT></DOC>
