Will Name Rentschler Today   To Chief's Post, Industry Officials Say   ----   By Judith Valente   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>06/19/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE B10</SO><CO>   WNEWS NWA X.BCI</CO><IN>AIRLINES (AIR)</IN><LP>   NWA Inc., parent of Northwest Airlines, is expected toname Frederick B. Rentschler as its new president and chiefexecutive officer today, industry officials said.   Mr. Rentschler is currently president and chief executiveofficer of Beatrice Co., the Chicago food company thatentered into a merger agreement with ConAgra Inc. two weeksago.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Rentschler, 50 years old, would succeed Frederic V.Malek, a member of the investor group led by Alfred A.Checchi that acquired NWA last year. Mr. Malek would stay onas NWA's vice chairman.   Mr. Rentschler's appointment means that the top threemanagement positions at NWA will be held by executives withno previous airline experience. For seven months, the companyhas been run by Mr. Checchi, Mr. Malek and Gary Wilson, allformer Marriott Corp. executives. Mr. Wilson's only otherairline experience was as an NWA director.   Mr. Checchi has tapped other non-airline executives forkey roles. Only two of the five vice presidents he has hiredsince become chairman last September have ever worked for anairline.   Mr. Checchi is said to have selected Mr. Rentschlerbecause of his strong consumer-marketing background.Northwest is trying to shed a reputation for lacklusterservice. The Checchi group has said its goal is to makeNorthwest the airline of choice for business travelers, whousually pay the highest fares.   Toward that end, Northwest plans to spend $422 millionover the next five years improving its food, upgrading itsaircraft interiors and retraining its employees.   Mr. Rentschler is credited with turning around theSwift/Hunt-Wesson foods division of Esmark Inc. beforeBeatrice acquired that company. He was forced out in amanagement shake-up in 1984 after the Beatrice takeover. Hereturned to Beatrice in 1986 after its acquisition byKohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., the New York leveraged buy-outfirm.   Mr. Rentschler's future was uncertain at Beatrice in lightof the merger with ConAgra, an Omaha, Neb., food concern.However, officials familiar with the situation said Mr.Rentschler's NWA appointment had been in the works for weeks.   Mr. Rentschler couldn't be reached. NWA declined tocomment. Mr. Checchi is expected to announce Mr. Rentschler'sappointment today at a press conference in NWA's St. Paul,Minn., headquarters.   Whether Northwest suffers from its top management's lackof airline expertise remains to be seen. A number of its vicepresidents and middle managers, including its operations andmarketing chiefs, have extensive airline experience.   Although the Checchi team is getting high marks from theNWA staff, some employees expressed concern about Mr. Malek'soutside activities. For the past several months, he split histime between NWA and his duties as chief organizer of aseven-nation economic summit planned for next month.   Mr. Malek, a friend and adviser to President Bush, isexpected to play an increasing role in the Bushadministration. That factor led to his decision to step downfrom day-to-day duties at Northwest, people familiar with thedecision said.   Northwest, the result of a 1986 merger between NorthwestOrient Airlines and Republic Airlines, is the nation's fourthlargest carrier. It is the largest U.S. carrier to the NorthPacific, a region that produces about a third of its revenue.It has spent the past three years expanding its European anddomestic routes as well.   The Checchi group acquired NWA for $3.65 billion lastAugust. The airline had a first-quarter operating loss of$89.8 million on revenue of $1.62 billion. It has forecast amodest profit, its first since the takeover, for the secondquarter.</TEXT></DOC>
