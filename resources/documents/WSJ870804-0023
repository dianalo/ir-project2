Garcia</HL><DD> 08/04/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)STOCK INDEXES (NDX) </IN><TEXT>   Concern about heightened tensions in the Middle East derailed the stock market's recent advance as prices fell in active trading.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average, after climbing for eight consecutive sessions, fell 14.99 to 2557.08. The decline came despite gains in many of the oil and oil-related stocks in the average, including Exxon, up 3 3/8 to 97 1/2; Chevron, up 1 1/2 to 62; Texaco, up 1/2 to 46 3/4; Du Pont, up 2 7/8 to 127 3/4; and USX, up 1/4 to 38 3/8. Both Du Pont and USX have major oil subsidiaries.    Worries about the Middle East stem from Iran's vow to avenge the death of more than 400 people, mostly Iranians, killed in clashes with police at the Moslem shrine of Mecca in Saudi Arabia. The Iranians blamed the U.S. for the incident and called on Moslems to attack U.S. and Saudi Arabian interests.    &quot;Wall Street is very sensitive to what is happening in the Persian Gulf,&quot; said Joseph Barthel, a technical analyst with Butcher andamp; Singer in Philadelphia.    Precious metals prices moved higher on the news. Crude oil prices soared on expectations that if hostilities do break out in the Middle East, oil supplies from the Persian Gulf could be curtailed. These events rekindled fears of higher inflation, traders said.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped over 20 points in the first few minutes of trading. The market had recovered all its losses when the sell-off was renewed in the final hours.    Traders said some sell programs, tied to strategies using stock-index futures, accelerated the decline in the last hour. Oil-related and mining stocks advanced, despite the downturn in the general market.    The broader averages ended lower. The Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index fell 1.09 to 317.57, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index dropped 0.57 to 178.07. Decliners outnumbered gainers on the Big Board, 999 to 613, as volume rose to 207.8 million shares from 181.9 million shares Friday.    The American Stock Exchange's Major Market index, where about 10% of the companies are tied to energy and mining, rose 2.28 to 360.31.    &quot;When the stock market is in new-high ground, everything has to go pretty smoothly because investors are already nervous,&quot; said Hugh Johnson, chief investment strategist with First Albany. The news of growing tensions in the Middle East &quot;was a curve ball thrown at the market over the weekend,&quot; he said.    Mr. Johnson expects some further weakness in the market as investors decide not to purchase stocks as they wait to see if there is a flare-up in the Persian Gulf. The turmoil in the bond market and forthcoming economic statistics, such as the July employment report, might also give investors reasons to pause, he said.    Mr. Barthel noted that even before yesterday's decline, negative sentiment in the stock market was growing. The pessimistic outlook could be seen in the large number of put options -- which give a holder the right to sell a stock at a certain price -- that investors were buying even as the market advanced last week. Such a strategy is usually an insurance policy against declining stock prices. The strong buying of put options continued yesterday.    Mr. Barthel believes the market can work against such bearish investors, spoiling their expectations. He says a little weakness now might just be a pause before another big push forward.    Concern about interruption of oil shipments was on investors' minds as both domestic and international oil stocks advanced. Fred Leuffer, an oil analyst with Cyrus J. Lawrence in New York, said investors were equating higher oil prices with higher earnings for these companies and higher valuations for their assets in the ground.    Among the gainers were Atlantic Richfield, up 2 1/4 to 98; Unocal, up 2 1/8 to 44 7/8; Phillips Petroleum, up 1/2 to 18 3/8; Mobil, up 2 3/8 to 54 7/8; British Petroleum, up 2 to 76 1/4; Royal Dutch Petroleum, up 2 to 140 1/2; Shell Transport andamp; Trading, up 1 7/8 to 96; and Occidental Petroleum, up 3/4 to 38 3/8. The stocks of oil drilling and oilfield equipment and service companies were mostly higher.    Gold, mining and natural resource stocks also advanced. Newmont Mining rose 6 to 75 1/4, Homestake Mining added 2 3/8 to 44 5/8, Echo Bay Mines moved up 3 3/8 to 28, ASA rose 3 3/8 to 72 7/8, Aluminum Co. of America climbed 1/4 to 63 1/2, Lac Minerals added 1 5/8 to 35 1/4, Phelps Dodge increased 1 1/2 to 49 3/4 and Reynolds Metals gained 1 1/2 to 53 1/4.    Technology, drug, chemical, paper and forest product stocks were among the losers. So were interest-rate sensitive stocks such as bank, thrift, utility and insurance issues. Declines in airline stocks dragged down the Dow Jones Transportation Average 9.35 to 1067.31.    Kidde added 3/4 to 64 1/4. The company said it has received formal proposals to acquire all or a substantial part of the company. There were rumors that Hanson Trust was interested in acquiring the company. Kidde declined to comment.    SmithKline Beckman broke away from other drug issues, gaining 2 5/8 to 71 3/4. The company announced a joint venture with Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals of Tokyo to develop and market drugs in Japan.    American Electric Power eased 1/4 to 27 1/8 on trading of more than 27.4 million shares, making it the most active Big Board issue. The stock, which yields 8.3%, begins trading ex-dividend today.    Allegheny International gained 3/8 to 17 1/8. An investor group led by Minneapolis investor Irwin Jacobs said it holds a 7.9% stake in the company and seeks control of it.    Stewart-Warner jumped 6 1/2 to 35 1/2. Ametek agreed to sell its 10% stake in Stewart-Warner to a unit of BTR of London for &quot;no less&quot; than $33 a share. Later, the unit offered to acquire the rest of Stewart-Warner for $33 a share.    Export-led Japanese stocks, weak in Tokyo early yesterday, continued their decline in New York trading. Among the losers, Matsushita Electric Industrial sank 6 to 167, Hitachi fell 4 1/4 to 78 1/2, Honda Motor lost 4 3/4 to 111 and Kyocera declined 3 1/8 to 83.    (Revised WSJ Aug. 5, 1987)</TEXT></DOC>
