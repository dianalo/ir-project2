(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The rail line wrecked by a runawaytrain that leveled homes, killing four people, reopened Tuesdayafter Southern Pacific and the city reached an agreement headingoff a threatened court order.   The first train down the Cajon Pass rolled past the site of theaccident at 4:05 p.m., and the second train followed 40 minuteslater, said Southern Pacific spokesman Jerry Pera.   City Attorney James Penman, with city council authorization toseek an injunction keeping the track closed, insisted on anagreement requiring that the railroad buy 11 properties damaged inthe accident Friday.   Southern Pacific had agreed to buy seven $70,000 homes that weredemolished, and agreed Tuesday afternoon to buy the other four andaccepted the city's demand for an undeveloped land buffer in caseof another derailment.   Southern Pacific also agreed to pay the costs of relocatingresidents and housing them for 90 days, pick up the city's cleanupcosts and defend San Bernardino in any lawsuit resulting from thewreck.   Penman said the agreement prevented a potentially protractedcourt fight. ``We know it is difficult to get an injunction againsta national transportation arm,'' he said.   Eight trains that normally use the line daily had been reroutedsince Friday, when a train traveling 90 mph jumped the tracks on acurve trains are supposed to take at 30 mph. Two boys in a home andtwo crewmen were killed.   Penman said the railroad complained that it is losing $1 milliona day while the track is closed.   The National Transportation Safety Board was winding downinterviews Tuesday. In a Monday night briefing, officials saidtrainman Larry Hill didn't tell the lead engineer about a set offailed brakes on the train.   Hill also told investigators that he failed to activateemergency brakes for 13 miles after first noticing a loss ofpressure in brake lines, officials said.   NTSB officials said there also was a chance the crew of the69-car Southern Pacific freight train was unaware of how heavytheir freight was and miscalculated the braking needed down thepass where the accident occurred.</TEXT></DOC>
