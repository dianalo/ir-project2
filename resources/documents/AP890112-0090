Mohammed Mehdi Shamseddine, acting chairman of the Higher ShiiteSupreme Council in Lebanon, spoke in an interview publishedWednesday in the London-based Saudi Arabian newspaper Al-SharqAl-Awsat.   He said that the prevailing view before had been that the hostageissue would move once the American presidential election campaignwas over. ``But we did not see anything on the horizon at the timeto indicate that.''   ``But I cautiously expect that after sufficient time has lapsedfollowing the new American president taking office that the issue ofthe hostages moves anew,'' he was quoted as saying.   There are 15 foreigners believed held hostage in Lebanon.   Shamseddine, who spent most of December in Tehran, recalled inthe interview that he had predicted before Iran accepted UnitedNations Resolution 598 _ the basis for the Iran-Iraq cease-fire thatwent into effect Aug. 20 _ that the hostage issue would grow morecomplex.   ``Contrary to the conviction prevailing at the time, we expectedthe issue of the Western hostages of Beirut to become morecomplicated. It seems our prediction was correct. For despite thepassage of more than five months after Iran's acceptance of 598,there has not been any progress whatsoever in the issue of thehostages,'' he was quoted as saying.   ``We still hold the same view. That the time has not yet come forthe issue of the hostages,'' he said.   Shamseddine said ``considerable prudence will be needed indealing with the hostage issue. But I say that ending the issue isnot going to take as much time as it took till now. Until when? I amnot in a position to state or speculate.''   Asked about links between the hostages and the fighting betweenShiite militias in south Beirut, where the hostaes are believedheld, he said he did not see a clear connection but there was a linkthat he could not talk about in the interview.   On the future of Iran's relations with Lebanon, he said that itwas intertwined with a Lebanese political settlement, noting thatTehran backed the predominately Moslem government of Salim Hoss.   Lebanon has had rival Moslem and Christian governments since itsParliament failed to elect a successor to President Amin Gemayelwhen his term expired Sept. 23, 1988.   The 15 foreign hostages include nine Americans. The longest heldis Terry A. Anderson, 41, chief Middle East correspondent for TheAssociated Press, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
