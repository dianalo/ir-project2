New materialsand techniques are often the decisive impulse for technical progress.New, efficient, and inexpensive structural materials play the centralpart in the realization of innovative concepts in the entire field ofmechanical engineering and of the construction of technical systems andplant, in transport, communications, and computer science. Over the lastyears, extensive research and development programmes have been initiatedin all industrially advanced countries. During the two-day SYMATEC Congressin Berne, experts from Germany, France, Italy, Liechtenstein, Switzerlandand the United States reported on the state of the art in matters ofmaterials and laminated materials engineering and on the outlook forthe immediate future.</TEXT></DOC>
