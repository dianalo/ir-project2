The 0.4 percent drop in the Commerce Department's Index ofLeading Economic Indicators announced Friday fits in with theconsensus among analysts that the final quarter of this year andthe first three months of 1990 will see weak growth at best.   ``The indicators are telling us what they'vebeen telling us forsome time and that is that the economy is continuing to expand, butat a slow rate,'' said economist David Berson of the FederalNational Mortgage Association.   However, he and other analysts said a number of factorsmitigated the unfavorable report. The decline followed two monthlygains; most of the weakness was concentrated in only two of theindex's 11 forward-looking business statistics.   And, elements of the index and a separate report on Octoberconstruction spending suggest that the Federal Reserve Board's cutsin interest rates since June are beginning to stimulate the economy.   Construction activity rose 1 percent in October, bolstered bythe first gain in single-family construction in nine months, theCommerce Department said.   Four of the 11 indicators were positive. Building permitsincreased 2.8 percent and the nation's money supply, reflectinglower interest rates, expanded modestly. Other positive signs werea slight increase in prices of sensitive materials, indicatingincreased demand, and an upturn in business capital investment.   October's overall drop, which was expected by most economists,followed gains of 0.3 percent in September and 0.6 percent inAugust. Both gains were revised in the report to reflect a slightlybetter increase than earlier reported.   For the first 10 months of 1989, the index has fallen fivetimes, risen four times and remained unchanged in one month.   The various changes left the index at 144.6 percent of its 1982base of 100. That represents a 0.4 percent decline at an annualrate for the year so far, compared with a 3.8 percent gain in thefirst 10 months of 1988.   ``The recent erratic fluctuations in the index are commensuratewith an economy that has slowed substantially but is not headedover a precipice,'' said economist Gordon Richards of the NationalAssociation of Manufacturers.   News of the October decline helped spark a stock market rallythat put the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials ahead by 41.38points at closing. Traders took the report as an indication theFed, which last nudged interest rates lower in early November,could move again. Optimism about the U.S.-Soviet summit meetingalso contributed to the rally.   The two biggest negatives in the index were an increase inclaims for unemployment insurance and a drop in average work weekfor factory workers.   The other weak signs were a drop in unfilled orders atfactories; a decline in a consumer confidence survey; fewer latedeliveries of factory goods, indicating slackening demand, andfewer new orders for consumer goods.   Stock prices, despite the Friday-the-13th plunge in October,were a neutral factor.   Traditionally, three consecutive monthly declines in the leadingindex are a good, but far from foolproof, indication that arecession is on the way. It has not fallen three times in a rowthis year, although it was down in May and June and flat in July.   Berson said the overall index has probably looked worse than thecondition of the economy would warrant. It overemphasizesmanufacturing, one of the economy's weakest sectors, andundercounts the service sector, one of the more resilient areas, hesaid.   The National Association of Purchasing Management, which tracksthe economy through a monthly survey of its members, said Fridaythe manufacturing economy weakened in November for the seventhstraight month and at a faster pace than in September and October.   In other economic news, the Office of Thrift Supervisionreported that the nation's savings and loans continue to shrink inresponse to tough new financial standards taking effect next week.Industry assets declined by $15.2 billion in September, breakingthe record of $13.3 billion set in August. Net deposit withdrawalstotaled $8.9 billion, the biggest outflow since February.</TEXT></DOC>
