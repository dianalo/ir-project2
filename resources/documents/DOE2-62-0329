Compound phase formation was analyzed based on results fromX-ray diffraction analysis. Al3Ti was identified in the titanium-layeredfilm after 450{sup 0}C sintering. TaSi2 and unreacted Ta. however, wereidentified after the sintering. Silicon participated in the phase formationprocess by incorporating itself as a solute in the Al3Ti while transformingTa into its silicide. This behavior is to be interpreted based on availableternary phase diagrams. Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopyresults indicate that well defined layered films and columnar grainsof aluminum were obtained which are believed to be the primary reasonsfor the observed electromigration improvement over the base metal.</TEXT></DOC>
