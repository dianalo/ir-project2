MARTINEZ</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Mobil Corp., long a proponent of doing businessin South Africa, said Friday it was leaving the racially-dividednation after 90 years of business there and will take a net loss of$140 million on the move.   The withdrawal of Mobil, the largest American company doingbusiness in South Africa, leaves 135 other American companies stilloperating there, according to the Washington-based InvestorResponsibility Research Center, a not-for-profit association fundedby institutional investors.   The oil giant said it was selling operations once valued at morethan $400 million to General Mining Union Corp. Ltd. for more than$155 million in cash plus $10 million that was expected to be theoperation's 1989 profit.   After adjustments for taxes and accounting, the company willrecord a net book loss of $140 million on the sale.   ``The rand has fallen a great deal over the last few years andthat has reduced the dollar value of the company in South Africa,''said Mobil spokesman John Lord. The loss will be included in thecompany's second-quarter earnings report, Lord said.   In a prepared statement earlier in the day, New York-based Mobilhad said the price exceeded Mobil's estimated present value of theSouth African operation's future earnings.   Mobil Chairman Allen E. Murray blamed U.S. foreign policies,including a 1987 law that eliminated certain tax credits for U.S.companies doing business in South Africa, ultimately forcing thepullout.   ``The law was ill conceived ... and had a serious economicimpact on us,'' Murray said.   The sale, expected to be concluded by June 30, includes arefinery and retail and commercial petroleum marketing networks.Twelve Mobil affiliates are involved in the sale, doing business inSouth Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Swaziland and Lesotho, Mobil said.   Mobil stock closed at $50.75 a share on the New York StockExchange, down 50 cents from Thursday's close.   ``This was a difficult decision because we continue to believethat our presence and our actions have contributed greatly toeconomic and social progress for non-whites in South Africa,''Murray said.   ``But we had to weigh business considerations including theimpact of recently enacted and proposed U.S. legislation andregulations which have made it more and more difficult for us to befully competitive there.''   Congress in late 1987 passed a bill by Rep. Charles B. Rangel,D-New York, eliminating a tax credit that allowed U.S. companies todeduct taxes paid to South Africa against taxes owed to the U.S.government.   Murray said that as a result of the change, earnings in SouthAfrica were taxed twice and the effective tax rate on South Africanearnings by U.S. corporations was 72 percent.   Mobil's 1988 profit was $2.1 billion on revenue of $54.9billion. Its foreign petroleum earnings totaled $1.2 billion, up 5percent from 1987.   Mobil had insisted since 1986 when Exxon Corp., the biggest U.S.oil company, left South Africa that it would not bow to pressure todisinvest. In the last four years more than 170 American firms havewithdrawn from that country because of South Africa's racepolicies. Most sold their operations at what were considered lowprices to South African-controlled business.   Two resolutions were to be presented by church groups at Mobil'sannual shareholders meeting in May asking the company to divest itsholdings in South Africa.   Mobil employed almost 2,800 people in South Africa and had beena symbol of foreign business reluctance to leave the country,despite widespread condemnation of the white-led government'ssuppression of the black majority in the system known as apartheid.   Nevertheless, Mobil has received a No. 1 rating in the last twoyears by a group that monitors U.S. companies' adherence to theso-called Sullivan Principles, a set of voluntaryanti-discrimination guidelines for companies doing business inSouth Africa.   Mobil's agreement with Gencor continues Mobil's equalopportunity policies and fund the Mobil Foundation at $3 million ayear at least until 1994. The foundation provides education,housing and other assistance, mostly to black South Africans.   The sale leaves Mobil, which does not export crude or productsto South Africa, without any holdings in South Africa, includinglicensing or franchise operations, Murray said.   Anti-apartheid groups cheered the move.   ``Mobil succumbed to anti-apartheid pressure,'' said DianeBratcher of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsiblity, anassociation of religious institutional investors that has targetedMobil since the 1970s.   ``Whether they'll say that or not ... that's why they areselling their assets.''   Mobil and other companies have maintained they are doing moregood by staying in South Africa, but anti-apartheid groups claimthe companies indirectly support racist policies.   ``So even though they are doing good in other areas they arepaying high taxes that are used to sustain apartheid,'' Bratchersaid.</TEXT></DOC>
