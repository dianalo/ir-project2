He said Hitachi Ltd., Toshiba Corp. and NEC Corp.of Japan and Samsung Group of South Korea should be able tostart shipping limited quantities of 16-megabit chips laterthis year. But he said he thought these companies would eachproduce just thousands of chips a month late this year,before getting to tens of thousands a month early next yearand then hundreds of thousands a month later in 1992. IBMapparently will be able to produce hundreds of thousands ofthe chips a month by late this year, on its way to millions amonth sometime in 1992.   While the chips themselves will provide only modestperformance gains in IBM products, memory-chip technologyalso bestows a broader advantage, which is why it is soclosely watched as an indicator of technology leadership.   The techniques developed to etch ever-tinier devices ontomemory chips help manufacturers improve the processors thatare the brains of their computers. So do the expensivetechniques that are used to make the manufacturing facilitiesever cleaner -- a necessity given that, as chips' circuitsshrink, even tinier specks of dust can kill a chip.   Mr. Attardo said, for instance, that IBM is using acutting-edge and controversial photolithographic device thatit developed with Perkin-Elmer Corp. over several years. Thedevice -- used to project light through a mask onto chipsmuch the way a photographer shines light through a negativeonto photographic paper -- had been criticized by somesemiconductor executives as too slow and expensive. Others,however, raised the alarm about international competitivenesswhen Perkin-Elmer decided to sell the business that made thedevice, and a Japanese company briefly appeared to show someinterest in it. IBM eventually brokered a deal in whichSilicon Valley Group bought the business from Perkin-Elmer,and Mr. Attardo said IBM's interest is finally paying off.   Mr. Attardo also said IBM had to develop a new type ofphotoresist, which is a chemical used in the etching of thecircuits onto the chips. Mr. Attardo said the so-called deepultraviolet photoresist increases the accuracy of the linesIBM draws on the chips, which can be half a micron wide, or1/200th the width of a human hair. By contrast, the lines ona four-megabit chip could be as wide as 0.8 micron.   Mr. Attardo said the wide availability of the new16-megabit chips inside IBM means they should start showingup in its computers next spring. IBM, which makes memorychips only for its own use, will have the 16-megabit chipswidely available inside products by the end of next year.   Besides generating the new production techniques, the newchips will help reduce the size of IBM products. That isbecause each fingernail-sized 16-megabit chip holds 16million bits of data, or roughly the contents of &quot;Crime andPunishment.&quot; That is four times the capacity of thefour-megabit chips that began showing up in products twoyears ago.   The new chips will also operate 20% faster than theirpredecessors. They will produce a bit of data in 50nanoseconds, or billionths of a second, compared with the 65nanoseconds required for an IBM four-megabit chip.   Given that there are so many other parts to a computer,the chip improvements will be diluted by the time they becomepart of a whole system. But no edge can be discounted at atime when IBM's earnings outlook is bleak and it is havingtrouble differentiating its products from those ofcompetitors.   IBM has licensed some of its memory-chip technology toother U.S. and European companies and consortiums to try tokeep Japanese companies from increasing their domination ofthe memory-chip market, and Mr. Attardo said IBM wouldconsider licensing the 16-megabit technology, too. IBMexecutives have, however, continued to say that the companydoesn't want to compete directly with the Japanese by sellingmemory chips to other companies. With new plants costing $500million apiece, the capital spending would be too high. Inaddition, price swings in the so-called merchantsemiconductor market can be so severe that IBM would preferto leave that business to others.
