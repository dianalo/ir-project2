Federal Home Loan Bank Board Chairman M. Danny Wall saidWednesday his agency would merge the 14 Sandamp;Ls into six largerinstitutions and begin efforts to sell them to private buyers witha meeting today with Oklahoma investors.   Through the sales, the agency hopes to get back some of itsassistance, which includes $1.2 billion in 10-year promissory notesand $700 million in guarantees against future losses.   In just two weeks, the agency has pledged nearly $10 billion torescue, in addition to the Oklahoma institutions, 21 in Texas, fivein Minnesota and one each in Iowa, Idaho, California and Tennessee.   Wall indicated the fast pace will continue over the next month.   ``We will be very active,'' he said.   He declined to provide details, but the agency's spokesman, KarlHoyle, said pending transactions in Texas and other states wouldinvolve billions of dollars more. The problem is greatest in theSouthwest, which has been hard hit by problems in the oil industry.   In part, the agency, which got a new board and an infusion ofcash last summer, is merely ``hitting its stride,'' Wall said, buthe acknowledged that the board felt pressured to act quickly by apending change in the way the federal budget deficit is calculated.   Although the bank board receives its money through an assessmenton the industry and not from the taxpayers, its spending countstoward the deficit.   Effective at the start of the 1989 fiscal year on Oct. 1,government accountants will count the bank board's promissory notesas immediate spending. Thus, any notes issued before Oct. 1 greatlyease the administration's budget-balancing burden.   The bank board was facing a deadline today to wrap upnegotiations with the Robert M. Bass Group of Fort Worth, Texas,which is seeking federal assistance to acquire American Savings andLoan Association of Stockton, Calif., one of the nation's largestSandamp;Ls.   The board began negotiating with the Bass Group exclusively onApril 21 and twice has extended the deadline. Wall promised anannouncement on American today but would not say whether the boardhad struck a deal or was planning to continue negotiations.   Industry sources have said between $1.5 billion and $2 billionin federal money likely will be required for that rescue, whichwould make it the largest bailout of a single Sandamp;L.   Including the Oklahoma package, regulators have closed or merged94 Sandamp;Ls so far this year, compared with 48 for all of last year.Wall said he planned to resolve the cases of 259 institutions thisyear and next.   Wall said three of Oklahoma's 48 Sandamp;Ls are attempting torestructure themselves with private capital, rather than governmenthelp, but if those efforts fail, they will be added to theconsolidation plan. The state's remaining 31 institutions arehealthy, he said.   Politicians and industry officials in Oklahoma are complainingthat the consolidation will make it difficult to keep theinstitutions in the hands of state residents.   ``If they lump them all into several huge packages, it's likelythey'll be sold to out-of-state investors because we're acapital-poor state,'' said Michael L. Toalson, president of theOklahoma League of Savings Institutions.   Oklahoma congressional offices made telephone calls Wednesdaymorning in an attempt to persuade the bank board to delay itsannouncement until after Congress returns from its Labor Day recess.   Joe Taylor, an aide to Rep. Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., said Inhofe andother Oklahoma members of Congress wanted a greater say in shapingthe plan.   ``We're concerned, very concerned, about the timing of thisthing,'' he said.   The chairman rejected that criticism, saying, ``Every day wewait ... the problem gets bigger. Our intention is to move asexpeditiously as possible.''
