McDonough, deputy IRMS commissioner.andP;  &quot;Agencies are clearlydoing a better job [of winning protests],&quot; he said.&quot;andM;But large settlements are still being paid.andP;  In March, the Navy agreed to paySystemhouse Federal Inc. of Arlington, Va., $190,000 for proposal andligitation costs in return for the company's withdrawing its protest of theNavy's Shipyard Technology Integration Project.andP;  Systemhouse had protestedthe award of the integration project contract to Hewlett-Packard Co. inJaniary, charging that the Navy improperly evaluated proposals.andP;  In February,the Navy agreed to rescore the proposals, but Systemhouse again protestedsaying the new evaluation was improper.andM;Under the agreement the argument, neither the Navy or Systemhouse admittedthe validity of the other's position and Systemhouse agreed to document itsclaim of $190,000 in costs.andM;Navy officials declined to comment on the settlement except to say the GSAreviewed the settlement and found nothing unusual about it.andM;Edward J. Hanley, director of the EPA's Office of IRM, said in his agencyagreed to the 1987 settlement because it could not afford any further delays.andO;The GSBCA had halted the procurement because of the protest.andM;&quot;Fedmail is not a big problem, and I do not agree with the characterizationof the government being taken to the cleaners,&quot; Hanley said.andP;  &quot;We paid itbecause we got a stupid ruling from the board.andP;  It was a cost-effectivedecision.andP;  It was worth it to us to avoid two more years of delay.&quot;andM;Since 1987 EPA has improved its ability to handle protests with betterdocumentation and better lawyers, Hanley said.andP;  He said agencies are now morefamiliar with the protest process and better prepared.andM;&quot;We [the government] now lose well because half of the cases.andP;  Vendors areless inclined to file suspicious claims, and if that's true the occassionsfor fedmail are fewer,&quot; Hanley said.andP;  &quot;We all have a better understanding.andO;The vendor community now raises its concerns in a more timely way, andthere's more communication in the early stages.andP;  We also present our casebetter.&quot;andM;According to statistics compiled by FEderal Sources Inc., a Vienna, Va.andO;consulting firm, the GSBCA issued 418 protest decisions from November 1986through April 1989.andP;  The company reported that in cases where the boardgranted or denied a protest, the government won 55.8 percent of the time inthe last half of 1988 and won about half the cases in the first half of thisyear.andP;  The numbers do not include cases where protests were dismissed.andM;Small Sample?andM;The IRMS ADP Protest Staff's quarterly report on agency protests issued inearly July said from the start of fiscal 1988 through the second quarter of1989, about 26.8 percent of agency protests were settled after a protest wasformally lodged with GSBCA.andP;  The report is not an official document, and GSAsaid the sample sizes were too small to draw any firm conclusions.andM;Nonetheless, during the second quarter of 1988, 33.3 percent of the protestswere settled, while 40 percent were settled in the third quarter and 29.4percent were settled during the fourth quarter.andM;This fiscal year, 30.8 percent of the protests were settled in the firstquarter while 18.2 percent were settled in the second.andM;In the cases where the board did not rule on the merits of the protests,about 29.5 percent of the cases were settled.andM;Concern over fedmail also may have declined because the GSBCA has reassertedits authority to review settlement agreements.andP;  The U.S.andP;  Court of Appealsfor the Federal Circuit in 1987 curbed the GSBCA's power to reviewsettlements when the board refused to dismiss the SMS protest after EPAagreed to the settlement.andM;The board recently ordered the Army to repay $20,986.13 it had agreed to payto Julie Research Laboratories Inc. of New York to settle a protest.andP;  Theboard also claimed the right to review settlement terms in cases where themoney would come from the permanent indefinite judgment fund.andP;  Someprocurement experts see this as way for the board to monitor settlements anddiscourage unnecessary claims.andM;However, the Justice Department has challenged the board's authority to orderpay backs.andM;Whatever the court's decision, procurement lawyers said the best way to stopfedmail is to ensure agencies are accountable for their procurementpractices.andM;&quot;The government needs accountability,&quot; said Joseph F. Petrillo, an attorneywith the Washington, D.C., firm of Petrillo andamp; Hordell.andP;  &quot;Why spend the money?andO;Who did it and how can you prevent it from happening in the future?andP;  That iswhat's lacking.&quot;andM;&quot;There are still some dim spots,&quot; said Phillips, an attorney with theWashington, D.C., firm of McGuire, Woods, Battle andamp; Boothe.andP;  &quot;One of thethings Congress had in its mind [when it established the GSBCA] was to decidethings openly and have the decisions published and learn from them.andP;  It's amatter of being better prepared and organized.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
