(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A California real estate agent testifiedMonday that PTL founder Jim Bakker sold a luxury home the month heresigned from the television ministry at a loss of at least $85,000.   Outside court, Bakker's wife, Tammy, appeared on the ``PhilDonahue Show,'' saying they never intended to misuse contributionsto PTL.   Emma Howard, a real estate agent from Palm Springs, Calif., saidBakker bought the Palm Desert home in 1984 for $450,000 and sold itin March 1987 for $385,000.   ``They lost at least $65,000 on the sales price plus closingcosts and real estate commission,'' she said. ``That added up to atleast $85,000.''   Ms. Howard was one of several witnesses called to testify atBakker's federal fraud and conspiracy trial about the Bakkers'spending habits.   Ms. Howard said she helped Bakker buy a $600,000 furnished homein Palm Springs in February 1987. She said he sold it in August 1987for the same price, losing a $36,000 real estate commission, $5,000for a new roof and closing costs of $3,000.   Bakker is charged with 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy andfaces 120 years and prison and more than $5 million in fines.Prosecutors say he used nearly $4 million in ministry funds tofinance a lavish lifestyle.   Others testified about renovations and decorating projects forthe Bakkers' home at Tega Cay, S.C., including Randy Utsey ofKitchens Unlimited in Charlotte, who said he did $43,155 worth ofremodeling and PTL paid the bill.   Builder and developer Haines Maxwell testified he did three majorprojects: a $25,592 garage and atrium addition, a $140,000renovation of the kitchen and dining room, and added a 15-by-18-footcloset to the master bedroom and a bedroom for the Bakker's son,Jamie, at a cost of $92,278. He said he was never paid for thebedroom work, but the rest was paid by PTL.   ``The Bakkers had a tendency to grow very bored with what theyhad,'' former PTL decorator James Taggart testified later. ``It wasnot unusual to see something completely replaced more than once.''   Taggart and his brother, David, were sentenced last week toprison and fined $500,000 each, convicted of evading taxes on nearly$1 million in PTL funds, including cash advances on ministry creditcards. James Taggart was sentenced to more than 17 years in prisonand David to more than 18 years.   James Taggart used enlarged photos of the Bakkers' homes to showthe jury how the Bakkers lived. The pictures included the Tega Cayparsonage, a Florida condominium and the presidential suite at theHeritage Grand Hotel.   Taggart described the extensive use of mirrors and marble in theBakkers' condo in Highland Beach, Fla. Every room had mirrors,including curved mirrors in the master bedroom and blue beveled-edgemirrors in the foyer.   ``Mr. Bakker's favorite color is blue,'' he testified. Later, hesaid, ``Here we are, still in the master bedroom. Here's acustom-made silk moire bed. This view is directly into the ocean.''   Taggart said he used a special hoist to bring seamless, 25-footcornices into the condo. He also installed $40,000 in draperies,bedspreads and headboards. Master bedroom draperies could be openedand closed with a switch.   Taggart decorated the condo for Christmas 1982 with a Christmastree that cost $5,000 and featured hand-blown glass ornaments.   At the lakefront parsonage, Mrs. Bakker had a 25-by-25-footcloset. A hot tub was installed at the parsonage, where earliertestimony showed the swimming pool was always heated to 90 degrees.   Taggart said the five-level parsonage underwent extensiveredecorating. The master bedroom was changed completely at leasttwice and the living room was redone three times, he said, includinga complete change of the brick on the fireplace.   Mrs. Bakker told television host Phil Donahue that accusationsabout her husband weren't true.   ``We know inside we are not guilty,'' she said in the interviewrecorded Friday and broadcast Monday. ``If I was guilty, I'd hide myhead, but when you're not guilty you're not guilty.''   Mrs. Bakker said PTL simply outgrew its founders.   ``It got to where it didn't even feel a part of us,'' she said.``We almost couldn't catch up with it. ... I felt like a little girlwho didn't know where she was supposed to be.''   If contributions intended for the ministry were misused, it wasnever by intent, she said.   ``The wonderful thing about God is he says you give and it shallbe given to you. I thought that was what was happening,'' she said.``I thought it was coming to us as a result of honoring his word.''   Mrs. Bakker said she was sorry if anyone was hurt and vowed tomake amends if they someday get another chance.   She said she might have become insensitive to others when moneyflooded the ministry.   ``There are times when you almost forget that $100 extra to spendto some people is all they have to spend,'' she said. ``I could gospend $100. I really forgot that some women can't do that.''   Other testimony about the Bakkers' spending habits came fromjeweler Ernest Perry of Charlotte, who said Bakker once bought araw, 12-carat diamond for $22,000.   Perry said Bakker told him the diamond would be ``a goodinvestment for his retirement.''   Carolyn Smith, of the Jerry Tuttle Insurance agency in Charlotte,testified the Bakker's homeowners policy valued their personalproperty at $134,000 for the period June 1, 1986, through June 1,1987. The policy covered such things as a $45,000 diamond ring, a$27,000 diamond ring, a $29,000 diamond bracelet, and the premiumwas paid by PTL.   Ms. Smith said the Bakker's also insured successively largerboats: an 18-footer in 1978 valued at $8,600, a 19-footer in 1984valued at $10,000, and a 22-footer valued at $29,000 in 1986.</TEXT></DOC>
