Taiwan companies that once believed Southeast Asianproduction could easily revive their declining globalcompetitiveness are learning hard lessons about labor unrestin the Philippines, clogged ports in Thailand and unreliablepartners in Indonesia. For some, China is proving to be anattractive alternative.</LP><TEXT>   While Taiwan investment in Southeast Asia continues toexpand, businessmen point to what they say is a growingdivergence in overseas investment strategies among Taiwancompanies.   On the one hand, many of the island's strugglinglabor-intensive industries that turned to Southeast Asia inrecent years are shifting more and more of their low-endproduction out of Taiwan -- and even Southeast Asia -- toChina. On the other hand, Taiwan's higher-technologyindustries are stepping up their investments in SoutheastAsia both to avoid rising costs back home and to be closer toan increasingly important market for their goods. Indeed, inthe past year such industries as computers, appliances andmachinery have turned Malaysia into the region's leading sitefor Taiwan investments.   The turn toward China by Taiwan's more labor-intensiveindustries is hardly surprising. They are lured by cheapwages, a huge pool of labor, a common language and Taipei'stacit acceptance of their presence in China. According toChinese data, total accumulated Taiwan investment in themainland was about $1.1 billion at the end of 1989, with anadditional $300 million to $400 million committed last year.Taiwan investments enter China indirectly throughthird-country subsidiaries because of Taipei's continuing banon direct investment.   The flow of investment to China is likely to acceleratelater this year, when Taipei is expected to formally end thestate of war with the communist government in Beijing. &quot;IfChina is not viewed as the enemy anymore, we will see moreinvestment there than Southeast Asia,&quot; says Calvin Wang, vicepresident of Investec (Taiwan) Ltd., a consulting firm.   Adds Philip Chen, secretary-general of the Taiwan TextileFederation: &quot;I see a decline in Southeast Asian investment.If there is an increase {in textile investment overseas}, itis people moving out of Taiwan and going to China.&quot;   Still, total Taiwan investment in Southeast Asia surpassesinvestments in China. Taiwan companies continue to pushoverseas to avoid high costs at home. Since 1987, the NewTaiwan dollar has appreciated more than 40% against the U.S.dollar. John Ni, director general of the Taiwan government'sIndustrial Development and Investment Center, estimates thatmore than 1,000 Taiwan-owned factories have been set up inSoutheast Asia since 1987.   Statistics compiled by Mr. Ni's office show that duringthe past three years, $8.19 billion of projects in Thailand,Malaysia, the Philippines and Indonesia involving Taiwaninterests was approved by the respective governments.According to the figures, $2.19 billion was approved in 1988,$2 billion in 1989 and $4 billion by early in the fourthquarter of 1990.   Businessmen say that in the face of such rapid expansion,a certain amount of disillusionment among Taiwan investors isnatural. &quot;A lot of chickens are coming home to roost,&quot; says astockbroker who watches Taiwan companies' Southeast Asianinvestments. For some companies, the problem was simply amatter of leaping before they looked. In the past, Taiwanbusinessmen's tendency to flock to a successful formula hasoften created problems for late-comers.   Martin Lee, president of Everate Group, one of Taiwan's 10largest footwear makers and managing director of the TaiwanFootwear Manufacturers Association, says his company set upan Indonesian factory three years ago, linking up withIndonesian partners. But after a while he began havingdifferences with his partners over the books. &quot;I lost a lotof money and shut down the factory,&quot; he says.   Thailand, once the darling of Taiwan investors, has becomea victim of its own popularity. Mr. Ni estimates that in thepast four years, labor-intensive and more-advanced Taiwancompanies have invested more than $2 billion in some 800projects in Thailand. Investments in Thailand involvingTaiwan interests in the first nine months of 1990 totaled$531 million, compared with $871 million in all of 1989.   The Philippines has attracted mostly small Taiwancompanies. According to the Taiwan Textile Federation, atleast 27 garment and textile factories have been set up inthe Philippines, the highest concentration of Taiwaninvestment in that industry in Southeast Asia.   Still, many Taiwan companies have become disillusionedwith the Philippines. Some textile factories have been hithard by labor unrest; others face low-level harassment byPhilippine bureaucrats. In the first 11 months of 1990,approved Taiwanese investments in the Philippines totaled$145.6 million vs. $148.7 million in 1989.   Malaysia, however, seems to be doing everything right.Taiwan companies have flocked there in the past year, nearlytripling their new investments in the country to $2.34billion through October 1990 from $815 million for all of1989.</TEXT></DOC>
