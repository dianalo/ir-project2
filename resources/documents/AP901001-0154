But he also suggested toBaghdad that an unconditional military withdrawal could help speedan end to the Arab-Israeli conflict.   Bush, in a speech before the U.N. General Assembly, said allnations hope that military force will not be required to drive Iraqfrom Kuwait. Yet, he won applause by vowing anew that Iraq'sannexation of Kuwait ``will not be allowed to stand.''   Praising the U.N.'s resolve, Bush said, ``This challenge is atest we cannot afford to fail. I am confident we will prevail.''   Even as Bush was speaking, the White House announced the UnitedStates was sending two batteries of Patriot air-defense missiles toIsrael on an emergency basis.   The weapons will help Israel defend against an increased threatfrom ballistic missiles in Iraq, presidential spokesman MarlinFitzwater said.   Nearly every seat in the General Assembly hall was full as Bushcombined a blistering indictment of Iraq with an overture forBaghdad to end the two-month old Persian Gulf crisis.   ``Iraq's unprovoked aggression is a throwback to another era, adark relic from a dark time,'' Bush said. ``It has plunderedKuwait, it has terrorized innocent civilians, it has held evendiplomats hostage.''   Aligning himself with remarks last week by Soviet ForeignMinister Eduard Shevardnadze, Bush said Iraq and its leaders ``mustbe held liable for these crimes of abuse and destruction.''   Bush met separately with Shevardnadze later to discuss the gulfcrisis, the plight of the Soviet economy and lagging arms controltalks. Emerging from the meeting, Bush said Shevardnadze was ``veryconfident'' that a treaty between NATO and the Warsaw Pact to cutU.S. and Soviet non-nuclear weapons would be ready for signing at a35-nation summit in Paris.   Bush said he was not as confident about completing a separateaccord with the Soviets to cut long-range nuclear missiles, bombersand submarines by 30 percent. Bush had hoped to sign that treatyduring a trip to Moscow in December but said Shevardnadze talkedabout completing the agreement early next year, if not by the endof 1990.   Shevardnadze praised Bush's speech as ``brilliant.''   Aside from his hard-edged rhetoric, Bush appeared to try toundercut Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's demand that histerritorial dispute with Kuwait be linked to Arab demands thatIsrael give up territory lost by Syria and Jordan in the 1967Mideast war.   Bush said that ``I truly believe there may be opportunities'' tosettle the Arab-Israeli conflict and to build ``new arrangements''among the states in the gulf - but only after Iraq makes anunconditional withdrawal from Kuwait.   Saddam has suggested he would pull his troops out if the Arabdispute with Israel is handled simultaneously.   The United States has long been committed to a Mideastsettlement in which Israel would exchange territory for Arabrecognition of its right to exist.   Bush said a military pullout by Saddam could clear the way forIraq and Kuwait to permanently settle their territorialdifferences.   ``And yet,'' Bush said, ``the world's key task - now, first andalways - must be to demonstrate that aggression will not betolerated or rewarded.''   Later, talking with reporters, Bush said his comment about``opportunities'' created by an Iraqi withdrawal did not mark anychange in policy and ``was not designed to convey flexibility orshift in position.''   He said he did not intend to suggest that Kuwait should make anyterritorial concessions. ``You've got to make whole Kuwait the wayit was.''   Bush also said it was possible that Saddam will make ``a180-degree turn'' and pull out of Kuwait.   However, the president said ``there would be great unease''about a simple return to the pre-invasion status quo if it leftSaddam with a ``very troublesome capability'' of military power.   ``The international community would have to have something tosay about that,'' Bush said. ``I'm sure that neighbors would wantto know that there was not a risk of another reckless invasion ofthis nature.''   In his speech, Bush did not mention his oft-stated demand thatthe exiled emir of Kuwait be restored to power. Yet, he toldreporters later that the ``restoration of Kuwait's leaders is aterribly important part'' of any settlement.   Bush assured Saddam that ``we seek no advantages for ourselves''in the gulf.   He said the 165,000 U.S. troops defending the oilfields of SaudiArabia were sent there at the request of the Saudi governmentfollowing Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.   ``The American people - and this president - want every singleAmerican soldier brought home as soon as the mission isaccomplished,'' he said.   Bush praised the Soviet Union for collaborating with the UnitedStates in a worldwide cutoff of trade with Iraq. The superpowers``had indeed put four decades of history behind us,'' he said.   More than ever before, Bush said, the United Nations is now ``acenter for international collective security.''   Bush has met with more than 20 leaders here over the past threedays, and he said he was encouraged by reports that Saddam ``isbeginning to understand that it is him against the world.''   Bush also said, ``There is more optimism in various quartersthat the sanctions are really beginning to bite hard.''   Even so, U.S. officials said Sunday the two superpowers, as wellas a number of other countries, had begun preliminary drafting ofresolutions to authorize the use of force against Iraq if Saddamdoes not withdraw his troops.</TEXT></DOC>
