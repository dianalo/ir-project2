(product introduction).andO;Ticker:    ADBE.andO;Product:   Apple Macintosh (Microcomputer) (computer programs)Type Manager (Printer software) (product introduction).andO;Topic:     WYSIWYGWord Processing SoftwareProduct Introduction.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Attention all Macintosh users! Do you think your word processors or desktoppublishing packages have been giving you WYSIWYG? Well, think again.andP;  You'vebeen getting what we like to call WYSIWYG-what you see is what you nearlyget.andM;The &quot;nearly&quot; applies because the Macintosh uses bit maps to display textcharacters on its screen.andP;  A particular Mac application, the Font/DA Mover,is used to install bit maps of particular fonts (Times, Helvetica, etc.) inparticular sizes (9, 10, 12 points, etc.) in the Mac's system file.andP;  When anapplication needs to put some text on the screen, it looks for a bit map ofthe particular font for that text.andM;So, suppose a user wants to use 12point Helvetica.andP;  If the bit map for thatparticular font and size has been installed in the Macintosh system, thenwhat the user sees on the screen will be a reasonable approximation of whatdie printer will print out.andP;  On the other hand, suppose the user wants to use13point Helvetica.andP;  Since very few (if any) fonts for the Mac have bit mapsfor 13point text, the Macintosh has to scale another bit map to create the 13-point screen image.andP;  There is certainly enough intelligence in the Macsystem for it to choose the easiest available size to scale to the desiredsize, but the results are certainly not WYSIWIYG.andM;BETTER THAN BIT MAP.andP;  There is a better way to get accurate font displaysthan by using bit maps: scalable or outline font technology.andP;  With this, aprogrammer can describe to the computer, mathematically, the shape of everycharacter in a particular font, Given the shape of any character and thedesired size, the computer can figure out how to display it.andP;  One example ofthis method is Adobe System's PostScript page-description language.andP;  Whentext is sent to a printer which uses the PostScript language, the printertakes the description of the shape (or outline) of the desired font alongwith the desired size and simply draws the text in the proper font and size.andM;Adobe has also introduced Display PostScript.andP;  It's the same language as thePostScript used by many printers, but with a driver that allows it to be usedto produce screen images as opposed to printing on paper.andP;  Steve Jobs's NeXTcomputer uses Display PostScript to run its monitor.andM;Soon, however, Mac users will be able to make use of similar display systems.andO;Adobe recently announced Adobe Type Manager (ATM), a product that will bringscalable font technology to the Macintosh.andP;  A few days later, Apple announcedthat, as pan of System 7 (see &quot;Apple Rolls a Seven&quot;), it will introduce itsown outline font technology for the Macintosh, These products approachdisplaying fonts on the screen in different ways.andM;ADOBE TYPE MANAGER.andP;  ATM will give to users of Adobe fonts outlinefonttechnology for their Macintosh screens.andP;  ATM uses the same technology asPostScript for creating images of text characters.andP;  (PostScript, however, cando much more than just produce text in a certain font and size.andP;  The languagecan also draw images, rotate text and images, produce gray scales, etc.) So auser who buys a font for the Macintosh from Adobe will get two files.andP;  Onefile is for PostScript printing devices and gives the outline of the font tothe printer for outputting hard copy.andP;  The other file will be for thedisplay.andP;  It provides the same outline, but in a format the Mac can use fordisplay purposes.andM;When an application needs to display an Adobe font on the screen, theapplication will call to the outline file, which will send back text of theproper font and size, shaped as correctly as the resolution of the screenallows.andM;When ATM is available (Adobe expects availability this fall), current ownersof Adobe fonts will be able to get ATM.andP;  ATM will, of course, ship with allAdobe fonts after it is available.andP;  Adobe wants to integrate this technologysmoothly (in as Mac-like a way as possible) into the Macintosh system.andP;  So auser should be able to use both Adobe and other (for instance, Apple) fontsin one document, For both the screen and printer, the program will send toATM for Adobe fonts and to the Mac system for Macintosh fonts.andP;  APPLE.andO;Apple's outline font technology, announced with System 7, will providesimilar high-quality display text for the Macintosh.andP;  Apple will use its ownmethod, different from ATM's, but will achieve similar results.andP;  A programthat needs any size Apple font will call to Apple's outline font system,which will send back the properly formed characters.andP;  This technology willnot only produce the characters a user sees on the screen, but also theoutput produced by non-PostScript devices.andP;  The Apple LaserWriter IISCproduces images with QuickDraw commands-the same commands that create what auser sees on the Mac screen.andP;  When the LaserWriter IIS C wants to print aparticular font and size, it will get the information it needs to draw thecharacters from Apple's outline fonts system.andM;Some third-pany font developers (such as Bitstream) have decided to supportApple's new font format, and Adobe has announced that it would provide ameans of convening Apple fonts to PostScript format.andP;  So Apple's new fontsshould be able to work with PostScript printers such as the Apple LaserWriterIINT.andM;WHAT DOES THIS MEAN? So Mac users will be able to get closer to WYSIWYGdisplays.andP;  That's good.andP;  Desktop publishers will be able to see moreaccurately on die screen what the final printout will look like withouthaving to print as many test hard copies.andP;  This is a nice technologicaladvance, but it's not going to change the industry.andM;There are other more interesting aspects to die introduction of outline fontsfor die Mac.andP;  Might there be compatibility problems or problems of prioritywith these fonts? Suppose a user can find an ATM and an Apple version of asingle font.andP;  (There are differences between the same font made by differentmanufacturers.) Will there be a problem using those two fonts? Will thesystem allow those two to be installed at the same time?andM;This is one, perhaps minor, point, but there are others that will show up asdevelopment goes along.andP;  ATM will be available this fall, and we expect itwin work properly with the cuffent Macintosh System 6.andP;  But the prospect ofSystem 7 coming in early 1990 is confusing.andP;  We know it's coming, but wedon't know enough about it to answer all of our questions.andM;APPLE AND POSTSCRIPT.andP;  Apple's high-end LaserWriters, the IINT and IINTX, areboth PostScript machines.andP;  Apple previously had heavily relied on PostScriptdevices for relatively lowcost, high-quality output.andP;  Low-end devices, suchas the LaserWriter IISC, Apple's ImageWriters and FaxModem, and others arecurrently limited by QuickDraw and bit-mapped fonts.andP;  It simply cannotproduce high-quality text at all font sizes, Once Apple outline fonts showup, that limitation should disappear.andP;  Apple seems to be declaring someindependence from PostScript (and, thus, Adobe) for its output.andM;Now, there is still the question of programs that produce PostScript output,such as Adobe Illustrator or Aldus FreeHand.andP;  These are important productsfor the Macintosh in its niche as a design and desktop publishing tool.andO;Obviously, they output best on PostScript devices.andP;  On other devices, thePostScript commands have to be translated into whatever commands the devicecan understand and then outputted.andM;Apple and the Macintosh rely too much on PostScript for Apple to becomecompletely independent of PostScript.andP;  It would seem that Apple simply wantsto be able to support other output methods as well as PostScript.andP;  That way,Apple can keep users who use PostScript devices happy while opening the doorto other developers.andM;A FEW LAST THOUGHTS.andP;  Apple's outline fonts and Adobe's PostScript are bothsystems that will be able to promote output device independence.andP;  That is,once the computer has figured out how to draw an &quot;H&quot; in Helvetica font at 12points, it should be able to output that &quot;H&quot; to a screen, a printer, a faxmachine, or any other device without having to refigure each time.andM;For Adobe, with ATM and PostScript, the same method is used to do thecalculations for text output on both the screen and the printer, but thereseems to be a distinct line drawn between producing text on screen or in aprinter.andP;  Apple's technology is more in the spirit of device independence:Programs looking for text for the screen and printers looking for text to puton a piece of paper will go to the same source; the system will take care ofthe differences.andM;If Apple's promises for System 7 come true, Apple font technology will getusers closer to WYSIWYG than they have been before.andP;  And Apple will beproviding a better solution to dealing with text on the screen and in aprinter than Mac users have had before.andP;  But Adobe is not out of theMacintosh text/ font picture.andP;  Both Apple and Adobe have similar good ideasabout unifying text across devices, and PostScript has a great deal of powerin the marketplace.andP;  Much depends on what System 7 brings.andP;  -D.andP;  Freeman</TEXT></DOC>
