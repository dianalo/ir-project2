There were no immediate reports of casualties. Kurds andU.N. officials said Iraqi troops were evicting thousands of Kurds fromvillages along the front separating Iraqi and Kurdish forces. That could makeit more difficult for Kurdish guerrillas to get shelter and supplies.;   KamalKhoshnavi, a spokesman for a rebel group, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan,said the Iraqi army had massed forces along the 250-mile front from Zakho toKhanaqin. Zakho is in the northwestern corner of Iraq close to the Turkishborder, 300 miles north of Baghdad, and Khanaqin is 95 miles northeast ofBaghdad on the Iranian border. The Kurds have maintained control north of theline since their failed uprising in March after Iraq's loss in the PersianGulf war.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  General News  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  IRAQ MASSES TROOPS, SHELLS THE KURDS  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Foreign News in Brief  </MEMO><BYLINE>  Mercury News Wire Service  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911118  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  November  </MONTH><PG.COL>  3F  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  159  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday, November 18, 199100323078,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
