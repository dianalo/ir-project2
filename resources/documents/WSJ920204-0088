Under U.S. District Judge Thomas F. Hogan's ruling,Pittston Co., A.T. Massey Coal Co.'s Rawl Coal subsidiary andPittsburgh andamp; Midway Coal Mining Co. are obligated to pay pastcontributions, plus interest and damages, into the funds.</LP><TEXT>   Coal companies like Pittston and Fluor Corp.'s Masseyargue that they shouldn't have to pay into the funds anymorebecause they are no longer parties to the basic coal-industrycontract with the United Mine Workers. Pittsburgh andamp; Midway, aunit of Chevron Corp., is a continuing signatory to thecontract for all but one of its coal operations.   Judge Hogan's decision requires companies that signed thenational bituminous coal wage agreement since 1978 to payretiree health benefits. &quot;No employer would want to be leftpaying for the benefits for retirees of other employers whodecided to skip out on their obligations,&quot; he wrote.   Along with possible payments by smaller, unionized coalcompanies currently paying reduced-rate premiums, more than$50 million could be due the funds under Judge Hogan's order,according to a coal-industry lawyer.   A Pittston spokesman said the company will &quot;vigorouslycontest&quot; the ruling. The company, based in Greenwich, Conn.,said its coal units face back-contribution costs of $6million to $10 million plus interest and damages, and $8million a year in future premiums. That would be on top of$17 million in retiree health and pension benefits thatPittston offered to pay into the funds after a 10-monthminers' strike that ended in January 1990.   The court ruling, besides helping to restore some money tothe trust funds, could influence a debate over a proposedcongressional bailout of the funds. Under a bill pushed bySen. John D. Rockefeller (D., W.Va.), all coal producerswould be taxed to help restore the funds and maintain them atadequate levels.   Coal concerns that belong to the Private Benefits Alliance-- companies that never signed UMW contracts and insist theyhave no obligation to help pay benefits for retirees of othercompanies -- oppose the legislation. Trustees for the fundshave said they will stop paying health benefits if legal orlegislative solutions aren't found.   Part of the funds' problem is that they must cover many&quot;orphan&quot; retirees or their spouses, whose former employersare out of the coal business. Last week, in a separate butrelated development, the funds' trustees sought court actionto require coal companies that are continuing signatories tothe UMW contract to remedy what the trustees allege areunderpayments.   The Private Benefits Alliance argued that Judge Hogan'sruling paves the way toward meeting the funds' deficits,making congressional action unnecessary. But the UMW and theBituminous Coal Operators Association, whose members arecurrent signatories to the UMW contracts, both said thedecision would have only limited value for the health andretirement funds. They both urged passage of the Rockefellerbill.</TEXT></DOC>
