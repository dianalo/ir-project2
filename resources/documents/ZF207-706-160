(ARC).andM;ARC, a market research and technology analysis company, predicted that themanufacturing software market will grow to $2.3 billion in 1994 from itscurrent level of $1.1 billion.andM;Through 1994, the annual growth rate will average 15.9 percent, peaking at 18percent in 1991, according to Andrew Chatha, ARC's president.andM;Applications software will make a splash simply because software and hardwaretools used to develop the software are getting better and cheaper, Chathasaid.andM;More software that better fits the needs of more companies will be making itsway to the shelves in the next few years.andP;  The increase in choices will inturn allow more companies to use package goods rather than more expensiveprograms that are customized or developed in-house, he said.andM;Currently, a &quot;major portion&quot; of application software &quot;is developed by theusers in-house or purchased on a custom basis,&quot; according to ARC research.andM;More powerful and more affordable tools, plus the dropping of hardwareprices, &quot;will make automation more affordable,&quot; Chatha said.andP;  Lower hardwareprices will also stimulate user demand and software development, he added.andM;Several other factors will also contribute to the growth of manufacturingsoftware, according to ARC research.andM;An increase in the user's experience level makes users feel more comfortablewith newer technologies.andP;  Firmer software standards means less confusion forusers choosing programs.andP;  An increase in software flexibility and incrementalintegration of software allows programs to be adopted over a wider variety ofapplications and hardware, according to the study.andM;An increasing trust in packaged software means that users will be more opento buying off the shelf as time goes on, and a greater acceptance ofstandardized hardware allows for uniform application platforms and easierprogram development, the study said.andM;In addition, there has been a jump in the number of software systemsintegrators and consultants, according to the study.andM;ARC research also noted that software vendors are showing an increasingwillingness to convert to OS/2 and Unix.andM;Despite the predicted proliferation of manuacturing software, ARC does notforecast a significant drop in software pricing.andP;  Instead, the software &quot;willbecome much more powerful,&quot; and offer more in terms of price/performance,Chatha said.andM;&quot;Users are looking for software which is much more powerful than what isavailable today.andP;  The industry will be able to give that to them,&quot; Chathasaid.andM;ARC's long-range forecast shows the software growth spurt slowing to lessthan 14 percent by 1994, although absolute dollar growth will remain strongthrough 1999, Chatha said.andP;  The dollar value of the goods will average ahigher growth rate when predicted price increases due to inflation are takeninto consideration, he added.andM;ARC's predictions are made with what is now a sluggish computer market inmind, Chatha said.andM;&quot;They take into account some slowdown the rest of the year and most of nextyear.andP;  Starting in the fall of next year, maybe we'll see the economy rampingup.andP;  We see the highest [manufacturing software] growth rate in '91 and '92,&quot;he said.andM;The increase in automation will also affect the number of manufacturingemployees needed in the computer market.andP;  &quot;It will require some retraining,&quot;he said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
