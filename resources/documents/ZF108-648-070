Itoh andamp; Co. Ltd. withdrew from the market.andP;  Even market leader WyseTechnology, crippled by its ailing personal computer business, found itnecessary  in 1990 to be acquired by  Taiwan-based investment group ChannelInternational to avert a financially bleak future.andP;  Other terminal makerssuch as Esprit Systems Inc. and TeleVedeo Systems Inc. continued to bathe inred ink,  with no rescuer on the horizon.andM;Industry giant IBM was not immune to the market slowdown; it also suffered adrop in its terminal shipments in 1989, despite setting substantially lowerprices for many of its models.andM;The market has changed.andP;  The display terminal market has matured, and growthcan be achieved only by focusing on markets tightly defined by eithergeography, application or both.andM;For terminal companies to be successful in the 1990s, they must embark onregionalized manufacturing and marketing strategies.andP;  Moreover, they mustaddress the display and communications requirements of distributed computing.andO;The winning display terminal products of the '90s will be X-Windowterminals-networked, local-processing displays-and alphanumeric terminalswith superior ergonomic and user friendly features.andM;A Storage Revolution?andM;The worldwide storage industry last year grew less than it had in theprevious year, with shipments of disk drives and other storage productsexpanding less than 30% in most market segments.andP;  But the business of makingdevices that store data was more profitable in 1989 than it was in 1988 formost suppliers.andM;Higher profitability is good news for users because it means storagesuppliers have greater resources to spend on developing products that will beneeded in the future.andM;Users may, in fact, be about to witness a revolution in storage technologywhereby the recording heads of disk drives actually ride on the surface of(rather than above or alongside) disk platters.andP;  Such a breakthrough willultimately offer disk drives at 20 cents per megabyte from the factory,compared with factory prices of around $2 per megabyte today.andM;Virtually every major segment of the storage industry is enjoying growth.andO;The worldwide market for rigid disk drives, popular storage devices forpersonal computer's  workstations, expanded 26% to $35 billion in 1989.andP;  Theglobal optical disk industry is still in its infancy at $1.1 billion butgrowing fast.andP;  Tape storage products, a $4.8 billion industry, have found abroader range of buyers and some newfound interest by major computercompanies.andM;The 5/4-inch hard disk market began its decline as the 372-inch drives gainedin popularity.andP;  First production shipments of new 272-inch diameter harddrives for notebook computers began in 1989.andP;  PrairieTek Corp., ConnerPeripherals Inc., JVC Corp. and start-up Areal Technology Inc. are makingthem.andP;  Demand for these tiny drives may expand to more than a million unitsin 1992.andP;  IBM even has shown pictures of a laboratory-produced disk drivethat is only 1.8 inches in diameter with 300MB of storage capacity.andM;Juke boxes are the new rage in optical disc technology.andP;  Despite the factthat they don't look anything like the old Wurlitzer in the malt shop of youryouth, these mechanical mazes offer many gigabytes of on-line capacity asfile servers or archival libraries.andP;  juke boxes are available for write-oncemagneto-optical, and compact disc read only memory (CD-ROM) optical discs.andM;Helical scan tape-recording technology, once confined to use in homevideocassette recorders, has ventured into the information systems world.andO;Several U.S.andP;  and European suppliers are incorporating Japanese-mademechanical-recording decks into their data storage subsystems.andP;  Both the 4millimeter digital audiotape decks and the 8mm Sony video decks are now beingused to store computer data on low-cost, pocket-sized cassettes.andM;Such innovation will continue to make storage one of the most interestingsegments of the electronics industry.andP;  But expect further consolidation amongsuppliers as the industry continues to mature.andP;  Industry giants like IBM andSeagate Technology will be joined by new storage conglomerates.andP;  ArchiveCorp., Conner Peripherals, HewlettPackard, Memorex Telex NV and Quantum Corp.andO;are suppliers that might reach the top of the storage elite by the end of thedecade.andM;Greg Blatnick is director of the display terminal industry service forDataquest Inc. in San Jose, Phil Devin is associate director of Dataquest'scomputer storage service, and Jim Upham is director of dataquest's printerservice.andM;The Big Events in Terminals in 1989andM;A maturing market shows signs of consolidation.andM;* Midrange systems suppliers get terminal illness.andM;* Lower terminal prices don't expand demand.andM;* Channel International (Taiwan) offers to buy Wyse Technology.andM;* Ampex discontinues its terminal business.andM;* X-terminals emerge as an important technology.andM;Source: Dataquest Inc.,andM;DATAMATION  The Big Events in Printers in 1989andM;IBM and HP square off;
