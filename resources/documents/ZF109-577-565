(The Complete Comdex Catalog 1990)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Welcher, David.andM;</AUTHOR><DESCRIPT/><TEXT>How to Get Around ComdexandM;Welcome to Comdex, billed as the computer industry's Main Event.andP;  Comdexsprawls across 10 locations all around the city of Las Vegas, and featuresmore than 1,700 exhibitors.andP;  The Sands Expo and Convention Center alonecovers over half a million square feet of exhibit space! Now that you'rehere, how do you make sure you get to see everything that's important todatabase professionals?andP;  This guide assumes you haven't rented a car (a smartmove) and gives you one insider's experience (mine).andM;I'll give you a list of survival essentials you should have at your disposal,as well as strategies for learning where the interesting exhibits are,planning your itinerary, how to cope with the avalanche of literature andsouvenirs you'll inevitably collect, and how to deal with getting it allhome.andM;Outfitting yourselfandM;Even before we talk about the show itself, let's prepare a &quot;personal survivalguide&quot;--what you'll need if you want to get through as comfortably aspossible.andM;Walking all those aisles can kill your feet.andP;  Think not?andP;  One of last year'smost popular exhibits featured licensed physical therapists giving footmassages!andP;  The lines were long.andP;  Experienced show visitors wear RockportPro-Walkers instead of regular business shoes.andP;  To avoid clashing too badlywith your Armani suit, buy your Rockports in Black.andP;  Also, despite the factthat it's November, the daytime weather is hot.andP;  Dress for summer, and bringa light jacket or sweater for the evenings.andP;  (You might want to remember anumbrella while you're at it, since deluges have hit the city more than onceduring past shows.)andM;While you're packing your kit, include a supply of aspirins, a few safetypins for those sewing emergencies (also useful for instantly repairing sewnluggage handles that have torn under the weight of your newly acquiredliterature collection), and maybe some Alka-Seltzer (the party scene is oneof the fringe benefits).andM;When making your reservation, consider renting a cellular phone.andP;  There cannever be enough pay phones for so many people.andP;  The average line (based on myattendance to several Comdexes) is four people.andP;  If it's shorter, peopleflock to it.andP;  If it's longer, people give up.andP;  All you queuing theory expertscan derive your own explanations, but a phone hanging from your belt willsolve this problem neatly.andM;Getting your bearingsandM;Most of the hotels and exhibit halls are clustered around Las Vegas Blvd.,andO;commonly known as &quot;The Strip.&quot;andP;  Shuttle buses run all day, visiting all ofthe exhibit halls and all of the official hotels (those listed in theregistration guide).andP;  You can ride free of charge--schedules are posted.andM;Over 110,000 people attended last year's show, so many exhibits will becrowded.andP;  Plan to come with a friend, if possible, so you can divide up theexhibit visits.andP;  More on this later.andM;You can prepare for the experience before you get to Las Vegas.andP;  Everyone whoregisters receives a tabloid newspaper called the Comdex Preview severalweeks before the show.andP;  This lists all of the confirmed exhibitors, theirbooth numbers (some will inevitably change), as well as maps of the city andthe exhibit halls, and indexes by vendor name and category.andP;  This is yourfirst opportunity to get organized.andP;  Second, refer to this special section ofData Based Advisor.andP;  Many of the companies announcing their Comdex news herewill also be at the show, so tag the products you want to know more about.andM;Mapping out your routeandM;When deciding what you'd like to see, consider your role as a databaseprofessional.andP;  You don't just write software, you provide total informationsolutions for your clients.andP;  So your expertise must cover a lot more thanjust the database manager of your preference.andP;  Besides, just how manyFoxPros, dBASEs, Paradoxes, and Clippers are out there?andP;  If that was all youneeded, you could do Comdex in about three hours.andM;Consider how data's collected, how it's managed, how's it's manipulated andreiterated, and how it's finally presented.andM;For data collection, you'll want to look at bar code scanners, opticalreaders, IEEE remote interfaces, serial devices, touch screens, and whateverelse pops up at the show.andP;  One of Comdex Spring's most interesting deviceswas a laser device that could transmit local area network data over largedistances without wires.andP;  It costs over $11,000 a pair, but what if yourclient's two building are separated by a river.andP;  Want to run network cablesunderwater?andM;For manipulation, there are the latest 486 speed demons, innovativeportables, hand-held DOS machines, and a variety of networkable device.andM;Software tools should include not only the latest releases of your favoritedatabase manger, but editors, report writers, free-form data managementtools, and network schedules, among others.andP;  Put yourself in your client'sshoes, and you'll watch your list explode.andM;When you present data, all your expertise finally sees the light of day.andO;You'll want it to look as perfect as possible.andP;  Did you know there are lasertypesetters that can do 1,000 dots per inch?andP;  (The standard laser does only300.)andP;  How about a laser printer that runs pin-feed paper and can do 16 pagesper minute instead of the usual eight?andP;  One of the newest technologies letsyou present moving video images in the middle of the computer's screen amidstthe data.andP;  Could any of your clients use that?andM;Setting the scheduleandM;Now that we've broadened our horizons and know what we want to look at, howdo we manage to do it in just five days?andM;Before you get there, select the relevant exhibits from the Preview Guide.andO;After you've arrived, the large exhibit catalog will flesh out yourinformation.andP;  You should also get a Comdex Daily, another edition of thenewspaper, everyday.andP;  Peruse it quickly at the start of each day for any newthings of interest, as well as any booth changes.andM;A lot of the serious business at Comdex takes place away from the exhibitfloor.andP;  Your Preview Guide will give you phone numbers for vendors so you cancall to make appointments before you get to Las Vegas.andP;  If you represent apotentially large purchase, you'll find them especially receptive.andP;  This notonly ensures that you'll find out what you need to know, but that you'll alsotalk to the right person in the company.andM;Another little known fact is that many vendors have telephones in theirbooths.andP;  You can get the numbers from the Comdex office at the show.andP;  If youabsolutely can't get to a particular exhibit, call and ask them to send youinformation.andM;Packing your gearandM;Early on, find an attractive shopping bag that looks strong enough to survive10 pounds of literature.andP;  Collect five or six of these and put them in thefirst bag.andP;  Later in the week, when the bags are out of stock, you'll haveinstant replacements for the ones whose handles have torn off or bottomedout.andP;  Putting one bag inside the other will also extend its life.andP;  Fourhandles are better than two.andM;Choosing a SherpaandM;An ideal strategy for visiting exhibits revolves around reducing the load.andO;As I said before, if you can, bring a friend and divide up theresponsibilities.andP;  Each of you should visit a portion of the exhibits,arranged in advance.andP;  After each day, compare notes.andP;  Send your colleague tothe must-see stuff you've uncovered.andP;  He or she will do the same for you.andO;Spend some time together, as well; it can get lonely being surrounded by110,000 strangers--although you will, of course, meet other people you know.andM;Once you've made up your list, divide it into must-sees andwould-be-nice-if-I-have-the-times.andP;  Make a separate list for each of the 10exhibit halls.andP;  Put down the booth number, the company name, and a one-linedescription of what it's all about.andP;  If you don't, by the time you've entered50 of these, you'll have a hard time remembering who the players are.andP;  (&quot;Youcan't tell the players without a scorecard,&quot; right?)andM;Sight-seeingandM;While you're negotiating the aisles of the various halls, keep an eye out forany interesting stuff along the way.andP;  If you can't stop then, make a note tocome back later on.andP;  Be especially alert for the booths along the walls andin the corners of the rooms.andP;  Major exhibitors like Microsoft and IBM getcenter-stage locations, and newcomers are tucked in wherever they can getspace.andP;  You'll discover many of the most innovative and exciting products inthese peripheral (pun intended) locations.andP;  They'll often become thecommonplace items of next year or the year after.andP;  Discovering them now cangive you and your clients a competitive edge.andM;Besides, some of the gadgets are just plain fun.andP;  One vendor of customkeyboard labels was giving out &quot;ANY KEY&quot; stickers for your client's spacebar.andO;Now, when the screen says, &quot;Press Any Key to Continue&quot; your newlycomputer-literate client won't have to call you complaining that they can'tfind the &quot;Any&quot; key.andM;Following your compassandM;By all means, select your exhibit sequence carefully.andP;  Everyone will starttheir investigations at the Las Vegas Convention Center, since that's whereyou register and pick up your badge and other materials.andP;  The most outlyingarea is Cashman Center.andP;  Immediately get on the shuttle bus and go there.andO;You won't quite have the place to yourself, but it'll be a lot emptier.andM;Also, scheduled hours depend on the building in question.andP;  The ConventionCenter and its adjoining West Hall open Monday at 10:30, other days 10:00,and stay open until 5:00.andP;  All the other sites open Monday at 9:00, otherdays 8:30.andP;  They stay open until 6:00.andP;  On Friday, everything closes at 4:00.andO;When you visit the Convention Center, you can leave at 5:00 and walk oneblock to the Hilton.andP;  Other sites are a bit farther away.andP;  By the way, allclosing times, especially in the Convention Center and West Hall, arereligiously observed.andP;  Like the proverbial factory whistle, the closing isannounced, and the place shuts down.andP;  Accordingly, booths start packing up by4:45.andP;  Plan your visits with this in mind.andM;Picking up souvenirsandM;At the various booths, take only what you must.andP;  Standard product literaturefrom major vendors will be sent in the mail--you won't have to lug it home.andO;If the item is from one of the smaller vendors along the edges of the room,take the literature then and there.andP;  They may not be as efficient in mailing,since they might not have a dedicated mailing department like the biggerguys.andP;  Exceptions to this rule are technical guides from major vendors, likeSeagate's Disk Drive Specifications book, or PC Magazine's catalog of alldownloadable software, which may be difficult to acquire later.andP;  If youabsolutely must have it, take it when you find it.andM;Meeting the localsandM;More important still are the business cards you collect.andP;  These are peoplewho can quickly help you cut through red tape to get a technical problemsolved.andP;  Write on the back of each card (this is the most important rule Ican offer) exactly what the person does and why you were interested infurther contact.andP;  Otherwise, after you collect 100 of these, you'll never beable to figure it out.andP;  When you pack to go home, put all these cards in yourcarry-on bag, and not in your checked baggage.andP;  They're much too valuable torisk losing them.andP;  Back at your office, put them in permanent file (or in adatabase, you are a database professional, remember?)andP;  Also keep the showdirectory.andP;  You'll find uses for it all year long.andM;Don't forget to allow some time for seeing the city.andP;  Not known for beingconservative, Las Vegas hotels are in a continual contest for the greatestexcess and extravagance.andP;  You don't have to gamble to experience this.andP;  Takenote of the Centurion on duty in front of Caesars Palace; walk through it andsee Cleopatra's barge in one of the corridors; go to the Mirage and watch thevolcano erupt every hour on schedule; visit the second floor of Circus Circusand watch the trapeze artists or try to win a teddy bear.andM;Getting home againandM;What do you do with all of the literature you've collected?andP;  Spend a fewminutes every night sorting out the useful from the ridiculous.andP;  Toss outanything you never want to read again, and try to organize the rest into someof those shopping bags you collected the first day.andP;  Allow an hour on thelast day to finalize this, along with your packing.andP;  Get to the airport alittle bit early.andP;  The gates in Las Vegas are a fair distance from theterminal.andP;  Ask the baggage agent for a cardboard baggage box.andP;  Put all yourshopping bags into the box and check it through to your final destination.andO;Now you can get on the plane without looking like a Comdex nerd.andP;  Your newlyacquired literature collection will be waiting for you when you get off theplane.andM;Congratulations.andP;  You've survived Comdex (not everyone can say that).andP;  Nowthat you're a veteran, teach your friends these tricks.andP;  They'll look at youwith new-found respect.andP;  See you there.andM;David Welcher is head of Computing Dynamics Ltd., a Brooklyn-based managementconsulting and software development firm.andP;  The company specializes in Clipperapplications.andP;
