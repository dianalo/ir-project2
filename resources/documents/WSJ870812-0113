In an agreement with the company, the Environmental Protection Agency dropped plans to begin hearings aimed at banning Velsicol's products containing chlordane and heptachlor. The EPA also stopped short of placing any new restrictions on stocks that Velsicol already has sold for use by exterminators.    Donna Jenkins, public affairs manager for the closely held Rosemont, Ill.-based chemical maker, said Velsicol expects to resume sales of products with the two chemicals in about nine months. She said it would take that long for the company to complete the initial phase of testing. The products' trade names are Gold Crest, C100 and Termide.    But some EPA staff members doubted that Velsicol can demonstrate the level of safety that it agreed to set as the prerequisite for resuming sales.    While Velsicol refused to disclose its sales of the two chemicals, the EPA estimated the figure at about $30 million a year, or more than 60% of all U.S. sales of termite-control chemicals. Best positioned to fill the vaccuum is Dow Chemical Co., Midland, Mich. Dow's product, Dursban, is toxic, but doesn't appear to present any cancer risk, according to the agency. EPA officials said it currently accounts for about 25% of U.S. sales of termite-control chemicals.    In its agreement with the EPA, Velsicol said it will withhold further sales until tests on at least 150 homes demonstrate that certain external application techniques can prevent any detectable level of the chemicals from contaminating the inside of treated homes for between four months and two years. If the test results allow sales of the compounds to resume, the agreement allows the EPA to prohibit permanently certain application techniques believed to cause interior contamination.    The announcement surprised environmentalist critics of the EPA who had expected the agency to launch a lengthy regulatory process before concluding what to do about the chemicals. Generally, environmentalists continued to call for an emergency ban on all use of the chemicals.    Diane Baxter, a toxicologist for the National Coalition Against the Misuse of Pesticides, said she was &quot;delighted&quot; that the chemicals' sale was stopping, but &quot;very disturbed&quot; that the EPA was allowing continued use of existing stocks. She warned that even if home interiors were spared, the persistence of the chemicals would cause them to continue contaminating streams and rivers.    Steven Schatzow, a lawyer for Velsicol, said the company agreed to the pact because it was &quot;getting killed in the marketplace.&quot; Publicity about the chemicals' hazards, he said, already has cost Velsicol &quot;most of our big customers.&quot;    The EPA said the chemicals probably cause human cancer at a rate of as much as one case in 10,000 persons exposed for a lifetime. It banned the two chemicals from agricultural uses in 1978, but allowed their continued use as home termiticides because it believed that there were no adequate substitutes, and that proper use would prevent contamination of home interiors.    Besides Dursban, four alternatives for termite control are being marketed by Dow; FMC Corp., Chicago; the ICI Americas Inc. unit of Britain's Imperial Chemical Industries PLC; and the Mobay Corp. unit of Bayer AG of West Germany. </TEXT></DOC>
