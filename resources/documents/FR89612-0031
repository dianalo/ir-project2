The assessment provides a basisfor the conclusion that the field testing of these genetically engineeredpotato plants will not present a risk of introduction or disseminationof a plant pest and will not have any significant impact on the qualityof the human environment. Based upon this finding of no significant impact,the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that an environmentalimpact statement need not be prepared.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Copies of the environmental assessment and finding ofno significant impact are available for public inspection at Biotechnology,Biologics, and Environmental Protection, Animal and Plant Health InspectionService, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Room 850, Federal Building, 6505Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Dr. James White, Biotechnologist,Biotechnology Permit Unit, Biotechnology, Biologics, and EnvironmentalProtection, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, U.S. Departmentof Agriculture, Room 844, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville,MD 20782, (301) 436-7612.

A permit must be obtained before a regulated article can beintroduced in the United States. The regulations set forth procedures forobtaining a limited permit for the importation or interstate movement ofa regulated article and for obtaining a permit for the release into theenvironment of regulated article. The Animal and Plant Health InspectionService (APHIS) has stated that it would prepare an environmental assessmentand, when necessary, an environmental impact statement before issuing apermit for the release into the environment of a regulated article (see52 FR 22906).Monsanto Agricultural Company, of St. Louis, Missouri, has submitted anapplication for a permit for release into the environment, to field testpotato plants genetically engineered to express the coat protein genesof potato virus X and potato virus Y.In the course of reviewing the permit application, APHIS assessed the impacton the environment of releasing the potato plant under the conditions describedin the Monsanto Agricultural Company application. APHIS concluded thatthe field testing will not present a risk of plant pest introduction ordissemination and will not have any significant impact on the quality ofthe human environment.The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact, whichare based on data submitted by Monsanto Agricultural Company, as well asa review of other relevant literature, provide the public with documentationof APHIS' review and analysis of the environmental impacts associated withconducting the field testing.The facts supporting APHIS' finding of no significant impact are summarizedbelow and are contained in the environmental assessment.1. Genes encoding the viral coat proteins of potato virus X and potatovirus Y have been inserted into the potato chromosome. In nature, chromosomalgenetic material of these plants can only be transferred to other sexuallycompatible plants by cross-pollination. In this field trial, the introducedgene cannot spread to other plants by cross-pollination because the potatoplants are male sterile.2. Neither the viral coat protein genes themselves, nor their gene products,confer on potato any plant pest characteristics. Traits that lead to weedinessin plants are polygenic traits and cannot be conferred by adding a singlegene. 3. The expression of the viral coat protein genes does not provide thetransformed potato plants with any measurable selective advantage overnontransformed potato plants in their ability to be disseminated or tobecome established in the environment.4. The vector used to transfer the plant viral genes to the potato plantshas been evaluated for its use in this specific experiment and althoughderived from a DNA sequence with known plant pest potential, has been disarmed;that is, genes that are necessary for producing plant disease have beenremoved from the vector. The vector has been tested and shown to be nonpathogenicto any susceptible plant.5. The vector agent, the bacterium that was used to deliver the vectorDNA and the plant viral coat protein genes into the plant cell, has beenshown to be eliminated and no longer associated with the transformed potatoplants. 6. Horizontal movement of the introduced gene is not possible. The vectoracts by delivering the gene to the plant genome (i.e., chromosomal DNA).The vector does not survive in the plants.7. The field test site is small (less than 0.5 acre) and is physicallyisolated by a surrounding area of cultivated land.The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact havebeen prepared in accordance with: (1) The National Environmental PolicyAct of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4331 <T3>et seq.</T3>), (2) Regulations of the Council on Environmental Qualityfor Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (40 CFR Parts 1500-1509),(3) USDA Regulations Implementing NEPA (7 CFR Part 1b), and (4) APHIS GuidelinesImplementing NEPA (44 FR 50381-50384, August 28, 1979, and 44 FR 51272-51274,August 31, 1979).<ITAG tagnum="21">Done in Washington, DC., this 6th day of June 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James W.
