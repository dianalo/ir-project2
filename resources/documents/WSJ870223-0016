Its rapid growth, fueled by no-bid defense contracts available to a minority-controlled business, turned it into a highflier on the New York Stock Exchange.    But late last year, the company collapsed. And now the company is entangled in a scandal involving political payoffs that Wedtech officials admit they made to get those contracts.    Wedtech lost its status as a minority business early last year. As government contracts began petering out during the year, federal and state investigators began looking into the political payoffs. The company's profits and stock price plummeted and, in December, it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection from creditors.    Earlier this month, four Wedtech officials pleaded guilty to a scheme that inflated the company's earnings through false invoices and flagrant accounting gimmicks, as well as to bribing officials. Law enforcement officials say more indictments will follow.    Wall Street analysts and thousands of investors in more than $160 million of Wedtech's stock and bonds are puzzled and upset about Wedtech. A major question being asked is how did Wedtech fool so many people for four years about its earnings?    They wonder how Wedtech's books could have received clean bills of health from the time the company went public in late 1983, since subsequent investigations have shown that earnings were being inflated.    Financial analysts and accountants say Wedtech was able to accomplish this by adopting an extremely complex profit-booking technique known as &quot;percentage-of-completion&quot; accounting, which can lend itself to questionable financial reporting when abused by company management.    The scheme to which the four officials pleaded guilty involved issuing false financial statements, law enforcement officials say. According to Thornton O'glove, publisher of the Quality of Earnings Report for institutional investors, the company pumped up its earnings by overstating work expected from the government that apparently never materialized.    &quot;Wedtech became skilled at using 'ghost' accounting to create earnings that didn't exist,&quot; Mr. O'glove says. &quot;When revenues dropped sharply last year, the company just couldn't scramble fast enough to cover up the empty holes that surfaced from previous years.&quot;    Wedtech got a lot of help in disguising earnings from a former member of its previous outside auditing firm, KMG Main Hurdman. Anthony Guariglia, who left KMG in mid-1983 after working on the Wedtech audit, later became Wedtech's president. Earlier this month, Mr. Guariglia pleaded guilty to bribing government officials and to defrauding Wedtech shareholders through falsifying financial statements, thereby inflating profits.    Another KMG partner with close ties to Wedtech was Richard Bluestine, who was in charge of Wedtech's audit in 1983. Mr. Bluestine left KMG to join Wedtech in September of that year. The Manhattan district attorney's office says Mr. Bluestine, before leaving KMG, allegedly agreed to receive $1.5 million in Wedtech stock and a $900,000 loan from Wedtech. The district attorney's office has said it is probing whether Mr. Bluestine was truly independent of Wedtech when he audited its books. Mr. Bluestine, who declines to comment, hasn't been charged with any crime.    Ten civil suits have been filed against former Wedtech officials. Seven of them are also directed against KMG and allege fraud in the accountant's failure to discover the false invoices and the bribes, which KMG denies. Five suits are against Wedtech's underwriters, Bear, Stearns andamp; Co. and Moseley Securities Corp., which allege that the securities firms, in selling Wedtech securities, misled investors about Wedtech's financial results. Bear Stearns denies the allegations and Moseley won't comment.    But how did Wedtech manage to avert the scrutiny of Wall Street financial analysts for so long? Its stock jumped to $24 (equivalent to $16 after a 3-for-2 split in September 1985) in the over-the-counter market early in 1984, from only $16 when it went public 15 months earlier. And although at least $25 million of its profits were created through fancy accounting gimmickry since 1981, the company wasn't forced to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection until last December.    First, to get sales dollars flowing into its coffers, Wedtech had to get favored treatment as a government contractor. The modus operandi was simple and dishonest, law enforcement officials say. Claiming that its founder, John Mariotta, a Hispanic, controlled the company, Wedtech qualified for special &quot;small business status.&quot; This enabled it to get favored government business without bidding.    Actually, after Wedtech went public in August 1983, Mr. Mariotta no longer controlled the company. &quot;He simply had an option to buy stock that would bring him up to 51% control if he exercised it,&quot; says an accountant who has scrutinized Wedtech's books and management files. &quot;But other company officials had the contractual right to fire him if he tried to exercise it.&quot;    Then, accounting gimmickry became the keystone of the company's scheme to falsify earnings, according to law enforcement authorities. Wedtech, as a defense contractor -- it sold bridge supports, small motors and spare parts to the military -- was able to use &quot;percentage-of-completion&quot; accounting. Such accounting, used legitimately by many firms, permitted it to record earnings based on its current costs, the estimated costs to complete a project and whether it believed the entire contract price would be received by the company.    For example, say Wedtech was making 10,000 bridge pontoons for the Army over three years at a cost of $100 million in material and labor and was charging the Army $110 million for all the supports, making a $10 million, or 10%, profit. If its costs in the first year were $25 million, under percentage of completion it would record a profit of $2.5 million, or 10% of its costs.    In the contract's second year, if Wedtech spent $50 million, it would record $5 million in profit. This would leave $25 million in costs and a profit of $2.5 million for the third year of the contract.    Law enforcement officials and accountants say Wedtech was improperly accelerating its contract receipts and recognizing profits it never received.    If the Army, for example, later decided that it only wanted a total $50 million of the bridge supports, Wedtech would only be able to record profits of $2.5 million the first year, $2.5 million the second year and none the third year. That's a total of only $5 million, or half the previous total. But, in this hypothetical example, Wedtech would have booked the entire $10 million.    The company actually should have been using &quot;completed-contract&quot; accounting because it wasn't certain that it would get the entire amount in a contract, Mr. O'glove says. Under this accounting method, Wedtech wouldn't have been able to record any profit until the end of the three years in the contract.    Law enforcement officials say that the falsified invoices that Wedtech officials admitted using in seeking reimbursements from the government totaled $4.7 million during 1981 and 1982. This, in part, explains why a prospectus for Wedtech's $30.4 million equity issue in late 1983 shows a jump in receivables to $12.8 million at the end of 1982 and to $15.6 million as of April 30, 1983, from only $2.8 million in 1981.    In its financial report for 1984, Wedtech listed net income of $4.7 million. In fact, say law enforcement officials, this profit included portions of a $20 million contract to supply cooling and suspension kits for Army vehicles in West Germany. Law enforcement officials say that Wedtech never got this contract.    How did Wedtech's auditors, KMG, miss this overstatement?    KMG notes that when it turned up falsified invoices on Wedtech's books in 1983, it informed the company and its outside attorneys, Biaggi andamp; Ehrlich, who said the matter had been referred to government regulators and assured KMG the irregularities wouldn't recur. (Earlier this month, Bernard C. Ehrlich, a partner in the law firm, was indicted in a state court in Manhattan on charges of bribing a state official on behalf of Wedtech. He pleaded innocent. The other partner in the law firm, Richard Biaggi, who hasn't been charged with any crime, is the son of U.S. Rep. Mario Biaggi.)    KMG says that in 1983 it followed &quot;extended&quot; audit procedures and was satisfied that any irregularities had been stopped.    As to the 1984 report, a KMG spokesman says that recent guilty pleas by the Wedtech officials to bribery and business fraud indicate that &quot;pervasive fraud&quot; permeated former Wedtech management.    &quot;We took tough positions with Wedtech in auditing and accounting issues, which ultimately led to our dismissal&quot; in mid-1985, says John A. Thompson, KMG's chairman and chief executive. KMG declined further comment because of the civil litigation against it filed by Wedtech shareholders.    After KMG was replaced as auditor in mid-1985, the new auditor, Touche Ross andamp; Co., gave Wedtech's 1985 financial statement -- reporting net of $9.7 million, or more than double a year earlier -- a clean opinion.    Touche Ross officials say they relied somewhat for their clean opinion on Wedtech's 1985 financial report on auditing work that KMG had done in the early part of that year. &quot;KMG assured us there was no reason to doubt the integrity of Wedtech's management,&quot; says Richard Murray, Touche's general counsel.    By the time Wedtech's stock moved to the New York Stock Exchange in January 1986, its price had spurted upward 50% to $24.    Early in 1986, about the time that Wedtech lost its minority-business status -- spelling an end to its no-bid contract privilege, Wedtech's founder, Mr. Mariotta, was forced out of the company. Law enforcement officials say he and another Wedtech executive, Fred Neuberger, who recently pleaded guilty to payoffs of government officials and business fraud, would throw cups of coffee and chairs at each other during hectic Wedtech board meetings late in 1984 and early 1985.    Phone messages left at the homes of Messrs. Mariotta and Neuberger weren't returned.    Last August Wedtech floated a $75 million issue of 14% junk bonds just as reports about its influence peddling began to surface.    After the federal government last year withdrew a sizable number of military contracts from Wedtech, the company had to fire most of its 1,400 workers, reducing its work force to under 200. In mid-December, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection from creditors.    After Wedtech's business began to fall apart, Touche Ross withdrew as its auditor but, in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, it noted that the company's losses as of last Sept. 30 were at least $90 million and that Wedtech had a negative net worth (assets minus liabilities) then of $30 million.    As for the bribery scheme, federal and local law enforcement officials are investigating whether Wedtech used political connections to such local politicians as Bronx Borough President Stanley Simon and U.S. Reps. Robert Garcia and Biaggi, Bronx Democrats, to obtain government business. The politicians, who haven't been charged with any crimes, deny any wrongdoing.    Manhattan and Bronx district attorneys and the U.S. attorney here are investigating fees paid by Wedtech to politicians. They say more indictments will follow.    Wedtech's current president, Joseph Felter, a retired U.S. Army colonel who was brought in by the company's creditors, says Wedtech plans to rehire about 30 employees because a few new Army contracts are beginning to filter in. Following the receipt of these new government contracts, Wedtech's stock price, which had gone as low as 25 cents, in recent weeks underwent a run-up. It reached a high of $1.75 a share Friday before closing at $1.50.    Laventhol andamp; Horwath, Wedtech's new auditor, is trying to put the company's financial records back together again, and another auditor, Arthur Young andamp; Co., is going over its books as a representative of the creditors.    &quot;We're scrubbing the company from top to bottom and are restoring proper accounting systems,&quot; says Mr. Felter. &quot;What happened in the past here was incredible, but we want to restore credibility. We have to in order to survive.&quot;    Harry Tavitian, Wedtech's current controller, adds: &quot;We trusted former management and they let this company go down the drain. It really hurts because we have a lot of potential.&quot;    ---   Wedtech Corp.
