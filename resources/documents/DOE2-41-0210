Some types of radiation source, however, do not need tobe subject to regulatory control, because they present such a low hazardthat it would be a needless waste of time and effort to exercise controlby a regulatory process and they can therefore be exempted from it. AnAdvisory Group Meeting was convened in Vienna in March 1988 sponsoredjointly by the IAEA and NEA. This Safety Guide is the result of thatmeeting and represents a first international consensus on the subjectof exemption principles. This document is issued as an IAEA Safety Guidesince it recommends a procedure which might be followed in implementingthe Basic Safety Standards (BSS) for Radiation Protection. Its purposeis to recommend a policy on exemptions from the BSS system of notification,registration and licensing. 15 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
