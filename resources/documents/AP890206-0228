HIDLAY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Mysterious holes that periodically form in theice covering Antarctic seas may serve as vents for excess heat andtrapped gas, helping to shape the Earth's climate and influencingthe ``greenhouse effect.''   These ice-free regions, some as large as France, weren'tdiscovered until 1974 when scientists began examining new satelliteimages of Antarctica and the frozen ocean encircling it. Scientistsdon't know if the holes called polynyas existed before then or evenhow frequently they develop in the vast ice cover.   Teams of scientists from the Soviet Union, the United States andWest Germany have worked since 1981 to figure out how the holesform, what role they play in ocean circulation and how they affectthe climate.   Polynya (pronounced ``pa-lean-yah''') is a Russian word used toidentify an area in an ice field that is persistently free of ice,said Arnold Gordon, a professor of physical oceanography at ColumbiaUniversity in New York.   Some oceanographers believe the Antarctic polynyas might play arole in the greenhouse effect that could have dire consequences inthe coming century.   As the world's largest oceans converge in an area unofficiallynamed the Southern Ocean they expel heat from the tropical sun andprobably some carbon dioxide from decaying fish and plants into theatmosphere, oceanographers say.   ``This Antarctic zone region is very important to the globalclimate because this is where the ocean loses heat to theatmosphere,'' said Gordon, an authority on polynyas. Scientistsbelieve that during the winter the polynyas act like vents toeliminate excess heat, and provide outlets for excess carbon dioxidethat could kill marine life.   Some scientists believe the greenhouse effect is caused by excesscarbon dioxide in the atmosphere from tropical deforestation andburning fossil fuels.   Polynyas, by venting carbon dioxide, also may be ``acting likeour burning of fossil fuels and putting more CO2 in the atmosphereand contributing to the greenhouse effect warming of the climate,''Gordon said.   ``That's why it's most critical that we know in the future whatcauses the polynya, what effect the heat and CO2 flux has on thegreenhouse effect and how might that be changed in the future as theearth's atmosphere warms up.''   In a search for those answers, Gordon has visited Antarcticatwice during the Southern Hemisphere's winter. He went in 1981 withSoviet scientists from the Arctic-Antarctic Research Institute inLeningrad, and in 1986 with a West German team from the AlfredWegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Bremerhaven.U.S., Soviet and West German scientists plan this summer to sampleice and water at varying depths near a large underwater ridge calledMaud Rise.   Scientists believe this ridge and others in the ocean floor mayhelp create polynyas by pushing warmer water from the bottom up tothe ice cover, where it melts the ice or prevents it from forming,Gordon said.   Polynyas also may develop because of the Antarctic region's rolein global ocean circulation, Gordon and Josefino C. Comiso, aphysical scientist with the National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration, reported in Scientific American.   ``The exchanges of energy, water and gases between the ocean andthe atmosphere around Antarctica have a major role in determiningthe large-scale motion, temperature and chemical composition of theocean and atmosphere throughout the globe,'' Gordon and Comiso saidin their June report.   When the sun warms the oceans in the tropics and sub-tropics,``the warm water mixes downward by vertical turbulence _ the heatfrom the upper layers is carried down by turbulence to the deepocean,'' Gordon says. The warm water is drawn to Antartica by acomplex process called wind-induced vertical upwelling: as the windblows the upper 300 feet of water northward from Antarctica, it isreplaced by the warmer, deeper water, ``like a giant conveyer belt.''   Scientists have identified two types of polynyas in the iceblanket that can cover an area up to twice the size of thecontinental United States.   Coastal polynyas ``are essentially sea-ice factories,'' Gordonand Comiso wrote. They develop when strong local winds blow ice awayfrom the shoreline and remain unfrozen as warm water surges up fromthe bottom. ``This exposes an area of open ocean on which more icecan form, continuing the process.''   Open-ocean polynyas form in the middle of the vast ice cover onthe ocean around Antarctica and could ``have a great effect on thechemistry and climate of the atmosphere and the deep oceanworldwide,'' Gordon and Comiso wrote. But they ``occur irregularlyand at this point are unpredictable,'' Gordon said.   Scientists believe small polynyas _ about 40 square miles _probably form for several weeks during the Antarctic winter and theninexplicably disappear, but they've also discovered much largerholes in the ice.   ``They are so big that you cannot really think they do not haveany impact at all'' on the Earth's climate, Comiso said in atelephone interview.   In 1974, oceanographers found a polynya about the size of Francein the Weddell Sea's ice cover. During the summer, the ice melted,as it usually does, but in the winter of 1975 the giant polynyamysteriously reformed in just about the same area. It disappearedagain during the summer and reappeared in 1976. In 1977, it didn'treturn. Smaller polynyas have developed for several weeks since thenin the same area, but the mammoth one hasn't returned.   Another large polynya _ 36,000 square kilometers _ has beenobserved since in the Cosmonaut Sea, also in an area of a largeundersea ridge, Gordon said.   ``The real question,'' he said, ``is what causes these really bigones, because those are the ones that will have a major impact onthe climate.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Feb. 9</NOTE></DOC>
