However, company spokesman Peter Thonis saidthere was no connection between the job reductions and the drop in itsearnings forecast.;    The Armonk, N.Y.-based computer giant said the cutswould come primarily through a combination of voluntary incentive programs andattrition.;    IBM has a long-standing policy of reducing its workforcewithout layoffs.;    At the same time, the company said it plans to make aone-time accounting adjustment of $2.3 billion after taxes to recognize thecompany's accumulated pension obligations for current employees.;    IBM hasabout 16,000 employees in the Bay Area. The impact of the work-force reductionprogram on specific sites won't be known for several weeks, however. IBMmanagers first must determine what skills can be spared and who is eligiblefor incentives under the program.;    &quot;There's nothing we can say yet,&quot;explained Walt Keeshan Jr., a spokesman for IBM's manufacturing and researchfacilities in Silicon Valley. Because the program is voluntary, specific cutsdepend entirely upon who is eligible and who chooses to take part, he said.;   IBM said the combination of the job reductions and the accounting adjustmentare not expected to have a material impact on IBM's operating results for theyear.;    Today's announcement was well-received on Wall Street, whereinvestors bid up the price of IBM stock $1.13 a share to $114 in early NewYork Stock Exchange trading.;    Only last week, IBM announced that itsfirst-quarter earnings would be half of what analysts were expecting. Pricecompetition has been fierce in the computer industry in the face of therecession and the Persian Gulf crisis.;    The company said today the job cutswould yield savings before taxes of about $200 million in 1991, $600 millionin 1992 and $800 million annually in future years. IBM employed about 373,000worldwide at the end of 1990.;    &quot;IBM's restructuring actions are measurablyimproving the company's competitiveness,&quot; said John F. Akers, IBM's chairman.&quot;We will continue to take the necessary steps to improve shareholder value forthe years ahead.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Mercury News Staff and Wire Reports  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  New York  </CITY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910328  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1F  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  394  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday March 28, 199100088027,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
