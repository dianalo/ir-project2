MILLS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   States may be faced with two sets of numbersfor congressional redistricting under a court agreement aimed atadjusting the 1990 census for an historical undercount ofminorities, a House panel was told Tuesday.   The potential of two sets of figures also may influence whetherthe commerce secretary makes the adjustment official, DanielMelnick and David Huckabee told the House Post Office subcommitteeon census and population.   The panel is studying whether legislation is needed to correctany problems with last July's court agreement over the censusadjustment. The agreement stemmed from a lawsuit seeking to forcethe Commerce Department to adjust the census for its historicalundercount of minorities.   The Census Bureau has been criticized for missing from 1 percentto 2 percent of the population in the 1980 census, and as much as 5percent of minorities, because some people do not respond toquestionnaires or refuse to cooperate with canvassers.   New York City, for instance, has estimated that the 1980 censusmissed up to 500,000 of its residents, costing the city $52 milliona year in federal funds that are awarded on the basis ofpopulation. The census figures are also used to determine thenumber of congressional seats that states gain or lose.   In a report analyzing the agreement, Melnick and Huckabee, whowork for the Congressional Research Service of the Library ofCongress, raised key questions about it.   Questions included whether states should begin drawing districtlines with initial counts or wait until the (commerce) secretarydecides whether to adjust the figures.   By law, the Census Bureau must provide the president with anoverall national head count by Dec. 31, 1990, and the states withlocalized breakdowns by April 1, 1991.   Under the July agreement, however, the Census Bureau will alsoperform a follow-up survey of 150,000 households to find andcorrect any undercount. If the commerce secretary decides to makethe adjustment official, the adjusted numbers would be released tothe states no later than July 15, 1991.   The government analysts also raised the question of whetherstates should change the dates by which they must adopt newdistrict guidelines.   ``To effect these changes, should states change the dates oftheir primaries in 1992 or the dates by which candidates must filetheir intention to run?'' the report asked.</TEXT></DOC>
