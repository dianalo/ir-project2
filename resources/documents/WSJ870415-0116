BulkeleyStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 04/15/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> WANBEARNINGS (ERN)COMPUTERS (EDP) </IN><DATELINE> LOWELL, Mass.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Wang Laboratories Inc. posted a small profit for its fiscal third quarter ended March 31, bouncing back from two quarters of losses.    The computer maker, doing better than most analysts expected, reported that net income fell 72% to $5.9 million, or four cents a share, from the year-earlier net of $21.4 million, or 14 cents a share. Revenue rose a stronger-than-expected 8.8% to $745.9 million from $685.3 million.    The Wang results, in the wake of better-than-expected results from International Business Machines Corp. and NCR Corp., appear to indicate a modest upturn in the depressed computer business. Frederic Cohen, an analyst with L.F. Rothschild, said, &quot;We have to be braced for positive surprises. My sense is that something definitely has improved in the computer demand environment.&quot;    Frederick A. Wang, who was named president in November, said the turnaround from the two previous quarters reflected both the sales improvement and cost-cutting efforts started early in the quarter. He added, &quot;We are convinced that our stated goal of solid profitability for the fourth quarter is quite realistic and achievable.&quot; In the year-earlier fourth quarter Wang reported net income of $801,000, or one cent a share. Mr. Wang declined to predict fourth-quarter results but several analysts said they expect Wang to earn 15 cents to 25 cents a share.    Wang Class B stock closed yesterday in American Stock Exchange composite trading at $15.375 a share, up 75 cents, on volume of more than one million shares.    The company originally had targeted break-even operations for the third quarter. Mr. Wang said &quot;the great progress we have made in this period strengthens our confidence considerably.&quot; Wang had a history of dramatic growth until two years ago when it faltered in the face of the personal computer onslaught in its main market, the office.    The company said that new orders during the quarter were $734.9 million, up 21% from the weak level in the year-earlier period. Ian Diery, senior vice president, U.S. operations, said that the turnaround was important because &quot;a lot of customers have been looking to see how Wang would do financially.&quot;    Mr. Wang said the third-quarter sales gains included a 6% improvement in the U.S. market, which has been depressed in recent quarters, and a 13% gain overseas, where Wang made about 40% of its sales. He said sales of Wang's most expensive products improved.    For the nine months, Wang reported a net loss of $102.7 million, compared with net income of $50.1 million, or 35 cents a share in the year-earlier period. Revenue rose 4.5% to $2.01 billion from $1.93 billion.    Separately, Wang introduced several new products that allow pictures and images to be stored on optical disks and then shown on special computer screens. The systems work with Wang's current line of computers, and Wang officials predicted they may sell as much as $100 million of the systems in fiscal 1988. Small systems for a corporate department or a law office will cost around $100,000 and will go on sale this summer. Larger systems, available late this year, can cost more than $1 million.    Many companies are working on ways to combine the vast storage capacity of optical disks, with the power of computers to retrieve and reorganize information. Some consultants predict the disks will replace microfilm and file cabinets. But the market is unproved.    &quot;Wang is really the first to come out with a totally integrated system,&quot; said Leellen Spelman, an analyst with Martin Simpson andamp; Co. in New York. &quot;Conceptually at least, it's a very appealing product. But at this point it's still pie in the sky.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
