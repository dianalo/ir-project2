The approachis based on application of dynamic equations of superconductivity formulatedon the basis of the Lagrangian formalism. These equations are generalizedthe Ginzburg-Landau theory in the nonstationary non-equilibrium casefor ''foul'' superconductors. The value estimations of volume forcesarising in inhomogeneities during relaxation of an order parameter andwhen the electrical field is penetrated into the superconductor, aregiven. 15 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
