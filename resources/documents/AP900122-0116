(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The forgotten victims of Hurricane Hugo arestill struggling to survive in roofless trailers along gravel backroads in coastal Williamsburg County, or in modest cinderblockhomes on the outskirts of tobacco towns.   Life for hundreds _ some say thousands _ of South Carolina'srural poor is not much better than the day after the killerhurricane struck.   The storm, which crashed ashore last Sept. 21 at Charleston,claimed 29 lives and caused an estimated $5.9 billion damage whenit cut a swath hundreds of miles wide through the state. AfterHugo, 24 of the state's 46 counties were declared federal disasterareas.   While relief immediately flowed to coastal areas, countiesdozens of miles inland _ many of them rural and populated by poorblacks _ were ignored in some cases.   Four months after the hurricane, there are few offers of help,even though workers and building supplies are still needed, saidEdna Hampton, the Hugo outreach coordinator for Williamsburg County.   Officials estimate as many as 4,000 structures were destroyed orheavily damaged in that county, one of the poorest in the state.   ``Before the storm came, some of the homes were half liveable,''she said. ``Now they're not liveable. People are a little bitdiscouraged. We feel forgotten in a sense.''   She has been trying to locate people who may not have appliedfor disaster assistance yet. Illiteracy, lack of communication andtransportation and suspicion of government have kept many ruralresidents from seeking aid, she said.   In her small cinderblock house on the outskirts of Kingstree,Audrey Epps fights back tears as she remembers how the stormsmashed the windows and tore the roof off her home. Ms. Epps andher 78-year-old invalid mother, Zeal, had to seek shelter in theonly room of the five-room house that didn't leak. She lostclothing and other personal effects.   Ms. Epps lost her job because the pharmaceutical company whereshe worked third shift was shut down by storm damage. She can'tfind another third-shift job and can't afford to pay someone tolook after her mother during the day. When she worked nights, arelative stayed with her mother.   ``The only thing I can do is stay here and take care of her,''Ms. Epps said.   Nor does she have the funds to adequately repair and refurnishher home. She received $2,750 from the Federal Emergency ManagementAgency, but supplies to fix the roof alone came to $1,800. Theceilings and walls are waterlogged and still need repair. Plasticsheeting covers broken windows, keeping in heat from a wood-burningstove.   ``I didn't want a beautiful home. I only wanted a house I couldlive in,'' Ms. Epps said recently.   ``I thought once I would snap, I still think I might,'' Ms. Eppssaid, sobbing.   A few miles south, down a gravel road near the community ofLane, George Bradshaw and his two mentally handicapped sons live ina trailer roofed by a plastic tarp, without electricity, drawingwater from a pump up the road.   ``We've been here ever since the storm,'' said Bradshaw, who isretired.   Bradshaw's insurance company settled by paying off the mortgageon the trailer, leaving the family with only a few hundred dollars,not enough to make repairs.   A handful of out-of-state volunteers are at work in the county,such as John Nienhuis, who arrived with a group from the ChristianReformed Church of Grand Rapids, Mich.   He said workers many times are trying to repair homes thatreally should be leveled and rebuilt from scratch. ``We're puttingso many good hours into jobs and when they're done, they're (homes)not worth 5 cents,'' he said.   Recovery from the storm won't be measured by how well thestate's beaches are restored or how many tourists return, but byhow all of the state's people recover, says J.T. McLawhorn Jr.,president of the Columbia Urban League.   ``We, individually and collectively, are going to be heldresponsible for this recovery,'' he said.</TEXT><TEXT>   Editors: The Hugo Relief Fund, operated through the SouthCarolina governor's office in Columbia, may be reached at (803)734-9818.</TEXT></DOC>
