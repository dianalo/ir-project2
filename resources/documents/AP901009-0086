The justices, without comment, rejected the appeal of aPennsylvania high school forced to rent weekend use of itsauditorium to the Campus Crusade for Christ.   The action was announced the day David H. Souter becamehistory's 105th justice, but he did not participate in the case.   Souter was sworn in a brief courtroom ceremony before all ninejustices took the bench to issue orders in new cases and heararguments in cases to be decided by July.   In another case involving religion, the court rejected an appealby a small fundamentalist church in Evanston, Ill., that blamed itstrouble finding a permanent home on a local zoning ordinance.   The court, without comment, refused to revive Love Church'schallenge to the city ordinance.   In a third case, the court turned down the appeal of a Seattlechurch that says King County should have to pay it for blocking theuse of church-owned land. It left intact a Washington Supreme Courtruling that a lawsuit filed against the county by the Presbytery ofSeattle was premature.   In other cases, the court:   -Let stand a ruling that the constitutional rights of anemotionally disturbed Texas boy allegedly beaten by his schoolprincipal were not violated.   Ronald and Nancy Fee, said Joseph Herndon brutally beat their12-year-old son when he refused to submit to being paddled threetimes for misbehaving in class. Herndon and a teacher who waspresent said the boy was paddled three times on the buttocks andthat injuries he suffered were caused by his thrashing about on thefloor as he sought to avoid the paddling.   -Revived a $4 billion lawsuit by a millionaire inventor ArthurJones, who says ABC-TV's ``20-20'' program falsely portrayed him asa liar and hypocrite.   The justices told a federal appeals court to restudy the libelsuit filed after a 1987 report on the fate of 63 baby elephantsJones rescued from death in Africa. Jones invented the Nautilusexercise machines.   The justices said the case should be reconsidered in light oftheir June ruling that the Constitution's guarantee of free speechdid not ``create a wholesale defamation exemption for anything thatmight be labeled opinion.''   -Agreed to decide in a Florida case whether police may conductrandom drug searches aboard buses and trains after passengers haveconsented. Florida officials say the searches are necessary becausethe state is a pipeline for drugs.   In the Pennsylvania case involving the use of public schoolfacilities by religious group, the state court upheld the dismissalof the suit. It said the church failed to exhaust itsadministrative remedies because it never even applied for abuilding permit.   In June, the high court upheld the federal Equal Access Act, inwhich Congress required that virtually all public high schools mustallow student prayer groups to meet and worship if other studentclubs are permitted at school.   The court said then the law doesn't violate the constitutionallyrequired separation of church and state. But the federal lawapplies only to student groups - not to outside organizationsseeking sue of school facilities.   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals relied on the FirstAmendment when it ruled last summer that Centennial, Pa., schoolofficials violated the free-speech rights of Student Venture, asubsidiary of the Campus Crusade for Christ.   The officials refused to rent space for a William Tennent HighSchool program aimed at religious conversion.   By a 2-1 vote, the appeals court said the school district hadcreated an ``open public forum'' by renting space to, among others,the local Rotary and Kiwanis clubs, an adult education program andtwo labor unions.   The appeals court said religious groups could not be excludedfrom such an open forum because of their message.   The school district's lawyers said schools nationwide letvarious community groups use school property when classes are insession, and that the appeals court ruling means such use has``converted most American public school facilities into open publicforums, to which even the most fractious religious and politicalspeakers must be routinely allowed access.''   The three cases involving religion were: Centennial SchoolDistrict vs. Gregoire, 90-304; Love Church vs. Evanston, 90-296;and Presbytery of Seattle vs. King County, 90-298.</TEXT></DOC>
