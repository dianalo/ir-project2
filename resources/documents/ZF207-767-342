MicroVAX II host system running VMS version 5.1andM;PRICE AS TESTED: $464 (EM220 software, $189; LK250 keyboard, $275)andM;PROS: Is easy to install and to learnandM;Functions can be assigned to keys easilyandM;Provides default keyboardassignments for many keyboard layouts, includingDEC's LK250andM;Supports Kermit and XmodemandM;Includes logging featureandM;Has unusually clear documentationandM;CON: Location of Break key on LK250 keyboard is counter-intuitiveandM;Is unable to display double-high, double-wide text accuratelyandM;Emulator's version of Kermit is slower than standard kermitandM;READER SERVICE: Fill In No.andP;  400 on Reader Service CardandM;For or business that rely on both PCs and VAXes to get the day's work done,it makes sense that users be able to access both systems from one keyboard.andO;But users accustomed to working on a VT220 terminal often stumble when tryingto find their way around the PC keyboard.andM;Diversified Computer Systems (DCS) has a creative solution to this problem.andO;Its EM220 software--a VT220 emulation package--turns the PC into a credibleimitation of DEC's own VT220, and users longing for even more familiarity canbuy a DEC LK250 keyboard along with it, offering the key layouts sowell-known and loved by VT220 and VT320 users.andM;Some keys on the DCS version of the LK250 have extra information that canassist EM220 users, such as a description of the key's PC keypad function.andO;The keyboard also features some alternates to DEC's LK250, such as an Alt keywhere the VT220's Compose Character key would be found.andM;Although EM220 can be used without this keyboard, the familiar VT220 layoutmakes it even easier to access the power of the VAX from a desktop PC.andM;We tested EM220 version 4.13 on an IBM PC XT running DOS version 3.30connected to a MicroVAX II running VMS version 5.1.andP;  The PC was connectedusing an RS-232-C cable to a terminal server.andP;  EM220 requires at least oneasynchronous serial port, DOS version 2.0 or higher, and 256KB of memory,though we found it took up only 199KB on our system.andP;  It can communicatethrough ports COM1, COM2 and COM3, and it supports DEC's full multinational8-bit character set.andM;EASY AS PIEandM;Installing EM220 on the PC's hard disk was quick and easy.andP;  We simpleinserted one of the package's three 5-1/4-inch diskettes in drive A:, typedINSTALL, and answered prompts until the installation was complete, insertingother diskettes as requested.andP;  We created DOS subdirectories for the filetransfer software (ASCII, Xmodem and Kermit) and copied them to the hard diskfrom the supplementary files diskette.andM;To invoke EM220, users type EM at the DOS prompt.andP;  A status line at thebottom of the screen shows the user which terminal is being emulated (VT220,VT100 or VT52), whether 7-bit or 8-bit emulation is being used, whether thePC is in 80- or 132-column mode, whether it is on-line or off-line, whatkeypad mode is in use (numeric or arrows), which keys are assigned the Exitand Help functions, and other information.andP;  Pressing andless;Altandgt; andless;F17andgt; switchesbetween DEC and IBM PC mode.andM;Users can move back and forth between sessions on the host and the PC bypressing the DOS &quot;hot key,&quot; which by default is assigned to andless;Controlandgt;andless;Shiftandgt;.andM;Users can tailor EM220 communications settings and keyboard definitions fordifferent host systems with the Main Setup Menu (Fig.andP;  1), which is invokedby pressing andless;F3andgt;.andP;  The initial menu screen controls many of the same settingsthe VT220 Display Setup screen does, such as auto wrap and cursor style.andO;Other setup screens, invoked by pressing function keys, control keyboardoptions, file transfer settings and special settings unique to the terminalemulator, such as the name of the initialization file.andM;Users can set DOS symbols to specify other information about the environment,such as the directory where the software is located.andP;  The system also comeswith configuration files for different host operating systems, including VMSversion 3 and version 4, RSTS, RSX-11M, Micro/RSX, RT-11, Tops-20, both theBourne and C shells of Unix, and IBM CMS in line mode.andM;Ten default key-definition files comes with the software.andP;  Which file userschoose depends on what keyboard they use.andP;  In addition to the DEC LK250,EM220 comes with default key definitions for the original IBM PC keyboard,the IBM PC AT keyboard, a modified version of the standard PC or AT keyboard,the IBM enhanced keyboard, the ATandamp;T 6300 Plus, the Keytronic KB5151, theSilicon Beach Technologies SBT-220, the Toshiba 3100 series and the Zenith200 series.andM;Users can also define their own keys with the DEFINE KEY command, which worksmuch like its VMS counterpart.andP;  The user specifies a key name and a string orseries of tokens that will be invoked when the they is pressed.andP;  Tokens arewords that stand for emulator functions (such as Break, dial and Kermit) orVT220 keys (such as PF1, F10 and Find).andP;  As with the DEFINE KEY command inVMS, /NOECHO and /TERMINATE qualifiers are available.andM;Commands such as DEFINE KEY can be entered either in the initialization file,which is called EMINIT.ECF, or by pressing andless;Altandgt; C to invoke command mode andbring up the CMDandgt; prompt.andM;One small quibble we had with the default key assignments was the placementof the Break key.andP;  On a normal LK250 keyboard, the Break key is the F5 key.andO;By default the VAX setup of EM220 makes the Break key andless;Altandgt; B and assigns theF5 key the Receive ASCII File function.andP;  However, users who are bothered bythis assignment can change it in their set-up files.andM;Users can log terminal sessions by pressing andless;Altandgt; L.andP;  When invoked, thisfunction prompts for a file name.andP;  If the file already exists, the programwill prompt the user to quit, overwrite or append to the file.andP;  If the useroverwrites or appends, everything from that point on that appears on thescreen is echoed to the log file.andM;Users can play back log files by pressing andless;Altandgt;:.andP;  Users can control playbackspeed, and they can also cause playback to pause at every page, every timethe screen is cleared, or upon finding a specified string.andM;WHAT YOU SEE ...andM;By pressing andless;Shiftandgt;andless;F1andgt; while in setup mode, users with color monitors canset video attributes such as underlining, bold and reverse video to whatevercolors they desire.andP;  Users with monochrome monitors can select intensitiesthe same way.andP;  There are also four options for showing underlined characterson PCs with EGA cards that do not support underlining.andM;Even users without special hardware can show full 132-character lines bychoosing Hardware mode from the Special Setup Menu (accessed as a submenu ofthe Main Setup Menu) and EGA/VGA Software Driver from the 132 Board SelectionMenu.andM;Regardless of the board used, EM220 does not support double-high, double-widealphabetic characters.andP;  Instead, it prints a single line of text with a spacebetween each letter (Fig.andP;  2).andP;  (EM220 is able to display double-high,double-wide line-drawing characters correctly.)andM;EM220 gives users back-scrolling capability with a scroll memory feature.andO;Pressing andless;Altandgt;S turns this feature on and off.andP;  When it is enabled, users canuse cursor movement keys to page back through the last several pages thatappeared on the terminal.andP;  Because lines of text in scrolled memory arestored as variable-length records, the number of pages available depends onhow much text appeared on the screen.andM;EM220 lets users program softkeys, which are simply text strings of as manyas 62 characters associated with user-defined keys.andP;  The functions invoked bythe softkeys can be delayed until specified data is received from the host,and the softkeys can execute DOS command files.andM;The EM220 software can store and dial phone numbers on any Hayes-compatiblemodem.andP;  Each line on the Modem Dialer screen can contain a name and number ofa modem to dial, and users have the option to specify a command file (whichmay be a softkey definition) to automate the login process after theconnection is made, and to specify a setup file to set up communicationsparameters.andM;Instead of using a modem, we linked our PC XT directly to the VAX with a nullmodel cable from the COM1 port to the VAX's terminal server.andM;Running at 19,200 bits per second (bps) was a bit too fast for an XT, whoseserial port can't handle that speed.andP;  As a result, a few characters weredropped from every screen.andM;After adjusting the speed to 9600 bps, we found we were still losingcharacters.andP;  A call to DCS helped pinpoint the problem: memory-resident PCsoftware running in the background was trapping XON/XOFF, the protocol usedto synchronize data transmission between the PC and the host.andP;  Rebootingafter taking that software's invocation out of our PC's initialization file,(AUTOEXEC.BAT) solved the problem.andM;We also found that when we pressed andless;Lockandgt; to keep letters uppercase, thenpressed the Shift key and typed while logged in to the host, the emulatorcaused lowercase letters to be transmitted, which is what the PC normallydoes.andP;  As VAX users, we would prefer that letters remain uppercase underthose circumstances.andM;Users can transfer files from the host to the PC using ASCII, Xmodem andKermit protocols.andM;We used DR Labs' eight benchmark tests to see how long EM220's Kermittransfers took.andP;  These tests consist of transfering four standard filesbetween the VAX and the PC.andP;  Two are text files of 407 and 30 blocks; theothers are binary files of 131 and 20 blocks.andM;EM220's Kermit has no local server mode on the PC.andP;  To send or receive files,users first log in to the host, then invoke Kermit, put it into server mode,and press andless;Altandgt; K to invoke Kermit on the PC.andP;  They then enter a GET or SENDcommand to transfer files.andP;  To stop the server on the host, users enter theEND command on the PC, then press andless;Controlandgt; Z to end Kermit on the host.andM;We clocked the time it took to receive the files from the host and to sendthem back over a 9600-bps Ethernet connection (Fig.andP;  3).andP;  EM220's Kermit wasslower than the standard Kermit-MS version 2.27-11 for each of the eightoperations.andP;  Users who transfer many files between the host and PC may findthis extra time a drawback.andM;DCS officials say they plan to add support for the latest version of Kermitto EM220, which could speed up file transfer times significantly.andM;EM220 is a good example of a product designed with the user in mind.andP;  Itcomes with comprehensive on-line help, which looks to the user very much likeVMS help.andM;The product's documentation comes in one small three-ring binder.andP;  It'scomplete, clear and well-organized.andM;We particularly appreciated the &quot;Common Problems&quot; sections in theIntroduction and Using Modems chapters.andP;  These sections detail variousdifficulties that users might encounter and their solutions.andM;EM220 is priced at $189 for a single-copy or network license.andP;  Discounts areavailable for sites with 30 or more users.andM;All in all, EM220 has been engineered to do just what a user wants a terminalemulator to do, and to do it sensibly and easily.andM;A lot of thought has gone into making the product as handy for users aspossible.andP;  VAX users who begin to work on PCs running EM220 will feel rightat home.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
