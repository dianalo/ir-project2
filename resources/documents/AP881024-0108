The Democratic nominee told a rally of supporters that he _ likethe World Series champion Los Angeles Dodgers _ was headed towardan upset victory in the Nov. 8 election.   Dukakis said the Bush campaign was based on distortions andmisrepresentations of his record as Massachusetts governor. Hepromised to ``take my case directly to you'' in the two remainingweeks of the presidential campaign.   ``You know, Mark Twain once said that a lie can travel half wayaround the world while the truth is still putting on its shoes,''Dukakis told the rally at the outset of a full day of campaigningin California.   ``Mr. Bush must have read Mark Twain,'' Dukakis said. ``Becausehe's running a campaign based on distortions and distractions _ andoutright lies. Why? Because he can't win an election where the realissues are discussed, the real challenges are faced and the realdifferences are made known.''   Campaigning as an underdog populist, Dukakis criticized the vicepresident's proposal for a capital gains tax credit, which Dukakissaid would give Bush an annual tax break of $22,000.   ``George Bush wants to give people like George Bush a tax breakthat's more than the average California worker makes in a year,''Dukakis said. ``Look beside you. Look behind you. Look in themirror and ask yourself: Is George Bush on your side?''   Responding in a speech at Portland, Maine, the vice presidentsaid: ``I will push for a cut in the capital gains tax for a verysimple reason _ it's not to favor the rich; it will help createjobs.''   ``My opponent calls this typically a tax cut for the rich,''Bush said. ``He's wrong. He's dead wrong.''   The Democratic nominee told a boisterous rally on his arrivalSunday night at Burbank, Calif., that Bush's disavowal of a GOPcampaign brochure fell far short of what was need to restore theproper tone to the contest. The brochure said murderers and rapistssupported Dukakis.   ``When you put garbage out in the street, you've got aresponsibility to clean it up,'' Dukakis told the cheeringsupporters at the Burbank airport.   Dukakis said Bush and his fellow Republicans have ``resorted todistortions and misrepresentations, outright lying,'' because they``don't want to deal with the real issues and real challenges thatface our nation.''   The Massachusetts governor invoked the Los Angeles Dodgers, theunderdog winners last week of the baseball World Series, inpromising an Election Day upset.   ``You know and I know the Dodgers weren't supposed to wineither,'' Dukakis said. ``Yeah, we're a little bit behind, butwe're fighting back.''   Dukakis was spending all of today in California, the biggestElectoral College prize with 47 votes, beginning his day by meetingwith supporters and members of the Asian-American community of LosAngeles.   He arrived here after a flight from Boston that included arefueling stop in Eau Claire, Wis., where Dukakis addressed a rallyof about 600 people gathered on a chilly night inside a hangar.   There he began a new campaign week essentially where he left offlast week _ assailing the tone of the Republican campaign.   Dukakis said Bush has distorted his record and positions onseveral issues and for the first time he raised Bush's disavowal ofthe Illinois campaign brochure.   ``Disavowal isn't enough,'' said Dukakis, who last week referredto the brochure as ``garbage.''   ``Let's get that stuff out of this campaign,'' Dukakis said.   Dukakis, whose new campaign commercials denounce GOP distortionsof his positions, said Bush has wrongly told farm-state audiencesthe Democratic ticket supports an embargo on grain sales to theSoviet Union.   ``We don't'' Dukakis said. ``We never have. We never will. Heknows that.''   Dukakis also singled out gun control and accused both Bush andthe National Rifle Association of distorting his views.   ``I've always supported the rights of hunters and sportsmen tohave weapons and to use them,'' Dukakis said, adding that his majorconcern was the availability of handguns and automatic weapons toinner-city children.   Dukakis urged those at the rally to ``set the record straightamong your neighbors and friends.''   Dukakis, continuing an effort he began last week, planned tokeep a high television profile in the two weeks leading to theelection. He was appearing tonight on Larry King's talk show on theCable News Network and for 90 minutes Tuesday on ABC's``Nightline.''   He also has purchased five-minute slots on the networks thisTuesday, Sunday, Nov. 1 and Nov. 5, as well as a half-hour on thethree major broadcast networks on election eve.   Meanwhile, aides accused Bush of allowing racist appeals topermeate his campaign message, specifically in his attack on aMassachusetts furlough program that granted a weekend pass to amurderer who escaped and raped a Maryland woman. The inmate isblack, the victim white.   Flying to Connecticut this morning for a campaign tour of NewEngland, the vice president asserted that ``there isn't anyracism'' in his TV ads about Horton, and said the Democrats weremerely engaged in desperation tactics.   Dukakis' running mate, Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, said Sunday hebelieved there were racist appeals in the Bush message.   Campaign vice chairman John Sasso told reporters Dukakis agreedwith Bentsen. Dukakis himself refused to answer when asked if heagreed with his running mate, offering only a shrug.   Dukakis aides, seeking to bolster their case, distributed copiesof an Atlanta Constitution column in which a Bush aide is quoted assaying of Dukakis:   ``We are going to show he is so far left he's to the left ofcollard greens, black-eyed peas and strip-row cotton.'' The quotewas attributed to Chris Henick, Bush's Southern regional director.</TEXT></DOC>
