Foundation head Peter C. Goldmark said Wednesday that Mandelawants to ``have it ready to go when a representative government inSouth Africa is chosen.''   Mandela, Goldmark and several officials of the African NationalCongress met in London on Tuesday to continue discussions and forma working group.   Goldmark made the proposal at a June 22 meeting between theanti-apartheid leader and business leaders in New York.   He likened it then to the Marshall Plan, which helpedwar-ravaged Europe 40 years ago, and efforts now being made to helpEastern European countries recover from communism.   Other executives at the meeting said the idea appeared togenerate strong interest and Mandela called the proposal``constructive and imaginative.''   Goldmark said in a telephone interview from his Brooklyn home onWednesday that the hour-long, follow-up meeting was held atMandela's request.   ``He didn't let any grass grow under his feet on this one,''Goldmark said.   Goldmark said he would work with two ANC officials _ ForeignSecretary Thabo Mbeki and Treasurer Thomas Nkobi _ ``to design astructure through which that business interest can be channeled.''   Other governments also will be approached as potentialcontributors, he said.   ``They are going to lead the effort,'' he said, referring to theANC. The Rockefeller Foundation would assist with the actualmechanics of setting up an organization.   Goldmark said Mandela had not ruled out creating an agency``under the roof of an existing institution,'' such as the WorldBank.   But he said he felt a separate bank would be an ``identifiable,focused mechanism for tapping the energy and interest that's outthere.''</TEXT></DOC>
