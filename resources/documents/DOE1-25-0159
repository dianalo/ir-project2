Principalamong them are the non-controllable factors of the external economicenvironment such as international friction (wars) and energy monopolies(OPEC): both of these factors are relatively short-term. The underlyingincreasing demand for energy, for a growing world, is a long-term trendmodified by rates of industrial growth and conservation; which are energyprice and GNP or GDP related. The price of coal will have to remain ata factor of 2.5 to 3.0 cheaper than crude oil for it to be competitiveand maintain an adequate share of the fossil fuel market.
