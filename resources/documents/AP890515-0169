Michael Peoples, 34, believed for 12 days that he had AIDSbecause of a mixup in the laboratory at the Veterans AdministrationHospital and learned the truth on March 7, the same day he said hehad resolved to kill himself.   ``A lab technician assigned the same number to two patients,''hospital spokesman Craig Koller said Monday. ``We regret it verymuch. It's something we acknowledge took place and we're veryconcerned about.''   Peoples said he now lives in a Columbus shelter for the homelesssince his girlfriend kicked him out and he lost his job.   Peoples told The Columbus Dispatch he was notified Feb. 23 hehad AIDS. He said he was so depressed by the diagnosis that ``Iwrote a suicide note and decided I was going to carry it out theday before my birthday (March 8).''   Koller said the hospital was trying to contact Peoples and hisemployer, a temporary service company where he tagged shippingcrates, as well as his girlfriend ``to help rectify this.''   Koller said the lab technician probably will not be punished.   ``It was an error that was caught and rectified. The procedurethat allowed this to happen was investigated and subsequentlyrevised,'' he said.   ``I would say this is a very rare occurrence. It has never hadhappen before. Our lab service does close to 2 million lab tests ayear.''   Koller would neither confirm nor deny Peoples' claim that adoctor at the hospital told Peoples' sister and son about the AIDSdiagnosis before the error was caught and before Peoples could tellthem himself.   ``It is against all of our policies and procedures to give outsuch information to anyone other than the patient,'' Koller said.   Peoples, who had entered the hospital for treatment ofalcoholism, told the newspaper that before the error was corrected,his former fiancee called his employer, believing she had beenexposed to the virus.   Peoples said his employer did not admit the AIDS diagnosis costhim his job. The employer said his job had been filled while he wasin the hospital, Peoples said.   The newspaper did not identify Peoples' former employer, hisformer fiancee or his girlfriend.</TEXT></DOC>
