(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Striking United Mine Workers members blockedcoal trucks and damaged two vehicles Friday in an attempt to haltshipments by non-union coal companies, authorities said.   Gov. Gaston Caperton said he had not heard from The Pittston Co.,parent company of Pittston Coal Group, about his latest offer to letthe UMW and Pittston use his home or office for negotiations tosettle the strike.   ``They have obviously decided they don't want to respondaffirmatively to the letter I sent,'' Caperton said, decliningfurther comment.   Caperton twice in the past week has invited the two sides to meetin Charleston and settle the strike. The UMW has accepted both timesand Pittston now has rejected both offers.   After a closed meeting of about 1,000 UMW members in Logan onFriday morning, about 150 miners drove to Kenova, where they blockedtrucks trying to leave a non-union coal-loading terminal on the BigSandy River.   Many miners wore bandanas over their faces despite state law thatprohibits West Virginians from covering their faces in public. Statetroopers showed up but made no arrests, warning to the miners ofheavy traffic on U.S. 52.   About 1,900 UMW members are on strike against Pittston inKentucky, Virginia and West Virginia, and their strike that beganApril 5 has spawned wildcat walkouts by at least 37,000 miners ineight states.   In Alabama on Friday, bullets apparently were fired at a coalbarge and a coal truck in Walker County. A coal barge moving alongthe Warrior River near Cordova reportedly was fired on, and a truckreceived gunshot damage while parked near Jasper, sheriff's deputiessaid. No one was injured.   In West Virginia, four men who identified themselves asfurloughed miners were arrested Thursday night after power was cutto the New Elk Mining Co. mine near Horse Creek while miners workedinside, state police said Friday.   Federal charges of cutting power to an operating mine werepending, troopers said.   On Friday, 300 members of the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workersunion walked off the job at an Alloy metals plant for half an hourin support of the Pittston strikers.   It was the first walkout by another union in support of the UMWin this strike; members of the United Steelworkers in Pennsylvaniahave refused to cross UMW picket lines, however.   And with an eye to shootings and rock-throwing incidents thathave marred the strikes in recent days, UMW officials in Pikeville,Ky., banned strikers from setting off fireworks on the picket linesover the Fourth of July weekend.   ``Just to preserve our image that this is a peaceful picket, itwould be in our best interest not to have any fireworks on thepicket line,'' said Glenn Stanley, president of UMW Local 5737.``The sounds could be confusing.''   The Pittston strike began peacefully. But there has beenscattered violence since the wildcat strikes began, including someshootings in West Virginia and Alabama.</TEXT></DOC>
