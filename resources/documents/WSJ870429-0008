The declining value of the dollar and currency devaluations in several Third World countries accounted for other changes in the results of the survey, which is compiled twice annually by Business International Corp., a New York-based research and consulting firm with an office here.    With an index figure of 191 against New York's 100, Tokyo topped the list. In second place was another Japanese city, Osaka, 187, followed by Brazzaville, the capital of Congo, with 173. New York, in 20th place last July, took 34th in the latest 102-city survey. Lagos, the capital of Nigeria, headed the list two years ago but has dropped to 94th place, following a currency devaluation.    Geneva and the Swiss financial capital of Zurich are the most expensive European cities, in 10th and 11th place. Mexico City and Caracas, the capital of Venezuela, retained rankings as the least costly cities for expatriates.    The only other U.S. cities in the top 40 were Los Angeles and Washington, ranked 36th and 38th, respectively.    The survey is based on an index taking into account food, household supplies, recreation, transportation and other items but not including housing. It is intended to help multinational companies determine the cost of differentials paid to expatriate employees.    Survey results are based on exchange rates in effect in late January. Since then, the dollar has declined further. </TEXT></DOC>
