The cry that echoedthrough the demonstration: &quot;No blood for oil.&quot;   Mr. McMillan understands the irony. While &quot;zipping alongat 75,&quot; he says, &quot;I thought, `Here I am, doing what's cheaperand easier for me in the short run, rather than doing what'sgood for future generations'&quot; by traveling by train or bus tosave oil and lessen pollution. But &quot;if I had any guilt,&quot; the28-year-old child-care worker adds, &quot;I managed to look theother way and walk quickly away from it.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The Gulf war has brought into sharper-than-ever relief thesplit between what Americans say about energy and what theydo.   In a poll conducted by the Gallup Organization in Augustafter the crisis began, 73% said the U.S. energy situationwas &quot;fairly&quot; or &quot;very&quot; serious, but only 3% said they hadturned down their thermostats or reduced use of electricappliances, and 10% had turned off lights at home more often.Just 2% said they had bought a gas-saving car and 3% saidthey were carpooling.   Oil is the source of about 40% of America's energy. TheU.S. is the world leader in oil consumption, using twice asmuch per capita as European competitors. Imported oilaccounted for more than half the U.S. trade deficit lastyear. The federal government is spending as much on thePersian Gulf war every five to 10 hours as it has budgetedfor energy-efficiency research in all of fiscal 1991.   Energy conservation groups hope the war might finallypersuade Americans to practice what they preach. In anationwide survey last month conducted by bipartisanpollsters on behalf of the Union of Concerned Scientists andthe Alliance to Save Energy, oil was named most frequently asthe main reason U.S. troops were sent to the Gulf. Two-thirdssaid they feared the U.S. was entering a period of energycrises, and 84% said they favored raising federal fueleconomy standards for cars.   &quot;People are beginning to realize this country is fuelish,&quot;says Vincent Breglio, who helped conduct the poll and wasco-director of policy and polling for President Bush's 1988campaign. &quot;That's going to give politicians an opportunityfor a lot of slam-bam action on the bully pulpit.&quot;   The action -- or at least the talk -- is about to begin inCongress, where several oil-saving bills that were quashedearlier are being resurrected. At least two broad-rangingenergy packages, calling for things like more federalspending on mass transit and solar-energy research, will beintroduced, say congressional staffers. Two other bills arein the works to increase new automobiles' fuel economy. A&quot;clunker&quot; bill, which would give drivers incentives to tradein their old gas guzzlers, also is expected to re-emergesoon.   It isn't clear how much support any of these bills mightcommand in Congress and it's likely the Bush administrationwould oppose them. White House officials helped defeat theautomobile fuel-economy bill last year and are resistingaggressive conservation measures sought by environmentalists.   State policy makers also are likely to jump in with energyinitiatives. California, for example, is expected to enact agroundbreaking law this year that would lower sales taxes onfuel-efficient cars and place surcharges on gas guzzlers.   But has the outbreak of war really changed the terms ofthe oil debate at the grass-roots level? Consider anunscientific study conducted on a bright winter afternoon inthe company of Massachusetts State Police Trooper RichardPowers, who deals with American attitudes about energy wherethe rubber meets the road.   His beat is Interstate 93, a major artery through Boston,where he cruises a 20-mile stretch in an unmarked carenforcing the speed limit. The tickets he hands out seem likefistfuls of sand hurled against a tidal wave: So many driversare flouting the 55-mile-per-hour speed limit that he hastime to nab only the worst offenders. The slowest speeder hepulls over this afternoon is going 77.   &quot;I don't really need the radar,&quot; he says, flipping on hisflashing lights and gunning his turbocharged Ford Mustang inpursuit of a car that has passed him at about 90 mph. &quot;See,we're doing 85, and he's still pulling away from us.&quot;   To be sure, slowing highway speeds, which was one of theoil-saving measures urged by the Bush administration soonafter the Mideast crisis began, wouldn't significantly alterthe U.S. energy picture. If everyone obeyed the speed limit,the nation's oil consumption would drop only about 0.3%.Still, obeying the speed limit has growing symbolic value asAmericans lay down their lives in the Mideast oil patch. Whatdo the I-93 speeders think about slowing down to save oil?   &quot;I never really thought about it,&quot; says Hugh Duffy, a21-year-old student hurrying home from college with his petschnauzer in the family Oldsmobile 88 when Mr. Powers clockshim at 81 mph and pulls him over. &quot;I don't think there's muchof an oil shortage. There's a lot of oil around the country.&quot;Furthermore, he says, &quot;we don't need Mideast oil.&quot;   Minutes later, Mr. Powers pulls over a fireman late forwork who is even more upbeat about the country's oilsituation. &quot;We don't have to save oil,&quot; he says. &quot;We haveenough in Texas and other places to keep us going.&quot;   Say what?   U.S. oil imports have soared 60% during the past fiveyears and, before the economic slump cut energy use lastyear, had risen to half of U.S. oil consumption -- a record,according to the American Petroleum Institute. Meantime, U.S.crude oil production fell for the fifth straight year in 1990to its lowest level since 1961, the institute says. DailyU.S. oil imports from the Persian Gulf have doubled since the1970s.   Not that America hasn't tried to cut back on its habit.Following the '70s oil shocks, the nation greatly improvedits energy efficiency via cars with higher fuel mileage,energy-saving appliances and other improvements. If all thathadn't been done, the U.S. would be using the energyequivalent of another 14.5 million barrels of oil a day now,according to the Worldwatch Institute, a Washington, D.C.,think tank. That's more than seven times as much as the U.S.imports from the Persian Gulf and about 50 times as much asAmerica could get daily by tapping the reserves beneathAlaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, Worldwatch says.   The gains are continuing on the electricity front. Spurredby new state rules to foster conservation, U.S. utilitiesrecently have committed an estimated $1 billion annuallythrough the end of the century to help their customers buyenergy-efficient fluorescent lighting and take other steps tosave power.   The nation's largest utility, Pacific Gas andamp; Electric Co.,which serves north and central California, plans to meet allof its increased demand for power during the next 10 yearswith efficiency programs and with &quot;renewable&quot; energy, such aswind and solar power. It foresees a 20% increase in demand,but no increase in use of fossil fuels. In fact, it hasreduced its dependence on oil 90% since the 1970s, withincreased use of natural gas, conservation and other energyforms. &quot;Essentially, PGandamp;E is getting off fossil fuels,&quot; saysRalph Cavanagh, an energy expert at the Natural ResourcesDefense Council, an environmental group based in Washington.   But utilities also have some headaches dealing with thesplit U.S. energy persona. After Central Maine Power Co.recently installed free insulation in one customer's attic,the customer asked that it be ripped out because it reducedhis storage space, says a Central Maine spokesman.   Utilities account for only about 4% of U.S. oil use, andtheir petroleum consumption has grown little in recent years.In contrast, 43% of the 17 million barrels of oil Americansuse daily winds up in cars, and gasoline consumption hasrisen about 20% since the early 1970s. That's a major reasonU.S. oil consumption has risen 13% since 1983.   Gasoline use is up chiefly because more drivers aretraveling in more cars to ever more distant suburbs. The onlything that really seems to affect people's use of oil isprice. Because of improved mileage and an ample supply ofoil, in inflation-corrected dollars, &quot;it costs less now todrive 100 miles than almost ever in our history,&quot; saysChristopher Flavin, an energy expert at the WorldwatchInstitute. &quot;We're living in a sort of dream world&quot; about oil,he figures.   One result: &quot;Cars are traveling remarkably faster thanback in the early 1970s,&quot; says Trooper Powers. Since theMideast crisis began, there has been &quot;no indication of aslowdown&quot; by U.S. drivers, adds Dennis Lee, a Federal HighwayAdministration official who helps compile speed data.   After making fuel-efficiency gains for years -- theaverage for U.S. cars has risen about 50% since 1973 -- carmakers recently have been backsliding, with consumers' help.The average miles per gallon of new automobiles sold in theU.S. has fallen about 4% in the past two years. Even Japaneseauto companies now are pushing speed: The fuel efficiency ofJapanese cars sold in the U.S. has been slipping faster thanthat of American-made models, according to the EnvironmentalProtection Agency.   U.S. auto makers strongly oppose higher fuel-efficiencystandards and last year helped block those proposed inCongress. Such rules, they argue, would result in smaller,flimsier automobiles that would crumple in collisions andincrease traffic fatalities. Proponents of the bill replythat strictly enforced speed limits, tougher drunk-drivinglaws and added safety features, such as airbags forpassengers, would make greater fuel efficiency possible withlittle increased risk.   But would Americans go for smaller, slower, costlier cars?Lisa Hahnen, another speeder nabbed by Trooper Powers, doubtsit. &quot;I don't think smaller cars are necessarily the answer,&quot;she says. &quot;I believe we should look for other sources of oil.We have a lot of oil reserves.&quot;   Ms. Hahnen, a 33-year-old mother who says she was hurryingto pick up her daughter after school, doesn't feel guiltyabout speeding -- even though she says, &quot;we are in theMideast strictly because of oil and because of our oildependence.&quot;   Ruefully noting that she forgot to turn on her policeradar detector, she confesses: &quot;I think I'm probably toospoiled at this point&quot; to use less oil. &quot;I don't think any ofus want to change our life styles.&quot;   ---                     Gasoline Guzzler                                                                                                          Countries ranked by per capita gasoline consumption                                     GASOLINE           GAS                                  CONSUMPTION         PRICE                          (Gallons per person  (Dollars per                                    per year)  gallon, 1988)                                                                                                          United States                      484           $0.95   Sweden                             221            2.81   West Germany                       206            2.18   Norway                             191            3.09   France                             180            3.04   Britain                            176            2.52   Austria                            176            2.67   Denmark                            172            3.67   Netherlands                        155            3.00   Italy                              148            3.90   Japan                              133            3.47                                                                                                          Source: World Resources Institute</TEXT></DOC>
