The build-up of particulates in the chamber is sensed,      and a valve opened at the bottom of the chamber when a pre-determined      level of the particulates is sensed in the chamber. A valve at the top of      the chamber may be closed at the same time so that pressurized air can be      injected into the chamber to expel the particulates through the bottom of      the chamber through the valve. A filter circuit may be connected to the      tundish to assist in removing particulates from the tundish. </PAL></ABST><BSUM> <PAR>  This invention relates to the collection of particulates and more      particularly, but not exclusively, to the collection of particulate      nuclear fuel. </PAR><PAR>  During the manufacture of nuclear fuel, for example uranium oxide fuel in      which pellets comprising uranium oxide are ground to size, particulate      residue needs to be collected so that it can be returned for further      processing. </PAR><PAR>  According to the present invention, a particulate collection apparatus      comprises a vessel having declivitous sides and a bottom outlet, a      collection chamber having an upper inlet communicable with the bottom      outlet and a lower outlet closable by a lower obturating means, and      sensing means for sensing an accumulation of particulates at a      predetermined level in the chamber. </PAR><PAR>  Preferably, upper obturating means are provided between the sensing means      and the bottom outlet, and air pressure means are provided between the      upper obturating means and the sensing means. </PAR><PAR>  Desirably, a filter circuit is connected to the vessel for passing liquid      in the vessel through a filter means, preferably a cross-flow filter      means. </PAR><PAR>  Advantageously, a particulate coating comprising U.sub.3 O.sub.8 is applied      to the ingress side of the cross-flow filter. In one application of the      invention, the apparatus is adapted to receive a liquid slurry from a      grinding apparatus, said liquid being recycled from the collection      apparatus to the grinding apparatus. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAR>  The invention will now be further described by way of example only with      reference to the accompanying drawings, in which: </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 1 shows a schematic representation of grinding and collection      apparatus in the manufacture of nuclear fuel; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 shows a schematic representation of a modified form of the apparatus      of FIG. 1, and </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 shows a fragmentary sectional representation of a filter element of      FIG. 2. </PAR><PAR>  In the above figures, like parts have like numerals. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAR>  Referring now to FIG. 1, a collection apparatus 10 is shown for collection      of particulates from a grinding apparatus 12. The collection apparatus 10      comprises a vessel 14 having declivitous sides 15 descending to an outlet      16 connected to one side of a top valve 17. A tubular upright collection      chamber 18 is connected at its upper end to the other side of the top      valve 17, and is closable at its lower end by a lower valve 22. An      ultrasonic sensor 24 is positioned just below the top valve 17 to monitor      particulate level at that position in the chamber 18, and a compressed air      inlet 25 into the chamber 18 locates between the sensor 24 and the top      valve 17. An overflow 26 extends near the top of the vessel 14, and a      recirculation circuit 28 including a pump 30 is connected between the      declivitous sides 15 to a position above the grinding apparatus 12. </PAR><PAR>  The grinding apparatus 12 comprises parallel grinding wheels 34, 35      respectively located above a trough 36 which has a bottom outlet 38      extending so as to discharge into the vessel 14. </PAR><PAR>  In operation, nuclear fuel pellets 40 (eg uranium oxide) are fed between      and along the grinding wheels 34, 35 to provide a required diameter of      pellet 40. The recirculation circuit 28 discharges water over the grinding      wheels 34, 35 and the water together with particulates 42 (eg 1 to 4      .mu.m) drop into the trough 36 and from there through the outlet 38 into      the vessel 14. With the top valve 17 open and the lower valve 22 closed,      the particulates 42 fall and settle in the chamber 18, whilst the water is      recirculated by the recirculation circuit 28, any water flowing through      the overflow 26 being collected and subsequently returned to the vessel      14. </PAR><PAR>  The particulates 42 gradually collect as a sludge 44 in the chamber 18      until they reach a level where they are detected by the sensor 24. The top      valve 17 is then closed, the lower valve 22 opened, and compressed air      introduced for a short period through the inlet 25 to eject the sludge 44      from the bottom of the chamber 18. The lower valve 22 is then closed, and      the top valve 17 opened, to repeat the collection cycle in the chamber 18. </PAR><PAR>  Referring now to the modification shown in FIG. 2, the collection apparatus      50 shown is in many respects identical to the collection apparatus 12 of      FIG. 1, except that in place of the recirculation circuit 28 of FIG. 1, a      filter circuit 52 is used. The filter circuit 52 comprises an outlet pipe      54 from the vessel 14 connected to a pump 56 arranged to discharge to a      conventional cross-flow filter 58. A clean water filtrate outlet 60 from      the filter 58 is arranged to discharge between the grinding wheels 34, 35,      whilst a through-flow outlet 62 from the filter 58 is returned into the      vessel 14 above the outlet pipe 54. As an option, a flush-down pipe 66      (shown in broken line) may be connected between the through-flow outlet 62      and the side of the trough 36 to assist in flushing the particulates 42      from the trough 36 into the vessel 14. </PAR><PAR>  In order to inhibit rapid blocking of the filter 58 from the particulate      42, an initial feed of particulate U.sub.3 O.sub.8 may be introduced at 68      to form a permeable coating 70 (see FIG. 3) at the ingress side of filter      element 72 of the filter 58. For example, particulate U.sub.3 .sub.8      having a size distribution of between 45 and 90 .mu.m at a loading of      about 229 gm in 30 liters of water mixed with U.sub.3 O.sub.8 having a      size distribution of 1andlt;45 .mu.m at a loading of about 50 gm in 30 liters      of water has been found suitable to provide an effective coating. </PAR><PAR>  An example of a suitable cross-flow filter 58 may be obtained from: </PAR><PA1>  Fairy Microfiltrex Limited </PA1><PA1>  Fareham Industrial Park </PA1><PA1>  Fareham </PA1><PA1>  Hampshire </PA1><PA1>  P016 8XO </PA1><PA1>  United Kingdom </PA1><PAR>  An example of a suitable sensor 24 to sense a sludge interface may be      obtained from: </PAR><PA1>  Bestobell Mobrey </PA1><PA1>  190-196 Bath Road </PA1><PA1>  Slough </PA1><PA1>  Berkshire </PA1><PA1>  SL1 4DN </PA1><PA1>  United Kingdom </PA1><PAR>  It will be appreciated that the sensor may form part of a circuit for      automatically operating the top valve 17, the lower valve 22, and the air      inlet 25 in response to signals from the sensor. With some particulates      and with frequent discharge of the sludge 44, the use of the air inlet 25      might be dispensed with. </PAR><PAR>  Although the invention has been described in relation to the manufacture of      nuclear oxide fuels, the invention has applications with alternative      nuclear fuels, and for non-nuclear materials. </PAR><PAR>  It will be understood that although obturating means in the form of valve      means (eg ball valve means) have been described in relation to FIGS. 1 and      2, alternative suitable obturating means may be used preferably to provide      a relatively clear axial path for the discharge of the sludge 44      therethrough. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  We claim: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
