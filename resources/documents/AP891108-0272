Broker Robert Chestman was convicted of charges related toinsider trading in a case experts say demonstrates the vagueness offederal securities laws.   Although small by the standards of other Ivan Boesky-eraprosecutions, the Waldbaum case sent a man to prison, caused turmoilin a well-known family business and raised issues possibly destinedfor the Supreme Court.   ``Factually, it's as straightforward as you could imagine,'' saidRobert L. Plotz, a former assistant U.S. attorney on the case. ``Itinvolved one tip in one instance and one set of trades and then apattern of coverup for several months afterward.''   Prosecutors say the case happened this way:   On the Friday before Thanksgiving in 1986, Waldbaum agreed tosell the grocery business founded by his grandfather in 1921 to theGreat Atlantic andamp; Pacific Tea Co. _ better known as Aandamp;P _ for $50 ashare, or $28.7 million.   The following Sunday, he told his sister, Shirley Witkin, aboutthe deal, stressing that the information had to remain confidentialuntil it was announced publicly.   Witkin went to a Long Island bank with one daughter to remove herWaldbaum stock certificates and later informed another daughter,Susan Loeb, who in turn told her husband, Keith.   Keith Loeb then told stockbroker Chestman, who bought 11,000shares of Waldbaum Inc. for about $25 each, making overnight profitsof $250,000 for himself and several clients, including Loeb.   The Securities and Exchange Commission, alerted to the trading byroutine post-merger stock market surveillance, filed civil charges.Loeb cooperated with investigators. Chestman was charged criminallyand convicted by a jury last March on 31 counts.   The Waldbaum case wasn't a big-money swindle. Keith Loeb, whowith his wife legitimately made $1.6 million on family shares fromthe Aandamp;P deal, earned $22,000 from the illicit trades, which occurredjust 12 days after Boesky admitted to the largest insider tradingring ever.   The case expanded securities law interpretation to encompassdisclosure of secrets down a lengthy chain of tipsters. No priorcriminal case had involved confidential information passed amongseveral family members.   At issue is whether confidentiality carries down from a corporateinner sanctum. Does a family member who works outside the companyhave any duty to the corporation? Does that duty transfer to anoutsider who profits from nonpublic information?   ``The problem here is information is inherently leaking,'' saidColumbia University law professor John C. Coffee Jr. ``At some pointit becomes a market rumor. This is in that zone where it is a littlebit more specific than a market rumor.''   Ira Waldbaum took over six Brooklyn grocery stores in 1947 afterhis father died, expanding Waldbaum into a 137-supermarket chain inNew York and New England. The family owned more than 60 percent whenWaldbaum was sold to Aandamp;P.   Testimony at the federal court trial in Manhattan last springrevealed that Waldbaum ran the company tightly but that the familywasn't particularly close. Waldbaum had trouble telling his twonieces apart and visited his 90-year-old mother just a few times ayear, testimony showed.   The business nonetheless was a family affair, so Waldbaum gotword out about the company's sale _ a legal disclosure undersecurities law. All family members were told to keep the informationsecret.   Loeb testified he called Chestman, a senior vice president atGruntal andamp; Co. and his broker since 1982, on the morning ofWednesday, Nov. 26. ``I told him that Waldbaum's is about to be soldand it would be substantially higher than it was currently tradingat,'' he said.   Loeb did not cite his source or say the information wasconfidential.   Brokerage records show Chestman bought 3,000 shares of Waldbaumstock for himself that day and 8,000 for Loeb and other clients, atprices ranging from $24.62{ to $26 a share.   The sale to Aandamp;P was announced after the close of the market. Bythe end of the next business day, Waldbaum stock had surged to $49 ashare.   Chestman denied talking to Loeb on Wednesday morning. The timingof Chestman's stock purchases, lawyers said, was a ``staggeringcoincidence.'' He bought the shares because Waldbaum trading volumewas high and the company was sound.   Loeb testified that shortly after the sale he became nervous andeven asked Chestman if he could rescind the trades. After learningof an SEC inquiry, Loeb admitted to lying to a Waldbaum lawyer aboutthe trades.   In April, the SEC showed Ira Waldbaum a list of buyers ofWaldbaum stock that Wednesday including Keith Loeb and JosephSierchio, another nephew by marriage. ``I would say I was rathersurprised,'' Waldbaum testified.   Loeb paid the SEC more than $45,000 in alleged illegal profitsand penalties. Sierchio, a New York securities lawyer, paid a totalof $123,000 and was not prosecuted.   Chestman's conviction hinged on whether Loeb had a duty to theWaldbaum company via the family and whether Chestman knew he wasbreaching it.   The government argued that Loeb had a duty to his wife, who had aduty to her mother, who had a duty to Ira Waldbaum, who had a dutyto the company. But Chestman attorney Elkan Abramowitz said:``That's too flimsy to be the basis for criminal action.''   ``There was no pre-existing relationship of trust and confidenceestablished beyond the fact that these people were related,''Abramowitz argued before the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appealsearlier this month.   But Assistant U.S. Attorney E. Scott Gilbert told the three-judgepanel that all family members were intertwined in a legal bond, andChestman knew it.   ``He's taking the rap for the breach of a family relationship,''Judge Roger Miner said in questioning Gilbert.   ``No, he's taking the rap, your honor, for taking stoleninformation and trading on it,'' Gilbert replied.   Chestman, 42, began serving a two-year sentence shortly afterconviction, rather than wait for the appeal to finish. He iseligible for parole from a minimum-security prison in Allenwood,Pa., in February. Civil charges are pending.   Abramowitz said his client, whose wife and three children live onLong Island, felt he couldn't get a job until the case was behindhim so he decided to serve time as soon as possible. He said theChestmans were devastated by the case.   ``I've never had anybody as affected by the criminal process asthis particular family was,'' Abramowitz said. ``Dreadful.''</TEXT><NOTE>End adv Monday Nov. 13</NOTE></DOC>
