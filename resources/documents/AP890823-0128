Duggan, the committee's chairman, inreleasing its latest annual report.   He pointed to figures issued two weeks ago by the President's PayAgent _ an interagency group involving officials of the LaborDepartment, Office of Personnel Management and Office of Managementand Budget _ showing that the pay gap has now grown to 28.6 percent.   Duggan said that ``we commend the president and Congress forgranting a 3.6 percent increase to become effective in January 1990,but the committee believes that an additional 6.4 percent isneeded.''   ``This would send a strong and clear message to young people, whowould not consider a public service career, that the government isserious about recruiting well-qualified people,'' he said in issuingthe report Tuesday.   Duggan added that ``the absence of adequate pay increases overthe past decade is driving out the capable people who are already inthe federal government.''   In addition to the pay raise recommendation, the panel's reportcalls for phasing in further increases to remove the pay gap over afour-year period; reforming the pay system by making salaries moreresponsive to labor market conditions; redesigning the health carebenefit program to provide more cost-efficient coverage; andupdating the government's benefits package to better compete forskills in the labor market.   Carol A. Bonosaro, president of the Senior ExecutivesAssociation, representing top career federal executives, called theadvisory committee's report ``right on target'' in urging the payincrease.   She noted that the pay gap tends to be greater at upper levels ofgovernment service, with GS-15s falling 36.7 percent behind theirprivate sector counterparts.   ``This is even more strong evidence that senior federalexecutives above that level are grossly undercompensated,'' Ms.Bonosaro said.   John N. Sturdivant, president of the American Federation ofGovernment Employees, AFL-CIO, commented that ``as a result of thecontinued imposition of pay caps, beginning in 1978, the federalgovernment has found itself in an untenable position, with inferior,non-competitive salaries in a nationally tight labor market.''   ``Failure to begin to remedy the current pay gap will virtuallyensure that the nation's largest employer will remain the employerof last resort,'' Sturdivant said.   AFGE is the largest union for government workers, representing700,000 federal employees in the United States and overseas.</TEXT></DOC>
