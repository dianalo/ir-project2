The effectand reasons for the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act removal ofmany of the disincentives of cogeneration are discussed. The relativeefficiencies of conventional and combined-cycle cogeneration power plantsare compared in a typical example of a large cogeneration power plantcurrently under construction. Many considerations face the electricalengineer in the design of a cogeneration power plant. Many applicationswill be found in industrial plants and will utilize industrial thinkingwithin the plant; however, many decisions will be influenced by conventionalelectric utility thinking, due to the interface with the electric utilityin the switchyard. Basic discussion of the considerations required ofthe electrical engineer, including electrical system arrangement, integrationof the new generation into the plant electrical system, short-circuitmatters, one-line diagrams, generator characteristics, excitation systems,step-up transformer ratings and characteristics, auxiliary transformers(station service), distribution systems, and system grounding, is givenfor preliminary guidance in design.</TEXT></DOC>
