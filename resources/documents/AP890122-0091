Thousands of abortion protesters marched in St. Paul, Minn.,Little Rock, Ark., Allentown, Pa., Boston, Bismarck, N.D., andBurlington, Vt., while large pro-choice rallies were held inPittsburgh, Los Angeles and Seattle.   In Little Rock, Asa Hutchinson, a lawyer and former federalprosecutor, told a crowd of several thousand people that the ``tideis changing'' toward reversal of Roe vs. Wade.   ``Change in direction is brought about by citizens at thegrassroots level,'' Hutchinson said.   An estimated 4,500 abortion protesters marched in St. Paul to thestatehouse. There were no arrests.   In downtown Pittsburgh, about 1,200 banner-carrying marchersjoined the March For Women's Lives. They were met at the AlleghenyCounty morgue by about 40 anti-abortion marchers.   The pro-choice march was preceded by a rally at which EleanorSmeal, a former National Organization for Women president, said,``Some people want to save their souls by spilling the blood ofinnocent women. That isn't Christianity. It's hypocrisy. The churchhas no business dictating the policies of this country.''   After her remarks, many in the crowd turned, shook their fingersand yelled, ``Shame, shame, shame'' at the anti-abortion protesters,who stood across the street.   About 500 women attending a Feminist Super Bowl Rally for Choicein Los Angeles vowed to continue supporting a woman's right toabortion. And in Seattle, about 500 pro-choice demonstratorsattended a candlelight rally in front of the federal courthouse.   In Philadelphia, about 30 pro-choice demonstrators held acandlelight vigil Sunday night in front of Independence Hall, wherethe U.S. Constitution was signed.   Organizers said the vigil emphasized that the freedom to have alegal abortion may be in jeopardy because of the Supreme Court'sdecision to review a Missouri law that declares life begins atconception.   Sue Elentrio, a board member of the Philadelphia chapter of theNational Abortion Rights Action League, said the small turnout wasreflective of the timing of the vigil, not concern over the issue.   ``They're (women) all home making snacks for their husbandsbecause it's Super Bowl Sunday,'' she said.   In San Francisco, about 200 pro-choice protesters chanted duringa march, ``No back alleys in the night, for safe abortion we willfight.''   Several pro-choice groups and abortion protesters cameface-to-face.   At the offices of Planned Parenthood of Northern New England inBurlington, Vt., more than 500 opponents of abortion were met by 40pro-choice demonstrators.   The two sides faced each other from across the street, with eachgroup singing, clapping and maintaining their distance. There wereno arrests.   ``Right-to-life is not a political issue,'' said Bishop JohnMarshall, the leader of Vermont's Catholic diocese. ``It has nothingto do with politics. It is a religious and moral question. It is nota matter for the politicians to decide. It is a religious and moralissue already decided by God.''   More than 500 people crowded Boston's Faneuil Hall to hearCardinal Bernard Law lead a rally against abortion. Mayor Raymond L.Flynn read a proclamation declaring Sunday ``Respect for Life Day''in Boston.   Outside Faneuil Hall, a small group of pro-choice protesterschanting and carrying signs led by longtime pro-abortion activistBill Baird picketed the building.   ``I warn you now we are in danger of losing the abortion law,''Baird said.   Washington state pro-choice activists, who plan to collect 10,000signatures in support of abortion rights, urged people to getinvolved.   ``The right to choose is under severe attack from the Bushadministration, the change in the Supreme Court and from anti-choiceextremists. Now more than ever the pro-choice majority has to showitself,'' said Esther Herst, executive director of the NationalAbortion Rights Action League in Washington   Thousands of people were expected in Washington, D.C., on Mondayfor a protest organized by March for Life. Leonard Dinegar of theNational Right to Life Committee said organizers hope to match lastyear's turnout, when police estimated that 50,000 people marched.   President Bush is scheduled to speak by telephone to the march.</TEXT></DOC>
