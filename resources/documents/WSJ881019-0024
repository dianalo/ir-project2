A nationwide labor strike in Peru was a major factor in the price rise.    The spot October delivery closed at the high of the day, $1.38 a pound, up 3.90 cents. December copper advanced to as high as $1.2830 before settling at $1.2780, a gain of 3.20 cents.    The New York market opened lower, partly because of carry-over selling from Monday, said Bernard Savaiko, senior metals analyst for PaineWebber Inc., New York. He said other depressants include the fact that copper futures prices on the London Metal Exchange declined in sympathy with lower aluminum prices there and contracts sold by Japanese trading firms.    The Japanese firms' selling was a tactical maneuver rather than an indication of their long-term price outlook, another analyst said. &quot;They do it to cool off the market, so to speak, because they need the copper and when they're buying they find themselves chasing the market upward,&quot; he said. &quot;The Chinese do it from time to time, too.&quot;    Analysts agreed that Monday's decline and early weakness in New York yesterday was a &quot;shakeout of weak longs&quot; -- that is, selling by traders who previously bought contracts and were nervous about the market's continuous advance to near-record levels.    Mr. Savaiko noted that, as of the beginning of trading yesterday, the open interest, or number of contracts that remain to be offset either by delivery of the commodity or an opposite trade, declined by 688 to 34,771. The heaviest liquidation, 700 contracts, was in the December contract, he said.    &quot;That's evidence that traders were getting out of the market along with new short selling of contracts,&quot; Mr. Savaiko said.    Ben Hanauer, a broker at Rudolf Wolff andamp; Co., Inc., a New York trading and brokerage firm, said that as the December contract dropped below $1.23 a pound, active selling of contracts that had been expected when the price fell beneath that level didn't materialize. Only a few contracts were sold, helping to push the price as low as $1.2270. At that point, strong demand developed, instead, and drove prices to life-of-contract highs, he said.    &quot;Technically, because the December contract closed near the high of the day and above the old life-of-contract high there is the expectation that prices will now move into the $1.35 to $1.40 area,&quot; Mr. Hanauer said. &quot;It wouldn't surprise me at all to see the December price rise to $1.40 before it expires,&quot; he said.    The latest market-supporting development was the labor strike in Peru that was described as &quot;indefinite&quot; by news wire services. According to Knight-Ridder Inc. Peruvian mines were affected by the walkout, which began Monday.    The report said that, according to Guillermo Diaz, a mining and metalworkers' federation official in Lima, all metal unions at Southern Peru Copper Corporation's Toquepala and Cuajone mines plus the company's Ilo smelter joined the strike.    The report said according to Mr. Diaz, almost all workers at Centromin, the central Peruvian state mining complex, with the exception of workers at La Oroya, had joined the strike. A number of other mines also were affected, the report said.    A spokesman for the state minerals marketing agency, MINPECO, however, estimated that only about half of Peru's 70,000 miners were out on strike, according to the report.    Peru, the world's sixth-largest copper producer, also had a month-long strike in July and August (which is still affecting the market), and had other work stoppages earlier in the year.    According to Fred Demler, metals economist for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., New York, dealer premiums for immediate delivery continue to be high, global stocks of copper are still declining and world-wide consumption during the third quarter is expected to have increased 1% from the year-earlier period.    World-wide inventories of copper currently are estimated at a record low of about 3.1 weeks' consumption -- about the same level as on Dec. 31, 1987, when the copper futures price hit a record $1.46 a pound, Mr. Demler said.    In addition, he noted, projections of copper consumption needs in Japan have been increased sharply. At the beginning of the year it was forecast that consumption of copper in Japan would rise about 1% to 2% this year over last year, he said.    &quot;It is now anticipated that Japanese wire mill usage of copper will rise 2% to 3% over last year and by 5% to 6% for brass mills,&quot; Mr. Demler said.    &quot;There is also a severe tightness of copper in the U.S. and last week when copper people from all over the world congregated in London for the London Metal Exchange copper dinner and many other related functions, there were reports that some U.S. producers were seeking to buy copper to meet commitments,&quot; Mr. Demler said.    In other commodity markets yesterday:   COCOA: Futures prices closed strong after early weakness. December delivery cocoa ended at $1,341, up $23 a metric ton. Prices opened easier but turned higher on rumors of an agreement between a French trade firm and the Ivory Coast, the world's top cocoa producer, to take a large quantity of cocoa off the market to support prices. According to one analyst, Monday's rumors said the arrangement would involve 200,000 metric tons of cocoa beans. Yesterday, he said, that amount was raised to 400,000 tons. A metric ton is equal to 1.1 U.S. short tons, or 2,204.6 pounds. There has been no confirmation of the arrangement, the analyst noted, but it prompted traders to buy futures contracts. &quot;I think it's a little far-fetched,&quot; he said of the rumor.    COTTON: Futures prices fell sharply. December delivery cotton ended 1.46 cents a pound lower at 53.64 cents. According to one analyst, there has been no change in fundamentals and the market was moving largely on technical considerations. On Friday the December contract traded above 56 cents but failed to hold its gains. This weakness triggered selling among technically oriented traders that continued on Monday and yesterday, he said.    LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: Profit-taking hurt cattle futures prices. Interest in buying cattle contracts at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange evaporated amid growing speculation that the premium of the cattle contract for December delivery had gotten too far above the spot price of live cattle, said Thomas Morgan, president of Sterling Research Corp., Arlington Heights, Ill. Cattle futures prices have rallied for much of this month on speculation that the number of young cattle placed on feedlots for fattening for slaughter is shrinking, which would tend to boost spot prices through autumn. During trading Monday, the prices of several futures contracts set life-of-contract highs before settling lower. After the close of trading Friday, analysts expect the Agriculture Department's Oct. 1 census of 13 major cattle-producing states to show 5% to 6% fewer feedlot cattle than the Oct. 1, 1987 count. </TEXT></DOC>
