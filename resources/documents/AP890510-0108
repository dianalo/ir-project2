Daily News-Sun on the federal budget agreement:   President Bush describes the budget agreement he reachedrecently with congressional leaders as ``a first manageable step''toward solving the nation's deficit problem.   What he and congressional leaders don't say is that the step wasmanageable only because it was so small.   Although the accord nominally meets the 1990 Gramm-Rudmandeficit target, it does so through the use of rosy scenarios andaccounting flimflam, leaving the real deficit virtually untouched.   By now, the devices of budget fudging are drearily familiar.Faced with the task of reducing the deficit from $163 billion, theestimate for the current year, to the required $100 billion, thenegotiators first agreed to assume that the economy will growfaster, with lower inflation and interest rates, than any privateforecaster dares predict. That cut the problem in half.   Then came the usual accounting evasions: Assume $500 million innew revenues from unspecified Internal Revenue Service actions;``save'' $2.2 billion in postal spending by moving the PostalService off budget; ``cut'' farm support programs by $900 millionby making October payments to farmers in September, a move thatsaves taxpayers no money but shifts the spending out of the comingbudget year onto this year's account; require changes in law thatwill yield $5.3 billion in new revenue without being viewed as newtaxes.   Using this smoke and mirrors technique, Congress and thepresident will pretend to have done their job.</TEXT><TEXT>   May 7   Dallas Times Herald on the FSX deal:   President Bush's decision to proceed with the co-development ofthe FSX fighter for the Japanese air force may be economicallysound in the short term.   But it's difficult to justify the deal on a long-term basis,because it gives Japan commercial and military technology it hasbeen unable to develop and which it will use to build a competitiveaerospace industry. ...   Bush was right to discard some aspects of the deal set byPresident Reagan, and to ensure that U.S. firms receive at least 40percent of the production revenues. But that does not correct thebasic flaw in the transaction _ providing crucial technology toassist Japan in developing a competing industry.   Congress should reject this pact and let Japan try to competealone. ...   There are three drawbacks:   _ The agreement ... is not binding like a contract or a treaty.Development of the FSX will not necessarily provide jobs. ...   _ The administration is providing the Japanese with the basicsource codes for the craft's armaments system, though the Japanesewill have to develop their own high performance weapons andinterlocking operational software. This is excessively generous. ...   _ Bush asserts U.S. firms will share in the development ofphased-array radar systems and high-performance composite wingmaterial. What he overlooks is the Japanese do not have theseitems. The radar is the domain of Texas Instruments, E-Systems andother U.S. firms. And the aircraft giants such as GD, Lockheed, andMcDonnell-Douglass pioneered composites.   It's not likely the Japanese, in the next decade, can surpassthe existing lead of U.S. firms and the advances they are sure todevelop. So there will be no Japanese gains in which American firmsreasonably can share.   Aviation experts do not believe the Japanese can create theworld's most demanding technological machines in the next decade.For that reason, it would be preferable to let the Japanese go italone rather than provide the tools to boost them to the top.</TEXT><TEXT>   May 5   Independent, Marshall, Minn., on new ethics legislation:   The Integrity in Post-Employment Act of 1989 has been introducedin Congress by Rep. Craig T. James, R-Fla.   It is a good bill, designed to help restore integrity andhonesty to service in Congress and throughout the federalgovernment. It should sail through Congress, but probably won't.   The honor that once graced government service no longer exists,disappearing in a pattern of abuse by public officials at everylevel. The problems are rampant and have been festering for years.Elected officials have lost their commitment to the values ofhonesty and integrity and accountability.   Significant changes in current federal laws will be required tocorrect the present flawed system of ethics. Dishonest andunethical behavior cannot be legislated away, of course, but lawscan be put into place that would close the potential avenues ofcorruption as well as severely punish those who are corrupt.   James' legislation would do that. The essence of his proposal issimple: It establishes an equality of ethical rules for allbranches of government. For far too long, Congress has demandedhigh ethical standards from others while exempting itself from eventhe most perfunctory ones.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
