Advanced Telemarketing Corp., a closely held Irving, Texas-based concern, filed the suit in U.S. District Court in Dallas. The suit seeks more than $11.4 million in damages from Consolidated, a Columbus, Ohio-based retailer.    John A. Gabelman, secretary of Consolidated Stores, said the suit is &quot;unjustified and without merit.&quot;    The suit says that Consolidated signed a one-year contract to purchase a service in which customers could order Consolidated merchandise by phone. The contract expires Oct. 1, but Consolidated abruptly told Advanced to end the service Jan. 5, according to the suit.    The suit accuses Consolidated of breach of contract, fraud and malicious interference with Advanced's business. Advanced said in the suit that Consolidated refused to pay more than $600,000 it owes for phone services since last October. Advanced also claims that it stands to lose at least $750,000 in future profits from the unexpired portion of the contract with Consolidated. </TEXT></DOC>
