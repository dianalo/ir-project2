In maneuvers ofunsurpassed skill, it singlehandedly cripples six U.S.submarines. Captain Umieda, its commander, declares as hisgoal &quot;a war for independence&quot; from U.S. domination.   &quot;Japan hasn't changed a bit since Pearl Harbor,&quot; snarlsthe commander of the defeated American fleet.   Sound far-fetched? It's the plot of a comic book called&quot;Silent Fleet,&quot; read today by a quarter-million youngJapanese. The story is pure fantasy, but it is rooted insentiments spreading rapidly through the popular culture ofboth countries.   The underlying message: Something is seriously askew inU.S.-Japan relations.   The two nations, of course, remain fast allies, and witheach passing year their interests become more closely alignedand their economies more thoroughly intertwined. But witheach year mutual resentment grows as well.   Trade disputes are the most visible sign of the problem,though those disputes are mere surface ripples. Strongundercurrents of fear and distrust are flowing through thenational psyches. In the U.S., people worry that Japan'srising economic power is threatening America's futureprosperity and its place in the world. Across the ocean, theJapanese are torn between pride in their new affluence andfear that foreign resentment could leave them isolated in anunfriendly world.   &quot;There seems to be a race,&quot; says James C. Abegglen, alongtime business consultant in Japan, &quot;between economicinterdependence and political and social antagonism.&quot;   In the past year, that race has become even more intense.Trade talks between the two nations have evolved into anextraordinary series of negotiations in which each side iscriticizing the other's internal economic affairs. At thesame time, the political glue that has bound the two allies-- fear of the Soviet Union -- has been weakened bycommunism's new travails. In both countries, some people arenow questioning the very basis of the alliance.   Is Japan really a threat to the United States? Does itsrapid rise in economic power mean America is on the decline?And do the Japanese have reason to worry that a resentfulU.S. will turn against them?   These are questions The Wall Street Journal has beenexploring since the first of this year, in interviews withhundreds of people ranging from top business and governmentleaders on both sides of the Pacific to ranchers in Nebraskaand Judo students in Kyoto. The result is a series ofarticles, beginning today.   The anxiety in America is strikingly demonstrated in a newWall Street Journal/NBC poll, which shows that while 63% ofAmerican voters say it is &quot;very important&quot; for the U.S. to bethe leading economic power in the world, 69% believe Japanhas already passed the U.S. Fully 63% say the Japanese haveleaped ahead in science and technology, and 69% feel Japaninvests &quot;too much&quot; in the United States.   Meanwhile, in a separate poll conducted for the Journal inJapan, 43% of Japanese say it's time for their government todevelop a foreign policy more independent of the U.S. Only17% oppose such a move.   In the years since World War II, Americans have grownaccustomed to the idea of being at the top, and they don'twant to give it up. Virtually all Americans &quot;feel they haveto be the leader of the world,&quot; contends Mitsuko Shimomura, aJapanese journalist who recently did an extensive tour of theU.S. &quot;They are like missionaries. They really believe thereis nothing better than America in this world.&quot;   The Bush administration's budget director, Richard Darman,agrees. &quot;If Americans aren't No. 1,&quot; he says, &quot;forget it.&quot;   In the end, relations between great nations come down torelations between human beings. For an understanding of whereU.S.-Japan relations have come from and where they may beheaded, here are six conversations with people at theforefront of dealings between the two countries.                                                                                                          Mitsuya Goto: The Vanquished   It was May of 1945, and young Mitsuya Goto sat wide-eyedon the roof of his ancestral home in Nagoya as more than 500B-29 bombers roared overhead. Most of the city's inhabitantshad scrambled into air-raid shelters, but the young Goto satentranced by the awesome sight.   &quot;I wasn't afraid,&quot; he recalls. &quot;I could see the faces ofthe pilots, and I was very impressed. I felt the strength andthe power of the U.S., and the industrial might of a countrythat could deploy so many B-29 bombers. I wasn't mad at theU.S. I was mad at the Japanese government. I said aloud: `MyGod, what have we done?'&quot;   In the years that followed, Mr. Goto came to embody thepostwar attitudes of many Japanese: He was awed by thesuperior power of the U.S. and, despite the war'sdestruction, embraced his nation's former enemy.   The young Goto worked on his family's farm in Nagoya, buthe rushed home each evening to listen to Armed Forces Radio,eagerly mimicking the words of the GI announcers. When hisEnglish was good enough, he applied for a job as a translatorwith Gen. Douglas MacArthur's occupation forces. And when themother of an American friend offered him a chance to study inthe U.S. he jumped at it, earning a degree from WabashCollege in Crawfordsville, Ind. His commencement speechfocused on the image of a frog in a well. &quot;The frog in thewell,&quot; he explains, &quot;doesn't know the existence of greatoceans.&quot;   The quiet, slender man crossed the great oceans many timesover the next forty years, first as a delegate to theInternational Labor Organization and then as a specialassistant to the chairman of Nissan Motors. He became one ofJapan's rare breed of &quot;internationalists,&quot; working tosolidify friendships with his country's conquerors. Hisgeneration, he explains, &quot;is still fascinated by Americans.We remember how generous Americans have been.&quot;   But in recent years, as managing director of the JapanCenter for International Exchange, Mr. Goto has watchedattitudes between the two countries take a disturbing turn.Especially worrisome, he says, is the younger generation ofJapanese, which didn't see the sky-darkening hordes ofbombers overhead. &quot;Some Japanese have become a bit arrogant,&quot;he says. &quot;I don't like it. The Japanese need to understandthe kind of problems that America has that Japan doesn't.&quot;   There is little alternative, he believes. &quot;We have so muchat stake. We have to remain partners.&quot;   If Mitsuya Goto is the face Japan showed to the U.S. afterWorld War II, then Edwin Reischauer is the face the U.S.showed to Japan.   Born and reared in Japan and married to a Japanese woman,Mr. Reischauer has lived a life between two cultures. Afterstarting a Japanese-studies program at Harvard University, hewas named ambassador to Japan by President Kennedy and servedfive years in the post. Today, sitting in his retirement homein San Diego next to a picture of Mount Fuji, he can recitechapter and verse the major U.S.-Japan scuffles of thepostwar years.   &quot;The first&quot; he recalls, &quot;was the one surrounding thesecurity treaty of 1960.&quot; A residue of harsh feelings fromthe war led many Japanese to oppose their country's decisionto form a close military alliance with the U.S. In 1964, onedissident even attacked Ambassador Reischauer, driving aknife into his leg. But the security treaty, which wasdesigned to counter the spread of communism, became a firmbond that held the two countries together for three decades.   Today, Mr. Reischauer argues, the decline of the Sovietempire is one reason U.S.-Japan relations have becomestrained: The common threat is gone. &quot;You unfortunately findsome people have to have an enemy,&quot; he says. &quot;We lost theSoviet Union, so people got excited about the economiccompetition&quot; with Japan. For the first time, he says,relations between the two countries are &quot;getting close towhat you might call a crisis.&quot;   Mr. Reischauer's bicultural background gives him anunusual understanding of the problems Japanese have indealing with the West. There is, for example, Japan'sattention to hierarchy, which leads Japanese to think ofthemselves as either subservient or superior to others. &quot;TheJapanese jump immediately from Pax Americana to PaxNipponica,&quot; he says.   But he puts most of the blame on the U.S. &quot;We've allowedour industrial skills not to improve as much as we should,&quot;he says. &quot;We are in danger of becoming a second, a thirdworld country.   &quot;Cleaning up our own problems,&quot; he adds, &quot;would be thequickest way to foster good relations with Japan.&quot;                                                                                                          Wataru Hiraizumi: Newly Confident                                                                                                          &quot;When you look back at what the 20th century was allabout,&quot; says Wataru Hiraizumi, slowly sucking on a piece ofSwiss candy, &quot;the big problem was not the cold war, but thequestion of Germany, Japan and the U.S.&quot; And the biggestproblem of the three, he makes clear, is the U.S. &quot;Peopledon't realize how dangerous the U.S. can be.&quot;   Born in 1929, Mr. Hiraizumi is the son of KiyoshiHiraizumi, a professor of Japanese history who, before thewar, was a passionate nationalist and a believer in thesuperiority of Japanese culture. The younger man shared hisfather's intellectual pursuits. Now a member of the NationalDiet and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, he sits in themidst of a huge library with titles in Japanese, French,English and German.   As he speaks, Mr. Hiraizumi pulls an occasional book offthe shelf, such as a 1937 work called &quot;Forty Years ofAmerican-Japanese Relations,&quot; which documents &quot;the decline ofAmerican influence and prestige in the Far East before therelentless growth of Japanese political and economic power.&quot;   Most political leaders in Japan try to avoid offendingforeign visitors, but Mr. Hiraizumi enjoys being provocative.&quot;The U.S. is very difficult to deal with,&quot; he explains. &quot;Itis an artificial creation. It was created by people who lefttheir country to create the best nation in the world. Youconsider yourselves superior.&quot;   After a pause, he grins and adds: &quot;You have to consideryourself the best. Otherwise, why don't you go back to Italy?   &quot;The original sin of your culture is your cult ofindividuality. It means you cherish `A' people. But theimportant thing is how to organize and discipline and educate`B,' `C,' `D,' `E' and `F' people. You value A people; wevalue B, C, D, E and F people. Who wins?&quot; he asks, and with asmile suggests the answer.   Nevertheless, Mr. Hiraizumi believes Japan should becareful about flexing its muscle and assuming the mantle ofworld leadership. &quot;Americans can become very wicked. Youshould always try not to anger them,&quot; he says.                                                                                                          Robert Mosbacher: Trade Warrior                                                                                                          A needlepoint pillow that used to sit on the sofa inCommerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher's office read: &quot;Happinessis Being an American.&quot; Lately, he has replaced it with oneslightly less offensive to his foreign guests: &quot;Free TradeAvenue is a Two-Way Street.&quot;   Mr. Mosbacher is an American -- no apologies. He is alsothe Bush administration's leading trade hawk. It is Mr.Mosbacher who argued in April, unsuccessfully, that the U.S.should once again cite Japan for unfair actions under theTrade Reform Act. And it is Mr. Mosbacher who has tried, withonly limited success, to get Washington to provide more aidto industries fighting Japanese competition.   &quot;I think the American people are just about filled to thetop with this feeling they've been had,&quot; he says.   When he talks about relations with Japan, the commercesecretary uses the term &quot;economic security&quot; as if the nationwere under siege. He happily admits to his desire to seeAmerica remain No. 1. &quot;You could be No. 2 or 3 and losecontrol over your economic and possibly military security,&quot;he says. A picture on one wall shows him standing between twoSumo wrestlers. Nearby hangs a plaque with a quote itattributes to Vince Lombardi, the legendary football coach:&quot;Winning is not a sometime thing, it's an all-time thing.&quot;   On at least one occasion the White House has taken him totask for his hardline views. In response he has learned totoe the adminstration's line, and even express support forSecretary of State James Baker's proposal for a &quot;globalpartnership&quot; with Japan. But he repeatedly returns to theidea that Japan is unfair. &quot;You can't be allies,&quot; he says,&quot;with somebody you think is getting to you.&quot;                                                                                                          Shunji Taoka: Taking Offense                                                                                                          Mr. Taoka, gaunt-faced writer and editor for the popularJapanese magazine Aera, sits in a coffee shop in Tokyo andspins out the following scenario:   &quot;It is the year 2000. Total American overseas debt is morethan $2 trillion. Annual interest payments are $160 billion,far exceeding today's trade deficit. The U.S. faces twosolutions. It can default on its debt. Or it can print moredollars and create inflation.   &quot;America decides to default. In response, Japan and othercountries refuse to lend any more to the U.S. So, in theAmerican tradition, your nation loads up its guns, jumps onits horse, and heads for the bank.&quot; Translation: The U.S.invades Japan.   Mr. Taoka is quick to say he doesn't believe thelikelihood of such an invasion is high. But he clearly placesit in the realm of possibility.   &quot;This year is the 30th year of the U.S.-Japan securitytreaty,&quot; he explains. &quot;There have been three radicaldevelopments in this 30th year.&quot; The first is the change inU.S.-Soviet relations. The second is America's soaringfederal debt and the resulting pressure for defense cuts. Andthe third is &quot;rising anti-Japan feeling as a result ofJapanese economic power.&quot;   Together, he argues, these three changes have cut thefoundation out from under the U.S.-Japan security alliance.   On the coffee shop table, Mr. Taoka lays a copy of thelatest issue of his magazine. The cover story quotes MajorGeneral Henry C. Stackpole, a Marine divisional commander inOkinawa, as saying that if the U.S. cuts back its forces inthe Pacific, Japan will beef up &quot;what is already a very, verypotent military.&quot; The U.S. forces, he said, &quot;are a cap on thebottle.&quot;   Mr. Taoka finds the &quot;cap on the bottle&quot; image -- and otherrecent suggestions that Japanese power needs to be&quot;contained&quot; -- insulting. &quot;It's like giving a room of yourhouse to a friend who asks for food, and then money, and thenfinally goes to your neighbors and says, `My landlord is astrange person. I'd better stick around and keep an eye onhim.'&quot;   Yet for all his resentment of American attitudes, Mr.Taoka says he, too, is not yet ready for Japan to chart acourse that is independent of the U.S. &quot;It's not necessaryfor Japan to become a superpower,&quot; he says. &quot;What is thebenefit? Somebody who is satisfied as head of the Chamber ofCommerce doesn't need to become mayor.&quot;                                                                                                          Harry Lonsdale: No Colonization                                                                                                          &quot;My hot button is trees,&quot; says Harry Lonsdale, eatingsalmon in a 30th-floor restaurant overlooking the city ofPortland. &quot;I think we have to preserve our forests.&quot; Hisproposal for doing that: Stop exporting logs to Japan.   Flying over Oregon, it's easy to understand why Mr.Lonsdale feels so strongly. The mountainous state looks likea patchwork quilt from the air, scarred by rectangular andtrapezoidal bare spots -- the work of loggers. Roughly aquarter of this timber is exported, mostly to Japan.   Mr. Lonsdale is a candidate for the U.S. Senate,challenging incumbent Mark Hatfield. As an environmentalist,he has opposed cutting trees. But as a politician, he has hadto consider as well the interests of the state's lumberindustry.   At a time when the U.S. trade deficit with Japan is stillrunning at $50 billion a year, stopping any U.S. export toJapan may seem foolhardy. But Mr. Lonsdale has caught on to afundamental truth: It's not just whether the U.S. exportsthat matters, but what it exports. &quot;Exporting raw materials,&quot;he says, &quot;is a third-world task.&quot; Or worse, the task of acolony.   If he could force the Japanese to buy finished wood andlumber products rather than logs, Mr. Lonsdale figures hecould create more jobs and destroy fewer trees. &quot;In 1980,Indonesia was shipping raw logs to Japan, and in additionproviding only 1% of Japan's plywood,&quot; he notes. &quot;Now theyprohibit raw log exports, and they're shipping 18% of Japan'splywood.&quot;   Mr. Lonsdale's fears about losing pre-eminence to Japanrecall a prediction made by the late Shigeru Yoshida, who wasJapan's prime minister from 1946 to 1954 and who signed thesecurity treaty giving the U.S. rights to bases in Japan. Atthe time, critics said Mr. Yoshida was going to make Japan acolony of the U.S. But he took a longer-term view.   &quot;Just as the United States was once a colony of GreatBritain but is now the stronger of the two,&quot; he said, &quot;ifJapan becomes a colony of the United States, it will alsoeventually become the stronger.&quot;   ---                     Public Perceptions                                                                                                                                           U.S.           JAPANESE                                 RESPONSES         RESPONSES                                                                                                        Which country has the strongest overall economy?
