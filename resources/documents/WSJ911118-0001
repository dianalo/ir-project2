Competitors, perhaps anxious about the newfound strengthMcDonnell Douglas would have if it pulls off the deal, saythey're dubious about the move. U.S. lawmakers, while fearingthe transfer of American technology, say the proposal isreally a sign of trouble at home.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;It's very worrisome to confront these facts and see oneof our real stars possibly leaving the United States to thisextent,&quot; said House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, ahard-liner on the transfer overseas of jobs and know-how.   But the Democrat from Missouri, where McDonnell Douglas isheadquartered and is one of the state's largest employers,said he spoke with Chairman John McDonnell about thepossibility several weeks ago, and doesn't blame the company.&quot;This is the only thing they can do if they want to stay inthe business,&quot; Rep. Gephardt said. He called for the U.S. toadopt &quot;a more sensible trade and industrial policy&quot; thatwould pry open world markets and keep U.S. companies frombeing forced to look abroad for assistance.   The White House hadn't any immediate comment.   Following reports in The Wall Street Journal, bothMcDonnell Douglas and Taiwan Aerospace confirmed Friday thatthe Taiwanese are thinking of taking as much as a 40% equitystake in McDonnell Douglas's commercial operations for up to$2 billion. Although a final accord may be months away, apreliminary pact could be reached much sooner, industryofficials say.   Yet it's clear that Taiwan Aerospace, officially formedlast month by the private sector and the government, won't berushed.   In an interview in Taipei, Taiwan Aerospace PresidentDenny Ko said that while the $2 billion figure has beenkicked around, the two sides have mulled &quot;all kinds ofnumbers.&quot; He said &quot;many, many drafts&quot; of potential agreementshave been drawn up. Mr. Ko added that a variety ofarrangements are under consideration, including the equitystake, risk-sharing subcontracting and co-production.   A figure of $2 billion can be interpreted as &quot;an askingprice&quot; from St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas, Mr. Ko said.&quot;You can ask a price for a house, but as a buyer that doesn'tmean I'm going to pay that amount.&quot;   In the end, many observers believe that neither side canafford to let this opportunity pass.   McDonnell Douglas needs a cash infusion as part of the $4billion it will cost to launch its new wide-body airliner,the MD-12. It needs the plane to survive long term as one ofthe world's three big jetliner makers. An Asian deal &quot;couldtake them from the poorhouse to the palace,&quot; said HowardRubel, an analyst for C.J. Lawrence Inc.   Although Taiwan Aerospace is run by cautious businessmen,the Taiwan government, which is determined to have anindigenous aircraft-making capability, has two officials onthe company's board. Taiwan Aerospace's chairman, DavidHuang, once served as the president of the Tawian military'sweapons-research lab and now is an adviser to Prime MinisterHau Pei-tsun.   The prime minister and President Lee Teng-hui are said tobe strong supporters of an equity deal. &quot;We can continue togo back to government-related banks or institutions&quot; forfinancial help if a proposed project is attractive, Mr. Konoted.   A deal with Taiwan Aerospace would be but the first piecein a trans-Pacific consortium McDonnell Douglas hopes toform. Ultimately, as much as 49% of the company's commercialaircraft business could be acquired by foreign investors,including entities in Singapore, Korea, Japan and perhapsIndonesia. According to Japanese wire reports, Mitsui andamp; Co.,which has had a long relationship with McDonnell Douglas, hasexpressed an interest in some sort of stake of its own.   McDonnell Douglas executives emphasized that the companywill hold back sharing any of the crucial design engineering-- as distinct from manufacturing techniques -- that couldturn partners into eventual competitors.   Still, rivals question striking an agreement with Taiwan-- and not only because of trade issues. Lawrence Clarkson, asenior vice president at Boeing Co.'s commercial aircraftunit in Seattle, said he sees a growing glut of aerospaceresources around the world as military aircraft facilitiesare converted to commercial use. &quot;Does it make sense to spendmoney to build more capacity?&quot; he asked.   David Venz, a vice president of the European consortiumAirbus Industrie, said he could see some benefits in aTaiwanese connection. &quot;But people have to ask a morefundamental question,&quot; he said. &quot;Is there really a market forthe MD-12?&quot;   McDonnell Douglas marketers firmly believe the MD-12 hasadvantages over Boeing's 747 and Airbus's A-330 and A-340 inrange and operating cost. Once a consortium is set, McDonnellDouglas is convinced it can gain an edge with airlines in thePacific Rim, while building less costly jetliners than eitherof its competitors.   &quot;Europe has Airbus,&quot; Taiwan Aerospace's chairman, Mr.Huang, said. &quot;Now maybe the Pacific Rim area should have somekind of organization or company like that. Taiwan certainlywould like to play a role.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
