Gen. Edgardo M. Abeninatold the the Los Angeles Times. ``We shall fight, and we shallcontinue fighting for what we believe in, for the honor of ournation and the dignity of our people _ even if it means going intoa stage of civil war.''   Rebel soldiers battled loyalist troops in Manila's financialdistrict and at armed forces headquarters Sunday, the third day ofan attempt to overthrow Aquino.   Abenina, a former officer of the Philippine constabulary, saidthe insurgents are mostly present or former members of thePhilippine armed forces and none are politicians. He described themas reform-minded nationalists.   Abenina said rebels were fighting Aquino to ``free the Filipinosfrom the shackles of poverty and subservience that have been forcedupon us by the rich and powerful, by elitist governments like thatof Cory Aquino.''   He added, ``Our whole point is that, for centuries, thePhilippines have been under the mercy and control of a very fewpoliticians and moneyed people.'' The coup, according to Abenina,has been planned for more than a year.   Abenina, who Aquino has identified as a rebel ring-leader, said,``Our goal is to purge the armed forces and the politicalleadership of the government of the rampant corruption andpatronage that has set in from the highest to the lowest levels.''   Lt. Col. Gregorio ``Gringo'' Honasan is part of the coup'sleadership, Abenina said. Honasan led an August 1987 coup attemptthat left 53 dead. He was imprisoned but escaped in April 1988.Abenina also took part in the coup attempt and was jailed and laterescaped.   Abenina said if the coup succeeds he will establish amilitary-civilian governing council with himself in charge. Thecouncil would have five to seven members, exercise unchallengedexecutive power and include dozens of Filipino experts, technocratsand professors, Abenina said.   He said the coup attempt, which began Friday, would have beensuccessful if the U.S. mililtary had not intervened.   When President Bush announced that he was extending air supportto the Philippines military, ``we were about to take over thegovernment,'' Abenina said. ``Then the U.S. warplanes appeared. Wesimply cannot hope to win against the stronger power of the UnitedStates Air Force.''   According to American officials, U.S. F-4 fighter-bombers flewcover for loyalist troops on Friday and early Saturday morning butnever fired a shot at ground targets.</TEXT></DOC>
