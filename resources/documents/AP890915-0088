Another anti-government protest, involving nearly 2,000 people,took place at the central square in Pretoria, the capital. Somedemonstrators climbed onto a statue of Paul Kruger, a politicalpatriarch of the Afrikaners who control the government.   Both protests were among the largest ever staged in the twocities, and dramatized the impact of President-elect F.W. de Klerk'sdeclaration this week that his white-led government would not blockpeaceful protests.   On Wednesday, a day after de Klerk's statement, more than 20,000people marched in Cape Town against police brutality, the largestsuch demonstration ever authorized by the government.   The Rev. Peter Storey, a Methodist leader, said at a newsconference after the Johannesburg march that the series of peacefulprotests marked a ``turning point in the history of our land.''   In Johannesburg, marchers included black youths, dark-suitedwhite professionals, nuns and prominent activists, among them WinnieMandela, wife of jailed black nationalist Nelson Mandela. Manyyouths carried posters demanding his release and chanted ``ANC!ANC!'' _ the initials of Mandela's outlawed African NationalCongress guerrilla movement.   About 10,000 marchers began the protest, but the crowd swelled toabout 15,000 as spectators joined the passing parade.   Traffic officers cordoned off side streets leading into theparade route but did not interfere as scores of black and whitechurch leaders headed the procession down thoroughfares thatnormally would have been clogged with lunch-hour traffic.   In Pretoria and Johannesburg, the only police action reported wasagainst white hecklers. Pretoria police led away two men shoutingabuse at protesters, and Johannesburg officers warned a white manwho threw eggs at the parade.   The Johannesburg protesters included a white man, Phillip Botha,who said he was a police reservist and carried a sign reading:``Police Against Police Abuse.''   The march ended a block from John Vorster Square, the main policestation. Policemen looked out from virtually every window of the12-story building.   Six clergymen went to the entrance, and one of them _ the Rev.Frank Chikane _ was allowed inside to present a memorandumprotesting police violence. The document also demanded an end todiscriminatory and restrictive laws so negotiations could begin onending apartheid.   Chikane, secretary-general of the South African Council ofChurches, emerged to tell waiting protesters: ``We have proved ourpoint.''   The crowd prayed and then dispersed.   Anglican Bishop Duncan Buchanan, one of the speakers at a churchservice before the march, told protesters packed into St. Mary'sCathedral: ``We are sick of violence, and we refuse to be pushedaround by a minority of a minority who support a godless and vileideology.''   The organizers had refused to ask official permission for themarch, but state radio said Johannesburg's chief magistrate hadgiven approval, and a Pretoria magistrate had given permission for ademonstration in the central Church Square.   Chikane and other organizers repeatedly appealed to participantsto remain disciplined and non-violent, even if police took actionagainst them. At one point, he appealed to the crowd not to harasssome suspected plainclothes security officers.   In Pretoria, hundreds of people gathered to support a picket bylawyers against the Cape Town violence, where anti-apartheidactivists say at least 23 people died on election day. Police haveconfirmed 15 deaths.   More than 50 policemen stood around the park, and about a dozenpolice trucks and armored vehicles were parked nearby.   The lawyers also had refused to seek permission for theirprotest, saying it was ``part of the inalienable democratic right of... the community at-large to associate and express protest againstany inhuman conduct.''   The lawyers in Pretoria and march organizers in Johannesburgcited a march in Cape Town on Wednesday by 20,000 people asjustification for their actions. Police stayed away from the CapeTown march, and there was no violence, although thousands of peoplethronged the streets for about four hours in the largest legalanti-government protest held in South Africa.   The Cape Town march organizers had refused to seek permission,but Mayor Gordon Oliver asked for it after acting President F.W. deKlerk said he would not oppose the protest if it was peaceful andlegal.   The pro-government Johannesburg newspaper, The Citizen, saidtoday, ``The `victory' in Cape Town is bound to encourage theradicals to put on even more pressure, raising the specter ofrenewed unrest.''   The anti-apartheid New Nation, a black newspapr in Johannesburg,said: ``The march (in Cape Town) showed that the state is inretreat. ... Each backward step must mark the advance of ourpeople.''   The Johannesburg newspaper Business Day said of the marches:``There will be another, and another, each of them raising thestakes until confrontation ensues. Violence, it is safe to say, isalmost inevitable, and the television cameras are waiting.''</TEXT></DOC>
