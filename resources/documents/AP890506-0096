His father was in jail. His mother had taken in a convicted drugaddict who allegedly forced her into prostitution. Neighborssuspected Hanif was being beaten, but didn't speak up. And a statesocial worker didn't detect any danger during repeated visits withthe boy and his mother.   Hanif died last week at the age of 3{.   Randolph Scott, who was living with Hanif and his mother,Rosalyn Rochester, has been charged with the child's murder, andwith assault and battery of both Hanif and Rochester.   ``I personally haven't ever handled anything so gruesome,'' saidLowell Police Inspector David Tousignant. ``And all the veterandetectives who have been here awhile, they say this is one of themost horrifying cases they've seen.''   Investigators say that Scott, 38, left prison in late Januaryand moved in with Rochester a short time later, forcing her intoprostitution to support his heroin habit, as he had done withseveral women in the past.   They shared a cramped, ramshackle house with four other familiesin this former mill town of 90,000 just south of the New Hampshireborder.   As time went on, authorities say, Scott's violence toward theboy and his mother escalated. By the time of Hanif's death, policesaid, the boy's back looked like leather from repeated beatings andburns and there were three big bruises on his face.   Scott told investigators that he hit the boy because he was``wetting his pants and ... he was lazy,'' Tousignant said.   Why didn't the 23-year-old mother get help? ``She was in totalfear of Scott, almost a paralyzing fear,'' said Tousignant.   Tousignant said he found the case frustrating because so manypeople had a chance to speak up and didn't.   The only ones who tried were an anonymous tipster who complainedto authorities that the boy was not getting needed medical care,and Hanif's 5-year-old cousin, who lived in the same building andwas Hanif's best friend.   ``My son came running to me when I got home, crying `Mommy,mommy, my cousin's getting hit too much!''' said the 5-year-old'smother.   ``He got hit with a belt buckle and a shoe,'' the boy said.   The boy's warning to his mother came April 28, when the womanreturned home from a three-week jail term. The boy had stayed withHanif and his mother for two weeks while his own mother was in jail.   That same day, another neighbor also saw Hanif's bruises.Rochester told her that the boy fell out of bed. The woman said shewanted to tell authorities about the beating, but was afraid ofScott.   ``It would have caused a lot of problems for me and my kids,''she said. ``So I just told my boyfriend that I was going to mind myown problems.''   Actually, authorities already had been alerted about Hanif. Thestate Department of Social Services had been checking on him sinceFebruary, after an anonymous tipster claimed the boy wasn'treceiving proper attention for an ear infection.   A social worker first met with Rochester on Feb. 17 and reportedthat she was making an effort to care for Hanif and that the boyhad visited a doctor. The social worker met with Hanif and hismother six times, and the mother separately three times, accordingto DSS spokeswoman Lorraine Carli.   Rochester missed an appointment April 21. The social worker wentto her home April 27, but no one was home. By last weekend, it wastoo late. Hanif was taken to the hospital at about 4:30 a.m. April30 and died the following day.   The autopsy showed Hanif died of blunt trauma to the head,according to Tousignant. There also was evidence he may have beensexually assaulted.   The DSS was aware of Scott's drug use and had unverifiedinformation about Rochester being a prostitute. Carli said thedepartment was concerned that Scott may have been abusingRochester, but had no indication that Hanif was being harmed exceptfor possibly being neglected.   ``It's a very difficult dilemma on what's appropriate whenyou're dealing with a family,'' Carli said. ``That's why the wholesystem is set up so that people can make reports to us at any timeof the day.''   Things seem more simple to Hanif's young cousin and his mother.   ``I just say, `Thank God my kid got out of there,''' the mothersaid.</TEXT></DOC>
