That observation might come as a surprise to people who haveheard of vastly reduced white-collar workforces, and the use ofrobots, automation, computers and other products of the so-calledtechnological revolution.   But, says Robert Leach, partner in Andersen Consulting, to throwtechnology at manufacturing has about as little chance of resolvingits problems as Washington's attempt to attack social problems withan avalanche of dollars.   ``The problem is not technology,'' says Leach. ``It's that toomany companies rushed into it, throwing robots at everything. Butlet's face it: If you automate a mess you still have a mess.''   In his view, based on experience in modernizing largemanufacturing facilities, to tinker with technology can't possiblyhelp. What is required, he says, is the guts to step back and ask:``How would I reinvent this business?''   He is serious, and concerned, which is the reason for speakingout. ``We've been losing one market after another to foreigncompetition,'' he says, ``and it would be a lot worse if the weakdollar weren't helping us abroad.''   In Washington, as well as in many public and private studygroups, the ``answers'' being offered are almost always the same,that we must provide more icnentive to invest in technology.Technology is equated with competitiveness.   It isn't so, says Leach. ``I've seen production flows socomplicated they remind you of `The Flight of the Bumble Bee.'''Quality and lead time, he says, are undercut by excessive movementof products through the factory.   Instead of changing business from the inside out, says Leach, wemust start with the marketplace and work back, providing addedvalue that cannot come from outdated techniques. Value, he says, isnot just price _ it is quality, ease of use, availability andservice, to name just some of its elements.   After making the decision to add value, he says, you must lookat every element from raw material sourcing through production anddistribution. That is, you must think outside-in rather than thetraditional inside-out.   Working back from the marketplace, you must ask a basicquestion: ``Does this activity add value to the end-product? If theanswer is no you eliminate it.'' The goal, he explains, is tocreate a smooth, logistical pipeline.   That type of thinking at a Lockheed's Aeronautical Systems Groupresulted in a radical simplification of an entire sheet metalfabrication process.   Results: Parts that once traveled 2,500 feet in the course ofprocessing now travel only 150 feet. Lead time to produce a partwas cut to two days from 52. Quality rose. Fewer inspections wereneeded. Inventories were cut.   Lockheed did it without a lot of robots or automated guidedvehicles, said Leach. He conceded that more technology was added,``but only as a set of tools to support simplification.''   It isn't easy, he says, but it is necessary if Americanmanufacturers are to become truly competitive. So far, he isn'tconvinced that they are.   ``If a manager wants to break with tradition, he has to link allthe corporate fiefdoms that have evolved over the years,'' hestates. ``The walls between these islands of confusion must bebroken down. We have to get people talking with each other at theearliest stages of product development.''   In a traditional company, he continues, designers work on theirown, then throw a design over the walls to engineering,manufacturing and marketing. They in turn throw it back, eating upprecious development time.   In contrast, at a competitive company teams of designers,engineers, and manufacturers focus on one common, overriding goalfrom day one _ how to get better products in half the time.   ``You don't do that by simply stepping on the gas,'' Leachconcludes. ``You rethink the business. Then you integrate all theelements. You get everyone speaking the same language and sharingthe same information.''   Technology might be a part of the rethinking. But only as a tool.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Thurs, April 13.</NOTE></DOC>
