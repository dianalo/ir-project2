The Agriculture Department says cigarette use dropped 5 percentin 1989, the largest decline in six years. And the trend isexpected to continue.   Overall, American smokers consumed about 533 billion cigaretteslast year, the department's Economic Research Service said Monday.Exports, however, jumped 20 percent to 142 billion cigarettes.   Annual use by the U.S. adult population dropped 7 percent to anaverage of 2,888 cigarettes, the report said. Economist VernerGrise said that was the lowest average since 1942, when the averagewas 2,585 cigarettes per adult.   The peak was 4,345 cigarettes in 1963, before beginning itslongtime decline.   The average is for all Americans 18 years and older, smokers andnon-smokers alike. It is a statistical comparison only and does notindicate the actual smoking habits of the population.   ``Domestic cigarette consumption will probably continue to fallthis year because of higher prices, increased restrictions on wherepeople can smoke, anti-smoking activity and declining socialacceptance of smoking,'' the report said.   Meanwhile, the report said total U.S. tobacco output couldincrease substantially this year, perhaps by 8 percent over the1989 crop of 1.4 billion pounds. However, smaller on-handinventories will reduce total supplies for 1990-91.</TEXT></DOC>
