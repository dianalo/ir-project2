It simply does not make sense in an era of high technology and low communications costs to conduct trading by having thousands of people waving and shouting in trading pits.    Not only is the operation highly people-intensive and very expensive but, more important, at a time when trading is becoming globalized, it is difficult to keep the markets open beyond their normal hours to accommodate traders in Europe and Asia. Though some exchanges already have instituted several hours of night trading to attract Japanese business, it would be extremely costly to arrange for a shift of pit traders to function at the crack of dawn and late into the night. In these days of computerized trading, it is a relatively simple matter to keep markets open for traders in various time zones.    Automated trading will also help keep traders honest -- an important concern in the wake of the recent scandal at the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The allegations of abuse there include kickbacks, skimming customer profits, and prearranging trades in soybeans, foreign currencies and Treasury bonds.    In the pits, the possibility of cheating can never be regulated out of existence, no matter how tightly the rules are enforced by the commodities exchanges themselves or by the federal government's Commodities Futures Trading Commission. The pits create a frenzied environment in which trading practices are difficult to track and to enforce.    In computerized trading, however, while tainted input, pre-arranged trading and profit-skimming are still possible, they are far less likely. When traders enter orders independently from their own offices, and when they know that trades can be easily traced and audited, the potential for unethical conduct will diminish.    Abuse on the Chicago commodities markets was encouraged by the ease of avoiding detection. The commodities markets are unable to provide a full record of all transactions. They lack an &quot;audit trail,&quot; which would allow the regulatory agencies to reconstruct the sequence of trades.    The New York Stock Exchange, which is mostly automated, can reproduce the sequence of all trades, including time, the identity of buyers and sellers, and the price and amount of the transaction. In the commodities markets, however, only select and incomplete information is provided by reporters stationed in the pits. For example, the buyers and sellers are identified only later in the clearing process, which makes it very difficult to reconstruct a complete record of all trading. Without a full record, the scope for fraud expands.    A computerized trading system would change all that dramatically. For example, if a commodities broker systematically engaged in &quot;front running&quot; of customer orders, he would run a significant risk of detection. In front running, the broker places an order for his own account to buy or sell ahead of the customer's. If a broker engaged in that practice frequently, an audit of the sequence of trading could uncover it.    There might still be a question of intent: whether the broker acted independent of the customer order or in response to it. But there are sophisticated surveillance techniques, generally called &quot;analysis programs,&quot; that can reveal systematic patterns of trading. No longer would FBI undercover agents have to mingle in the pit to establish a pattern of malfeasance. Surveillance would become continuous and routine.    The physical separation of brokers would also make it harder for traders to agree to execute each other's orders and to kick back ill-gotten gains. An electronic audit trail of transactions would strengthen market regulations in many ways and go a long way toward ensuring more equitable and efficient market trading.    The technology for automating pit trading is not something to be achieved in the future; it is here. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange has signed an agreement with Reuters to set up an after-hours futures trading network to be known as Globex. It is scheduled to start up Dec. 1, with hours of operation from 6 p.m. till 6 a.m. The Chicago Board of Trade has unveiled its own automated system, called Aurora, which is scheduled to go into operation next year. Aurora may, however, be combined with Globex if current negotiations succeed. London's International Financial Futures Exchange is putting the finishing touches on its Automated Pit Trading System, which will imitate pit trading on a computer screen.    If the systems work as well as expected, there is no reason to confine electronic trading to after hours, as is now planned. The economies of computerized trading are likely to make pit trading uncompetitive and put this antiquated system out of its misery.    Allegations of crooked trading have made the need to overhaul pit trading and regulations more apparent than ever. Indeed, computerized trading may be the only way to restore public confidence in these tarnished markets. The sooner the better.    ---   Mr. Freund, former chief economist of the New York Stock Exchange, is a professor of economics at Pace University's graduate business school. </TEXT></DOC>
