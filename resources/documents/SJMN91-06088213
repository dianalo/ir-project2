The vaccine was developed byRoy Curtiss III, chairman of biology at the university.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Front  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  SALMONELLA VACCINE FOR CHICKENS BEING TESTED  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     Salmonella causes severe and sometimes fatal food poisoning in up to 3.7million people in the United States each year. Poultry products are theprimary cause.;    The vaccine has protected chickens against salmonella inlaboratory tests. If large-scale field trials over the next few years aresuccessful, the vaccine could prove to be a major public health and economicbenefit.;    &quot;I believe we can effectively immunize the five billion chickensraised in this country every year,&quot; Curtiss said. That would &quot;reduce theprobability of its transmission to people and animals, and eventually we mightbe able to control the problem.&quot;;    The vaccine is given orally to newlyhatched chicks. It triggers the self-defense &quot;immune&quot; system to block thegrowth of salmonella bacteria in the animal's digestive tract.;    Poultryindustry officials have been concerned about a new strain of salmonella thatinfects eggs before they are laid by the hen, said Professor Robert Marshall,a food microbiologist at the University of Missouri at Columbia. As a result,salmonella infections from uncooked eggs have risen recently, primarily in thenortheastern United States.;    If Curtiss has an effective vaccine, &quot;it meansa tremendous amount to the poultry industry and to people who eat eggs,&quot;Marshall said.;    Curtiss also is working on a version of the vaccine thatwould protect pigs -- another major source of human food poisoning.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  St. Louis Post-Dispatch  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  St. Louis  </CITY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910328  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  5A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  270  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday March 28, 199100088213,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
