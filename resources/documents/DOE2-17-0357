This proteinis permeable to H+ and thus allows respiration (and therefore thermogenesis)to proceed at a rapid rate, independent of ADP phosphorylation. Protonconductance can be inhibited by the binding of purine nucleotides tothe uncoupling protein. The binding of [{sup 3}H]-GDP to BAT mitochondriais frequently used as a measure of BAT thermogenic activity. Rats feda diet that was low but adequate in protein exhibited a decrease in feedefficiency. In addition, BAT thermogenesis was activated as indicatedby an elevation in the level of GDP binding to BAT mitochondria. Thisphenomena occurred in older rats and persisted over time.</TEXT></DOC>
