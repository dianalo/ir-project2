  While it's unsurprisingandM;that The Times Top 100 companies should want technology based on the highestperformance processor available, the speed at which 286-based machines arebeing left behind is unprecedented.andP;  The question remaining isn't whether386-based Pcs will dominate such installations in the 1990s, but whether the286 processor is on its way to becoming redundant.andM;The survey, 'Major Organisations Focus Report: Personal Computing', foundthat over half (52.3 per cent) of all PCs to be bought next year by UKcorporate users will be based on the newer 80386SX chip.andM;The figures make more sense when they are compared with the number of PCsalready installed in corporate sites.andP;  Romtec found that 38.2 per cent ofmachines installed are either 8088 or 8086, 37.8 per cent are 80286, 2.0 percent are 80386sx-based and only 19.8 per cent are 80386 PCs.andP;  According tothose figures, demand for 386 machines will be more than twice the percentageof 386 machines bought this year.andM;The real casualties will be the older XT-type machines, which look set to bereplaced by entry-level 80286 and 80386SX machines.andP;  Only 9.8 per cent of PCsbought next year will be 8086-or 8088-based.andP;  Demand for 80286 machines willbe fairly stable, but this could be because users re replacing older PCs with80286 machines.andM;Certainly, there's no sign of a let-up in 286 launches by manufacturers.andO;Significantly, when Dell announced its 210 80286 PC this summer it said itwould be targeting the 'replacement market'.andP;  Dell estimates 30 per cent ofnext year's sales will be replacements for 8088 and 8086 machines.andM;It looks likely that 80286 PCs will become entry-level machines for smallbusinesses.andP;  With Dell's 210 at around 1,000 pound sterling for a fullsystem, 286 technology is now available to more people.andP;  But how will 286machines fit into the corporate picture?andM;Compaq's sales director, Peter Manson, says his company's products are aimedat a wide range of users in large organizations.andP;  The machines they usedepend on the applications they want to run.andP;  Compaq's entry-level 286e issuitable for user with applications like email and WP, but people usingheavy-duty databases and software development packages are better off with a386/20 or 386/33.andM;He adds that there is a future for 286 PCs, if only as network workstationsor stand alone word processors.andP;  But he can understand why so many users areleapfrogging 286 technology and moving straight on to a 386 platform.andM;The most significant reason for that move is that corporate users are lookingahead.andP;  They're aware of the direction software is taking and want to be ableto exploit products as soon as they appear.andP;  For example, they want to useproducts running under Windows/386 and databases such as Paradox/386.andP;  Itlooks like more of these products will appear over the next year so, with theaverage life of a corporate PC running at three years, it makes sense ot'future proof now.andM;A key development in future proofing is the 80386SX variant on the 80386chip.andP;  Although touted as an alternative to the 286, Romtec found that peoplewere more likely to buy 386SXs than 386 machines.andP;  The reason may be thatcompanies are buying 386 technology in the form of SX machines to startimplementing 386 systems.andP;  The advantage of SX machines isn't betterperformance over 286 PCs, but they are cheaper than 386 machines.andM;The ownership of 386 and 386SX machines will be further boosted when thepromised 386 version of OS/2 is launched.andP;  But for now, they could be gainingground for two more reasons.andP;  One is that 386 machines are in demand asfileservers on the rapidly growing number of PC LANs.andP;  Another is that the386 version of Unix is generally held to be superior than the previous 286version.andM;It looks as though there's room at the moment for processors at all levels.andO;Corporate users have to consider price and performance.andP;  Budgets may onlyallow purchase of 100 386 and 300 286 machines, for example.andP;  The differencein price between the two is still high, despite the SX.andP;  An entry-levelCompaq 286 costs 1,695 pounds sterling, an SX PC 2,195 pounds sterling and a386/20 3,195 pounds sterling.andP;  A company may conclude that a 286 machine canoffer more speed and power than an SX, for 500 pounds sterling or so less.andM;But others, looking ahead, are jumping from 8086/88 machines to 80386 and, intime, 80486 processors.andP;  IBM's involvement in the process can't be ignoredand now that it's launched its own 80386SX-based PS/2, this will probablyreplace the Model 50z as its entry-level machine.andM;1990 will be a time for observing changes in the software on offer, and forplanning to buy machines to run it.andP;  The Post Office has already decided tostandardize on 80386 PCs.andP;  It has 4,000 machines, of which about 25 per centare 386-based.andM;Its executive and office systems manager, Ken Taylor, says that the PostOffice opted to stick with 8086s for basic uses and to install 80386 machinesfor power users over a year ago.andP;  The reason was that he could see users whowanted to run heavy-duty applications would soon run out of power with 286machines.andM;It's taking a long time for 8086/88-based PCs to be wholly replaced.andP;  But thesigns are that powerful applications and connectivity requirements will makecompanies adopt the 80386 far more quickly than they did with the 80286.andP;  Aside-effect will be a relatively quick demise for the 80286, although itsimmediate future is relatively secure.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
