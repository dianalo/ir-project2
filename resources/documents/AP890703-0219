Police said it was not clear what triggered the barrages hoursafter the announcement in Damascus, Syria's capital, that the15-week-old land blockade of the Christian sector would be lifted atnoon Tuesday.   Police said shellfire pounded residential districts in Christianeast Beirut and the Western Moslem sector, but they had no immediateword on casualties.   In Baghdad, Iraq, President Saddam Hussein told Arab Leagueenvoys Monday peace will not come to Lebanon until all foreignforces _ including the Syrians _ withdraw, informed official sourcesthere reported.   Syrians and Christians engaged in artillery clashes and warringShiite Moslem factions in west Beirut had a second day of gunbattles.   Justice Minister Nabih Berri, leader of the Shiite Amal militia,said roads into the 310-square-mile Christian enclave would reopenTuesday ``to all people,'' including crossings on Beirut's dividingGreen Line and the airport.   But Berri said, after he and five other Syrian-backed Moslemmilitia leaders met Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa, that ablockade of Christian ports would remain to stop arms suppliesgetting through.   The Christian enclave north of Beirut has been besieged sinceMarch 14.   The airport, in Beirut's Moslem section, has been closed sincefighting began between Syrians and Christians on March 8.   Monday's move appeared to be a guarded Syrian response to anoffer Sunday by Iraq, Syria's main Arab rival, to stop armsshipments to the Christians if the Syrians withdraw from Lebanon.   Iraq's Hussein called for an end to outside interference inLebanese affairs when he met Monday with the foreign ministers ofAlgeria, Morocco and Saudi Arabia, the official Iraqi News Agencyreported.   Hussein said he believes all foreign forces in Lebanon shouldpull out. Syria has 40,000 troops deployed there. The Israelis alsooccupy a border strip in south Lebanon, and Iran has about 2,000Revolutionary Guards in east Lebanon.   Iraq supports Lebanon's Christians and moved to aid them afterthe Aug. 20 cease-fire in the eight-year Iran-Iraq war. Syria backedIran in that conflict.   The three Arab ministers are seeking to get Syria and Iraq tostop supporting their warring Lebanese allies to end the latestflareup in the country's 14-year-old civil war. The 22-member ArabLeague has asked leaders of Algeria, Morocco and Saudi Arabia tosettle Lebanon's crisis by November.   Berri, spokesman for the six-group Lebanese National Front, saidmaintaining the sea blockade ``is still necessary to prevent thearrival of weapons and means of destruction.''   That indicated Syrian forces and their allies will continueshelling the Christian coastline, as they have done each day fornearly four months.   ``The situation of the ports will remain unchanged'' until theChristian leader, Gen. Michel Aoun, lifts his blockade ofmilitia-run ports, Berri said.   It was Aoun's blockade in March that set off the current round offighting. Police said 396 people have been killed and 1,533 woundedin the latest violence.   Berri's announcement was the first significant move toward asettlement. He said it was ``an overture toward political dialogue''with the Christians to formulate political reforms aimed at endingthe war.   Earlier, Syrian troops traded tank and machine-gun fire withChristian troops across Beirut's Green Line, and Syrian artillerybatteries pounded the Christian coastline north of the capital.   Christian gunners retaliated by shelling the seaside boulevardswhere Syrian guns are located. No casualties were reported.   Militiamen of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, andAmal battled wih rocket-propelled grenades and machine guns in westBeirut. Police had no report of casualties in the fighting, whichshattered an overnight cease-fire called by the Syrians.   Three people were killed and 11 wounded in street battles Sunday,the first major clash between the rival factions for months. Themilitias are battling for control of Lebanon's 1 million Shiites. Itis the country's largest sect.</TEXT></DOC>
