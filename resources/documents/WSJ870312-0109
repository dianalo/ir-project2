O' BoyleStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 03/12/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> EUROP </IN><DATELINE> BONN, West Germany  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Chancellor Helmut Kohl and his conservative colleagues like to think of themselves as having ushered in a new direction in German politics when they moved into the chancellery in 1982. They even have a name for it: die Wende, or the political turning they believe they brought to Bonn.    But, as Mr. Kohl and his Christian Democratic Union embark on a second, four-year term of conservative rule, the party's politics look hardly Wendelike. German conservatives aren't the fire-breathing variety found in the U.S. and Britain. While Mr. Kohl admires Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, he hasn't any desire to follow their radical departure from past policies.    Instead, above all, the chancellor and his party want to maintain the status quo. They practice the politics of moderation. And it plays in Pforzheim. Germany may be the non-communist world's third-largest industrial power but it is also a welfare state, and Chancellor Kohl's caution strikes a responsive chord with the average German, who is averse to risk and wary of sudden shifts.    Germany's meek brand of conservatism explains a lot about German behavior, particularly in the financial realm. Take taxes. Since 1981, the Reagan administration has lowered the top marginal tax rate for U.S. citizens to 28% from 70%; U.S. tax cuts have totaled almost $1.5 trillion.    Mr. Kohl's top fiscal adviser, Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg, thought it a good idea that Germany do something similar. The chancellor himself made taxes a major issue in his reelection campaign.    But now the government says it will introduce legislation this year to lower taxes a mere $24 billion -- and not until 1990. What's more, the three coalition parties agreed to accept a lowering of the top individual rate of 56%, to 53%, only after Mr. Kohl threatened to resign, according to one account.    Germany's go-slow conservatism also inhibits reform in other areas of the economy. State subsidies to agriculture and business have actually increased during the government's tenure, according to calculations by the respected Kiel Institute. Government regulation of private enterprise is as overwhelming as ever. Nor is the Kohl government likely to sell more than a modest number of shares it holds in some 1,000 companies.    Why don't the conservatives press a more forceful agenda? To some extent, the German system works against reform. Germany's 11 states, which existed before formation of the federal government in 1949, wield enormous power. The federal government can't change the tax law, for instance, without the support of a majority of the Laender, as the states are called. Under Germany's constitution, all fiscal reforms must be approved by the upper house of parliament before they become law. But only the states have representation in the upper house.    &quot;Germany hasn't had a Wende, like Britain or the United States, and it is very unlikely that it ever will,&quot; says Ralf Dahrendorf, the former dean of the London School of Economics. Mr. Dahrendorf argues that Germany's multiple checks and balances makes &quot;dramatic change technically impossible.&quot;    But Germany's minimalist approach also reflects the political philosophy of its leaders. Mr. Stoltenberg headed the coalition talks on tax reform. Yet associates say he really doesn't believe in cutting taxes. Instead he hews to a strict philosophy that regards any budget deficit as a danger. &quot;With Stoltenberg, it's always a question of the fiscal consequences,&quot; says a friend.    Similarly, the average German is suspicious of tax cuts because they can add to government deficits, which are feared as destabilizing and inflationary.    Nor are the Germans inclined to listen to U.S. pleas to stimulate their economy. Short-term remedies are distrusted because they deviate from the steady course. As one Christian Democratic politician puts it, &quot;We don't believe quick fixes are the right way to stimulate our economy.&quot;    Indeed, Germans appear to have an inherent fear of sudden and dramatic change, perhaps dating from events leading to and during the Nazi period. It also probably reflects the structure of society itself. Even today, German society is dominated by rural life and small towns, where change isn't welcomed.    The German population, moreover, is the oldest of any nation in the world. Elderly voters comprise a big voting bloc that is deeply suspicious of change. The generous old-age pensions and other benefits they receive have become part of Germany's social thinking, instituted more than a century ago by the &quot;Iron Chancellor,&quot; Otto von Bismarck, who despite his nickname gave German conservatism a heavy component of compassion and social justice.    That tradition continues. Even the most right-wing elements of the coalition -- the Christian Democrats' Bavarian sister party, for instance -- have deep ties to labor, the working class and Christian social thought. </TEXT></DOC>
