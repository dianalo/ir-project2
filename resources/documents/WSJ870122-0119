RobertsStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 01/22/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> TELECOMMUNICATIONS, BROADCASTING, TELEPHONE, TELEGRAPH (TEL) </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   John Werner Kluge, the septuagenarian who liquidated Metromedia Inc. and became a billionaire about thrice over in the process, is building another business empire.    &quot;Even though I'm 72, I'm going to start a whole new career,&quot; he beams. &quot;I plan to be personally involved -- not just in name -- in a broad-based investment program. The projects will speak for themselves.&quot; Long-distance telecommunications will be a big area of activity.    His vehicle will be Metromedia Co., the general partnership that was formed in November to replace the liquidated Metromedia Inc., which Mr. Kluge owned most of. The partnership is substantially dominated by Mr. Kluge and includes only one other partner, Stuart Subotnick, Mr. Kluge's longtime associate. The two are now scanning the world for business opportunities, Mr. Kluge says, and hope to make some new investments and acquisitions by next year.    Mr. Kluge and Metromedia plan to boost their activities in the long-distance telephone business, a crowded and hotly competitive market that already is littered with failures. Metromedia entered the business in 1983 with the acquisition of a small Texas long-distance reseller and a second acquisition in Florida two years later. The market, which already is undergoing consolidation and has seen more than one Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law filing, is dominated by American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., MCI Communications Corp. and US Sprint Communications Co.    Like most of the 400 or so small players in that market, Metromedia simply leases capacity on other telecommunication companies' networks and resells service to customers. With about 250,000 customers in Texas and Florida, Metromedia Long Distance moved into New York six months ago. In the past 18 months, it has spent as much as $9 million to replace six of its seven big switches with new digital switches, says Howard Finkelstein, president.    Mr. Finkelstein says the company plans to spend $35 million in the next five years strictly for leases for fiber-optic lines. That program began last June. Metromedia acknowledges that it can expect to compete only in a small segment of the long-distance business. US Sprint, a joint venture between GTE Corp. and United Telecommunications Corp., is the smallest of the three major carriers. It plans to spend $800 million to expand its network this year.    Metromedia Long Distance will be a regional &quot;niche player,&quot; focusing on small and medium-sized businesses and leaving the broad market to ATandamp;T, MCI and Sprint, he says, adding, &quot;We're not trying to be all things to all people.&quot;    &quot;We're going to expand,&quot; says Mr. Kluge. &quot;We will increase our commitment this year.&quot; He says the expansion plans may include acquisitions and equity investments. &quot;Long-distance is the biggest business going today,&quot; he says. &quot;It is a part of all of our lives.&quot;    Mr. Kluge offered glimpses of his business future in an interview. The setting was a cocktail party thrown by Metromedia -- with bountiful helpings of duck fricassee, crab legs, shrimp and oysters -- in the ornate library of New York's prestigous Metropolitan Club. The occasion was to showcase the signing of a new client, New York-based Telecommunications Cooperative Network, a nonprofit cooperative of hospitals, charities, universities and research foundations.    In the last two years, Mr. Kluge, a Virginia native, has dismantled the vast communications and entertainment empire that he began building in 1947 with the acquisition of a radio station in Silver Spring, Md. The sell-off included the television stations that Rupert Murdoch acquired for $2 billion as a cornerstone of his Fox Television Network; radio stations, an outdoor advertising business, cellular telephone properties, the Ice Capades and the Harlem Globetrotters.    Mr. Kluge's actions have spurred widespread speculation about how he would spend the resulting cash hoard, estimated at close to $3 billion. He won't comment on the amount except to say, &quot;It's enough to do the job.&quot; Without elaborating, Mr. Kluge says the new tax legislation prompted him to sell off his various businesses. He retains a 9.3% stake in Orion Pictures Corp., the movie studio, but says he plans no future investments in broadcasting or related media areas. &quot;I've been in it for 40 years,&quot; he says. &quot;It's time to move on.&quot;    Mr. Kluge is in no rush to spend his money. &quot;We don't feel any compunction to be in a hurry,&quot; he says. And what seems clear is that Metromedia isn't limiting itself to service or manufacturing concerns. &quot;We're looking at everything,&quot; Mr. Kluge says, adding that the company is doing a &quot;comprehensive study&quot; of opportunities both in the U.S. and abroad, particularly in Europe and Asia. The company is primarily interested in small closely held companies that, Mr. Kluge suggests, could later be taken public.    Though Metromedia is planning to expand its long-distance operations, it remains unclear why Mr. Kluge has targeted an industry where profit margins are slim and competition is growing fiercer. &quot;We love competition,&quot; he says. &quot;We thrive on that.&quot; Mr. Finkelstein, who is leading Metromedia's long-distance efforts, is a newcomer to the industry. He was a financial executive in the broadcast industry and joined Metromedia Inc.'s staff in 1983 soon after the company bought the Boston television station where he worked.    Mr. Kluge has also shown enthusiasm before in businesses he later bailed out of. For example, the company last year agreed to sell its cellular phone business to St. Louis-based Southwestern Bell Corp. for $1.2 billion. But Mr. Kluge says the decision was purely financial: &quot;What happens is, there comes a magic price. You have to rethink an investment in turns of the present value of money.&quot; He adds that some investors linger too long in a business and never &quot;maximize value.&quot;    Some might find it curious that a 72-year-old man with vast wealth would even contemplate diving anew into the world of investments and acquisitions. But says Mr. Kluge: &quot;That's the thing that makes life interesting. Being in a deck chair doesn't. We are always on roller skates here.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
