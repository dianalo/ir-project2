At the same time, Reagan acknowledged that the United States hasan ``agonizing'' problem in dealing with its homeless and needs todo more to curb unemployment and combat bigotry.   Reagan made the remarks in a speech that was markedly lessconfrontational than his foreign policy address in Springfield,Mass., April 21, which Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev rebuked asconfrontational.   Both speeches were billed as scene-setters for the May 29-June 2summit meeting between the two leaders in Moscow.   In his address here to the National Strategy Forum, anon-partisan organization that sponsors educational programs onnational security and foreign policy issues, Reagan said that overthe last three years some 300 political and religious prisonershave been released from Soviet labor camps.   He said the changes were ``limited'' and added, ``We encouragethe Soviets to go further.''   ``But we applaud the changes that have taken place,'' he said.   Reagan said the United States is also ``heartened'' by theincreased rate of people being permitted to leave the Soviet Union.   In a brief question-and-answer session with the audience, Reagansaid he was willing to give Gorbachev ``the benefit of the doubt,up to a point,'' that he sincerely wants to achieve the program ofeconomic and social reforms known as glasnost.   He also expressed a dream ``to rid the world'' of nuclearweapons. He compared the danger of nuclear weapons to ahypothetical situation in which the world was threatened by a powerfrom outer space.   ``Wouldn't we all of a sudden find that we didn't have anydifferences between us at all, we were all human beings, citizensof the world, and wouldn't we come together to fight thatparticular threat?,'' Reagan asked.   On Tuesday, Richard Schifter, assistant secretary of state forhuman rights and humanitarian affairs, said that applications forJewish emigration are now being handled ``reasonably fast.'' But hetold the National Conference on Soviet Jewry that Jews wishing toleave the Soviet Union should apply now, lest the approval processslow down.   For his part, Reagan said, ``In recent months, the Soviet Unionhas shown a willingness to respect at least some human rights. Itis my belief that there is hope for further change, hope that inthe days ahead the Soviets will grant further recognition to thefundamental civil and political rights of all.''   Reagan also noted that Gorbachev has initiated some reforms _allowing over the last three years the release of 300 political andreligious prisoners from prison camps, slowing the incarcerationsof dissidents in mental hospital and prisons, and allowing somebroadenings of freedom of the press.   He then noted that the Soviets often reply to criticism of theirhuman rights record by noting that the United States has problemsof homelessness, unemployment and discrimination within its ownborders.   ``Yes, the United States has social and economic shortcomings,''he said.   ``Unemployment, for one. As a free people we have created aneconomic expansion that over the past five years has created nearly16 million jobs, but we need to do more.''   ``Homelessness is indeed a problem, and an agonizing one,'' headded. ``As a free people, our churches, synagogues, and a host ofvolunteer organizations do much to provide the homeless with food,clothing and medicines. And yet, there is no denying that a problemremains.''   ``Racial discrimination -- our strides as a free people duringjust the past three decades have been dramatic,'' the presidentsaid. ``Yet the problem lingers, and we continue to battle bigotryand prejudie.''   Reagan said that while ``so-called economic and social rightsbelong to an essentially different category from civil andpolitical rights,'' it is also true that ``the Soviets may becoming to understand something of the connection ... between humanrights and economic growth.''   ``The Soviets should recognize basic human rights because it isthe right thing to do,'' he said. ``But, if they recognize humanrights for reasons of their own _ because they seek economicgrowth, or because they want to enter into a more normalrelationship with the United States and other nations _ well, Iwant to say here and now, that's fine by me.''   In his Springfield speech, Reagan had said that if the SovietUnion was changing it was ``because the costs of aggression and thereal moral difference between our systems were brought home to it.''   Reagan also spoke sharply of the Soviets in that speech andsuggested they might not be sincere about their stated intention toend their military occupation of Afghanistan.   Gorbachev, in a Moscow meeting with Secretary of State GeorgeShultz, criticized Reagan's speech, giving way to a round of harshtit-for-tat rejoinders that have marked U.S.-Soviet comments inrecent weeks.   Gorbachev decried the ``confrontational'' tone of the speech andsaid that if the Soviets responded in kind, it could become ``nolonger possible to solve any further issues'' between the twosuperpowers.   In a speech Tuesday, the president said Gorbachev has admittedthe Soviet Union made mistakes dealing with religious believers indecades past and they would be ``rectified.''   ``What we hope for ultimately is a willingness to see continuedchange, in the spirit of glasnost, when it comes to matters ofreligion,'' Reagan told a meeting on religious rights at the WhiteHouse.   Glasnost is the Russian term for the Soviet leader's policy ofbringing openness to Soviet society.</TEXT></DOC>
