It would seem the biggest war is here inthe U.S.   I could only laugh at the comment from George Knox, vicepresident of public affairs for Philip Morris: &quot;There is noindustry or business where there are not some socialconcerns.&quot; Maybe not, but no other industry has such acontemptible &quot;public-be-damned&quot; attitude as the tobaccoindustry. It considers the 400,000 annual deaths from itsproducts as simply part of the cost of doing business. Itsproduct is the only one in this country that has absolutelyno good uses. And what taxes are collected from the sale oftobacco products are minuscule compared with the costs ofhealth, property damage and death that can be attributeddirectly to tobacco usage.</LP><TEXT>   This year marks the 27th year since the original surgeongeneral's warning in 1964, citing the hazards of tobacco use.We have moved slowly enough. It is time to put a stop to thekilling in this country.   Howard D. Hallman III   Fort Worth, Texas</TEXT></DOC>
