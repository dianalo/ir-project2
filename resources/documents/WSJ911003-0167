That is simply not true byany stretch of the imagination.   The use of self-serving and inflammatory language from aplaintiffs' filing in a suit filed in 1987, and linking thattotally unproven statement to our present-day earnings isunwarranted by any facts and bears no relation toBrowning-Ferris's record.</LP><TEXT>   To be sure, Browning-Ferris is not perfect; we have hadantitrust convictions -- two. One event occurred in Atlantain the late 1970s, and the other in Toledo, Ohio, in theearly 1980s. We paid fines, and in one case our employee wentto jail.   Any antitrust violation is deplorable, and is a violationof company and societal standards. But our record hardlyconstitutes widespread or pervasive practices as your storystrongly implies.   Any company with more than 26,000 employees operating inmore than 400 locations around the country will never be ableto guarantee that no employee will violate its own internalrules or the law. We are doing everything we know how toensure that there are no further violations and we believeour antitrust record over the past years shows the results ofthose efforts.   As noted in an earlier article in the Journal,Browning-Ferris has seen its revenues and earnings come underpressure this year because of the recession and significantchanges taking place in the solid-waste industry. Our peopleare working very hard to weather these changes. They deserveto have this company treated in a more balanced way by thecountry's leading daily business newspaper.   William D.
