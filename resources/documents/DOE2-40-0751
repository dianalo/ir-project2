<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-40-0751 </DOCNO><TEXT>Semiconductor-diode lasers remain the subject of intensive worldwide developmentefforts with rapid progress being made in many areas of device designand performance. In addition to their use in optical-fiber systems, otherapplications have been identified and lasers are being fabricated tomeet many different system requirements. This meeting treated all aspectsof laser design, development, and characterization. Laser and opticaltechniques are increasingly important for diagnostics of a wide varietyof materials and processing technologies. Applications range from diagnosticsof impurities and other defects in materials, to probes of dry-processingtechnologies for semiconductor-device fabrication, to imaging techniquesfor patterning and analysis in VLSI manufacture. These techniques arebeing used both for analytic measurements and as tools to probe new materialsand effects. This meeting brought together workers from all of theseareas for the exchange of results and of new directions for research.</TEXT></DOC>
