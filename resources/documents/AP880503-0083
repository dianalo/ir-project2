Strike leaders said 80 percent of the 12,000 workers had droppedtheir tools.   The yard's giant cranes were idle, and a large poster at thegate listed the strikers' demands: higher pay, reinstatement ofSolidarity nationwide, release of political prisoners andreinstatement of fired activists.   Thousands of workers, gathered in the factory's courtyard andperched on rooftops and fences, heard Walesa's speech.   ``We don't want to be the beggars of Europe and of the world,''Walesa told the shipyard workers as he endorsed the strike thatbegan Monday.   Walesa, who headed the August 1980 strike at the shipyard thatgave rise to the East bloc's first independent labor movement,received a loud cheer from the workers when he entered the yardthis morning.   The 44-year-old electrician had been on sick leave this week,complaining of back pains and low blood sugar.   Walesa told workers that Poland's labor struggle had exhaustedhim.   ``I am not your leader. I am tired ... You have to find foryourself a new Walesa,'' he said.   He also told the workers they were taking up the same cause hefought for in 1980.   ``We lost eight years,'' he said, speaking through a loudspeaker.   ``Here, in the birthplace of Solidarity, I state to theauthorities that they are deepening the losses, they are forcingSolidarity to lead the nation onto the road to reforms,'' saidWalesa, winner of the 1983 Nobel Peace Prize.   The work stoppage at the shipyard was at least the fourth strikein communist Poland in a week and contributed to the worst wave oflabor unrest since the government's December 1981 militarycrackdown on Solidarity.   In Wroclaw today, workers at a railroad car plant stoppedproduction for about an hour. And a bitter strike at the Leninsteelworks in southern Poland entered its eighth day.   About 1,000 workers laid down their tools for several hours atthe Pafawag railroad car plant in Wroclaw, said Solidarityspokeswoman Barbara Labuda, but they resumed work after a promisefor talks with management. Government spokesman Jerzy Urbanconfirmed the stoppage.   Alojzy Szablewski, 62, a 36-year veteran of the shipyard who leda strike at the Lenin shipyard when martial law was imposed inDecember 1981, has emerged as the leader of the strike committee.   ``The nation has to believe somebody. It will believe onlySolidarity,'' Szablewski said in a speech today at the shipyardgate.   Walesa ``supports us,'' Szablewski told the strikers. ``Welisten to him and follow his advice.''   Walesa endorsed the strike when it began Monday. But he stayedoff the local strike committee to coordinate Solidarity activitiesnationwide, activists said.   Strikers slept outside in the shipyard overnight and policedetachments roamed the city, but were not near the shipyard gate.   When the strike began Monday, police surrounded the shipyard,and authorities reportedly rounded up regional Solidarity leaders.   Nevertheless, Solidarity adviser Jack Kuron said management hadagreed to talk today to the shipyard's newly formed strikecommittee.   A spokesman for the shipyard was unavailable today and asecretary said shipyard director Czeslaw Tolwinski was in a meeting.   The news of the strike heartened the steelworkers insoutheastern Poland.   ``We feel better now,'' said Jan Ciesielski, a member of thesteel strike committee at the Lenin steel works in Nowa Hutaoutside Krakow.   A Solidarity communique signed by Walesa and issued late Mondaysaid, ``A strike wave is covering the country. They are not justlocal conflicts. They are across Poland because the cause is theeconomic crisis and the lack of convincing reform policies thatwould offer prospects for the future.''   Workers want pay raises of up to 60 percent because prices haverisen about 40 percent this year due to reductions in governmentsubsidies.   Kuron said police arrested nine regional representatives on the13-member Solidarity National Executive Commission. Bogdan Lis, aGdansk Solidarity leader, was detained, said Solidarity's chaplain,the Rev. Henryk Jankowski.   Poland's latest labor trouble began April 25 with a wildcataction by transit workers in Bydgoszcz. It was settled the same daywith pay raises of at least 50 percent. Thousands of workers at theStalowa Wola heavy machinery plant struck Friday and ended theaction Saturday after promises of higher pay.   About half the 3,500 workers at the Dolmel electronics plant inWroclaw, southwestern Poland, stopped work Monday. Josef Pinior, aSolidarity leader, said the job action ended when managementpromised a raise.</TEXT></DOC>
