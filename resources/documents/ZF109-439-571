 Now Army and Navy officials are studying theplan, said Brian Drew, deputy program manager for JUSTIS at the Air ForceLogistics Command (AFLC) here.andM;Drew said program officials already have concluded that JUSTIS, which beganas an Air Force-only project, is 90 percent compatible with needs in theother major services.andP;  &quot;There's corporate agreement on the solution to theproblem of automating our technical orders,&quot; Drew said.andM;Full joint service compatibility will be accomplished with the aid of Armyand Navy staff who recently were assigned to the program office here atWright-Patterson Air Force Base, Drew said.andP;  Recently, the Army chipped in$250,000 for the office, and Drew said the Navy soon will contributeandM;The CIM project was launched earlier this year by senior officials in theOffice of the Secretary of Defense as part of the Bush administration'scontinuing Defense Management Review.andM;To accomplish CIM, teams of experts are studying requirements for singlesystems to serve all the uniformed services and other agencies within DOD inseven categories of business operation.andM;In late June, the DOD comptroller asked those teams to begin looking forexisting systems that might be used as &quot;interim standard systems&quot; by allthree services until requirements are made final.andM;Technical orders, however, were not included in the CIM functional studiesnor subjected to the search for interim systems because they are justbeginning to be automated, officials said.andM;Instead, OSD earlier this year ordered the other services to join with theAir Force in development of a Technical Order Management System.andP;  Thus didthe Air Force's AFTOMS program become the DOD's JUSTIS program.andM;Technical orders are provided by suppliers of weapons systems and otherequipment to the military under contract.andP;  To date, the services havemaintained these orders in conventional filing systems, which on somemilitary bases require warehouses of their own, Drew said.andM;Plethora of PagesandM;The Air Force alone has 152,000 such orders amounting to about 23 millionpages.andP;  The Navy has 250,000 orders at 31 million pages, and the Army about27,000 different orders amounting to 3.3 million pages, Drew said.andM;He also explained that, increasingly, vendors have pushed DOD to establish amethod of accepting orders in digital form.andP;  &quot;It will be much cheaper once wego electronic,&quot; Drew said.andM;AFLC officials had estimated AFTOMS to cost $250 million.andP;  JUSTIS programofficials are working up a new number to include the extra requirements ofthe Army and Navy, as well as developing a tri-service cost-benefit analysisto deliver to Pentagon officials.andM;Officials also are developing an acquisition strategy to be based on modulardevelopment, Drew said.andP;  He said the services will ask a single team ofcontractors to write a system that will run on existing computers.andM;&quot;It might be on Z-248s, Desktop III machines or 3B2 minis,&quot; Drew said,referring to three small computers now in use or available to the militaryunder requirements contracts with Zenith Data Systems Corp., Unisys Corp. andATandamp;T Co.andM;&quot;There might be a need for some support hardware like a mainframe or somedata storage or communications, to support getting the system down into unitlevel,&quot; Drew said.andP;  Configurations for accessing JUSTIS, he said, probablywill vary among the services or type of command, and whether orders are fortactical or strategic equipment.andM;But whoever the user is, officials expect JUSTIS to deliver big cost savingsthrough reductions in paper and storage space.andM;Officials in all three services are more positive about JUSTIS than mostother aspects of the CIM project.andP;  Many have said that only where systems arebeing started from scratch can DOD expect to accomplish major savings injoint services automation.andM;Such root issues as data element standardization can be worked out in thereal world through start-ups like JUSTIS.andP;  Drew said these issues can be veryspecific and yet reflect broad differences between how the services dobusiness.andM;For instance, Army and Air Force logisticians have always used the word&quot;store&quot; in their inventory management documents and systems.andP;  Because ofnautical tradition, Navy officials use &quot;stow.&quot;andP;  Such distinctions are smallbut have been part of the reason the services end up with incompatiblesystems, officials have said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
