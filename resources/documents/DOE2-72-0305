Series of representationsof extended conformal symmetry, associated with cosets of the form g/subx/ + h/sub m//h/sub m+y/, where the subscripts denote the level of theaffine algebra, and m runs over the positive integers, are discussed.Those theories possessing a field extending the conformal algebra ofweight eta, where 1andless;etaandless;2, are listed. The ability of various coset modelsto be supersymmetrised is established using these techniques. The conceptof a dual pair of cosets possessing related partition functions, butnot sharing the same extended conformal algebra, is developed.</TEXT></DOC>
