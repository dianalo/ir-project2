The 60-year-old De Mita put together a coalition of his party,the Socialists, Social Democrats, Republicans and Liberals, thesame five-party alliance that has governed Italy through most ofthe 1980s.   De Mita presented his choice for the 32-member Cabinet toPresident Francesco Cossiga at the Quirinal Palace.   Goria stepped down March 11 after eight turbulent months inoffice. His coalition was weakened by factional disputes in his ownChristian Democrat party as well as feuding with the Socialists,led by former Premier Bettino Craxi.   Leaders of the five parties agreed on the terms for the newgovernment Monday, and the parties met again separately Tuesday togive their final endorsement.   The crucial support came from the Socialists, the second-largestparty in the coalition and a frequent foil for the ChristianDemocrats, who have led or dominated all Italian governments sincethe end of World War II.   Most of De Mita's Cabinet members were holdovers from theprevious Goria government. They included Foreign Minister GiulioAndreotti, a Christian Democrat; Defense Minister Valerio Zanone, aLiberal; and Treasury Minister Giuliano Amato, a Socialist.   Gianni De Michelis, a Socialist, was given the post of deputypremier previously held by Amato.   Goria did not join the new government as a minister.   With De Mita holding both the premiership and his post assecretary of the Christian Democrat Party, at least for the timebeing, the government was viewed as potentially stronger thanGoria's coalition.   But Craxi said Tuesday he thought it would be a ``miracle'' ifDe Mita's government lasted through the end of the legislative termin 1992.   As required by the constitution, De Mita will seek a confidencevote in Parliament, where the coaliton holds a comfortable majorityin both houses. The vote is expected next week.   As a sign of the kind of problems De Mita could face,parliamentary deputies of the small Social Democrat Partyimmediately protested their party's choice of its two Cabinetministers.   De Mita cleared the final hurdle when the parties on Mondayagreed on proposed antitrust legislation for the Italian media.Under the accord, no individual or group can own or control both anewspaper and a television network.   The proposed law would also clear the way for live nationwidebroadcasts by private networks.   On the controversial issue of nuclear power, the parties put offa final decision on the fate of the unfinished nuclear plant atMontalto di Castro near Rome. The Socialists had demanded the plantbe reconverted to another form of energy, while the ChristianDemocrats favored completing the nuclear station.</TEXT></DOC>
