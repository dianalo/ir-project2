It was found that the maximum electrical conductivityof carbon films was obtained when the benzene flow rate was 7-8 ml/hr,the substrate was stainless-steel. The graphite film which was obtainedby the high temperature treatment of the carbon films at 3300 deg C hasthe electrical conductivity of 2.1x104 S/cm. The highest electrical conductivityof AsF/sub 5/ intercalated graphite films was 9x105 S/cm.</TEXT></DOC>
