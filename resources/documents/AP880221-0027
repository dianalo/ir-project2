WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   After sitting on the sidelines in Iowa and fallingshort of his aim in New Hampshire, Albert Gore Jr. has two weeks toshow that he too is a real contender for the Democraticpresidential nomination.   Gore, the Tennesse senator who has made much of his Southernroots, long ago crafted a Southern strategy for winning theDemocratic presidential nomination that is 100 percent dependent onachieving a breakthrough on one day.   That day, March 8, looms large now that the race for thenomination has moved to his turf. Twenty states hold Democraticdelegates contests then, including every state of the South saveone.   Gore's strategy flies in the face of the conventional wisdomthat, as in the past, to win the nomination a candidate in eitherparty must first score a success in the earliest contests of Iowaand New Hampshire.   To disprove that thinking, Gore must mount in the two weeksbefore Super Tuesday a campaign that appeals brodadly to Southernwhite voters _ since Jesse Jackson figures to take most of theblack vote.   And Gore must do so against the attention that naturally hasfallen on the Democratic race's two winners to date _ RichardGephardt, who won in Iowa, and Michael Dukakis, who won in NewHampshire.   It's no coincidence that those two rivals were the ones Goretargeted with a flurry of barbed attacks as quickly as the firstSouthern debate began in Dallas last Thursday.   ``He's got to make something happen,'' said a rival strategist,polltaker Ed Reilly of Gephardt's campaign.   Gephardt was more blunt: ``He probably thinks I'm ahead in theSouth and he's got to jump start his campaign to have a chance.''   Gore and his strategists have long contended he already had ``aticket to Super Tuesday'' because Gore is from the South andbecause he early on decided to forego Iowa's caucus system toconcentrate on the delegate-rich states that vote March 8. He hassought endorsements from Democratic officials to demonstrate he isthe region's choice, and has positioned himself to the right of hisrivals on defense and foreign policy issues.   ``We must do well on Super Tuesday _ there's no ifs, ands orbuts about it,'' Gore campaign manager Fred Martin said.   Yet at the same time, Gephardt and Dukakis roll into the Southwith the momentum their initial victories provide. Dukakis, thegovernor of Massachusetts, has an organization in place in theSouth that is well regarded, and Gephardt, a Missouri congressman,has honed a populist, protectionist message that has played wellwith blue-collar and conservative voters elsewhere and may do thesame with those voters in the South.   And after this Tuesday, one or both may have more victories topoint to from the smaller contests in South Dakota and Minnesota.   While Gore publicly was proclaiming all his bets were on theSouth, there were indications his forces hoped their quiet campaignin New Hampshire would allow him to slip into the pack of leaderswith a good showing. The Tennessee senator didn't spend the fullweek before New Hampshire's primary last Tuesday in that state, asdid his rivals, but Gore devoted a significant amount of attentionand money to the state. ``They did it very quietly,'' New Hampshireparty chairman Joe Grandmaison said.   Gore never predicted victory, but always said he had one aim:``Do a good deal better than people are expecting.''   He didn't. Gore finished fifth with 7 percent of the vote,besting only former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt, who quickly droppedout, and former Colorado Sen. Gary Hart, who most Democraticinsiders think should too. Gore as much as acknowledged his failurethere when asked about Jackson, whom he trailed in New Hampshire.   ``The truth of it is,'' Gore said, ``neither one of us did allthat well in New Hampshire.''   Had he run a surprising third, Gore would have come to the Southhaving already demonstrated he can command votes and runcompetitively outside his region.   Because it requires campaigning in a large region in littletime, television will dominate in the Southern campaign. Goreforces say they expect to spend at least $2 million to $3 million,and Dukakis is well positioned to match or exceed that.   While Gore has been working long and hard in the South, he wasdoing it at a time when some political analysts believe few peoplehad begun focusing on the presidential campaign _ except perhapsthose who happen to live in Iowa and New Hampshire.   ``We only started our TV ads a week ago, and all attention hasbeen on the early contests,'' Gore said.   The early contests are over now, and Al Gore has two weeks tolight some fires.</TEXT></DOC>
