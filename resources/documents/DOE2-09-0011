Thickness ofthe implanted layer, as well as doping concentration both in the emitterand in the base, have shown to be critical parameters for optimization.This process, which is feasible of high automation on an industrial scale,should allow considerable reduction in production costs. 4 figs., 8 refs.,1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
