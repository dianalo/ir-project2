AZT _ the only federally approved anti-AIDS drug _ can causemuscle aches, nausea, headaches and severe anemia. Additionally,medical experts have mixed opinions about using AZT, now known aszidovudine, to prevent infection after exposure.   Dr. Julie Gerberding of San Francisco General Hospital said sheis often asked whether the side effects of AZT outweigh the chancesof infection after a health worker is pricked with an AIDS-taintedneedle.   ``I've been bombarded with calls from health care workers aroundthe country,'' said Gerberding, who is directing a study on therisk of AIDS infection among health workers.   Researchers believe AZT may keep the AIDS virus from installingitself on the genetic material of cells if the drug is taken soonafter exposure, thus preventing AIDS infection. However, themedical community is split over whether the drug should beadministered before a patient develops AIDS symptoms.   Dr. Paul Volberding, an AIDS authority at San Francisco General,said the odds of AIDS infection in a health care worker with a deepcut who comes in contact with the virus may run as high as one in100. He said 22 health workers worldwide have become accidentallyinfected.   Last month, Burroughs Wellcome Co., the only maker of AZT, begana nationwide study of health workers accidentally exposed to thevirus.   Karen Collins, a spokeswoman for the drug company, said workersare required to enroll within five days of exposure. Half willreceive a six-week supply of the drug free of charge and half willget a placebo, she said.   Researchers at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda,Md., said Thursday they are seeking approval from the federal Foodand Drug Administration for a similar study that could start withina month. The NIH study, which would concentrate on workers facing``massive exposures'' to the virus, would not use placebos, saidDebbie Katz, who is coordinating the project.   Gerberding said she knew two workers at her hospital who tookAZT after being exposed to the AIDS virus through tainted blood.   William Owen, a doctor in private practice who treats AIDSpatients, said he prescribed the drug to a surgeon who cut his handwith a scalpel while operating on a patient with acquired immunedeficiency syndrome.   Since patients may acquire AZT through their personalphysicians, the number of people taking the drug as a preventivemeasure is not known.   ``Like everything else with AIDS, it's quasi-underground,'' saidDr. June Fisher, who runs the city's Center of MunicipalOccupational Safety and Health, a health clinic.   Volberding said he has enough faith in the drug's efficacy thathe could not in good conscience advise AIDS-exposed workers toenroll in the Burroughs Wellcome study because he'd be afraid theywould get the placebo.   However, Dr. Martin Hirsch of Massachusetts General Hospitalsaid if he was accidentally exposed to the virus he probably wouldenroll in the Burroughs Wellcome study rather than take the drug onhis own.</TEXT></DOC>
