So together we pulled out of a tailspin and created 17{ milliongood jobs. That's more than a quarter of a million new jobs a month_ every month _ for 68 consecutive months. America is workingagain. Just, and just since our 1984 convention, we have createdover 11 million of those new jobs. Now, just why would our friendson the other side want to change that? Why do they think puttingyou out of work is better than putting you to work?   New homes are being built. New car sales reached record levels.Exports are starting to climb again. Factory capacity isapproaching maximum use. You know, I've noticed they don't call it``Reaganomics'' anymore.   As, as for inflation _ well, that, too, has changed. We changedit from the time it hit 18 percent in 1980 _ down to between 3{ and4 percent. Interest rates are less than half of what they were. Infact, in fact nearly half of all mortgages taken out on familyhomes in 1986 and more than a third of those in 1987 were actuallyold loans being refinanced at the new, lower rates. Young familieshave finally been able to get some relief.   These, too, were our changes.   We rebuilt our armed forces. We liberated Grenada from thecommunists and helped return that island to democracy. We, westruck a firm blow against Libyan terrorism. We've seen the growthof democracy in 90 percent of Latin America. The Soviets have begunto pull out of Afghanistan. The bloody Iran-Iraq war is coming toan end. And for the first time in eight years we have the prospectsof peace in southwest Africa and the removal of Cuban and otherforeign forces from the region. And in the 2,765 days of ouradministration, not one inch of ground has fallen to the communists.   Today _ (crowd chants, ``Four more years'') _ today, today _(crowd continues chant) _ today, today we have the first treaty inworld history to eliminate an entire class of U.S. and Sovietnuclear missiles. We're working on the Strategic Defense Initiativeto defend ourselves and our allies against nuclear terror, andAmerican and Soviet relations are the best they've ever been sinceWorld War II.   And virtually all this change occurred _ and continues to occur_ in spite of the resistance of those liberal elites who loudlyproclaim that it's time for a change. They resisted our defensebuildup; they resisted our tax cuts; they resisted cutting the fatout of government; and they resisted our appointments of judgescommitted to the law and the Constitution.   And it's time for some more straight talk. This time it's aboutthe budget deficit. Yes, it's much too high. But the presidentdoesn't vote for a budget, and the president can't spend a dime.Only the Congress can do that. They blame, they blame the defenseincreases for the deficit, yet defense spending today, in realdollars, is almost exactly what it was six years ago. In a six-yearperiod, Congress cut defense spending authority by over $125billion. And for every $1 reduction in defense outlays, they added$2 to domestic spending. Now, if they had passed my first budget,my first spending plan in 1982, the cumulative outlays and deficitswould have been $207 billion lower by 1986.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
