At the same time, according to U.N. officials, politicalopposition is growing within the world body against expandingthe powers for international inspections, a move the U.S.believes will be needed to assure that nations such as Iraqand North Korea don't maintain clandestine nuclear weaponsprograms in the future.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We're sort of caught here,&quot; says Robert Gallucci, deputydirector of the special commission, which now must removeradioactive nuclear fuel from Iraq and begin destroying thecountry's vast stock of chemical weapons. These actions couldcost well in excess of $100 million.   Since it was created in April, the commission has mounted24 inspections of Iraq on a relative shoestring -- some $15million -- gathered from the U.N. and volunteer donationsfrom the U.S., Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Japan. The long-rangeplan, as outlined by the U.S., was to finance the commissionfrom the proceeds of oil sold by Iraq under conditionsimposed by the U.N.   So far, however, Iraq has refused to sell any oil.Meanwhile, U.N. inspectors have concluded that major parts ofIraq's nuclear weapons program may still be hidden. The mostdisturbing evidence is traces of highly enriched, ornuclear-weapons-grade, uranium that don't match the Frenchand Russian nuclear fuel that Iraq was known to have.   The traces may stem from faulty tests in U.S. weaponslaboratories, may mean that another nation has secretly givenIraq weapons-grade uranium, or could mean Iraq has a hiddennuclear reactor -- the traces contained U-236, a rare isotopecreated in nuclear reactors. Finding the cause &quot;is our No. 1priority right now,&quot; says Mr. Gallucci.   In its latest released report, the International AtomicEnergy Agency, the Vienna-based affiliate that is performingthe nuclear inspections for the U.N., outlined the sprawlingstructure of the Iraqi nuclear program. Called the &quot;PC-3Project,&quot; it resembles the U.S. World War II &quot;ManhattanProject,&quot; which spent billions of dollars exploring dozens ofcomplex industrial processes at the same time.   What the IAEA found is embarrassing to the agency becausefor years before the Gulf War its inspectors had visiteddesignated &quot;peaceful nuclear&quot; facilities, often locatedalongside PC-3 Project activities. They reported no trace ofthe vast, hidden program.   The Bush administration has come under fire from Rep. LesAspin, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, formounting what the Wisconsin Democrat calls a &quot;threat andforget&quot; approach to the Iraqi nuclear weapons program. &quot;Weneed to flood Iraq with inspectors&quot; and establish a base fortheir permanent presence in Iraq, Rep. Aspin argues.   But that will cost money and, at the moment, the U.N.Special Commission is running on nearly empty. As one U.S.official put it, &quot;It looks like we're going to have to go outand pass the hat again.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
