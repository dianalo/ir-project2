The GAO, the congressional auditing and investigative agency,told the Senate Banking Committee that regulators should place anyof the 350 insolvent institutions remaining open into receivershipwhenever necessary until a decision can be made to liquidate them ormerge them with stronger partners.   ``Of fundamental importance, these institutions must beeffectively isolated from the rest of the depository institutionsindustry to prevent them from competing with healthy institutions,''said Charles O. Bowsher, the head of the GAO.   ``Their operations must be limited to investing in high-gradesecurities, managing bad assets on their books and acceptingdeposits at prevailing market rates,'' he said. Bowsher said Sandamp;Lregulators should enlist help from state officials and from federalregulators of commercial banks to accomplish this task. He saidCongress must reach agreement as soon as possible on the Sandamp;L crisis,or this process could not get started.   ``We estimate that to fully pay for (deposit) insurance lossesand to put (the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.) back on asolid financial footing, it will cost at least $85 billion more thanFSLIC currently anticipates receiving in revenue over the next 10years,'' he said.   ``Delay will only increase this cost,'' Bowsher said.   Delay would also permit weak institutions to ``squander ournation's wealth on questionable economic endeavors,'' weaken theentire financial system because healthy institutions must match thehigh interest rates paid by weak thrifts, and create pressure onregulators to lower standards for the entire industry to accommodateweak Sandamp;Ls, he said.   Bowsher also said that Congress, while providing more money,should also reform the system and improve its methods of rescuingfailed Sandamp;Ls.   He said the FSLIC should be made independent of its parentagency, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, and that healthy andunhealthy Sandamp;Ls should be put into separate insurance funds so thattougher rules can fairly be applied to the good Sandamp;Ls right away.   Bowsher, whose agency is studying last year's rescue of 205 Sandamp;Lsat an estimated cost of $31 billion, said, ``We have seriousreservations about the way the bank board proceeded.''   He said the bank board relies too heavily on methods thatpreserve cash and spread the cost of any rescues over 10 years.   ``It is questionable whether many of these mergers really savethe government money compared to other options that would bepossible if FSLIC had the money to resolve cases,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
