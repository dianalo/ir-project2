Newspapers and politicians said the elections strengthened thenational five-party coalition of Christian Democrat Premier CiriacoDe Mita, confirmed a political shift to the center, and signalledcontinuing movement on the left from the Communists toward theSocialists.   According to final returns from municipal elections Sunday andMonday, the Christian Democrats took 36.8 percent of the vote, upfrom 35.6 percent in the last local voting in 1983 and 34.9 percentin last June's parliamentary elections.   The Socialists made the biggest gains, recording 18.3 percent,compared to 15.3 percent in 1983 and 14.2 percent last summer.   The Communists, Italy's second largest party and the biggestCommunist party in the West, got 21.9 percent, a big drop from the25.8 percent of 1983 and 26.8 percent of last June.   Seven million people, about one-fifth of Italy's electorate,were eligible to vote Sunday and Monday in the elections for citycouncils in 1,200 cities and towns, and governments in threeprovinces.   The final turnout was put at 86.2 percent.   The vote was not expected to affect the balance of power on thenational scene, but it gave an indication of the political climatejust over a month since De Mita formed Italy's 48th post-wargovernment _ a five-party coalition of Christian Democrats,Socialists, Social Democrats, Republicans and Liberals.   Rome's left-leaning La Repubblica, Italy's largest newspaper,said in a front-page editorial, ``The real political result is thecrossing of votes on the left between the Communists andSocialists, the start of a rebalancing of the Italian left.''   The Christian Democrats, who have dominated Italy's post-warpolitics, noted that it was the first time since 1970 that theyhave increased their percentage over the previous local election.   Another significant result was the poor showing of the far-rightneofascist Italian Social Movemement, which slipped to 3.9 percentfrom 5 percent in 1983 and 6.8 in the national election last summer.   La Repubblica said the losses of the Communists and thefar-right were evidence that ``like in all economically maturecountries, our electorate is moving to the center of the politicalsphere and abandoning the areas further away from the point ofbalance.''</TEXT></DOC>
