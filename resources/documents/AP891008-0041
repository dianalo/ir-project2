The failed coup against Panamanian strongman Ge. Manuel AntonioNoriega was regarded within the White House as the first crisistest for Bush, and officials at the highest level were distressedby mistakes in intelligence gathering, coordination and otherproblems.   ``We're not happy. Our procedures, and in some cases someorganizational things, ought to be improved as a result of it, andwe will be doing that,'' White House national security adviserBrent Scowcroft said Sunday on the ABC-TV program ``This Week WithDavid Brinkley.''   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said that ``given everything thatwas available to us then, and given what I know now, I still thinkwe made the right decision.''   Paraphrasing the president, Secretary of State James A. BakerIII said that ``with 20-20 hindsight, I can't think of anything Iwould do differently than what I did.''   Bush was adamant in defending his decision not to intervenemilitarily to unseat Noriega. ``I'm not just being stubborn but asI look at all the information I wouldn't have made a differentdecision then,'' he said last week.   Aside from being a learning experience, the episode was adramatic reminder of the limits on U.S. influence in othercountries. It was a painful experience for Bush, who had encouragedthe Panama Defense Forces to rise up against their leader but thendecided to stay on the sidelines, refusing to authorize action byany of the 12,000 U.S. military forces in Panama.   Bush did not hide his frustration that Noriega was still inpower. ``Disappointed that Noriega's still there? Yes I am,'' hesaid.   Republicans joined Democrats in flaying the administration. Inone of the toughest criticisms, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y.,called the administration's handling of the coup as ``an incrediblestain on us'' and called White House statements a ``weak-kneedexplanation for failure.''   The chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Sen. DavidBoren, D-Okla., criticized the administration Sunday for notplanning in advance what aid it would give Panamanian militaryofficers who might attempt a coup.   ``Every time there has been a witness before our committee, wehave asked again and again and again, if we start to take action,are we prepared to see it through?'' Boren said on ABC.   ``Since George Bush became president, every single word ofauthority that he had requested from the intelligence committee andevery single penny that he has requested from the intelligencecommittee relating to Panama, he has gotten and gotten with mysupport,'' Boren said.   Scowcroft immediately challenged Boren's contention, butdeclined to give specifics, saying the details were secret.   ``Senator Boren over the last year, his contribution to suchthings, leaves me kind of astonished that he would say that,'' saidScowcroft. ``We did not get everything we had wanted.''   Much of the congressional criticism of the president's handlingof the crisis stemmed from the shifting administration version ofevents.   Did rebel forces ever offer to turn over Noriega to the UnitedStates?   Baker, Cheney and Scowcroft on Sunday all repeatedadministration assertions that the rebels refused to hand overNoriega, and even questioned whether they ever had him in custody.   But late last week administration officials acknowledged that acable was sent to Washington saying that the rebels wanted to givehim up. The word `want' should have read `won't,' officialsinsisted.   Did the United States take part in the coup attempt?   The White House at first insisted there was no involvement, thenacknowledged that U.S. troops were deployed along key accessroutes, at the rebels' request, to block forces loyal to Noriegafrom reaching his headquarters.   ``They would have been stopped,'' White House press secretaryMarlin Fitzwater said, when asked if U.S. forces would haveintercepted Noriega reinforcements.   Fitzwater also recanted his original claim that the UnitedStates had not been in touch with coup leaders before the uprising.In fact, he said U.S. officials had advance discussions with coupleader Maj. Moises Giroldi.   U.S. officials originally said the United States had beenreluctant to take direct action in the coup because of doubts aboutGiroldi, who was known as a Noriega confidant and had helped putdown an earlier coup.   On Sunday, Cheney repeated that he at first feared the coup was``setup.''   Giroldi was killed in the coup, perhaps by Noriega himself. Inretrospect, Fitzwater said, ``We think it (the coup) was legitimatenow.''   Confusion is endemic to such situations, he said.   ``It's because that's the nature of coups,'' he insisted.``There is conflicting information. This whole thing happened in asix-hour period and (there are) people running all over ... It'sthe ambiguity of the coup itself, as is true of all coups, thatcaused the conflict of information.''</TEXT></DOC>
