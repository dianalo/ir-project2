discussed but not used.andP;  A third group, however, has forsome time known and used a combination of sophisticated windowing softwareand an object-oriented development platform - Actor.andM;As time passes, programmers struggle against increasing complexity of boththe programming environment and the code that they are producing.andP;  This hasnever been more true than today, with the emergence of windowing systems as abasic standard.andP;  Many a C programmer must have wished for a return to thequick, straightforward 'Hello World' approach to programming.andP;  Have you trieddisplaying 'Hello World' in a Windows window using C and the SDK?andP;  It's nosmall task.andP;  The Actor equivalent, on the other hand, takes all of threelines.andP;  It is shown in Figure 1.andM;The StageandM;Actor is a single-inheritance object-oriented language.andP;  As with anyobject-oriented language, the act of programming is about creating instancesof classes.andP;  Classes can have instance and class variables and a set of classand instance methods - no surprises here.andP;  Unlike the purest OOP setups,there are if .andP;  .  then .andP;  .  .  else, select, and loop while .andP;  .  .  beginstructures.andM;Actor provides full, thought-out access to DOS and the BIOS.andP;  A CStruct classallows programmers to define complex objects for communicating with C codevia the DLL interface, using familiar C structure definitions.andP;  You can evendefine your own 'primitives'.andP;  These are methods written in optimisedassembly language.andM;So, as you can see, the system supports a wide range of levels ofabstraction, starting from assembler, through BIOS and DOS calls to Clibraries, to simple basic classes, to Windows functions, to abstract classlibraries.andP;  There are few development systems that could hope to rival suchflexibility.andM;The PlayandM;The system is distributed on both four 5.25 inch 360 KB disks and two 3.5inch (two 720 KB disks).andP;  Its minimum requirement is an ordinary PC/XT withgraphics card and 640 KB, but it won't be much fun on less than a 286 with atleast 1 MB.andP;  There is a simple, non-Windows installation program, which asksfor the target directory and unpacks the files from the disks (to reduce thenumber of distribution diskettes, and in line with current common practice,ZOO archives are used on the distribution disks).andM;Actor's programming environment is sophisticated and shamelessly borrows manyfeatures from Smalltalk.andP;  For example, as with Smalltalk, the sytem saves thecomplete programming environment (with all the global variables, open windowsetc) in an image, to be restored when the image file is next loaded.andP;  Thiscontracts with conventional programming systems, such as interpretive BASIC,where only program text is saved from the environment.andP;  As with Smalltalk,this high degree of integration of program with environment complicates thebusiness of creating stand-alone applications.andM;Figures 2 shows a typical Actor screen (note that it doesn't use the MDIguide-line).andP;  Open windows include the browser, and inspector, the workspace,a debugger and the Actor Display (the parent window).andM;BrowserandM;The browser is perhaps the most used tool.andP;  It allows the class hierarchies,variables and methods to be displayed, examined and altered.andP;  Classes can bearranged either alphabetically or hierarchically.andP;  It is somewhat lesssophisticated than its Smalltalk ancestor, having no class and methodcategories.andP;  These were merely organisational aids, but I miss them!andO;Selecting a class name automatically updates the related windows in thebrowser, displaying the instace and class variables and the methods.andO;Selecting a method brings its source code up in the editing window, where itmay be amended and the 'Accepted' or abandoned (you cannot leave the systemor inspect another class without doing one of these - but you can, however,have multiple browsers).andM;Inspectors can be invoked for any selected object, and allows the contents ofthat object to be examined and changed.andP;  They are especially useful forcomplex objects, where separate inspectors can be created to viewsub-components.andM;The debugger allows you to inspect program execution via an execution stack.andO;The stack displays the current messages, you can select the point at whichyou wish to check the program flow.andP;  Selecting an item in the execution stackdisplays the method (Smalltalk also highlighted the point which the methodhad reached, I really miss that) and the variables.andP;  You can inspec, changeand resume execution from any point in the stack.andM;The other two windows are the workspace and the Actor Display.andP;  The formercontains the menus and invokes the various tools and allows the programmer totry out messages in a quick and usually dirty fashion.andP;  The Display lets youswitch between windows and seal of applications ('sealing off' is the processof creating stand-alone.andP;  EXE files).andM;There are two other tools that are not in everyday use.andP;  Once an applicationis ready, there is a simple profiler that can tell the programmer whichmethods are called and how often, enabling him to carry out selectiveoptimisation if required.andP;  For the really keen, there is also a low-leveldebugger.andP;  This only works with sealed off applications, and is operated viaa terminal connected to a comms port.andP;  It then proceeds to fill the screenwith meaningful data about program execution (says the manual) - myexperience suggested that this tool was strictly for real programmers only!andM;ClassesandM;One criticism of many current object-oriented products is the lack of classlibraries.andP;  Not a complaint against Actor.andP;  The basic system comes with anextensive set of classes, including Collections, Windows support, exampleapplications, and many more.andP;  Two 'bonus' class categories supplied with thebasic system illustrate the careful attention that has been paid to classes.andM;The YaccMachine and Parse classes allow you to define your own specialisedlanguage for applications.andP;  A Turtle language grammer specification isincluded as an example.andP;  To use this feature properly, however, it isnecessary to have access to a yacc (to generate the grammar state tables inC) and nearly essential to have access to awk (for converting the yacc outputto Actor format).andM;There is also a set of classes supporting 'Frames'.andP;  There are three coreclasses: Frame (a dictionary of Slot objects), Slot (a dictionary of facets -#value, #default etc) and FrameList (a dictionary of all frames used in anapplication).andP;  They support AKO (a-kind-of) relations and the algorithm foranswering questions (using the chain of AKOs and rules for defaults etc) issophisticated, and can be tailored if required.andP;  There are even detailedsuggestions for extending the power of these classes.andM;However, as anyone who has been involved in developing a set of generalpurpose classes will know, it can be hard work finding the right groundbetween abstraction and utility.andP;  Whitewater has taken the horse by the mouth(sic) and produced a really comprehensive and easy-to-use set of graphicsclasses, called ObjectGraphics.andP;  These are sold separately to Actor, butshould really be considered as an essential for anyone considering graphicswork.andP;  Indeed, the ability to use these classes could be considered thebiggest improvement between V2.0 and V3.0 of Actor.andM;ObjectGraphics offers a wide variety of sophisticated 2D graphics facilities.andO;There is a large scale program, in sealed off from (OBJDRAW.EXE and an imageOBJDRAW.IMA) with the class library.andP;  ObjectGraphics changes some of theexisting Actor classes as well as adding new ones.andP;  The manual is at pains toshow just what classes are affected (to avoid inadvertently destroying anywork you have done if you are loading into anything other than a virginimage).andP;  To use these classes ACTOR.EXE must also be modified using theresource compiler, RC.EXE (supplied with Actor andandM;in the RES directory after installation) to include the additional resourcesrequired.andP;  Then simply load the files in the OGX.LOD file (using the load(&quot;ogx.lod&quot;) message).andM;The example program has a dual role.andP;  First, and most obviously it is anextended, sophisticated example that uses nearly all the ObjectGraphicsclasses.andP;  The manual suggests that, by extending the program with your ownadditions, you can use it as a test platform.andP;  It is also a 'screen painter':you can draw up a screen with sophisticated graphics and custom shaped'button' objects and import the result into your applications.andP;  Your programscan manipulate the graphical objects that constitute the picture (eg performhit checks).andP;  This saves a lot of time and code - it is even possible fornon-programmers to create screens.andP;  The system is flexible (screen appearancecan easily be changed) and is very simple to use, but loses none of the powerrequired by programmers.andP;  Additionally Whitewater claims that programsdeveloped in Actor based on ObjectGraphic's classes will be portable acrossother 'supported platforms' (ie OS/2 PM soon-ish, and possibly, one day, theMacintosh).andM;How does ObjectGraphics approach the problem of portability across windowingplatforms?andP;  With rendering tools, platform filters (or 'ports') and graphics.andO;Rendering tools control text (font, size and style), line width, colour, andso on.andP;  All graphics objects use rendering tools to draw themselves.andP;  A'Port' is the generic output device (eg a printer, a Windows window or a PMwindow).andP;  Graphic objects are the things that render themselves within portsusing rendering tools.andM;A Doodle-type sample program, called SampleDraw, provides example use of the30 new classes, and gets the programmer into ObjectGraphics straight away.andO;The manual invites you to change the sample program to manipulate otherobjects.andP;  This really showed the power of the classes: it was possible tomodify the program (which, as supplied, only drew lines) to support ellipses,rounded rectangles, rectangles and pies.andP;  All the new shapes inherited theexisting width and colour options.andP;  the complete program contained no morethan a handful of lines of code, and I completed the modifications to supportthe extra shapes in a matter of minutes.andP;  Figure 3 shows a code fragmentwhich allows the operator to draw a shape by 'dragging' it on the screen.andO;The sequence illustrates the handling of three messages: beginDrag, drag andendDrag.andM;DocumentationandM;The quality of the manuals is very high, with pathways for both experiencedand new Actor programmers.andP;  There are sections on what object-orientedprogramming is, and how to do simple object-oriented design.andP;  There is anearly focus on the typical Actor development cycle (to familiarise theprogrammer with the tools).andP;  Smalltalk programmers who have bother to readthese early sections will experience a sense of deja vu - the examples,business chart and account browser seem to come straight from the OrangeBook.andP;  The manual goes into great detail about Windows resources and theircreation, whether with RC, dynamically or the Whitewater ResourceConstruction Set (which was itself written in Actor).andP;  Each of the majorclasses is introduced.andP;  The documentation then treats the Windows objects indetail, and also covers the sealing off process (creating .EXEs) and projectmanagement.andP;  The manuals are more than a tutorial - they are also anexcellent reference for the experiences user.andM;ProblemsandM;The system is not perfect.andP;  It lacks the more sophisticated browser from theSmalltalk environment.andP;  Surely, more than 10 years on, it should be possibleto do better than the basic Smalltalk tool set.andP;  Under earlier versions ofWindows, it was not possible to clutter up the browser with classes (theresimply wasn't enough memory).andP;  Now it is different.andP;  Some class categories,or some more advanced method, are desirable.andP;  Project filters (allowing onlycertain classes to be viewed within a specified project) would be helpful, aswould be the ability to allocate classes to projects dynamically.andP;  The manualshould stress the role of project support in the environment more, as a classlibrarian is essential in any OOP based project.andM;The memory management scheme is still a little strange.andP;  Could we not justhave a single homogeneous 16 MB address space?andP;  Neow (UK distributor) saysthat the forthcoming '32-bit kernel' will address this problem - but perhapsonly for the OS/2 PM version.andM;The installation program should be Windows-based (I don't want to be remindedthat MS-DOS exists).andP;  However, it is very painless and certainly one of thebetter examples of the variety.andM;Does Actor replace the Windows SDK?andP;  Not completely.andP;  There is not enoughdetailed explanation of Windows internals to be able to create novelcombinations of existing Windows features.andP;  Two examples spring to mind.andP;  TheMDI interface is mentioned only briefly; the ACtor developer is referred tothe SDK for more information.andP;  The support for DDE is primitive.andP;  It would bevery difficult to improve this stae of affairs without more extensive Windowsreference.andP;  Whitewater is reputedly able to supply some classes on theunderstanding that they are not officially supported yet - (available 'realsoon now').andM;The Actor system does not stand alone.andP;  Whitewater has provided a full set ofcomplementary tools.andP;  The ObjectGraphics tool, discussed above, allowscomplex graphics to be defined and used in programs.andP;  A Resource Toolkit aidsthe creation of dialog boxes, bitmaps etc.andP;  For database programmers, thereis Wintrieve, an ISAM file manage which acts as a server for multipleapplications offering unlimited numbers of indexes for each file.andP;  All codeproduced by these tools can be included royalty-free with your program.andM;ConclusionandM;I believe that Actor can contribute effectively in four main areas.andP;  Itfeatures prominently in many large corporations programming efforts(Whitewater claims to have developed it as a product suitable for Fortune 100companies).andP;  Like Smalltalk, it is ideal for rapid prototyping.andP;  However, itis clearly designed to produce 'real' programs.andP;  I am sure that, as timepasses, it will be seen more and more as a mainstream development tool,especially in the hands of those writing for vertical markets.andP;  There isanother role for Actor: it is a wonderful vehicle for those wishing to learnWindows.andP;  The interactive environment makes it an ideal way of experimentingwith the system.andM;There are many other Actor features that I have not mentioned.andP;  It isapparent that Actor is mature, extensible and up to the task - it could besaid to be in a class of its own (geddit).andP;  If you need to do Windowsprogramming, I believe that there has never been a better time or a betterway!andP;  If you are not doing Windows programming, why not?andM;Joe Borkoles is a Research Scientist at the HCI Group, Queen Mary andWestfield College, London University.andP;  He has himself used Actor in anger,while developing a multi-media training package.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
