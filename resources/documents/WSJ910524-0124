Pacific Trading Cards Inc., for instance, made a bundleduring the Persian Gulf crisis selling Operation DesertShield cards depicting modern weaponry and gung-ho soldiersmassed for battle.</LP><TEXT>   But now the Lynnwood, Wash., maker of baseball-styletrading cards has a new hero to promote: Nolan Ryan, the44-year-old Texas Rangers pitching phenomenon, who justhurled his seventh no-hitter.   The public's demand for war-related cards &quot;is just not asoverwhelming as it was a month ago,&quot; says Michael Cramer,Pacific Trading's president. &quot;How many ways can you slice thesame thing and still make people interested in it?&quot;   That's precisely the problem facing the scores of peopletrying to make a buck off the war. The war produced ablizzard of advertisements, novelty items and books playingto excitement over the military triumph, and another batch isblowing in as marketers try to take advantage of thepatriotic fervor surrounding Memorial Day and the Fourth ofJuly. But many experts warn that the public's interest isalready waning, and that could mean big trouble for companiesthat don't pull the plug soon enough.   &quot;There's no question that the war has faded in theconsciousness of Americans,&quot; says Frank Newport, editor inchief of the Gallup Poll.   &quot;The glow is gone and we're back to real life with budgetdeficits and bad unemployment figures,&quot; says Jeffrey B.Hirsch of Hirsch Marketing, Venice, Calif., consultants. &quot;I'mnot sure the war was really won. {Saddam} Hussein is stillthere and genocide is occurring. The glow is probably gonebecause it was a hollow victory.&quot; Mr. Hirsch said he wouldn'tadvise clients to ride on the war's coattails.   Milton Somberg, president of Morris Rothenberg andamp; Son Inc.,found out about the waning demand the hard way. Although hesays sales of desert-pattern camouflage uniforms are stillstrong at the Smithtown, N.Y., distributor of militaryproducts, most novelty items -- ranging from Desert Stormsweat shirts to license plate frames -- are stashed in acorner. &quot;You can't give that stuff away,&quot; he says.   That kind of talk makes the book industry nervous.Publishers have released dozens of books on the war and planto issue at least 30 more in the next several months. Sometomes already in stores have done well: &quot;The Commanders,&quot; abehind-the-scenes look at the Pentagon's role in the Panamainvasion and the Mideast war by Bob Woodward, is abest-seller. And Albert Hourani, emeritus fellow at St.Anthony's College, Oxford, sold 60,000 copies of &quot;The Historyof the Arab Peoples.&quot;   Publishing executives say those books sell well becausethey hit the streets quickly and offered analytical andhistorical insights into the conflict not available in mediareports.   But books that haven't come out yet face more of astruggle, especially if they weren't written by a well-knownauthor.   Anne Kubek, general manager of Borders Book Shop inRockville, Md., says a number of photo books labeled ascommemorative editions haven't been selling. Likewise, mostre-releases of older books about the region, maps of theMiddle East, and &quot;instant&quot; books about the war quickly losttheir popularity once the war ended.   &quot;Time marches on and the American attention span is notalways that great,&quot; says Gayle Feldman, trade news editor forPublishers Weekly.   That may be why Random House is hurrying to produce&quot;Triumph in the Desert,&quot; a commemorative book withphotographs and essays by well-known journalists. The unit ofAdvance Publications Inc. plans to release 90,000 copies byMemorial Day.   It's going to take longer -- until the spring of 1993 --for Peter Arnett's autobiography to be released. Mr. Arnett,whose broadcasts from Baghdad made him a household name, willearn $1.5 million to $2 million in deals with ParamountCommunications Corp.'s Simon andamp; Schuster and foreignpublishers. &quot;While the U.S. public has a short memory,there's enough happening {in the Middle East} to keep thememory very much alive,&quot; he says.   Still, there are signs that interest is already flaggingin that other gold mine for instant celebrities: the lecturecircuit.   During and immediately following the war, militaryexperts, journalists and foreign affairs specialists wereflooded with offers to share their experiences with thepublic. Retired Lt. Gen. Thomas Kelly, for instance, wasbooked into nearly 70 speaking engagements stretching into1992 for fees as high as $25,000 a speech.   But lately, says Don R. Epstein, chief executive officerof Greater Talent Network Inc., a New York-based speakersbureau, &quot;except for several key players in the war, theSchwarzkopfs and the Powells, people aren't that interestedin the topic any longer.&quot;   Now, says Mr. Epstein, meeting planners &quot;want me to findthe guy who can tell them how to weather the recession andmake money in the process.&quot;   As for videos, immediately after the war MPI Home Video, amanufacturer and distributor of pre-recorded videocassettesin Oak Forest, Ill., scored a hit with an ABC Newsvideocassette of Gen. Schwarzkopf's military briefing of thevictory. Nearly 200,000 copies were sold to distributors andretailers, says Jaffer Ali, MPI's vice president ofmarketing. In recent weeks, CBS Inc.'s news division, TurnerBroadcasting System Inc.'s Cable News Network and IndependentTelevision News of Britain produced new videocassettedocumentaries of the war and its aftermath, costing from$14.98 to $49.98.   Sales figures aren't available for those, but Mr. Alibelieves sales have peaked and will likely start decliningafter July 4.   Meanwhile, television viewers and newspaper readers canexpect a slew of patriotic spots in coming weeks, pegged toMemorial Day and the Fourth of July holidays. But theadvertisements aren't expected to last much longer than that.   For example, a campaign launched several weeks ago for DHLWorldwide Express included a print ad that shows DHL &quot;madeheadlines&quot; in a national newspaper when the air expresscompany continued Middle East service during the war. ButLynn Upshaw, executive vice president of Ketchum Advertisingin San Francisco, which developed the ad, said the ad's daysare numbered. &quot;People are concerned again about the economyand crime,&quot; he says. &quot;It's just that one topic replacesanother . . . and advertising takes its lead from the eventsof the day.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
