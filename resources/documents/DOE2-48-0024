The mineral-wool industry is stable with a slightly decliningmarket. Of its market segments, only commercial acoustic insulation (whichis currently dominant) is likely to be affected by growth in the nextten years. The principal process is based on treatment of blast-furnaceslags in a cupola furnace using coke as the fuel and reducing agent.Expanded use of gas, as a substitute for coke, would eliminate environmentalproblems and expand the latitude of suitable raw materials. The studyprovides insights into the mineral-wool industry and identifies factorsthat may constitute bases for future usage of natural gas.</TEXT></DOC>
