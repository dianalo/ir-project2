It was the 11thstraight day of massive protests in Czechoslovakia.   Huge crowds of workers also poured into the streets ofBratislava, the east Slovak industrial center of Kosice, the miningcenter of Ostrava on the Polish border, and in Usti nad Labem, theheart of industrial north Bohemia.   The showing was a resounding victory for the opposition, whichhad called the two-hour strike a referendum on the Communists'40-year monopoly on power.   Communist leaders' frantic attempts to avert the strike failed,as workers joined the pro-democracy movement started by students,artists and intellectuals.   Shaken leaders continued to make new concessions to theopposition:   _ The party's Central Committee dumped three more hard-linersfrom the ruling Politburo, the second major leadership reshuffle inthree days.   _ The Czech and Slovak ministries of culture announced they hadlifted most forms of press censorship.   _ The Central Committee approved an inquiry by a parliamentarycommission into a Nov. 17 rally in which riot police clubbedhundreds of peaceful pro-democracy demonstrators.   _ Deputy premier Jaromir Zak said on state TV that after longdiscussion, it was decided to drop the article enshrining theleading role of the Communists in the constitution from a new draftof the document. ``Every political party has the right to a leadingrole as long as it is based on results,'' he said. ``It's notpossible to lay this down in the constitution.''   _ The official CTK news agency said parliament, until now arubber-stamp body under firm Communist control, also would be opento discussion of any draft laws. Vladimir Janku, head of thestate's commission on church affairs, was quoted as saying thesewould include new laws on religion that would end state controlover churches and the criticized practice of licensing priests.   But there were still more conditions to be met. Postersdemanding free elections and an end to one-party rule wereplastered over the windows of shops, hotels and restaurants thatclosed to observe the strike.   At Prague's largest industrial complex, CKD, workers demandedthe formation of independent trade unions.   Hundreds of thousands of joyous workers streamed into the city'scenter, carrying banners of their factories, firms and offices inan outpouring of national pride and support for democratic reforms.Sirens howled and church bells pealed as the strike began at noon.   ``Look Gustav, how thick the crowd is!'' the people chanted,referring to President Gustav Husak, the man who headed thecrackdown on democratic reforms after a Warsaw Pact invasion in1968.   ``Dubcek to the Castle!'' they yelled, referring to AlexanderDubcek, the ousted leader of the failed ``Prague Spring'' reformswho was replaced as party leader by Husak. Hradcany Castle, anational symbol, is the presidential residence.   ``It has to go to the very end,'' said Jana Cervenkova, who wasamong the demonstrators. ``As long as the Communists rule, it'sgoing to be messed up as it was for the last 40 years.''   More than 200,000 people attended another mass rally in PragueMonday afternoon, continuing the series of protests that haveyielded major government concessions to opposition demands.   Vaclav Klaus, a spokesman for the opposition group Civic Forum,called off any rallies for Tuesday, when the opposition meets thegovernment for more negotiations. Communist Premier Ladislav Adamecon Sunday held an unprecedented meeting with opposition leaders totry to contain the peaceful revolt.   ``Demands of the Civic Forum have been met in principle or arebeing met,'' Klaus said. But he warned that the rallies wouldresume if negotiators fail to make progress toward democraticreforms.   ``The fundamental condition in our talks is the holding of freeelections,'' Klaus told the crowd.   Valtr Komarek, the head of the Forecasting Institute of theAcademy of Sciences, branded the current orthodox Communist system``a message from the valley of shadows.''   Actors and students groups in Prague and Bratislava, capital ofSlovakia, have proposed that Komarek be named premier.   State TV, which has played a key role in the dizzyingly rapidpopular revolt, broadcast footage from industrial centers aroundthe country, showing crowds of hundreds of thousands attendingstrike rallies.   State radio said all enterprises were affected by the strike,although most had skeleton crews on duty so that production wouldnot be halted completely.   In Bratislava, dissident Milan Simecka read a message fromVaclav Havel, the nation's most prominent opposition leader, whosaid ``have no fear, the future is ours.''   When a speaker at the rally mentioned Dubcek, the crowd of100,000 people responded with a deafening roar.   Dubcek has made a dramatic political comeback after two decadesof political exile, addressing huge crowds four days running inPrague and his native Bratislava.   In another development, exiled actor Pavel Landovsky and writerPavel Kohout were allowed into the country for the first time inmore than 10 years and addressed the people gathered in downtownBratislava.   In Plzen, about 60 miles southwest of Prague, workers at thegigantic Skoda heavy machinery works ignored management appeals toremain on plant property and joined a crowd of demonstratorsdowntown, state radio reported.</TEXT></DOC>
