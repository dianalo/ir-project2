In December, the maker of products for the railroad, construction equipment and materials handling industries said it would post a loss of about $15.5 million from a restructuring of its business operations, which will include the sale of assets.    In 1986, Portec earned $1.4 million, or 51 cents a share, on sales of $113.6 million. The 1986 results included a gain of $2.8 million from a pension plan termination, which offset a $1.5 million loss from continuing operations.    Portec previously said that as a result of the restructuring, it expects to be profitable in 1988.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Portec's shares closed at $5.875, unchanged. </TEXT></DOC>
