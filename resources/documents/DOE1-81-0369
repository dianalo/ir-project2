It can accelerateheavy ion beam with charge to mass ratio of 1/2 up to the energy of 450MeV/u and the maximum magnetic rigidity is designed at 7 Tcenter dotm.The focusing structure is based on simple FODO lattice, while the longstraight section is designed to have smooth structure of beta and dispersionfunctions like doublet system. The main magnet system is composed of24 dipole and 18 quadrupole magnets. These magnets are fabricated withstacked laminated cores 0.5 mm in thickness with inorganic insulationlayers at both surfaces. The dipole magnets with gap height of 80 mmand core length of 1000 mm are made with H-type. The quadrupole magnetswith bore radius of 65 mm and core length of 200 mm have hyperbolic poleshape which is smoothly connected to its tangential lines at both sides.Field properties of all these magnets have already been studied in detailand they are now being aligned to their proper positions with the precisionof 0.1 mm, reflecting the results of field measurements from beam dynamicalpoint of view.</TEXT></DOC>
