Herewith introduced is a case study of practicalmeasure of efficiency improvement for the turbine and the condenser.(2) Trend of large unit capacity. Technological history of enlarginga capacity of thermal generation units and a case study are briefly described.(3) Package units as portable turbine generator. Developmental statusand economy are summarized on the portable type turbine which can betransported by a trailer and operated, in order for the economy of smalland medium sized geothermal power generation plant. (4) Optimum operatingsystem in geothermal power station with consideration of steam productionand reinjection. Summary is made on the plant types, heat cycle types,and plant troubles caused by scale. (5) Development of Geothermal BinaryCycle Generation Plant. Summary is made on the developmental status andeconomy in Japan. ( 30 figs, 2 tabs )</TEXT></DOC>
