Section 1953.20 provides that where any alterationin the Federal program could have an adverse impact on the at least aseffective status of the State program, a program change supplement to aState plan shall be required.In response to Federal standards changes, the State has submitted by lettersdated April 15, 1987 and January 12, 1988 from Jim Sampson, Commissioner,to James W. Lake, Regional Administrator, and incorporated as part of theplan, a State standard and amendment comparable to 29 CFR 1910.120, HazardousWaste Operations and Emergency Response; Interim Final Rule, as publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (51 FR 45663) on December 19, 1986; and Corrections,as published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (52 FR 16241) on May 4, 1987.The State's Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response Code, whichis contained in Subchapter 10, was adopted on May 19, 1987, and becameeffective June 19, 1987.
