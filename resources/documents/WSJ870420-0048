But the EPA told the court that it will bar imports of EDB-tainted mangoes after Sept. 30; and one of the three judges issuing the ruling, Joyce Hens Green, said any softening of that position would be &quot;unacceptable.&quot;    The agency banned EDB in the U.S. in 1983 based on evidence that it may cause cancer. But, pressured by the State Department to soften the impact on growers in Mexico, Haiti, Belize and Guatemala until they could find a substitute to EDB, the agency made a temporary exception for mango importers.    On Jan. 16, the appeals court denounced that action as arbitrary and capricious. In a suit brought by an environmental group, the court said the EPA action by law had to be based on the protection of the American public, rather than on foreign policy considerations. But instead of banning the imports, the court gave the agency time to justify its action. The EPA won over the court by arguing that banning all mango imports treated with EDB would undermine foreign cooperation with U.S. food-safety standards.    EPA deputy administrator James Barnes said this would pose a greater risk to the U.S. public than tolerating tainted mango imports for a short time. </TEXT></DOC>
