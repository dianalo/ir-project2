Hard-line states such as Nigeria and Zimbabwe issued predictablestatements endorsing sanctions and urging no leniency toward thePretoria government.   But Gabon's President Omar Bongo, basking in the euphoriasurrounding Mandela's release Sunday after more than 27 years inprison, declared it ``a triumph for dialogue over cannons andguns.''   ``We need to review our relations with South Africa, tore-establish diplomatic ties, even if we do not send ambassadors,''Bongo said in a radio broadcast.   His declaration indicated a growing chasm in black Africa'soften hypocritical stand on South Africa.   Most African countries trade with Pretoria, but few openlyacknowledge the economic links made more attractive recently by theweakened South African currency and some states' over-valuedcurrencies, particularly those French-speaking Africa.   The Ivory Coast, reported to be considering diplomatic relationswith Pretoria, urged a new approach to President F.W. de Klerk'sgovernment.   ``The time has come for Africa to end its current opposition (tothe South African goverment) and to encourage and support theefforts of President de Klerk,'' said Foreign Minister Simeon Ake.   President Felix Houphouet-Boigny sent a telegram to Mandelaappealing to him to negotiate with de Klerk and implicitly chidingthe newly released leader for his endorsement of violence againstapartheid.   ``The whole world and all Africa is counting on you to workthrough dialogue toward a triumph for the noble cause of peace,equality and brotherhood,'' Boigny said.   He also praised de Klerk, who visited the Ivory Coast inDecember.   ``History will ... pay you homage for the personal part you haveplayed in the changes that give great hopes to all South Africanpeople for the building of a great and democratic nation,''Houphouet-Boigny said.   Other African countries welcomed Mandela's release, but joinedhis African National Congress in warning that much work lies ahead.   Nigeria's military government said Mandela's release is``positive proof that concerted pressure on the apartheid regime,including mandatory sanctions, continue to have the desiredeffect.''   Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe urged the world not to bedeceived into believing de Klerk has yet ``tackled the substantiveissues of apartheid.''   Mugabe, like the leaders of Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Liberia,said Mandela's release must be followed by freedom for allpolitical prisoners, the lifting of emergency regulations and therepeal of all racist laws.   A Liberian government statement said Pretoria's actionaccentuated the need for continued international pressure on SouthAfrica.   But it welcomed Mandela's release from an imprisonment it called``a violation of his fundamental human rights.''   Liberia itself is drawing increasing international criticism forhuman rights abuses that culminated in January with the allegedkillings of at least 500 civilians by troops fighting to put downan ethnic rebellion. The killings have caused some 144,000 refugeesto flee the country.   As the world celebrated Mandela's release Sunday, the WestAfrican state of Senegal, which boasts it is a democracy, quicklydetained opposition leader Abdoulaye Wade as he returned home froma six-month exile.   Wade claims his Senegalese Democratic Party won February 1988elections in which President Abdou Diouf claimed victory for hisSocialist Party.   Some Western countries accuse African governments of similarhypocrisy in their calls for sanctions against South Africa.</TEXT></DOC>
