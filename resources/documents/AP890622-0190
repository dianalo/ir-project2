James W. Glosser, administrator of the department's Animal andPlant Health Inspection Service, said the tests will be conducted inQueen Anne's County, Md. Last month the agency approved thecompany's plan to test the same genetically altered microorganism incorn.   A soil organism, Bacillus thuringiensis, contains a gene for aprotein that becomes toxic when eaten by caterpillars. This gene wasadded to a second bacterium, Clavibacter xyli (subspeciescynodontis), which can live within the rice plant.   By combining the two, scientists hope rice plants can havebuilt-in protection against insect pests.</TEXT></DOC>
