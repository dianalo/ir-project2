Sotheby's has long sought to build a tower of luxurycondominium apartments atop its Manhattan auctionheadquarters. Late Wednesday, it cleared a local hurdle inthe four-year-old effort.</LP><TEXT>   The subcommittee of a local community board, which hasbeen meeting on-and-off since 1986 with Sotheby's officials,voted to give the apartment project a green light. However,some area residents gathered at the meeting expressedopposition.   &quot;The community's concerns have less to do with thebuilding than with quality-of-life issues&quot; such as increasedlimousine traffic and construction noise, said Hedi H. White,chairman of Community Board Eight, an advisory group whichoversees development on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. ButSotheby's pledge to construct low-income housing, probably ona site on East 96th Street, was seen a benefit to thecommunity, she said.   The project, which will add 26 residential floors and ahealth club above Sotheby's headquarters at East 72nd Streetand York Avenue, was certified by the Department of CityPlanning Feb. 27. It still awaits approval by the fullcommittee of the community board, which meets Wednesday, andthen by the city's Board of Estimate.   Sotheby's already has a real-estate brokerage divisionwhich handles sales of luxury homes. A. Alfred Taubman, headof Taubman andamp; Co., one of the largest real-estate developmentfirms in the U.S., is the auction house's chairman.   Architect Michael Graves designed the tower, whichincludes 256 apartments. In addition, Sotheby's will add onefloor to its existing four-story auction facility, which willbe remodeled while auction operations continue. Mr. Graves isalso the designer of a controversial addition to the WhitneyMuseum of American Art in New York. His design for theSotheby's building -- full of details such as balconies thatjut out at angles and diagonal designs of glazed ornamentaltile -- is modeled in part after an Italian palazzo.   The building was originally scheduled to be finished in1989, but &quot;given the state of the New York real estatemarket,&quot; it probably was in Sotheby's interest that theproject has been delayed, said Michael Ainslie, Sotheby'spresident. Even after approval, &quot;we didn't say we're going tobuild,&quot; he added.   But Shelly S. Friedman, an attorney for Sotheby's, saidconstruction will probably begin late this year or in early1991.</TEXT></DOC>
