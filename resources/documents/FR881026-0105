The purchase agreement between Chelseaand PSO was conditioned on an affirmative vote of the qualified votersof Chelsea approving both the acceptance of PSO's bid and the grant toPSO of a 25-year franchise to operate it. On July 26, 1988 an electionwas held, both measures were approved, and the parties anticipated thatthe transaction would be closed on August 24, 1988. In the interim, anaction in the District Court of Rogers County, Oklahoma, successfully challengedthe election, whose results were set aside.As a consequence, another election must be held before the transactioncan be consummated. However, PSO's authorization granted in the InitialOrder to consummate the transaction has expired pursuant to Rule 24(c)(1).PSO therefore requests that it be authorized to purchase Chelsea's distributionsystem at any time through July 30, 1989, in order to allow sufficienttime for the new election to be held.<ITAG tagnum="84">Middle South Utilities, Inc., et al.

Borrowings under each Bank Note will have a maximum maturity ofnine months, will bear interest at a fixed or floating rate, and at suchrate as should be negotiated by the lending bank and the Companies issuingsuch Bank Note. In issuing Bank Notes, the Companies will negotiate thelowest effective interest cost for short-term borrowings, taking into accountthe proposed amount and maturity of each borrowing. Before reaching agreementwith lending banks as to the interest rate on borrowing, the Companieswill assess the then prevailing short-term rates, such as the prime rate,LIBOR, federal funds rates and certificate of deposit rates, but in noevent will the interest rate exceed the higher of 1% above the lender'sprime rate or 2% above the Federal Funds Rate. Based on an assumed primerate of 10.00% as of August 31, 1988, the effective cost of borrowingsunder the informal credit lines would be 10.00% or 10.5% under formal creditlines assuming a 5% compensating balance. Borrowings evidenced by the BankNotes will occur no later than December 31, 1990. Floating rate notes willgenerally be subject to prepayment at any time at the Companies' option.Fixed rate notes may, in certain circumstances, not be prepayable, or maybe prepayable only with ``Make whole'' payments. Companies other than Quinnehtukmay negotiate formal credit lines with one or more banks, subject to compensatingbalance requirements not exceeding 5% of available amounts, and fees notexceeding .25% per annum.NU, CLandamp;P and WMECO request authority to issue and sell Commercial Paperto dealers at the prevailing discount rate per annum on the date of issuancefor commercial paper of comparable quality and the particular maturitysold by other public utilities. Such sales will occur only if the issuerbelieves that the effective interest cost will be equal to or less thanthat cost for the issuance of Bank Notes in amounts at least equal to theprincipal amount of the Commercial Paper. The Companies proposed to continue the use of the Pool administered byNUSCO. The Pool is composed of available funds loaned by the participatingCompanies and borrowed by the participating Companies, except NU, to assistin meeting their respective short-term borrowing needs. Additionally, NUwould be able to borrow funds by issuing Bank Notes or selling CommercialPaper solely for the purpose of lending those funds through the Pool toNUSCO, NNECO, Quinnehtuk, and RRR. <ITAG tagnum="84">Georgia Power Company (70-7559)</ITAG>Georgia Power Company (``Georgia Power''), 333 Piedmont Avenue, NE., Atlanta,Georgia, a wholly owned electric utility subsidiary of The Southern Company,a registered holding company, has filed an application-declaration pursuantto Section 9(a), 10 and 12(d) of the Act and Rule 44 thereunder.Since 1963, Georgia Power has leased the distribution system serving theCity of Warwick, Georgia (``Warwick System'') under a lease agreement (``LeaseAgreement'') with Plant Telephone and Power Company (``Plant''), a nonaffiliatecompany.

For theremaining years, the Maximum Interest Rate will be LIBOR plus \3/8\ of1%. The Credit Facility further contemplates that, should NEHFC wish to issuecommercial paper in lieu of, or in conjunction with, its direct borrowingoptions the Bank Participants will provide ``back up'' for a letter ofcredit to support such commercial paper issuance. This commitment to backup a letter of credit would be available unconditionally for the initialthree years of the Credit Facility and extendable at the mutual optionof NEHFC and the Bank Participants on a year-by-year basis thereafter.However, NEHFC would first have to secure one or more letters of creditfrom the Bank Participants or other banks to provide for the direct paymentof maturing commercial paper.

The principal amount of Advances to NEHFC available under the Credit Facilitywill be reduced in equal semiannual amounts beginning January 1, 1994.If Phase II is cancelled, the Credit Facility shall be terminated 180 daysfrom the date of cancellation.
