Lawyers for the state said they will carry their fight to theOhio Supreme Court against the ruling that reversed convictions offormer Home State owner Marvin Warnerr, a millionaire and former U.S. ambassadorto Switzerland,and Schiebel were convicted by a Hamilton County Common Pleas Courtjury on charges resulting from the Cincinnati-based thrift'scollapse in March 1985.   Both Warner and Schiebel have been free on bond while appealingtheir March 1987 convictions. Warner, 70, had been sentenced to 3{years in prison. Schiebel, 58, was sentenced to six months.   Warner said Wednesday from his Ocala, Fla., horse farm that hisreputation is still at stake.   ``I feel sort of like Ray Donovan. Donovan was found not guiltyand he asked, `Which office do I go to to get my reputation back?'That's about the situation I'm in,'' he said, referring to formerReagan administration labor secretary who was cleared by a New Yorkjury in May 1987 of fraud and larceny charges.   Schiebel said, ``I always knew I'd be vindicated.''   A three-judge panel of the 1st Ohio District Court of Appealsreversed the convictions on three securities counts charging thetwo men covered up Home State's precarious finances in circularsdistributed to raise money for Home State in 1984. That portion ofthe case was sent back to the lower court for a possible new trial.   Home State's collapse caused a crisis for 69 other privatelyinsured Ohio savings and loans institutions whose deposits wereinsured by the Ohio Deposit Guarantee Fund.   The appeals court upheld defense arguments challenging theseating of trial juror Beth Statt, who had an account at anotherbank insured by the Ohio Deposit Guarantee Fund.   The appeals court also dimissed Warner's conviction on sixcounts that he oversaw unauthorized transfers of Home State moneyto a trading partner, ESM Government Securities Inc. of FortLauderdale, Fla. The court said the state did not presentsufficient evidence.   R. Stan Mortenson, a lawyer for Warner, said Warner cannot beretried on those counts.   Home State collapsed four days after ESM was declared insolvent.The thrift lost $144 million through its securities transactionswith ESM.   The appellate court also threw out the lower court's order thatWarner pay $22 million in restitution to Ohio and $250,000 inprosecution costs, and that Schiebel pay $25,000 in prosecutioncosts.   The court said the cost and restitution penalties were based ona statement of fees submitted by the state that had not beencertified as correct and legal.   Lawrence A. Kane Jr., Ohio's special prosecutor who obtained theconvictions, said the state will appeal.   ``The court's decision is based on technical, procedural issues,not the merits of the guilt or innocence of the defendants,'' Kanesaid.   Before it collapsed, Home State had about $1.4 billion in assetsand served about 92,000 depositors in the Cincinnati, Columbus andDayton areas.   The savings bank was sold and reopened in June 1985. Gov.Richard Celeste temporarily closed the other thrifts and orderedthem to obtain federal deposit insurance or merge with companiesthat had it before reopening.</TEXT></DOC>
