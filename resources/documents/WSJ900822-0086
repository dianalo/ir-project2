The goal of the U.S. and itssupporting forces in the Persian Gulf should be just that --to win. Settling for a lesser goal is a recipe forcatastrophe on the ground and political recrimination later.Vietnam took years to teach us that truth.   Military doctrine has always been to deploy forcedecisively. According to a World War II military adage onkeeping casualties down, if you need a squad for a mission,then send in a battalion, and if you need a battalion, sendin a division. In Vietnam, we found that bombing Hanoi wasthe only way we could make progress even in negotiations. Inthe pre-nuclear age, any military man would have seen theanswer in Vietnam as a massive invasion of the north. Wedidn't invade because of the danger of superpowerintervention; MacArthur had done it in North Korea, but theChinese intervened. &quot;Superpower,&quot; of course, has been acodeword in the postwar period for massive nuclearcapability.</LP><TEXT>   Now, however, Iraq has no superpower protector. WithMoscow subtracted from Saddam's calculations, his network ofsupport has shriveled. Even Libya's Gadhafi has just calledin reporters to issue a condemnation of Iraq'shostage-taking, which suggests that these nasty folks areincreasingly being left on their own.   Iraq does not have the reserves for a long war; many ofthe reserves it does possess have already been absorbed intothe army. The fact that Saddam has somewhat artificiallypumped up his army's strength in this manner may account forthe growing doubts about Iraqi military morale; two pilotshave defected, and there have been reports, though difficultto confirm, of defections by some tank commanders.   The point of thinking seriously about Iraq's military andpolitical position is not that it will tell us whether we canmove against Saddam's army. The more relevant calculation iswhen and how we will do so. (Though we would also have totake some precautions against an Iranian invasion of Kuwait.)   Using our amassed force decisively is not only the propermilitary way, but once the necessity of force has been madeclear, it becomes the moral way. It will get the war over andkeep down casualties.   It is of course necessary to consider the troubling factorthat has become a given of politics in the Middle East:hostages. Up to this point, the Middle East terrorists'willingness to seize and sacrifice the innocent has greatlycircumscribed the West's ability to respond. Now, however, wehave the spectacle of Saddam Hussein moving civilians topositions around his military installations as a &quot;humanshield&quot; against attack.   Two important points need to be made about this ultimateescalation of the hostage strategy. Saddam's threat is thefinal evidence that he is nothing more than an internationalthug who needs to be removed if there is to be any peace inthe Middle East now or in the foreseeable future. Negotiatingwith him, which many in the West surely would support, wouldleave his military machine intact. That would leave the Gulfat his mercy and the world at the mercy of any future piratewho can lay hands on some Americans.   Indeed, our second point is that the foreigners now atrisk in Kuwait are already victims of the Americanpreoccupation with hostages in Iran and Lebanon. Theterrorists long ago learned the lesson that with hostages inhand, the U.S. political culture will reflexively standstrategy on its head by making any judgments about militaryengagement subordinate to the hostage issue. Thus in 1984 theU.S. sent to Beirut a military force one-tenth of whatPresident Eisenhower dispatched to Lebanon in 1958. TheEisenhower intervention (9,000 troops, 70 warships, 400planes) got its job done cleanly; the Beirut fiasco stilllives in public memory.   Times have changed. Within the space of several weeks,whatever illusions remained about the nature of MiddleEastern politics have fallen away. President Bush hasassembled a large U.S. military force in the Persian Gulf,and it has been joined by supporting forces from theinternational community. Saddam Hussein will likely continueto play the hostage card, the one ploy that has worked forhis kind in the recent past.   Accordingly, the formula now ought to be that we will giveevery consideration for the hostages, and for that matterother noncombatants, consistent with achieving our militaryand political purposes.</TEXT></DOC>
