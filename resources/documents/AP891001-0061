Nearly 5,000 booths nationwide were opened to register theestimated 1.9 million voters.   President Daniel Ortega was the first in line at the boothserving his area, an upper-class neighborhood in central Managua.Dressed in his military uniform, Ortega arrived with his wife,Rosario Murillo, and several of their children.   Speaking to reporters, Ortega called on all Nicaraguans toregister ``so there will be massive participation'' in theballoting Feb. 25 for president, vice president, a new legislatureand mayors.   Ortega advanced the date of 1991 elections as part of a peaceaccord he and four other Central American presidents signed inAugust. He pledged opposition candidates could campaign withoutharassment and with a free press, and that the balloting would befair.   As part of the pact, the five presidents agreed to disband theU.S.-supported rebels, known as Contras, by Dec. 8. Most of theContras are based across the border in Honduras.   In a news release the Defense Ministry said a group of rebelsattacked a military patrol about 110 miles north of ManaguaSaturday. The release, issued Sunday, said one soldier and twoContras were killed in the gunbattle.   Ortega and Vice President Sergio Ramirez are seeking re-electionon the ticket of the ruling leftist Sandinista National LiberationFront. Both were elected in 1984.   There were some irregularities at Ortega's booth Sunday: Itopened an hour late at 8 a.m., the representative of the NationalOpposition Union coalition on the board did not show up and hisdeputy arrived without any identification. The deputy was sent hometo get it but hours later had not returned.   Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, presidential candidate of theopposition alliance and publisher of the newsaper La Prensa,registered at a booth in her neighborhood after attending Mass.   Joao Baena Soares, general secretary of the Organization ofAmerican States, a team from the United Nations and four U.S.congressmen were among the foreigners observing the registrationprocess.   ``I see that people are motivated, and that there's a greatinterest in registering,'' Baena told reporters after visiting 11registration booths in Leon, 56 miles northwest of Managua andNicaragua's second largest city.   Rep. David Drier, R-Calif., Howard Coble, R-N.C., Cass Balenger,R-N.C., and Porter Goss, R-Fla., were among those visiting thebooths.   Heavy rain in most of the country made many roads muddy, makingaccess to the booths difficult in rural areas.   In the 1984 elections, Ortega showed up to register without anyidentification. To everyone's amusement, he had to ask two peopleto certify his identity.   The United States supports the opposition and backs Nicaraguanrebels trying to overthrow the leftist government.</TEXT></DOC>
