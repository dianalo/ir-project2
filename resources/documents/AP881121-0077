Also at the trial, a defense attorney said confessed hijackerMohammed Ali Hamadi was ``mentally disturbed'' during the crime andasked that his client be given a psychiatric examination.   Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, is accused of air piracy andmurder in the June 1985 hijacking. U.S. Navy diver Robert Stethemwas killed and 39 Americans were held hostage for 17 days.   Vincente Garza, a real estate developer, testified that hisson-in-law, Robert Trautmann, was among several hostages taken offthe plane at Beirut Airport and then hidden in the city before theordeal was over.   Garza, 57, said he offered to take Trautmann's place.   ``I thought he could be ... shot, and I asked Hamadi `don't takehim away, take me.' Hamadi just pushed me back and told me to sitdown,'' Garza testified, choking back his emotions and seeming onthe verge of crying.   Garza said Hamadi also took part in robbing passengers.   Earlier today, defense attorney Hans-Burkhardt Steck asked that apsychiatrist examine Hamadi. He said he has evidence from apsychiatrist that Hamadi had been ``hindered in his development''because of injuries he sustained in war-torn Beirut.   Another American testified that she feared the hijackers woulddeal with her severely because she was Jewish.   ``I was very afraid because I am Jewish and I didn't know if theyknew it,'' Mauri Schwarz, a 36-year-old computer saleswoman, toldthe court. ``I heard screams and beatings on more than oneoccasion.''   Ms. Schwarz said one of the passengers sitting near her had askedfor medical help because he had a heart condition ``but thehijackers refused.''   Following Ms. Schwarz' testimony, Hamadi was asked to comment.   ``I never took part in the robberies and if anyone had asked mefor a doctor, I would have done that,'' he said.   Under court guidelines to protect witnesses, former hostages donot reveal their hometowns.   They have testified about savage beatings and the death ofStethem, who was shot and thrown out onto the tarmac in Beirut.   Hamadi admits being one of the hijackers, but denies shootingStethem.   He was arrested at Frankfurt Airport in January 1987 after customofficials found liquid explosives in his luggage.   The United States requested Hamadi's extradition last year, butthe West German government turned it down, fearing for the lives oftwo West Germans held hostage in Lebanon. The hostages since havebeen released.   Hamadi's older brother, Abbas, is serving a 13-year prison termin West Germany in connection with the kidnappings.  </TEXT></DOC>
