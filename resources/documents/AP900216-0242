But bondholders who financed Campeau Corp.'s takeovers of thetwo retailing companies will have to forgive some of the $7.7billion debt listed in the bankruptcy petition filed Jan. 15 byFederated and Allied, they said.   ``It is clear that some of that (debt) will not bedecapitalized,'' G. William Miller, chairman of parent companyFederated Stores Inc., said Thursday. ``Some of it will have todisappear, permanently.   ``For those who hold the debt, the market is no longer there ...We want them to get a reasonable recovery.''   Miller, Federated-Allied Chairman Allen Questrom, and PresidentJames Zimmerman read prepared statements Thursday to reporters andrepresentatives of Federated-Allied's largest creditors.   They built on the theme that Federated and Allied, which operate260 stores in 28 states, are close to returning to business asusual and expect to be profitable.   They also acknowledged that mistakes were made in financing theacquisition of Allied in 1986 and Federated in 1988 byToronto-based Campeau, and in operating the stores the past twoyears.   Zimmerman said that by September 1989, it was evident thatFederated and Allied could not meet their debt payments and thatmajor financial restructuring was necessary.   But he said the decision to file for protection from creditorsunder Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Act wasn't made until January,and then primarily to prevent further erosion in the value of thebusinesses.   ``There was no plot to deceive any creditors,'' Zimmerman said.``There was no grand scheme in Toronto or elsewhere to trickanybody.''   ``These are quality companies ... companies of this caliber donot belong in Chapter 11,'' he said. ``We regret that any of ourcreditors were left holding the bag with checks that did not clearprior to our filing.   Questrom was vice chairman of Federated Department Stores whenit was acquired by Campeau. He said he left because of reservations_ ``as have been so tragically confirmed since'' _ about the parentcompany's ability to handle the debt it had assumed.   He subsequently became president of Nieman-Marcus, but returnedearlier this month _ for a guaranteed $10 million _ to find acompany ``that deserved better than what it was getting, betterthan what had been inherited in the wake of two massive retailtakeovers, inordinate organizational changes and months ofdebilitating uncertainty,'' he said.   Miller, a former U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, said he assumedleadership last month of the parent company, Campeau (U.S.), oncondition that it be renamed and assured autonomy, distancingitself from Robert Campeau, the Canadian real estate developer whoengineered the junk bond-financed takeovers of Allied and Federated.   Although creditors were invited to hear the presentations by theFederated-Allied officers, no questions were permitted by the U.S.Trustee who conducted the meeting. At a news conference followingthe meeting, officers refused to discuss specifics aboutreorganization.   Zimmerman acknowledged that some stores will be closed, perhaps``a handful of stores across the country,'' but said he expects noacross-the-board layoffs.   Miller said it was premature to sketch a reorganization planpublicly.   ``I would prefer to bring out a comprehensive plan where I canmake sure all the pieces fit and all the wheels mesh and that itturns smoothly rather than feed out ideas before they have beenresearched, before they have been discussed with the other side,''Miller said.   Miller said Federated-Allied still have three months to filetheir plan with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court.   The Federated group includes Bloomingdale's (17 stores) andAbraham and Straus (15), both based in New York; Burdine's (30) ofMiami; Lazarus (44) of Cincinnati; and Rich's (26) of Atlanta.   The Allied group includes The Bon Marche (40 stores) of Seattle;Jordan Marsh (26) of Boston; Maas Brothers (38) of Tampa; andStern's (24) of Paramus, N.J.</TEXT></DOC>
