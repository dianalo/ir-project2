The attorneys are joining Arnold andamp; Porter, which, with more than 300 lawyers, is the largest firm in the capital.    The loss of the 11 lawyers, including two partners, reduces the size of Hughes Hubbard's Washington office by 40%. It comes on the heels of other important departures, most notably that of Philip Lacovara, who became senior litigation counsel for General Electric Co. last April. In September, Peter Kreindler, a well-known antitrust lawyer, left the office to join the in-house legal department of Coopers andamp; Lybrand.    As managing partner of Hughes Hubbard's Washington office, Mr. Lacovara kept the focus on litigation. All 25 lawyers in the office are litigators. Mr. Lacovara is still affiliated with the law firm in a part-time capacity.    Mr. Lacovara and other Hughes Hubbard lawyers in Washington have been involved in two major cases recently. The firm is defending the joint operating agreement between its client, Knight-Ridder Inc.'s Detroit Free Press, and Gannett Co.'s Detroit News. Hughes Hubbard also represents Houston-based Texas Air Corp., which has been embroiled in a bitter battle with its labor unions.    Otis Pearsall, a senior partner in New York, said Hughes Hubbard's work on these cases wouldn't be affected by the defections. &quot;It won't have much effect at all,&quot; he said. &quot;We have a strong office remaining.&quot; Mr. Pearsall also said there were plans to rebuild and diversify the office beyond litigation.    Arnold andamp; Porter expressed delight at its acquisitions. John D. Hawke Jr., chairman of Arnold andamp; Porter's policy committee, said the new lawyers from Hughes Hubbard &quot;add tremendous distinction to an already strong litigation group of more than 100 attorneys.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
