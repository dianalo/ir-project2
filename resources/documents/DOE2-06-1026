Mostof the mires are concentric raised bogs of the Satakunta-type with ratherhigh peat hummocks often with an aboundance of lichens, water pools andbare-peat hollows are frequent. According to this investigation the mostcommon site type is pine mires (76%). There are 19% of treeless mires,3% of hardwood-spruce mires and 2% old peat land forests. Sixtyeightper cent of the peat is Sphangnum predominant, and 32% Carex predominant.The mires studied contain a total of 37.1 million m''3 of peat. The meandepth of the mires is 2.4 m including the slightly humitied surface layer,which averages 0.9 m in ticckness. The mean humification degree (H) ofthe peat is 5.1 (v. Post's scale). As much as 81% of the total peat or30.7 million m''3, is at a depht of over 2 m in an area covering 885ha. The average asidity (pH) of the peat is 3.9, the average ash contentis 1.5% of dry weight, the water content 92.2% of weight and the drydensity 79 kg per m''3. The effective caloric value of the dry peat is20.4 MJ/kg. The sulphure content is o.21% of dry weight. The total areaof six peatlands suitable for fuel peat production is 357 hectares, inaverage 2.4 meters deep and the available amount of peat is 8. 70 millioncubic meters. The energy content of fuel peat at 50% moinsture is 12.7mill. GJ or 3.5 mill MWh. Horticultural peat is to be found in threepeat bogs at 76 hectares with an average thickness of 1.3 m. The availableamount of horticultural peat is 1 mill. m''3. The Sphagnum peat sampleshas an asidity of 3.6 and the ash content is 1.0% of dry weight. Kahilakeidas,a typical concentric raised bog of which 149 ha are in natural conditions,is included in the National Mire Preservation Programme.</TEXT></DOC>
