Alfred Herrhausen was chairman of Deutsche Bank, West Germany'slargest, and one of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's chief economicadvisers.   Police said the the bicycle-bomb apparently was placed on astreet of this spa town outside Frankfurt, where the 59-year-oldbanker lived, and detonated by a sophisticated light-beam device ashe drove by on his way to work.   They said it was the first time terrorists used such a detonatorin West German.   Federal criminal police offered a reward of up to $2.2 million,one of the largest here ever.   Police with helicopters were searching for two men seen leavingthe area. A stolen white Lancia believed to have been used in thegetaway was found abandoned in a Frankfurt suburb.   ``For a long time, the Deutsche Bank and Herrhausen inparticular have been targeted by the Red Army Faction,'' saidHans-Juergen Foerster, spokesman for the chief federal prosecutor'soffice. He said the ultraleftists accuse Deutsche Bank of financinga worldwide ``military-industrial'' complex.   The explosion, heard three miles away, turned Herrhausen'sarmored limousine into a heap of twisted metal and blew out windowsin buildings.   His driver, Jakob Nix, was seriously injured, but police saidhis condition was not critical. Security agents following inanother car were unhurt.   A letter found at the scene claimed responsibility on behalf ofthe Red Army Faction, West Germany's deadliest terrorist group, ofwhich little had been heard since 1986.   Foerster said the letter ``was not typical'' of Red Army Factionclaims because it did not explain motives. After previous attacks,the terrorist group left lengthy statements giving detailed reasonsfor the actions.   He said the letter was signed ``Commando Wolfgang Beer,'' for asuspect in an investigation of the Red Army Faction, and carriedFaction symbols: a star-shaped symbol and a drawing of aKalashnikov assault rifle.   Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, who is in charge of policeand security issues, said protection for prominent figures wasstepped up after a Red Army Faction hunger strike that ended lastApril.   During the fast, one imprisoned terrorist called for increasingactivities ``with all means.''   Schaeuble told ZDF TV that since then, Red Army Factionfollowers are believed operating with more autonomy than before,when they were guided by a tight-knit structure.   Chancellor Kohl, his eyes filled with tears and his voicebreaking, condemned the ``cowardly and brutal murder'' of hispersonal friend.   Parliament interrupted debate for five minutes in honor ofHerrhausen.   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwilersaid, ``We deplore this terrorist act ... and stand ready to assistin any way that we can.''   Herrhausen, the best-known figure in West German business, oftenadvised Kohl and frequently accompanied him on trips abroad. Thetall, striking financier had led Deutsche Bank on an aggressiveexpansion aimed at putting it among the world's top 10 or 15 banks.   He urged more investment in the Soviet Union and other parts ofEastern Europe. Most recently, he recommended West Germaninvestment in East Germany.   Deutsche Bank owns large interests in many leading West Germancompanies, including Daimler-Benz, the largest conglomerate.Herrhausen arranged the biggest industrial restructuring in WestGerman history, the merger of Daimler-Benz with aerospace giantMesserschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm.   The bank under Herrhausen had been preparing for a leading roleas the Common Market moves toward a barrier-free internal market of1992.   The bank's efforts to gain a stake in investment bankingculminated this week in the $640 million takeover bid for theBritish investment bank Morgan Grenfell Group PLC.   The banker sat on many company boards, and last year became thesole chairman of Deutsche Bank, which he joined in 1969.   The Red Army Faction was born in the 1960s and has a longhistory of attacks on West German business and political figures,as well as U.S. military targets.   Its last known operations were the murders in 1986 of Karl HeinzBeckurts of the giant Siemens industrial concern and diplomatGerold von Braunmuehl. The Red Army faction was believed connectedwith an unsuccessful attempt on the life of Finance Ministryofficial Hans Tietmeyer in September 1988.   Heinrich Boge, head of the federal criminal investigation'soffice, said: ``There were never any signs that they had given up,so we were constantly warning against people writing them off tooquickly.''   The Red Army faction is believed to have 20 to 30 hard-coremembers, aided by dozens of sympathizers. Most of its originalleaders have been killed by police, committed suicide in prison orare serving long prison sentences.   Herrhausen's wife and two daughters survive.</TEXT></DOC>
