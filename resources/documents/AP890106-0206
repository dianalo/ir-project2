It is pervasive.   It has been going on for years now, and headline writers havejust finished packaging it for still another year. You've seen thetype: ``Economists relieved by 1988, worry about slump in 1989.''   Those fears have accompanied six years of uninterrupted expansionduring which more people have been put to work than ever in Americanhistory, more profits made, more dividends paid. Inflation has beenrestrained throughout.   No matter. There are big budget deficits, trade deficits, badloans, shaky financial institutions, high but apparently stillinsufficient taxes, rising interest rates, threats of trade wars andmore to deny anyone a sense of ease.   As a result, optimistic economic forecasters dare not rely ontheir data but instead issue forecasts with asterisks of protectivequalification. To them, the White House is always overly optimistic;it's a rule of the game.   On Wall Street, bullish brokers tell clients to be fullyinvested, and then issue cigarette-package caveats. And in industry,in automobiles, for instance, they lay plans for a big year butworry about high interest rates.   Individuals worry about the possibility of higher utility bills,higher interest rates on their variable mortgages, higher taxes(only 20 percent of that credit card interest is deductible thisyear _ half last year's rate).   For the most part, these nervous imprints on the brain are thevery ones everyone had a year ago and the year before that.Indelibly impressed, they are now set for another year of carryingtensions and fears, realistic or not.   In contrast, however, there are some very good reasons forAmericans to accept some satisfication and relief.   The economy, for instance, is stronger at the beginning of 1989than almost anyone could have forecast one year ago and retainedrespectability. The worst did not happen in 1988; the economyimproved rather than deteriorated.   In spite of all the psychological hangups, growth reached morethan 3.5 percent and the expansion reached a peacetime record ofmore than six years. Moreover, that growth was in business capitalinvestment and exports, sectors that the country needed toencourage. And it came without major complications.   The stock market didn't crash again, as feared, and now it looksa lot stronger than a year ago. Corporate profits rose sharply, andso price-earnings multiples shrank to just a little more thanone-half their precrash peaks.   The foreign-debt crisis that threatened the stability of thenation's largest banks is now far less a problem. With some strongprofits, banks have raised reserves against losses. Suspendedinterest payments have resumed.   While far from being corrected, the merchandise trade deficit hasbeen improving. And it cannot be assumed, in spite of fears, thatthe seemingly insurmountable federal budget deficit won't becontrolled in a few years.   Even the possibility of higher interest rates doesn't generatequite the fear it might have a year ago. There is a greaterawareness of the dangers of personal debt; people seem to be a bitmore saving and conservative.   Nobody expects very big things from the economy this year, andthey didn't last year either. And, in fact, ``big'' things didn'thappen _ merely a steady accumulation of good little things and anabsence of disasters.   That angst, everything considered, might be the steadiestgovernor the economy can have.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Mon., Jan. 9.</NOTE></DOC>
