In fact, I did, in the novel&quot;Voyagers II: The Aliens Within,&quot; published in 1986. It is ascience fiction novel, of course.</LP><TEXT>   It has always surprised me that people who pay attentionto stock market analysts and weather forecasters refuse toread science fiction. They are missing the best techniqueavailable for examining the future.   There is virtually nothing that has been discovered orinvented in this century that was not predicted in a sciencefiction story. From computers to space travel, from organtransplants to genetic engineering, robots, nuclear power,the population explosion, the energy crunch, urban sprawl andgreenhouse warming -- all were subjects of science fictionstories 20, 40, 60 years ago and more.   I am speaking of science fiction as it is published inbooks and magazines, not the &quot;sci-fi&quot; of Hollywood. Most&quot;sci-fi&quot; movies bear the same relationship to science fictionthat Popeye does to naval history. Even films based on solidscience fiction, such as the Schwarzenegger epic &quot;TotalRecall,&quot; bury the science fiction ideas beneath an orgy ofmindless violence. Would you give the cops machine guns ifyou lived in a glass dome? Come on]   (Incidentally, the term &quot;sci-fi&quot; is loathed by mostscience fiction writers. It is a term of derision, usedmainly by publicity agents and desperate headline writers.)   Futurists, the professional scientists who make a careerof technological and/or sociological forecasting, are likescience fiction writers who have had the imagination beatenout of them. If you have ever read a futurist's report fiveyears after it was published you know that their forecastsare usually worthless. This is because they must labor undera tremendous handicap: They must stick to the facts that areknown at the time the report is written. This means theirforecasts tend to be straight-line extrapolations of thepresent situation that become more and more inaccurate thefarther into the future we go.   Science fiction writers, on the other hand, are nothampered by the limitations of the present. They can createcrazy ideas, wild cards. They are free to invent anythingthey can imagine, as long as it does not violate the basiclaws of science. (And, in some cases, even if it does.) Ifyou wait long enough, the wild card eventually shows up. TheArabs do put an embargo on petroleum. The Soviet system doescrack apart. Ray guns become lasers. Invisible airplanesbecome Stealth bombers.   Does this mean that you can foretell the future by readingscience fiction? Yes. And no.   Science fiction writers are really not even trying topredict the future. Most of us do not believe there is asingle, immutable THE future to predict. The future isplastic, unformed, capable of being shaped by all the thingseach of us does -- and all the things we fail to do.   Science fiction stories examine possible futures. Thewriter takes a set of ideas and asks, &quot;What would happen if .. .&quot; And the game begins. What would happen if a flyingsaucer landed on the White House lawn and gave us an energysource that ran on water and produced no harmful pollution?In science fiction, that is the beginning of a story. Howwould the world change? Who would benefit? Who would gethurt? Where should you invest your money?   By reading science fiction, you get a kaleidoscopic viewof many possible futures. The one that actually happens is inthere someplace. It may become reality because enough readersliked that future well enough to make it come true. Most ofthe men who walked on the moon started by reading sciencefiction. So did most of the people who got them there.   This is not to say that every tale is a literary gem. Farfrom it. The late science fiction writer Theodore Sturgeonyears ago coined Sturgeon's Law: Ninety percent of sciencefiction is crud; but then, 90% of everything is crud.   At its best, science fiction acts as a sort of simulationslaboratory in which we test ideas about the future. &quot;Whatif?&quot; is the question constantly being examined.   What if Saddam Hussein succeeds in his quest to developnuclear arms for Iraq? What if AIDS or a similarimmune-system disease spreads to the general population? Whatif the greenhouse effect melts the polar ice caps?   Can a world divided into nations and blocs create aneffective International Peacekeeping Force with the power andauthority to prevent any nation from attacking any othernation?   Will electronic books replace paper?   Will private enterprise finally move into spacedevelopment and create the industries in orbit thatgovernment programs cannot? Or will space be left entirely topolitically motivated government efforts?   Will advances in biotechnology allow us to live forcenturies? Or become virtually immortal?   These are the kinds of questions that good science fictionconsiders. Surely, if any field of literature can be said tohave any practical value, this ongoing examination of thefuture's many pathways is as important as it is entertaining.   ---   Mr. Bova, the author of more than 75 futuristic books,fiction and nonfiction, is president of the Science FictionWriters of America and former editorial director of Omnimagazine.</TEXT></DOC>
