(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Voodoo murder is usually the stuff ofpaperback novels and B-grade movies, but it's shaping up as thefare of a real-life court battle for two men accused of trying touse a hex to kill a judge.   ``They are ridiculous charges,'' insists John Henry Adams,charged along with his half-brother, Leroy Ivy, with conspiracy tocommit murder.   Prosecutors arrested Ivy on Oct. 14, 1988, minutes after he paid$100 for a faded photograph of Circuit Judge Thomas Gardner III.   Gardner had sentenced Adams, 25, to 40 years in the MississippiState Penitentiary on an armed robbery charge, a sentence thatAdams was serving at the time of the alleged plot.   Authorities claim the brothers intended to send the picture andwhat was supposed to be a lock of Gardner's hair _ both purchasedfrom undercover agents _ to a Jamaican voodoo priest who would casta death curse on the judge.   The brothers, who have the same mother but different fathers,have been jailed in Tupelo awaiting trial on the charges, unable topost $50,000 bonds. If convicted, they could face sentences of upto 20 years in prison and fines of up to $500,000 each.   Their trial, originally scheduled to begin Friday, has beendelayed because it was assigned to Gardner. A new judge is to beappointed. In the meantime, Adams and Ivy, who spoke duringseparate prison interviews, said they are growing weary of the waitand sick of the attention their case has drawn.   ``I'm tired of this. I want to know what's going on,'' said the33-year-old Ivy. ``They've already ruined my life with all theseallegations.''   ``What makes this so interesting?'' asked Adams, his lanky bodythrown into a molded plastic chair in a jail corridor.   Prosecutors will say little about the case.   ``I can't comment on the evidence or our trial plans,'' saidAssistant District Attorney Rowland Geddie Jr. Prosecutors areexpected, however, to argue that it makes no difference if theintended murder weapon was supernatural so long as the brothersintended to kill Gardner.   The defense is expected to argue that the judge's life was neverin danger.   At the center of the case is the brothers' alleged belief invoodoo, which Ivy flatly denies and Adams will not directly discuss.   ``Voodoo is a religion and I shouldn't comment on other people'sbeliefs,'' Adams said. ``A lot of people have made a joke out ofthis. You shouldn't make a joke out of something you don't knowanything about.''   The brothers say they haven't seen each other while they've beenin the Lee County Jail.   ``I ain't seen my brother in eight months. He's right downthere,'' Ivy said, gesturing toward one of two wings. I sure wouldlike to go down there and holler at him. But I know that would bewrong and I'm not fixing to do nothing wrong.''   He did not, he insists, do anything wrong when he purchased thepicture of Gardner from one of the judge's employees. Adams takesthe same position.   ``Nobody can say that I told anybody that I was going to murderanybody,'' Adams said. ``Nobody can say that I told anybody that Iwas going to practice voodoo. Where did that idea come from?''   What, then, did Adams intend to do with the photo?   ``If I told you, who would believe me?'' he replied.   Pressed on the subject, he finally said he planned to put thepicture on a punching bag he used for boxing at the prison. ``Thatwas all I could do with it,'' he said.   Ivy said he and his brother are being railroaded because theyare black.   ``I live in the South and these white folks don't allow no blackman to do nothing,'' he said. ``The justice system is not set upfor a black man. If a black man goes to court, nine times out of 10he's going to be found guilty.'' Adams said he is eager to go totrial.   ``I'm glad this case is going to trial,'' he said. ``Maybe thepublic will get a chance to see how the justice system is reallyrun in Lee County.''</TEXT></DOC>
