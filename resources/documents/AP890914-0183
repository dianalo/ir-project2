The request by IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus will likelybe the main topic of discussion when finance officials from 151nations gather in Washington later this month for the annualmeetings of the IMF and its sister organization, the World Bank.   The IMF is owned by the 151 countries with the largest share,$23.6 billion, coming from the United States. The U.S. share is outof total IMF resources of $118 billion.   The IMF resources, called quotas, are provided by membercountries, which pledge to keep a certain level of their financialreserves with the IMF.   In making his request, Camdessus said that 19 of the 22 membersof the IMF board had indicated that they supported an increase of atleast 66 percent, but he said a boost in resources of at least 80percent was needed to keep the IMF from being forced to ``limit theaccess of member countries to our help.''   The IMF and the World Bank have been key players in the Bushadministration's new debt reduction strategy unveiled by TreasurySecretary Nicholas Brady on March 10.   The Brady plan seeks to reduce the $1.3 trillion Third World debtburden by getting commercial banks to voluntarily write off aportion of the debt in exchange from guarantees from the two lendingagencies that a portion of the reduced debt will be repaid.   In another development Wednesday, John Reed, chairman ofCiticorp, the country's largest bank, said that he was concernedthat the Brady debt plan was being viewed solely as an effort reducedebt at the exclusion of new loans from commercial banks.   ``Our purpose, after all, is to restore economic and financialhealth to these economies _ which are important markets for theUnited States _ not to cut them off totally from the bankingsystem,'' Reed said at a news conference in Washington.   Some countries have already endorsed a doubling of IMF resources,but some U.S. officials have said they are not yet convinced thatany increase is needed.   In recent years the fund's money has gone for new loans to ThirdWorld countries, many of them heavily in debt, in return for pledgesof policy changes to put them in better financial condition.   Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., said on Wednesday that Congress wouldlikely give a cool reception to any request from the presidentunless the administration agreed to boost government resources byraising raxes.   Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, said that while Congress would initiallybe reluctant, it would eventually go along with the administration.   Critics of the IMF have been questioning the value of its efforts.   Jeffrey D. Sachs, professor of international trade at HarvardUniversity, said that the IMF has a record of failure in debtorcountries.   He said that of 39 or so countries that have been wrestling withdebt problems, few have been able to meet their obligations withoutundermining their national prosperity.   The World Bank announced, meanwhile, that Afghanistan hasrestored itself to good standing with a payment of $755,000.   It was made ineligible for new loans in June because it wasoverdue on about $26 million worth of debt. Afghanistan owes thebank about $79 million on 20 low-interest loans amounting to $230million that it received in past years.</TEXT></DOC>
