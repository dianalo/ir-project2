A new <T3>Example </T3>(23) is added to andSection; 1.861-8(g) by these regulationsto reflect this change. Specifically, new <T3>Example </T3>(23) illustrates how a related supplier's general andadministrative expenses are apportioned to its various classes of grossincome if the related supplier pays commissions to the FSC on export sales.In contrast to the apportionment of general and administrative expensesin existing <T3>Example </T3>(22) of andSection; 1.861-8(g) which involves an exportsale made through a DISC, new <T3>Example </T3>(23) illustrates that there is not a second stage apportionmentto FSC dividends attributable to the FSC's foreign trade income (exceptto the extent that the foreign trade income is determined under the section925(a)(3) transfer pricing method) of the related supplier's general andadministrative expenses that have already been apportioned to the combinedtaxable income of the FSC and the related supplier. The example also illustratesthat the related supplier's research and development expenses are apportionedin a like manner.In addition, new <T3>Example </T3>(23) of andSection; 1.861-8(g) illustrates that in the DISCcontext, there will not be a second stage apportionment to DISC dividendsof the related supplier's expenses that have already been apportioned tothe combined taxable income of the DISC and the related supplier. Existing<T3>Example </T3>(22) of andSection; 1.861(g) applies only with regard totaxable years beginning before January 1, 1987.New <T3>Example </T3>(23) does not apply to corporations electing the applicationof section 936.<ITAG tagnum="84">Drafting Information</ITAG>The principal author of these regulations is Richard Chewning of the Officeof Associate Chief Counsel (International), within the Office of ChiefCounsel, Internal Revenue Service. However, personnel from other officesof the Internal Revenue Service and Treasury Department participated indeveloping these regulations, both on matters of substance and style.<ITAG tagnum="84">Comments and Requests for a Public Hearing</ITAG>Before adopting as final regulations these proposed regulations, considerationwill be given to any written comments that are submitted (preferably eightcopies) to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. All comments will be availablefor public inspection and copying. A public hearing will be held upon writtenrequest to the Commissioner by any person who has submitted written comments.If a public hearing is to be held, notice of the time and place will bepublished in the <T4>Federal Register.</T4><ITAG tagnum="84">Special Analyses</ITAG>Although this document is a notice of proposed rulemaking which solicitspublic comment, it has been concluded that the proposed regulations areinterpretative and that the notice and public comment procedural requirementsof 5 U.S.C. 553 do not apply. Accordingly, these proposed regulations donot constitute regulations subject to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5U.S.C. Chapter 6). It has been determined that this proposed rule is nota major legislative regulation subject to Executive Order 12291. Accordingly,a Regulatory Impact Analysis is not required.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 26 CFR 1.861-1 through 1.997-1</ITAG>Income taxes, Aliens, Exports, DISC, Foreign investment in U.S., Foreigntax credit, FSC, Sources of income, United States investments abroad.Proposed Amendments to the RegulationsAccordingly, the proposed amendments to 26 CFR Part 1 are as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 1_[AMENDED]</ITAG><T4>Paragraph 1. </T4>The authority for Part 1 continues to read in part:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>26 U.S.C. 7805. * * *</ITAG><T4>Par. 2. </T4>Section 1.861-8(f)(1) (iii) and (vi)(C) is revised toread as follows:<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1.851-8 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Computation of taxable income from sources within the United Statesand from other sources and activities.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG>(f) <T3>Miscellaneous matters_(1) Operative sections. </T3>* * *(iii) <T3>DISC and FSC taxable income. </T3>Sections 925 and 994 provide rulesfor determining the taxable income of a FSC and DISC, respectively, withrespect to qualified sales and leases of export property and qualifiedservices. The combined taxable income method availabe for making determinationof a DISC's taxable income provides, without consideration of export promotionexpenses, that the taxable income of the DISC shall be 50 percent of thecombined taxable income of the DISC and the related supplier derived fromsales and leases of export property and from services. In the FSC context,the taxable income of the FSC equals 23 percent of the combined taxableincome of the FSC and the related supplier. Pursuant to regulations undersections 925 and 994, this section provides rules for determining the deductionsto be taken into account in determining combined taxable income, exceptto the extent modified by the marginal costing rules set forth in the regulationsunder sections 925(b)(2) and 994(b)(2) if used by the taxpayer as providedtherein. <T3>See Examples </T3>(22) and (23) of paragraph (g) of this section.

On January 1,1988, R established FSC, a wholly owned corporation, in a possession ofthe United States. FSC elected under section 922(a)(2) foreign sales corporationstatus. Both R and FSC are calendar year corporations. R entered into awritten agreement with FSC whereby FSC was granted a sales franchise withrespect to the export sales of the electronic equipment, which is exportproperty as defined in section 927(a). Under the agreement, FSC would receivecommissions with respect to those exports equal to the maximum amount permittedto be received under the administrative pricing rules of section 925(a)(1)and (2). The maximum amount will equal the expenses incurred by FSC plusthe maximum profit permitted to be earned by FSC under the pricing rules.In 1988, the profit earned by FSC was $354,424. This profit was determinedusing the combined taxable income administrative pricing method of section925(a)(2). FSC paid taxes to the United States in the amount of $41,914(<T3>i.e., </T3>$354,424 andmultiply; 8/23 andmultiply; .34). The FSC did notpay any foreign tax. On September 15, 1989, FSC paid R a dividend of $312,510(<T3>i.e., </T3>profit less United States tax). The 100% dividends receiveddeduction of section 245(c) applied to this dividend. In 1988, R had totalexport sales of $7,700,000 for which its cost of goods sold was $6,000,000.Thus, its gross income on those sales was $1,700,000. Those sales occurredoutside the United States. Moreover, R had U.S. domestic sales of $12,000,000on which it earned gross income of $900,000. R received royalty incomefrom the foreign license of its electronic technology in the amount of$1,000,000. R's deductible general and administrative expenses allocableto all gross income are $125,000. For purposes of this example, it is assumedthat R did not incur any research and development expenses. In addition,it is assumed that R did not incur any direct selling expenses with respectto either its domestic or foreign sales. FSC incurred $100,000 of expensesrelating to the activities and functions referred to in section 924(c),(d) and (e). FSC will receive the maximum commission and profit under thecombined taxable income method of section 925 (a)(2). Under this method,FSC will receive a profit equal to 23% of the combined taxable income attributableto the export sale of the electronic equipment computed on a product linebasis.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) <T3>Allocation. </T3>For purposes of determining combined taxable incomeof R and FSC from export sales, R's general and administrative expensesof $125,000 must be allocated to and apportioned between gross income resultingfrom the production and sale of the electronic equipment for foreign markets,and from the production and sale of the electronic equipment for the domesticmarket.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(iii) <T3>Apportionment_</T3>(a) <T3>Combined Taxable Income. </T3>In order to compute the combined taxableincome from the production and sale of the electronic equipment, R's generaland administrative expenses of $125,000 are apportioned between the statutorygrouping of gross income under section 863(b) from the export of the electronicequipment and the residual grouping of gross income from domestic salesand foreign licenses. None of R's general and administrative expenses areapportioned to the FSC distribution of $312,510. In the absence of morespecific or contrary information, R's general and administrative expensesmay be apportioned on the basis of gross income in the respective groupings,as follows:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Apportionment of general and administrative expenses to the section863(b) statutory grouping, gross income from exports of electronic equipment:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L1(0,0,0),b1,tp0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,aw,12,33,11</C> <H1>$125,000 andmultiply;</H1><H1>$1,700,000 </H1><H2>($1,700,000+$900,000+$1,000,000) </H2><H1>= $59,028</H1><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Apportionment of general and administrative expenses to the residualgrouping, gross income from domestic sales of electronic equipment, foreignroyalty income from licensing electronic equipment technology:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L1(0,0,0),b1,tp0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,aw,12,33,11</C> <H1>$125,000 andmultiply;</H1><H1>($900,000+$1,000,000)</H1><H2>($1,700,000+$900,000+$1,000,000</H2><H1>= $65,972</H1><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L0,tp0,p0,8/9,g1,t1,i1,s25,12)0</C> <H1> </H1><H1> </H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Total apportionment of general and administrative expenses <D>$125,000</D><R>n,d</R></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">On the basis of this apportionment, the combined taxable income andFSC's portion of the combined taxable income may be calculated as follows:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L0,tp0,p0,8/9,g1,t1,i1,s25,12)0</C> <H1> </H1><H1> </H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Gross income from exports <D>$1,700,000</D></ITAG>Less:<ITAG tagnum="2">FSC section 924(c), (d) and (e) expenses <D>100,000</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Apportioned general and administrative expenses <D>59,028</D><R>n,s</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">Total expenses </ITAG><D>(159,028)</D><R>n,s</R><ITAG tagnum="1">Combined taxable income <D>1,540,972</D><R>n,d</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">FSC's income_23% of combined taxable income <D>354,424</D><R>n,d</R></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(B) <T3>R's section 863(b) taxable income. </T3>R's total section 863(b) taxableincome from the export sales equals 77% of combined taxable income andis computed as follows:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L0,tp0,p8,8/9,g1,t1,i1,s25,12)0</C> <H1> </H1><H1> </H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Gross receipts <D>$7,700,000</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cost of goods sold <D>6,000,000</D><R>n,s</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Gross income <D>1,700,000</D><R>n,s</R></ITAG>Less:<ITAG tagnum="2">Apportioned general and administrative expenses <D>59,028</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Commission to FSC <D>454,424</D><R>n,s</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">Total </ITAG><D>(513,452)</D><R>n,s</R><ITAG tagnum="1">R's taxable income <D>1,186,548</D><R>n,d</R></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As illustrated, all of the general and administrative expenses apportionedto combined taxable income are taken as deductions in computing R's section863(b) taxable income.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(C) <T3>R's foreign source royalty income. </T3>In order to determine the amountof taxable income of R from sources without the United States relatingto the royalty income, the remaining general and administrative expensesof $65,972 are apportioned between the statutory grouping, foreign royaltyincome, and the residual grouping of gross income from sources within theUnited States.

For purposesof this example, it is assumed that R's income qualifies for sourcing onthe basis of <T3>Example</T3> (2) of andSection;1.863-3(b)(2). Accordingly, one-half ofthe income ($593,274) would qualify as foreign source income. However,since the export sales were made using a foreign sales corporation as acommission agent on the sale, section 927(e)(1) will operate to limit R'sforeign source income to $385,243. Under section 927(e)(1), R's foreignsource income on the export transaction may not exceed the amount whichwould have been treated as foreign source income had the comparable DISCpricing rule, in this case the 50% of combined taxable income method, beenused to compute FSC's profit.
