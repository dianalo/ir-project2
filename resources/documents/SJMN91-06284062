Galileo's speed of36,000 miles per hour was reduced by less than one mile per hour to bring iton target for an Oct. 29 rendezvous with the asteroid Gaspra, according to theJet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. The three-ton spacecraft will givescientists their first close-up look ever at an asteroid when it passes withinabout 1,000 miles of Gaspra, but there is a problem.;   The 16-foot-widehigh-gain antenna, which was supposed to open earlier this year like anumbrella, remains stuck in its claw-like position. So the photographs andother scientific data collected during the encounter will be stored in thespacecraft's tape recorder, and scientists may have to wait until November1992 to see the results.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  General News  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  GALILEO'S SPEED CUT; ANTENNA REMAINS STUCK  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  National News in Brief  </MEMO><BYLINE>  Mercury News Wire Services  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911010  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  October  </MONTH><PG.COL>  5E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  153  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday, October 10, 199100284062,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
