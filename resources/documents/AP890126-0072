Helen Suzman's announcement came as the Johannesburg Bar Council,in a rare denunciation of a judicial decision, said it was outragedby the sentence.   The farmer, Jacobus Vorster, tied one of his workers to a treeand beat him with fists and whips over a two-day period in December1987 because the black man, Eric Sambo, accidentally killed one ofVorster's dogs with a tractor.   In November, Justice J.J. Strydom gave Vorster a five-yearsentence that was suspended on condition he pay a 3,000 rand($1,360) fine and pay 130 rand ($55) a month to Sambo's widow andchildren for five years.   The lawyers' council, in a statement today in the Johannesburgnewspaper Business Day, said the suspended jail term and fine were``so grossly inappropriate as to induce not simply a state of shock,but one of outrage.''   The sentence imposed by Strydom in the northern town of LouisTrichardt occurred after Vorster, 22, pleaded guilty to culpablehomicide, an intermediate charge between murder and manslaughterwhen there is no clear proof of premeditation.   The judge said Vorster's guilt was lessened because of his youthand the fact that he had consumed liquor prior to the assault.   South African criminal law does not set specific maximumsentences, leaving that to the judge's discretion. But the head ofthe bar council, Max Labe, said Vorster should have been given a``substantial'' prison term. Labe said in a telephone interview thatculpable homicide sentences usually are less than 10 years but thatthis killing was particularly brutal.   Mrs. Suzman, the longest-serving parliament member with theanti-apartheid Progressive Federal Party, said she would move forStrydom's impeachment when parliament reconvenes Feb. 3.   She described the sentence as ``outrageously lenient.''   The Johannesburg Bar Council said it usually did not comment oncourt rulings, but felt this case was exceptional.   ``If there grew up in the community a belief that such a crimecould merit so trivial a punishment, the maintenance of law andorder would be gravely endangered, and no law-abiding citizen wouldbe safe from violent and callous killers,'' the council said.   Vorster's sentence contrasts with the death sentences issued toseveral blacks who are awaiting execution at Pretoria Central prisonfor murdering white farmers.</TEXT></DOC>
