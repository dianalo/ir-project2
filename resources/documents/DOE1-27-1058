This radiopharmaceutical agent was effective for producing tumorregression in mouse glioma in vivo and for killing human small cell lungcancer cells in vitro. In order to explore the interaction between hyperthermiaand /sup 111/In-BLMC against the human SCLC cells, the N417 cells (NCI)were exposed to 0.9% NaCl, BLM (15 {mu}g/ml) or /sup 111/In-BLMC (40{mu}Ci carried by 15 {mu}g BLM/ml) for 5-90 min. at 37{sup 0}C or 43{sup0}C, plated in soft agarose and incubated 1-2 weeks for colony formation.A synergistic interaction resulted. At 37{sup 0}C, the percent survivalof N417 cells for BLM alone was 27.2% and 12.6% for /sup 111/In-BLMC;at 43{sup 0}C, it was 6.7*% for BLM alone and 2.0% for /sup 111/In-BLMC(exposed 60 min.). The radiation dose was 82 rads in two weeks for colonyformation. An obvious effectiveness was observed when heat and /sup 111/In-BLMCwere obtained at the same time. /sup 111/In-BLMC combined with hyperthermiamay increase effectiveness for the treatment of patients with tumorssensitive to BLM.</TEXT></DOC>
