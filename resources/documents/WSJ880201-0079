The next meeting will be set after each side studies the other's proposals. As previously reported, a proposal on regulating subsidies to the European aircraft consortium submitted at last week's meeting by U.S. representatives was termed unacceptable by a senior European official, who said it was too detailed and stringent.    The U.S. says that subsidies to Airbus from the British, French, German and Spanish governments give the consortium an unfair advantage over U.S. aircraft manufacturers. The Europeans counter that the U.S. companies receive indirect subsidies through U.S. defense contracts. </TEXT></DOC>
