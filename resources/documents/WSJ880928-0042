Allied-Signal said the transaction was called off because certain sale conditions weren't &quot;mutually satisfied.&quot; Asked if the sale cancellation was related to Department of Defense concerns about transfers of sensitive technology, a spokesman said, &quot;We aren't characterizing the reasons for the termination.&quot;    Sylmar, Calif.-based Ocean Defense is a leading maker of anti-submarine warfare equipment, including helicopter dipping sonar. Ocean Defense has annual sales of about $100 million.    The Allied-Signal spokesman said, &quot;We are continuing to talk to interested parties&quot; about buying Ocean Defense. AlliedSignal announced the sale of the unit as part of a strategy to concentrate its aerospace business on aircraft systems for the commercial and military markets.    Thomson, a large electronics firm, has an anti-submarine warfare unit with about $300 million in sales. </TEXT></DOC>
