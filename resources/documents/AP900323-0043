Hazelwood was convicted Thursday of a misdemeanor charge ofnegligent discharge of oil but acquitted of three other moreserious counts, including drunkenness and recklessness. He faces apossible 90 days in jail and a $1,000 fine.   Exxon said the verdicts seemed to confirm the spill last year ofalmost 11 million gallons of crude from the company's Exxon Valdeztanker was an accident.   But former Valdez Mayor John Devens said the issue never wasHazelwood.   ``There will always be Joe Hazelwoods,'' Devens said. The spillshowed that industry does not have the technology to deal with oilspills of that magnitude, and that prevention must be stressed, hesaid.   ``The real issue confronting the state of Alaska is whetherindustry is prepared to prevent another oil spill,'' Devens said.   The state filed a civil lawsuit against Exxon on Aug. 15,joining more than 150 other civil litigants.   ``The result bears out the fact that there are other peopleresponsible for this, other than Capt. Hazelwood,'' Gov. SteveCowper said.   Exxon officials in New York reacted with apparent optimismfollowing the verdict.   ``We are pleased that the ordeal of the trial is over for Capt.Hazelwood and his family. The verdict would seem to confirm theview that the grounding of the Exxon Valdez was an accident,'' saidExxon spokesman Jim Morakis.   ``In light of pending litigation any other comment would beinappropriate,'' the company said.   In Juneau, Alaska Attorney General Douglas Baily said that hewas pleased with the verdict, which he said should not have anymajor effect on pending civil and criminal cases against Exxon.   ``I suppose in an ideal world we would have preferred to havebeen more successful on some of the other counts,'' Baily said.``But we certainly accept the jury's verdict.''   But Assistant District Attorney Brent Cole, who argued the case,said he was disappointed and remains convinced that Hazelwood wasdrunk when the ship ran aground.   Defense attorney Dick Madson said the defense plans to appeal ongrounds that federal law preempts state law concerning oil spillsand that a person who reports an oil spill, as Hazelwood did, isimmune from prosecution.   Marnie Isaacs, spokeswoman for Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., theconsortium of oil companies that run the trans-Alaska pipeline,said, ``Many, many factors contributed to the grounding of theValdez, in addition to the actions of the captain.''   The Hazelwood verdicts are only the beginning of determiningresponsibility for the disaster, some environnmentalists said.   Bruce Manheim, spokesman for the Environmental Defense Fund inWashington, D.C., said, ``We're certainly disappointed with thatresult but, nonetheless, we believe the real trial has yet tobegin.''</TEXT></DOC>
