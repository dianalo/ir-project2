It alleged that Lt. Col. William R. Higgins was a spy for the``Satanic CIA.'' U.S. and U.N. officials denied the charges.   In a rescue attempt, Shiite Moslem militiamen spent a second daysearching citrus groves and cave-lined valleys for Higgins, whodisappeared Wednesday.   The searchers, who belong to the Amal militia headed by JusticeMinister Nabih Berri, also seized six activists of theIranian-backed Hezbollah in pre-dawn house raids in Tyre andaccused them of involvement in the plot.   Higgins, 43, of Danville, Ky., was head of a 76-man UnitedNations observer force in south Lebanon. About 15 of the observersassigned to the force are Americans.   Observers from the United Nations Truce Supervisory Organizationwork alongside the 5,800-strong United Nations Interim Force inLebanon, deployed in 1978 at the Lebanon-Israel border.   Gunmen abducted the colonel south of Tyre as he drove to UNIFILheadquarters in the border town of Naqoura. U.N. officialsinitially said that Higgins was violating U.N. rules for travel byAmericans.   But a U.N. spokesman in New York said Friday that Higgins didnot violate travel restrictions.   ``As all his predecessors, he traveled freely in the areawithout escort,'' said Mario Zamorano, a spokesman for the U.N.secretary-general.   In Washington, President Reagan said the United States will notwithdraw Americans from the U.N. observer group in Lebanon despitethe abduction. Earlier in the day, Defense Secretary Frank Carluccihad said U.S. officials were studying a withdrawal plan.   The reponsibility claim came in a typewritten Arabic statementfrom the Organization of the Oppressed on Earth. It called Higgins``one of the biggest spies planting daily terror in our land.''   It alleged that Higgins used his oberver role as a cover forespionage work.   U.S. officials have denied that Higgins has links with the CIA,and U.N. Undersecretary-General Marrack Goulding echoed that denialFriday in a news conference at Naqoura.   ``We do not recruit spies. Everyone here works for the UnitedNations,'' he said.   Dan Howard, the Pentagon's chief spokesman, acknowledged inWashington Friday that Higgins for two years was junior militaryassistant to then-Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger. Howarddismissed suggestions, however, that Higins' capture posed anymajor security risk to the United States.   He provided a statement to reporters after Radio Free Lebanonbroadcast a story in Arabic quoting unnamed individuals as sayingHiggins had an association with Weinberger.   The Oppressed of the Earth said it would release Higginsfollowing a complete Israeli withdrawal from its security zone insouth Lebanon. It also demanded the release of an estimated 300Lebanese and Palestinian prisoners held in the Israeli-supervisedKhiam detention camp in south Lebanon and the immediate cessationof U.S. activity in Lebanon.   The communique was delivered to a Western news agency in Beirutalong with photocopies of two identity cards, one in English andone in Hebrew. Both carried a picture of Higgins and a signature.   U.N. spokesman Timur Goksel said the number on one of the cardsmatched the number of a card that had been issued to Higgins by theUnited Nations. Officials said Higgins had a Hebrew identity cardbecause U.N. forces often come into contact with Israeli troops.   ``We have caught the throat of the American serpent, criminalagent of the Satanic CIA,'' said the statement of the Shiiteextremist group.   It was the second responsibility claim in two days, but it wasthe first to be accompanied by any proof. The first came Thursdayin a call from a man claiming to speak for a previously unknowngroup calling itself the Islamic Revolutionary Brigades.   The Oppressed of the Earth is comprised of zealots loyal toIran's revolutionary patriarch, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.   It has claimed responsibility for hijackings, bombings andkidnappings including the abduction of 12 Lebanese Jews in Moslemwest Beirut since 1984, eight of whom it said it killed.   The group also claims responsibility for the June 1985 hijackingof a TWA jetliner in which a U.S. Navy diver was slain.   The Higgins abduction brings the number of foreign hostages inLebanon to 25, including nine Americans. Most are believed held bypro-Iranian Shiite extremists, whose main Hezbollah militia hasbeen challenging Amal's dominance in south Lebanon.   Amal militiamen sealed off a 300-square-mile area around Tyre toblock escape routes for the captors.   ``We have done everything possible to prevent the kidnappersfrom moving Col. Higgins around,'' Goulding said at the Naqouranews conference.   Higgins was the first American whose abduction was claimed bythe Oppressed on Earth and the third U.N. official to be abductedin south Lebanon in two weeks.   A Swede and a Norwegian serving with the U.N. Relief and WorksAgency that cares for Palestinian refugees were kidnapped near thesouth Lebanon city of Sidon on Feb. 5.   Their alleged captors have released two statements in which theyaccused the two Scandinavians of espionage activities. UNRWA hasblamed their abduction on Palestinians acting without politicalmotivation or links to any organization.</TEXT></DOC>
