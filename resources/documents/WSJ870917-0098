That may seem like an absurd question. The Socialists still control the presidency and are the single largest party in the French National Assembly, and newspapers are full of reports about Socialist candidates for next spring's presidential elections.    But will the Socialist Party be running on a socialist platform, a moderate platform -- or any platform at all? Just as U.S. presidential aspirant Walter Mondale once jolted Gary Hart with the question, one is tempted to ask the French Socialist Party: &quot;Ou est le boeuf?&quot; -- Where's the beef?    Ousted from power last year in parliamentary elections, the Socialist Party still seems to be reeling from its defeat. It has been remarkably silent while the conservative government undoes much of what it did, such as selling to the public companies that the Socialists nationalized five years ago. Instead of debating issues, the Socialists are engaged in an internal squabble over who should be the party's candidate in the presidential elections if President Francois Mitterrand doesn't run.    Nobody knows where the Socialist Party stands: Does it still believe in the left-wing ideology that propelled it to power in 1981, or has it become the pragmatic, social-democratic party it became later?    Jean-Francois Kahn, editor of the left-leaning weekly L'evenement du Jeudi, said in an editorial on the silence of the Socialists: &quot;You probably want to know if the Socialist Party still intends to forge an alliance with the Communist Party; whether socialism is still the order of the day or whether pragmatic reformism has replaced it; whether they'll renationalize or continue to privatize; what social reforms will remain in the program? Hang up! We'll call you later.&quot;    The Socialists have all sorts of justifications for their silence. They say they wouldn't be credible proclaiming that they have a solution to the country's problems so soon after losing elections. Others say that it simply looks as if they have no new ideas because the conservatives have moved closer to the Socialists' views on such topics as strengthening European unity or dealing with unemployment.    They also say they are inhibited by the awkwardness of &quot;cohabitation&quot; between a right-wing government and a Socialist president, born out of the conservative parliamentary victory in 1986 while Mr. Mitterrand still had two years left in his term. If they criticize the government too much, they say, it could ricochet and weaken Mr. Mitterrand. Mr. Mitterrand won't say if he will seek re-election next year; until he decides, the Socialists are paralyzed.    Amid these arguments, the Socialists aren't talking about the fundamental reason for their silence: They don't know what to think anymore. The Socialists' pre-1981 certainties didn't withstand the realities of power. Forced to adopt pragmatic, market-oriented policies, they didn't adapt their rhetoric to the change. Now they seem adrift, ideologically bankrupt.    &quot;There have been no ideas, no new proposals&quot; from the Socialists, says conservative Social Affairs Minister Philippe Seguin. &quot;The Socialists are brain dead.&quot;    While less vociferous, many Socialists agree.    Some moderate Socialists, like Michel Rocard, who has announced his candidacy, say the experience of power taught the Socialists that there isn't much of an alternative policy. For example, asked to name the Socialists' priorities, a top party official listed increasing European unity, boosting the competitiveness of French companies, solidarity (meaning more social programs), education, job training.    The next day, Jacques Barrot, a moderate member of the right, listed what he saw as essential themes: &quot;improving the competitiveness of companies and job training, solidarity between men and an opening up to Europe and the world.&quot;    The lack of differences between right and left disturbs some. Jean-Pierre Chevenement recently said he would seek the Socialist nomination if Mr. Mitterrand doesn't run. He said he would shake up the party, which is &quot;anesthetized&quot; and has &quot;abdicated all ambition&quot; to transforming society. Socialists say the left still believes the state should play a role in the economy, though not necessarily through sweeping nationalization, and that they want more social justice than the right. </TEXT></DOC>
