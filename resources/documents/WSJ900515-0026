By pushing up the potential date for a combined vote fromsometime late next year, Mr. Kohl obliquely raised thepossibility that the next election involving him would be forchancellor of a united Germany rather than of West Germanyalone. Given the poor showing of his Christian Democratsparty during the weekend, it appears a unified Germanelection would give him a better chance to win.</LP><TEXT>   This weekend's voting signals the depth of his problems.In North Rhine-Westphalia and Lower Saxony, two states thattogether account for more than 40% of the nation's registeredvoters, Mr. Kohl's Christian Democrats suffered embarrassingdefeats and lost control of the upper house of the WestGerman parliament, made up of representatives from thestates. The elections were touted as litmus tests of Bonn'spolicy on German unity.   Mr. Kohl is thought to privately favor a combined electionin December, which would effectively merge the two nationsinto a single political entity. But he has never openlyendorsed such a plan, and he has no power to dictate such aproposal.   In a news conference, Mr. Kohl said he didn't &quot;rule out&quot;an election taking place in East Germany on the same day asthe West German Bundestag election, set for Dec. 2. But hedidn't elaborate.   West German sources say that the weekend election has leftMr. Kohl on the political defensive and in need of a strategyshift. &quot;The elections in those two states have added to thepressure to just hold a combined German election and get itover with,&quot; says one government official.   The West German leader would almost certainly stand abetter chance in a combined German vote. In East Germany'sfirst free elections, which took place in March, theChristian Democrats, the sister party to Mr. Kohl's party inthe West, scored a dazzling victory over the SocialDemocrats.   Mr. Kohl is also under pressure from his political alliesin Bonn to push for an early combined election. The leader ofthe Free Democrats, Otto Lambsdorff, repeated his party'scall for a merged German election on Dec. 2 or Jan. 13. TheFree Democrats are the junior partner in Bonn'sright-of-center coalition. Mr. Lambsdorff, who heaped allblame for the weekend's election results on Mr. Kohl'sChristian Democrats, said the longer the country waited forunification, the more difficult it would become.   Against this background, Germans on both sides of theborder appear to be having second thoughts about the rushtoward early unity. East Germans are worried about the impactof massive unemployment and other uncertainties as theyplunge into a free-market system, while the West Germans arebeginning to grumble about the potential costs to their ownhighly prosperous society.   These anxieties have created a ripe target for theopposition Social Democrats, who have campaigned on the ideathat Bonn is moving too fast.</TEXT></DOC>
