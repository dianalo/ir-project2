To returnthe system from abnormality to normality, it is first necessary to determinethe cause of the abnormality. System abnormality diagnosis is indispensableto system operation. Aiming to build a high-grade diagnosing expert systemcapable of flexible coping with cases with which the system is unfamiliar,a new diagnosis method was proposed. This method consists of repeatedverification by means of hypothesis generation and event simulation.This method was applied to network fault diagnosis in protective relaysystems. This showed that this method enables correct diagnosis evenin the absence of superficial knowledge, thus ensuring its effectiveness.This method can be applied not only to network fault diagnosis but alsoto the diagnosis of electric systems and plants.
