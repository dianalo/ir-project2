The findings, on top of other recent research describingmisuse of anti-depressant medicines in nursing homes, raisetroubling questions about the quality of care many patientsreceive.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Nursing homes are mental institutions -- the prevalenceof mental disorders is high,&quot; says Barry W. Rovner, associateprofessor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at JohnsHopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore. &quot;But thesystem of care doesn't recognize that.&quot; The facilities &quot;arerun by people who don't know the first thing about mentaldisorders.&quot;   The new study found that patients diagnosed with majordepressive disorders when admitted to a nursing home were 59%more likely to die within a year from various causes thanwere those patients without such disorders. Researcherscouldn't say what accounted for the higher risk, but theynoted that other studies have shown that depression inelderly patients contributes to poor nutrition, inadequaterest and impaired immune-system function -- all of whichcould lead to failing health and death. The results wereadjusted to account for the seriousness of patients'illnesses as well as other factors.   The researchers found that upon admission, patients withdepression and depressive symptoms scored better in cognitiveand physical functioning than patients who weren't depressed.This finding suggests that with proper treatment, thecondition of depressed patients could improve. But doctors atthe nursing homes diagnosed major depression in just 14% ofpatients whom researchers determined suffered from majordepression; furthermore, only 21% of patients with majordepression were being treated for it.   &quot;Depression isn't just a normal part of aging; it's anabnormal clinical condition that can be treatedsuccessfully,&quot; says Dr. Rovner, principal author of thestudy. The report, which appears in today's Journal of theAmerican Medical Association, estimates that 450,000 nursinghome patients in the U.S. have depressive disorders, orsymptoms, that can be treated.   Researchers tracked 454 patients admitted to eight nursinghomes operated by Meridian Healthcare Inc., Baltimore,between February 1987 and March 1988. Patients were evaluatedat admission by a research psychiatrist not affiliated withthe nursing homes. Researchers found that 13% of the patientshad major depressive disorder, and another 18% had depressivesymptoms.   Arnold Richman, chairman of Meridian, says the resultspoint out the need for psychiatrists who specialize ingeriatric care and are trained to make what can be subtledistinctions between mental illness and other ailments commonto the elderly who are admitted to nursing homes.   He says his company has worked with Johns Hopkinsresearchers on other studies, and uses findings to helpimprove patient care. One such program has demonstrablyimproved care of patients with Alzheimers disease, he says.</TEXT></DOC>
