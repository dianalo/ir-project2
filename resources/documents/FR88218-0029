The revision is necessaryto clarify and update the current version of this regulation. The revisionclarifies organizational responsibilities, revises the list of actionswhich are categorically excluded from environmental impact analysis, clarifiespublic involvement procedures, and provides new guidance on mitigationand monitoring of environmental impacts. It states the Army's policy onincorporation of NEPA procedures into the Remedial Investigation/FeasibilityStudy (RI/FS) stages of hazardous substance cleanup actions required underthe Comprehensive Environmental Response, Cleanup and Liability Act, asamended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (CERCLA/SARA).It requires that mitigations to which the Army commits itself in a NEPAenvironmental document must be identified for funding as line item(s) inthe project budget. The revised regulation incorporates field experienceand other experiences since the last publication of the regulation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Comments must be received no later than close of businesson March 18, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Send written comments to COL Ronald G.

Decision makers shall be consciousof, and responsible for, the impact of their decisions on cultural resources,soils, forests, rangelands, water and air quality, and fish and wildlife,as well as other natural resources under their stewardship. The DA willendeavor to ensure the wise use of natural resources on Army land. Thisregulation is in accordance with 42 USC 4321, et. seq., ``National EnvironmentalPolicy Act of 1969'' (NEPA), the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ)regulations of 29 November 1978 as amended, 40 CFR Parts 1500-1508, andExecutive Order 12114, ``Environmental Effects Abroad of Major FederalActions'', 4 January 1979.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 651.2</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Background.</ITAG>(a) NEPA establishes national policies and goals for environmental protection.Section 102(2) of NEPA contains procedural requirements for the attainmentof such goals. In particular, it requires the Army, along with all Federalagencies, to consider, through their planning and decisionmaking, environmentaleffects of their proposed actions. The Army shall identify significantenvironmental effects of proposed programs and projects in adequate detail.These effects will be considered in the decision process along with technical,economic and other necessary factors.(b) EO 11991 (24 May 1977) directed the CEQ to issue regulations implementingNEPA's procedural provisions. Accordingly, CEQ issued final regulationsfor implementing NEPA's procedural provisions (40 CFR Part 1500-1508) on29 November 1978. These regulations became binding on all Federal agencieson 30 July 1979. The regulations provide that each Federal agency shalladopt procedures to supplement the CEQ regulations. The Department of Defense(DOD) issued its implementing procedures in DOD Directive 6050.1 on 30July 1979, ``Environmental Effects in the United States of DOD Actions''.(c) Executive Order 12114 directs that Federal agencies prepare proceduresto implement the EO with respect to areas outside the United States. Accordingly,DOD issued DOD Directive 6050.7, ``Environmental Effects Abroad of MajorDepartment of Defense Actions,'' 31 March 1979.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 651.3</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Applicability.</ITAG>(a) Subparts A through G and Appendices A through D in this regulationapply to: Headquarters, Department of the Army (HQDA), Army Staff (ARSTAF),all Army Commands, Army Reserve, and Army National Guard (ARNG), and toall subordinate activity and agency (hereinafter referred to as Army agencies)actions affecting the environment in the United States,\1\<NOTE/> and are effective immediately.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ <T3>United States </T3>means the 50 states, the District of Columbia, territories,and possessions of the United States and all waters and airspace subjectto the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.

Itis a signed statement to be submitted with project documentation. It isused when the proposed action is exempt from the requirements of NEPA,or has been adequately assessed in existing documents and determined notto be environmentally significant. A REC is also used to document the useof those categorical exclusions which require such records. See Figure2-1 for a suggested format which contains the elements of a REC.(b) <T3>Environmental Assessment (EA). </T3>An EA is a document which: (1) Briefly provides the decisionmaker with sufficient evidence and analysisfor determining whether the action should result in a FNSI or whether anEIS should be prepared.(2) Assures compliance with NEPA, if an EIS is not required and a CX isinappropriate.(3) Facilitates preparation of a required EIS.(4) Shall include brief discussions of the need for the proposed action,alternatives to the proposed actions (see NEPA, Section (2)(e)), the proposedand alternative actions' environmental impacts, and a listing of personsand agencies consulted.(c) <T3>Finding of No Significant Impact (FNSI). </T3>A FNSI is a documentwhich briefly states why an action will not significantly affect the environment,thus voiding the requirement for an EIS. The FNSI shall include a summaryof the conclusions of the EA and shall note any environmental documents(ED) related to it. If the EA is attached, the FNSI need not repeat anyof the EA's discussion, but may incorporate it by reference.(d) <T3>Notice of Intent (NOI). </T3>An NOI is a public notice that an EISwill be prepared and considered. The NOI shall briefly:(1) Describe the proposed and alternative actions.(2) Describe the proposed scoping process, including whether, when, andwhere any public meeting(s) will be held.(3) State the name and address of the POC who can answer questions on theproposed action and its EIS.(e) <T3>Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). </T3>An EIS is a detailed writtenstatement required by NEPA for major Federal actions with significant environmentaleffects [42 U.S.C. 4321, section 102(2)(c)]. (f) <T3>Life Cycle Environmental Document (LCED). </T3>The LCED is intendedto be a programmatic assessment which addresses the known and reasonablyforeseeable environmental impacts of a proposed item/system during allphases of development, production, use, and ultimate disposal of the item/system.The LCED may be in the form of an EA or an EIS, and must be supplementedto address additional significant environmental impacts as conditions change.The LCED will be prepared by the DA proponent/developer (or program manager)and is most frequently used within the material research, development,and acquisition community.(g) <T3>Record of Decision. </T3>A public Record of Decision (ROD) is requiredunder the provisions of 40 CFR 1505.2 after completion of an EIS. Nevertheless,the ROD is not considered to be an environmental document since the decisionconsiders other factors in addition to environmental issues.(h) <T3>Reports control symbol (RCS). </T3>To comply with AR 335-11 as specifiedin EP 335-1-1, the legend ``RCS DD-M (AR) 1327'' will appear on the signaturepage of all EAs and EISs.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 651.7a</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Optional documents.</ITAG>The following additional documents may assist in the implementation ofthis regulation. These documents are optional, but their use is encouraged.(a) <T3>Environmental Planning Guide. </T3>Prepared prior to or at the outsetof a major program concept exploration. It is a concise (e.g., 10 page)document intended for use by the program planners and designers. It providesguidelines and supporting rationale by which planners and designers couldprevent, avoid, or minimize adverse environmental effects through environmentallysensitive design and planning. Through appropriate language in the Scopeof Work, contractors can be encouraged or required to use such an EnvironmentalPlanning Guide.(b) <T3>Environmental Planning Record. </T3>This records the progress and processof environmental considerations throughout a given program's development.Ideally it is a document which is written when the program commences. Thereis no set form; essentially, it may be a journal with periodic entries,a file of memos, trip reports, etc. This document is a visible track recordof how environmental factors have actually been considered and incorporatedthroughout the planning process. Through appropriate language in the Scopeof Work, contractors can be encouraged or required to prepare an EnvironmentalPlanning Record, or parts thereof.(c) <T3>Environmental Monitoring Report. </T3>This is prepared at one or morepoints after program or action execution. Its purpose is to determine theaccuracy of impact predications. It can serve as the basis for adjustmentsin mitigation programs, and can also serve to adjust impact predictionsin future projects.<ITAG tagnum="84">andSection; 651.7b Environmental documentation terms.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Categorical Exclusion (CX). </T3>A CX (40 CFR 1508.4) is a categoryof actions which do not require an EA or an EIS because DA has determinedthat the actions do not have an individual or cumulative impact on theenvironment. If qualifications are met for a CX (See andSection; 651.16 andscreening questions at Appendix A), a Record of Environmental Considerationmay be required. The Army Environmental Office will maintain for all Armyagencies a master list of actions which normally qualify for a categoricalexclusion. This list will include those identified in this regulation (AppendixA), and those nominated by Army agencies and approved by HQDA. Refer toSubpart D for further discussion.(b) <T3>Major Federal Action. </T3>In this regulation, the phrase ``major federalaction'' reinforces, but does not have a meaning independent of, ``significantlyaffecting the environment,'' and shall be interpreted in that context.``Major federal action'' is not a determinant in a decision to prepareor not prepare environmental documentation.(c) <T3>Significantly affecting the environment. </T3>This phrase describesan action, program or project which would violate existing pollution standards;cause water, air, noise, soil or underground pollution; impair visibilityfor substantial periods of any day; cause interference with the reasonablepeaceful enjoyment of property or use of property; create an interferencewith visual or auditory amenities; limit multiple use management programsfor an area; cause danger to the health, safety, or welfare of human life;or cause irreparable harm to animal or plant life in an area. Also see40 CFR 1508.27.(d) <T3>Proponent. </T3>Proponent identification is dependent on the natureand scope of a proposed action.(1) Proponency may reside with any Army or ARNG structure. For instance,the Army/ARNG installation/activity Facility Engineer (FE)/Director ofEngineering and Housing becomes the proponent of installation-wide MCA/MCARNGand Oandamp;M/OMARNG Activity; the State ARNG Facility Management Officer(FMO) becomes the proponent of State-wide MCARNG/OMARNG Activity; Commander,TRADOC becomes the proponent of a change in initial entry training; theState Adjutant General becomes the proponent of a proposal to establisha new ARNG facility (Training Site, Army Aviation Support Facility (AASF),Armory, Organizational Maintenance Shop (OMS), Combined Support MaintenanceShop (CSMS), Army Aviation Classification Repair Activity Depot (AVCRAD),Mobilization and Training Equipment Site (MATES), Unit Training and EquipmentSite (UTES), etc.). The proponent may or may not be the preparer.(2) In general, the proponent is the lowest level decisionmaker. This isthe unit, element, or organization which is responsible for initiatingand/or carrying out the proposed action. The proponent has the responsibilityto prepare and/or secure funding for preparation of the environmental documentation.MCA/MCAR funds may not be used for preparation of environmental documents.OMA/OMAR or other operating funds are the proper sources of funds for environmentaldocument preparation.(3) The Chief, Installations Division (NGB-ARI) and the Chief, EnvironmentalResources Branch (NGB-ARI-E) have supervisory responsibility for the ARNGEnvironmental Program. In specific cases, such as the construction of awater treatment facility or a flood control plan, the Engineer could bethe proponent. The Engineer (NGB-ARI/FMO) and/or his Environmental ManagementStaff should advise proponents as to the format and technical data whichmust be considered in the Environmental Document (ED). The Engineer's EnvironmentalManagement Staff is, however, responsible for reviewing each ED for compliancewith NEPA and appropriate Army and/or ARNG Regulations. No matter who preparesthe environmental document, the proponent remains responsible for its contentand conclusions.(4) The decisionmaking process often subjects proposal decisions to reviewand/or approval by higher level authorities including ARSTAF proponent;therefore, the review/approval of the environmental document follows thesame channel of review/approval as that of the proposed action.(e) <T3>ARSTAF Proponent. </T3>As the principal planner, implementor, and decisionauthority for a proposed action, it is responsible for the substantivereview of the environmental documentation and its thorough considerationin the decisionmaking process.(f) <T3>Preparers. </T3>Personnel from a variety of disciplines who write environmentaldocumentation in clear and analytical prose.

(b) To achieve these ends, NEPA requires, and the Army will use, a systematic,interdisciplinary approach which ensures the integrated use of the naturaland social sciences, planning, and the environmental design arts. Thisapproach will be applied to all Army decisionmaking which may have an impacton the human environment [Pub. L. 91-190; section 102(2)(A)]. This approachallows timely identification of environmental effects and values in sufficientdetail for evaluation concurrently with economic, technical, and mission-relatedanalyses at the earliest possible step in the decision process. It is Armypolicy that when EAs/EISs are undertaken, the economic and social impactsshall be included in the analysis of total environmental impacts. However,these secondary impacts, unaccompanied by physical environmental impacts,should not determine whether or not to prepare an environmental document. (c) The NEPA process also requires the proponent of an action or projectto identify and describe appropriate alternatives to the proposed actionor project. To assist in identifying appropriate alternatives, the proponentmust consult appropriate Federal, State and local agencies and the generalpublic.  (d) These procedures will assist the decisionmaker to select a preferredcourse of action. They provide the relevant background information andsubsequent analyses of the proposal's positive and negative environmentaleffects. The decisionmaker's written environmental evaluation is eithera CX with a REC, an EA with a FNSI, or an EIS.  <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;651.9  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Applicability.  </ITAG>(a) The types of projects or actions to evaluate for environmental impactinclude:  (1) Policies, regulations, and procedures (e.g., Army regulations, circulars,or other issuances).  (2) New management and operational concepts and programs (in areas suchas logistics, RDTE, procurement, personnel assignment).  (3) Projects (e.g., facilities construction, research and development forweapons, vehicles, and other equipment).  (4) Activities (e.g. individual and unit training, flight operations, overalloperation of an installation or facility test and evaluation programs). (5) Requests for a Nuclear Regulatory Commission license (new, renewal,or amendment) or an Army radiation authorization.  (6) Materiel development, acquisition, and/or transition.  (7) Research and development (in areas such as genetic engineering, lasertesting, electromagnetic pulse generation).  (8) Installation Restoration (IR) projects undertaken pursuant to section104 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and LiabilityAct (CERCLA), as amended by the Superfund Amendments and ReauthorizationAct (CERCLA/SARA). The National Oil and Hazardous Substances ContingencyPlan (40 CFR Part 300), implements the requirements of CERCLA/SARA, anddescribes a formal process, the feasibility study (FS), which provides(a) substantive and procedural standards to ensure full consideration ofenvironmental issues and alternatives and (b) opportunity for the publicto participate in evaluating environmental factors and alternatives beforea final decision is made. In most cases, when a FS is prepared in accordancewith 40 CFR Part 300, a second NEPA document is not required. As a matterof policy, the organization preparing the FS shall ensure the documentalso complies with 40 CFR 1502.16 (CEQ regulations implementing the provisionsof NEPA). The cover of the FS document and the subsequent Record of Decisionshall contain the legend ``This document is intended to comply with theNational Environmental Policy Act of 1969.'' All public notices announcingthe availability of the FS shall also note this intent. IRP actions inwhich a FS is not prepared in accordance with 40 CFR Part 300 will requireappropriate environmental documentation.  (b) In addition to the above, certain activities supported by the Armythrough the following actions require proper environmental documentation: (1) Federal contracts, grants, subsidies, loans, or other forms of fundingsuch as GOCO industrial plants and section 801\3\<NOTE/> Housing (via third-party contracting).  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\Section 801 of the Military Construction AuthorizationAct of 1984, 10 U.S.C. 2828 (Pub. L. 98-115).  (2) Leases, easements, permits, licenses, certificates, or other entitlementfor use (e.g., grazing lease, grant of easement for highway right-of-way). (3) Request for approval to use or store materials, radiation sources,hazardous and toxic material or wastes on Army land. If the requester isnon-Army, the responsibility to prepare the proper environmental documentationis that of the non-Army requestor. If required, the requestor will provideinformation needed for the Army review. The Army reviews and approves allenvironmental documentation before approving the request.  <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;651.10  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Categories of actions and procedures for environmental review.  </ITAG>There are five broad categories into which a proposed action may fall forenvironmental review. These categories are:  (a) <T3>Exemption by Law. </T3>The law must apply to the Department of Defenseand/or Army and must prohibit, exempt, or make impossible full compliancewith NEPA. (40 CFR 1500.6). Also see andSection;651.11 for security exemptions. (b) <T3>Emergencies. </T3>(1) In the event of an emergency, the Army may needto take immediate actions that have significant environmental impacts.These include immediate actions taken to promote the national defense orsecurity and actions necessary for the protection of life or property.In such cases the ARSTAF proponent shall notify the Army EnvironmentalOffice, which in turn will then notfiy OASA (Iandamp;L) who will coordinatewith the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Production and Logistics regardingthe emergency action. Time is of the essence so that OASA (Iandamp;L) mayconsult with the CEQ if necessary. A public affairs plan should be developedas soon as possible so that channels of communication remain open betweenthe media, public and the installation. In no event shall Army delay anemergency action necessary for national defense, security or preservationof human life or property to comply with this regulation or the CEQ Regulations(40 CFR Parts 1500-1508). State call-ups of ARNG during a natural disasterare excluded from this consultation requirement.  (2) These notifications apply only to actions necessary to control immediateeffects of the emergency; other actions remain subject to NEPA review.(40 CFR 1506.11)       (3) After action reports may be required at the discretion of the OASA(Iandamp;L).(c) <T3>Categorical Exclusions (CX). </T3>These actions (see Subpart D andAppendix A) normally do not require an EA or an EIS. The Army has determinedthat they do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effecton the human environment. Qualification for a CX is described in SubpartD of this regulation.(d) <T3>Environmental Assessment. Actions normally requiring an EA (andSection;andSection;651.20 and 651.21). </T3>(1) If the proposed action is adequately coveredwithin an existing EA or EIS, prepare a REC to that effect (See Figure2-1).(2) If the proposed action is within the general scope of an existing EAor EIS, but requires additional information, prepare a new environmentaldocument which considers the new, modified, or missing information. Incorporate,by reference, existing documents and publish the conclusion (FNSI or NOI).(3) If the proposed action is not covered adequately in any existing EAor EIS, or is of significantly larger scope than that decribed in the existingdocument, then prepare an EA followed by either a FNSI or a new EIS.(e) <T3>Environmental Impact Statement. Actions normally requiring an EIS (andSection;andSection;651.27 and 651.28). </T3>(1) If it is determined that the action is coveredadequately in a previously filed Final EIS (FEIS), the REC must so state,citing the applicable FEIS by name and date. The REC is then attached tothe proponent's record copy of that FEIS.(2) If the proposed action is within the scope of an existing FEIS butwas not covered in that document or not covered adequately, then the proponentmust prepare supplemental documentation to that FEIS.(3) If the proposed action is not within the scope of any existing EIS,then the proponent must begin the preparation of a new EIS.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 651.10a </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Determining appropriate environmental documentation.</ITAG>(a) The flow chart shown in Figure 3-1 summarizes the process for determiningdocumentation requirements.(b) The proponent of a proposed action may adopt appropriate environmentdocuments (EAs or EISs) prepred by another agency (40 CFR 1500.4(n) and1506.3). In such cases, the proponent will retain its own record keepingfor RECs and RODs. See 40 CFR 1506.3 for procedures to follow when adoptingother documents.(c) When an existing adequate EA or EIS is used in lieu of preparationof a new document, the REC should so state the document title, date, andwhere it may be reviewed.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 651.11 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Classified actions.</ITAG>(a) 40 CFR 1507.3(c) covers limited exceptions to the procedural requirementsof this regulation for proposed classified actions. Follow the provisionsof AR 380-5 with respect to public dissemination of environmental documentscontaining classified information.(b) Separate classified form unclassified facts and conclusions relatedto the proposed action. The processing of unclassified portions of theaction may then proceed routinely in accordance with this regulation. Theclassified portions are kept separate for reviewers and decisionmakerswith need-to-know as defined in AR 380-5 and andSection; 651.11(c).(c) Classification does not relieve a proponent of the necessity to assessand document the environmental effects of the proposed action. The ARSTAFproponent, in coordination with the Army Environmental Office and the DeputyChief of Staff for Intelligence, Security Divisions (DAMI-CIS), may selecta review team. The team may be drawn from the Army agency or office notconnected with the proponent agency, or from agencies outside the Army.The review team's purpose is to provide an external review of classifiedenvironmental documents.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>[Editorial note: </T4>This flow chart will be published in the finalrule]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">Figure 3-1 Flow Chart Summarizing Process for Determination of DocumentRequirements</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 651.12 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Integration with Army planning. </ITAG>(a) The Army goal is to integrate environmental reviews concurrently withother Army planning and decisionmaking actions. This concurrent reviewavoids delays in mission accomplishments. To achieve this goal, ARSTAFshould provide complete environmental documents for early inclusion withany recommendation or report to the decisiomakers (Master Plan, NaturalResource Management Plan, RI/FS, etc.). The same documents shall be forwardedto the planners, designers, and/or implementors so recommendations andmitigations on which the decision was based may be carried out. (b) <T3>Time limits. </T3>The timing of the preparation, circulation, submission,and public availability of environmental documents is of great importancein ensuring environmental values are integrated in the planning and decisionprocesses. It is important to remember that next to the project itself,a properly prepared EIS will require the longest time to complete. (1) <T3>Categorical exclusions. </T3>When a proposed action is categoricallyexcluded from further environmental review (in accordance with SubpartD and Appendix A), the proponent may proceed immediately with that action.(2) <T3>Findings of no significant impact. </T3>(i) If the proposed actionis one of national concern, is unprecedented, or normally requires an EIS,the proponent will make the FNSI available for public review 30 or moredays prior to making a final decision. A news release is required to publicizethe availability of the FNSI. If the action is of national significance,a simultaneous announcement must be made by HQDA, which includes publicationin the <T4>Federal Register. </T4>(ii) Except for those proposed actions referred to in paragraph (b)(2)(i)of this section, the proponent may allow a 30-day period or other reasonableperiod for public comment between the time that the FNSI is publicized(40 CFR 1506.6(b)) and the time the proposed action begins. Include a deadlineand point of contact (POC) for receipt of comments in the FNSI and thenews release. (3) <T3>Environmental Impact Statements. </T3>(i) EPA publishes a weekly noticein the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of the EISs filed during the preceding week.(This notice usually occurs each Friday. A Notice of Availability (NOA)reaching EPA before noon on a Friday will be published in the followingFriday <T4>Federal Register</T4>. Failure to deliver a NOA to EPA by noon on Fridaywill result in an additional one week delay.) A news release publicizingthe action shall be made in conjunction with the notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. The following time periods calculated from thepublication date of the EPA notice will be observed: (A) Not less than 45 days for public comment on DEISs (40 CFR 1506.10(c)).(B) Not less than 15 days for public availability of DEISs prior to anypublic hearing on the DEIS (40 CFR 1506.10(c)(2)). (C) Not less than 90 days total for public availability of the DEIS andFEIS prior to any decision on the proposed action. These periods may runconcurrently (40 CFR 1506.10(b) and (c)). (D) The time periods prescribed in subparagraphs (b)(3)(i)(A)-(C) of thissection may be extended or reduced in accordance with 40 CFR 1506.10(b)(2)and 1506.10(d). (ii) When variations to these time limits are set, the Army agency shouldconsider the factors in 40 CFR 1501.8(b)(1). (iii) The proponent may also set time limits for other procedures or decisionsrelated to draft and FEIS's as listed in 40 CFR 1501.8(b)(2). (iv) The entire EIS process could require more than one year (See Figure3-2). This, it is important that the process begin as soon as the projectis conceptualized and that the proponent coordinate with all staff elementswho may have a role to play in the NEPA process. Most of this time is takenby the preparation of the DEIS and the revision and response to commentsto prepare the FEIS. A public affairs plan should be developed which providesfor periodic interaction with the community. There is a minimum publicreview time of 90 days between the publication of the DEIS and the announcementof the ROD. Army EISs are not normally processed in so short a time dueto the internal staffing required for this type of action. After the availabilityof the ROD is announced, the action may proceed. Figure 3-2 indicates typicaland required time periods for EISs. (c) <T3>Programmatic environmental review (tiering). </T3>(1) Army agenciesare encouraged to write programmatic environmental analyses when such programsare being considered for general application (40 CFR 1502.4(c), 1502.20and 1508.23). This will eliminate repetitive discussions of the same issuesand focus on the key issues at each appropriate level of project review.When a broad EIS or EA has been prepared and a subsequent EIS or EA isthen prepared on an action included within the entire program or policy(particularly a site-specific action), it need only summarize issues discussedin the broader statement and concentrate on the issues specific to thesubsequent action. This subsequent document shall state where the earlierdocument is available. (2) An example would be the assessment of a proposed major weapon systemprogram. Development of an overall programmatic EIS or EA for the lifecycle of the system is recommended. Tiered EAs and EISs, as appropriate,would evaluate specific subphases such as testing, production, development,use and ultimate disposal. (d) <T3>Scoping. </T3>When the planning for a Army project or action indicatesa need for an EIS preparation, the proponent initiates the scoping process(40 CFR 1501.7). This process determines the scope of issues to addressin the EIS and identifies the significant issues related to the proposedaction. During the scoping process the participants identify the rangeof actions, alternatives, and impacts to consider in the EIS (40 CFR 1508.25).For an individual action, the scope may depend on the relationship of theproposed action to other environmental documents.<ITAG tagnum="21">[<T4>Editorial note: </T4>The time relationships will be published in theFinal rule] </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">Figure 3-2 Time Relationships for Preparing and Processing an EIS </ITAG>(2) The extent of the scoping process, including public involvement, willdepend on several factors. These factors include: The size and type ofthe proposed action; whether the proposed action is of regional or nationalinterest; the degree of any associated environmental controversy; the sizeof the affected environmental parameter(s), and the significance of anyeffects on them; the extent of prior environmental review; involvementof any substantive time limits; and requirements by other laws for environmentalreview.  (3) The proponent may incorporate scoping in the public involvement orenvironmental review process other than that required for an EIS. If so,significant reduction in the extent of scoping incorporated is at the proponent'sdiscretion.  (4) Section 651.32 of this regulation discusses the procedures and actionsto be taken by a proponent during an EIS scoping process.  (e) <T3>Documentation and analyses. </T3>Environmental documentation and analysesrequired by this regulation shall be integrated as much as practicablewith other environmental reviews, laws, and executive orders (40 CFR 1502.25)and:  (1) Environmental documentation required by various state laws.  (2) Any cost-benefit analyses prepared in relation to a proposed action(40 CFR 1502.23).  (3) Permitting and licensing procedures required by Federal and State law.For instance, the Clean Air Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 57401 <T3>et seq.</T3>) and the Clean Water Act, as amended (33 U.S.C. 125 <T3>et seq.</T3>).  (4) Installation and Army Master Planning functions and plans.  (5) Installation management plans, particularly those which deal directlywith the environment. These include the Natural Resource Management Plans(Fish and Wildlife Management Plan, Forest Management Plan, Range Imrpovementor Maintenance Plan, and Historic Preservation Plan).  (6) Stationing and installation planning, force development planning, andmaterial acquisition planning.  (7) Installation Compatible Use Zone (ICUZ) program.  (8) Hazardous waste management plans.  (9) Historic Preservation Plan as required by AR 420-40.  (10) Intergovernmental Coordination as required by AR 210-10.  (11) Asbestos Management Plans.  (f) <T3>Relations with local and regional agencies. </T3>Installation, agency,or activity environmental officers or planners should establish planningrelations with other agencies. These agencies include the staffs of adjacentlocal governments and state agencies. This will promote cooperation andresolution of mutual land use and environment-related problems. Preparationof a Memorandum of Understanding is desirable for promoting cooperationand coordination. This memorandum will identify areas of mutual interest,establish points of contact, identify lines of communication between agencies,and specify procedures to follow in conflict resolution. Additional coordinationis available from state and area-wide planning and development agencies,including those designated by AR-210-10. Thus, the proponent may gain insightson other agencies' approaches to environmental assessments, surveys, andstudies of the current proposal. These other agencies would also be ableto assist in identifying possible participants in scoping procedures forprojects requiring an EIS.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 651.13 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Mitigation and monitoring.  </ITAG>(a) <T3>Identification in environmental documents. </T3>Only those mitigationmeasures which can reasonably be accomplished as part of a proposed alternativeshall be identified in environmental documentation (EA, FNSI, or EIS).Measures which the proponent will implement as part of the selected actionwill be included in the environmental documentation. Mitigation measureswhich appear practicable but unobtainable within expected resources, orwhich some other agency (including non-Army agencies) should perform, shallbe identified as such in the environmental document. ``Practicable'' measuresinclude, among others, actions which appear capable of being accomplished.Complete development or testing of the exact means of performing the actionmay not have occurred.  (b) <T3>Consideration throughout the NEPA process. </T3>Consider mitigationthroughout the NEPA process. When an EIS or EIS Supplement is prepared,the ROD will state specific mitigation measures taken to reduce or avoidthe selected action's adverse environmental effects. For EAs, the FNSIwill state, when applicable, the appropriate mitigation measures to beimplemented. Such mitigation measures shall become a project line itemin the proposal budget. In addition, the FNSI will state those practicablemitigation measures which have not been adopted (40 CFR 1505.2(c).  (c) <T3>Assistance from cooperating non-Army agencies. </T3>Proponents mayrequest assistance with mitigation when appropriate. Whether it is appropriateto request assistance is determined by whether the requested agency:  (1) Was a cooperating agency during preparation of an environmental document,or  (2) Has the technology, expertise, time, funds, or familiarity with proejector local ecology necessary to implement the mitigation measure more effectivelythan the lead agency.  (d) <T3>Implementing the decision. </T3>(1) The proponent agency or other appropriatecooperating agency will implement mitigation and other conditions establishedin the EA/EIS or during its review, and committed as part of the FNSI orthe ROD.  (2) Legal documents implementing the action (contracts, permits, grants,etc.) will specify mitigation measures to be performed. Penalties for noncompliancemay also be specified as appropriate. Specification of penalties shouldbe fully coordinated with the appropriate legal advisor.  (3) A monitoring and enforcement program shall be adopted and summarizedin the ROD where applicable for any mitigation. (See Appendix D for guidelineson implementing such a program.) Whether adoption of a monitoring and enforcementprogram is ``applicable'' (40 CFR 1505.2(c)) and whether the specific adoptedaction is an ``important'' case (40 CFR 1505.3) may depend on such factorsas the following:  (i) A change in environmental conditions or project activities assumedin the EIS (such that original predictions of the extent of adverse environmentalimpacts may be too limited).  (ii) Cases in which the outcome of the mitigation measure is uncertain(e.g., new technology).  (iii) Projects in which major environmental controversy remains associatedwith the selected alternative.  (iv) Cases in which failure of a mitigation measure, or other unforeseencircumstances, could result in serious harm to Federal or State listedendangered or threatened species; important historic or archaeologicalsites that are either on, or meet eligibility requirements for nominationto, the National Register of Historic Places; wilderness areas, wild andscenic rivers, or other public or private protected resources (make theevaluation of serious harm in coordination with the appropriate Federal,State or local agency responsible for each particular program).  (v) The proponent shall respond to inquiries from the public or other agenciesregarding the status of mitigation measures adopted.<ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart D_Categorical Exclusions </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 651.14 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Purpose and definition. </ITAG>The use of Categorical Exclusions (CX) is intended to reduce paperworkand delay, and eliminate unnecessary EA/EIS preparation.

These circumstances include: (1) Greater scope or size than normally experienced for a particular categoryof action. (2) Potential for degradation, even though slight, of already existingpoor environmental conditions. Also, initiation of a degrading influence,activity, or effect in areas not already significantly modified from theirnatural condition. (3) Employment of unproven technology. (4) Presence of threatened or endangered species and their habitats, archaeologicalmaterials, historical places, or other protected resources. (5) Use of hazardous or toxic substances which may come in contact withthe surrounding natural environment. Nevertheless, a categorical exclusionexists for use of hazardous and toxic substances under adequately controlledconditions within established laboratory buildings which are designed for,and in compliance with, regulatory standards. Adequately controlled conditionsincludes complying with AR 385-10 (The Army Safety Program) for the processingof hazardous and toxic substances, and compling with the Resource Conservationand Recovery Act (RCRA) for their disposal. (6) Proposed actions affecting areas of critical environmental concern.These include, but are not limited to, prime or unique agricultural lands,wetlands, coastal zones, wilderness areas, aquifers, floodplains, or wildand scenic river areas. (c) Determine whether all the screening questions in Appendix A can beanswered affirmatively. (d) If the proposed action qualifies for one of the categorical exclusions,nothing more is necessary. However, if the exclusion requires a Recordof Environmental Consideration (Figure 2-1), a REC shall be completed andsigned by the proponent. Consultation between the proponent and the InstallationEnvironmental Coordinator is required. If Categorical Exclusion A-28 isused, the signature of the Office of the Staff Judge Advocate (local orcommand, as appropriate) is required. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 651.17 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Categorical exclusions. </ITAG>Types of actions which normally qualify for categorical exclusion are listedin Appendix A. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 651.18 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Modification of the list of categorical exclusions. </ITAG>The Army list of CXs is subject to continual review and modification.

Forward the NOI and the proposed press release to theARSTAF proponent for <T4>Federal Register</T4> publication. The ARSTAF proponent will coordinatethe NOI with HQDA (CEHSC-E, OCLL, and OCPA). A cover letter similar toFigure 6-2 shall accompany the NOI. An example NOI is at Figure 6-3. TheNOI initiates the scoping process. Therefore, provide adequate responsetime for those wishing to comment on the NOI or participate in the scopingprocess. Subpart G discusses public participation requirements and options.(b) <T3>Lead and cooperating agency determination</T3>. As soon as possibleafter the decision is made to prepare an EIS, the proponent, if necessary,will contact appropriate Federal, State and local agencies to identifylead or cooperating agency responsibilities concerning EIS preparation(40 CFR 1501.5). At this point, a public affairs plan must also be developed.(c) <T3>Scoping</T3>. If determined that Army is the lead agency, the proponentwill begin the scoping process decribed in 651.32a. Portions of the scopingprocess may take place prior to publication of the NOI.(d) <T3>Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) preparation and processing.</T3>(1) <T3>Preliminary DEIS.</T3> Based on information obtained and decisionsmade during the scoping process, the proponent will prepare the preliminaryDEIS. Forward 15 copies for ARSTAF review. The preliminary DEIS will becirculated by the proponent office to OASA (Iandamp;L), OACE, OTJAG, OTSG,OCPA, and other interested offices for review and comment. The preliminaryDEIS is then returned to the preparer for revision as required, and printingof the DEIS for filing.(2) <T3>DEIS.</T3> The Army proponent will advise the DEIS preparer of thenumber of copies to be forwarded for final ARSTAF review, and those forfiling with EPA. Distribution may include interested Congressional delegationsand committees, governors, national environmental organizations, the DODand Federal agency headquarters, and other selected entities. The Armyproponent will prepare the <T4>Federal Register</T4> Notice of Availability, the proposed news release,and the EPA filing letter for the signature of the Deputy for Environment,Safety, and Occupational Health (DESOH), OASA (Iandamp;L). When the DEIShas been formally approved by HQDA, and the NOA has been published in the<T4>Federal Register,</T4> the HQDA staff proponent will notify the preparerto distribute the DEIS to the remainder of the distribution list. The listincludes Federal, State, regional, and local agencies, private citizens,and local organizations.(e) <T3>Public review of DEIS.</T3> (1) The length of the DEIS public commentperiod will normally be no less than 45 days from publication of the Noticeof Availability in the Federal Register. If the statement is unusuallylong, circulate a summary with an attached list of locations where reviewof the entire DEIS may take place, (e.g., local public libraries). However,EIS distribution must include: (i) Any federal agency which has jurisdictionby law or special expertise with respect to any environmental impact involvedand any appropriate Federal, State, or local agency authorized to developand enforce environmental standards.(ii) The applicant, if any.(iii) Any person, organization, or agency requesting the entire environmentalimpact statement.(iv) In the case of a final environmental impact statement, any person,organization, or agency which submitted substantive comments on the DEIS.(2) Hold public meetings or hearings on the DEIS in accordance with thecriteria established in 40 CFR 1506.6(c) and (d) or for any other reasonthe proponent deems appropriate. News releases should be prepared and issuedto publicize the meetings or hearings.(f) <T3>Response to comments.</T3> Incorporate responses to comments in theDEIS by modification of the text and/or written explanation. Where possible,group similar comments for a common response. The preparer or a higherauthority may make individual response, if considered desirable.(g) <T3>Prepare Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS).</T3> If the changesin the DEIS are exclusively factual corrections, prepare and circulateonly an errata sheet containing DEIS comments, responses, and changes.Nevertheless, the entire document and new cover sheet will be filed withEPA (40 CFR 1503.4(c)). If broader modifications are necessary, the proponentwill prepare a preliminary FEIS incorporating these modifications. Processingthe FEIS is essentially the same as the process outlined for the DEIS transmittal.However, there is no need to invite public comment during the 30 day post-filingwaiting period (40 CFR 1503.1(b)).(h) <T3>Decision.</T3> Make no decision on a proposed action until 30 daysafter EPA has published the NOA in the <T4>Federal Register.</T4> EPA publishes NOAs weekly. Those NOAs readyfor EPA by Friday noon are published in the next Friday's <T4>Federal Register.</T4>(i) <T3>Record of Decision (ROD).</T3> At the time of decision, or, if appropriate,its recommendation to Congress, the decisionmaker staff will prepare aROD (40 CFR 1505.2, and 1505.3). This will become a part of the environmentaldocumentation presented for the final decision. Forward a copy of the signedROD to the Army Environmental Office. The ROD shall:(1) State what the decision was.(2) Identify all alternatives considered by the Army in reaching its decision,specifying the alternative or alternatives which were considered to beenvironmentally preferable. The Army may discuss preferences among alternativesbased on relevant factors including economic and technical considerationsand agency statutory missions. The ROD shall identify and discuss all suchfactors, including any essential considerations of national policy whichwere balanced by the Army in making its decision. Because economic andtechnical analysis are balanced with environmental analysis, the agencypreferred alternative will not necessarily be the environmentally preferredalternative. The ROD shall state how those considerations entered intothe final decision.(3) State whether all practicable means to avoid or minimize environmentalharm from the selected alternative have been adopted, and if not, why theywere not. A monitoring and enforcement program shall be adopted and summarizedfor any mitigation. (Also see Appendix D.)(j) <T3>Pre-decision referrals.</T3> 40 CFR Part 1504 specifies proceduresto resolve Federal agency disagreements on the environmental effects ofa proposed action. Pre-decision referrals apply to interagency disagreementon a proposed action's potential unsatisfactory effects.(k) <T3>Changes during preparation.</T3> If there are substantial changes inthe proposed action, or significant new information relevant to environmentalconcerns, during the proposed action's planning process, the proponentshall prepare revisions or a supplement to any environmental document orprepare new documentation as necessary.(l) <T3>Mitigation.</T3> All measures planned to minimize or mitigate expectedsignificant environmental impacts shall be identified in the EIS. Implementationof the mitigation plan is the responsibility of the proponent (see AppendixD). The proponent will make available to the public, upon request, thestatus and results of mitigation measures associated with the proposedaction.(m) <T3>Implementing the decision.</T3> The Army may provide for monitoringto assure that its decisions are carried out and should do so in controversialcases or environmentally sensitive areas (see Appendix D). Mitigation andother conditions established in the EIS or during its review, and commentas part of the decision, shall be implemented by the lead agency or otherappropriate consenting agency. The proponent shall:(1) Include appropriate conditions in grants, permits or other approvals.(2) Condition funding of actions on mitigation.(3) Upon request, inform cooperating or commenting agencies on the progressin carrying out adopted mitigation measures which they have proposed andwhich were adopted by the agency making the decision.(4) Upon request, make the results of relevant monitoring available tothe public and Congress.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 3710-08-M001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration 2514</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 3710-08-C</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Director,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26"><T3>Office of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Service,1100 L Street NW., Washington, DC 20408.</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dear sir: The attached Notice of Intent is submitted for publicationin the Notice Section of the Federal Register.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Please publish this Notice of Intent in the earliest edition of theFederal Register possible.

This can be accomplished bydeveloping a plan to address these requirements at the very beginning ofthe documentation process. (See also AR 360-5.) The plan shall includethe following:(1) Disseminate information to the local and installation communities throughvarious means (e.g., news releases to local media, announcements to localcitizens groups, Commander's letters) at each phase or milestone (morefrequently if needed) of the project. Such information may be subject toFreedom of Information Act (FOIA) and Operations Security (OPSEC) review.(2) Coordinate each phase or milestone (more frequently if needed) of theproject with representatives of local, state, and Federal government agencies.(3) Invite public comments and keep two-way communication channels openthrough various means as stated above.(4) Keep Public Affairs Officers at all levels informed.(b) When an EIS is being prepared, public involvement is a requisite elementof the scoping process (40 CFR 1501.7(a)(1).(c) Preparation of EAs shall incorporate public involvement processes wheneverappropriate (40 CFR 1506.6).(d) Persons and agencies to be consulted include:(1) Municipal, township, and county elected and appointed officials.(2) State, county, and local government officials and administrative personnelwhose official duties include responsibility for activities or componentsof the affected environment related to the proposed Army action.(3) Local and regional administrators of other Federal agencies or commissionswhich may either control resources potentially affected by the proposedaction (e.g., Fish and Wildlife Service) or who may be aware of other actionsby different Federal agencies whose effects must be considered with theproposed Army action (e.g., General Services Administration).(4) The members of identifiable population segments within the potentiallyaffected environments, whether or not they have clearly identifiable leadersor an established organization (e.g., farmers and ranchers, homeowners,small business owners, Indian tribes).(5) Members and officials of those identifiable interest groups of localor national scope which may have interest in the environmental effectsof the proposed action or activity (e.g., hunters and fishermen, IsaakWalton League, Sierra Club, Audubon society).(6) Any person or group which has specifically requested involvement inthe specific action or similar actions.(e) The public involvement processes and procedures by which participationmay be solicited include the following:(1) Direct individual contact_identifies persons expected to express anopinion and participate in later public meetings.

The proponent will:(a) Develop a draft scope for the EIS which identifies issues to be analyzed.(b) Identify the office or person(s) responsible for matters related tothe scoping process. If these office(s) or person(s) are not the same asthe proponent of the action, make that distinction.(c) Identify the lead and cooperating agency, if already determined (40CFR 1501.5-6). (d) Identify the method by which the agency will invite participation ofaffected parties. Also, the proponent may identify a tentative list ofthe affected parties to be notified. (e) Identify the proposed method for accomplishing the scoping procedure.(f) Indicate the relationship between the timing of the preparation ofenvironmental analyses and the proponent's tentative planning and decision-makingschedule including: (1) The scoping process itself; (2) Collecting or analyzing environmental data, including studies requiredof cooperating agencies; (3) Preparation of DEISs and final FEISs; (4) Filing of the ROD; (5) Taking the action; and (6) For a programmatic EIS, preparing a general expected schedule for futurespecific implementing actions which will involve separate environmentalanalysis. (g) If applicable, identify the extent to which the EIS preparation processis exempt from any of the normal procedural requirements of this regulation,including scoping. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 651.33b </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Scoping_Public interaction phase. </ITAG>(a) During this portion of the process, the proponent will invite commentsfrom all affected parties and respondents to the NOI to assist in developmentof issues for detailed discussion in the EIS. Assistance in identifyingpossible participants is available from the Army Environmental Office.(b) In addition to the affected parties identified above, participantsshould include the following: (1) Technical representatives of the proponent. Such persons must be ableto describe for other participants the technical aspects of the proposedaction and alternatives. (2) One or more representatives of any Army-contracted consulting firm(s),if one has been retained to participate in writing the EIS or providingreports which the Army will directly use to create substantial portionsof the EIS. (3) Experts in various environmental disciplines, if any area where impactsare foreseen is not already represented among the other scoping participants.(c) In all cases, provide the participants with the information developedduring the preliminary phase and as much of the following information asmay be available: (1) A brief description of the environment at the affected location. Whendescriptions for a specific location are not available use general descriptionsof the probable environmental effect. Also include the extent to whichthe environment has been modified or affected in the past. (2) A description of the proposed alternatives. The description will besufficiently detailed to enable evaluation of the range of impacts whichmay be caused by the proposed action and alternatives. The amount of detailthat is sufficient will depend on the stage of the development of the proposal,its magnitude, and its similarity to other actions with which participantsmay be familiar. (3) A tentative identification of: ``*** any public environmental assessmentsand other environmental impact statements which are being or will be preparedthat are related to but are not part of the scope of the impact statementunder consideration'' (40 CFR 1501.7(a)(5)). (4) Any additional scoping issues or limitations on the EIS, if not alreadydescribed during the preliminary phase. (d) The public involvement may begin with the Notice of Intent to publishan EIS. The NOI may indicate when and where a scoping meeting will takeplace and whom to contact to receive preliminary information. The purposeof the scoping meeting is to be an informal public meeting. It is a workingsession where the gathering and evaluation of information relating to potentialenvironmental impacts can proceed. (e) Starting with the above information, the person conducting the scopingprocess will use input from any of the involved or affected parties. Thiswill aid in developing the conclusions. The proponent determines the finalscope of the EIS. If the proponent chooses not to require detailed treatmentof significant issues or factors in the EIS, in spite of relevant technicalor scientific objections by any participant to the contrary, the proponentwill clearly identify (in the Environmental Consequences section of theEIS) the criteria which were used to eliminate such factors from detailedconsideration. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 651.33c </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Scoping_The final phase. </ITAG>(a) The scope used in the preparation of DEIS consists of the determinationsmade by the proponent during and after the public interaction phase ofthe process, as follows: (1) The scope and the significant issues for detailed analysis in the EIS(40 CFR 1501.7(a)(2)). To determine the scope of EISs, the proponent willconsider three types of actions, three types of alternatives, and threetypes of impacts. (i) The three actions (other than unconnected single actions) include:(A) Connected actions, which means that they are closely related and thereforeshould be discussed in the same impact statement. Actions are connectedif they: Automatically trigger other actions which may require EISs; cannotor will not proceed unless other actions are taken previously or simultaneously;are interdependent parts of a larger action and depend on the larger actionfor their justification. (B) Cumulative actions, when viewed with other proposed actions, have cumulativelysignificant impacts and should therefore be discussed in the same impactstatement. (C) Similar actions, which have similarities that provide a basis for evaluatingtheir environmental consequences together, such as common timing or geography.An agency may wish to analyze these actions in the EIS. It should do sowhen the best way to assess such actions is to treat them in a single EIS.(ii) The three alternatives are:(A) No action;(B) Other reasonable courses of action;(C) Mitigation measures (not in the proposed action).(iii) The three types of impacts include:(A) Direct;(B) Indirect;(C) Cumulative.(2) Identification and elimination from detailed study of issues whichare not significant or which have been covered by prior environmental review.This narrows the discussion of these issues to a brief presentation ofwhy they will not have a significant effect on the human environment. Itmay also provide a reference to their coverage elsewhere (40 CFR 1501.7(a)(3)).(3) Allocation of assignments for preparation of the EIS among the leadand any cooperating agencies, with the lead agency retaining responsibilityfor the statement (40 CFR 1501.7(a)(4)).(4) Indication of any public EAs and other EISs, prepared by the Army oranother Federal agency, related to, but not part of, the EIS under consideration(40 CFR 1501.7(a)(5)).(5) Identification of any other environmental review and consultation requirementsso the lead and cooperating agencies may prepare other required analysesand studies concurrently with the EIS (40 CFR 1501.7(a)(6)).(b) As part of the scoping process the lead agency may:(1) Set time limits, as provided in andSection; 651.11(b), if they were notalready indicated in the preliminary phase.(2) Prescribe overall page limits to the EIS in accordance with the CEQregulations which emphasize conciseness.(c) All determinations reached by the proponent during the scoping processwill be clearly conveyed to the preparers of the EIS in a Scope of Statement.The Scope of Statement shall be made available to participants in the scopingprocess and to other interested parties on request. Any conflicts on issuesof a scientific or technical nature which arise between the proponent andscoping participants, cooperating agencies, other Federal agencies, orthe preparers of the document, will be identified during the scoping process,and will be resolved or discussed by the proponent in the draft EIS.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 651.33d</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Aids to information gathering.</ITAG>The proponent may use or develop graphic or other innovative methods toaid information gathering, presentation, and transfer during the threescoping phases. These include methods for presenting preliminary informationto scoping participants, obtaining and consolidating input from participants,and organizing its own determinations on scope for use during preparationof the DEIS.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 651.33e</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Modifications of the scoping process.</ITAG>(a) If there is a lengthy period between a decision to prepare an EIS andthe time of preparation, the proponent will initiate the NOI at a reasonabletime in advance of preparation of the DEIS. The NOI shall state any tentativeconclusions regarding the scope of the EIS made prior to publication ofthe NOI. Allow reasonable time for public participation before the proponentmakes any final decisions or commitments on the EIS.(b) The proponent of a proposed action may use scoping during preparationof environmental review documents other than EIS, if desired. The proponentmay use the above procedures, or may develop modified procedures at his/herdiscretion.<ITAG tagnum="56">Subpart H_Environmental Effects of Major Army Actions Abroad</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 651.34</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">General.</ITAG>Protection of the environment is an Army priority, no matter where theinstallation is located.

An examination of each specificproposal in clear terms is required. This section should be written insimple, non-technical language for the lay reader. A ``no action'' alternativewill be included (40 CFR 1502.14(d)). For actions other than construction,the term ``no action'' is often misleading because a continuation of thestatus quo is implicit. Required in this section is an examination of thestatus quo. A preferred alternative need not be identified in the DEIS;however, a preferred alternative generally must be included in the FEIS(40 CFR 1502.14(e)).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A simple title or a letter or number symbol may be used for each ofthe discussed alternatives (e.g., ``alternative A'').

A description of the mitigation measures nominated for incorporationinto the proposed action and alternatives, as well as mitigation measuresavailable but not incorporated.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d. Listing of any alternatives that were eliminated from detailedstudy. Briefly discuss the reasons for which each alternative was eliminated.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">6. <T3>Affected Environment(s). </T3>This section will contain informationabout existing conditions in the affected area(s) necessary to understandthe potential effects of the alternatives under consideration (40 CFR 1502.15).Environments created by the implemented proposal will be included as appropriate.Affected elements could include, for example, biophysical characteristics(ecology, water quality); land use and land use plans; architectural, historical,and cultural amenities; utilities and services; and transportation. Thissection will not be encyclopedic. It will be written clearly and the degreeof detail for all points covered will be related to the significance andmagnitude of expected impacts. Elements not impacted by any of the alternativesneed only be presented in summary form or referenced.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">7. <T3>Environmental and Socio-Economic Consequences. </T3>This section ofthe EIS forms the scientific and analytic basis for the summary comparisonof effects in Part 5. The following will be discussed (40 CFR 1502.16):</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. Direct Effects and Their Significance. Include in the discussionthe direct impacts on human health and welfare and on other forms of lifeand related ecosystems. Examples of direct effect might include noise frommilitary helicopter operations or the benefits derived from the installationof wet scrubbers to meet air quality control standards.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. Indirect Effects and Their Significance. Include here socio-economicimpacts. Many Federal actions attract people to previously unpopulatedareas and indirectly induce pollution, traffic congestion, and haphazardland environment. Conversely, other actions may disperse the existing population.Aircraft noise often affects future development patterns, and air pollutionabatement operations may result in secondary water pollution problems.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. Possible conflicts between the proposed actions and Federal, regional,state, and local (including Indian Tribe) land use plans, policies, andcontrols for the area(s) concerned. Compare the land use aspects of theproposed action, and discuss possible conflicts, such as siting an extremelynoise activity adjacent to a residential area, leasing land for purposesinconsistent with state wildlife management, or creating conflicts withprime and unique farm land policies.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d. The environmental effects of alternatives, including the proposedaction.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Impacts of the alternatives, including a worst case analysis wherethere are gaps in relevent information or scientific uncertainty.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Adverse environmental effects which cannot be avoided should theproposal be implemented. Include the relationship between short-term usesof the human environment and the maintenance and enhancement of long-termproductivity. The section should discuss the extent to which the proposedaction and its alternatives involve short-term vs. long-term environmentalgains and losses. In this context, short-term and long-term do not referto any rigid time period and should be viewed in terms of the environmentallysignificant consequences of the proposed action. Thus, ``short-term'' canrange from a very short period of time during which an action takes placeto the expected life of a facility.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">e. Energy Requirements and Conservation Potential of Various Alternativesand Mitigation Measures. Consult the Energy Resource Impact Statement (AR11-27), when applicable, to satisfy this requirement. Account for the energyconsumption of each proposed alternative and associated economics. Discuss,where appropriate, the uses of renewable and nonrenewable energy resources.A discussion of conservation techniques which could attenuate energy consumptionshould also be discussed within this section_for example, the use of insultationfor newly constructed family housing which would reduce the long-term consumptionof fuel oil or natural gas.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">f. Natural or Depletable Resource Requirements and Conservation Potentialof Various Mitigation Measures.

The intention of mitigationis to reduce the effects of the action on the environment. The followingsections discuss the five means of mitigation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ From: John Fittipaldi, et al., Handbook for EnvironmentalImpact Analysis and Planning, Technical Report N-130, U.S. Army ConstructionEngineering Research Laboratory (CERL), October 1982, pp 133-143.<ITAG tagnum="21">a. <T3>Avoidance. </T3>This method avoids enviornmental impact by not performingcertain activities, e.g., allowing tracked vehicles to cross only at designatedimproved stream crossings. This would reduce the effects on a stream resultingfrom random access, such as increased turbidity caused by bank erosionand bottom disturbance caused by the tracks.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. <T3>Limitation of action. </T3>The extent of an impact can be reduced bylimiting the degree or magnitude of the action (e.g., changing the firingtime or the number of rounds fired on artillery ranges to reduce the noiseimpact on nearby residents). In the example given in paragraph 1a above,the number of authorized stream crossings would have been limited or minimized.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. <T3>Restoration of the environment. </T3>This method restores the environmentto its previous condition or better. Movement of troops and vehicles acrossvegetated areas often destroys vegetation. This impact can be mitigatedby either reseeding or replanting the areas with native plants after theexercise.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d. <T3>Preservation and maintenance operations. </T3>This method designs theaction so as to reduce adverse environmental effects. Examples includingmaintaining erosion control structures, using air pollution control devices,and encouraging car pools in order to reduce transportation effects suchas air pollution, energy consumption, and traffic congestion.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">e. <T3>Replacement. </T3>This method replaces the resource or environmentthat will be impacted by the action. Replacement can occur in-kind or otherwise(e.g., replace deer habitat in the project area with deer habitat in anotherarea; or, replace fisheries habitat with deer habitat.) This replacementcan occur either on the site or impact or at another location. This typeof mitigation is often used in water resources projects. For example, ifan action were destroying some of the installation's best deer habitat,a potential mitigation would be developing another section of the installationinto deer habitat. This is an example of an in-kind replacement at a differentsite.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. <T3>Identification of Mitigation Techniques. </T3>Identifying and evaluatingmitigation techniques involves using experts familiar with the predictedenvironmental impacts. A single mitigation measure will often alleviateseveral different impacts.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. <T3>Sources of information. </T3>There are many potential sources of informationconcerning the mitigation of various environmental effects.

Urban, et al., Computer-Aided Environmental ImpactAnalysis for Construction Activities: User Manual, Technical Report E-50/ADA008988(CERL, March 1975).<ITAG tagnum="21">b. <T3>Example mitigation techniques. </T3>Several different mitigation techniqueshave been used on military installations for a number of years. The followingexamples illustrate the variety of possible measures. There are maneuverrestrictions in areas used extensively for tracked vehicle training. Theserestrictions are not designed to infringe on the military mission, butrather to reduce the amount of damage to the training area. Aerial seedinghas been done on some installations to reduce erosion problems. Changingthe time and/or frequency of operations has been used. This may involvechanging the season of the year, the time of day, or even day of the weekfor various activities. This avoids noise impacts as well as aesthetic,transportation, and some ecological problems. Reducing the effects of constructionhas involved using techniques that keep heavy equipment away from protectedtrees and quickly reseeding areas after construction.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. <T3>Mitigation alternatives. </T3>Army regulations require considerationof all practical mitigation alternatives. The emphasis is not on what canbe theoretically accomplished, but on mitigations that can and will beattempted for each alternative.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Practical mitigations are those that the proponent can accomplishwithin the project's constraints, e.g., manpower and money. Definitionof practical measures must be at the installation level; what may be practicalon one post or at one time may not be practical on another. A number ofitems determine what is practical, including military mission, manpowerrestrictions, cost, institutional barriers, technical feasibility, andpublic acceptance. Practicality does not necessarily insure that therewill be no conflict among these items; it is rather the degree of conflictwhich determines practicality.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) All of the previous examples involved some amount of conflictin all of these areas. Although mission conflicts are inevitable, theyare not insurmountable; therefore, the proponent should be cautious aboutdeclaring all mitigations impracticable and carefully consider any manpowerrequirements. This may be a greater restriction than military mission conflicts.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) There is no standard ``rule of thumb'' applicable to mitigationactivities. The key point concerning both the manpower and cost constraintsis that unless money is actually budgeted and manpower assigned, the mitigationdoes not exist. This will require coordination by the proponent officeearly in the process to allow enough time to get the mitigation activitiesinto the budget cycle. If the mitigation is not funded on schedule withthe action, the action can be judically stopped.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) Mitigations that do not fall directly within the definition of``practical'' must still be considered, including those to be accomplishedby other agencies. The proponent must coordinate with these agencies sothat they can plan to obtain the necessary manpower and funds. Mitigationsthat were considered but rejected must be discussed, along with the reasonfor the rejection, within the EIS.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. <T3>Monitoring. </T3>Monitoring is a way to examine an environmental mitigation.There are two basic types of monitoring: enforcing performance, and notinghow effectively the mitigation reduces the environmental impact.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. <T3>Enforcement monitoring. </T3>Enforcement monitoring insures that themitigation is being performed as described in the environmental document.This includes making sure that mitigation requirements and penalty clausesare written into any necessary contracts. It also means making sure thatthese provisions are enforced. Any on-post mitigation must be budgetedfor, scheduled, and any necessary manpower assigned before it can be considereda mitigation. Any changes required in post regulations must be completedand enforced. The actual mitigation (for example, aerial seeding of a trainingarea) must be performed. Enforcement monitoring involves the monitoringof all these activities.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. <T3>Effectiveness monitoring. </T3>Effectiveness monitoring measures thesuccess of the mitigation effort and/or the environmental effect. Thismust be a scientifically based quantitative investigation. Generally, qualitativemeasurements are not acceptable. By the same token, it is not necessaryto measure everything that may be affected by the action; it is only necessaryto obtain enough information to judge the method's effectiveness.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. <T3>Establishing a Monitoring System. </T3>Monitoring is an integral partof any mitigation system. Establishment of a monitoring system must involveall offices which will be involved in its implementation. When evaluatingseveral different potential monitoring systems, the ability to performthe monitoring is the most critical factor. This means that manpower_bothon-post and outside expertise_must be available. Sufficient funds mustalso be available for the monitoring process. Figures D-1 through D-3 illustratethe steps in establishing a monitoring system. Figure D-1 is designed tohelp select the type of monitoring system needed. Figure D-2 shows theresponsibilities of the lead agency in establishing an enforcement monitoringprogram. Figure D-3 illustrates the steps necessary to establish an effectivenessmonitoring program.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">5. <T3>Type of Monitoring Program. </T3>AR 200-1 and other laws and regulationshelp determine the type of monitoring program needed. There are five basicconsiderations (figure D-1).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. <T3>Legal requirements. </T3>Permits for some actions will require thata monitoring system be established (e.g., dredge and fill permits fromthe Corps of Engineers). These will generally require both enforcementand effectiveness monitoring programs.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. <T3>Protected resources. </T3>These include Federal- or State-listed endangeredor threatened species, important historic or archaeological sites (whetheror not these are included on the National Register of Historic Places),wilderness areas, wild and scenic rivers, and other public or private protectedresources. Private protected resources include areas such as Audubon SocietyRefuges, Nature Conservancy lands, or any other land that would be protectedby law, if it were under government ownership, but is privately owned.If any of these resources are affected, an effectiveness and enforcementmonitoring program must be undertaken in conjunction with the Federal,State, or local agency which manages that type of resource.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. <T3>Major environmental controversy. </T3>If there is still controversyabout the effect of an action or the effectiveness of a mitigation, anenforcement and effectiveness monitoring program must be undertaken. Controversymeans not only scientific disagreement about the mitigation's effectiveness,but also public interest or debate.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d. <T3>Mitigation outcome. </T3>The probability of the mitigation's successmust be carefully considered. The proponent must know if the mitigationhas been successful elsewhere. The validity of the outcome should be confirmedby expert opinion. However, the proponent should note that a certain technique,such as artificial seeding with the natural vegetation, which may haveworked successfully in one area, may not work in another.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">e. <T3>Changed conditions. </T3>The final consideration is whether any conditions,such as the environmental setting, have changed (e.g., a change in localland use around the area, or a change in project activities, such as increasedamount of acreage involved or an increased number of troops being moved).Such changes will require preparation of a supplemental impact evaluationand additional monitoring. If none of these conditions are met (i.e., requirementby law, protected resources, no major controversy is involved, effectivenessof the mitigation is known, and the environmental or project conditionshave not changed), then only an enforcement monitoring program is needed.Otherwise, both an enforcement and effectiveness monitoring program willbe required.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">6. <T3>Enforcement Monitoring Program Development. </T3>The development ofan enforcement monitoring program is governed by who will actually performthe mitigation (figure D-2). Three different groups may actually performthe work: a contractor, a cooperating agency, or a lead agency (in-house).However, the lead agency is ultimately responsible for performing any mitigationactivities.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. <T3>Contract performance. </T3>Several provisions must be made in workto be performed by contract. The lead agency must insure that contractprovisions include the performance of the mitigation activity and thatpenalty clauses are written into the contracts. It must provide for timelyinspection of the mitigation measures and is responsible for enforcingall contract provision.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. <T3>Cooperating agency performance. </T3>The lead agency must insure thatif a cooperating agency performs the work, it understands its role in themitigation. The lead agency must determine and agree upon how the mitigationmeasures will be funded. It must also insure that any necessary formalpaperwork, such as cooperating agreements, is complete.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. <T3>Lead agency performance. </T3>If the lead agency performs the mitigation,the proponent has several responsibilities: insuring responsibilities neededto perform the task; providing appropriate funding in the project budget;making arrangements for necessary manpower allocations; and making anynecessary changes in the agency (installation) regulations (e.g., environmentalor range regulations).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d. <T3>Results. </T3>In any case, whether the mitigation is performed by contract,by a cooperating agency, or by the lead agency, all results will be sentto the Public Affairs Office and the Environmental Office on post.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">7. <T3>Effectiveness Monitoring Program Development. </T3>Effectiveness monitoringis the most difficult to establish (figure D-3). The responsible agent(e.g., the Director of Training) should coordinate this with the EnvironmentalOffice.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. <T3>Determination of what is to be monitored. </T3>The first step in thistype of monitoring program is to determine what must be monitored. Thisdetermination should be based on criteria discussed during the establishmentof the system (i.e., the legal requirements, protected resources, areaof controversy, known effectiveness, or changed conditions). Initially,this can be a very broad statement, such as reduction of impacts on a particularstream by a combination of replanting, erosion control devices, and rangeregulations. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. <T3>Finding expertise. </T3>The next step is finding the expertise necessaryto establish the monitoring system. The expertise may be available on-post;table D-1 lists potential sources on a military installation. If it isnot available, it must be obtained from an outside source. Directoriessuch as CERL Technial Report N-40 \5\<NOTE/> may provide the needed information. In addition, local universitiesmay have specialists and local interest groups who can identify expertswithin a particular field. This may be particularly helpful if a mitigationis considered controversial. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ R. Lacey, et al., Compendium of Administrators of LandUse and Related Programs, Technical Report N-40/ADA057226 (CERL, 1978).<ITAG tagnum="21">c. <T3>Establishment of a program. </T3>After a source of expertise is located,the program can be established, using five technical criteria. First, anyparameters used must be measurable; i.e., the monitor must be quantitative,and it must be statistically sound. Second, a baseline study must be completedbefore the monitoring begins in order to identify the actual state of thesystem prior to any distrubance. Third, the monitoring system must havea control, so that it can isolate the effects of the mitigation proceduresfrom effects originating outside the action. Fourth, the system's parametersand means of measuring them must be replicable. Finally, parameter resultsmust be available in a timely manner so that the decision-maker can takeany necessary corrective action before the effects are irreversible. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d. <T3>Program management. </T3>There are several program management considerations.First, not every mitigation has to be monitored separately. The effectivenessof several mitigation actions can be determined by one measurable parameter.For example, the turbidity measurement from a stream can include the combinedeffectiveness of mitigation actions such as reseeding, maneuver restrictions,and erosion control devices. However, if a method combines several parametersand a critical change is noted, each mitigation measurement must be examinedto determine the problem. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">e. <T3>Initiation of program. </T3>The next step is initiating the monitoringprogram. In most cases, a monitor should be established well before theaction begins, particularly when biological variables are being measuredand investigated. At this stage, any necessary contracts, funding, andmanpower assignments must be initiated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">f. <T3>Sample collection, data analysis, and coordination. </T3>The next stepin the monitoring program is sample collection and data analysis. A nontechnicalsummary of the data analaysis should be provided to the Public AffairsOffice, which will handle routine information requests related to the program.Technical results from the anlaysis should be sent to the installationEnvironmental Office, which will coordinate them with the proponent. Otherrelated coordination with concerned publics and other agencies, as arrangedthrough development of the mitigation plan, will be handled through theEnvironmental Office. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">g. <T3>Continuation of program. </T3>If the mitigations are effective, themonitoring should be continued. However, even if a noneffective resultis obtained, a nontechnical summary should still be sent to the PublicAffairs Office. The Environmental Office and the responsible group shouldreexamine the mitigation measures with the experts. The program may beeither inadequacy of the mitigation measure, in how it is being performed,or in the monitoring. Once the problem is identified, the responsible groupand the experts should determine whether more detailed information is needed,whether the monitoring is being implemented incorrectly, or whether themitigation is inadequate. After the program is resolved, the group mustdetermine whether a different monitoring system should be established.If the old program is adequate, it should simply be continued; however,if a different program is required, then a new system must be establishedaccording to the steps described previously. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 3710-08-M003 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 2 570-572 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 3710-08-C  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Appendix E_Requirements for Environmental Considerations_Global Commons</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(Refer to Department of Defense, Final Procedures issued April 12,1979 (44 FR 21786), 32 CFR Part 197, Enclosure 1.
