Gigot </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><TEXT>   When people say Jesse Jackson's campaign success has been remarkable, they are usually referring to the fact that a black man is doing so well. Apart from its condescension, the thought misses what is really much more remarkable about the Rev. Jackson's campaign: That someone with so left-wing a message is doing so well.    In their presidential wilderness years, after all, Democrats were supposed to have been debating how to adapt their message to Ronald Reagan's success. In economic policy, the party's brightest minds have struggled to factor incentives for growth into their plans to promote greater equity. Others, such as former Virginia Gov. Chuck Robb, have argued for a more realistic foreign policy.    Yet the substance of Mr. Jackson's message suggests that he's never even heard of that debate. The cliche is that Mr. Jackson has moved, since his 1984 campaign, into the Democratic &quot;mainstream.&quot; The truth is that the shift is more form than substance. Mr. Jackson does rail less against the party establishment, and his social message -- on drugs and individual responsibility -- tends to mask his more extreme positions. But beneath the jab and feint of tactics, Mr. Jackson's message might best be described as the politics of socialist joy. His economic and defense programs, in particular, make Mr. Jackson not merely &quot;the most liberal&quot; Democrat but an authentically radical voice. It is a voice more typical of the British Labor Party than of American politics.    Don't just take my word for it. Listen to the left itself cheer. In The New Republic last month, Barbara Ehrenreich, co-chair of the Democratic Socialists of America, quoted approvingly a line that what the Democrats need is &quot;a little class warfare.&quot; She exulted that Mr. Jackson sounds on the stump like &quot;an a cappella Woody Guthrie&quot; who employs an &quot;old-fashioned left-wing demagoguery&quot; that &quot;we haven't heard . . . around here for a long time.&quot; In the far left Nation magazine, Andrew Kopkind writes, with ironic appreciation, that Mr. Jackson is in an important sense &quot;running that unspeakable anomaly, that horror of all horrors, a 'class campaign.'&quot;    The evidence for the left's enthusiasm is clear enough in the Jackson campaign's position papers.    On foreign policy and defense, for example, Mr. Jackson's position is less &quot;blame America first&quot; than blame America only. His literature hails him as &quot;A True Peace Candidate,&quot; noting that only Mr. Jackson went to Nicaragua in 1984 &quot;to stand up against Reagan's secret wars&quot; (and praise Sandinista leaders), and only Mr. Jackson visited Cuba to oppose the lack of U.S. relations with Castro. He accuses the U.S. of &quot;knee-jerk anti-communism&quot; but says hardly anything critical of the Soviets. &quot;Peace in Central America hinges on a change in U.S. policy,&quot; says one issues brief, as if the Ortega brothers had nothing to do with it.    While most Democrats disapprove of some major U.S. weapons programs, Mr. Jackson appears to oppose all of them. He says we don't need the MX missile, the Midgetman missile (though Democrat Rep. Les Aspin is its chief supporter), the Trident D-5 missile, a refurbished F-15 fighter, the Stealth bomber, anti-satellite weapons and even cruise missiles. SDI is naturally beyond the pale. What weapons does he support? He doesn't say.    As for his domestic ideas, they might be called McGovernism, except that's unfair to Mr. McGovern. He supports the Family Farm Act, for example, though that bill would impose production controls and licensing tantamount to government management of agriculture. The idea is so radical that even the Democratic Congress can't come close to passing it.    Mr. Jackson's platform also includes plenty of corporation bashing -- a populist staple to be sure, though Mr. Jackson takes things further by proposing an undefined &quot;code of conduct&quot; that would make it difficult to invest overseas. Instead of import controls, in other words, Mr. Jackson in effect supports capital controls -- an idea tried but discarded by President Mitterrand's socialists in France.    As for social problems, Mr. Jackson's answer is to nationalize them. He'd nationalize the U.S. health-care system (claiming that government control would actually reduce costs). He'd make companies pay &quot;future cleanup costs&quot; even before they polluted anything, and, among myriad other things, &quot;phase out&quot; nuclear power and prevent offshore oil-drilling. My personal favorite is his idea for &quot;a major federal program to rebuild and insulate homes&quot; to use less energy.    Why such an extreme message should resonate among Democrats today is something of a mystery. One idea, popular among more conservative Democrats, is that reforms in their nominating process since the 1970s have put too much power into the hands of party activists. Another may be the principle that every force breeds its counterforce, so Reaganism has nurtured pent-up reaction from the left. It may be, too, that once other Democrats start to challenge his positions -- as Sen. Gore did this week -- his radicalism will be better known.    Another possibility is that many Democrats, deep down in their redistributive souls, may really like Mr. Jackson's message. Mr. Jackson just could be the Democrats' Goldwater, an insurgent who represents their future. </TEXT></DOC>
