Glenn Eady, regional compliance officer for the U.S. InterstateCommerce Commission in Philadelphia, said an ICC board approvedfour temporary applications Saturday for bus companies in theeastern region. The region includes 23 states from Maine toFlorida, but none of the companies serves points south of Virginia,he said.   ``The response is not what we expected,'' Eady said Sunday.   ICC offices in Chicago and San Francisco also stayed open duringthe weekend to handle applications.   When the strike by the Amalgamated Council of Greyhound LocalUnions began Friday, it initially stranded thousands of passengers.But the company brought in temporary drivers and Greyhound ChairmanFred G. Currey claimed the company kept 25 percent of its routesrunning, with the help of some union drivers crossing picket lines.   The company contends 350 union drivers have crossed picket linesto work, but Union President Edward M. Strait said Sunday that acareful count by strikers turned up just 95.   ``We ... hope that Greyhound management will soon realize thatthe only way they will be able to provide the traveling public withsafe and affordable intercity bus transportation is by returning tothe negotiationg table for good-faith bargaining on a fair andequitable contract,'' Strait said.   The union, which represents more than 9,000 employees, went onstrike after negotiators in Scottsdale, Ariz., failed to reachagreement on wage issues. The strikers include the company's 6,300drivers.   On Sunday, some strikers in Washington state stayed off thepicket lines in honor of Robert Waterhouse, 59, a union member whowas killed on a picket line Saturday in Redding, Calif. Waterhousewas crushed against a building by a bus driven by a driver hired asa temporary replacement.   Greyhound's Currey said he was told the driver was trying tomaneuver around a pickup truck driven by a striker.   The replacement driver, Theodore Graham, left the scene. He toldinvestigators later that he hadn't realized he hit anyone,according to a statement released Sunday by the Redding PoliceDepartment.   Pickets trying to slow the bus yelled at the driver and hit thebus with their signs as it pulled away from the terminal, and thebus had a minor crash with a striker's pickup truck on the way out,police said. He later flagged down a Highway Patrol car to reportthe minor crash, and was taken in for questioning about thestriker's death, police said.   No charges were filed, and police referred the case to theDistrict Attorney for a final determination.   ``We don't believe that he intentionally ran over this person,''Redding police investigator John Severson said Saturday.   The victim was preparing to retire this year, said his wife,Dorie Waterhouse.   ``It really wasn't even his strike,'' Mrs. Waterhouse said.``But he was in there in support of his fellow drivers. He keptsaying, ``It's a matter of self pride.''   Striking drivers in Olympia, Wash., said they would cancelpicketing Sunday to observe a day of mourning for Waterhouse.   In addition to the death, there have been a few violentincidents, including shots fired at a bus in Chicago on Friday.   In Philadelphia, police said a Greyhound passenger awaitedarraignment Sunday on a charge of simple assault for allegedlyspraying a striker with a pocket tear gas canister. Officer AlTenuto said the passenger got in an argument with a striking driverafter getting off a bus.   In Jacksonville, Fla., a striking Greyhound driver was struck bya bus Saturday, but was uninjured. The driver, Donald D. White, a27-year Greyhound veteran, told police the slow-moving bus didn'tstop as he walked across the street.   ``I was more mad that hurt,'' said White.   In Spokane, Wash., charter drivers found panels torn open andelectrical wires cut when they went to start their buses Sundaymorning, said Greyhound's area manager, Mike Ford. They were unableto start the buses, which weren't intended for use on scheduledGreyhound runs.   Currey said the company had asked federal courts in five citiesto issue restraining orders against strike's violence.   Currey led an investment group that paid $270 million forGreyhound in 1987, then bought Trailways Lines Inc. four monthslater for $80 million.   Before that buyout, the drivers union agreed to a 22 percentwage cut, but Currey said Greyhound drivers remain the highest paidin the industry.   No negotiations were scheduled in the dispute.   The union contends the company hasn't moved substantially from aJan. 10 proposal that was turned down by almost 92 percent of itsmembership.   However Currey said Saturday the company had made twosubstantial concessions: agreeing to scrap a proposal for incentivepay and to ban subcontracting or franchising of routes.</TEXT></DOC>
