The authors focus on the Californianatural gas distribution system, showing how the California Public UtiliesCommission increasingly exercised its authority to set rates so as tomeet social goals. Among these goals were lower fuel oil use, lower residentialrates, and greater small power production. However, by calling on largeusers to pay substantially above their costs to subsidize these programs,the system was left open to cream-skimming entry. When a major new marketfor natural gas in the Kern County oil fields arose, several groups appliedto the Federanl Energy Regulatory Commission to build an interstate gaspipeline - Califronia's first- dedicated to serving those customers.The proposals are being considered because of past pricing trends, becauseof the desire to avoid state regulatory oversight of their operations,and because they can be used to evade federal price regulations on naturalgas. However, from a societal economic standpoint, all of the pipelineswould be exceedingly expensive. The case demonstrates the unexpectedand often the perverse consequences of pursuing social goals within aregulatory framework.</TEXT></DOC>
