(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   PTL founder Jim Bakker is likely to beindicted by a federal grand jury investigating how the ministry'sleaders raised and spent millions of dollars in contributions, hisattorney said.   ``It's a question of when, and what the particular allegationswill be,'' lawyer Jim Toms said.   The 23-member grand jury reconvened this morning in Charlotte.   Toms said Friday that the indictment is likely to come the weekof Dec. 12.   Bakker, who resigned as PTL president in March 1987 after therevelation that he had a tryst with church secretary Jessica Hahnand paid her hush money, has denied any criminal wrongdoing, and hascalled the investigation ``a fishing expedition.''   Three months ago he predicted, ``I don't think I'll be indicted.I never have. If I am, I'll be shocked.''   Charles Alexander, the federal prosecutor handling the16-month-old investigation, wrote Bakker and at least two of hisformer associates last month informing them that they were targetsof the probe and inviting them to appear before the grand jury thisweek, The Charlotte Observer reported.   Toms said he has had several telephone conversations withAlexander, and his expectation that Bakker will be indicted is``just my impression based on my experience and the conversations. Ithink that's consistent with the kind of talk he's (Alexander) givenme.''   Bakker is preaching at his new church, New Covenant Church, inCharlotte.</TEXT></DOC>
