Gonzalez and Cuban General Patricio de la Guardia at the general's recent drug trial. According to the official transcript, it went like this:    Gonzalez: De la Guardia, you held the rank of brigadier general. . . . Had you been on other internationalist missions prior to the one in Angola?    De la Guardia: In Chile.    Gonzalez: After that mission did you receive an award?    De la Guardia: I received the Internationalist Medal in the first degree because I was in Chile commanding the troops when the coup d'etat in Chile occurred. I also carried out other special tasks, other special operations. </TEXT></DOC>
