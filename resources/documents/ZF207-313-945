 A futureenhancement will allow for connecting multiple Ethernet and token-ring LANsto the network.andM;&quot;Connecting the FiberTalk 1000 network management system to an In-Net stationon the network provides complete management facilities for comprehensivenetwork management,&quot; said John Mazzaferro, In-Net's director of marketing.andM;The other hardware products are the FiberTalk 3000 channel extension unit(CEU) and the FiberTalk 3000 channel interface unit (CIU), each priced at$35,000.andM;The CEU is a channel-to-peripheral device controller for linking IBM Corp.andO;and compatible host processors to geographically dispersed peripheral devicessuch as computer-aided design and-manufacturing stations and printers via anFDDI network.andM;The CEU, which can be placed up to 2 kilometers from the FDDI ring withoutrepeaters, does not require modification to the mainframe's operating systemor the addition of custom input/output drivers.andP;  The CIU, on the other hand,connects IBM and plug-compatible mainframes to the network.andM;All of the products will be available in late May or early June, officialssaid.andM;Fibronics, meanwhile, offers its own connection hardware, the FX8222, tochannel-attach IBM and compatible mainframes to an FDDI backbone network.andO;The networking device allows the attached system to communicate with othersystems hooked up to it.andP;  It also gives the host access to Ethernet LANs thatare connected to the network via an FDDI bridge, such as the FibronicsFX8210.andM;Used with the company's KNET software, a TCP/IP product for mainframes, theFX8222 allows users of the military standard protocol to access mainframefiles and applications via the FDDI backbone.andM;Thus, for instance, a user of a Sun Micro-systems Inc. workstation on anEthernet network can use the standard File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and Telnetto access files and applications on the host on the FDDI network, said HalSpurney, Fibronics marketing director.andM;The F8222, which will be available later this month, is priced at $35,500.andO;The list price with the optional bypass switch is $38,400.andM;Proteon Inc. of Westboro, Mass., will introduce the p3282, a fiber-opticmodem that is the latest addition to the firm's ProNET-80, Proteon's80-megabit/sec optical-fiber network.andM;The modem, which runs over single-mode fiber, extends a ProNET-80's link froma maximum of 2 kilometers to a maximum of 30 kilometers, without having touse repeaters.andP;  As a result, the modem can be used to replace leased1.544-megabit/sec or faster lines for point-to-point connections.andM;The modem, priced at $10,000, will be available in the second quarter afterbeta testing.andM;Ameritec Corp., Covina, Calif., will announce a product for call generatingor load testing via the basic rate interface (BRI) of a switch that uses thesame Integrated Service Digital Network (ISDN) protocol as ATandamp;T Co.'s 5ESSswitch.andM;The AM1-ISDN connects to a switch at the four-wire BRI via modularconnectors.andP;  Ten of these four-wire interfaces or lines are available in theAM1-ISDN, though for expansion purposes the AM1E-ISDN can be added to supplyan additional 20 four-wire lines.andP;  Each line has an originate port for voiceor data and a terminate port.andM;Up to 15 sets of AM1-ISDN/AM1E-ISDN units can be chained together with eachgenerating about 15,000 calls an hour.andM;The AM1-ISDN, scheduled to be available in March or April, lists for $24,950.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
