The word came in a Sunday editorial in the English-languageTehran Times and coincided with a visit by British diplomat DavidReddaway, who said Foreign Ministry officials told him he will beable to meet this week with an Englishman being held on spyingcharges.   In London, a senior aide to Archbishop of Canterbury RobertRuncie said today he is cautious about a quick release of hostagesfollowing talks with an Iranian diplomat in London.   The Tehran Times editorial said: ``Undoubtedly the IslamicRepublic of Iran will spare no effort to press ahead with therelease of British hostages, particularly Terry Waite,'' referringto Runcie's envoy.   ``Yet what Iran legitimately expects of Britain is to provideIran with all the information possible about the fate of fourIranian hostages'' believed held by Christian militia ``under theinfluence of Britain,'' it added.   Four Iranians disappeared in a Christian-controlled area ofLebanon in 1982. No group ever claimed to hold them and somereports have said they were killed.   Waite and two other Britons are among 18 foreigners believedheld by groups affiliated with the pro-Iranian and Shiite MoslemHezbollah, or Party of God, in Lebanon. The 18 include nineAmericans.   The editorial also follows talks in Britain last week betweenRuncie, spiritual leader of the Anglican Church, and Mohamed RezaSaid Mohamedi, an Iranian Foreign Ministry official.   John Lyttle, Runcie's senior assistant, said in London todaythat whether Iran chooses to pressure for the release of theBritish captives remains to be seen.   ``I don't think this is the time to talk about either assurancesor promises,'' Lyttle said in a British Broadcasting Corp. radiointerview.   ``I'm optimistic that he (Terry Waite) is alive and that theother British hostages are alive. As to whether anything is goingto happen quickly, I'm rather more cautious,'' he said.   Lyttle said he and the archbishop made clear to Mohamedi thatthe church has a limited role as far as the hostages are concerned.   ``We want to make it quite plain that the church cannot be analternative diplomatic channel, but that its interest is ahumanitarian one and a rather particular one. We may be able to oila wheel here and there, but we certainly can't act as analternative diplomatic channel,'' he said.   Reddaway said he met with Foreign Ministry officials twice onSunday and they told him he would be able to meet jailed EnglishmanRoger Cooper this week. He gave no other details.   Cooper, 52, a nephew of the late British poet and novelistRobert Graves, was arrested in December 1985 and has been held inTehran's Evin Prison.   Before leaving London on Friday, Reddaway said he would speakwith officials about the foreign hostages in Lebanon.   In July, an Anglican bishop went to Lebanon to initiateinquiries among Christians about the fate of the four Iraniansmissing in Lebanon.   Iran has been making conciliatory statements about relationswith Western nations since it announced July 18 it was accepting aU.N. call for a cease-fire in the 8-year-old Iran-Iraq war.   The cease-fire is scheduled to take hold Saturday.   Last summer, Britain withdrew all its diplomats from Iran andvirtually severed ties after a British diplomat was detained andbeaten in apparent reprisal for British police arresting an Iranianenvoy on shoplifting charges. One Iranian diplomat remains inLondon.   Waite disappeared in January 1987 while trying to secure therelease of American hostages. The other two British citizensbelieved held in Lebanon are journalist John McCarthy, kidnapped onApril 17, 1986 and university professor Brian Keenan, kidnappedApril 11, 1986. Keenan also holds an Irish passport.   Britain says it also seeks word on Alec Collett, a NewYork-based British journalist whose Palestinian abductors claimthey killed him. His body was never found.   The foreigner held longest is American Terry Anderson, chiefMiddle East correspondent for The Associated Press. He was abductedMarch 16, 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
