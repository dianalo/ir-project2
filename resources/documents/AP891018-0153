William Craig, 44, who was one of four people indicted, pleadedguilty Tuesday in federal court to one count of failing to disclosethe payments and to two counts of assisting in the preparation offalse federal income tax returns.   Craig and fellow record promoter Ralph Tashjian, 41, of SanMateo were accused by prosecutors of making payments totalingnearly $300,000 to radio station executives in Southern and Westernstates between 1980 and 1986. Failing to disclose payola _ not thepaying of it _ is a violation of federal law.   The charges stemmed from an investigation by the JusticeDepartment's Organized Crime Strike Force. Four people, including aformer vice president and general manager of a Los Angeles radiostation that has since been sold, were indicted by a federal grandjury in February 1988.   U.S. Attorney Robert Bonner has said the indictments were themost significant payola case since the 1970s. He said many recordcompanies hired Craig and Tashjian to promote records _ withoutknowing their money allegedly was used as payola.   Tashjian's wife, Valerie, also was indicted, but charges againsther were later dropped. Charges remain against George WilsonCrowell, once an executive of the former KIQQ radio station thatlater was sold.   Tashjian pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge, one felonycount of filing a false tax return and one felony count ofobstructing a grand jury investigation. Neither he nor Craig hasbeen sentenced.</TEXT></DOC>
