<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-01-0066 </DOCNO><TEXT>A theory has been developed for the interaction of ideally polarizableparticles and biological cells in a steady (dc) electric field. The proposedapproach differs from the classical dipole-dipole theory in that thecarrier of the interaction is not the electric field, but rather thehydrodynamic field. For this reason, the indicated interaction decreaseswith increasing distance between particles at a considerably lower rate,similar to Coulomb interaction.</TEXT></DOC>
