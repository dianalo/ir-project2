Intel paid cash -- the amount wasn't disclosed -- and will pay royalties to GE for a number of years, Intel executives said at a news conference here. The Princeton, N.J., venture will become part of the microcomputer parts group at Intel, a semiconductor maker based in Santa Clara, Calif.    Intel said it intends to turn the technology, initially developed by RCA Corp. labs that GE bought in 1986, into an industry standard for allowing personal computers to read and manipulate digitized video, graphics and audio signals from a five-inch compact disk.    Digital video interactive technology &quot;is kind of like putting a TV in your PC and putting it under your control,&quot; said David House, senior vice president of Intel.    &quot;The next major step in computing is going to be driven by graphics,&quot; Intel Chairman Gordon Moore said. &quot;This is the most advanced graphic system in the world. It could be the next revolution in computing.&quot; The long-rumored sale by GE also breathes life into a vision held by old-time RCA researchers of turning television sets into interactive video devices.    In national over-the-counter trading Friday, Intel shares closed at $25.75, up 50 cents, on volume of more than 1.7 million shares.    Intel isn't alone in trying to set a standard for interactive audio and video capability for both personal computers and home entertainment equipment. Sony Corp. of Japan and North American Philips Corp., a unit of N.V. Philips of the Netherlands, have announced a competing technology, called CD-I. North American Philips said it will begin selling CD-I in U.S. business and education markets next year.    &quot;It takes quite some time to make a world standard,&quot; said a Philips spokeswoman, expressing skepticism about Intel's effort. &quot;These kinds of systems are driven by software, and we are quite far in talking with software companies in the states,&quot; among them, Microsoft Corp. But Intel's Mr. Moore said, &quot;This has enough of a technical lead and applicability in commercial and industrial markets that we should be able to get it accepted as a standard.&quot;    Intel executives said that for digital video interactive technology to become widespread, they must reduce the cost of the three circuit boards that read compressed video and audio signals from disks. They also must persuade software developers to write applications that people want to buy.    &quot;It's a wonderful technology,&quot; said Robert Brannon, an Intel executive who was named general manager of the venture. &quot;But technology is only worth as much as you can do with it in terms of selling it.&quot;    Currently, the three digital video interactive boards, which slip into International Business Machines Corp. personal computers and compatibles, cost a total of $2,000 to $3,000, Mr. Brannon said. Intel wants to reduce that to less than $500 for some boards and less than $1,000 for more advanced boards by late 1990 or early 1991, he said.    By the end of next year, Mr. Brannon expects 25 to 50 software companies to be able to ship products. The digital video interactive venture has shipped development kits that cost $25,000 each to 20 software houses and expects to ship kits to another 20 in the next three months, he said.    That timetable may be overly optimistic, analysts said. Robert Gutenstein, director of research at Kalb Voorhis andamp; Co., said: &quot;They need time to simplify the boards. And the critical thing is (that) they've got to get it accepted as a standard.&quot; He added, &quot;This is an industry that is going to take some years to develop.&quot;    It isn't clear what applications consumers and businesses will buy, executives said, but the market could be broad, ranging from training programs to design and entertainment. In demonstrations Friday, the technology was used to provide a tour of Mayan ruins, where the viewer could figuratively &quot;walk around&quot; by moving a joystick, viewing different perspectives on the screen of a personal computer.    Terrence H. Pocock, chairman of Cableshare Inc., London, Ontario, said his company is using the technology to develop a home-shopping service for cable television companies. Information about house sales, for example, could be stored on disks at a cable company's headquarters, then ordered by consumers through their phone lines. Using digital video interactive technology, Mr. Pocock said, could reduce by nearly tenfold the cost of such home-shopping systems, because information now is stored on much more costly equipment.    The technology also could be used to lead medical students through operations, said Jay Silber, a principal of Applied Optical Media Corp., a Malvern, Pa., start-up company that is licensing the technology. &quot;I'd love to have had learned physics on this, with electrons jumping out at me,&quot; Mr. Silber said. &quot;I would be a doctor now. Physics is why I got out of pre-med.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
