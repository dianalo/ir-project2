USFandamp;G said it cut its quarterly common stock dividend to 25cents a share effective Jan. 31, 1991, down from 73 cents a share.   The company also said its chairman, chief executive andpresident, Jack Moseley, 59, was retiring early. A successor forMoseley, who has served in those posts since 1981, has been foundand will be announced in several weeks, the company said.   ``The extended duration of the present trough in the propertyand casualty market and the economic uncertainty resulting from ageneral business downturn required these extraordinary actions,''the board announced.   The Baltimore-based company, which focuses on property, casualtyand life insurance, said the moves were designed to conservecapital and make the company more competitive.   John Bailey, a stock analyst with the Washington brokerage houseFerris, Baker Watts, said the dividend cut was expected, but theausterity program was not.   ``This is a positive step because it's decisive action to dealwith a difficult situation,'' Bailey said. ``I think the jury isstill out on whether it will be effective.''   Except for the fourth quarter of 1989, USFandamp;G had not earnedenough to pay its dividend since the beginning of 1989, Baileysaid. That hurt its ability to write new insurance coverage becauseit drained capital, he said.   Insurance premiums move cyclically, with prices declining asmore insurers enter the market and compete for business. Onceprices drop low enough, however, the weaker insurers are weeded outand prices begin to rise, Bailey said.   ``USFandamp;G is in a situation that when that upswing in priceshappens, they might not be able to take advantage of it,'' he said.``With the moves they take today, they improve their position totake advantage of rising prices.''   USFandamp;G said it would cut $75 million through layoffs andattrition at all levels and in all segments. USFandamp;G spokeswomanKerrie Burch-DeLuca said layoffs and other cost-cutting measureswould not be announced until after the new chairman takes over.   For the third quarter, the company said it lost $15 million, or22 cents a share, compared with a net loss of $17 million, or 25cents a share, for the same period a year earlier. Revenue in thequarter rose to $1.15 billion from $1.14 billion a year earlier.   For the first nine months, USFandamp;G earned $41.0 million, or 35cents a share, up from $15 million, or 3 cents a share, a year ago.Revenue was $3.42 billion for the first nine months of 1990, from$3.41 billion a year earlier.   USFandamp;G reported a $5 million loss in its financial servicessegment and a 4.8 percent decline in its equity portfolio, whichcomprises 13 percent of its $11.1 billion in invested assets.   USFandamp;G also said it had put aside $18 million in its real estateloan loss reserve fund, money used to cover non-performing loans,compared with $10 million in the same period last year. USFandamp;G,which has $13.9 billion in total assets, said it has a $1 billionreal estate portfolio, including $490 million in participatingmortgage loans.   USFandamp;G stock fell 10 percent Tuesday on the New York StockExchange amid speculation about a dividend cut, closing at $12.25.It fell again Wednesday, to $11.625.</TEXT></DOC>
