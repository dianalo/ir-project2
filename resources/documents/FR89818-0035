Dear, Lands Specialist, (703) 235-2493.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Forest Service Land Exchange Program</ITAG>Over the past 80 years, the Forest Service has completed approximately8,000 land exchange cases, acquiring almost 9.5 million acres of non-Federalland in exchange for about 3.5 million acres of Federal land. The westernnational forests, which were largely reserved from the public domain fornational forest purposes, have a consolidated landownership pattern withfew small tracts of non-Federal ownership. As a result, most Forest Serviceland exchanges in the West involve large acreages and blocks of land ownedby State and local governments, railroads, timber and mining companies,and ranchers. Such exchanges often involve the alternate section ``checkerboard''landownership patterns which resulted from land grants to railroads 100years ago. The eastern national forests were largely acquired tract-by-tractfrom non-Federal sources, resulting in a broken, unconsolidated landownershippattern. Most exchanges in the East involve individual landowners withsmall tracts.Land exchanges involving National Forest System lands were first authorizedin 1908. Since then, over 100 exchange laws affecting the national forestshave been passed. However, the two primary exchange authorities are theWeeks Act and the General Exchange Act. The Weeks Act of March 1, 1911(16 U.S.C. 516) is the principal authority for acquiring lands for nationalforest purposes in the East. The Act provides for the conveyance of nationalforest land or timber with Weeks Act status in exchange for non-Federallands which are chiefly valuable for regulation of the flow of navigablestreams or for timber production. The General Exchange Act of March 20,1922 (16 U.S.C. 485, 486), provides for the conveyance of National Forestlands or timber reserved from the public domain, in exchange for non-Federallands suitable for national forest purposes. The primary objective of theGeneral Exchange Act is the consolidation of national forest lands. Thesetwo Acts are supplemented by the Federal Land Policy and Management Actof October 21, 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1715, 1716), which provides for the exchangeof land or interests in land, requires that the lands being exchanged belocated in the same State, requires that State and local needs be considered,requires that property values exchanged be of equal value or equalizedby the payment of cash, requires that exchanges be in the public interest,and limits exchanges to United States citizens or corporations subjectto the laws of a State or the United States.Within the boundaries of the National Forest System, only 83 percent (191million acres) of the total land area (230 million acres) is under ForestService jurisdiction. Most of the remaining 17 percent (39 million acres)is in non-Federal ownership. Much of that non-Federal land is scatteredthroughout the national forests in small parcels. Such mixed ownershipis beneficial in many instances where non-Federal and national forest managementpractices compliment one another. However, in some areas, acquisition ofspecific non-Federal tracts of land is desirable to protect or improvethe management of the adjacent national Forest System land. For example,land exchanges are frequently used to acquire desirable lands in congressionallydesignated areas such as Wilderness Areas, National Recreation Areas, Wildand Scenic Rivers, and National Trails. Exchange has been the primary methodof land acquisition in the Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument,the Alpine Lakes Wilderness Area, and the Rattlesnake and Lee Metcalf WildernessAreas.The primary reason for the exchange of lands or interests in lands is toprovide for more efficient management of the National Forest System throughconsolidation of Federal landownership. Exchanges result in cost savingsthrough improved resource administration, reduced access needs, reducedproperty boundary survey needs, reduced or eliminated special-use administration,and resolution of title claims and encroachments. Cost savings in propertyboundary surveys along often exceed the cost to complete an exchange. Manyexchanges also assist local communities by exchanging isolated tracts ofnon-Federal lands for Federal lands adjacent to expanding communities,where the land is needed to facilitate development.Land exchange is the primary means of landownership adjustment for theForest Service. As the preferred alternative to direct purchase of needednon-Federal lands, land exchange provides a method of improving landownershippatterns with minimal impact on the Federal and local budgets. In an averageyear, the Forest Service completes 147 exchange cases, acquiring from willinglandowners 135,000 acres of non-Federal land in exchange for 92,000 acresof Federal land, with exchanged values of $102 million. Land exchange isexpected to continue to be an effective alternative to direct purchaseof needed and desirable non-Federal land for the National Forest System.<ITAG tagnum="84">Need for Rules</ITAG>The Federal Land Exchange Facilitation Act of 1988 (43 U.S.C. 1716), hasas its purpose to facilitate and expedite land exchanges under the authorityof the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior by streamliningand improving the procedures for such exchanges and by authorizing additionalfunding. The Act endorses the long-standing policy that land exchange isan important tool to consolidate landownership for purposes for more efficientmanagement and to secure important objectives of resource management, enhancement,development, and protection; to meet the needs of communities; to promotemultiple-use; and to fulfill other public needs. A significant featureof the Act is the authority for non-Federal parties to seek arbitrationof values of lands when they object to the valuation determined by theForest Service. The Act requires each Secretary to promulgate separaterules for exchanges of land, in recognition of the differing statutoryauthorities governing exchanges of the Federal lands under their respectivejurisdictions. However, the Forest Service has coordinated the developmentof these rules with the Bureau of Land Management in an attempt to attainsimilar procedures where possible.<ITAG tagnum="84">Features of the Proposed Rule</ITAG>The existing rules for conducting land exchanges, codified at Subpart Aof Part 254_Landownership Adjustments, would be revised to incorporatethe provisions of the Federal Land Exchange Facilitation Act of 1988, andotherwise rewritten to update obsolete portions with current provisionsand clarify obscure portions. The organization of the subpart would besubstantially revised. The principal features of the proposed rule keyedto the CFR section number are summarized here.<T3>Section 254.1_Scope and applicability. </T3>This section, which isnot significantly different from the existing requirements, would establishland exchanges as strictly voluntary transactions between the Forest Serviceand willing non-Federal parties. Because of differing authorities governingnational forest exchanges in Alaska, the rules would not fully apply tocertain land exchanges in the State of Alaska. This section provides anexemption clause for those exchanges formally initiated prior to promulgationof these rules. This section also makes clear that the authority utilizedin an exchange is dependent upon the status of the Federal land and thepurpose of the exchange, and provides a cross reference to further policyand guidelines for exchanges set forth in Forest Service Manual Chapter5400 and Forest Service Handbook 5409.13.<T3>Section 254.2_Definitions. </T3>The Federal Land Exchange FacilitationAct of 1988 embraced new terms which require definition and explanationto ensure uniformity in the application of the provisions of this Act.Accordingly, this section has been expanded significantly over the correspondingsection of the current regulations. The new terms come from several sources.The Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1715 <T3>et seq.</T3>) provides the definition of <T3>acquisition. </T3>The Federal Land Exchange Facilitation Act of 1988is the source of the terms <T3>approximately equal values, arbitration, bargaining, determinationof approximately equal values, relative values, </T3>and <T3>statement of value. Authorized forest officer </T3>was derived fromthe Forest Service Appeal Regulations at 36 CFR parts 217 and 251, as was<T3>formal proposal. Brokered exchange </T3>was developed from requirementsof GAO Report RCED-87-9 of February 5, 1987, entitled ``Federal Land Acquisitions.''<T3>Fair market value </T3>and <T3>highest and best use </T3>are as defined in the ``Uniform AppraisalStandards for Federal Land Acquisitions,'' May 1973. GPO Stock Number 052-059-00002-0.The definition of <T3>hazardous substances </T3>is as defined in Section 120(h) of the ComprehensiveEnvironmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended(42 U.S.C. 9601 <T3>et seq.</T3>). <T3>Qualified appraiser </T3>was developed from the Uniform RelocationAssistance and Real Property Acquisition Regulations for Federally AssistedPrograms at 49 CFR part 24. The definition of <T3>segregation </T3>was derived from the term as described in the Bureauof Land Management land exchange regulations at 43 CFR Part 2200. In addition,a definition of <T3>Secretary </T3>would be added for clarification.<T3>Section 254.3_Requirements. </T3>This section sets forth the minimumrequirements applicable to all exchanges. All Forest Service exchangesmust be subjected to certain tests of need, meet certain criteria, andbe governed by certain limitations. Generally, the proposed rule providesthat exchanges must be with United States citizens or coorporations, mustbe in the public interest, must not result in a decrease of public values,must involve lands within the same State, must be equal value, and mustbe consistent with the planning direction and objectives for a particularnational forest. This is consistent with the present rule, but adds emphasisto landownership adjustment planning in Forest Land Management Plans. Thisproposed rule would allow the payment of cash to equalize the values oflands to be exchanged and would allow the waiver of cash equalization paymentby the Forest Service, if the payment does not exceed the lesser of 3 percentof the value of the Federal land or $15,000. Cash equalization payment,a provision of the current rule, permits the use of cash to balance landexchange values after all reasonable and logical adjustments of involvedland values have been made. Waiver of cash equalization payments by theForest Service amounts to relatively small donations of land values bythe non-Federal party, when that party agrees to forgo collection of suchvalues in the interest of timely completion of an exchange.The Forest Service must reserve or retain such rights or interests as arenecessary to protect the public interest on the lands or partial interestsconveyed out of public ownership. Similarly, the lands acquired by theForest Service must not be prohibitively encumbered by reservations oroutstanding rights. The exercise of reserved rights on lands or interestsconveyed to the United States are subject to the Secretary's rules andregulations unless waived by the Forest Service. These requirements area continuation of those in the current rule and are necessary to ensurethat such conveyances and reservations do not interfere with the use andmanagement of the lands and interests retained for national forest purposes.The future use of land conveyed out of Federal ownership will be determinedby State and local zoning authorities. Such future use will not necessarilybe addressed in the land appraisal, which is based solely on the highestand best use of the property, since most Federal controls over use of theland cease upon conveyenace to non-Federal parties. Exceptions to suchloss of Federal control are reserved rights, deed restrictions, and certainFederal laws such as the wetlands dredge and fill permit requirements ofSection 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972(33 U.S.C. 1251), as amended by the Clean Water Act of 1977 (33 U.S.C.1344).The Environmental Protection Agency is in the process of promulgating finalrules on hazardous substances. Accordingly, this section of the proposedrule recognizes that the Forest Service should determine if hazardous materialsare present on the involved non-Federal lands and negotiate the responsibilityfor control action with the non-Federal party prior to completing an exchange.A new provision of the Exchange Facilitation Act states that lands recentlyacquired by the Forest Service which become subject to entry under themining and mineral leasing laws automatically will be segregated from suchentry for 90 days upon acceptance of title by the Forest Service. Thatsegregation will terminate automatically at the end of the 90-day period,unless the Forest Service requests the Secretary of the Interior to withdrawthe lands from entry. This provision is incorporated in the proposed rule.At 7 CFR 2.42, the Secretary has delegated authority to the Chief of theForest Service to extend Weeks Act national forest boundaries in orderto acquire up to 3,000 acres of land in each case under the Weeks Act authority.This rule would provide that when a land acquisition case requires a nationalforest boundary extension, such extension will be automatic upon approvalof a Weeks Act acquisition by an authorized forest officer.The proposed rule would update existing regulations to make clear certainspecific requirements that apply to acquisitions over a certain value.Weeks Act acquisitions of $150,000 or more in value, including both exchangesand purchases of land, are subject to a 30-day oversight review by theHouse and Senate Committees on Agriculture. The proposed rule would providecertain exceptions to the requirement that the Secretary of Agriculturemust approve such acquisitions over $250,000 in value. Insignificant changesthat occur after completion of oversight or Secretarial approval wouldbe exempt from any required resubmission for such oversight or approval.Acquisitions, including exchanges, which are specifically required by enactedlegislation, generally would be exempted from congressional oversight orSecretarial approval.<T3>Section 254.4_Initiating an exchange. </T3>This section would reviseexisting procedures by which a non-Federal party can initiate an exchange.Under the proposed rule, a non-Federal landowner interested in an exchangewith the Forest Service could make a proposal for an exchange to the appropriateForest Service officer. The rule would make clear that either party mayreject a proposal or withdraw from an exchange at any time prior to enteringa binding exchange agreement.The rule would provide that the parties will document their preliminaryagreement to initiate an exchange in a signed Statement of Intent. TheExchange Facilitation Act requires that exchange parties comply with specifictime frames for the appraisal process. The Act establishes the preliminaryagreement to exchange as the starting point for those appraisal time frames.The Forest Service proposes to adopt the Statement of Intent, an optionaldocument under current rules, as a mandatory document for every land exchangeproposal to clearly and firmly establish the starting point for the appraisaltime frames. As a minimum, the Statement of Intent would include certificationof citizenship, statement of ownership, notice of hazardous substances,responsibilities of each party, identification of the Federal and non-Federalproperties, and permission to enter and examine the lands of each party.The parties may also arrange for an appraisal in the Statement of Intent.Otherwise, within 90 days of signing the Statement of Intent, the partiesmust negotiate and agree upon the terms of the appraisal and the expectedappraisal completion date.<T3>Section 254.5_Responsibilities. </T3>Land exchanges are complex undertakingsinvolving a series of costs, responsibilities, and requirements which mustbe met or accomplished in order to successfully complete an exchange. Particularresponsibilities typically rest with either the Federal or non-Federalparties, or both, varying according to local custom. Although a commonpractice in past exchanges, the new rule specifies for the first time thatsome responsibilities may be negotiated in each case. Under the proposedrule, it would be the general practice that each party will pay their ownnormal expenses in a land exchange, but, subject to the needs of the ForestService in processing an exchange, either party may assume the costs normallyborne by the other party. The parties may agree that such assumption ofcosts will be without compensation. In special and exceptional circumstances,the Forest Service may determine that it is in the public interest to compensatea non-Federal party for assuming costs normally borne by the Forest Service.The new rule specifies that such compensation will be on an exceptionalbasis only, will be limited to 25 percent of the value of the Federal lands,and must meet certain criteria. The intent of these limitations and criteriais to avoid routine adjustments of relative exchanged values, which amountsto the use of National Forest System land values to pay for the cost ofprocessing land exchanges. Such activity could seldom be determined tobe in the public interest.<T3>Section 254.6_Legal description of properties. </T3>This section isessentially the same as the existing rule and describes the requirementsfor describing or locating the lands involved in an exchange.<T3>Section 254.7_Appraisals. </T3>As does the current rule, this sectionwould establish the ``Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land Acquisitions''as the Forest Service national standard for appraising both the Federaland non-Federal lands in an exchange. However, the new rule would supplementthose standards with portions of the ``Uniform Standards of ProfessionalAppraisal Practice,'' to the extent that they do not conflict with theformer standards.For purposes of the appraisal, Federal lands will be considered as thoughthey are already in non-Federal ownership, zoned for their highest andbest use. Appraisals are required to be no more than one year old at thetime a binding exchange agreement is entered, which ``locks in'' the values.Appraisals are to be made by qualified staff or private-sector appraisers,in accordance with Forest Service criteria for qualification.There are individuals and organizations that sometimes act as brokers toassemble multiple parcels of land for exchange in furtherance of NationalForest System management objectives at the request or with the cooperationof the Forest Service. Previous rules and authorities operated to penalizesuch brokers by requiring that such parcels be considered as a single ownershipfor appraisal purposes. This typically resulted in a reduced valuationof the involved properties. The proposed rule would treat brokered exchangesinvolving assembled multiple parcels as individual tracts in the appraisalof such exchange properties rather than impose a penalty on the brokerfor assembling the properties at the request or with the cooperation ofthe Forest Service. In most cases, such treatment as individual tractswould result in higher appraised values. It is in the public interest toutilize brokered exchanges, due to the efficiency and economy of replacinga number of small exchanges with a single large exchange. This specialtreatment will not apply when an individual owning multiple parcels proposesto exchange those parcels in a single exchange. When a non-Federal partyassembles a number of scattered non-Federal parcels for a brokered exchangeand the non-Federal parcels are considered as individual parcels in anexchange appraisal, the same individual-tract treatment will be used inthe appraisal of any multiple-parcel Federal lands involved in the exchange.<T3>Section 254.8_Approximately equal value exchanges. </T3>In the interestof accelerating the processing of relatively small exchanges and reducingcosts, the Forest Service may proceed with certain exchanges of similartracts of land under $150,000 in value on the basis of a determinationthat the values are approximately equal when it is in the public interestto expedite an exchange. This new authority is provided by the ExchangeFacilitation Act. Such simplified valuation does not require formal appraisalreports, but is based on Statements of Value which summarize the conclusionsreached by a qualified staff appraiser in estimating the values. The preparationof Statements of Value would be limited to Forest Service staff appraisers,due to the need to maintain control over the appraisal evidence supportinga Statement of Value. Statements of Value would have the same one-yearmaximum life span as do formal appraisal reports and values would be ``lockedin'' upon entering into a binding exchange agreement.<T3>Section 254.9_Arbitration of valuation. </T3>A major provision of thenew Exchange Facilitation Act authorizes arbitration of disagreements overappraised values. The Act provides that if, within 180 days after appraisalsare submitted to the authorized forest officer for review and approval,the parties cannot agree on the valuation, the issue may be settled througharbitration. The Act also provides that, in lieu of arbitration of values,the parties may agree to bargain. The Forest Service proposes that suchbargaining may include various alternative uses of appraisers, appraisals,or appraisal reviews, or it may involve negotiation outside of the appraisalprocess. Arbitration would be conducted according to the Real Estate Valuation ArbitrationRules of the American Arbitration Association, in accordance with the Act,with the following special considerations and treatments: (a) When an exchange party files a notice of intent to arbitrate, the ForestService would appoint an arbitrator from a list of qualified arbitratorsfurnished by the American Arbitration Association. (b) Forest Service interpretation of the Act finds that arbitration islimited to resolution of a disputed valuation for a proposed land exchangeand an arbitrator's award decision must not have application beyond thevalue estimate(s) of the questioned appraisal(s). An award decision cannotinclude recommendations affecting any aspects of an exchange proposal otherthan valuation. An award decision cannot recommend changes in an exchangeproposal which affect management decisions in order to achieve a desiredchange in valuation. (c) Award decisions may be effective for a maximum of two years if theparties agree in writing within 30 days after completion of arbitrationto consummate an exchange. However, the Forest Service proposes that anysubsequent adjustments in the elements of a proposed exchange which resultin changes in valuation will render an arbitrator's award decision moot.As provided in the Exchange Facilitation Act, the parties may agree, inrecognition of scheduling problems, processing obstacles, and special requirementswhich may be unique to any particular land exchange proposal, that thefollowing time frames and deadlines may be changed or eliminated: (a) The requirement to arrange for an appraisal, set its completion date,and negotiate terms of an appraisal within 90 days of entering into a Statementof Intent. (b) The requirement to submit an exchange to arbitration if agreement onvaluation has not been reached within 180 days after submission of theappraisal(s) to the authorized forest officer for approval. (c) The requirement for all parties to decide to proceed with an exchangeand accept the arbitrator's award decision or withdraw from an exchangeproposal within 30 days after delivery of the decision on the arbitration.Although arbitration is set forth in the Exchange Facilitation Act as amandatory consequence of non-negotiable disagreement over valuation, theAct also confirms that either party may withdraw from an exchange <T3>at any time </T3>before entering into a binding exchange agreement.Therefore, it would be the policy and practice of the Forest Service toproceed with the additional expense and delay associated with the arbitrationprocess only in exceptional cases, if justified by compelling public interest.<T3>Section 254.10_Publication of proposed exchange. </T3>In managing theNational Forest System, the Forest Service has an obligation to keep thepublic fully informed of all activities including landownership adjustmentsthrough exchange. As in the existing rule, the public notice requirementsin this section of the proposed rule would serve to inform the generalpublic of the exchange proposal, to provide an opportunity for those withclaims to come forward, and to offer a comment period for those who wishto express their views about a proposed exchange. However, a new provisionof the rule would establish that minor corrections and insignificant changes(additions or deletions) would not require the republishing of a noticeas long as the general concept and basis of an exchange remain the same.The proposed rule would continue to provide 15 days from the date of finalpublication for submission of written comments on an exchange proposal.This time period is necessary to allow sufficient time to analyze and considerthose comments in the environmental analysis without delaying the exchangeprocess. However, if the environmental analysis is at a stage where latecomments can be accommodated, they will be considered. <T3>Section 254.11</T3><T3>_Approval of exchange. </T3>The proposed new rule would clarify thatapproval of an exchange proposal occurs when an authorized forest officersigns a decision document to proceed with an exchange. The decision maybe documented in a Decision Notice for an Environmental Assessment witha Finding of No Significant Impact; a Record of Decision for an EnvironmentalImpact Statement; or a Decision Memo where the action is found to be categoricallyexcluded from documentation in an Environmental Assessment or an EnvironmentalImpact Statement. Notice of a decision is to be provided to all interestedparties. The proposed rule notes that conditional decisions may be madesubject to certain actions that must be completed prior to completion ofan exchange, such as congressional oversight or Secretarial approval. Anexchange agreement may be entered into by the parties after final or conditionalapproval of an exchange proposal by the Forest Service. <T3>Section 254.12_Appeal of exchanges. </T3>The proposed rule providesthat a written decision to proceed or not to proceed with a land exchangeproposal, made upon completion of an environmental analysis in compliancewith the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), is the only appealablepoint in the exchange process. The provision is basically a restatementof what is appealable under the agency's new appeal procedures at 36 CFRpart 217. Previously, appeals of such decisions were entered under 36 CFR211.18. With adoption of final revisions to administrative appeals (54FR 3342, January 23, 1989), these decisions would now be appealable underthe procedures at 36 CFR part 217. Decisions related to exchanges are notappealable under the rules at 36 CFR part 251, subpart C, because exchangedoes not involve occupancy and use of National Forest System lands. Rejectionsof exchange proposals are not subject to appeal, when such rejections aremade in advance of written decisions resulting from analysis, documentation,and other requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act. Appealspursuant to 36 CFR part 217 may be made by anyone objecting to an exchangeproposal. <T3>Section 254.13_Exchange agreement. </T3>The proposed rule would continuethe provision of the existing rule, that it is desirable but not mandatoryto enter into an exchange agreement, once a decision is made to proceedwith an exchange proposal. Under the proposed rule, Forest Service exchangesgenerally would utilize exchange agreements unless in the judgment of anauthorized forest officer, such a binding contract to exchange is not needed.An exchange agreement is a binding contract between the Forest Serviceand the non-Federal party to complete an exchange. An exchange agreementshould be made subject to certain final uncompleted exchange processesand contingencies that might occur prior to consummation of an exchange.The proposed rule contains a new requirement that certification of theabsence of known hazardous substances on involved lands be made in an exchangeagreement document or, in the absence of an exchange agreement, in someother suitable document. Under the proposed rule, if no exchange agreementis entered into by the parties, either party may back out of an exchangeproposal at any time prior to issuance of the deeds, regardless of theinvestment of time and money in the proposal.<T3>Section 254.14_Conveyance documents. </T3>As provided under the existingrule, exchange deeds are issued by the Forest Service in conveying acquiredFederal lands, and patents or quitclaim deeds are issued by the Bureauof Land Management in conveying national forest land reserved from thepublic domain for national forest purposes. A new provision reflected inthis proposed rule is that of simultaneous issuance of conveyance documents,as required by the Exchange Facilitation Act. Simultaneous issuance ofconveyance documents is possible when the parties can comply with the instructionsissued with a preliminary title opinion by the Office of the General Counselof the Department of Agriculture. However, the rule provides that partiesshould be prepared to waive the requirement for simultaneous issuance ofconveyance documents when such requirement is not practicable. <T3>Section 254.15_Title evidence and approval. </T3>As provided in thecurrent rule, the Office of the General Counsel of the Department of Agriculturehas the delegated authority to approve title to lands being conveyed tothe United States in Forest Service acquisitions. The non-Federal partymust furnish insurable title to the lands to be conveyed to the UnitedStates in Forest Service land exchanges. The proposed rule contains a newprovision that title acceptance by the Forest Service occurs after theOffice of the General Counsel of the Department of Agriculture issues thefinal title opinion. This provision is necessary to establish the startingpoint for the 90-day automatic segregation of lands acquired in an exchange,as provided by the Exchange Facilitation Act. <ITAG tagnum="84">Summary </ITAG>These proposed regulations would help facilitate and expedite Forest Serviceland exchanges by clarifying exchange authorities, their scope, and application;determining exceptions to application of rules; defining terms used inexchanges; stating general and specific requirements of land exchanges;delineating procedures in initiating exchanges; establishing the responsibilityfor duties and costs associated with land exchanges and the conditionsunder which one party may assume those costs, responsibilities, and requirementsof the other party; providing rules pertaining to land appraisals whichreflect nationally recognized appraisal standards; describing conditionsand limitations for approximately equal value exchanges; prescribing proceduresand guidelines for resolution of appraisal disputes; stating the minimumrequirements for providing public notice of an exchange; establishing therules under which an exchange may be approved and appealed; outlining therequirements for a binding exchange agreement; and, by setting forth thelegal standards and requirements for the description of the propertiesto be exchanged, the conveyance documents, and the title evidence and approval.The public is invited to submit written comments in opposition or supportof the new or continuing provisions of this proposed rule. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Impact </ITAG>This proposed rule has been reviewed under USDA procedures and ExecutiveOrder 12291 on Federal Regulations. It has been determined that this isnot a major rule. The rule would not have an effect of $100 million ormore on the economy; would not substantially increase prices or costs forconsumers, industry, or State or local governments; nor would it adverselyaffect competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, orthe ability of United States-based enterprises to compete in foreign markets.Moreover, this proposed rule has been considered in light of the RegulatoryFlexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>), and it has been determined that this action would nothave a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Impact </ITAG>Based on experience, this proposed rule would not have a significant effecton the human environment, individually or cumulatively.

In accordance with those rulesand the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507), the Forest Servicehas requested Office of Management and Budget review and approval of theinformation required to be addressed in a Statement of Intent or exchangeagreement.

The procedures in these rules are supplementedby instructions issued to Forest Service officers in chapter 5400 of theForest Service Manual and Forest Service Handbook 5409.13. (b) These rules are applicable to all National Forest System land exchanges,except those made under the authority of the Small Tracts Act of January12, 1983 (16 U.S.C. 521c-521i), and as otherwise noted. However, applicationof these rules to exchanges made under the authority of the Alaska NativeClaims Settlement Act, as amended (43 U.S.C. 1621) and the Alaska NationalInterest Lands Conservation Act (16 U.S.C. 3192), shall be limited to thoserules which do not conflict with the provisions of those Acts. (c) The Secretary of Agriculture is not required to exchange any part ofthe National Forest System. Land exchanges are discretionary, voluntaryreal estate transactions between the Secretary of Agriculture, acting byand through the Forest Service, and non-Federal landowners. These transactionsmay involve the exchange of lands or interests therein. (d) Unless the parties to an exchange otherwise agree, land exchanges forwhich an agreement to initiate an exchange was entered into prior to [<T3>Insert effective date of final rule.</T3>], may proceed in accordancewith existing laws and regulations in effect at the time the Statementof Intent was signed. (e) Land exchanges involving National Forest System lands are governedby the exchange statute appropriate to the particular status of the NationalForest System land in question and the purpose for which an exchange isto be made. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 254.2</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Definitions. </ITAG>For the purposes of this subpart, the following terms shall have the meaningset forth in this section. <T3>Acquisition </T3>includes the acquiring of lands or interests in landsby the Secretary of Agriculture, as delegated to the Forest Service, byexchange, purchase, donation, or eminent domain. <T3>Approximately equal value</T3> is a comparative estimate of the valueof lands involved in an exchange where the elements of value, such as physicalcharacteristics and other amenities, are readily apparent and substantiallysimilar. <T3>Arbitration</T3> is a process by which exchange parties may submitdisputes over valuation to an arbitrator appointed by the Forest Servicefrom a list of arbitrators submitted by the American Arbitration Association.An <T3>authorized forest officer </T3>is a Forest Service line or staff officerwho has the delegated authority and responsibility to make and executeindicated decisions.<T3>Bargaining </T3>is a process for determining an acceptable value forproperties involved in an exchange, when the parties cannot agree on theinitial appraised valuation. A <T3>brokered exchange </T3>occurs when a party other than the present landowner,at the request or concurrence of the Forest Service, assembles and managesa land exchange acceptable to the United States, for the benefit of thepresent landowner. A <T3>determination of approximately equal value </T3>is a statement by anauthorized forest officer which documents that the Federal and non-Federallands proposed for exchange have approximately equal values.<T3>Fair market value </T3>is the sum of money or terms equivalent to money,for which in all probability a property would be sold by a knowledgeableowner who is willing but not obligated to sell, to a knowledgeable purchaserwho is willing but not obligated to buy. A <T3>formal proposal </T3>for a land exchange is written, identifies thepotential Federal and non-Federal lands, and identifies the ownership orother authority of a non-Federal party to convey the non-Federal lands.<T3>Hazardous substances </T3>are those substances designated under EnvironmentalProtection Agency regulations at 40 CFR part 302.<T3>Highest and best use </T3>is the reasonable and probable legal use,or combination of reasonable and probable legal uses, that as of the dateof valuation are most likely to produce the greatest net return. An <T3>interest in land </T3>is a partial or undivided right in real propertythat is less than the complete fee or estate. <T3>Lands </T3>means any land or interests held in land. <T3>National forest land status </T3>refers to the condition or type ofownership that applies to a given parcel of land within the national forests,as determined by the method by which the land became part of the NationalForest System.<T3>National Forest System, </T3>as defined in the Act of August 17, 1974(16 U.S.C. 1609), includes all national forest lands reserved or withdrawnfrom the public domain of the United States; all national forest landsacquired through purchase, exchange, donation, or other means; the nationalgrasslands and Land Utilization Projects; and other lands, waters, or intereststherein which are administered by the Forest Service or are designatedfor administration through the Forest Service as a part of the System.An <T3>outstanding interest </T3>is a right or interest in property held bya third party other than the present landowner. A <T3>qualified appraiser </T3>is an individual who, as determined by theForest Service, has the knowledge and experience necessary to competentlycomplete an appraisal assignment. <T3>Relative values </T3>is a term used to describe the relationship betweenthe values of properties on each side of an exchange transaction in whichthere is compensation for exchange processing costs assumed by other thanthe party responsible for those costs. Such values are distinguished fromappraised values, which may have formed the basis for the initial valuationof the properties, but to which administrative adjustments may have occurredoutside of the appraisal process, in compensation for costs of one partyassumed by the other party.A <T3>reservation </T3>is a right created by the grantor in an instrumentof conveyance by which the grantor retains some right, interest, or profitin the estate granted. <T3>Secretary </T3>means the Secretary of Agriculture.<T3>Segregation </T3>means the removal for a limited period, subject tovalid existing rights, of a specified area of National Forest System landreserved from the public domain for national forest purposes from the operationof the public land laws, including the mining and mineral leasing laws.A <T3>statement of value </T3>is an informal appraisal report that documentsan estimate of value and contains only the conclusions reached in the appraiser'sinvestigation and analysis. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 254.3</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Requirements. </ITAG>The following requirements apply to exchanges of National Forest Systemlands: (a) <T3>Eligibility of parties. </T3>Lands can be exchanged only with a non-Federallandowner who is a citizen of the United States or a corporation whichis subject to the laws of a State or of the United States. Lands cannotbe exchanged with a Member of Congress (18 U.S.C. 431). (b) <T3>Lands available for exchange. </T3>The Forest Service will emphasizeexchanges that implement and are consistent with land and resource managementplanning direction and objectives for a particular national forest. Theauthorized forest officer must find that the exchange will not result inan overall decrease in public values or the ability to meet National ForestSystem management objectives. In any exchange, the authorized forest officermust reserve such rights or retain such interests as are needed to protectthe public interest or shall otherwise restrict the use of National ForestSystem lands or partial interests to be exchanged, as appropriate. (c) <T3>Determination of public interest. </T3>An exchange must be found tobe in the overall public interest. When considering if the public interestwill be served, the authorized forest officer shall give full considerationto the opportunity to achieve better Federal land management and to theneeds of State and local residents, including but not limited to, suchneeds as a sound economy, community expansion, recreational opportunities,food, fiber, minerals, and fish and wildlife. (d) <T3>Same-State exchanges. </T3>Lands transferred out of Federal ownershipin an exchange must be located in the same State as the non-Federal landconveyed to the United States, unless specifically exempt by terms of anexchange authority. (e) <T3>Value of lands. </T3>The lands or interests in lands involved in anexchange must be equal in value or equalized by cash payment, pursuantto paragraph (e)(1) of this section; unless a waiver of cash equalizationis authorized, as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section; or unlessthe exchange is conducted under the approximately equal value provisionsof andSection; 254.8 of this subpart. (1) <T3>Cash equalization. </T3>An amount not to exceed 25 percent of the valueof the involved Federal lands may be paid by either party to equalize thevalues in a land exchange. There are no limits on the amount of cash equalizationin exchanges made pursuant to the Sisk Act of December 4, 1967 (16 U.S.C.484a). (2) <T3>Waiver of cash equalization. </T3>When the Forest Service determinesthat the public interest would be better served and that an exchange willbe expedited, the parties may agree that the authorized forest officermay waive a cash equalization payment by the United States, of up to 3percent of the value of the involved Federal lands, not to exceed $15,000.However, the authorized forest officer shall not waive a cash equalizationpayment to the United States.(f) <T3>Future use of exchanged Federal lands.</T3> The use or developmentof lands or interests in lands conveyed out of Federal ownership becomesubject to the laws, regulations, and zoning authorities of State and localgoverning bodies. Except for reservations or restrictions imposed on futureuses within the conveyance document, the future use of lands conveyed intonon-Federal ownership shall be determined by State and local governmentsresponsible for regulating land use. However, the intended use must notbe in conflict with management objectives on adjacent National Forest Systemland and must be compatible with local zoning requirements.(g) <T3>Encumbrances on Federal use.</T3> Lands conveyed to the United Statescannot be encumbered by reservations or outstanding interests that wouldunduly interfere with their use and management as part of the NationalForest System.(h) <T3>Reserved rights.</T3> Reservations by the non-Federal owner are subjectto the appropriate rules and regulations of the Secretary as set forthin 36 CFR 251.14 through 251.19 for such reserved rights, except upon aspecial finding by the Forest Service.(i) <T3>Hazardous substances.</T3> When hazardous substances are known to havebeen stored for one year or more, or are known to have been released ordisposed of on Federal lands involved in an exchange, the Forest Serviceshall provide notice to the other parties in accordance with current EnvironmentalProtection Agency regulations. That notice may be included in a Statementof Intent, an exchange agreement, or some other acceptable document. TheForest Service shall determine if there are deposits of hazardous substanceson the non-Federal land involved in an exchange and reach an agreementon responsibility for control action with the non-Federal party prior toentering into a binding exchange agreement or accepting title to non-Federallands. The non-Federal landowner must notify the Forest Service of anyknowledge of hazardous substances on the non-Federal land pursuant to andSection;254.4of this subpart, or must certify the absence of any knowledge of such materialson the land pursuant to andSection;254.13 of this subpart.(j) <T3>Automatic segregation from mining laws.</T3> Under provisions of theAct of October 21, 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1715), as amended by the Act of August20, 1988 (43 U.S.C. 1716), those non-Federal lands acquired in exchangefor Federal lands reserved from the public domain for national forest purposesautomatically shall be segregated from operation of the public land laws,including the mining and mineral leasing laws, for 90 days after acceptanceof title by the United States. At the end of the 90-day period, withoutfurther action to permanently withdraw the lands, they automatically willbe open to operation of the public land laws and to entry under the miningand mineral leasing laws.(k) <T3>Boundary extensions.</T3> Lands acquired under the authority of theWeeks Act of March 1, 1911, as amended (16 U.S.C. 516), which are nearor adjoining existing national forest boundaries and total no more than3,000 acres in each case, automatically shall be included within a WeeksAct boundary extension encompassing those lands (7 CFR 2.42).(l) <T3>Special review and approval.</T3> Land acquisitions of $150,000 ormore in value made under the authority of the Weeks Act of March 1, 1911,as amended (16 U.S.C. 516), must be submitted to Congress for oversight,pursuant to the Act of October 22, 1976, as amended (16 U.S.C. 521b). Landacquisitions of $250,000 or more in value, made under Weeks Act authority,must also be submitted to the Secretary for approval, except as indicatedin this paragraph. Minor and insignificant changes in land acquisitionproposals need not be resubmitted for congressional oversight or approvalby the Secretary. Land acquisitions specifically mandated by legislationshall be exempt from Secretarial approval or congressional oversight, unlessotherwise specified.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;254.4 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Initiating an exchange.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Proposals.</T3> Exchanges may be initiated by a non-Federal landowner,an agent of a landowner, a broker, a third party, a non-Federal publicagency, or the Forest Service. Initial exchange proposals made to the ForestService should be directed to the District Ranger or Forest Supervisorof the National Forest System unit on which the Federal land is located.A proposal may be accepted, modified, or rejected by either party, at anytime before entering into a binding written exchange agreement.(b) <T3>Agreement to initiate.</T3> Only a Statement of Intent, signed by anauthorized forest officer, constitutes a Forest Service agreement to initiateand pursue an exchange. Failure of an authorized forest officer to rejecta proposal shall not be construed as Forest Service consent to enter intoan exchange.(c) <T3>Statement of Intent.</T3> When the Forest Service and the non-Federalparty decide to pursue the possibility of a land exchange, they must documenttheir intentions in a Statement of Intent.(1) A Statement of Intent shall include, but is not limited to:(i) Certification by the non-Federal party of United States citizenshipor status as a corporation subject to the laws of a State or of the UnitedStates;(ii) Identification of the properties and estates considered for exchange;(iii) Identification of ownership or other authority to make such an exchange;(iv) Identification of any known release, storage, or disposal of hazardoussubstances on involved non-Federal or Federal lands;(v) Assignment of responsibility for performance of required functionsand for payments associated with processing the exchange (andSection;andSection;254.3,254.5);(vi) The scheduled beginning date for appraisals and anticipated date forreview of appraisals, unless deferred under paragraph (d) of this section;(vii) A clear grant of permission by either party to examine and physicallyinspect the lands of the other party.(2) A Statement of Intent shall be a preliminary non-binding agreementto initiate an exchange and may be amended as needed. It may be terminatedat any time by any of the parties, before entering into a binding exchangeagreement.(d) <T3>Appraisal timetable.</T3> Within 90 days after entering into a Statementof Intent, the authorized forest officer and the other parties in an exchangeshall arrange for an appraisal. If not already agreed upon in the Statementof Intent, the completion date and terms of the appraisal must be negotiatedat this time. Such date and terms will be dependent upon the scope, complexity,and priority of the appraisal, and the capability of the Forest Serviceto process and review the proposal.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;254.5</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Responsibilities.</ITAG>(a) <T3>General requirements.</T3> Costs, responsibilities, and requirementsassociated with land exchanges may include, but are not limited to, landsurveys, platting, appraisals, mineral examinations, timber cruises, titlesearches, title curative actions, cultural resource surveys and mitigation,hazardous substance surveys and controls, curing deficiencies preventinghighest and best use of the land, conducting public hearings, assemblageof brokered multiple-parcel exchanges, arbitration, or other costs to complywith laws, regulations, and policies applicable to exchange transactions.Some costs and responsibilities traditionally rest with certain partiesof an exchange, some are typically shared, while others are negotiatedin each case, subject to the needs of the Forest Service.(b) <T3>Assumption of costs without compensation.</T3> While generally, eachparty will pay the expenses normally associated with processing their ownlands in a land exchange, the parties in an exchange may agree that eitherparty will assume without compensation, all or part of certain costs, responsibilities,or requirements that are ordinarily borne by the other party. However,an authorized forest officer shall decide to assume costs normally borneby the non-Federal party only on an exceptional basis, when it is clearlyin the public interest and in the best interest of consummating an exchange.(c) <T3>Compensation for costs assumed by the non-Federal party.</T3> The ForestService may, in special circumstances, determine that it is in the publicinterest to consummate an exchange and compensate the non-Federal partyfor assuming costs, responsibilities, or requirements which would ordinarilybe borne by the Forest Service. Such compensation shall be agreed uponin advance and shall be made by adjusting the relative values involvedin an exchange.(1) In order to compensate a non-Federal party for assuming costs, responsibilities,or requirements normally borne by the Forest Service, an authorized forestofficer must find that all of the following conditions exist or will resultfrom the compensation:(i) Resulting landownership patterns will not be disadvantageous to theGovernment.(ii) The exchange will result in exceptional public benefit.(iii) Consummation will be expedited for a land exchange needed to protectcultural resource sites, protect adjacent National Forest System landsfrom external degradation, protect or enhance important recreational opportunities,protect critical wildlife or fish habitat, protect threatened, endangered,or sensitive species habitat, or protect other national forest resourcevalues.(iv) There will be no resultant change in the appraised values of the landsinvolved in the exchange.(v) The amount of compensation is reasonable and accurately reflects theapproximate value of any costs or services provided, or any responsibilitiesor requirements assumed.(vi) No other means of meeting the exchange processing costs, responsibilities,or requirements of the Forest Service are available or practicable.(2) Relative value adjustments reflecting compensation for costs may resultin acreage adjustments of included Federal or non-Federal land, or cashequalization payments. Compensation shall not exceed 25 percent of thevalue of the involved Federal lands. Only those costs that are set forthand agreed to in the Statement of Intent will be considered for compensation.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;254.6</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Legal description of properties.</ITAG>Lands proposed for exchange must be properly described and locatable underthe survey laws and standards of the United States and the State in whichlocated. Any survey required is the responsibility of each party unlessotherwise negotiated and documented in a Statement of Intent, or subsequentamendments.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;254.7 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Appraisals. </ITAG>(a) <T3>Uniform standards</T3>. The fundamental appraisal standards for NationalForest System land exchanges are as set forth in the ``Uniform AppraisalStandards for Federal Land Acquisitions,'' as amended, an Interagency LandAcquisition Conference publication (May, 1973). Those standards are furthersupplemented by Standards 1, 2, and 3 of the ``Uniform Standards of ProfessionalAppraisal Practice,'' as published by the Appraisal Foundation. If anyparts of the latter standards conflict with the first set of standards,those parts of the latter standards shall be disregarded and the applicableparts of the ``Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land Acquisitions''shall govern. The same appraisal standards shall be used in appraisingboth the Federal and the non-Federal lands involved in an exchange. (b) <T3>Appraisal of Federal lands</T3>. Federal lands shall be appraised underthe assumption that they are already in non-Federal ownership and are zonedin accordance to their highest and best use. (c) <T3>Qualified appraisers</T3>. Appraisals to estimate fair market valuemust be made by qualified Forest Service staff or private-sector fee appraisers.Criteria for qualification of private-sector fee appraisers shall be determinedby the Forest Service, based on the requirements and complexity of theappraisal assignment, and listed in the contract for an appraisal. Requirementsfor qualification of Forest Service staff appraisers are as described inForest Service Manual Chapter 5410. (d) <T3>Brokered exchanges</T3>. Brokered exchanges shall be utilized wheneverpractical to facilities landownership adjustments and reduce costs. Whena broker, agent, or third party proposes an exchange of two or more propertieswhich have been assembled to meet Forest Service landownership adjustmentgoals, special appraisal instructions may apply. The intent of such specialinstruction is that the appraisal process will not penalize an agent foran assembly. Multiple-parcel Federal lands involved in brokered exchangesshall be subject to the same valuation techniques as the non-Federal lands.(e) <T3>Current appraisals</T3>. Appraisals must be current, dated no morethan one year prior to entering into a binding exchange agreement. However,market conditions may indicate that a shorter period is appropriate. Whenan exchange agreement is executed, approved values shall remain effectiveuntil consummation of the exchange. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;254.8 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Approximately equal value exchanges. </ITAG>(a) <T3>Requirements</T3>. The Forest Service may make a determination of approximatelyequal values without a formal appraisal report only when: (1) It is in the public interest to expedite the consummation of a particularexchange; (2) The value of the involved Federal land does not exceed $150,000; (3) The exchange properties have readily apparent and substantially similarelements of value; (4) There are no significant elements of value requiring complex analysis,such as, but not limited to, high-valued minerals, high-valued improvements,or high-valued water frontage; and (5) a qualified Forest Service staff appraiser has prepared a Statementof Value to document the Federal land value. (b) <T3>Determination of value</T3>. Approximately equal values shall be determinedby comparing and evaluating the elements of value on lands or interestsin lands to be exchanged. Elements of value to be considered include, butare not limited to, highest and best use of the land, size, shape, location,physical attributes, functional utility, proximity of other similar sites,and amenities. Findings that parcels are approximately equal in value shallbe documented in a Determination of Approximately Equal Value approvedby an authorized forest officer. (c) <T3>Appraisal standards</T3>. Statements of Value must meet the same appraisalstandards as detailed appraisal reports. It is the Forest Service staffappraiser's responsibility to maintain full documentation of the data supportinga Statement of Value and to make it available for review upon request.(d) <T3>Current statement of value</T3>. A Statement of Value must be current,within one year prior to the date of entering into a binding exchange agreement.However, market conditions may indicate that a shorter period is appropriate.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;254.9 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Arbitration of valuation. </ITAG>(a) <T3>Agreement on valuation</T3>. The Forest Service and non-Federal exchangeparties should attempt to reach agreement as to the valuation of an exchange,before resorting to arbitration. Such agreement may be reached throughbargaining, pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section. (b) <T3>Bargaining</T3>. If the Forest Service and other parties cannot agreeto accept the findings of the initial appraisal or appraisals, they maybargain to select one of the following methods to determine the valuesof the properties involved in an exchange: (1) Additional appraisals by either or both parties; (2) Agreement on an additional appraisal to be done by a mutually acceptablequalified third appraiser; (3) Agreement to submit the disputed appraisals to a review by a mutuallyacceptable qualified third appraiser; or (4) Some other acceptable and commonly recognized practice for determiningvalues. The final determination of value must be acceptable to the ForestService, for an exchange to proceed. (c) <T3>Submission for arbitration</T3>. If the valuation of an exchange cannotbe agreed upon within 180 days after appraisals are submitted to the authorizedforest officer for review and approval, the appraisals may be submittedto an arbitrator appointed by the Forest Service from a list provided bythe American Arbitration Association, for arbitration in accordance withthe Real Estate Valuation Arbitration Rules of that organization. (d) <T3>Election of arbitration</T3>. Failure to voluntarily negotiate termsgenerally will be grounds to discontinue an exchange. Arbitration shallbe considered as a last resort in negotiating terms of an exchange andshall be used only when the Forest Service determines that there are extenuatingpublic interest reasons for proceeding with an exchange. (e) <T3>Arbitration procedures and requirements. </T3>When arbitration is utilized,the following procedures will apply:  (1) Upon receipt of a notice of intent to arbitrate, the authorized forestofficer shall appoint a single arbitrator from a list provided by the AmericanArbitration Association.  (2) Arbitration shall be limited to the disputed valuation of a proposedexchange, and an arbitrator's award decision shall be limited to the valueestimate(s) of the contested appraisal(s). An award decision shall notinclude recommendations regarding the nature of a proposed exchange. Anaward decision shall not infringe upon the authority of the Secretary tomake all decisions regarding management of National Forest System landsand to make public interest determinations.  (3) An award decision reached by an arbitrator shall be the effective valuationfor a period not to exceed two years from the date of the decision andshall be binding only if an exchange is consummated. Any adjustment ormodification of an exchange which results in changes of the values arbitratedwill nullify an arbitrator's award decision.  (4) Within 30 days after delivery of an arbitrator's award decision, eachparty in an exchange shall notify in writing all other parties of theirintent to proceed with an exchange with the values as arbitrated, or tomodify an exchange as a result of the arbitration findings or other factors,or to withdraw from an exchange. Until the parties enter into a bindingexchange agreement, any party may elect to withdraw from an exchange atany time during the exchange or arbitration process.  (f) <T3>Suspension of time limits. </T3>Time frames and deadlines in paragraphs(c) and (e)(4) of this section, and in andSection;254.4(d) of this subpart,may be modified or suspended at any time, upon agreement of the parties. (g) <T3>Termination of exchange. </T3>Notwithstanding the provisions of thissection, if it appears at any time during the exchange process, beforeentering into a binding exchange agreement, that further negotiations wouldbe futile or that it would be administratively impractical to continue,an authorized forest officer may terminate an exchange.  <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;254.10  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Publication of proposed exchanges.  </ITAG>(a) <T3>Publication of notice. </T3>The Forest Service shall publish a noticefor each proposed exchange once a week for four consecutive weeks in newspapersof general circulation in the counties in which the Federal and non-Federallands or interests proposed for exchange are located. An exchange noticewill be published at the point when the potential lands that may be includedin an exchange have been identified in a Statement of Intent.  (b) <T3>Purpose of notice. </T3>The purposes of an exchange notice are:  (1) To apprise the public of an exchange proposal in a timely fashion; (2) To allow anyone having a claim to the lands to notify the appropriateforest officer and present evidence supporting their claim; and  (3) To afford an opportunity for those with comments to submit their viewsto the Forest Service.  (c) <T3>Response deadline. </T3>All claims and comments must be made in writingand postmarked or delivered within 15 days of the final publication ofa notice, to be assured of consideration in the environmental analysisof a proposed exchange.  (d) <T3>Republication requirements. </T3>If some of the lands described ina published exchange notice are excluded from the final exchange agreement,it is not necessary to republish the final land descriptions, as long asthe included lands were substantially identified in the published notice.Minor corrections of legal descriptions, small additions of exchange lands,and other insignificant changes also do not require republication.  <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;254.11  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Approval of exchanges.  </ITAG>(a) <T3>Environmental analysis.</T3> If preliminary negotiations result inconcurrence on an exchange proposal, the Forest Service shall conduct anenvironmental analysis in accordance with the National Environmental PolicyAct of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321), the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations(40 CFR Parts 1500-1508), and the Forest Service Environmental Policy andProcedures (Forest Service Manual Chapter 1950 and Forest Service Handbook1909.15). In making this analysis, the Forest Service shall consider timelywritten comments received in response to the published exchange notice. (b) <T3>Notice of decision. </T3>The Forest Service shall provide copies ofthe decision documents to the exchange parties, to all parties who filedwritten objections, and to all known parties with an expressed or inherentinterest in an exchange.
