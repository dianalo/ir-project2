Based on the microregionalization principle itis designed to eliminate many of the inconsistencies found in broaderand more general assay methods which are unable to track or incorporatesmall heterogeneities in rock properties. In this paper it is appliedto field engineering geology experiments at five different hydroelectricplants where the preliminary survey work was carried out with the participationof the author. Rocks of different origin, composition, strength and geologichistory were included in the analysis and in almost 200 deformation andshear tests.</TEXT></DOC>
