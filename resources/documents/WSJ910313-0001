The guidelines are largely designed to head off threatenedlegislation that would force accountants to report fraud toregulators. But Rep. Ron Wyden called them a &quot;big stall&quot; andsaid he would introduce such legislation in a month or two.</LP><TEXT>   Rep. Wyden, who has long criticized accountants for faultyauditing of financial data, lambasted the proposed guidelineson &quot;internal controls&quot; as being too weak, soon after theywere issued by five key accounting organizations. The OregonDemocrat is a member of the subcommittee on oversight andinvestigations of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.The subcommittee has held 25 hearings since 1985 on whetheraccountants are protecting the public against financialfraud.   Rep. Wyden said that the proposed guidelines issued in a350-page document on corporate internal controls &quot;aren't evenon a radar screen as far as identifying ways to prevent thefinancial frauds that have been perpetrated at the thrifts,banks and other companies over the past decade.&quot;   The proposed guidelines offer suggestions to corporationson preventing fraud and improper use of assets. Someaccountants say the final proposal is only marginally changedfrom the initial draft several months ago, which theycriticized as lacking teeth.   Mr. Wyden said he plans to introduce legislation inCongress to require outside auditors to report fraud toregulators and to report on the adequacy of internal controlsat companies they audit. Internal controls are systems andchecklists that companies use to prevent fraud, improperfinancial reporting and the waste or theft of assets.   Last year, a similar bill sponsored by Rep. Wyden andbacked by the American Institute of Certified PublicAccountants passed in the House but failed to win Senateapproval.   Vincent O'Reilly, deputy chairman of Coopers andamp; Lybrand, amajor accounting firm, and head of the 10-member team thatprepared the proposed guidelines for the five-organizationgroup, disagreed strongly with Rep. Wyden.   Mr. O'Reilly retorted that the purpose of the guidelinesis to spell out a &quot;framework for internal controls&quot; and&quot;provide an environment where problems of fraud can beidentified by management.&quot; At a news conference to introducethe guidelines, Mr. O'Reilly and other accounting officialsconceded that the proposed guidelines would be voluntaryrather than mandatory. They said the guidelines would beissued in the fall after a three-month comment period.   The Securities and Exchange Commission in 1988 issued aproposal that would require management to report on theeffectiveness of a company's internal control system. JamesDoty, the SEC's general counsel, said that this proposal isstill pending but won't be voted on by the commission until&quot;we see the outcome&quot; of any legislation by Rep. Wyden.   Mr. Doty said the SEC hasn't any official position on theinternal-control guidelines just issued by the fiveaccounting organizations. &quot;While many companies involve theiroutside auditors in evaluating their internal controls, somecompanies don't do this voluntarily,&quot; he added. &quot;At thispoint, I can't predict which way the SEC will go, becausethere are cost-benefit questions involved.&quot;   The organizations issuing the internal-controls proposalare the American Accounting Association, the AmericanInstitute of Certified Public Accountants, the FinancialExecutives Institute, the Institute of Internal Auditors andthe National Association of Accountants.</TEXT></DOC>
