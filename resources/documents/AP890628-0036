The lawsuit alleges that David and Robert Martin of Atlanta,escrow agents for the sales, failed to turn over the money betweenOctober 1984 and May 1987.   U.S. Attorney Robert Barr said an audit leading to the lawsuitwas begun in May 1987 and revealed that government losses reached$2.5 million.   Barr and Raymond Buday Jr., the U.S. Department of Housing andUrban Development's regional counsel, said the investigationrevealed that false documents were filed to mask the non-payment.   The Martins' lawyers contend the money was paid but cannot betraced in Washington because of sloppy government bookkeeping.   The Martins are not charged with a crime.   ``The nature of the case lent itself to a civil suit,'' Barr saidTuesday.   He said there are related criminal investigations pending, butdeclined to say if they involved the Martins.   The homes in question were repossessed by HUD after ownersdefaulted on Federal Housing Administration loans.   There are several investigations into missing funds includingmajor ones in Indianapolis, Denver, Philadelphia and the Washington,D.C., area. Investigators say the cases appear unrelated.   Critics contend the problems stem from incompetence andinfluence-peddling at high levels of HUD during the Reaganadministration.</TEXT></DOC>
