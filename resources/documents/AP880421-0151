The United States is in touch with the government of Algeria,where the hijacking ended Wednesday, as well as with Kuwaitiauthorities. Most of the 31 hostages were Kuwaitis, and thehijackers had demanded the release of 17 prisoners held by Kuwaitfor terrorist bombings.   State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said the UnitedStates does not know whether a deal was struck with the hostages.   ``We remain unaware of specific arrangements which were workedout to lead to the end of the hijacking,'' she said.   Kuwait reportedly agreed to commute the death sentences of threeof the 17 Moslems whose released was being demanded by thehijackers in return for the hostages' release.   The hijackers were reportedly flown to Lebanon.   ``We don't know where the hijackers are. We remain in touch withthe government of Algeria on this matter,'' Mrs. Oakley said. ``Weare also in touch with a number of governments that share ourconcerns about bringing terrorists to justice.''   ``The United States will not rest until the terrorists, themurderers, the hijackers are brought to justice. Our objective isto make sure they do not go unpunished,'' she said.   Mrs. Oakley said the United States is examining the possibilityof filing charges against the hijackers because one of the hostagesholds dual U.S.-Egyptian citizenship.</TEXT></DOC>
