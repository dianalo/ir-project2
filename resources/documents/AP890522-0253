(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Testimony began Monday on a federallawsuit filed in 1973 alleging that the Navy discriminated againstblack civilian workers in promotions at Jacksonville Naval AirStation.   U.S. District Judge Howell W. Melton is hearing the non-jurytrial, which may involve up to 450 witnesses and 4,000 exhibits inthe case that became a class-action suit after it was filed.   Attorneys for both sides estimated the trial may take up to 12weeks. Melton said if it is not over by the end of June, he willhave to recess it until September because of other court business.   The lawsuit was filed by six blacks in 1973 after theircomplaints were rejected by their bosses. One of the six workershas died since the lawsuit was filed.   Ten years after the case went to court, it was declared a classaction, with the outcome potentially affecting 1,200 to 1,700blacks who work or have worked at the Navy Aviation Depot, formerlythe Naval Air Rework Facility.   To win, lawyers for the NAACP Legal Defense and Education FundInc. must prove there was a sweeping pattern of sometimes subtlepersonnel decisions that promoted white workers ahead of morequalified blacks.   ``We think the promotion process is a largely subjectiveprocedure. When you have that kind of subjective decision-making,discrimination can enter the process,'' said Clyde Murphy, one ofthe lawyers with the National Association for the Advancement ofColored People.   The Navy has denied any discrimination and also has defended itssystem for evaluating and promoting civilian workers.   If Melton decides the Navy has discriminated, another trialwould be needed to determine which employees were treated unfairlyand how they should be compensated. The plaintiffs in a subsequentlawsuit could seek back pay and promotions, Murphy said.   ``It's a big case, and when you litigate against the federalgovernment, they have a lot of resources,'' he said.   A variety of reasons are behind the 15-year delay since theoriginal 1974 trial date.   A major issue has been the changing nature of how civil rightsemployment laws apply to the federal government. That resulted inyears of delay until the U.S. Supreme Court clarified theapplication of the law, Murphy said.   In addition, the two sides haggled for years over whatinformation they were required to give each other. Governmentattorneys ``aggressively litigated'' the case, Murphy said.   And for several years, only one federal judge was available inJacksonville and he was required to put criminal cases ahead ofcivil actions.</TEXT></DOC>
