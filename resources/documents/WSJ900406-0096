Minister of ForestsKarl Stack said: &quot;We're challenging the internationalcommunity to stop pontificating. We've told them, `You do theright thing and we'll do the right thing.'&quot; A spokesman forAustralia's Foreign Affairs Minister Gareth Evans saidAustralia &quot;stands ready to support the moratorium. It's justa question of how much.&quot; The moratorium, which will start inJuly, would mean a loss equivalent to about $73 million inpotential earnings, Mr. Stack said.                                                                                                          A VISIT TO NAMIBIA                                                                                                          The United Nations Council for Namibia, set up in 1967 toadminister the territory but never allowed to set foot there,will finally visit Namibia, three weeks after it attainedindependence.

The paper saidauto makers produced 54,500 vehicles in the first two monthsof the year but sold only 44,390, down 35% from the sameperiod in 1989. The daily said the government has allotted$80.9 million in credit to help stimulate the auto market.The market has collapsed under a 20-month-long austeritydrive that has limited purchases by government institutions,the industry's main customers.                                                                                                          `YEAR OF THE CATASTROPHES'                                                                                                          Zurich's Swiss Reinsurance Co., calling 1989 the &quot;year ofthe catastrophes,&quot; estimates in a new study that variousdisasters around the world caused insured damage of at least$13.3 billion last year.
