As scraps of the cabinet list were dropped by deputies in the Parliament's entry hall, it appeared that Solidarity would take less than half the portfolios for itself. The Peasants Party, without which Solidarity can't govern, would get four, and the Democrats two.    But the Communist Party, as a condition for giving way to Solidarity, will retain the levers of coercion: the ministries of defense and interior. While the Communists remain outside the government coalition, they evidently have also been granted at least three other posts. These were said to include transportation, giving the party more control over strategic hardware, and a much-reduced but still important central-planning office. The Communists are expected to receive a deputy prime minister's appointment as well.    Parliament will hold hearings on the proposed cabinet over the weekend, and vote on confirmation early next week.    The Communists apparently lost their bid to run the Foreign Ministry, however. In a compromise that favors Solidarity, the job reportedly will go to a Roman Catholic intellectual, Krzysztof Skubiszewski, who has served on an advisory council to the head of the Polish church. He has no political ties. As a sop, but an economically important one, the Communists were offered the ministry of foreign trade, Solidarity deputies said.    Solidarity will shoulder much of the rest of the burden of extracting the economy from three decades of Stalinism and one decade of failed reform. Mr. Mazowiecki's choices seem to lean toward liberals who favor a free market, seasoned by social conscience, rather than toward backers of a welfare state.    A 42-year old economist, Lezek Balcerowicz, was said to be his pick as minister of finance and as deputy prime minister overseeing the economy. The prime minister was expected to name as Industry Minister Tadeusz Syryjczyk, a member of a Krakow society for the promotion of private enterprise. The head of a similar group in Warsaw, Aleksander Paszynski, would take charge of housing. And a longtime Solidarity adviser, Witold Trzeciakowski, would chair a new council of economic advisers.    The main sticking point last night was over the question of agricultural policy. The Peasant Party insisted on filling the job with the same man who has overseen agriculture under Communist rule, Kazimierz Olesiak. Mr. Mazowiecki reportedly will name another Peasant Party member of his own choice. Meanwhile, Rural Solidarity, an independent group closely related to Solidarity, was demanding the agriculture portfolio, too.    &quot;The Peasant Party, which counts the least in the countryside, got a deputy premiership and several portfolios and we, the most important, don't get anything,&quot; Jozef Slisz, the Rural Solidarity head, wrote in yesterday's Solidarity newspaper. But he said his organization won't &quot;sulk,&quot; and will vote with Solidarity anyway. </TEXT></DOC>
