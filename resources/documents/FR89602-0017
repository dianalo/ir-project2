The final rule implements the relicensing provisions of ECPA by establishingprocedures for the processing of applications for licenses to operate existinghydroelectric facilities when their current licenses are approaching expiration.The final rule provides for the acceleration of license expiration datesunder certain circumstances. It provides for potential applicants to haveaccess to existing sites to make studies necessary to prepare their applications.The final rule establishes a three-stage resource agency consultation processto be followed by potential applicants prior to filing their applications,and provides a mechanism whereby   the Director of the Commission's Officeof Hydropower Licensing will resolve disputes between potential applicantsand resource agencies that arise during the pre-filing consultation process.The final rule requires potential applicants to allow the public to attendthe joint meeting at the beginning of the agency consultation process,to solicit the public's comments on relevant resource issues that shouldbe addressed. The final rule specifies that an existing licensee filing an applicationfor new license in conjunction with a new entity will not be consideredan existing licensee for the purposes of the insignificant differencesprovision of section 15 of the Federal Power Act. Finally, the final ruleclarifies that the licensing proceeding following the expiration of a minorlicense where standard provisions have been waived is a relicensing proceedingsuch that municipal preference is not applicable.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>This rule is effective July 3, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2> John Whittaker, Office of theGeneral Counsel, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North CapitolStreet, NE., Washington, DC 20426, (202) 357-8033.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>In addition to publishing the fulltext of this document in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, the Commission also provides all interestedpersons an opportunity to inspect or copy the contents of this documentduring normal business hours in Room 1000 at the Commission's Headquarters,825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426.

Introduction</ITAG>The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) is revising its regulationsgoverning the relicensing of hydroelectric power projects. The revisionsimplement, in part, provisions added to the Federal Power Act (FPA) \1\<NOTE/> by the Electric Consumers Protection Act of 1986 (ECPA).\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ 16 U.S.C. 791a-825r (1982 and Supp. 1988).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Pub. L. No. 99-495, 100 Stat. 1243 (Oct. l6, 1986).<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Background </ITAG>In ECPA, Congress substantially amended the FPA to restructure the statutoryframework for the consideration and processing of applications for relicensefor hydroelectric power projects subject to sections 14 and 15 of the FPA.ECPA clarified that a municipality is not entitled to a preference at relicensing,enumerated a number of factors the Commission must specifically considerin acting on relicense applications, and specified the standard the Commissionmust use in choosing among competing applications. In addition, ECPA establishednew procedural requirements for the filing and processing of applicationsfor new license. On May 24, 1988, the Commission issued a notice of proposed rulemaking(NOPR) in which it proposed to revise its regulations to incorporate theamendments to the relicensing provisions of the FPA made by ECPA.\3\<NOTE/> The Commission proposed a process for pre-filing consultationwith resource agencies, revised requirements regarding the filing and contentof applications for new licenses, and procedures for processing and considerationof applications for new licenses. The NOPR also proposed revisions to theprocedures governing applications for nonpower licenses and exemptionsfrom licensing upon expiration of existing licenses, and revisions to theregulations for applications for  licenses for minor water power projectsand minor part water power projects with expiring licenses not subjectto sections 14 and 15 of the FPA.\4\<NOTE/> Finally, the NOPR proposed new provisions regarding accelerationof license expiration dates, site access for potential competing applicants,and the handling of projects where no timely applications for new licensesare filed. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Hydroelectric Relicensing Regulations Under the FederalPower Act, 53 FR 21,844 (June 10, 1988), IV FERC Stats. andamp; Regs. andpara;32,461 (May 24, 1988). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ As discussed in Part IV.A., <T3>infra</T3>, a minor water power project is one which would have a totalinstalled capacity of 2,000 horsepower or less. A minor part water powerproject is one that includes only a portion of a complete unit of development.The Commission received 53 timely comments on the NOPR.\5\<NOTE/> In addition, late comments were filed by five entities.\6\<NOTE/> Finally, comments replying to statements made in the initialcomments on the NOPR were filed by 14 entities.\7\<NOTE/> The Commission has reviewed all of these comments in developingthe final rule. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ <T3>See </T3>Appendix A. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ Columbia Commission, Warm Springs Tribes, Great LakesCommission, The Department of Commerce, and the Department of the Interior.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ Alabama Power, EEI, Friends of the Earth, Georgia Power,Idaho Power, Long Lake, Mid-Columbia, Nebraska Power, Northern CaliforniaAgency, Public Pool, Douglas County PUD, Rochester Gas, Wisconsin Department,and Wisconsin Public Service. All significant comments and revisions in the regulations are discussedin detail in Part IV, <T3>infra</T3>. Following is a summary of the final rule's treatment ofmajor subject areas.  <T3>Acceleration.</T3> The final rule provides for the acceleration oflicense expiration dates for any legitimate interest including, but notlimited to, installation of new capacity. <T3>Access.</T3> The final rule expands both the purposes for which accessmust be provided and the types of compensation to which existing licenseeswill be entitled for providing access to potential competitors. In addition,the final rule specifies that certain disputes regarding access are subjectto resolution by the Director of the Office of Hydropower Licensing. <T3>Consultation.</T3> The final rule adopts the three-stage resource agencyconsultation process generally as proposed in the NOPR. However, the finalrule expands some of the timing provisions of the process and specifiesthat not all meetings between a potential applicant and a resource agencyhave to include all other agencies. Also, the scope of the process wherebythe Director of the Office of Hydropower Licensing will resolve disputesbetween potential applicants and resource agencies is expanded to includeany matter arising during firststage consultation and to permit agenciesto initiate the resolution process. The final rule also clarifies that the failure of a resource agency totimely participate in a consultation step will not preclude it from engagingin subsequent consultation steps. The final rule clarifies that the confidentialityprovisions of the NOPR regarding pre-filing submissions to the Commissionapply only if a request for confidential treatment under one of the testsof the Freedom of Information Act is made in accordance with existing Commissionregulations. Also, the rule clarifies that materials are protected fromdisclosure only until the related application is filed. Finally, the final rule contains provisions requiring potential applicantsto allow the public to attend the joint meeting at the beginning of theagency consultation process to solicit the public's comments on relevantresource issues that should be addressed. <T3>Procedures.</T3> The final rule does not adopt the NOPR's proposedprohibition on the filing of applications prior to 30 months before theexpiration dates of existing licenses. The final rule also specifies thatdeadlines for correcting deficiencies and filing final amendments willbe established on a case-by-case basis. <T3>Standards and Factors.</T3> The final rule eliminates potential confusionregarding the factors the Commission will consider at relicensing by simplyreferring to the appropriate statutory provision. The final rule also clarifiesthat the Commission, in examining an existing licensee's track record,will consider both compliance matters and actions the licensee has takenwhich affect the public. <T3>Joint Applicants.</T3> The final rule specifies that an existing licenseefiling an application for new license in conjunction with a new entitywill not be considered an existing licensee for purposes of the insignificantdifferences provision of section 15 of the FPA. <T3>Minor Licenses.</T3> The final rule adopts the NOPR's provisions regardingthe waiver of certain provisions of the FPA by applicants for minor license.The final rule also clarifies that the licensing proceeding following theexpiration of a minor license where these standard provisions have beenwaived is a relicensing proceeding. Consequently, municipal preferenceis not applicable to the proceeding. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Reporting Burden </ITAG>The public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimatedto average 832 hours per response for water power projects having morethan five megawatt (MW) capacity and 178 hours per response for water powerprojects having five MW capacity or less, including the time for reviewinginstructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintainingthe data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information.Send comments regarding these burden estimates or any other aspect of thiscollection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden,to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street,NE., Washington, DC 20426 [Attention: Michael Miller, Office of ManagementSystems and Analysis, (202) 357-9205]; and to the Office of Informationand Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC20503 [Attention: Desk Officer for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission].<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Discussion </ITAG>A. Applicability of Certain Requirements of Part I of the Federal PowerAct to Applications for Minor Licenses for Water Power Projects A ``minor water power project'' is one that would have a total installedgeneration capacity of 2,000 horsepower (1.5 megawatts) or less.\8\<NOTE/> Under section 10(i) of the FPA,\9\<NOTE/> the Commission has the discretionary authority to waive allbut three provisions of Part I of the FPA when it issues licenses for minorwater power projects.\10\<NOTE/> The Commission has invoked section 10(i) to waive the detailedaccounting and administrative provisions of the FPA for these small projectsbecause these provisions are unnecessary and expensive for the Commissionto administer.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ 18 CFR 4.30(b)(17) (1988). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ 16 U.S.C. 803(i) (1982). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ Section 10(i) prohibits the Commission from waiving the50-year limit on license terms contained in section 6 of the FPA, 16 U.S.C.799 (1982), and the provision regarding the payment of annual charges foruse of lands within Indian reservations contained in section 10(e) of theFPA, 16 U.S.C. 803(e) (1982). Section 10(j) of the FPA, 16 U.S.C. 803(j)(1982 and Supp. 1988), specifies that its provisions cannot be waived pursuantto section 10(i). <ITAG tagnum="28">Section 10(i) also authorizes the Commission to waive provisions ofPart I of the FPA when it issues minor part licenses. However, except fortransmission lines, the Commission no longer issues minor part licenses.</ITAG><T3>See, e.g., </T3>Pacific Gas andamp; Electric Company, 29 F.P.C. 1265,1266 (1963), and Pacific Gas andamp; Electric Company, 56 F.P.C. 994, 1006-08(1976). Traditionally, the Commission has waived the following provisions of PartI of the FPA for minor licenses: (1) The requirement for filing a statementof the actual legitimate costs   of construction of a project;\11\<NOTE/> (2) the requirement that plans affecting navigation be approvedby the Chief of Engineers and the Secretary of the Army;\12\<NOTE/> (3) the provisions requiring maintenance of depreciationand amortization reserves by licensees;\13\<NOTE/> (4) the provision incorporating all of the terms and conditionsof the FPA into the license (insofar as it relates to the terms and conditionsof the FPA that are waived in the license);\14\<NOTE/> (5) the provision requiring reimbursement for storage reservoirsor other headwater improvements that directly benefit the licensee;\15\<NOTE/> and (6) certain provisions regarding rate and securitiesregulation,\16\<NOTE/> temporary Federal use of project facilities,\17\<NOTE/> and contracts to provide power beyond the term of the license.\18\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ Section 4(b) of the FPA, 16 U.S.C. 797(b) (1982). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ Section 4(e) of the FPA, 16 U.S.C. 797(e) (1982). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\13\ Sections 10(c) and 10(d) of the FPA, 16 U.S.C 803(c)and 803(d) (1982). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\14\ Section 6 of the FPA, 16 U.S.C. 799 (1982). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\15\ Section 10(f) of the FPA, 16 U.S.C. 803(f) (1982). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\16\ Sections 19 and 20 of the FPA, 16 U.S.C. 812 and 813(1982). Section 19 vests in the states authority to regulate certain powersales by licensees that are public service corporations. Section 20 vestsin the Commission authority to regulate the issuance of securities by licenseesin certain instances. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\17\ Section 16 of the FPA, 16 U.S.C. 809 (1982). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\18\ Section 22 of the FPA, 16 U.S.C. 815 (1982).Waiver of the above provisions eliminates the requirement to maintain certainaccounts and provide information necessary for net investment determinationsassociated with Federal takeover of licenses, pursuant to section 14 ofthe FPA,\19\<NOTE/> and issuance of new licenses to other than the existing licenseespursuant to section 15 of the FPA.\20\<NOTE/> Therefore, the Commission also has traditionally waived thesetwo latter provisions of Part I of the FPA when it issues licenses forminor projects, except for the portion of section 14 that provides theUnited States and any state or municipality with the right to take overa licensed project at any time by condemnation proceedings upon paymentof just compensation.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\19\ 16 U.S.C. 807 (1982). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\20\ 16 U.S.C. 808 (1982 and Supp. 1988).  The Commission's consistent practice has been to routinely waive sections14 and 15, and the other provisions of Part I of the FPA discussed above,whenever it issues a minor license. However, as discussed in Part IV.P.,<T3>infra</T3>, the NOPR included provisions addressing the filing andprocessing of applications for license for projects with expiring minoror minor part licenses where sections 14 and 15 of the FPA have been waived.Because of the potential significance of these new provisions, the Commissiondetermined that it would be appropriate to replace its routine waiver practicewith a mechanism that would enable applicants for minor licenses, bothfor new projects and existing ones, to indicate whether they wanted theseprovisions of Part I of the FPA waived. Accordingly, the Commission proposedin the NOPR to add a new paragraph (c) to andSection;4.60 of its regulations,\21\<NOTE/> indicating that the Commission would waive the above provisionsof Part I of the FPA when it issued a minor license, unless the applicantindicated in its application that it wanted these provisions applied toits project.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\21\ 18 CFR 4.60 (1988); proposed andSection; 4.60(c).Four entities offered comments on the Commission's proposal to amend andSection;4.60. American Rivers contends that the Commission has not adequately justifiedthe waiver of these provisions. It maintains that the Commission should,at a minimum, impose the requirements that: (1) A licensee file a statementof original cost of construction of the project (arguing that it is easyto prepare and essential to preserve the option of subsequent Federal takeover);(2) the plans of projects that would affect the navigable capacity of navigablewaters be approved by the Chief of Engineers and Secretary of the Army;(3) a licensee pay for headwater benefits; and (4) such licenses remainsubject to sections 14 and 15 of the FPA. Trout Unlimited suggests thatthe provisions be waived only on a case-specific basis after notice ofintent to waive in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, newspaper notice, and notification of appropriateFederal and state agencies by mail. The Department of Commerce opposes the waiver of the referred portionsof FPA sections 6, 10(c), 10(d), 10(f), 15, 16, 19, 20, and 22. It arguesthat the Commission has not adequately evaluated the costs and benefitsof waiving these provisions. Commerce also states that the referenced portionof section 4(e) should not be waived, and questions whether the Commissioncan be assured that these projects will not create navigation problems.Finally, Washington Wildlife questions the waiver of the navigation provisionof section 4(e), and without discussion of its reasons, states that itobjects to the waiver of the other referenced provisions.The Commission believes it is appropriate to continue waiving the above-specifiedprovisions of Part I of the FPA for minor licenses in cases where it isin the public interest to do so and where the applicants do not requestotherwise. The small scale and scope of these projects do not justify thelevel of regulation associated with these provisions or the significantburden on licensees that compliance with these provisions would entail.The Commission is not aware of any problems caused by its existing practiceof waiving these provisions. Congress was fully aware of the Commission'swaiver practice when it enacted legislation in 1962 \22\<NOTE/> to raise the 100 horsepower limit of section 10(i) to thepresent 2,000 horsepower limit.\23\<NOTE/> As discussed elsewhere herein, the provisions to be enactedas part of this final rule provide adequate means for the filing and processingof applications for license for minor water power projects with expiringlicenses not subject to sections 14 and l5 of the FPA.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\22\ Act of September 7, 1962, Pub. L. No. 87-647, 76 Stat.447 (1962).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\23\ <T3>See</T3> H.R. Rep. No. 2241, 87th Cong., 2nd Sess. (1962), <T3>reprinted in</T3> 1962 U.S. Code Cong. andamp; Admin. News at 2375-79:<ITAG tagnum="28">The original Federal Water Power Act in 1920 created the Commissionfor the purpose of licensing hydroelectric developments on the waters ofthe United States over which the Congress has jurisdiction. That act recognized,and its major revision in 1935, the Federal Power Act, continued to recognize,that all of the requirements for licensing a large hydroelectric projectwere not necessary for small projects. * * * </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">*    *    *    *    * </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">As stated by the Commission, some of the detailed requirements thatit now may waive for projects of not more than 100 horsepower and thatit would be authorized by the bill to waive for projects of not more than2,000 horsepower are those relating to the original cost of the project,the annual charges, the establishment of amortization reserves and depreciationreserves, and other accounting matters which are deemed unnecessary forthese small plants, expensive for the licensees to comply with, and expensivefor the Commission to administer.</ITAG>The commenters' concerns over the waiver of the navigation approval provisionof section 4(e) of the FPA are misplaced. In most cases, these minor projects,due to their small size, do not affect navigation. However, should a particularproject pose a threat to navigation, the Chief of Engineers and the Secretaryof the Army can make their concerns known in their letters of comment filedin response to the public notice issued when the application for the minorproject is accepted for Commission processing. The Commission is not awareof any instance where the Chief of Engineers or the Secretary of the Armyhas objected to waiver of this provision.Trout Unlimited's suggestions regarding notice of intent to waive theseprovisions are unnecessary. First, the provisions of andSection; 4.60(c)will put the public on notice of the Commission's waiver policy for minorlicenses. Second, agencies consulted pursuant to the provisions of andSection;4.38,\24\<NOTE/> in the case of applications for original license, or newandSection; 16.8, in the case of subsequent licenses, will receive copiesof both the draft and final applications. Consequently, they will be awareof applicants' decisions regarding the waiver of these provisions. TheCommission is, however, adding language to andSection; 4.60(c) to make clearthat waiver of these provisions is not merely up to the applicant. TheCommission will not waive any particular provision if it determines thatwaiver would not be in the public interest in a particular case.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\24\ 18 CFR 4.38 (1988). B. Requirement to Show Project Boundaryin Exhibit G of Application for Minor Water Power Project License. Under existing Commission regulations, applications for minor water powerprojects must include reasonably accurate descriptions of the project locationand all project works and features. Applicants for minor water projectsare not required   to show definite project boundaries on the Exhibit Gmaps of their applications, unless their proposed projects would occupyUnited States lands; in that case, definite project boundaries on suchUnited States lands must be shown in order to make clear what United Stateslands would be authorized for use under the license and to assess annualcharges for use of those lands.\25\<NOTE/> This regulatory provision is consistent with the Commission'sroutine waiver practice for minor projects just discussed. Definite projectboundaries are necessary only when there is the possibility that the UnitedStates will take over a project pursuant to section 14 of the FPA, andthus must know the precise property that would be taken. Since section14 has traditionally been waived for minor projects, definite project boundarieswere not required of minor license applicants.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\25\ 18 CFR 4.61(f)(3) (1988). Consistent with its proposal to allow minor license applicants to electnot to have the Commission waive section 14 and the other provisions ofPart I of the FPA,\26\<NOTE/> the Commission proposed in the NOPR to amend andSection; 4.61(f)(3)of its minor license application regulations to require applicants to showdefinite project boundaries on their Exhibit G maps if they requested thatthe Commission apply section 14 and the other provisions of the FPA.\27\<NOTE/> The proposed revisions to andSection; 4.61(f)(3) retained the provision requiring reasonably accurate descriptions of project features,but not definite project boundaries, when section 14 and the other provisionsof the FPA would be waived,\28\<NOTE/> and the provision requiring definite project boundaries onUnited States lands.\29\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\26\ Proposed andSection; 4.60(c). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\27\ Proposed andSection; 4.61(f)(3)(ii).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\28\ Proposed andSection; 4.61(f)(3)(i). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\29\ Proposed andSection; 4.61(f)(3)(iii). Several commenters\30\<NOTE/> object to the proposed revisions to andSection; 4.61(f)(3),and request that it be modified to require all minor license applicantsto show project boundaries on their Exhibit G maps. They argue that a projectboundary description is essential to assessment of project impacts andto competent environmental review, particularly regarding fish and wildliferesources.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\30\ American Rivers, EPA, International Association, MichiganDepartment and Washington Wildlife. The Commission does not accept the commenters' suggestion that a projectboundary is essential for proper environmental review of proposed projects.Commission analysis includes the impacts of a project wherever they mayoccur, and the presence or absence of a project boundary does not broadenor restrict that review. The requirement that all minor license applicantsinclude reasonably accurate descriptions of project locations and features,together with the other information included in the applications, providesthe Commission with the information necessary for proper environmentalreview. Furthermore, as    indicated previously, existing andSection; 4.61(f)(3)does not require definite project boundaries in most cases. The Commissionis not aware of any review problems caused by the lack of a definite projectboundary in any of the numerous applications for minor license that havebeen filed under this regulation. Definite project boundaries are unnecessary for proper environmental andother review of minor projects. A requirement to show definite projectboundaries on Exhibit G maps could be expensive due to the surveying costsassociated with developing such boundaries. Therefore, the Commission willnot require such boundaries except in those cases where boundaries areneeded as a result of potential Federal takeover under section 14 of theFPA. Accordingly, the Commission is adopting the revisions to andSection;4.61(f)(3) proposed in the NOPR, with one editorial change to ensure thatdescriptions of project locations are included in the filed Exhibit G maps.C. Applicability of Revised Regulations and Provisions of the Federal PowerAct. Except for the revisions to andSection;andSection; 4.60 and 4.61 just discussed,the NOPR proposed revisions only to the Commission's existing Part 16 relicensingregulations.\31\<NOTE/> Proposed andSection; 16.1 was a general applicability sectionindicating that Part 16 was to apply to the filing and processing of applicationsfor both projects with existing licenses subject to sections 14 and 15of the FPA, and projects not subject to those sections. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\31\ See 18 CFR Part 16 (1988), as amended by ``Informationto be Made Available by Hydroelectric Licensees under Section 4(a) of theElectric Consumers Protection Act of 1986'', Interim Rule, 52 FR 11,035(Apr. 7, 1987), III FERC Stats. andamp; Regs. andpara; 30,736 (Mar. 30, 1987)and Final Rule, Order No. 496, 53 FR 15,804 (May 4, l988), III FERC Stats.andamp; Regs. andpara; 30,812 (Apr. 28, 1988). The interim and final rulesestablished regulations, required by ECPA, governing the notice and informationrequirements that apply to an existing licensee of a hydroelectric powerproject.Three entities commented on proposed andSection; 16.1. Brazos requests thatandSection; 16.1 be amended to indicate that applications filed with theCommission prior to the date of enactment of the revised regulations wouldnot be covered by the revised regulations. PGandamp;E requests that the proposedsection be amended to indicate that the Commission has the right ``to moderatethe requirements of these regulations where the size and/or impact of theproject is shown to justify such moderation.''\32\<NOTE/> Finally, Washington Wildlife requests that the section beamended to clarify that the authority of the Departments of Commerce andthe Interior to prescribe fishways at projects pursuant to section 18 ofthe FPA \33\<NOTE/> is applicable to relicensing proceedings.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\32\ PGandamp;E at 8. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\33\ 16 U.S.C. 811 (1982).  The Commission declines to adopt the revision suggested by Brazos. Section18 of ECPA specifies that the amendments made to the FPA by ECPA shalltake effect with respect to each license or exemption issued under theFPA after the October 16, 1986 date of enactment of ECPA. To the extentthat the regulations adopted   here implement specific requirements ofthe FPA as added by ECPA, pending applications cannot be excluded fromtheir applicability. However, appropriate transition provisions are beingadded to the new regulations that relate to procedural matters not specificallyaddressed by ECPA, such as proposed andSection; 16.8 relating to agency consultation,\34\<NOTE/> to ensure that applicants are not required to retrace unnecessarilyany steps of the relicensing process.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\34\ <T3>See </T3>new andSection; 16.8(j).  The Commission also declines to adopt the ``moderation'' revision proposedby PGandamp;E. Nothing in ECPA indicates that its revisions to the FPA areto be less stringently applied to small and/or environmentally benign projects.Of course, requests for information made by resource agencies during pre-filingconsultation or by the Commission may be less expansive in the case ofsmall and/or environmentally benign projects. Also, in individual casesapplicants may file requests for waiver of particular provisions of theseregulations if they believe that compliance with these provisions is unnecessaryfor their projects. The Commission may waive such requirements unless theCommission is prevented from waiving them because of statutory restrictions.\35\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\35\ <T3>See </T3>18 CFR 375.314(c) (9) (1988).  With regard to Washington Wildlife's request regarding section 18 of theFPA, the Commission has never resolved the    issue of the applicabilityto relicensing proceedings of the authority of the Interior Departmentand the Department of Commerce to prescribe fishways for projects.\36\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\36\ The comments filed by the Departments of Commerce andthe Interior do not specifically address the question of whether they haveauthority to prescribe fishways in relicensing proceedings. However, fromtheir discussion of how the relicensing process should be integrated withthe prescription of fishways pursuant to section 18, both agencies clearlybelieve they have such authority.  Section 18 reads, in pertinent part:<ITAG tagnum="21">The Commission shall require the construction, maintenance, and operationby a licensee at its own expense of * * * such fishways as may be prescribedby the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Commerce, as appropriate.</ITAG>As the Commission explained in its 1987 order in <T3>Lynchburg Hydro Associates </T3>(<T3>Lynchburg</T3>),\37\<NOTE/> which addressed the scope and mandatory nature of the fishwayprescription authority in the context of original licensing proceedings,the starting point for interpreting a statute is the language of the statuteitself and, absent a clearly expressed legislative intention to the contrary,that language, if unambiguous, must ordinarily be regarded as conclusive.Since section 18 is cast in terms of fishway obligations of ``licensees,''and does not distinguish between original and subsequent licenses, it appearson its face to be applicable to relicensing proceedings.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\37\ 39 FERC andpara; 61,079 (1987).  As indicated in <T3>Lynchburg, </T3>the legislative history of the section is sparse. Reviewof that history does not reveal any    discussion on the issue of whetherthe authority of section 18 to prescribe fishways does or does not applyto relicensing proceedings. Consequently, the facial interpretation ofsection 18 as applying to relicensing proceedings is not contradicted bythe legislative history of the section. From the above, it appears that section 18 should be interpreted as givingthe Departments of Commerce and the Interior the authority to prescribefishways in relicensing proceedings. As the Commission discussed in <T3>Lynchburg, </T3>when it is not feasible to prescribe fishways at thetime of issuance of an original license, the Commission will include acondition in the license reserving the authority of Interior or Commerceto prescribe fishways if and when they are needed in the future. Thus,it is possible that fishways may not be prescribed for an original licenseuntil near its expiration date. Given this, the Commission believes itwould be incongruous to argue that the authority to prescribe fishwaysdoes not apply to nearly contemporaneous relicensing proceedings. The Commission therefore concludes that the authority of Interior and Commerceto prescribe fishways pursuant to section 18 of the FPA is applicable torelicensing proceedings. However, the Commission does not believe it isnecessary to codify this statutory interpretation in the relicensing regulation.The Commission is initiating a rulemaking proceeding to develop formalprocedures for implementing the provisions of section 10(j) of the FPA.\38\<NOTE/> The latter proceeding will also address procedures relatedto the Departments' prescription of mandatory fishways under section 18during the Commission's licensing and relicensing processes.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\38\ <T3>See </T3>Statement of Policy, Order No. 511, 46 FERC andpara; 61,161(1989).  The Commission notes, however, as it did in <T3>Lynchburg, </T3>that the authority to prescribe fishways does not includea broad power to impose mandatory conditions of license:<ITAG tagnum="21">The plain language of section 18 gives the Secretaries the authorityto ``prescribe'' ``fishways.'' It is a specific grant of authority, incontrast to the broader grant of authority in section 4(e) of the FPA,* * * which gives the administering Secretary authority to impose conditions``necessary for the adequate protection and utilization'' of a reservationphysically occupied by licensed project works. Thus, section 18 in ourview empowers the Secretary to prescribe fishways at a licensed project,but <T3>not </T3>to impose, for the protection, mitigation of damages to, andenhancement of fish resources, more far-reaching conditions with respectto the design and operation of the proposed project.\39\<NOTE/>  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\39\ 39 FERC at 61,218 (footnotes omitted) (emphasis added). D. Definitions <ITAG tagnum="81">1. ``New License'' </ITAG>In the NOPR, the Commission proposed to define ``new license'' for purposesof Part 16 as ``a license, except an annual license, for a water powerproject that is issued under section 15 of the Federal Power Act afteran initial license expires.'' \40\<NOTE/> Niagara Mohawk indicates that this definition is inconsistentwith that found in andSection; 4.30(b)(19) of the Commission's regulations,and suggests that the Part 16 definition be made to conform to the definitionfound in Part 4. Washington Wildlife suggests that the Commission shouldchange the definition of new license to ``relicense,'' since the licensingof a project upon the expiration of an existing license is commonly knownas a relicensing proceeding, and since defining such licenses as new licensesmay cause confusion with new licenses issued for entirely new projects. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\40\ Proposed andSection; 16.2(a).The Commission does not believe the recommended changes to the proposeddefinition of new license are necessary. The definition of new licensein andSection; 4.30(b)(19) of the Commission's existing regulations embracesapplications for licenses for projects with expiring licenses that aresubject to sections 14 and 15 of the FPA, and those that are not (<T3>i.e.</T3>, minor licenses where these provisions of the FPA have beenwaived).\41\<NOTE/> Such a definition is appropriate for Part 4, since it eliminateshaving to refer to these different situations in those sections of Part4 intended to apply to both.\42\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\41\ 18 CFR 4.30(b)(19) (1988) defines new license as ``anylicense, except an annual license issued under section 15 of the FederalPower Act, for a water power project that is issued under the Federal PowerAct after the initial license for that project.'' The difference betweenthe definition of new license in andSection; 4.30(b)(19) and in andSection;16.2(a) is relevant only for existing minor licenses where sections 14and 15 have been waived; andSection; 4.30(b)(19) applies to renewal applicationsfor such projects, while andSection; 16.2(a) does not. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\42\ <T3>See, e.g.,</T3> 18 CFR 4.41, 4.51, and 4.61 (1988).However, for purposes of Part 16, it is necessary to distinguish betweencases where sections 14 and 15 have been waived and cases where they havenot. The definition of new license proposed in andSection; 16.2(a) is intendedto cover the latter situation. Unfortunately, a definition to cover theformer situation was inadvertently omitted from the NOPR. The Commissionis rectifying this by including as new andSection; 16.2(e) a definition for``subsequent license.'' Also, the Commission is substituting the word ``original''for ``initial'' in the definition of new license, to accurately reflectthe language used in section 7(a) of the FPA \43\<NOTE/> to describe the first license issued for a project.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\43\ 16 U.S.C. 800(a) (1982 and Supp. 1988).The use of the word ``relicense'' as suggested by Washington Wildlife isinappropriate. Although these proceedings are frequently referred to asrelicensing proceedings by the Commission and others, section 15 of theFPA refers to applications in these cases as applications for ``new license''.The definition used in Part 16 should track the definition used in thestatute. The confusion suggested by Washington Wildlife should not occur,since the FPA refers to the first license issued for a project as an ``originallicense.'' <ITAG tagnum="81">2. ``New License Application Filing Deadline'' </ITAG>The NOPR proposed to define the ``new license application filing deadline''as ``the date 24 months before the expiration of an existing license.''\44\<NOTE/> Washington Wildlife suggests that this date be changed to30 months, to provide more time for the processing of applications priorto the expiration date of existing licenses. The Commission agrees thatchanging the 24-month date to 30 months would provide more time for processingapplications, and that section 15(c)(1) of the FPA \45\<NOTE/> itself would not prohibit an earlier deadline, since it onlyspecifies that applications must be filed with the Commission ``at least''24 months prior to expiration. However, the Commission believes that potentialcompetitors need a full three years from the five-year point when existinglicensees file their notices of intent, pursuant to section 15(b)(1) ofthe FPA,\46\<NOTE/> in which to review the information made available by existinglicensees at that time to determine whether they will compete and to carryout the required consultation with resource agencies in preparing theirapplications. Accordingly, the Commission declines to establish a 30-monthfiling deadline.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\44\ Proposed andSection; 16.2(b).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\45\ 16 U.S.C. 808(c)(1) (1982 and Supp. 1988).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\46\ 16 U.S.C. 808(b)(1) (1982 and Supp. 1988). <ITAG tagnum="81">3. ``Resource Agency'' </ITAG>The NOPR proposed to define ``resource agency'' as ``a Federal or stateagency with responsibilities in the area of flood control, navigation,irrigation, recreation, fish or wildlife, or cultural or other relevantresources.'' \47\<NOTE/> Resource agencies are  participants in the pre-filing consultationprocess described in this final rule. Four commenters \48\<NOTE/> suggest that the Commission specifically add water resourceagencies to its definition.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\47\ Proposed andSection; 16.2(d).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\48\ Brazos, Montana Natural Resources, Washington Ecologyand Western Council. EPA and South Carolina Department request that thedefinition be amended to encompass water quality agencies. However, thisis unnecessary, since proposed andSection; 16.8 clearly covers such agencies.The proposed definition is sufficiently broad to include the appropriatewater resource agencies and was not intended to exclude agencies with responsibilitiesnot specifically listed. However, the Commission recognizes the importanceof the participation of agencies with responsibilities for water resourcesand is modifying the definition to include them specifically.\49\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\49\ EPA suggests that a definition be added for ``minor hydroelectricpower project,'' while Niagara Mohawk suggests that a definition be addedfor a ``nonpower project''. The Commission declines to include a definitionfor a ``minor hydroelectric power project,'' since that term is alreadydefined in section 10(i) of the FPA and 18 CFR andSection; 4.30(b)(17) (1988).There is no need to define a ``nonpower project,'' since it is self explanatory,<T3>i.e.,</T3> a project that is maintained for some nonpower purpose,such as recreation or water supply. E. Public Notice of Expiring LicensesExisting Commission regulations specify that the Commission will publisheach year in its annual report and in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> a table showing the projects with licenses thatwill expire during the succeeding five years.\50\<NOTE/> In the NOPR, the Commission proposed to continue this practice.\51\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\50\ 18 CFR 16.2 (1988).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\51\ Proposed andSection; 16.3.American Rivers suggests that the table be published each year in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, and that the tables include projects with licensesthat will expire during the succeeding six years. American Rivers alsosuggests that the proposed section make clear that projects whose expirationdates have been accelerated pursuant to proposed andSection; 16.4 will beincluded in the tables. Washington Wildlife suggests that the tables includeprojects with licenses that will expire during the succeeding seven years,and be provided to all appropriate fish and wildlife agencies. Finally,Montana Natural Resources suggests that the tables include specific referencesto the procedures required by section 15(b) (2)-(4) of the FPA. The intent of proposed andSection; 16.3 was to have the table published eachyear in both the Commission's annual report and in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>as is currently done. However, to alleviate AmericanRivers' concern, the Commission is inserting ``annually'' in the sectionto make clear that the publication of the table in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>will occur each year. Also, while the Commissiondoes not believe it is necessary to expand the tables to include projectswith licenses expiring during the succeeding seven years as suggested byWashington Wildlife, the Commission is adopting American Rivers' suggestionto expand the coverage of the tables to include the succeeding six years.This will provide more advance notice of upcoming relicensing proceedingsto potential competitors, resource agencies and the public. Projects with expiration dates accelerated pursuant to proposed andSection;16.4 would be included in the tables. Therefore, there is no need to modifyandSection; 16.3 to specify this, as suggested by American Rivers. Also,the Commission does not believe it is necessary to provide copies of thetables directly to appropriate fish and wildlife agencies. As requiredby section 15(b)(3) of the FPA,\52\<NOTE/> the Commission will be providing those and other appropriateresource agencies with notices regarding notices of intent filed by individuallicensees.\53\<NOTE/> Finally, the Commission sees no need to repeat in the tablesthe statutory requirements of section 15(b) (2)-(4), as requested by MontanaNatural Resources.\54\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\52\ 16 U.S.C. 808(b)(3) (1982 and Supp. 1988). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\53\ <T3>See</T3> andSection; 16.15(d), promulgated in Order No. 496, <T3>supra</T3>.

This section will be referred to hereinafteras andSection; 16.6. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\54\ Trout Unlimited and Washington Ecology suggest that andSection;16.3 be amended to incorporate the provisions of section 15(b)(3). However,those provisions are addressed in andSection; 16.6(d) and need not be referencedin andSection; 16.3. F. Acceleration of License Expiration Dates In the NOPR, the Commission proposed to permit a licensee wishing to installnew capacity at its existing project to file a written request to advancethe expiration date of the existing license, called a request for acceleration.\55\<NOTE/> The purpose of this proposal was to allow an applicant toincrease project  capacity at an earlier time as a result of financingthat could become available with a new long-term license.\56\<NOTE/> The NOPR \57\<NOTE/> specified that the request would have to contain the samestatements and information required to be included in a notice of intentfiled pursuant to andSection; 16.6, that the Commission would treat the requestas a notice of intent, and that the requester would have to make availableto the public at that time the information specified in andSection; 16.16.\58\<NOTE/> The Commission proposed to give <T4>Federal Register </T4>and local newspaper notice of the licensee'srequest for acceleration, notify appropriate Federal and state resourceagencies by mail, provide a 45-day period for comments by interested parties,and, if it determined that the request was in the public interest, issuean order accelerating the expiration date of the license to five yearsfrom the date of the Commission order.\59\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\55\ Proposed andSection; l6.4. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\56\ <T3>See</T3> NOPR preamble at 40. All references herein to pages of theNOPR preamble are to the slip opinion because the full text was not publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. Copies of the full text of the NOPR are availablefrom the Commission's Public Reference Room. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\57\ Proposed andSection; 16.4(a). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\58\ Section 16.16, which was promulgated in Order No. 496,supra, implements the provisions of section 15(b)(2) of the FPA, 16 U.S.C.808(b)(2) (1982 and Supp. 1988), which requires existing licensees to makeavailable to the public for inspection and copying certain informationregarding their projects at the time they file their notices of intentpursuant to section 15(b)(1) of the FPA. The final rule in the instantproceeding redesignates andSection; l6.16 as andSection; l6.7. This sectionwill be referred to hereinafter as andSection; 16.7. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\59\ Proposed andSection;andSection; 16.4(b) and (c). Several commenters addressed the issue of the basis for requesting acceleratedtermination of a license. EEI suggests  that licensees be permitted toseek acceleration for improvements other than installation of new capacity,such as dam safety improvements or facilities for the protection and enhancementof fish and wildlife resources. It argues that the rationale for accelerationadvanced in the preamble to the NOPR is equally applicable to these situations.Idaho Power suggests that there are valid bases for acceleration of licenseexpiration dates for other than installation of new capacity, includingrehabilitation work for reasons of safety and spillway modifications. IdahoPower also suggests that acceleration could be used to make the expirationdates of licenses for related projects coincide, so that the Commissioncould consider the projects together in a single relicensing proceeding.Therefore, Idaho Power suggests that a licensee be permitted to requestacceleration for any reason. Montana Power also suggests that there are valid bases for accelerationother than new capacity, citing safety and fish and wildlife concerns.It recommends permitting acceleration for any legitimate reason that isin the public interest and consistent with statutory purposes. Trout Unlimited suggests that the Commission discourage acceleration inthe short term, because of the extremely heavy volume of upcoming relicensingproceedings. Other commenters focus on the interpretation of the term ``newcapacity''. Washington Wildlife recommends that the Commission adopt aguideline specifying that at least a 20 percent increase in project productionis needed to justify acceleration of a license expiration date. MontanaPower also suggests that the Commission clarify the term ``new capacity'',and recommends that it encompass only cases where generation is to be increasedthrough additional water usage or through conversion of a plant from arun-of-the-river facility to a peaking facility. Two commenters address the issue of when a licensee should be requiredto make the information available to the public pursuant to andSection; 16.7.EEI suggests that, rather than requiring a licensee to make the informationavailable at the time the acceleration request is made, the Commissionshould wait until it approves the request for accelerated termination andthen require the licensee to make the information available within 120days. EEI contends that compiling the information and making it availablein the required form is a burden, and that if the Commission denies therequest some of the information will become stale before the original expirationdate. Montana Power also cites the needless compilation of informationshould the request be denied, and suggests that the licensee be requiredto make the information available within a reasonable time after a requestfor accelerated termination is granted. The South Carolina Department asks that the Commission clarify when the45-day comment period begins, and suggests that the Commission use certifiedmail to notify agencies of applications for acceleration. Washington Wildlifesuggests that the notices issued pursuant to andSection; 16.4(b) includethe information specified in andSection; 16.3(b). Montana Power wants toimpose time limits within which the Commission must either grant or denyan acceleration request; this would avoid ``potential crippling uncertainty''\60\<NOTE/> caused by the licensee not knowing when the Commission mightact and therefore having difficulty drafting reliable project schedulesand organizing and coordinating its relicensing effort. Also, Montana Powerquestions why the new expiration date must be five years from the dateof the Commission order. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\60\ Montana Power at 8. Finally, New York Electric and Rochester Gas request that the Commissionclarify that, under the proposed provision, licensees wishing to increasecapacity are not required to risk their existing licenses by seeking acceleration,and that the alternative of application for a license amendment to expandcapacity remains available to them. The Commission agrees that there may be valid bases for acceleration otherthan new capacity. Accordingly, the Commission is revising andSection; 16.4(a)(1)to eliminate the reference to the installation of new capacity, and toadd the requirement that a licensee include in its acceleration requesta detailed explanation of the basis for its request. Thus, any legitimateinterest, including, but not limited to, installation of new capacity,dam safety modifications, and fish and wildlife improvements, may serveas the basis for an acceleration request.  The Commission notes, however,that licensees are responsible for conducting routine operation and maintenanceon their projects and that such routine operation and maintenance activitieswill not justify an acceleration request. The Commission does not believe it is necessary to discourage accelerationrequests in the short-term, as suggested by Trout Unlimited. Although asignificant number of relicensing proceedings will be initiated in thenear future, the Commission does not anticipate that many licensees willattempt to avail themselves of the acceleration procedure. Furthermore,the Commission will be able to weigh potential burdens on Commission resourceswhen it is considering whether to grant acceleration requests. The Commission also does not believe it is necessary to establish restrictionson the type or size of new capacity installations that will justify anacceleration request, as suggested by Washington Wildlife and Montana Power.The Commission will evaluate the merits of each case individually, andwill grant an acceleration request only if it will be in the public interestto do so. The Commission agrees with EEI and Montana Power that the obligation tomake information available pursuant to andSection; 16.7 should be tied toCommission approval of an acceleration request. Ninety days following Commissionapproval of an acceleration request should be sufficient time for licenseesto compile the required information and make it available. Therefore, theCommission is revising andSection; 16.4(a)(2) to specify that, should theCommission grant the request for acceleration, the Commission will deemthe request for acceleration to be a notice of intent under andSection; 16.6.Unless the Commission specifies a later period, the licensee will be requiredto make available the information specified in andSection; 16.7 no laterthan 90 days from the date the Commission grants the request. Also, theCommission is revising andSection; 16.4(b): (1) To clarify that the noticesissued pursuant to that paragraph will be considered as fulfilling thenotice provisions of andSection; 16.6(d) should the Commission grant theacceleration request; (2) to specify that the notices issued pursuant tothat paragraph must include an explanation of the basis for the accelerationrequest; \61\<NOTE/> (3) to include Indian tribes among those receiving the notices,so as to be consistent with andSection; 16.6(d); and (4) to reduce the numberof times the notice is published in a local newspaper from four to one.The reduction in the number of times public notice is issued will reducecosts while still providing the public and resource  agencies with amplenotice of the request. A comparable change regarding the reduction in thenumber of times a notice will be issued is being made to andSection; 16.6(d)(2).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\61\ Since both the notices issued pursuant to this sectionand andSection; 16.6(d) will include information comparable to that specifiedin andSection; 16.3(b), there is no need to specifically reference andSection;16.3(b) in this provision as requested by Washington Wildlife. EPA suggeststhat andSection; 16.4 be amended to clarify that a licensee should be obligatedto provide information to resource agencies at the time the licensee requestsacceleration. Although it is unclear what information EPA is referringto, pursuant to the revisions made to andSection; 16.4 herein, the informationrequired by andSection; 16.7 will be available to all entities, includingresource agencies, within 90 days from the date the Commission approvesan acceleration request.As indicated previously, Montana Power questions why the new expirationdate of an accelerated license must be five years from the date of theCommission order. The purpose of the five-year period was to preserve thefive-year window between the time a licensee is to first make informationavailable and the expiration of the license as established by ECPA. TheCommission is revising andSection; 16.4(a)(2) to provide that, unless theCommission specifies a later period, information must be made availableno later than 90 days from the date the Commission approves an accelerationrequest. Therefore, the Commission is also revising andSection; 16.4(c) tospecify that the expiration date of an accelerated license will be notless than five years plus 90 days from the date of the Commission orderapproving the acceleration request. The qualifying language in andSection;16.4(a)(2) and the ``not less than'' language in andSection; 16.4(c) arebeing used in order to provide the Commission with flexibility in settingexpiration dates later than five years in situations where that would beappropriate, such as when requests are made to coincide with the expirationdates of related projects, as suggested by Idaho Power. With regard to the clarification requested by the South Carolina Department,the andSection; 16.4(b) notices will specify when the 45-day comment periodwill expire. Due to the expense involved, the Commission declines to adoptthe South Carolina Department's suggestion that the notices to resourceagencies be sent by certified mail. The Commission is sympathetic to the uncertainty concerns prompting MontanaPower's request for a deadline for Commission action on acceleration requests.The Commission will attempt to act on all acceleration requests in a timelymanner and intends that a decision on a request will be made within 45days after the expiration of the comment period. Also, a degree of certaintyregarding the scheduling of relicensing activities is provided to thoserequesting acceleration due to the fact that license expiration dates willalways be set at least five years plus 90 days from the date of the Commissionorder approving the acceleration request. The Commission also notes that the comments of New York Electric and RochesterGas are correct. Licensees always have the ability to file applicationsto amend their licenses to increase the capacity of their projects, anddo not have to request acceleration of their licenses to do so.\62\<NOTE/> If the term of an existing license is less than the statutorymaximum of 50 years,\63\<NOTE/> increases in capacity or other improvements requiring substantialnew investment may justify an extension of the license term up to 50 years.\64\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\62\ The Commission may, however, decline to consider newcapacity amendments which are requested by an existing licensee near theexpiration date of an existing license if it appears that it would be inthe public interest to consider those amendments in the context of a relicensingproceeding where competing redevelopment proposals may be considered. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\63\ <T3>See </T3>section 6 of the FPA. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\64\ <T3>See, e.g.</T3>, Fieldcrest Mills, 37 FERC andpara; 61,264 (1986).G. SiteAccess for Competing Applicants In the NOPR, the Commission proposed to establish a procedure whereby apotential applicant for a new license for an existing project that hascomplied with paragraph (b)(1) of the proposed andSection; 16.8 consultationprocess could enter the project area to conduct a study or gather informationrequired by a resource agency or the Commission, or to hold a site visitfor a resource agency.\65\<NOTE/> The proposed section would require the potential applicantto notify the existing licensee in writing of its need for access, andto enter the project area at a reasonable time, under reasonable conditions,and in a manner that would not adversely affect the environment. Thoseconditions included, but were not limited to, reasonable liability conditionsand conditions for compensation to the existing licensee for energy generationlost as a result of modification of project operations necessary to provideaccess. The proposed section is consistent with the Commission's orderin <T3>Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation</T3>,\66\<NOTE/> and was intended to formalize the procedures ordered in thatcase.\67\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\65\ Proposed andSection; 16.5. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\66\ 43 FERC andpara; 61,015 (1988). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\67\ <T3>See </T3>NOPR preamble at 41.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Basis for Access </ITAG>American Rivers suggests that the permissible purposes for site visitsare unduly limited and that they should be expanded to include ``any purposerelated to the preparation of an application''\68\<NOTE/> after completion of the first stage of consultation, andnot merely to conduct a study or hold a site visit requested by a resourceagency or the Commission. Conversely, EEI and Alabama Power suggest thatthe purpose for which a site visit may be conducted should be limited tosituations in which the potential applicant cannot conduct a study or gatherinformation by other ``reasonably diligent efforts.''\69\<NOTE/> According to EEI, because access to an operating hydroelectricpower production site may be intrusive and disruptive, site visits shouldbe a last resort.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\68\ American Rivers at 8. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\69\ EEI at 5A; Alabama Power at 4. American Paper suggests that access be restricted to areas within the projectfor which the competitor can demonstrate a need for access, and that theparty seeking access be required to demonstrate to the existing licenseesthe basis on which access is requested. Similarly, Rochester Gas suggeststhat a potential applicant seeking access identify the information thatnecessitates access for collection, and that the competitor then be permittedto gain access only to those areas of the site that will provide such information.  In its reply comments, the Northern California Agency suggests that theCommission permit potential competitors to have access to sites in orderto evaluate the condition of existing equipment, and hence decide how bestto develop the site. As to EEI's and Alabama Power's suggestion that potentialapplicants be permitted access only if they demonstrate that they cannotconduct the study or gather the information by other reasonably diligentefforts, the Northern California Agency contends that it would be unreasonablewhen such other means would be considerably more time consuming or expensive.The Commission rejects the recommendation to require potential applicantsto show that the information cannot otherwise be obtained or the studyconducted through other reasonably diligent efforts before they can obtainaccess. It would not be an efficient use of the nation's resources, orconsistent with the competitive spirit underlying ECPA, to require potentialapplicants to gather necessary information and conduct necessary studiesthrough means that are more time consuming and expensive than informationdevelopment through site access. Although the ``reasonably diligent'' qualifierof the recommended change might insulate potential competitors from havingto undertake speculative and exorbitantly expensive studies as a conditionprecedent to access, the potential for disputes inherent in such languagewould be great. This in turn could require Commission staff to devote considerableresources to resolving disputes. The intrusion and disruption cited byEEI should be minimized by the requirement that access take place at reasonabletimes and under reasonable conditions. The suggestions advanced by American Rivers and the Northern CaliforniaAgency to expand the permissible purposes for site visits are reasonable.Potential applicants may need site access in order to develop informationor conduct studies necessary for their applications that may not be requestedby consulted agencies or the Commission. There is no bright line betweenstudies and information needed to develop an application, and those requestedby consulted agencies or the Commission. Furthermore, any study or informationneed could be turned into one requested by a consulted agency or the Commissionby a potential applicant's failing to either propose to conduct or actuallyconduct the study or information gathering. Accordingly, the Commission is revising proposed andSection; 16.5 to permitsite access for the purpose of conducting a study or gathering informationnot requested by the Commission or a resource agency but necessary to preparean application.\70\<NOTE/> However, to help ensure that access for such purposes doesnot turn into general fishing expeditions for information, the Commissionis making the need for such access a subject for dispute resolution.\71\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\70\ <T3>See </T3>new andSection; 16.5(a)(2). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\71\ <T3>See </T3>new andSection; 16.5(b)(1), discussed in Part IV.G.3., <T3>infra. </T3>American Paper's and Rochester Gas' suggestions requiring a potential applicantto state the purpose and extent of the needed access are reasonable. Thisinformation will enable the parties to determine the conditions of access.Accordingly, we will require potential applicants to include a statementof the need for and extent of the access in their notices to existing licensees.However, to the extent the comments of American Paper and Rochester Gassuggest that existing licensees should be able to deny access based ontheir conclusion that access is not needed, those suggestions are rejected.If access is needed to conduct studies or site visits or to gather informationrequested by consulted agencies or the Commission, the existing licenseemust provide access to the site. However, the timing and conditions ofaccess may be referred to the Director of the Office of Hydropower Licensing(Director).\72\<NOTE/> Disputes regarding the need of a potential applicant to obtainaccess to conduct studies or gather information not requested by the Commissionor a resource agency but necessary to prepare an application may also beso referred. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\72\ <T3>Id.</T3><ITAG tagnum="81">2. Compensation </ITAG>Ten commenters\73\<NOTE/> address the issue of reimbursement to existing licenseesfor the costs of site visits, suggesting that reimbursement be for ``anyand all costs'' or ``all reasonable costs,'' rather than merely for thecosts of lost generation as proposed in the NOPR. They argue that the personnelcosts, operation and maintenance expenses associated with inspections,and all other costs associated with access, should be reimbursable. Accordingto them, full reimbursement is necessary to avoid forcing an existing licenseeinto the unfair situation of subsidizing its potential competition.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\73\ Alabama Power, EEI, Idaho Power, New York Electric, PublicPool, Puget Sound Power, Southern California Edison, Rochester Gas, WashingtonPower and Wisconsin Utilities. In reply comments, the Northern California Agency opposes the recommendationto allow existing licensees to recover all reasonable expenses incurredas a result of access. According to the Northern California Agency, thistype of provision can be used as a barrier to access while an existinglicensee forces a potential competitor to waste time negotiating paymentterms. It also argues that costs other than lost generation are likelyto be <T3>de minimis, </T3>and that existing licensees should be required tobear these costs as part of their obligations under Part I of the FPA.The Commission believes that existing licensees should not be requiredto incur expenses associated with the preparation of   applications bypotential competitors. Therefore, the Commission is revising andSection;16.5 to require reimbursement for all reasonable expenses incurred by existinglicensees as a result of providing access to potential competitors. However,the Commission stresses that the expenses must be reasonable. Thus, forexample, the wages and associated expenses incurred by an existing licenseewhen sending one or two individuals to one of its unmanned hydroelectricsites to permit a potential competitor to have access to the site wouldbe reimburseable, while the expenses associated with sending a platoonto scrutinize a potential competitor's every step would not. In order to prevent existing licensees from abusing their right to reimbursement,the Commission is amending andSection; 16.5 to allow disputes over paymentto be referred to the Director for resolution. However, in response tothe concerns of the Northern California Agency regarding delay, the Commissionis specifying that access cannot be denied pending resolution of a disputeover payment.\74\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\74\ <T3>See </T3>new andSection; 16.5(b)(2), discussed in Part IV.G.3., <T3>infra.</T3> <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Procedural Matters </ITAG>Idaho Power and Puget Sound Power suggest that andSection; 16.5 be amendedto permit disputes over access to be referred to the Director for resolution.The Northern California Agency recommends that, should a dispute resolutionprocedure be added, the Commission ensure that the disputes be resolvedexpeditiously   in order to allow potential applicants to meet the filingdeadlines established by ECPA. The Commission agrees that a dispute resolution process will assist inproviding reasonable access to potential competitors, and will help deterpotential abuses by both existing licensees and potential competitors.Accordingly, the Commission is adding a new paragraph (b) to andSection;16.5, to permit referral to the Director of disputes regarding: (1) Thetiming and conditions of access; (2) the need for access to conduct studiesand information gathering not requested by the consulted agencies or theCommission but necessary to prepare an application; and (3) reimbursementdue existing licensees for providing access. The new procedures will bein accord with those established for resolution of disputes during theagency pre-filing consultation process.\75\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\75\ <T3>See </T3>andSection; 16.8(b)(5), discussed in Part IV.H.2.e., <T3>infra.</T3> As the Commission stated in <T3>Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation</T3>, <T3>supra</T3>, it fully expects that in most cases existing licenseesand potential competitors will be able to resolve access disputes withoutcoming to the Commission.\76\<NOTE/> Thus, the Commission does not expect the dispute resolutionprocess to be used frequently. As urged by the Northern California Agency,when disputes are lodged the Director will attempt to resolve them expeditiously.As discussed <T3>infra</T3>, the Commission intends   for the Director to make everyeffort to resolve referred disputes within 30 days from receipt of allrelevant information. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\76\ <T3>See </T3>43 FERC at 61,050. The NOPR proposed in andSection; 16.5 that only potential applicants thathad initiated the first stage of agency consultation could obtain access.The Small Business Administration objects to this provision, arguing thataccess might be required to obtain information needed to compile the andSection;16.8(b)(1) information package. It therefore suggests, as an alternative,that site access be available if a potential applicant can demonstratethat access is necessary to secure andSection; 16.8(b)(1) information neededby a resource agency to evaluate the project during the first stage ofconsultation. In addition, Seattle Light, without further explanation,suggests that a potential applicant demonstrate a certain level of commitmentto an application before it is granted access to a project site. The Commission's purpose in providing for an access triggering point wasto strike a balance between access for serious competitors and unnecessaryinconvenience to existing licensees. The Small Business Administration'ssuggestion that the balance point should be moved forward has certain merit.Nevertheless, the Commission believes that adherence to the completionof the requirements of andSection; 16.8(b)(1) as the threshold for accesswill best maintain the balance between providing access which is necessaryfor serious potential applicants while minimizing unnecessary inconvenienceto existing licensees. Furthermore, the information that existing licenseesare required to make available to the public pursuant to andSection; 16.7,together with the information on existing projects available for inspectionby the public at the Commission, should enable potential applicants togather the information they need to undertake first-stage agency consultation.\77\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\77\ For the same reasons, Seattle Light's apparent requestto move the balance point back is rejected. The Interior Department recommends that andSection; 16.5 be amended to recognizethat Federal agencies have the right to obtain access to existing projectsin order to conduct environmental studies. This is unnecessary becausestandard articles included by the Commission in licenses already providefor such access.\78\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\78\ <T3>See</T3>, <T3>e.g.</T3>, Article 4 of L-1 (``Terms and Conditions of License forConstructed Major Project Affecting Lands of the United States''), 54 F.P.C.1799, 1800-1801 (Oct. 1975), which provides that the licensee ``shall allow* * * other officers or employees of the United States, showing propercredentials, free and unrestricted access to, through, and across the projectlands and project works in the performance of their official duties.''Finally, the Commission is clarifying that the andSection; 16.5 access provisionsare applicable to projects under expiring licenses that are not subjectto the provisions of sections 14 and 15 of the FPA, and is removing theprovision that prohibits access prior to the filing of the existing licensee'snotice of intent. The latter change is to facilitate potential competitorsthat choose to initiate formal consultation under andSection; 16.8 priorto the filing of the existing licensee's notice of intent.   H. Consultation Section 4.38 of the Commission's regulations \79\<NOTE/> requires applicants, including applicants for new license,to conduct a three-stage consultation process with all relevant resourceagencies prior to filing their applications with the Commission. Becauseof the statutory deadline for filing applications added to the FPA by ECPAand the great number of applications for new license anticipated in thenear future, the Commission proposed in the NOPR to implement a revisedthree-stage consultation process for relicensing proceedings. That processwas intended to facilitate more expeditious and responsive consultation,and hence the filing of complete applications by the statutory deadline.\80\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\79\ 18 CFR 4.38 (1988). In the initial stage, a potentialapplicant must contact all appropriate agencies and provide them with detailedinformation regarding the proposed project, including detailed maps containingdescriptions of the project area and location of proposed project facilities,engineering designs of the proposed project, identification of the environmentto be affected, any environmental protection, mitigation and enhancementplans, and stream flow and water regime information. During the secondstage, potential applicants must perform all reasonable studies requestedby the consulted agencies. Again during this second stage, potential applicantsare required to provide the agencies with copies of the draft application,the results of all studies, and written requests for the agencies' reviewand comment thereon. During the third stage, an applicant for a projectof less than 5 MW must serve copies of its application on the consultedagencies when it files the application with the Commission. An applicantfor a project of 5 MW or more must serve copies of its application on theconsulted agencies after receiving notification from the Commission thatthe application has been accepted for Commission processing. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\80\ Proposed andSection; l6.8. Virtually every entity filing comments on the NOPR addressed the proposedconsultation provisions. The commenters were generally supportive of theintent of the proposal and the additional structure the proposal wouldadd to the consultation process. However, even those supporting the proposalrecommended that numerous changes be made to the section. The major recommendations,suggestions, and comments of all of the commenters are discussed in detailbelow. As a threshold matter, the Commission is clarifying the issue of when consultationwith resource agencies can be initiated. In the NOPR, the Commission indicatedthat existing licensees and other potential applicants would have approximatelythree years following the filing of existing licensees' notices of intentunder section 15(b)(1) of the FPA within which to conduct consultationbefore having to file their applications under the 24-month applicationfiling deadline established by section 15(c)(1) of the FPA.\81\<NOTE/> A number of the commenters, in discussing various aspectsof the consultation provisions, interpreted this as a statement by theCommission that consultation with agencies could not begin until the filingof an existing licensee's notice of intention.\82\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\81\ <T3>See </T3>NOPR preamble at 9. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\82\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>Idaho Power at 3 and Public Pool at 6. This was not the intent of the statement; rather, the statement merelyexpressed the Commission's belief that most applicants probably would waituntil the filing of the section 15(b)(1) notice of intent to initiate agencyconsultation. Applicants are free to initiate informal consultations, orthe formal consultation required by andSection; 16.8, prior to the five-yearnotice of intent deadline. Indeed, they are encouraged to do so in caseswhere they expect that necessary studies will require extended periodsof time to complete. Conversely, there is no fixed deadline by which consultationmust be initiated. However, applicants that postpone the initiation ofconsultation much after the filing of the section 15(b)(1) notices of intentrun the risk of not being able to comply with the requirements of andSection;16.8. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. General Requirement to Consult </ITAG>Proposed andSection; 16.8(a)(1) specified that, before an applicant filesan application for new license, nonpower license, exemption, or surrender,it must consult with the relevant Federal and state resource agencies,including the National Marine Fisheries Service, the United States Fishand Wildlife Service, the Federal agency administering any United Stateslands utilized or occupied by the project, the appropriate state fish andwildlife agencies, and the certifying agency under section 401 of the FederalWater Pollution Control Act (Clean Water Act). Proposed andSection; 16.8(a)(2)specified that the Director or appropriate Regional Director will providea list of known appropriate Federal and state resource agencies upon request.Brazos, Washington Ecology, and Western Council suggest that state waterresource management agencies be added to the list of agencies specificallyenumerated in andSection; 16.8(a)(1). The EPA suggests that it be includedin the list of enumerated agencies. The Connecticut Commission suggeststhat it be included as a consulted agency for any project in the ConnecticutRiver Basin. Brazos and Western Council suggest that andSection; 16.8(a)(2)be modified to specify that, with regard to state resource agencies, theDirector shall request and use a list prepared by the governor of eachstate. Similarly, Montana Natural Resources suggests that the Directorsolicit lists of state agencies from the states and forward the lists automaticallyto each applicant. Consistent with its revision to andSection; 16.2(d), the Commission is addingstate water resource management agencies to the list of enumerated andSection;16.8(a)(1) agencies. Also, due to its significant resource responsibilities,the EPA is being added to the enumerated agency list even though, likestate water resource management agencies, it would be considered a resourceagency without being specifically named. Finally, andSection; 16.8(a)(1)is being revised to clarify that interstate agencies with relevant resourceresponsibilities, such as the Connecticut Commission, are to be consultedby applicants.\83\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\83\ A similar change is being made to the definition of resourceagency in andSection; 16.2(d).The suggestion that the Director solicit agency lists from the governorof each state is reasonable, since it will help clarify for applicantsthe existence and specific responsibilities of relevant state resourceagencies. Accordingly, the Commission is instructing the Director to solicitsuch lists and provide any responses received to applicants upon request.The Commission declines, however, to amend andSection; 16.8(a)(2) to requirethe Director to use the lists supplied by the governors as the Director'slists, since the governors' lists may not contain all agencies with whomthe Director believes applicants should consult. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. First-Stage Consultation </ITAG>Under the first stage of the proposed consultation regulation (andSection;16.8(b)), potential applicants are to provide to each appropriate resourceagency and the Commission basic information regarding the existing projectand any proposed changes.\84\<NOTE/> After each agency has had 30 days to review this information,the applicant is required to provide an opportunity for a site visit, andhold one or more joint meetings or conference calls with all pertinentagencies to review information and to discuss the data and studies to beprovided by the applicant.\85\<NOTE/> The potential applicant is to inform the Commission in advanceof the time and place of each meeting or conference call so as to enableCommission staff, if they so choose, to attend the joint meetings or participatein the conference calls.\86\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\84\ Proposed andSection; 16.8(b)(1).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\85\ Proposed andSection; 16.8(b)(2).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\86\ <T3>See</T3> NOPR preamble at 12. The NOPR specified that each consulted resource agency was to provide theapplicant with written comments identifying its ``final'' determinationof necessary studies to be performed or information to be provided by theapplicant. The NOPR required that these written agency comments be providedwithin 30 days after the joint meeting or conference call ``during whichthere is agreement by all participants that the information required byandSection; 16.8(b)(1) has been provided.''\87\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\87\ Proposed andSection; 16.8(b)(3). The NOPR specified that, if an applicant disagrees with a resource agencyas to whether a study is reasonable and necessary or as to the manner inwhich a study should be performed, it can refer the matter to the Directorfor resolution, except where the study itself or the manner in which anagency requested it be performed is routinely conducted or used on thetype of project proposed.\88\<NOTE/> It also provided that, if an applicant does not refer thematter to the Director, or if it disagrees with the Director's resolutionof the matter and does not conduct the requested study or perform it inthe manner specified, it must fully explain the basis for its disagreementin its application.\89\<NOTE/> Finally, the NOPR specified that the first stage of consultationends when all participating agencies provide the required written comments.\90\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\88\ Proposed andSection; 16.8(b)(4)(i).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\89\ Proposed andSection; 16.8(b)(4)(ii).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\90\ Proposed andSection; 16.8(b)(5). <T3>a. Commission Attendance at Joint Meetings.</T3> Puget Sound Powerand Great Northern support the possibility of Commission staff attendanceat consultation meetings, in the belief that staff's presence might encourageparties to refrain from extreme positions and work toward reasonable accommodationof each other's interests. Southern California Edison expresses certainreservations about Commission involvement in the consultation process,stating that it would prefer that Commission participation after the initialjoint meeting be at the invitation and discretion of the potential applicant.Wisconsin Utilities suggests that the Commission not directly participatein the consultation process except to resolve disputed issues pursuantto andSection; 16.8(b)(4). Wisconsin Utilities expresses concern that Commissionpresence could be counterproductive, since it could trigger posturing byagencies and applicants attempting to influence the Commission's positionon disputed issues, or might undermine the Commission's impartiality ifthe Director is later required to arbitrate a dispute. Niagara Mohawk objects to the requirement to provide the andSection; 16.8(b)(1)information package to the Commission. According to Niagara Mohawk, theCommission does not need this information  unless and until the Directoris called upon to resolve a dispute pursuant to andSection; 16.8(b)(4). Also,Alabama Power and Wisconsin Utilities object to the requirement that theCommission be notified in advance of each meeting, contending that it wouldbe burdensome.The purpose of giving Commission staff the opportunity to attend the first-stagejoint consultation meeting and subsequent meetings during the consultationprocess is twofold. First, it is to enable the Commission to become familiarwith the proposed projects and their associated resource issues, and thusto enable it to more expeditiously resolve any disputes referred underandSection; 16.8(b)(4) and to process applications once they are filed. Second,it is to enable Commission staff, if so-called upon at a meeting, to offeradvice and provide guidance regarding normal Commission information needs.\91\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\91\ Commission staff attending such meetings will not attemptto resolve any disputes that may arise between applicants and resourceagencies. Any disputes that the parties want resolved by the Commissionmust be referred to the Director in accordance with the formal disputeresolution procedures.The Commission does not believe that attendance at such consultation meetingswill encourage posturing. It should encourage accommodation of interests.Commission staff advice on the Commission's information requirements shouldaid the consultation process. Commission staff attendance at such meetingsshould be left to staff's discretion, rather than being subject to thediscretion of the applicant. Accordingly, the  Commission rejects the recommendationsof Southern California Edison and Wisconsin Utilities. The Commission also declines to adopt Niagara Mohawk's suggestion to eliminatethe requirement to provide the andSection; 16.8(b)(1) information packageto the Commission. This package contains the information needed by Commissionstaff to determine if it wants to attend a meeting and to familiarize itselfwith a project prior to the first-stage joint consultation meeting. Receiptof this information at this time will assist in the prompt resolution ofany andSection; 16.8(b)(4) disputes that may arise later. Finally, the Commissionrejects the suggestion of Alabama Power and Wisconsin Utilities that therequirement for advance Commission notice of meetings be eliminated. Whilethis requirement will impose an additional duty on applicants, it shouldnot prove to be unduly burdensome and is necessary for Commission staffto become aware of the meetings. <T3>b. Information.</T3> As noted previously, andSection; 16.8(b)(1) requiresapplicants to provide resource agencies with certain basic informationregarding the existing project and any proposed changes. The informationrequirements, which are set out in proposed andSection; 16.8(b)(2) (i) to(vi), include: information regarding the specific location of all existingand proposed project features ((i)); general engineering design information((ii)); a summary of the operational mode of the existing project and anyproposed changes ((iii)); identification of the environment affected, thesignificant resources present, and the applicant's existing and proposedenvironmental protection, mitigation, and enhancement plans, to the extentknown at the time ((iv)); streamflow and water regime information ((v));and a tentative schedule and location for the initial joint consultationmeeting or conference call ((vi)). A number of commenters remarked on the types and scope of the informationrequired by andSection; 16.8(b)(1). The Michigan Department suggests thatthe information required by andSection; 16.8(b)(1) (iii) and (v) be moredetailed. Similarly, International Association and the New York Departmentsuggest that the information provisions be expanded to require the submittalof significantly more detailed information on environmental resources andphysical characteristics of bypassed and downstream river reaches. Theyalso suggest that applicants be required to secure from state and Federalagencies any available information and management objectives on fisheryand wildlife resources and, based on that information and those objectives,prepare preliminary recommendations for environmental mitigation. The EPAsuggests that applicants be required to provide more detailed informationon water quality and affected wetlands. The Michigan Department suggests that applicants be required to includeinformation pertaining to their record of compliance with the terms andconditions of their licenses. The New York Department suggests that andSection;16.8(b)(1)(i) be amended to require applicants to delineate project boundariesso that agencies can analyze the environmental impacts of projects. MontanaNatural Resources suggests that applicants be required to identify Federaland Indian lands included in the project and provide a statement of annualfees paid pursuant to section 15(b)(4) of the FPA.\92\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\92\ 16 U.S.C. 808(b)(4) (1982 and Supp. 1988).Idaho Power objects to the provisions of proposed andSection; 16.8(b)(1)(v),which requires various streamflow and water regime information. Idaho Powerargues that the information required is unnecessarily complex and willinvolve submission of large amounts of data to agencies with neither theexpertise nor staff to analyze it. Niagara Mohawk suggests that andSection;16.8(b)(1) (i), (ii), and (iii) be revised by adding the phrase ``to theextent known'' to reflect the fact that an applicant may not know its finaldevelopment plans until environmental mitigation measures are developedin consultation with the agencies. Finally, PGandamp;E and the Departmentof Commerce suggest that a provision be added to andSection; 16.8(b)(1) thatwould require applicants to include in their information packages, descriptionsof the studies they intend to conduct and the methodologies they plan toemploy in conducting them. The Commission is adopting the recommendation of PGandamp;E and the Departmentof Commerce regarding the applicants' identification of proposed studiesand methodologies. This will assist  resource agencies in determining whatadditional studies are needed, and will help applicants and resource agenciesto more promptly identify and discuss potential issues regarding selectionof appropriate methodologies.\93\<NOTE/> The Commission is also adopting in part the recommendationof the New York Department regarding project boundaries, by amending paragraph(b)(1)(i) to require applicants to show any existing project boundaries.However, the Commission declines to require all applicants to show boundariesaround all project facilities, since boundaries for new facilities maynot be known at this point in the consultation process, or may not be requiredat all for certain projects.\94\<NOTE/> Also, as discussed previously, the Commission's analysisof environmental impacts, and hence the resource agencies' review of potentialenvironmental issues, is not constrained by project boundaries. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\93\ <T3>See </T3>new andSection; 16.8(b)(1)(vi). As discussed in Part IV.H.2.d.,<T3>infra</T3>, the former text of andSection; 16.8(b)(1)(vi) is being eliminated.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\94\ <T3>See </T3>Part IV.B., <T3>supra</T3>, regarding applications for minor licenses.As generally discussed in the reply comments of EEI, Georgia Power, andPGandamp;E, the detailed information that International Association, theNew York Department, the EPA, and the Michigan Department request to berequired of applicants is the type that normally will be developed duringthe latter stages of the consultation process. Requiring this detailedinformation at the initiation of the consultation process would essentiallycompress  these latter stages into the first stage. Accordingly, the Commissiondeclines to adopt the detailed environmental information recommendationsof these agencies. If these agencies believe that any of this informationis necessary for their evaluation of a particular project, they can requestthat the potential applicant conduct the necessary study or gather thenecessary information in preparing its application for the project. The Commission does not believe that it would be appropriate to requirepotential applicants to solicit and identify resource information and managementobjectives of the resource agencies at the initiation of the consultationprocess, as suggested by International Association and the New York Department.The Commission does not believe it should be the responsibility of potentialapplicants to inform agencies of the resource information and managementobjectives of their sister agencies. The resource agencies can and shouldprovide and discuss this information during the initial joint consultationmeeting. The Commission is not requiring applicants to include in their andSection;16.8(b)(1) information packages, the information on Federal and Indianlands and annual fees as requested by Montana Natural Resources. This informationwill be included by existing licensees in their applications pursuant toandSection; 16.10(b)(9); it is not necessary for the first stage of consultation.The Commission is not requiring compliance information to be provided tothe resource agencies, as suggested by the Michigan Department. This informationmust be made available to agencies and the public for inspection and copyingpursuant to andSection; 16.7(d)(1)(ii). Idaho Power's objections to the requirements of paragraph (b)(I)(v) regardingstreamflow and water regime information are not persuasive. This informationshould be easily available for projects that have been operating for years.Also, applicants can present this information graphically if that wouldaid its compilation and understanding. This is a requirement of existingregulations,\95\<NOTE/> and the Commission is not aware of applicants' having difficultyin complying with it.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\95\ <T3>See </T3>18 CFR 4.38(b)(1)(v) (1988). Finally, the Commission rejects Niagara Mohawk's request that andSection;16.8(b)(1) (i), (ii), and (iii) be conditioned with the phrase ``to theextent known.'' The Commission recognizes that applicants may not knowthe final configuration of their projects at the time they are requiredto provide the andSection; 16.8(b)(1) information package, and may wish tomodify their projects during the course of completing the application process.However, resource agencies must be provided with some idea of the applicant'sdevelopment plan or plans at the beginning of the consultation process,in order to be able to determine what studies and other information arerequired. Insertion of Niagara Mohawk's suggested language would allowapplicants to avoid   entirely the obligation to inform agencies of theirdevelopment plans, and therefore is inappropriate. Of course, as just mentioned,applicants are not wedded to proposals discussed in the information packageand may modify those proposals during the course of the application andconsultation process.\96\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\96\ The Interior Department requests that applicants includein their andSection; 16.8(b)(1) information package the statement requiredby 18 CFR 4.301(a) (1988) indicating whether the potential applicant willbe applying for an exemption or a license involving a new dam or diversion.This request is reasonable and andSection; 16.8(b)(1) is being appropriatelymodified (see new andSection; 16.8(b)(I)(vii)). The Commerce Department requeststhat the word ``significant'' be eliminated from potential applicants'requirement to identify resources in andSection; 16.8(b)(1)(iv). The Commissionrejects this recommendation, since it may be impossible to identify everypotentially affected resource at the time the andSection; 16.8(b)(1) informationpackage is provided. <T3>c. </T3><T3>Joint Meetings. </T3>The majority of the commenters supported the conceptof joint consultation, pointing to the fact that joint consultation shouldreduce the instances of inconsistent or conflicting resource agency requestsand recommendations. However, a number of commenters contend that it wouldnot be appropriate or desirable to require joint consultation in everyinstance. EEI suggests that applicants should be provided with the option of consultingwith agencies jointly or individually, as currently permitted by andSection;4.38. EEI has reservations as to whether joint consultation would be workablein all cases, since state and Federal agencies are sometimes located indifferent cities and some projects require consultation with agencies of more than one state. EEI indicates that the use of conference calls, asprovided for in proposed andSection; 16.8(b)(2) and elsewhere in andSection;16.8, is not an adequate substitute for agencies unable to attend a jointmeeting, due to their inherent communication difficulties.\97\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\97\ Similar comments regarding the joint consultation proposaland the need to provide applicants with the option of joint or individualconsultation are expressed by Alabama Power, the Department of Commerce,the Interior Department, Friends of the Earth, Great Northern, MontanaPower, PGandamp;E, Puget Sound Power, Southern California Edison, WashingtonWildlife, Wisconsin Utilities, and Washington Power. International Association,New York Electric, and Washington Wildlife agree with EEI that conferencecalls are not an adequate substitute for face-to-face meetings. Several commenters\98\<NOTE/> suggest that, if joint consultation is required or elected,applicants be required to consult jointly only with agencies having similarareas of interest, expertise, or responsibility. They point out, for example,that no purpose would be served by requiring a state historic preservationagency to attend meetings on fishery issues. Puget Sound Power and SouthernCalifornia Edison suggest that, if joint consultation is required, it belimited to the first meeting.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\98\ EEI, Great Northern, Idaho Power, PGandamp;E, WisconsinUtilities, and Washington Power. The Commission agrees that joint consultation with all consulted agenciesduring all stages of the consultation process may be impracticable. However,potential applicants should not have the option of deciding whether theywill use joint or individual consultation, as requested by EEI and others.The Commission believes that the initial consultation meeting pursuantto andSection; 16.8(b)(2) should be held with all relevant agencies. Thiswill provide each agency with an understanding of the interrelationshipof resources, and the impacts a condition it may request might have ona resource within the purview of another agency. The meetings held underandSection; 16.8(c) \99\<NOTE/> to resolve disagreements following the submittal of draftapplications and agency comments thereon should be attended by all agencieswith similar or related areas of interest, expertise, or responsibility.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\99\ See Part IV.H.3., <T3>infra, </T3>for further discussion of the joint meeting and other provisionsof the second stage of agency consultation. In accordance with the above, the Commission is modifying andSection; 16.8as follows. First, andSection; 16.8(b)(2) is being revised to require onlya single joint meeting with all pertinent resource agencies during thefirst stage of agency consultation. Second, the Commission is modifyingproposed andSection; 16.8(c)(7) \100\<NOTE/> to specify that meetings to resolve substantive disagreementsunder the second stage of agency consultation must be joint ones attendedby all agencies with similar or related areas of interest, expertise, orresponsibility. Finally, the Commission is adding a new andSection; 16.8(h)to clarify that applicants may hold meetings with resource agencies otherthan the single joint meeting required by andSection; 16.8(b)(2) and anyjoint meeting held to resolve disagreements under stage-two consultation.This new paragraph does not require joint consultation; rather, it requiresa potential applicant, prior to holding an additional meeting with a resourceagency, to inform all agencies with similar or related areas of interest,expertise, or responsibility of the meeting so that they will be able toattend if they choose.\101\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\100\ This final rule redesignates andSection; 16.8(c)(7) asandSection; 16.8(c)(6).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\101\ The reference to agencies with ``related'' areas ofinterest in new paragraph (h) and in the provision pertaining to second-stagejoint meetings is intended to encompass agencies with an interest in orresponsibility over a resource that may be impacted as a result of an actiontaken with regard to another resource. For example, an agency with an interestin whitewater recreation potential in a project's bypass reach could beconsidered an agency with a related interest in cases where the applicantfor the project is to meet with a fishery agency to discuss instream flowsin the project's bypass reach. The Commission clarifies, however, that andSection; 16.8(h) does not applyto every communication between a potential applicant and a resource agency.Telephone calls or meetings between a potential applicant and a resourceagency to clarify minor technical or procedural points regarding an agency'srequest for a study or information, or to otherwise discuss minor issues,do not trigger the requirements of andSection; 16.8(h). Thus, potential applicantswill not have to notify other agencies as required by andSection; 16.8(h)with regard to such minor contacts with an agency. The Commission agrees with the comments regarding the advantages of face-to-facemeetings over conference calls. It was not the Commission's intention toimply that conference calls could be substituted for face-to-face jointmeetings; rather, the   intent was that conference calls could be usedto a limited degree to allow an agency to participate in a required jointmeeting it was unable to attend in person. In order to avoid confusionon this point, the Commission is revising andSection; 16.8 to eliminate referencesto conference calls. However, this action should not be construed as aprohibition on conference calls; in appropriate circumstances conferencecalls can be used to allow a resource agency to participate in a requiredjoint meeting. <T3>d. Timing and Procedures. </T3>As discussed previously, proposed andSection;16.8(b)(1)(vi) required potential applicants to include in their andSection;16.8(b)(1) information packages a tentative schedule and location for thefirst-stage joint consultation meeting. Proposed andSection; 16.8(b)(2) requiredpotential applicants to hold a joint meeting after each agency had 30 daysin which to review the andSection; 16.8(b)(1) information package. A numberof the commenters objected to, or sought clarification of, these provisions.American Rivers states that the proposed provisions are vague on the issueof who would set the time and place of the joint meetings, and suggeststhat potential applicants should be made responsible for setting up themeetings. Wildlife Federation suggests that the provision be clarifiedto specify that the meetings be scheduled at a time and place agreeableto the agencies involved. The Michigan Department and Friends of the Earthalso suggest that the provision be revised to require applicants to consultwith the agencies to arrive at mutually agreeable dates for consultationmeetings, while several commenters \102\<NOTE/> object to the apparent unilateral ability of applicants toestablish meeting schedules.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\102\ Washington Fisheries, Columbia Commission, the Departmentof Commerce, and Seattle Light. Similar comments were made by the InteriorDepartment.The Interior Department objects to the provision's silence on the issueof advance notification to the agencies, and suggests that written noticesand agendas be provided two weeks in advance. American Rivers suggeststhat applicants be required to provide notification to agencies five toten days in advance of any scheduled meeting. Montana Natural Resourcesrecommends that applicants be required to provide agencies with writtennotice at least ten days in advance, while Friends of the Earth suggestsa 15-day notification period. Finally, the South Carolina Department suggeststhat the tentative schedule required by proposed andSection; 16.8(b)(1)(vi)be sent to agencies by certified mail at least 30 days in advance of themeeting. The Commission agrees that potential applicants should consult with resourceagencies after submitting the information package in order to arrive atmutually agreeable dates and places for andSection; 16.8(b)(2) joint meetings,and should provide them with advance written notices and agendas. Thiswill assist the agencies in managing their workload and determining whichpersonnel should attend the meetings. Accordingly, the Commission is replacingthe provision requiring inclusion of a  tentative schedule in the andSection;16.8(b)(1) information package. The new provisions require potential applicantsto consult with the resource agencies in the scheduling of joint meetings,and to provide them with written notice of the time and place of the meetingsat least 15 days in advance, together with written agendas of the issuesto be discussed.\103\<NOTE/> The provision requiring advance notification to the Commissionis being clarified to require that written notice and a written agendabe provided 15 days in advance. Finally, conforming provisions are beingadded to the portion of andSection; 16.8(c) pertaining to joint meetingsto resolve disputes during second-stage consultation,\104\<NOTE/> and to new andSection; 16.8(h).\105\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\103\ <T3>See</T3> andSection; 16.8(b)(2)(ii). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\104\ <T3>See</T3> andSection; 16.8(c)(6)(ii). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\105\ The Commission believes that the 15-day notice reasonablybalances the need for advance notice to the agencies with the need forthe consultation process to proceed expeditiously. Accordingly, it rejectsthe South Carolina Department's suggestion that 30 days advance noticebe provided. The Commission is not aware of any problem regarding agenciesfailing to receive notices from applicants in a timely manner; therefore,it sees no need to adopt the South Carolina Department's suggestion thatthe notices be sent by certified mail. Many of the commenters object to andSection; 16.8(b)(2)'s provision thatjoint meetings be held after each agency has had 30 days in which to reviewthe andSection; 16.8(b)(1) information package. They contend that additionaltime is needed for the agencies to review the information prior to thefirst joint meeting. They suggest that the agencies be provided with 60days to review the information.\106\<NOTE/> American Rivers suggests that the period be extended to 60days or the section clarified to state that the 30-day period now specifiedwould begin running on the date the agencies actually receive the information.Wildlife Federation suggests that the time period be extended to 60 daysor agencies be allowed to obtain 30-day extensions.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\106\ Connecticut Commission, Friends of the Earth, InternationalAssociation, Michigan Department, Montana Natural Resources, New York Department,Washington Fisheries, Washington Wildlife, EEI and Rochester Gas. Trout Unlimited suggests that extensions of this time period and the otherconsultation deadlines in andSection; 16.8 be permitted in complex cases.The Department of Commerce recommends either that the period be extendedto 60 days or a procedure for extensions be established. The Interior Departmentsuggests that the 30-day period run from the date agencies receive allof the information required by andSection; 16.8(b)(1). The Commission believes that the 30-day period specified in the NOPR will,in most cases, provide agencies with adequate time to familiarize themselveswith proposed projects prior to the first-stage joint consultation meetings.However, the Commission recognizes that, because of heavy workload or thecomplexity of a case, agencies may sometimes find it difficult to adequatelyprepare for a joint meeting within 30 days. In order to accommodate such situations, the Commission is revising proposedandSection; 16.8(b)(2) to specify that a potential applicant must hold thefirst-stage joint meeting not earlier than 30 days, but not later than60 days, following the submittal of the andSection; 16.8(b)(1) informationpackage. This extended window will allow applicants to accommodate reasonableagency requests for additional time to prepare for the initial joint meeting.However, the Commission stresses the cooperative nature of the consultationprocess, and the need for expeditious agency responses to applicants' requests.Consequently, the Commission hopes and expects that the resource agencieswill not abuse the extended period for initial joint meetings by insistingon the maximum period for review in all cases. Conversely, the Commissionfully expects potential applicants to accommodate reasonable agency requests.The Commission declines to permit formal extensions of the time in whichto conduct the andSection; 16.8(b)(2) joint meeting. A clear non-extendabledeadline for the andSection; 16.8(b)(2) joint meeting is required in orderto have the expeditious consultation required in relicensing proceedingsand meet the filing deadlines mandated by ECPA. The additional time provided,together with diligent and good faith efforts on the part of the resourceagencies, should obviate any need for extensions.\107\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\107\ As discussed elsewhere herein, the Commission is revisingthe dispute resolution provisions to permit resource agencies to referdisputes regarding any first-stage consultation issue to the Director forresolution. Thus, if an applicant has not provided a resource agency withthe information required by andSection; 16.8(b)(1) and therefore has hinderedthe agency's ability to prepare for the joint meeting, the agency can referthe matter to the Director and, depending on his resolution, the deadlinefor the andSection; 16.8(b)(2) joint meeting may be extended.The Commission is also clarifying that the 30-to-60 day period will bemeasured from the date of the applicant's letter transmitting the andSection;16.8(b)(1) information package to the resource agencies. This date is selectedin lieu of the date of receipt by the agencies, as advocated by some ofthe commenters, since it provides an easily recognizable triggering pointfor the time period. As indicated previously, proposed andSection; 16.8(b)(3) specifies that,30 days after the andSection; 16.8(b)(2) joint meeting, the resource agencieswill provide a potential applicant with written comments identifying theirfinal determination of necessary studies or information to be providedby the applicant. However, this section also specifies that the 30-dayperiod would not begin running until ``there is agreement by all participantsthat all the information required by andSection; 16.8(b)(1) has been provided.''A number of objections were made to the 30-day deadline and the requirementfor agreement on the andSection; 16.8(b)(1) information. Great Northern recommends that the provision be revised to provide thatthe deadline for agency comments be measured from the date of the jointconsultation meeting, and not from the point that all of the agencies agreethat the andSection; 16.8(b)(1) information has been provided. Accordingto Great Northern, the current provision will allow a single agency todelay the entire consultation process. Great Northern contends that theagreement language is not necessary, since applicants will provide allof the andSection; 16.8(b)(1) information initially so as to avoid agencyrequests for unnecessary studies. EEI also requests deletion of the agreement language, contending that itwill lead to confusion and invite delay. EEI contends that this agreementlanguage is unnecessary, since the Commission's current consultation regulationsin andSection; 4.38 do not require it and EEI is not aware of any disputesthat have arisen over the submittal of initial consultation information.Georgia Power suggests that the agreement language be eliminated and thedispute resolution process be available for disputes regarding the sufficiencyof the andSection; 16.8(b)(2) information package.\108\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\108\ Similar concerns with the proposed agreement languageare expressed by National Hydropower, Idaho Power, Southern CaliforniaEdison, PGandamp;E, and Washington Power.American Rivers suggests that andSection; 16.8(b)(3) be revised to clarifythat it is up to the resource agencies to determine when all of the requiredandSection; 16.8(b)(1) information has been provided, and that the deadlinefor agency responses be measured from the point when all agencies agreethat all of the information has been provided. Washington Wildlife contendsthat the agreement language is very important. The Interior Departmentindicates that its experience is that not all applicants provide adequateinitial consultation information, and recommends that the provision beclarified to specify what happens when an applicant and an agency do notagree that all requested information has been provided. The Interior Departmentalso states that information not referenced in andSection; 16.8(b)(2) maybe necessary for the agencies to recommend studies and that, if an applicantdoes not agree to provide this supplemental information initially, an agencywill be forced to request it when it submits its comment letter. Finally,the Department of Commerce contends that firststage consultation shouldnot be considered complete until all andSection; 16.8(b)(1) information isprovided. The vast majority of the commenters recommend that the 30-day responseperiod for resource agencies be extended, indicating that the period istoo short to allow resource agencies to formulate accurate and responsivestudy requests and that the 30-day limit will prompt boilerplate studyrequests. A number of commenters \109\<NOTE/> recommend that the period be extended to 60 days. Some recommendthat it be extended to 90 days.\110\<NOTE/> Wildlife Federation suggests that either the period be extendedto 60 days or extensions of the current 30-day period be provided for inindividual cases. Montana Natural Resources suggests that the period beextended to 45 days in single dam projects and to 60 days in multiple damprojects. The Wisconsin Department suggests that the provision be revisedto provide for a 60- to 75-day negotiated period. The Interior Departmentsuggests that either the period be extended to 60 days or the agenciesbe provided with an opportunity to obtain a single 30- to 45-day extension.Finally, American Rivers suggests that the agencies be provided with theunilateral authority to extend the response period for up to 90 days.\111\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\109\ Connecticut Commission, International Association, NewYork Department, Trout Unlimited, EEI, PGandamp;E, Friends of the Earth,Alabama Power, and Public Pool. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\110\ Washington Wildlife, Southern California Edison, andGreat Lakes Commission. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\111\ Concerns about the shortness of the response periodwere also expressed by Maine Office, Montana Fish and Wildlife, Great Northern,Michigan Department and Washington Fisheries.In response to the concerns expressed by the commenters, the Commissionis extending the resource agency response period from 30 to 60 days. Thiswill provide a more reasonable time period for the resource agencies torespond and will establish a uniform deadline for all proceedings, thusavoiding the uncertainties inherent in some of the commenters' suggestionsfor optional extension periods. The Commission is also eliminating the requirement that all of the agenciesmust agree that all of the andSection; 16.8(b)(1) information has been provided.The new 60-day response period is measured from the date of the andSection;16.8(b)(2) joint meeting. The Commission agrees with the commenters that the agreement language wouldcreate potential for delay and would allow a single resource agency tohold the consultation process hostage on a project. However, the Commissionrecognizes that there may be instances where a potential applicant failsto provide all of the required andSection; 16.8(b)(1) information and thatin such situations it would be inequitable and counter-productive to requireresource agencies to respond within 60 days. Accordingly, and as discussedin the next part hereof, the Commission is modifying the dispute resolutionprocess to permit resource agencies to refer any matter arising under thefirst stage of consultation to the Director for resolution. Consequently,agencies that believe they have not been provided with all of the andSection;16.8(b)(1) information may refer the issue to the Director for resolution,and possibly obtain an extension of time to file their responses underandSection; 16.8(b)(3).\112\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\112\ Section 16.8(b)(3) is redesignated as andSection; 16.8(b)(4)by this final rule.The Commission is also revising this provision to require the resourceagencies to include in their responses an explanation of the basis foreach request. This must include a discussion of: (1) Their understandingof the resource issues and their goals and objectives for these resources;(2) why each study methodology recommended by them is more appropriatethan other available methodology alternatives, including those identifiedby the applicant in its andSection; 16.8(b)(1) information package; (3) whythe use of each study methodology recommended by it is a generally acceptedpractice; and (4) how the data requested will be useful in meeting theirresource goals. This revision, suggested by PGandamp;E and Great Northern,will provide potential applicants with a better understanding of agencyrequests and should help reduce the potential for disputes.\113\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\113\ The word ``final'' is also being deleted from this provision.This is discussed in Part IV.H.3.c., <T3>infra.</T3>    e. <T3>Dispute Resolution. </T3>In the NOPR, the Commission proposed to permita potential applicant disagreeing with a resource agency, either as towhether a study is reasonable and necessary or as to the manner in whicha study should be performed, to refer the matter to the Director for resolution.However, proposed andSection; 16.8(b)(4) limited referrals to studies ormethods of conducting studies not routinely used on the type of projectproposed.\114\<NOTE/> That section also provided that an applicant that did notrefer a dispute to the Director, or that disagreed with the Director'sresolution, did not have to conduct the requested study or perform it inthe requested manner, but had to fully explain in its application the basisfor its disagreement.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\114\ Proposed andSection; 16.8(b)(4)(i) (A) and (B). EEI suggests that any matter arising during the first stage of consultationbe subject to referral. EEI states that questions regarding what are considered``routine'' studies or methodologies will arise under the proposed version,and that it would aid the consultation process to make procedural issuessubject to resolution. Second, EEI recommends that potential applicantsbe given the option of either formally referring disputes to the Directorin writing or scheduling a conference call among the applicant, the disagreeingagency, and the Director or his designee to resolve the dispute. Third,EEI suggests that a 30-day time limit be placed on the Director to   resolvedisputes. Fourth, EEI requests that potential applicants be allowed toappeal Director dispute decisions to the Commission. Finally, EEI suggeststhat the disagreeing agency be permitted to file written responses to potentialapplicants' referrals, so that the Director will have all the informationnecessary to resolve disputes. A number of other commenters generally support EEI's request for expansionof the dispute resolution process to cover all matters arising during thefirst stage of consultation. These commenters \115\<NOTE/> point out that it is not clear what would be considered routinestudies in relicensing proceedings, and that a study that is generallyconsidered routine may be meaningless in the context of an individual case.They also reference the need for the Director to resolve disputes overrequested studies whose costs would outweigh the environmental or otherbenefits that could result from the studies.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\115\ Alabama Power, American River, Brazos, Georgia Power,Montana Power, National Hydropower, EPA, Puget Sound Power, Rochester Gas,Southern California Edison, Wisconsin Utilities, and Washington Power.Washington Fisheries supports the limitation of the dispute resolutionprocess to non-routine studies and methodologies, stating that this limitationwill curtail unnecessary and time-consuming challenges. Montana NaturalResources also supports the proposed limitation, but would refer routinestudy requests to the Director if they are repetitious, duplicative, orunduly burdensome to the applicant. Montana Power, the Michigan   Department,and the Interior Department request specification of what would be considereda routine study.\116\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\116\ Alabama Power, Southern California Edison, and WisconsinUtilities support EEI's suggestion regarding optional informal disputeresolution procedures, while Montana Power, the Maine Office, and PGandamp;Esupport EEI's suggestion that a time limit be placed on Director's decisions.Friends of the Earth supports EEI's suggestion that the Director's decisionsbe appealable to the Commission, while Montana Power requests that thispoint be clarified. Wildlife Federation suggests that andSection; 16.8(b)(4) be revised to specifythe standard the Director will use in resolving disputes, and recommendsthat the Director require a potential applicant to conduct any requestedstudy, unless the applicant can show that the study would be inconsistentwith the purposes of the FPA. Montana Natural Resources suggests that theprovision be broadened to allow resource agencies to refer disputes tothe Director. Some commenters \117\<NOTE/> recommend that resource agencies be afforded an opportunityto participate in the dispute resolution process or otherwise make knowntheir views on a referral. Finally, the EPA and Trout Unlimited suggestthat proposed andSection; 16.8(b)(4)(ii) be revised to require potentialapplicants either to conduct all studies found by the Director to be reasonable,or to resolve all disputes with agencies prior to filing their applications.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\117\ Washington Ecology, Washington Fisheries, WisconsinDepartment, and the Departments of Commerce and the Interior. The Commission finds persuasive the arguments for expansion of the typeof matters that can be referred to the Director for    resolution. Accordingly,the Commission is revising proposed andSection; 16.8(b)(4) (redesignatedandSection; 16.8(b)(5) by this final rule) to delete the reference to non-routinestudies, and to permit any disputes arising during the first stage of consultationto be referred to the Director for resolution.\118\<NOTE/> However, the Commission reiterates its concern that promptedthe use of the ``not routinely conducted'' language in the NOPR, that potentialapplicants not use the dispute resolution process to resolve minor or frivolousmatters. The Commission urges potential applicants and resource agenciesto cooperate during the consultation process to resolve study-related mattersamong themselves without resort to the dispute resolution process. If theCommission finds that potential applicants are using the process to attemptto avoid clearly reasonable study requests, the Commission will revisethe dispute resolution process.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\118\ <T3>See </T3>new andSection; 16.8(b)(5)(i). As discussed in Part IV.G.3.,<T3>supra</T3>, disputes regarding access to existing licensees' projectsunder andSection; 16.5 can be referred to the Director for resolution. Also,as proposed in the NOPR, under proposed andSection; 16.8(c)(4), disputesregarding studies requested after completion of the first stage of agencyconsultation can be referred to the Director for resolution. Revisionsto andSection; 16.8(b)(5) are being made to clarify this right.As suggested by Montana Natural Resources, the Commission is revising andSection;16.8(b)(5) to allow resource agencies to refer to the Director disputesover any matter arising during first-stage consultation. As pointed outby Wisconsin Public Service in its reply comments, this may lead to disruptiveexchanges between the Commission and resource agencies during the periodwhen potential applicants' resources would be better utilized in preparingapplications. Nevertheless, the Commission believes it is necessary toafford resource agencies this right in order to consider disputes arisingout of a potential applicant's failure to provide the information requiredby andSection; 16.8(b)(1). The Commission is also requiring potential applicantsand resource agencies to provide the other party with a copy of its referral,and to permit the other party to submit a written response within 15 days.\119\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\119\ <T3>See </T3>new andSection; 16.8(b)(5)(ii). The Commission is also clarifying (in new andSection; 16.8(b)(5)(iii)) thatall written submissions to the Director and written responses thereto pursuantto the dispute resolution provisions of andSection; 16.8(b)(5) must be filedwith the Commission's Secretary in accordance with the Commission's Rulesof Practice and Procedure. In addition, the Commission is specifying (innew andSection; 16.8(b)(5)(vi)) that the filing and acceptance of an applicationwill not be delayed, and an application will not be considered deficientor patently deficient pursuant to 18 CFR 4.32 (1988), merely because theapplication does not include a study or information found to be unreasonableor unnecessary by the Director pursuant to the dispute resolution procedures.The Commission declines to make the other suggested revisions to the disputeresolution process. As to the request for the establishment of an optionalinformal dispute resolution process, the Commission does not believe itis necessary to make such a process a part of its regulations. Potentialapplicants and resource agencies are always free to contact appropriateCommission staff to receive guidance and suggestions on how to resolvedisputes regarding studies and other information requests. However, theCommission believes that all actual decisions on referred matters shouldbe made by the Director on the basis of written submissions. Written documentationof the parties' views will reduce the possibility for misinterpretations,and are needed for review of filed applications in cases where applicantsdecline to follow the decision of the Director. With regard to the proposal to require the Director to act on referreddisputes within 30 days, the Commission acknowledges the need to have suchdisputes resolved expeditiously. However, as discussed elsewhere hereinin relation to similar requests, workload demands may prohibit the Directorfrom acting on such disputes within a specified deadline. Consequently,no deadline will be specified. The Commission is, however, instructingthe Director to make every effort to resolve referred disputes within 30days from receipt of all relevant information. The arguments advanced by EEI in support of the proposal to allow potentialapplicants to appeal the Director's decisions to the Commission are notwithout merit. As pointed out by EEI, the relicensing process may generatesignificant new study requests by resource agencies, the appropriatenessof which the Commission itself has not had an opportunity to address inthe past. Also as pointed out by EEI, the consequences of a potential applicant'sfailure to conduct a study found to be necessary by the Director as a resultof a dispute referral could be significant. It could lead to the rejectionof the application when it is filed and, if the 24-month filing deadlinefor relicense applications has passed, prevent the applicant from refilingits application. Despite the legitimate concerns expressed by EEI, the Commission believesit would be inappropriate to permit appeals to the Commission in thesesituations. First, while the Commission acknowledges applicants' desirefor certainty, appeals of such Director's decisions, except for those relatedto extensions of time, are clearly interlocutory. Second, the Director'sdecisions regarding studies and information are advisory and nonbinding.Upon analyzing the reasons set out in an applicant's filed applicationfor not doing a study he found to be necessary during the dispute resolutionprocess, together with the rest of the information contained in the application,the Director may decide that the disputed study is, in fact, not necessary.Third, insertion of the requested appeal provision could lead to a significantand potentially burdensome increase in the number of matters that mustbe considered by the Commission itself. Fourth, as discussed elsewhereherein,\120\<NOTE/> the Commission is clarifying one major study issue whichEEI references in support of its request. Finally, the Commission may entertainrequests for declaratory orders on such matters where the relevance ofthe issue raised to relicense applicants in general is so significant thatit would be appropriate to consider the matter despite its interlocutorynature.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\120\ <T3>See </T3>Part IV.H.3.b., <T3>infra.</T3>The Commission does not believe it is necessary to specify in the regulationsthe standard the Director will use in resolving first-stage consultationdisputes. Clearly, his decisions will be made case-by-case on the basisof whether the requested study is reasonable and necessary in relationto the resource goals and management objectives of the resource agencies,and whether it is a generally accepted practice for potential applicantsto use the methodology requested by an agency. The standard advocated byWildlife Federation is undefinable. Any study on a resource issue, or anothermatter the Commission must consider under its obligation to consider allaspects of the public interest, is related to the FPA and is thus ``consistent''with it, regardless of its reasonableness or necessity. Finally, the suggestions of Trout Unlimited and the EPA that potentialapplicants either conduct all studies found reasonable by the Directoror resolve all disputes prior to filing their applications are rejected.Those proposals either would remove an applicant's ability to make itsfull case against a requested study in its application or would allow asingle unreasonable resource agency to prevent the filing of an application.In a related matter, the Interior Department contends that studies it requestsin order to formulate fish and wildlife terms and conditions pursuant tosections 10(j) and 30(c) of the FPA \121\<NOTE/> should not be subject to the dispute resolution proceduresof andSection; 16.8(b)(5). According to Interior, since such studies arean integral part of providing recommendations and mandatory terms and conditionsunder these provisions of the FPA, the expertise of Interior's Fish andWildlife Service dictates that it alone have the ability to determine appropriatestudies. The Department of Commerce makes similar contentions regardingstudies necessary for the prescription of fishways pursuant to section18 of the FPA.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\121\ 16 U.S.C. 823a(c) (1982 and Supp. 1988). The InteriorDepartment suggests that the Commission clarify the regulations to specifywhether existing licensees that apply for exemptions would be subject tomandatory fish and wildlife conditions submitted by Fish and Wildlife Service,the National Marine Fisheries Service and appropriate state fish and wildlifeagencies pursuant to section 30(c) of the FPA. There is no need to revisethe regulations to specify this, since the applicability of mandatory conditioningauthority under section 30(c) of the FPA is clear from the requirementin andSection; 16.12 that existing licensees applying for exemptions complywith the Commission's exemption regulations, which reference mandatoryfish and wildlife conditions under section 30(c). The Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Marine Fisheries Service, andappropriate state fish and wildlife agencies have authority pursuant tosection 30(c) of the FPA to impose on exemptions, mandatory terms and conditionsto prevent loss of, or  damage to, fish and wildlife resources. However,the legislative history of ECPA, which added paragraph (j) to section 10of the FPA, clearly shows that section 10(j) does not give these agenciesmandatory conditioning authority.\122\<NOTE/> In any event, even when mandatory conditioning authoritysuch as under section 4(e) of the FPA is involved, the Commission retainsthe authority to determine which information and study requests are reasonablynecessary for the formulation of terms and conditions.\123\<NOTE/> Although mandatory conditioning authority may be involved,the final authority to act on license applications resides exclusivelywith the Commission. Thus, the Commission is vested with the exclusiveauthority to establish the process to be followed by applicants and todetermine the type and extent of the information needed to carry out theCommission's licensing responsibilities. Virtually any study request canbe claimed to be at least tangentially related to fish and wildlife resources.Since the exception advocated by the Departments of Commerce and Interiorcould essentially negate the whole dispute resolution process, the Commissiondeclines to make the revisions.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\122\ <T3>See </T3>H.R.

Finally, state and Federal fish and wildlife agencies, such as the Fishand Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service, in makingrecommendations regarding the conservation of fish and wildlife resourcespursuant to the Fish  and Wildlife Coordination Act (FWCA), are requiredto base those recommendations ``on surveys and investigations conductedby'' them.\124\<NOTE/> Thus, the FWCA imposes some obligation on these agenciesto affirmatively study fish and wildlife matters, and indicates that theburden of conducting such studies should not be shouldered entirely bypotential applicants for hydroelectric projects. Consequently, if an agencybelieves a study found to be unreasonable by the Director should be conducted,it may perform that study itself.\125\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\124\ <T3>See </T3>16 U.S.C. 662 (1982). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\125\ As discussed previously, the Commission is initiatinga rulemaking proceeding to develop formal procedures for integrating thesection 10(j) process into its licensing and relicensing processes. <T3>f. Termination of First-Stage Consultation. </T3>Proposed andSection;16.8(b)(5) specified that the first stage of consultation ends when allparticipating agencies provide the written comments required under theprovision being redesignated as andSection; 16.8(b)(4) herein. The intentof this provision was to have the first stage end at the deadline for submittalof agency comments specified in andSection; 16.8(b)(4). However, a numberof commenters \126\<NOTE/> indicate that proposed andSection; 16.8(b)(5) is vague on thispoint, and should be clarified to eliminate the suggestion that a resourceagency could delay the completion of first-stage consultation by withholdingits comments. The Commission agrees that the requested clarification shouldbe made and is revising andSection; 16.8(b)(5) (redesignated andSection; 16.8(b)(6)by this final rule) accordingly.\127\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\126\ EEI, Great Northern, Montana Power and Niagara Mohawk.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\127\ The Department of the Interior suggests that the firststage of consultation not end until specifically acknowledged by the resourceagencies, citing to the possibility that a potential applicant may nothave provided the agencies with sufficient information. The Commissionsees no need to make this revision since, as discussed previously, theregulations are being revised to allow resource agencies to refer disputesover such things as the adequacy of the andSection; 16.8(b)(1) informationpackage to the Director for resolution. <ITAG tagnum="28">Georgia Power suggests that resource agency information requests bemade subject to dispute resolution. Given the expansion of the disputeresolution process in this final rule to cover all matters arising duringthe first stage of agency consultation, there is no need to specificallyreference information requests. In any event, although the initially proposeddispute resolution process only referenced studies, all requests by agenciesfor information fall within the scope of the dispute resolution process.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">3. Second-Stage Consultation </ITAG>In the NOPR, the Commission proposed to require a potential applicant toconduct its own studies independently of any other applicant unless otherwiseagreed to by the applicants,\128\<NOTE/> and to specify that a potential applicant is not obligatedto share the results of a study with a competing applicant.\129\<NOTE/> The NOPR also required a potential applicant to perform allreasonable studies and obtain all information requested during the firststage of consultation either before filing the application or after thelicense is issued, depending on the type of study involved.\130\<NOTE/>   <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\128\ Proposed andSection; 16.8(c)(1). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\129\ Proposed andSection; 16.8(c)(2). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\130\ Proposed andSection; 16.8(c)(3).The Commission also specified in the NOPR that a potential applicant mustpromptly initiate any study requested by a resource agency following theconclusion of the first stage of agency consultation, unless the Directordetermined that the study request was unreasonable or unnecessary pursuantto the dispute resolution process.\131\<NOTE/> However, the NOPR indicated that the results of any suchstudy would be treated as additional information, and that the filing andacceptance of an application would not be delayed because the study wasnot complete before the application was filed.\132\<NOTE/>   <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\131\ Proposed andSection; 16.8(c)(4)(i). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\132\ Proposed andSection; 16.8(c)(4) (ii) and (iii).The NOPR also required a potential applicant to provide each resource agencywith a copy of its draft application, the results of all studies requestedby the relevant agency, and a request for review and comment.\133\<NOTE/> Under the NOPR, resource agencies were to have 60 days inwhich to provide applicants with written comments on the draft application.\134\<NOTE/> If the written comments indicated that a resource agencyhad a substantive disagreement with a potential applicant's proposed mitigationand enhancement measures, the potential applicant was to hold a joint meetingor conference call with all pertinent resource agencies to discuss, andto attempt to reach agreement on, the applicant's plans for   environmentalmitigation and enhancement measures, with written notice of the meetingprovided in advance to the Commission.\135\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\133\ Proposed andSection; 16.8(c)(5). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\134\ Proposed andSection; 16.8(c)(6). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\135\ Proposed andSection; 16.8(c)(7). The NOPR also required the development of documents detailing potentialapplicants' and resource agencies' areas of agreement and disagreement,\136\<NOTE/> and that applicants describe areas of disagreement in theirapplications.\137\<NOTE/> Finally, the NOPR provided that potential applicants couldfile their applications either following the submittal of agency commentsin cases where no substantive disagreements were raised, or following theholding of joint meetings or conference calls in cases where substantivedisagreements were raised.\138\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\136\ Proposed andSection; 16.8(c)(8). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\137\ Proposed andSection; 16.8(c)(9). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\138\ Proposed andSection; 16.8(c)(10). <T3>a. Independent Studies. </T3>The provisions of proposed andSection; 16.8(c)(1) and (c)(2) were addressed by a number of the commenters. Great Northern,Public Pool, and Rochester Gas support these provisions, indicating thatthey will discourage competitors from simply duplicating the studies andapplication of the applicant that goes through the consultation and applicationprocess first. Conversely, the Northern California Agency contends thatthe provisions establish a bad policy, since there are occasions when thenature of the study or resource itself makes a single study advisable,such as  interviewing elderly persons regarding cultural information andtagging and monitoring limited deer populations. Montana Natural Resourcesstates that it may be desirable for the Commission to require cooperativestudies by competitors in certain cases, while the Department of Commercesuggests that cooperative studies should be encouraged. The Commission is deleting proposed paragraphs (1) and (2) from andSection;16.8(c). Although the Commission continues to believe that applicants shouldgenerally conduct studies independently of each other, there are situationssuch as those referenced above where cooperative studies would be appropriate.However, the Commission does not believe a reasonable and readily enforceableregulatory provision encompassing all potential situations regarding cooperativestudies can be developed. Furthermore, the proposed provisions are inconsistent with existing Commissionpolicy. As discussed in <T3>WV Hydro, Inc. and the City of St. Marys, West Virginia,\139\</T3><NOTE/> the Commission will not reject an application for containingmaterial duplicated from another application, but will leave to the partiesthe resolution, in the appropriate legal forum, of the consequences ofreproducing copyrighted material. The proposed provisions, by adding tothe Commission's regulations an implicit prohibition against the copyingof material and studies, would be directly contrary to this policy.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\139\ 45 FERC andpara; 61,220 (1988). Although the Commission is deleting these provisions, it is not requiringpotential applicants to provide copies of their studies to potential competitors.Potential applicants are encouraged to do their own work in developingtheir applications, instead of merely copying a competitor's materials.An application failing to contain a necessary study or other informationmay be found to be deficient. In addition, and as discussed in <T3>WV Hydro</T3>, <T3>supra</T3>, the fact that a competitor copied another applicant's materialmay be relevant to a Commission decision on the merits of the competingapplications. The determination of what weight, if any, to give to copyingwill be done on a case-by-case basis. Situations may arise where the magnitudeof the copying may lead the Commission to conclude that the applicant haslittle understanding of the proposed project and thus may have difficultyin constructing, operating, and maintaining its project safely and in accordancewith the terms and conditions of any license that might be issued. <T3>b. Type of Studies. </T3>Many of the commenters \140\<NOTE/> object to the classification in proposed andSection; 16.8(c)(3)of which studies must be completed prior to the filing of applicationsand which ones can be conducted after license issuance. They contend thatthe classification impermissibly allows the deferral to the post-licensingphase of  studies that must be completed prior to licensing. Accordingto some of these commenters, andSection; 16.8(c)(3) violates the decisionof the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in <T3>Confederated Tribes of the Yakima Indian Nation </T3>v. <T3>FERC (Yakima);</T3>\141\<NOTE/> according to the commenters, it would allow the Commissionto avoid resolving fishery and other issues prior to licensing throughthe use of open-ended license study articles. These commenters find particularlyobjectionable the references in proposed andSection; 16.8(c)(3)(ii) to turbine-relatedfish mortality studies and studies to refine project operation or modifyproject facilities. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\140\ <T3>See</T3>, <T3>e.g., </T3>the comments of American Rivers, EPA, Department of Interior,Department of Commerce, Michigan Department, Wildlife Federation, WashingtonFisheries, and Washington Wildlife.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\141\ 746 F.2d 466 (9th Cir. 1984), <T3>cert. denied, </T3>471 U.S. 1116 (1985). The Commission is fully cognizant of its obligation under the FPA to considerand resolve fish, wildlife, and other resource issues prior to issuinglicenses, and will continue to meet this obligation in relicensing proceedings.However, as the Commission has explained, the FPA, as interpreted by <T3>Yakima, </T3>does not require the resolution of every detail regardingresource issues prior to licensing.\142\<NOTE/> Rather, the Commission is required only to responsibly evaluatethe effect of a project on fishery and other resources and to considerpossible protection, mitigation, and enhancement measures prior to actingon an application. Open-ended license conditions requiring further studiesand actions enable the Commission to assess the    effectiveness of mitigationmeasures, to fine-tune project facilities and operations, to secure informationthat cannot be obtained prior to license issuance, or to address new circumstancesthat may arise in the future. They are appropriate as long as they arenot used as a substitute for reasoned pre-licensing evaluation of fisheryand other issues.\143\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\142\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>Delmar Wagner, 44 FERC andpara; 61,213 at 61,801 (1988).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\143\ <T3>Id. </T3>The language of proposed andSection; 16.8(c)(3)(ii) (redesignated andSection;16.8(c)(1)(ii) by this final rule), was taken verbatim from the Commission'scurrent consultation regulations.\144\<NOTE/> It was not intended to sanction the use of post-licensingstudies in situations where the studies should be prepared prior to licensing.The Commission will continue to meet its obligations under the FPA, asinterpreted by <T3>Yakima.  </T3><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\144\ <T3>See </T3>18 C.F.R. 4.38(b)(2)(ii) (1988).  The Commission is deleting the reference to turbine-related fish mortalitystudies as an example of a study that can only be conducted after constructionor operation of proposed facilities. This is not a good example becausethese studies can be conducted prior to licensing in cases where the applicantproposes to continue to use the existing turbines without modification.\145\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\145\ Post-licensing turbine mortality studies would be appropriatein cases where the use of new or additional turbines is proposed.  The Commission sees no need, however, to delete the reference to studiesto refine project operations or modify    project facilities. The provisionwas merely intended to address studies to fine-tune project operationsand facilities approved in a new license as a result of post-licensingoperating experience. Studies regarding the possible modification of existingfacilities and operations would be required prior to licensing. Washington Wildlife suggests that andSection; 16.8(c) be modified to specifythe routine studies the Commission believes are necessary in all cases.Washington Fisheries and the Department of Commerce recommend that theintroductory sentence be changed to reference studies ``requested by agenciesunless waived by the Director.'' They also recommend that the phrase ``suitablemitigation measures'' in proposed andSection; 16.8(c)(3)(i)(B) be subjectto the phrase ``recommended by agencies under section 10(j) of the FPAor specified by agencies under section 18 of the FPA.'' Finally, MontanaPower suggests that a provision be added to allow applicants to completestudies after filing their applications, but before licensing, if a studyrequest by a resource agency would take longer to complete than the timebetween the conclusion of the first stage of consultation and the applicationfiling deadline. The changes to the introductory sentence of proposed andSection; 16.8(c)(3)recommended by Washington Fisheries and the Department of Commerce arereasonable clarifying changes and are being made. The Commission declines,however, to identify ``routine'' studies, as requested by Washington Wildlife.Due to the differences between various types of projects, it is impossibleto generically identify routine studies applicable to all projects. The Commission also declines to make the references to sections 10(j) and18 of the FPA requested by Washington Fisheries and the Department of Commerce.Reasonable studies needed by state and Federal fish and wildlife agenciesto recommend terms and conditions for the protection, mitigation, and enhancementof fish and wildlife resources pursuant to the FWCA as referenced in section10(j) would clearly fall within the scope of andSection; 16.8(b). But andSection;16.8(c)(3)(i)(B) (redesignated andSection; 16.8(c)(1)(i)(B) by this finalrule) is not limited to fish and wildlife resources. Referencing section10(j), as requested by these two agencies, would impermissibly excludeother resources from the scope of the provision and therefore is inappropriate.\146\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\146\ The Commerce Department and some of the other commenterssuggest that references to ``mitigation'' or ``mitigation and enhancementmeasures'' at various places in the proposed regulations be modified tospecify ``protection, mitigation, and enhancement measures'' so as to trackthe language of section 10(j) of the FPA. Since it would be appropriateto follow the statutory language of section l0(j) pertaining to fish andwildlife resources, and since protection, mitigation, and enhancement measuresmay be appropriate for any resource, the suggested revisions are beingmade where appropriate. Montana Power's suggestion that all referencesto ``mitigation and enhancement'' be modified to ``mitigation and/or enhancement''so as to make clear that enhancement of resources is not required in allcases need not be followed, since the conjunctive reference to enhancementis not intended to mean that enhancement is required in every case, onlythat it is an alternative that may be appropriate.The Commission is also adding a new andSection; 16.8(c)(1)(ii) \147\<NOTE/> to address the extended study situation mentioned by MontanaPower. The new provision specifies that studies that cannot be completedprior to the application filing deadline can be completed after filingonly if an applicant initiates formal consultation not later than fouryears prior to the expiration date of the existing license. This will ensurethat potential applicants will not delay the initiation of formal consultationin order to push the requirement for conducting studies to the post-filingstage.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\147\ Proposed andSection; 16.8(c)(3)(ii) is redesignated asandSection; 16.8(c)(1)(iii) by this final rule. In a related matter, several commenters \148\<NOTE/> request that redesignated andSection; 16.8(c)(1) be revisedto require potential applicants to gather information and conduct studiesregarding the condition of resources in the project area that existed priorto the initial licensing and construction of the project. According tothe Department of Commerce, <T3>Yakima, supra</T3>, requires the Commission to collect this ``baseline''information to evaluate project impacts as if the project had never beenconstructed.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\148\ The Departments of Commerce and the Interior, EPA, WildlifeFederation, and Washington Wildlife. EEI, in its reply comments, vigorously objects to this suggestion, arguingthat in enacting ECPA Congress specifically rejected the idea that theCommission should ignore existing projects and assess environmental valuespursuant to a   hypothetical pre-project baseline environment.\149\<NOTE/> Furthermore, EEI indicates that the collection and analysisof baseline data would require such a high degree of speculation that theexercise would be fruitless in most, if not all, cases. Similar objectionswere expressed in the reply comments filed by Georgia Power and WisconsinPublic Service. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\149\ In support of its argument, EEI quotes the followingstatement from the ECPA Conference Report: <ITAG tagnum="28">In exercising its responsibilities in relicensing, the conferees expectFERC to take into account existing structures and facilities in providingfor these nonpower and nondevelopmental values. No one expects FERC torequire an applicant to tear down an existing project. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">H.R. Rep. No. 99-934, 99th Cong., 2nd Sess. 22 (1986). </ITAG>The Commission agrees with EEI that it would be inappropriate to requirepotential applicants to gather such baseline data. First, and as indicatedby EEI, it is highly doubtful that attempts to ascertain the status ofvarious resources prior to the time a 50-year-old project was constructedwould result in the development of any useful information. Second, while<T3>Yakima </T3>clearly requires the Commission to evaluate resource impactsprior to licensing, the Commission sees nothing in that decision that requiresit either to pretend that current projects do not exist, or to requireapplicants to gather information to recreate a 50-year old environmentalbase upon which to make present day development decisions. In deciding whether (or under what conditions) to relicense a project,the Commission must determine whether the resources should still be used(totally or partially) for the generation of electricity. That determinationis based on weighing the relevant beneficial uses of the resource, andtaking into account appropriate measures to, <T3>inter alia</T3>, protect, mitigate and enhance fish and wildlife resources.In so doing, the Commission can evaluate whether enhancement of fish andwildlife resources would be appropriate. Enhancement may in many casesconstitute a reduction of the negative impacts attributable to the projectsince its construction. However, this evaluation and consideration of theappropriateness of requiring enhancement measures is done in the contextof today's environment and in relation to today's needs and problems, notin the context of the world as it existed 50 years ago. Consequently, theCommission declines to make the requested revisions regarding baselinestudies, and potential applicants do not have to routinely conduct suchstudies if requested to do so by resource agencies. Finally, and as discussed previously, the FWCA imposes some obligationon state and Federal fish and wildlife agencies to affirmatively studyfish and wildlife matters. Consequently, at least in the speculative areaof baseline information, the agencies themselves should conduct any studiesthey feel are necessary.<T3>c. Additional Studies. </T3>As indicated previously, proposed andSection;16.8(c)(4) provides that potential applicants must promptly initiate anystudy requested by a resource agency after the conclusion of the firststage of agency consultation, unless the study is determined by the Directorto be unreasonable or unnecessary pursuant to the dispute resolution procedures.However, proposed andSection; 16.8(c)(4) also specifies that the study resultswill be treated as additional information, and that the filing and acceptanceof the application will not be delayed because the study was not completebefore the application was filed. Many of the commenters object to requiring potential applicants to conductstudies requested by resource agencies following first-stage consultation.They assert that this runs counter to the expeditious consultation purposesof proposed andSection; 16.8, renders meaningless the deadlines for agencyactions to be established by andSection; 16.8, and is inconsistent with therequirement in proposed andSection; 16.8(b)(3) that ``final'' determinationsof requested studies must be made within 30 (now 60) days of the initialjoint consultation meeting. EEI suggests that the provision be changedto specify that potential applicants ``may'' conduct the requested studiesin such situations, and that such studies should be required only if orderedby the Commission itself. PGandamp;E recommends that the provision be modifiedto require resource agencies to submit requests for late studies to theDirector, who would then determine if the study should be conducted.\150\<NOTE/> Niagara Mohawk suggests that the provision be clarified asto whether applicants can challenge such requests pursuant to the disputeresolution process and what procedures will be followed for such disputes.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\150\ Concerns or proposals similar to those advanced by EEIand PGandamp;E are expressed by Great Northern, Montana Power, Niagara Mohawk,Rochester Gas, Wisconsin Utilities, and others. The Department of Commerce, Friends of the Earth, and Washington Wildlifesupport the additional study provisions of proposed andSection; 16.8(c)(4),indicating that the results of initial studies prepared at the requestof resource agencies sometimes show the need for additional studies. TheEPA and Seattle Light agree that additional studies may be necessary afterthe first stage of consultation, but the EPA and Washington Fisheries notethat the use of the word ``final'' in proposed andSection; 16.8(b)(3) wouldseem to prohibit such additional studies. Finally, several commenters\151\<NOTE/> object to the provision's statement that the filing and acceptanceof an application will not be delayed because of the failure of an applicantto complete such an additional study prior to filing its application.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\151\ EPA, Washington Fisheries, Great Lakes Commission, andthe Wisconsin Department. The Commission believes that the requirement that potential applicantspromptly initiate studies requested by agencies after the conclusion ofthe first stage of agency consultation is necessary. The Commission's experienceis that the results of initially-prepared studies frequently point to theneed for    additional studies required for reasoned evaluation of proposedprojects. While retaining this provision may require additional work forpotential applicants in some cases, the Commission believes that this provisionwill actually help to speed the review process along. In those cases wheresuch additional studies are necessary, the study work would be initiatedearlier than if required to be conducted as part of a Commission staffadditional information request. The Commission believes that in most casesthe resource agencies will not abuse their right to request additionalstudies, since it is in their best interest to ensure that potential applicantsare informed of needed studies at the earliest possible time. In accordance with the above, the provisions of proposed andSection; 16.8(c)(4)are being retained (as andSection; 16.8(c)(2)), and the inconsistent referenceto ``final'' determinations of agency-requested studies in proposed andSection;16.8(b)(3) (now andSection; 16.8(b)(4)) is eliminated. Also, to address theconcerns expressed by Niagara Mohawk, the Commission is making clear thatapplicants' challenges to such additional studies are subject to the disputeresolution procedures of andSection; 16.8(b)(5). Thus, potential applicantscan always challenge the need for any additional study. Finally, in responseto the apparent concerns of the EPA, Washington Fisheries, and the WisconsinDepartment, the provision's statement that the filing and acceptance ofan application will not be delayed does not mean that the Commission willproceed to act on an application in such cases. Rather, the Commissionwill allow an application to be filed and evaluated as to its conformitywith the Commission's filing requirements, but will not take final actionon the application until the additional study is completed.\152\<NOTE/> Of course, if the Commission does not need the results ofthe additional study to take action on the application (<T3>i.e.</T3>, a study described in andSection; 16.8(c)(1)(iii)), it canact on the application without waiting for the study to be completed.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\152\ The provisions of proposed andSection; 16.8(c)(4)(ii)and (iii) are redesignated andSection; 16.8(c)(3)(i) and (ii) by this finalrule. <T3>d. Timing and Procedures.</T3> Montana Power suggests that proposedandSection; 16.8(c)(5) be revised to reflect the fact that potential applicantsconduct studies in addition to studies requested by resource agencies,and that such studies should also be provided to the resource agenciesfor review with the draft application. This change to proposed andSection;16.8(c)(5) (redesignated andSection; 16.8(c)(4) by this final rule) is appropriateand is being made. Washington Wildlife, the Michigan Department, and Montana Natural Resourcessuggest that the 60-day response period for resource agency comments ondraft applications specified in proposed andSection; 16.8(c)(6) be extendedto 90 days, while the Department of Commerce and the EPA suggest that provisionshould be made for extensions in appropriate cases. The Department of Commerce,the Michigan Department, and the EPA also request that the running of theresponse period be measured from the date the   resource agencies receivethe draft applications and related information. The South Carolina Departmentrequests that applicants be required to use certified mail to transmitthe information to the agencies. Finally, PGandamp;E suggests that a provisionbe added specifying that applicants do not have to address in their applicationsany comments submitted by the agencies after the expiration of the 60-dayperiod.Given the complexity of most relicensing proposals, the Commission believesthat it would be appropriate to extend the 60-day response period of proposedandSection; 16.8(c)(6) by an additional 30 days. Accordingly, the Commissionis extending the response period of proposed andSection; 16.8(c)(6) (redesignatedandSection; 16.8(c)(5) by this final rule) from 60 to 90 days. Also, forthe reasons discussed above, the Commission believes it is appropriateto measure the start of the 90-day period from the date of the potentialapplicant's letter transmitting the information to the agencies, and tonot require transmittal by certified mail. Finally, due to the waiver provisionsdiscussed in Part IV.H.5., <T3>infra</T3>, and a potential applicant's ability to appeal a late studyrequest to the Director, the Commission does not believe it is necessaryto make the revisions suggested by PGandamp;E. EEI, PGandamp;E, and Montana Natural Resources suggest that a number of revisionsbe made to the joint meeting provisions of proposed andSection; l6.8(c)(7)pertaining to optional individual consultation and advance written noticeof meetings to resource agencies. As explained in Part IV.H.2.c. and d.,<T3>supra</T3>, revisions addressing these issues are being made to proposedandSection; 16.8(c)(7) (redesignated andSection; 16.8(c)(6) by this final rule).\153\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\153\ Washington Wildlife suggests that proposed andSection;16.8(c)(9) be revised to require potential applicants to describe theirunderstanding of the resource agencies' positions on issues where thereis disagreement and why the applicants do not agree with those positions.This specific requirement is unnecessary, since andSection; 16.8(f) requirespotential applicants to include in their filed applications all correspondencefrom resource agencies, which will explain the basis for the agencies'positions. A few of the commenters suggest that additional procedures be added tothe consultation process prior to the conclusion of the second stage ofagency consultation. Washington Wildlife suggests that applicants be requiredto provide agencies with draft study plans for approval, and to hold annualconsultation meetings with resource agencies to identify progress in completingrequested studies, with study updates provided to the agencies and theCommission every six months. The Michigan Department requests that quarterlystudy reports be provided. Wildlife Federation suggests that some provisionbe made for agency review and comment on study design and methodology.Finally, the Department of Commerce recommends that the section be revisedto require potential applicants to submit detailed study plans to the resourceagencies for approval prior to the applicants' initiation of the studies.The Commission declines to make the suggested revisions regarding additionalprocedures; it is not necessary to establish further procedures to resolvedisputes regarding study minutia.  As many of the commenters point out,the consultation process is intended to be a cooperative, on-going processwhere potential applicants and resource agencies will work together todevelop mutually agreeable studies and study methodologies. Thus, the partiesshould be able to cooperatively resolve disputes regarding implementationof requested studies without the establishment of additional formal procedures.The previously described revisions to andSection; 16.8(b) requiring potentialapplicants to describe their study proposals in their andSection; 16.8(b)(1)information packages, and requiring resource agencies to detail in theirwritten comments following initial joint meetings the reasons behind theirrequests for the use of study methodologies, will help focus and flushout details regarding studies at an early time. Also, disputes regardingmethodologies that arise as a result of agencies' written comments followinginitial joint meetings are disputes arising under the first stage of agencyconsultation, and thus are subject to the dispute resolution process. Consequently,early Commission assistance will be available to resolve any major studydisputes that may arise. The Commission also does not believe it is necessary to establish genericreporting requirements regarding study progress. Each project is differentand the need to touch base with the resource agencies on study progressmay vary from project to project. The need for, and timing of, progressreports are matters potential applicants and resource agencies are expectedto cooperatively resolve among themselves. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Third-Stage Consultation </ITAG>Proposed andSection; 16.8(d) of the NOPR requires an applicant to serve onevery resource agency consulted, and on every agency which is authorizedto assume regulatory supervision over the land, waterways, and facilitiesto be included within a nonpower project, a copy of its application andany deficiency correction, revision, supplement, or amendment to its application.Revisions are being made to the section to clarify that the obligationto serve documents on agencies authorized to assume regulatory supervisionof lands and facilities also applies to applicants for surrender and nonpowerlicense. The section is also being revised to clarify that the obligationto serve documents covers applicants' responses to Commission requestsfor additional information.\154\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\154\ Washington Wildlife suggests that resource agenciesshould be provided with an additional opportunity to review applicationsbefore they are filed, to ensure that the Commission understands the resourceagencies' positions on issues. This requested revision is unnecessary,since agencies have the opportunity to file comments on filed applicationsin response to the public notice issued once an application is acceptedfor Commission processing. <T3>See </T3>andSection; 16.9(d). <ITAG tagnum="81">5. Agency Waiver </ITAG>The NOPR contained a provision regarding resource agency waiver of consultationrequirements. Specifically, proposed andSection; 16.8(e)(1) provided thata potential applicant would not have to comply with a consultation requirementif ``all'' of the appropriate resource agencies waive or are deemed tohave waived compliance with the requirement. Proposed andSection; 16.8(e)(2)specified that a resource agency would be deemed to have waived compliancewith a requirement of this section if it failed either to participate inan initial joint meeting, to identify necessary studies and informationfollowing the joint meeting, or to provide written comments on a draftapplication.Many of the commenters representing developmental interests support theproposed waiver provisions, indicating that resource agencies that failto fulfill their consultation obligations should be excluded from the consultationprocess. These commenters also suggest that the provision should be revisedto clarify that any agency that fails to timely comply with any consultationrequirement should be prohibited from participating in any subsequent stageof the consultation process. The proposed waiver provisions are vigorously opposed by many of the agencyand other commenters.\155\<NOTE/> These commenters state that it would be inappropriate topenalize agencies for failing to timely meet their consultation obligations,since workload demands and other factors may legitimately prevent themfrom attending meetings or providing written comments in a timely manner.They recommend that the waiver provisions either be eliminated or revisedto provide for advance written notice and  other procedures before an agencycan be deemed to have waived consultation. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\155\ <T3>See, e.g.</T3>, the comments of the Departments of Commerce and theInterior, Wildlife Federation and Friends of the Earth. The majority of these commenters have misconstrued the purpose underlyingproposed andSection; 16.8(e). The purpose was not to penalize resource agenciesfailing to timely comply with an obligation imposed on them by excludingthem from further consultation on a project. Rather, the purpose was toenable an applicant to proceed to the next step in the consultation processwithout waiting for an untimely agency to fulfill its obligations undera previous step of the process. The Commission did not intend to implyby this provision that the failure of a resource agency to meet a requirementin a timely fashion would result in its exclusion from further consultationon a project; an untimely agency would be allowed to participate in subsequentconsultation steps. Thus, while an agency could not prevent an applicantfrom holding the initial joint meeting by unreasonably refusing to attendthe meeting, the agency would not be prohibited from submitting writtencomments pursuant to andSection; 16.8(b)(4). The Commission is revising andSection; 16.8(e) to clarify its intent. TheCommission is also clarifying proposed andSection; 16.8(e)(1) to specifythat an applicant does not have to comply with a consultation requirementas to a particular agency if that agency waives compliance with that requirementin writing. Of course, if all relevant resource agencies waive in writingcompliance with a consultation requirement, a potential applicant doesnot have to meet the requirement at all.\156\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\156\ As discussed in Part IV.H.3.d., <T3>supra</T3>, PGandamp;E suggests that applicants not be required to incorporateinto their filed applications late-filed agency comments on their draftapplications. Pursuant to andSection; 16.8(e), an applicant could do thiswithout penalty. However, such applicants should forward to the Commissionany such late-filed comments once they are received, together with anycomments the applicant has in response to them. The Commission acknowledges the possibility of tardy and unresponsive resourceagencies expressed by some of the commenters. However, the Commission doesnot believe it would be consistent with its obligations under the FPA andother statutes to consult with, and consider the views and recommendationsof, various specified agencies if it excluded them from the consultationprocess for relatively insignificant failures to meet consultation deadlines.Furthermore, as discussed previously, studies requested after the conclusionof first-stage agency consultation are subject to the dispute resolutionprocess and do not have to be completed prior to filing an application.Thus, a resource agency that fails to timely comply with a consultationprovision would not be able to interfere with a potential applicant's abilityto file an application in a timely manner. <ITAG tagnum="81">6. Documentation of Agency Consultation. </ITAG>In the NOPR, the Commission proposed (in andSection; 16.8(f)) to requireapplicants to include in the Exhibit E (Environmental  Report) of theirfiled applications, certain specified information documenting their compliancewith the consultation regulations. Included in this provision was a requirementto explain how and why the proposed project would, would not, or shouldnot, comply with relevant comprehensive plans.\157\<NOTE/> In response to suggestions made by EEI and Montana NaturalResources, the Commission is revising this provision to clarify that thecomprehensive plans intended to be covered by this provision are thosereferenced in section 10(a)(2)(A) of the FPA \158\<NOTE/> as defined by Commission regulations.\159\<NOTE/> The Commission is also requiring applicants to indicate whetherany relevant state or Federal resource agency has determined the consistencyof the proposed project with any such plan.\160\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\157\ Proposed andSection; 16.8(f)(6). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\158\ 16 U.S.C. andSection; 803(a)(2)(A) (1982 and Supp. 1988).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\159\ See 18 CFR 2.19 (1988). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\160\ Although the ultimate determination regarding the consistencyof a project with a section 10(a)(2)(A) comprehensive plan will be madeby the Commission, information regarding an agency's determination regardingconsistency will assist the Commission in evaluating this issue. Commissionstaff has reviewed plans filed with the Commission to determine whetherthey are section 10(a)(2)(A) comprehensive plans. Lists of plans foundto be section 10(a)(2)(A) plans are available from the Director. The EPA suggests that andSection; 16.8(f) be revised to require the Commissionto hold a public hearing in any state located upstream or downstream ofa project if the state objects to the project and notifies a Regional EPAAdministrator that the project will  violate the water quality standardsof the upstream or downstream state. Wildlife Federation suggests thatthe section be revised to require potential applicants to include in theirapplications information regarding cumulative environmental impacts.Neither of the suggested revisions is necessary. As to the EPA's recommendation,Section 401(a)(2) of the Clean Water Act already requires the Commissionto hold hearings under certain circumstances in downstream states whosewater quality standards may be violated by a project located in an upstreamstate.\161\<NOTE/> Upstream states may make their views known at any time duringthe application process. The Commission will fully consider all relevantwater quality issues and will hold evidentiary hearings if material issuesof fact are in dispute.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\161\ <T3>See </T3>City of Fort Smith, Arkansas, 44 FERC andpara; 61,160 (1988). With regard to Wildlife Federation's suggestion, as the Commission explainedin <T3>Skykomish River Hydro, Inc.</T3>,\162\<NOTE/> agencies can request during the agency consultation processthe gathering of information related to the project needed to assess cumulativeenvironmental impacts. However, a potential applicant would not be responsiblefor conducting studies to gather data on other projects that may be necessaryto assess cumulative environmental impacts of those projects and the potentialapplicant's project. Also, the Commission itself will examine    cumulativeimpacts during its National Environmental Policy Act process when appropriate. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\162\ 39 FERC andpara; 61,361 (1987); 42 FERC andpara; 61,283(1988); and 43 FERC andpara; 61,123 (1988).    <ITAG tagnum="81">7. Confidentiality of Pre-Filing Submissions </ITAG>The Commission proposed in the NOPR (andSection; 16.8(g)) to permit potentialapplicants to request confidential treatment of any information submittedto the Commission during pre-filing consultation, and to treat any suchrequest in accordance with the confidentiality provisions of the Freedomof Information Act (FOIA) embodied in andSection; 388.112 of the Commission'sregulations.\163\<NOTE/> The Commission also indicated in the preamble to the NOPR\164\<NOTE/> that the proposed confidentiality provision pertained onlyto information released by the Commission, and that other Federal and stateagencies have their own regulations and procedures governing the releaseof information. However, the Commission encouraged resource agencies toconsider the Commission's determination that certain pre-filing consultationinformation is exempt from disclosure in deciding on their treatment ofsuch materials.\165\<NOTE/> A number of commenters suggest elimination or revision ofthis proposed section.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\163\ Draft applications submitted to Commission staff forreview pursuant to 18 CFR 4.32(h) (1988) fall within the scope of thisprovision. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\164\ <T3>See </T3>NOPR preamble at 38. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\165\ <T3>See </T3>NOPR preamble n. 85 at 38.  EEI states that, given the large number of resource agencies that mustbe consulted, the risk of disclosure of confidential    information isgreat. According to EEI, unless additional provisions are added, applicantswill postpone consultation as long as possible to avoid possible disclosureof their plans to potential competitors, which would be contrary to theearly and expeditious consultation envisioned by andSection; 16.8. It thereforesuggests that an additional provision be added to andSection; 16.8(g) thatwould allow potential applicants to request resource agencies to maintainthe confidentiality of information concerning the applicant's plans, supportingstudies, or other materials prepared by or on behalf of the applicant.Under EEI's proposal, if a resource agency declines to maintain the confidentialityof any such information, it would waive the opportunity to consult withthe applicant with respect to such information. EEI also suggests language that would permit resource agencies, in consultingwith competing applicants, to offer comments or opinions based on theirexamination of the confidential information, as long as the plans of theapplicant requesting confidential treatment and the source of the informationwere not revealed. Finally, EEI's proposal would exclude from the confidentialityprovisions, information required to be made available to the public pursuantto andSection; 16.7, and applications and related documents once they arefiled. Alabama Power supports the proposed confidentiality provisions and suggeststhat they continue throughout the entire application preparation process.American Paper and Long Lake, apparently under the impression that theconfidentiality provisions would continue throughout the licensing process,suggest that the confidentiality provisions apply only until the deadlinefor filing final amendments. Georgia Power suggests that the Commissionrequire all state and Federal agencies to keep confidential informationobtained from potential applicants during consultation; it believes thatthe Commission has the authority under the FPA to implement such a requirement.\166\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\166\ Rochester Gas, Southern California Edison and othersgenerally support the confidentiality provisions.  Douglas County PUD and Grant County PUD object to the proposed confidentialityprovisions, noting that municipal applicants would be covered by stateopen-record laws. They contend that it would be inequitable to provideprivate applicants with confidential treatment while municipal applicants'plans would be available through the state open-record laws. The NorthernCalifornia Agency contends that it is contrary to the public disclosureprovisions of the FPA, as added by ECPA, to require entities wishing toobtain confidential information to go through the FOIA process to obtainit. Seattle Light suggests that the Commission revise the provision toprovide guidance regarding the type of information that will be given confidentialtreatment. Montana Natural Resources suggests that the Commission clarifythat state open-record laws are not pre-empted. American Rivers objects to proposed andSection; 16.8(g), contending thatit will interfere with the public's ability to learn about    proposedprojects. It also contends that eliminating the provision will foster competition,since, if competitors are aware of each other's proposals, they will bemore likely to make vigorous efforts to outdo each other. Finally, AmericanRivers requests that the provision be clarified to indicate whether informationis exempt from disclosure merely on the basis of an applicant's request,or only in accordance with the standards for exemption from disclosureestablished by FOIA. American Rivers' comments are supported by Friendsof the Earth. The Department of Commerce indicates that confidential treatmentshould be allowed only as permitted by FOIA.FOIA is a disclosure statute, not a confidentiality statute. Therefore,the Commission proceeds under the presumption that all documents shouldbe open for public review, unless a statutory exemption in FOIA providesotherwise. The purpose of proposed andSection; 16.8(g) was to provide potential applicantswith a mechanism to keep study results and technical information regardingtheir proposals free from wrongful appropriation by potential competitorsin those limited situations where exemption from disclosure is justifiedunder one of the tests of FOIA. However, from the comments received itis clear that the scope of the provision was not adequately explained inthe NOPR. The provisions of andSection; 16.8(g) were not intended to automaticallykeep confidential all information submitted throughout the licensing process.First, we intended that any confidential treatment afforded to submittedmaterial would expire upon the filing of the application to which it pertained.Second, all requests for confidential treatment were to be handled in accordancewith andSection; 388.112 of the Commission's regulations, which, as explainedbelow, does not guarantee confidentiality. Under andSection; 388.112, when a request for confidential treatment is madeCommission staff preliminarily reviews the requester's written justificationfor nondisclosure to determine whether the procedures set out therein havebeen followed and to weed out requests for confidential treatment thatare clearly deficient on their face. Information that passes the preliminaryreview is then placed in a nonpublic file. However, the placing of theinformation in such a file does not mean that the information qualifiesfor exemption from disclosure.\167\<NOTE/> Requests for that information can be made pursuant to FOIA.If a FOIA request is made for such information, the entity requesting theconfidential treatment is provided with an opportunity to respond to therequest, after which the Commission or its designee will determine if theinformation is exempt from disclosure under one of the tests set out inthe FOIA.\168\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\167\ <T3>See </T3>18 CFR 388.112(e) (1988). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\168\ <T3>See </T3>18 CFR 388.112(d) and (e) (1988). <T3>See </T3>5 U.S.C. andSection; 552(b) (1982) for the grounds which justifyan exemption from disclosure. Third, andSection; 16.8(g) would not affect in any way an existing licensee'sobligation under section 15(b)(2) of the FPA to make   certain informationavailable to the public for review and reproduction at the time the existinglicensee files its notice of intent pursuant to section 15(b)(1) of theFPA. Consequently, existing licensees would still have to make availableall of the detailed information required by andSection; 16.7.\169\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\169\ <T3>See </T3>Order No. 496, <T3>supra.</T3> Fourth, and although the NOPR was not clear on this point, andSection; 16.8(g)was not intended to keep potential applicants' general development plansfree from disclosure. As suggested by American Rivers, competitors willbe more likely to make their best efforts to outdo each other if they areaware of each others' general development proposals. Although disclosureof this information may encourage applicants to delay the initiation ofconsultation in some cases, the possibility that an applicant may haveits application rejected or dismissed for its failure to complete consultationas required by andSection; 16.8 prior to filing its application should reducesuch delay to a minimum. As to the withholding of actual development proposalsuntil the final amendment point, the Commission does not believe that itwill be feasible for applicants to substantially revise their proposalsand conduct necessary studies related thereto during the limited finalamendment periods. Thus, withholding of actual proposals until the finalamendment point is unlikely.  Finally, any confidential treatment afforded to study results and otherdetailed information by this proposal will expire upon the filing of therelated application. Consequently, the public will have full opportunityto review and comment on all of the information supporting each developmentproposal. (The public will already have available to it the informationrequired to be disclosed pursuant to Order No. 496, III FERC Stats. andamp;Regs. andpara; 30,812 (Apr. 28, 1988).) The Commission continues to believe that andSection; 16.8(g), as describedherein, is an appropriate and necessary provision. Accordingly, the Commissionis retaining andSection; 16.8(g) as proposed, with a revision to clarifythat any confidential treatment afforded to information under the provisionexpires upon the filing of the related application. The Commission is alsorevising andSection; 16.8(g) to specify that the andSection; 16.8(b)(1) informationpackages will not be subject to the provisions of subsection (g). Thisis consistent with the original intent of andSection; 16.8(g) that generaldevelopment plans were not to be kept confidential, and is necessary inlight of the fact that, as discussed in Part IV.H.8, <T3>infra</T3>, potential applicants will be required to make their andSection;16.8(b)(1) information packages available to the public for inspectionand reproduction prior to conducting the andSection; 16.8(b)(2) joint meetingwith resource agencies and the public. The Commission rejects the suggestions of some of the commenters to extendthe confidentiality coverage through the final amendment period or evenlater, because this would interfere with the public's ability to meaningfullyreview and comment on filed applications. While the Commission is cognizantof the potential inequities advanced by Douglas County PUD and Grant CountyPUD, it does not believe that these inequities override the competitivebenefits discussed above. The Commission also declines to articulate the specific types of informationthat will be protected from disclosure, as suggested by some of the commenters.The Commission believes that decisions regarding the disclosure or non-disclosureof information are best made on a case-by-case basis in accordance withthe tests governing privilege set out in the FOIA, as interpreted by thecourts. Generally, however, the Commission anticipates that most requestsfor confidential treatment will be trade secrets and commercial or financialinformation which is privileged and confidential pursuant to 5 U.S.C. andSection;552(b)(4) (1982). The Commission also does not believe it would be appropriate to hold thata resource agency that refuses a request for confidential treatment ofinformation has waived consultation as to that information, as suggestedby EEI. This may lead to more instances of agency disclosure of informationan applicant wants held confidential. Nevertheless, the Commission doesnot believe that resource agencies' rights to consult pursuant to variousprovisions of the FPA and other statutes can be abrogated by their unwillingnessor inability to accord confidential treatment. Also, as to state agencies,the Commission does not believe that it would be appropriate to interferewith state open-record laws.\170\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\170\ Of course, as it did in the NOPR, the Commission encouragesboth Federal and state resource agencies to consider the Commission's determinationregarding disclosure in individual cases of study results and other detailedinformation in determining how they will handle the same materials. <ITAG tagnum="81">8. Public Participation in Pre-filing Consultation </ITAG>Several of the commenters suggest that andSection; 16.8 should be revisedto provide for public involvement in the consultation process, arguingthat the public has no opportunity to participate effectively in the pre-filingconsultation process and that this exclusion seriously and unfairly disadvantagesthe public. They contend that pre-filing consultation has become increasinglyimportant in recent years, evolving from a vehicle for identifying andresolving information requirements into a vehicle for resolving substantiveissues outside the formal licensing process, and that the proposed regulationsplace even more weight on the consultation process to resolve substantiveissues. They also maintain that pre-filing consultation is even more significantin relicensing proceedings than in original licensing proceedings, sincethe heart of relicensing is the development of appropriate mitigation andenhancement measures. Finally, they argue that resource agencies involvedin the consultation process cannot adequately represent all aspects ofthe public interest.  American Rivers suggests that andSection; 16.8 be revised to permit any personor group to become a formal intervenor in the proceeding after the existinglicensee's notice of intent is filed and publicly noticed under andSection;16.6(d), and that those intervenors be included in the entire consultationprocess and be vested with rights identical to those of the resource agencies.Trout Unlimited, which raises concerns paralleling those of American Riverson the issues of public participation, suggests that the newspaper noticeissued after the filing of the notice of intent indicate that any privatecitizen or organization can become involved in the consultation process.It suggests that public participants either be granted status equal tothat of an agency or that they be notified of meetings and be given summariesof meetings and copies of information provided during the consultationprocess. Washington Ecology urges modification of the section to permitintervention at the earliest possible time and suggests allowing interventionat the notice of intent stage. It also suggests that notice be given inthe <T4>Federal Register </T4>and that entities be provided with 45 days inwhich to file motions to intervene. Wildlife Federation also urges the Commission to allow public intervenorsopportunities for formal and informal participation in pre-filing consultation.In Wildlife Federation's view, a formal proceeding has begun as soon asa notice of intent is filed under andSection; 16.6, and an interested publicparty must be allowed either to intervene formally in those proceedings,or to comment informally, and to participate in meetings and have accessto project sites. Wildlife Federation also suggests that if there is concernabout breaches of confidentiality during the consultation process, theCommission could encourage the signing of an appropriate confidentialityagreement by a public participant. In the alternative, Wildlife Federationsuggests that the Commission could discourage espionage by competitorsby providing that applicants that obtain confidential information aboutanother applicant from intervenors would be subject to denial of theirlicense applications. Seattle Light also recommends that the Commission specify in its regulationshow intervenors may participate in the consultation process, arguing thatearly participation by interested parties during the consultation processwould help reduce unnecessary adverserial confrontation and litigationat the time of relicensing. Finally, Friends of the Earth supports therecommendations of American Rivers and suggests that public intervenorsin the consultation process be allowed to have access to existing projectsites if necessary for responsible and informed involvement in the proceeding.A number of the other commenters, in their reply comments, object to theproposals to require public participation in the andSection; 16.8 consultationprocess. Alabama Power states that it is the responsibility of the resourceagencies to determine the extent of the public's concerns and to voicethose concerns in the consultation process. Furthermore, suggests AlabamaPower, including private organizations with narrow, parochial concernsin the consultation process risks meetings too large and unwieldy to control,numerous unjustified study requests, and an insurmountable number of disagreementsreferred to the Director under the dispute resolution process. EEI contends that public participation in the consultation process wouldbe unnecessary, unreasonable, and possibly unworkable. EEI points out thatprojects evolve during the consultation process and that persons with aperceived interest when the section 15(b)(1) notice is given may have nointerest in the project by the time the application is put in final formand filed. Also, EEI contends that allowing private parties to secure intervenorstatus during consultation could chill communications between the Commissionand applicants, agencies, and the potential intervenors themselves as aresult of the Commission's <T3>ex parte</T3> regulations,\171\<NOTE/> which would become applicable once a formal proceeding wasestablished. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\171\ <T3>See </T3>18 CFR 385.2201 <T3>et seq.</T3> (1988). EEI also contends that allowing the public to intervene in the consultationprocess would destroy the ability of applicants to keep their plans confidential,and that the confidentiality protection measures suggested by WildlifeFederation would be unenforceable. EEI states that interested groups andindividuals already have a mechanism for participating in the process,since they can review the information made available by existing   licenseespursuant to andSection; 16.7 and, based on that review, communicate any concernthey have to the appropriate resource agency, which in turn can then decideif and how those concerns should be addressed during the consultation process.EEI points out that public participation in the consultation process isnot required in either original licensing or amendment proceedings. Finally,EEI points out that the proposals for public participation seem to relateonly to existing licensees, as a result of their filing of notices of intent,and that potential competitors, since they are not required to file noticesof intent, would not be subject to public participation. Idaho Power contends that allowing private parties to participate in theconsultation process would be destructive, since they have no statutoryauthority or responsibility, are answerable to no one, and have varyingdegrees of ability and expertise. Idaho Power suggests that private groupsshould make their concerns known to the entities created by law to overseethe various relevant resources: the state and Federal resource agencies.\172\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\172\ Georgia Power, Public Pool, Rochester Gas, and WisconsinPublic Service express similar concern. The Commission recognizes that some relevant resource issues may not becomeapparent until raised in response to the public notice issued when theapplication is filed and accepted.Consequently, allowing the public to participate in consultation wouldbe beneficial to the extent that relevant issues are identified earlierin the process. We also recognize that local residents and other interested persons havea strong and legitimate interest in knowing the status of a hydroelectricproject in their vicinity. Such persons might well be affected by proposedexpansions or improvements. Riparian property owners might be affectedby contemplated alterations in reservoir and flow levels. Local residentsmay have knowledge about environmental problems associated with the past,present or projected future operations of the project, and may have excellentsuggestions for ameliorating such problems or potential problems. Finally,even if local residents do not have specific questions, complaints or suggestions,at the very least they clearly have an interest in knowing what is goingon in their neighborhood. It is important that potential applicants activelyseek out the views of local residents and other interested persons, affordthem an opportunity to express those views, and provide meaningful informationon the relicensing process. Accordingly, and in order to have potential applicants obtain the viewsof the public regarding significant resource issues that should be addressedin any application for new license that may be filed, the Commission isadding a new andSection; 16.8(b)(3) to specify that members of the publicmay attend and participate in the andSection; 16.8(b)(2) joint meeting withresource agencies. The Commission is also adding a new andSection; 16.8(i)which requires potential applicants to publish notice of the joint meetingat least 14 days in advance in a local daily or weekly newspaper.\173\<NOTE/> In order to aid the public in its understanding of the proposedproject, this new provision also requires potential applicants to makethe andSection; 16.8(b)(1) information package available to the public forinspection and reproduction from the date of the notice to the date ofthe joint meeting.\174\<NOTE/> Finally, new andSection; 16.8(i) specifies\175\<NOTE/> that the form and manner in which this information is tobe made available for public inspection and reproduction is to be governedby the provisions of redesignated andSection; 16.7(e), as promulgated byOrder No. 496, <T3>supra.</T3><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\173\ <T3>See </T3>new andSection; 16.8(i)(1). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\174\ <T3>See </T3>new andSection; 16.8(i)(2)(i). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\175\ <T3>See </T3>new andSection; 16.8(i)(2)(ii). New andSection; 16.8(i)(2)(iii)requires potential applicants to make the andSection; 16.8(b)(1) informationpackage available for inspection by the public at the joint meeting. The Commission recognizes that state and federal resource agencies havetheir own practices and procedures, which may be based on their own underlyingstatutory authority. The public participation provisions adopted hereinare not intended to conflict or be inconsistent with these other statutoryand regulatory provisions. The Commission intends for resource agenciesto attend the andSection; 16.8(b)(2) joint meetings, and encourages themto participate in those meetings to the full   extent that such participationwould not be inconsistent with the resource agencies' own practices andprocedures, and their statutory and regulatory responsibilities. We also note that the failure of a resource agency to request the preparationof a certain study does not mean that the study will not be done. Applicantsare required by the Commission's regulations governing the content of applications\176\<NOTE/> to consider and address all relevant resource issues in theirapplications. The failure of an agency to request a study regarding a resourcewill not excuse an applicant from addressing that resource issue, eitherin its application or in response to a Commission deficiency or additionalinformation letter. Thus, potential applicants will be consulting withvarious interest groups informally in order to adequately address resourceissues of interest to these groups, and the public is encouraged to bringany issues not fully covered to the attention of the Commission.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\176\ <T3>See </T3>18 CFR 4.41, 4.51, and 4.61 (1988). These provisions are applicableto applications for new license. <T3>See </T3>andSection; 16.9(b)(2). To make the Commission aware of the issues once an application has beenfiled, private entities are encouraged to forward to the Commission anywritten correspondence between them and potential applicants and resourceagencies.\177\<NOTE/> After filing   of the license application, private entities,to the extent they believe their concerns have not been addressed, shouldfile comments or interventions with the Commission articulating their positionand explaining why they believe additional studies should be performedor additional issues addressed.\178\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\177\ New andSection; 16.8(f)(2) requires applicants to includein their applications any letters from the public containing comments andrecommendations.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\178\ The Commission recognizes that in some cases potentialapplicants and resource agencies may refuse to consider private entities'suggestions regarding studies. However, the Commission believes that therelicensing scheme established by ECPA provides both potential applicantsand resource agencies with incentives to adequately address the concernsof private entities during consultation. Therefore, the situations wherethe concerns of private entities are ignored should be minimal. Finally, and contrary to the contentions of American Rivers and other commenters,relicensing proceedings are no different from original licensing proceedingsin terms of Commission consideration of agreements between applicants andresource agencies regarding environmental protection, mitigation, and enhancementmeasures. In each case, the Commission will review any agreed-upon measuresand independently determine, pursuant to the requirements of the FPA, whethersuch measures are appropriate and in the public interest. The Commissionmay decline to incorporate the measures into a license if it concludesthat they are not appropriate, and may adopt different measures in lieuthereof. <ITAG tagnum="81">9. Indian Tribes </ITAG>In the NOPR, the Commission requested comments on the most appropriatemechanism to ensure that the concerns and   recommendations of Indian tribesare fully considered by the Commission in relicensing proceedings.\179\<NOTE/> The Commission specifically noted that section 10(a)(2)(B)of the FPA\180\<NOTE/> requires the Commission to consider the recommendations,including fish and wildlife recommendations, of, <T3>inter alia</T3>, Indian tribes affected by the project. Also, section10(a)(3) of the FPA\181\<NOTE/> requires the Commission to solicit recommendations from,<T3>inter alia</T3>, those Indian tribes for proposed terms and conditionsto be considered by the Commission for inclusion in the license. The Commissionalso noted in the NOPR that the legislative history of ECPA raises thequestion of whether Indian tribes should be permitted to participate inthe FPA section 10(j) process to resolve disputes between fish and wildlifeagencies, license applicants, and the Commission.\182\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\179\ <T3>See </T3>NOPR preamble at 18. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\180\ 16 U.S.C. 803(a)(2)(B) (1982 and Supp. 1988). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\181\ 16 U.S.C. 803(a)(3) (1982 and Supp. 1988). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\182\ <T3>See </T3>NOPR preamble at 18. Two commenters suggest that a separate rulemaking proceeding should beinitiated \183\<NOTE/> to consider the involvement of Indian tribes, either becauseit is not germane to relicensing or because the issue should be discussedwith the tribes and the Interior Department before the Commission issuesa proposal.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\183\ Treaty Council and Tacoma Utilities.The Columbia Commission interprets the legislative history of ECPA as expressingan intent to ``grant the tribes a seat at the decisionmaking table''; ``giventhe clear statutory language creating an affirmative obligation for theCommission regarding the involvement of Indian tribes,'' the Columbia Commissionexpresses concern about the absence of regulatory provisions respectingtribal interests.\184\<NOTE/> It suggests that affected Indian tribes be given a role inthe consultation process similar to those of resource agencies; that noticesof meetings, copies of information, and correspondence be transmitted tothose tribes; and that draft documents such as license conditions and orderson studies be circulated for comment by those tribes.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\184\ Columbia Commission at 2. The Great Lakes Commission also suggests that Indian tribes be includedin the consultation process and that tribes be considered as resource agenciesfor all consultation purposes. The Great Lakes Commission recommends thatthe Commission provide funds or otherwise seek funds on behalf of Indiantribes, in order to permit tribes to fully consider and evaluate relicenseapplications. The Wisconsin Department states that the Commission, as part of the Federalgovernment, has a trust responsibility for Indian tribes and that licenseesshould be required to consult with tribes as well as state agencies. Itsuggests that state agencies and tribes prepare memoranda of understandingto set out procedures for jointly determining which studies should be conductedand how mitigation recommendations will be developed. Several commenters state that existing law provides the tribes with appropriatemechanisms to bring their concerns and recommendations before the Commission,but that if tribes are permitted to participate in the consultation processthey should conform to the requirements placed on resource agencies.\185\<NOTE/> The Michigan Department recommends treating tribes as anyother intervening party and not as intermediaries between agencies andapplicants. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\185\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>the comments of Douglas County PUD and Grant CountyPUD.Idaho Power states that it is clear from the statute that Indian tribeswere not meant to be included in the FPA section 10(j) process. It notesthat, although ECPA specifically addressed the interests of Indian tribesin sections 10(a)(2)(B) and 10(a)(3) and contemplates their participationto the degree they feel their interest requires, it did not make Indiantribes into agencies for purposes of the formal consultation process. AmericanPaper states that the legislative history of ECPA does not support automaticinclusion of Indian tribes in the section 10(j) process, since that wouldbe a modification of the Commission's existing obligations. American Papersuggests that interested tribes be permitted to participate in a specificmediation on a case-by-case basis, and that the standards for such tribalparticipation include the direct effect the project will have on that tribe'sreservation and whether participating fish and wildlife agencies are expectedto adequately represent the concerns of the tribe. Tacoma Utilities also opposes an across-the-board standard for the participationof Indian tribes, because a number of circumstances must be consideredin order to determine how to treat tribes in each specific case. The EPAsuggests that comments be solicited by mail from each potentially affectedtribe, and from national and regional intertribal organizations where appropriate.Finally, the Department of Commerce suggests that Indian tribes be a partof the consultation process. As mentioned previously,\186\<NOTE/> the Commission will be preparing a NOPR to develop formalprocedures for implementing the provisions of section l0(j) of the FPA.Inasmuch as the role Indian tribes will play in the section 10(j) processwill be addressed in that rulemaking proceeding, the Commission will deferconsideration of the above referenced arguments to that proceeding, inorder to avoid prejudging the issues to be considered therein. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\186\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>Part IV.C., <T3>supra.</T3>As to the Commission's obligations with regard to Indian tribes under sections10(a)(2)(B) and 10(a)(3) of the FPA, the Commission believes it is requiredto ensure that Indian tribes are directly notified of existing licensees'intentions regarding their projects and other procedural milestones inrelicensing proceedings. It was for that reason that andSection; 16.15(d)(3)(redesignated andSection; 16.6(d)(3) by this final rule) specifies that theCommission will notify appropriate Indian tribes by mail of notices ofintent filed by existing licensees pursuant to section 15(b)(1) of theFPA. Consistent with this, the Commission is: (1) Revising andSection; 16.4to specify that Indian tribes will be mailed copies of requests for acceleration;(2) revising andSection; 16.9(d)(1)(iii) to specify that Indian tribes willreceive direct notice of the acceptance of relicense applications by theCommission; (3) revising andSection; 16.9(d)(2)(ii) to specify that Indiantribes will be mailed copies of the procedural notice required to be issuedby section 15(c)(1) of the FPA; and (4) revising andSection; 16.10(a) torequire applicants to provide the names and mailing addresses of Indiantribes with land on which any part of the proposed project would be locatedor which the applicant reasonably believes would otherwise be affectedby the proposed project. The Commission does not believe, however, that potential applicants shouldbe required to consult with Indian tribes as part of the formal consultationprocedures established by andSection; 16.8. First, the amendments made byECPA to the FPA clearly require the Commission to solicit and considerthe views and recommendations of Indian tribes during the Commission'sprocessing of filed applications. But nothing in ECPA or its legislativehistory indicates that Indian tribes were required to be made a part ofthe consultation process that occurs between potential applicants and resourceagencies before applications are filed. Second, Indian tribes will have available to them the same opportunitiesfor making their concerns and views known to potential applicants, resourceagencies, and the Commission as do other private entities. Also, and asdiscussed previously in relation to general public participation in formalconsultation, applicants are required to allow the public to review theandSection; 16.8(b)(1) information packages and to attend the andSection; 16.8(b)(2)joint consultation meetings with resource agencies. Thus, the potentialapplicants will be informally consulting with Indian tribes to ensure thatresource issues affecting the tribes are considered and addressed.The Indian tribes also will be able to work with the Bureau of Indian Affairsof the Interior Department, which has a direct trust relationship withthe tribes, to ensure that the tribal views and requests for appropriatestudies are communicated to potential applicants during the andSection; 16.8consultation process. Furthermore, in cases where project facilities areor will be located on Indian reservations as defined in the FPA,\187\<NOTE/> the Interior Department will be prescribing mandatory termsand conditions it determines are necessary for the adequate protectionand utilization of the reservation pursuant to section  4(e) of the FPA.\188\<NOTE/> Thus, the Interior Department will be requesting during theandSection; 16.8 consultation process the studies it deems necessary to formulatethese provisions.\189\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\187\ <T3>See</T3> section 3(2) of the FPA, 16 U.S.C. 796(2) (1982). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\188\ <T3>See </T3>City of Pasadena Water and Power Department, 46 FERC andpara;61,004 (1989), where the Commission held that the mandatory conditioningauthority of section 4(e) of the FPA applies to relicensing proceedings.The time deadlines and other parameters on the prescription of section4(e) conditions will be addressed in the rulemaking proceeding regardingsection 10(j) of the FPA. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\189\ As discussed previously (<T3>see</T3> Part IV. H.2.e.,<T3> supra</T3>), the reasonableness and necessity of studies related tomandatory conditioning authority requested of applicants by resource agenciesare proper subjects for dispute resolution. Finally, the Commission does not believe that it should provide or arrangefor funding to assist Indian tribes in their review of applications. Section10(e) of the FPA requires the Commission to collect from all licenseesreasonable annual charges for the purpose of reimbursing the United Statesfor the costs of administering Part I of the FPA, and, from licensees usingtribal lands, reasonable annual charges for use of those lands. Congresshas specifically addressed in section 10(e) the conditions and circumstancesupon which licensees are to provide funding to be used on behalf on Indiantribes. Therefore, the Commission does not believe it would be consistentwith legislative intent to read into section 10(e) an obligation on thepart of licensees to fund Indian review of their applications  for newlicense as part of their obligation to pay annual fees for the administrationof Part I of the FPA. \190\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\190\ Columbia Commission suggests that andSection; 16.8(a)(2)be revised to specify that the Director will provide lists of affectedIndian tribes upon request. However, since the Director will not know theexact configuration of potential projects at this point in time, he wouldnot be able to determine which Indian tribes would be affected by any particularproject. In any event, existing licensees are required to identify affectedIndian tribes in their section 15(b)(1) notices. <T3>See</T3> andSection; 16.7(b)(l0). Also, all applicants must identifyaffected Indian tribes in their applications. <T3>See</T3> andSection; 16.10(a)(12). <ITAG tagnum="81">10. Miscellaneous </ITAG><T3>a. Automatic Intervention. </T3>The Department of Commerce and WashingtonFisheries request that the regulations be revised to provide for automaticintervention in a relicensing proceeding for every agency participatingin consultation under andSection; 16.8 for that project. The Commission rejectsthis suggestion, since it believes that agencies wanting to participateas formal parties to a relicensing proceeding should be required to demonstratetheir level of interest in the proceeding through a motion to intervene.However, as indicated in a recent policy statement, late interventionsby fish and wildlife agencies will be permitted in the context of section10(j) proceedings, at least on a temporary basis pending considerationof these and related issues in the rulemaking proceeding on the proceduralimplementation of section 10(j).\191\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\191\ <T3>See</T3> Order No. 511, <T3>supra.</T3><T3>b. Transition Provisions.</T3> The Commission is adding a transitionprovision (new andSection; 16.8(j)) specifying which provisions of andSection;16.8 have to be complied with by applicants that have initiated or completedagency consultation pursuant to andSection; 4.38 of the Commission's regulations.This provision is in response to concern expressed by a number of the commenters\192\<NOTE/> regarding the applicability of the consultation provisionsof andSection; 16.8 to projects where the applicants either have completedconsultation pursuant to andSection; 4.38 of the Commission's regulationsand filed their applications, or have already initiated consultation ontheir projects pursuant to andSection; 4.38. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\192\ <T3>See, e.g.</T3>, the comments of EEI, Montana Power, Niagara Mohawk,and Nebraska Power. Specifically, andSection; 16.8(j) exempts from andSection; 16.8 applicationsfiled before the effective date of this rule.\193\<NOTE/> In addition, the transition provision specifies that applicantsdo not have to comply with certain steps of andSection; 16.8 if they havealready complied with the comparable provisions under andSection; 4.38.\194\<NOTE/> Also, the provision requires all potential applicants thathave already complied with stage-one consultation under andSection; 4.38to hold a public meeting to solicit the views of the public regarding significantresource issues that should be addressed in any application for new licensethat may be filed.\195\<NOTE/> The   provisions regarding advance public notice of the meetingand availability of certain information are comparable to those specifiedin andSection; 16.8(i). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\193\ Section 16.8(j)(1). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\194\ Section 16.8(j)(2) and (3). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\195\ Section andSection; 16.8(j)(4). The new provision requires all requests for waiver of, or clarificationregarding, the application of the transition provisions to a particularproceeding to be submitted to the Director within 90 days from the effectivedate of this final rule.\196\<NOTE/> This will expeditiously clear up any questions regardingwhich aspects of andSection; 16.8 must be complied with by a potential applicantthat has already initiated consultation with resource agencies under andSection;4.38. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\196\ Section 16.8(j)(5). <T3>c. Clarification of Commission's Obligations.</T3> A few of the commenters,including Washington Wildlife and the Department of Commerce, suggest thatthe regulations specify how the Commission itself will consult with resourceagencies and Indian tribes. To the extent these requests relate to proceduresunder section 10(j) of the FPA, the requests will be addressed in the contextof the rulemaking that is being developed regarding that section. Generally,however, the Commission will continue its practice of seeking the viewsof resource agencies through: (1) The documentation of agency consultationcontained in filed applications; (2) the notices of application acceptancesmailed directly to resource agencies and Indian tribes by the Commission;and (3) the requirement that applicants, in   responding to Commissiondeficiency and additional information letters, seek and obtain the viewsand recommendations of relevant resource agencies in appropriate cases.I. Notices of Intent From Competitors Section 15(b)(1) of the FPA requires existing licensees, at least fiveyears prior to the expiration of their licenses, to file notices of intentregarding whether they intend to file applications for new license. Section16.6 of the regulations contains provisions regarding the filing of thesenotices of intent by existing licensees. A number of commenters suggest that the Commission also require potentialcompetitors to file notices of intent. According to Idaho Power, the goalof encouraging competition would be advanced if the existing licensee wereto learn of the existence of a competing applicant as soon as that applicantinitiates consultation with resource agencies. In Idaho Power's words,``[t]his would tend to sharpen the applicant's approach to the projectand ensure that the applicant is not `blind-sided' by an application filedat the last minute by a competitor.'' \197\<NOTE/> EEI suggests that notices of intent from competitors be filedno later than four and one-half years prior to the expiration of the relevantlicense. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\197\ Idaho Power at 4. Similar requests for the Commissionto require competitors to file notices of intent are made by Niagara Mohawk,Seattle Light, EEI, Alabama Power, and others.As pointed out by the Northern California Agency in its reply comments,in Order No. 496, which promulgated andSection; 16.6, the Commission consideredand rejected the suggestion that potential competitors be required to filenotices of intent. As the Commission explained therein, imposition of sucha requirement would be inconsistent with the relicensing scheme establishedby ECPA and could be anticompetitive.\198\<NOTE/> Also, and as clearly illustrated by Idaho Power's comments,requiring such notices of intent from competitors might discourage existinglicensees from using their best efforts in developing applications fornew license in some cases. This is because existing licensees, not seeingnotices of intent from potential competitors, will assume there is no competitionand will not have an incentive to ``sharpen'' their applications. Sincethe commenters have not advanced any arguments the Commission has not alreadyconsidered, the Commission once again rejects the suggestion that all competitorsbe required to submit notices of intent.\199\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\198\ <T3>See </T3>III FERC Stats. andamp; Regs. andpara; 30,812 at 31,106-107. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\199\ Seattle Light contends that notices of intent from allcompetitors are necessary in order to coordinate the consultation and applicationprocess of the competitors. According to Seattle Light, without such coordinationcompeting applicants will be requested by resource agencies to performidentical studies at different times, and resource agencies will be ableto use studies prepared by an applicant that initiates consultation firstin formulating study demands on an applicant initiating consultation ata later date. In order to avoid these potential inequities, Seattle Lightrequests that the Commission: require all applicants to file notices ofintent; establish identical deadlines for completing each step of the consultationprocess for each applicant; and require resource agencies to request identicalenvironmental studies of each competitor during all stages of the consultationprocess. <ITAG tagnum="28">As noted above, requiring notices of intent from all  competitorswould not be consistent with ECPA. Also, while requiring competitors tocomplete each step of the consultation process at the same time could reducethe potential for disparate treatment of competitors by agencies, the Commissiondoes not believe this requirement would be appropriate since applicantswho do not presently hold licenses probably will be unable to initiateconsultation as soon as existing licensees due to their need to reviewand analyze the information made available by existing licensees pursuantto section 15(b)(2) of the FPA. Finally, and while the Commission encouragesresource agencies to be consistent in their requests to competing applicantsfor studies, the Commission does not believe that identical studies canbe mandated, because of differences between competing proposals and thecontinuing development of appropriate methodologies over time.</ITAG>J.Filing and Processing of Applications In the NOPR, the Commission proposed that applications for new licensecould be filed at least 24 months, but not more than 30 months, beforethe existing license expires.\200\<NOTE/> The NOPR also specified that applications would have to meetthe requirements of andSection; 4.32 of the Commission's regulations,\201\<NOTE/> but that an applicant would have until 18 months before theexpiration of the existing license in which to correct deficiencies inits application.\202\<NOTE/> Also, the NOPR specified that an application would have tomeet the pertinent requirements of the Commission's regulations governingthe content of applications.\203\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\200\ Proposed andSection; 16.9(b)(1). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\201\ Section 4.32 of the Commission's regulations containsthe general procedures regarding the filing and processing of applications.Among other things, andSection; 4.32 specifies that the Director: (1) Willprovide applicants with 90 days in which to correct deficiencies in theirapplications and will reject any application when the deficiencies arenot timely corrected (andSection; 4.32(e)(1)); (2) will reject within 60days any application that patently fails to substantially comply with theregulations governing content of applications and resource agency consultation(andSection; 4.32(e)(2)); and (3) will provide applicants with appropriatetime to provide additional information needed to evaluate their projectsand may dismiss an application, hold it in abeyance, or take other appropriateaction if the information is not provided in a timely manner (andSection;4.32(g)).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\202\ Proposed andSection; 16.9(b)(3). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\203\ <T3>Id. </T3>Those regulations are embodied in 18 CFR 4.41, 4.51, and 4.61(1988).

The NOPR specified that the Director would review all applications andwould notify all applicants of any deficiencies in their applications within90 days of their filing.\207\<NOTE/> In addition, the NOPR specified that all amendments to anapplication, including correction of any deficiency and the final amendment,must be filed with the Commission no later than 18 months before the expirationof the existing license.\208\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\207\ Proposed andSection; 16.9(c)(1).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\208\ Proposed andSection; 16.9(c)(2).

The notice would indicateany processing deadlines already established under andSection; 4.32, theestimated dates for further processing deadlines under andSection; 4.32,and the final amendment deadline for the project as established in proposedandSection; 16.9(c)(2) (<T3>i.e.</T3>, 18 months prior to the expiration of the existing license).This notice would be published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, be provided to appropriate state and Federalresource agencies, and be served on all parties.\210\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\209\ Proposed andSection; 16.9(d)(1). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\210\ Proposed andSection; 16.9(d)(2).As discussed in the NOPR,\211\<NOTE/> the purpose of the prohibition on the filing of applicationsprior to 30 months before the expiration of an existing license was toavoid the filing of competing applications several years apart, and thenon-contemporaneous review of data entailed in the filing of such applications.Also, by limiting the time period in which applications could be filedto a six-month period prior to the new application filing deadline, theCommission would ensure that all applications would include the most up-to-dateenvironmental, economic, and other information. The other processing deadlinesin proposed andSection; 16.9, including the establishment in andSection; 16.9(c)(2)of a generic final amendment deadline for all proceedings, were intendedto promote the expeditious processing of applications for new license,and to avoid confusion regarding processing deadlines by establishing thesame date for filing final amendments and correcting deficiencies.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\211\ <T3>See </T3>NOPR preamble at 3-4. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Filing Window </ITAG>Many of the commenters, while supporting the Commission's goal of contemporaneousreview of applications for new license, do not believe the six-month filingwindow and other procedures proposed in andSection; 16.9 are realistic. Withregard to the filing window, Great Northern, Rochester Gas, and others,pointing to the large number of applications for new license that willbe  filed in the next few years,\212\<NOTE/> indicate that requiring all applications to be filed withinthis window of time will create tremendous processing burdens for Commissionstaff. The commenters also argue that the information contained in theapplications will be the same regardless of the time they are filed; ifthe Commission determines that more up-to-date information is needed toevaluate an application filed significantly before the 24-month filingdeadline, the Commission can request the applicant to provide the information.Finally, they argue that the Commission should not delay the filing andprocessing of existing licensees' applications for new license on the offchance that competing applications may be filed near the 24-month filingdeadline. They therefore request that the six-month filing window be eliminated.\213\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\212\ Approximately 170 licenses expire between January 1,1990, and December 31, 1993. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\213\ Washington Wildlife suggests that the process couldbe improved by expanding the filing window by between six and twelve months.The Department of Commerce questions whether the 24-to-30-month periodwill provide the Commission sufficient time to process applications. The Commission finds the arguments of the commenters persuasive, and thereforeis revising andSection; 16.9(b)(1) to eliminate the prohibition on the filingof applications before the 30-month point. However, the Commission is stillconcerned with the possibility that it may have to repeat evaluations performedon applications filed years prior to the 24-month filing deadline. Consequently,the Commission will not process an application  until the final amendmentpoint except to the extent of determining whether it conforms to the Commission'sfiling requirements (<T3>i.e., </T3>the processing stage at which an acceptance letter is sent),unless the applicant indicates in its application that it waives the rightto make a final amendment pursuant to section 15(c)(1) of the FPA.\214\<NOTE/> Absent such waiver, further processing will commence onlyafter the expiration of the final amendment deadline.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\1\\4\ If a competing application is eventually filed forthe project, the right of the applicant to file a final amendment willbe automatically reinstated without further order of the Commission. AlthoughGreat Northern correctly indicates that this problem could be eliminatedby requiring all potential competitors to file notices of intent, for thereason discussed in Part IV.I., <T3>supra, </T3>the Commission does not believe it would be consistentwith ECPA to impose this requirement.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Processing Deadlines </ITAG>With regard to the other deadlines, the commenters also contend that, giventhe upcoming relicensing case load, it is unrealistic to assume that theCommission will be able to review all applications and make deficiencydeterminations within 90 days.\215\<NOTE/> Furthermore, the commenters \216\<NOTE/> contend that 90 days provides insufficient time for applicantsto correct any deficiencies that are found and to file final amendments.They also contend that the final amendment deadline should be establishedon a case-by-case basis in order to accommodate the varying degrees ofcomplexity involved in each case.\217\<NOTE/> They therefore request that three provision be removed fromandSection; 16.9: (1) The provision specifying that deficiency determinationsbe made within 90 days; (2) the provision specifying that deficiency correctionsbe made no later than 18 months prior to the expiration of the license;and (3) the provision specifying that the final amendment deadline willbe 18 months prior to the expiration date of the license. In lieu thereof,they request that the final amendment deadline for each particular casebe established in the notice to be issued within 60 days of the 24-monthfiling deadline pursuant to section 15(c)(1) of the FPA, and that applicantsbe allowed to correct deficiencies in their applications until the finalamendment deadline.\218\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\215\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>the comments of American Rivers, Idaho Power, MontanaPower, and Seattle Light. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\216\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>the comments of Alabama Power, EEI, Idaho Power, andMontana Power.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\217\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>the comments of Alabama Power, EEI, Idaho Power, PGandamp;E,Puget Sound Power, Southern California Edison, and Washington Power. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\218\ Seattle Light and New York Electric suggest that theperiod for filing final amendments be extended to 12 months prior to theexpiration date of the license. Friends of the Earth and Rochester Gassuggest that extensions of the final amendment deadline be permitted inappropriate cases. The Commission finds these arguments persuasive. Accordingly, the Commissionis: (1) Revising proposed andSection; 16.9(b)(3) (redesignated andSection;16.9(b)(2) by this final rule \219\<NOTE/>) to eliminate the provision requiring deficiencies to becorrected no later than 18 months prior to the expiration of the license;(2) revising proposed andSection; 16.9(c) to eliminate the statement thatthe Director will make deficiency determinations within 90 days \220\<NOTE/> and to specify that all amendments, including final amendments,must be filed no later than the date specified in the andSection; 16.9(d)(2)notice; and (3) revising andSection; 16.9(d)(2) so that the FPA section 15(c)(1)notice will specify the deadline for filing final amendments in each proceeding.Revisions are also being made to andSection; 16.9(c)(2) to provide for theestablishment in the andSection; 16.9(d)(2) notice of deadlines for the filingof better adapted statements.\221\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\219\ Proposed andSection; 16.9(b)(2), which contained transitionprovisions regarding the prohibition on the filing of applications priorto 30 months, is being deleted. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\220\ The NOPR (<T3>see</T3> preamble at 9) also requested comments on procedures thatwould apply if the Commission did not review an application within the90-day period. Since the 90-day limit is being removed, the comments filedin response to this request have been rendered moot. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\221\ See 18 CFR 4.36(d)(2) (1988). The Commission declines, however, to modify andSection; 16.9(b) to allowall applicants until the final amendment deadline to correct deficienciesin their applications, as suggested by some of the commenters. Althoughthe deadline for correcting deficiencies probably will be set to correspondto the final amendment deadline in most cases, the Commission does notbelieve it would be appropriate to provide for this for all cases. As discussedpreviously, it will now be possible to file applications more than 30 monthsprior to the expiration of existing licenses. In order to process thoseapplications  expeditiously, the Director must be able to set responseperiods for correcting deficiencies that will expire prior to any finalamendment deadlines that may be established. Accordingly, the regulationsleave to the discretion of the Director the determination of the time periodsin which to correct deficiencies.\222\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\222\ 18 CFR 4.32(e)(1) (1988) provides that applicants forlicense shall have up to 90 days in which to correct deficiencies in theirapplications. In order to provide the Director with flexibility in determiningdeficiency response periods, the Commission is revising redesignated andSection;16.9(b)(2) to specify that if appropriate, the Director may provide morethan 90 days in which to correct deficiencies. As suggested by some of the commenters,\223\<NOTE/> the Commission is adding a new paragraph (3) to andSection;16.9(d) to require the Director, in cases where two or more mutually exclusiveapplications for a site are filed, to establish the same final amendmentdeadline for all such applications. This provision also requires the Director,in cases where two or more mutually exclusive applications for a site arefiled, to establish the same deadlines for filing better adapted statements.For the reasons just discussed, the Commission will not require the establishmentof identical deadlines for other processing steps.\224\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\223\ <T3>See, e.g.</T3>, the comments of EEI and PGandamp;E. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\224\ The reference in andSection; 16.9(d)(2) to ``processingdeadlines established under andSection; 4.32'' encompasses such things asthe date by which the Director will determine if an application is deficientand the dates established for the correction of deficiencies and the submittalof additional information.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Forfeiture  </ITAG>As indicated previously, redesignated andSection; 16.9(b)(2) provides thatapplications for license will be processed in accordance with andSection;4.32 of the Commission's regulations, while proposed andSection; 16.9(b)(5)(redesignated andSection; 16.9(b)(4) by this final rule) provides that, ifthe Commission rejects or dismisses an application pursuant to andSection;4.32, the application may not be refiled if the filing deadline for anapplication for a new license has expired. As a result of these two sections,if the Director rejects or dismisses an application filed before the 24-monthfiling deadline because it is patently deficient,\2\\2\\5\<NOTE/> or because the applicant fails to correct deficiencies \2\\2\\6\<NOTE/> or respond to an additional information request \2\\2\\7\<NOTE/> in a timely manner, the applicant cannot refile its applicationif the 24-month filing deadline for the project has passed.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\225\ <T3>See </T3>18 CFR 4.32(e)(2)(i) (1988). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\226\ <T3>See </T3>18 CFR 4.32(e)(1)(iii) (1988). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\227\ <T3>See </T3>18 CFR 4.32(g) (1988). PGandamp;E objects to the operation of these provisions, contending thatthey could result in the forfeiture of an existing licensee's project ``formere pleading discrepancies.'' According to PGandamp;E, the guiding principlebehind ECPA was Congress' intention to protect existing licensees and theircustomers from the risk of project loss for reasons not based on the overallpublic interest. PGandamp;E contends that the operation of  these sectionswould allow the Commission to dismiss for ``pleading problems'' a relicenseapplication ``duly'' filed ``in good faith'' by an existing licensee priorto the only application deadline established by ECPA, and thus would beinconsistent with Congress' intent in enacting ECPA.\228\<NOTE/> It therefore requests that andSection; 16.9(b) be revised tospecify that any application rejected or dismissed pursuant to andSection;4.32 could be refiled if the deficiencies or other problems that led tothe rejection or dismissal are corrected within a reasonable period oftime, as established in the order or letter rejecting or dismissing theapplication. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\228\ PGandamp;E's comments at 4 and 11. PGandamp;E's arguments are not totally unpersuasive. The Commission appreciatesthe concern about potential forfeiture in the event of a mere pleadingdiscrepancy of a technical nature. The Commission also acknowledges thatone of the goals of ECPA was to avoid disruptions to the customers of existinglicensees as a result of license transfers unless there was a good publicinterest reason to do so. However, ECPA and its legislative history clearlyshow that Congress also intended for the Commission to fully and carefullyconsider all developmental and non-developmental values, particularly fishand wildlife, in considering relicense applications, and for state andFederal resource agencies to play a major role in the process. Furthermore,the requirement in FPA section 15(c)(1) for a notice establishing expeditiousrelicensing proceedings indicates Congress' intent that relicensing proceedingsnot be delayed. The Commission believes that the primary way the Commission can ensurethat these goals of ECPA are met is to apply to applications that are rejectedor dismissed, the same andSection; 4.32 processing procedures it uses inall competitive cases when a competition deadline has passed.\229\<NOTE/> The possibility that an applicant will not be able to refileits application if it is rejected will help ensure: (1) That applicantswill include in their applications the environmental and other informationthe Commission needs to fulfill its obligations under the FPA as amendedby ECPA; (2) that applicants adequately consult with state and Federalresource agencies as envisioned by ECPA; and (3) that applicants do notdelay the relicensing proceedings by failing to timely correct deficienciesand respond to additional information requests.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\229\ Under andSection; 4.32(e), if a license application isrefiled after being rejected for being patently deficient or because theapplicant failed to timely respond to a request to correct deficiencies,the date the application is refiled will be considered as the filing dateof the original application. <T3>See </T3>18 CFR 4.32(e)(2)(iii) (1988). However, if this new filingdate is later than the deadline for filing competing development applicationsestablished in the public notice issued for a first-filed application,the amended application will be rejected. <T3>See id. </T3>and 18 CFR 4.36(b) (1988).No forfeiture of existing licensees' projects will occur as a result ofthe operation of these provisions if, in PGandamp;E's  words, existing licenseesfile and pursue their applications ``in good faith'' by filing applicationsthat are not so devoid of the information required by the Commission'sregulations as to be patently deficient, and by fully responding to requeststo correct deficiencies or supply additional information within the timeperiods specified in the deficiency or additional information letters.The other revisions being made to andSection; 16.9 will ensure that the timeperiods for applicants' responses will not be unreasonable. For example,and as indicated previously, andSection; 16.9(b)(2) is being revised to specifythat the Director may provide more than 90 days in which to correct deficienciesin applications. Thus, in appropriate cases, the Director may provide morethan 90 days to correct deficiencies either in his initial deficiency lettersor in response to requests for extensions of time to comply with deficiencycorrection requests. Finally, the Commission also notes that applicantswill have the right to appeal any rejection or dismissal to the Commission,which, if granted, would result in the reinstatement of the applicationwith its original filing date.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Material Amendments </ITAG>As indicated previously, proposed andSection; 16.9(b)(4) (redesignated andSection;16.9(b)(3) by this final rule) provides that the Commission's materialamendment regulation (andSection; 4.35) will not apply to applications filedunder andSection; 16.9, except that the Commission will reissue public noticeof the application pursuant to andSection; 16.9(d)(1). The Department ofCommerce requests an explanation of the provision, stating that it seesno reason why andSection; 4.35 should not apply to relicensing proceedingsin the same manner as it applies to original licensing proceedings. Under andSection; 4.35, when amendments to applications that are consideredas ``material'' \230\<NOTE/> are filed, the filing date of the initial application isdeemed to be the date the material amendment is filed for a variety ofpurposes, including the determination of whether the initial applicationwas timely filed vis-a-vis competition deadlines.\231\<NOTE/> On its face, andSection; 4.35 applies to relicensing proceedings.\232\<NOTE/> However, application of andSection; 4.35 to relicensing proceedingswould mean that an application for new license timely filed by an applicantprior to the 24-month new license filing deadline would be rejected ifthe applicant were to file a material amendment to the application afterthe 24-month deadline, even if the amendment were filed prior to the finalamendment deadline established for the proceeding. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\230\ <T3>See</T3> 18 CFR 4.35(f) (1988). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\231\ <T3>See</T3> 18 CFR 4.35 (a) and (c)(1) (1988). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\232\ <T3>See</T3> Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation and Fourth Branch Associates,46 FERC andpara; 61,159 (1989). The Commission believes it is appropriate to waive andSection; 4.35 as torelicensing proceedings to avoid this situation. The provision in section15(c)(1) for the submittal of final amendments is not specifically limitedto minor amendments. In   addition, the legislative history of ECPA doesnot indicate that Congress intended the final amendment process to be limitedto minor or non-material amendments. Rather, it indicates that the finalamendment provision was intended to allow an applicant to address and resolveany problems or inadequacies in its application,\233\<NOTE/> and to revise its application in any way it felt necessaryto make its application superior to a competitor's.\234\<NOTE/> Thus, the Commission believes it would be appropriate toretain andSection; 16.9(b)(4) (redesignated as andSection; 16.9(b)(3) by thisfinal rule) as proposed in the NOPR, so as to not limit  applicants' abilityto revise their applications during the final amendment period. However,and as proposed in the NOPR, the andSection; 16.9(d)(1) notice will be reissuedto obtain the views of the public and others should an amendment consideredmaterial under andSection; 4.35(f) be filed.\235\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\233\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>H.R.

Miscellaneous </ITAG>The Michigan Department suggests that andSection; 16.9 be revised to clarifywhat consultation procedures will be used by applicants for new and nonpowerlicense. However, this is unnecessary, since andSection; 16.8 specificallyapplies to applicants for ``a new license, a nonpower license, an exemptionfrom licensing, or a surrender of a project.'' A number of commenters \236\<NOTE/> suggest that andSection; 16.9 be revised to state that theCommission will provide copies of Commission deficiency letters to allconsulted resource agencies. Although the Commission's normal practicehas been to specify in deficiency letters that applicants are requiredto provide resource agencies with copies of the deficiency letter whenthe deficiency letter requires consultation with those agencies, the Commissionbelieves it would be appropriate to codify this requirement in the regulations.Accordingly, the Commission is revising andSection; 16.8(d)(2) (which requiresapplicants to serve on consulted agencies, <T3>inter alia</T3>, all responses to Commission deficiency letters andadditional information requests) to require applicants to serve on theagencies the Commission correspondence requesting such information.\237\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\236\ <T3>See e.g., </T3>the comments of the Department of Commerce, the NewYork Department, Washington Fisheries, and Washington Wildlife.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\237\ <T3>See</T3> new andSection; 16.8(d)(2)(iii).Finally, the Department of Commerce requests that the Commission consultwith resource agencies at the time an application is filed regarding whetherthe application is deficient, in cases where the application does not containthe studies or information requested by the agencies during stage-one consultation.Under the Department's proposal, if Commission staff determined that thestudies or data were unnecessary, it would provide the resource agencieswith a detailed written explanation of its determination, which could thenbe appealed to the Commission by the agencies. The Commission declines to adopt the Department of Commerce's suggestions.First, the authority to determine an application's conformity with theCommission's requirements resides with the Commission, not the resourceagencies. Second, since applicants will be required by andSection; 16.8 toinclude in their applications descriptions of any disagreements with resourceagencies and any correspondence from the agencies, the Commission willhave sufficient information to determine whether an applicant has compliedwith the consultation requirements of  andSection; 16.8. Third, and as discussedin Part IV.H.3.C., <T3>supra</T3>, the failure of an applicant to conduct certain necessarystudies prior to filing its application will not be considered a deficiency.Finally, and also as discussed previously,\238\<NOTE/> the Commission does not believe it would be appropriate topreapprove interlocutory appeals to the Commission regarding studies. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\238\ <T3>See</T3> Part IV.H.2.e., <T3>supra.</T3> K. Standards and Factors for Relicensing ECPA amended section 15 of the FPA by adding a new paragraph (a)(2), settingout a number of specific factors the Commission must consider, and, inthe case of competing applications, must compare in evaluating applicationsfor new license. In addition, ECPA added a new paragraph (a)(3) to section15 of the FPA requiring the Commission, in the case of an existing licensee,to also take into consideration the existing licensee's record of compliancewith the terms and conditions of the existing license,\239\<NOTE/> and the actions taken by the existing licensee which affectthe public.\240\<NOTE/> Finally, Congress specified that a new license shall be issuedto the applicant that has the final proposal determined by the Commissionto be best adapted to serve the public interest. Insignificant differencesbetween competing applications with regard to the specific factors setout above  are not to be determinative or result in the transfer of a project.\241\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\239\ Section 15(a)(3)(A) of the FPA, 16 U.S.C. 808(a)(3)(A)(1982 and Supp. 1988). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\240\ Section 15(a)(3)(B) of the FPA, 16 U.S.C. 808(a)(3)(B)(1982 and Supp. 1988). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\241\ Section 15(a)(2) of the FPA, 16 U.S.C. 808(a)(2) (1982and Supp. 1988).

Paragraph (a) of the section \242\<NOTE/> was intended to cover the factors set out in section 15(a)(2)(A)-(G)of the FPA. Paragraph (b) \243\<NOTE/> was intended to cover the factors set out in section 15(a)(3)of the FPA, and to establish the test the Commission would use in choosingbetween the applications of an existing licensee and of a competitor whenthere were only insignificant differences between the competing applications.Specifically, proposed andSection; 16.13(b) provided as follows: <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\242\ Proposed andSection; 16.13(a). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\243\ Proposed andSection; 16.13(b). <ITAG tagnum="21">(b) If there are only insignificant differences between the finalapplications of an existing licensee and a competing applicant after considerationof the factors enumerated in paragraph (a), the Commission will base itsdecision on the existing licensee's record of compliance with the termsand conditions of the existing license.</ITAG>Finally, the Commission discussed in the preamble to the NOPR the typeof items it would examine in evaluating the specific factors of section15(a) (2) and (3), and solicited suggestions on what other factors it mighttake into account.\244\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\244\ <T3>See </T3>NOPR preamble at 19-32.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Consistency With Statute. </ITAG>A number of commenters \245\<NOTE/> contend that the provisions of proposed andSection; 16.13 misstatethe provisions of the statute. They request that andSection; 16.13 be revisedeither to track the statutory language exactly or to state merely thatthe Commission will consider the factors enumerated in section 15(a) (2)and (3) in evaluating applications for new license. These commenters alsocontend that proposed andSection; 16.13(b) and the related discussion inthe preamble\246\<NOTE/> misstate the provisions of section 15(a)(3) by incorrectlymerging into one ``compliance'' factor the requirement of section 15(a)(3)(A)to consider an existing licensee's record of compliance with the termsand conditions of its existing license, and the requirement of section15(a)(3)(B) to consider the existing licensee's actions that affect thepublic. Finally, some commenters\247\<NOTE/> contend that proposed andSection; 16.13(b) would incorrectlylimit the Commission's review of the items specified in section l5(a)(3)to cases where a non-existing licensee applicant is competing with an existinglicensee and there are only insignificant differences between the proposals.They argue that review of the section 15(a)(3) factors must occur in allcases where an existing licensee has filed an application for new   license,and not just in cases where there is competition or only insignificantdifferences between the proposals.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\245\ <T3>See</T3>, <T3>e.g.</T3>, the comments of Alabama Power, EEI, Northern CaliforniaAgency, Niagara Mohawk, PGandamp;E, Southern California Edison, and WashingtonPower. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\246\ <T3>See </T3>NOPR preamble at 20. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\247\ <T3>See</T3>, <T3>e.g.</T3>, the comments of American Rivers, the Northern CaliforniaAgency, and Niagara Mohawk. The Commission agrees that the text of andSection; 16.13(a) as proposed inthe NOPR misstates the provisions of the statute. For example, proposedandSection; 16.13(a)(1), while accurately reflecting the requirements ofsection 15(a)(2)(A)(i) of the FPA, omits the reference of section 15(a)(2)(A)(ii)to the plans and abilities of an applicant to comply with other applicableprovisions of Part I of the FPA.\248\<NOTE/> Accordingly, the Commission is revising andSection; 16.13(a)to state that when the Commission makes its determination regarding whethera proposal is best adapted to serve the public interest, it will considerthe factors enumerated in section 15(a)(2) of the FPA and, as discussednext, the factors enumerated in section 15(a)(3) of the FPA.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\248\ EEI also contends that proposed andSection; 16.13(a) incorrectlyomitted any reference to section 15(a)(2)(G)'s catch-all provision (``suchother factors as the Commission may deem relevant''). However, proposedandSection; 16.13(a)(7) stated that the Commission would consider ``the provisionsof section 10 of the Federal Power Act.'' Since section 10(a)(1) of theFPA requires the Commission to evaluate all relevant public interest considerations(See Udall v. FPC, 387 U.S. 428 (1967)), the reference to section 10 ofthe FPA in andSection; 16.13(a)(7) would have allowed the Commission to considerany factor it deemed relevant to a particular relicensing proceeding. AmericanRivers also objects to the use of the FPA section 10 reference, contendingthat it would not encompass all matters that may be relevant in a relicensingproceeding. However, as just mentioned, section 10(a)(1) of the FPA encompassesany and all relevant public interest considerations.The Commission also agrees that the text of proposed andSection; 16.13(b)should be revised. The purpose of the paragraph was to codify the testthat ECPA and its legislative history\249\<NOTE/> indicate should be used when there are only insignificantdifferences between an application submitted by an existing licensee andan application submitted by another entity: the positive and negative aspectsof the existing licensee's track record as defined in section 15(a)(3)(A) and (B) of the FPA. The language of proposed andSection; 16.13(b) wasnot intended either to merge the section 15(a)(3)(B) and section 15(a)(3)(A)factors or to indicate that the Commission would not consider the existinglicensee's actions related to the project that affect the public, as specifiedby section 15(a)(3)(B). The Commission fully intends to comply with itsobligation to consider both of the factors enumerated in section 15(a)(3)of the FPA.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\249\ <T3>See </T3>132 Cong. Rec. H8950 (Oct. 2, 1986) (colloquy between Rep.Markey and Rep. Moorhead during House floor consideration of the ECPA ConferenceReport).  Proposed andSection; 16.13(b) also was not intended to imply that the Commissionwould not consider an existing licensee's track record pursuant to section15(a)(3) unless there were an applicant competing against an existing licenseeand then only when there were insignificant differences between the proposals.The obligation to consider an existing licensee's track record applieseven if there are no competing applications. Also, examination of an existinglicensee's track record must occur    even when significant differencesexist between competing proposals. As suggested by the Northern CaliforniaAgency's comments, an existing licensee's dismal track record could leadthe Commission to award a new license to a competitor despite the factthat the existing licensee's proposal was clearly superior to the competitor's.\250\<NOTE/> However, since the existing licensee's track record willbe the dispositive factor in cases of insignificant differences under allother applicable factors between the proposals of an existing licenseeand a competitor, the analysis required by section 15(a)(3) (A) and (B)will be the last one undertaken.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\250\ <T3>See </T3>H.R.

Other commenters \255\<NOTE/> suggest that some or all of the examples discussed in thepreamble be incorporated into the text of andSection; 16.13 to provide potentialapplicants with more guidance regarding the items the Commission will beconsidering so that applicants will be better able to determine what informationshould be provided to the Commission. Still others \256\<NOTE/> suggest that the Commission's development of the items itwill consider under the section 15(a) (2) and (3) factors be on a case-by-casebasis. They suggest that compilation at this time of any ``exclusive''list, either in andSection; 16.13 itself or in the preamble, could limitthe consideration of potentially relevant factors whose relevance may notbecome apparent until the Commission examines particular cases in the future.Finally, some commenters \257\<NOTE/> urge the Commission to clarify that not all of the examplesor factors may be relevant in every case.   <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\254\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>the comments of American Rivers. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\255\ American Paper, American Rivers, Southern CaliforniaEdison and Wisconsin Department. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\256\ EEI, Idaho Power and Northern California Agency. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\257\ American Paper and Long Lake.The discussion in the NOPR of the type of items the Commission will beexamining in carrying out its relicensing obligations was not intendedto create an exclusive list of all relevant relicensing considerationsunder section 15(a) (2) and (3) of the FPA. There may be items not referencedin the preamble that may be relevant in a particular case. Conversely,some of the referenced items or even some of the specific factors of thestatute may not be of any particular significance in an individual case.The Commission will evaluate any factor or item that may be significantto a particular proceeding, and will consider any arguments advanced byapplicants, competitors, resource agencies, interveners or others regardingthe appropriateness of evaluating a factor. Accordingly, the Commissiondeclines to develop a list of items and will address such matters on acase-by-case basis. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Section 15(a)(2)(A) of the Federal Power Act </ITAG>Section 15(a)(2)(A)\258\<NOTE/> of the FPA requires the Commission to consider the ``plansand abilities of the applicant to comply with (i) the articles, terms,and conditions of any license issued to it and (ii) with other applicableprovisions of [Part I of the FPA].'' In the NOPR, the Commission indicatedthat the Commission would consider such matters as the plans of an applicantto finance a project, an applicant's personnel, facilities and accomplishments,and whether an applicant has personnel adequate in number and trainingto construct any additional project works and to operate and maintain theproject in a competent manner.\259\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\258\ 16 U.S.C. 808(a)(2)(A) (1982 and Supp. 1988). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\259\ <T3>See </T3>NOPR preamble at 21-22. American Paper suggests that the Commission either further explain whatis meant by the word ``accomplishments,'' or delete the reference. It arguesthat the term is so broad as to be   meaningless and can be confused withthe track record examination required by section 15(a)(3) of the FPA. AmericanPaper also states that the Commission should be aware of the fact thatapplicants and licensees frequently hire outside contractors to performactivities related to a hydroelectric project. New York Electric requests that the Commission clarify that it will beconsidering an applicant's staff or staffing plan, rather than its personnel.It argues that the use of the word ``personnel'' implies that the Commissionwill be examining the qualifications of particular persons, which may changeover time. Public Pool and others suggest that the Commission determinewhether an applicant's personnel are adequate in number, training and experienceto operate and maintain the project. Long Lake indicates that some non-utility applicants are unable to enterinto power sales contracts until their licenses are issued. Therefore,it suggests that the Commission only inquire into whether applicants arecapable of arranging financing. Also, it suggests that the Commission notcompare which of the competing applicants is more capable of arrangingfinancing. Finally, the Northern California Agency suggests that the Commissioninquire into an existing licensee's past difficulties in complying withthe terms of a previous license in determining the existing licensee'sability to comply with a future license. The use of the word ``accomplishments'' in the NOPR was not intended tosuperimpose on to the section 15(a)(2)(A) analysis, the track record examinationrequired under section 15(a)(3). Rather, it was intended to encompass suchmatters as whether an applicant has past experience in hydroelectric mattersand, in the case of applicants that have never built or operated a hydroelectricproject, whether they have managed endeavors of a similar nature. With regard to the comments of the Northern California Agency, the Commissionwill not examine an existing licensee's compliance record under section15(a)(2)(A). This will be examined under section 15(a)(3). Examining thatrecord in the context of section 15(a)(2)(A) would result in double considerationof compliance factors. However, the Commission may under section 15(a)(2)(A)inquire into the reasons behind an existing licensee's past complianceproblems to help evaluate whether the existing licensee has corrected thesituation and thus is able to comply with the terms and conditions of anew license and other provisions of Part I of the FPA. As to the inquiry into personnel, the Commission does not intend to examinethe qualifications of individuals. Rather, it intends to consider whetherapplicants' and/or their contractors' overall staffing plans, includingnumbers of personnel and training programs, are adequate. Finally, the Commission recognizes that the ability of some applicantsto secure financing depends on the issuance of a license. Consequently,the Commission will consider an applicant's ability to secure financingon the assumption that a license will be issued. Also, while the Commissionwill not compare competing applicants' financing plans under section 15(a)(2)(A),any differences in those plans may be relevant to the inquiry into cost-effectivenessunder section 15(a)(2)(F) of the FPA.<ITAG tagnum="81">4.

However,as explained in the discussion under section 15(a)(2)(A), the reasons behindpast compliance problems can be considered under section 15(a)(2)(B) toevaluate whether an existing licensee has corrected the situation and thusis able to fulfill its future plans to safely manage, operate and maintainthe project. Also, certain aspects of an existing licensee's past safetyrecord,  such as the number of injuries to personnel, are not specificallyaddressed by Commission order or regulations, and thus are not properlyincluded under the compliance evaluation of section l5(a)(3).

They argue that the Commissionmust recognize the contractual obligation of the existing licensee to providepower to this other entity and, therefore, must consider as part of itsanalysis of the existing licensee's need for the power, the need of theexisting licensee for project power to fulfill its contractual obligationto serve this wholesale customer. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\268\ Pursuant to section 22 of the FPA, 16 U.S.C. 815 (1982),contracts to furnish power beyond the termination date of a license mustbe approved by the Commission and the state public service commission,and, if a new license is not issued to the original licensee upon expirationof the existing license, the new licensee shall assume and fulfill suchcontracts. The Commission recognizes that the legislative history of ECPA clearlyrequires the Commission to consider an applicant's need for power to serveits wholesale customers in cases where an applicant may not be able todirectly use all of the power from a project.\269\<NOTE/> Consequently, the Commission will consider wholesale powerneeds when appropriate.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\269\ <T3>See </T3>H.R.

This would, of course, have to take into account the benefitsto those purchasing the power, such as a reduction in rates, and wouldhave to be tempered by common sense and our intent that licenses oughtto be given to applicants who, among other things, actually need the projects.</ITAG>The Commission rejects the commenters' suggestion that it consider as partof the existing licensee's demand need for the power produced by the existingproject, the power being supplied to a wholesale customer who is competingwith the existing licensee for a new license for the project. First, adoptingthe commenters' argument would create a truly illusory ``need'' and upsetthe need analysis required by section 15(a)(2)(D) of the FPA.

In a case where an existing licensee is in competitionfor the project with one of its customers, the existing licensee is notto be permitted to include that customer in its demand projections to theextent that the customer will no longer be served by the existing licensee.Similarly, where an existing licensee is in competition with an independentpower producer, the Commission must recognize the possibility that thesmall power producer may sell the electricity from the project back tothe existing licensee. </ITAG>New York Electric states that the Commission should recognize that, inthe case of investor-owned utilities seeking relicensing of their own projects,the alternative source of power that the applicant is most likely to useto replace power under the license is power produced by the same projectoperated by others at a significantly increased cost to the utilities'ratepayers. The Northern California Agency argues that the needs analysisis not to be a headcounting test with the larger applicant prevailing,and that the needs analysis should be developed in the context of specificproceedings. Finally, the Department of Commerce argues that if there isno short-term need   for project power, then project development shouldbe cancelled, not postponed, and the alternatives analysis should be expandedto include a process for eliminating environmentally damaging alternatives.The Department of Commerce's statement regarding cancellation (and presumablyremoval) of existing projects in the absence of short-term need is contraryto the requirement of section 15(a)(2)(D) to consider both short- and long-termneed. It is also inconsistent with the legislative history of ECPA thatindicates that short-term power surpluses should not be the sole basisupon which to base the needs analysis.\271\<NOTE/> And it ignores the significant environmental consequencesassociated with removal and then reconstruction of existing hydroelectricfacilities.

New York Electric suggeststhat the Commission make clear that cost effectiveness will not be theprimary basis of comparing projects, since differences in benefit/costratios might reflect such things as different levels of reliability, witha more reliable plant having a lower benefit/cost ratio due to redundancyand greater quality. The Commission does not believe it has the authority to dismiss ``gold-plated''applications without fully completing the required relicensing analysis.However, a clearly gold-plated application will lose to a comparable cost-effectiveproposal submitted by a competitor.

Comparative Analysis of Fish and Wildlife Matters. </T3>Section15(a)(2)(G) of the FPA \276\<NOTE/> gives the Commission the authority during the relicensingprocess to consider ``such other factors as it may deem relevant.'' Indiscussing this provision in the NOPR, the Commission indicated that theplans of applicants concerning fish and wildlife will not be subject tocomparative evaluation. Citing to section 10(j) of the FPA, the Commissionstated that it will establish fish and wildlife conditions specific toeach project proposal pursuant to section 10 of the FPA. The Commissionalso stated that in cases where applicants propose different general schemesof development for the same project, it will determine whether the protection,mitigation and enhancement measures of each proposal are adequate underthe circumstances of that proposal, and will specify final conditions concerningfish and wildlife in the issued license.\277\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\276\ 16 U.S.C. 808(a)(2)(G) (1982 and Supp. 1988). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\277\ <T3>See </T3>NOPR preamble at 31-32.

However, the Commission believes that its revisionof andSection; 16.13 to reference the statute will clearly show that comparativeevaluation is prohibited.Washington Wildlife suggests that the Commission revise the regulationsto include the criteria it will use to establish fish and wildlife conditions.The Department of Commerce also recommends specific standards. It suggeststhat the Commission specify that it will look first at each proposal'splans and capabilities for protection and mitigation and then look at theproposal's potential for enhancement and compensation. According to Commerce,the overriding principle should be that adverse impacts from past and futureactions must be fully addressed through protection and mitigation and thatenhancement must be  provided where such opportunities exist. Finally,although not entirely clear on this point, Commerce appears to argue thatit would be inappropriate to evaluate the benefits and costs of protectionand mitigation measures incrementally, and that such measures must be evaluatedin the context of total costs and revenues, presumably over the entirelife of the project. The Commission is unable to specify precise criteria that it will use inestablishing fish and wildlife conditions. The development of such measureswill be on a case-by-case basis, pursuant to section 10 of the FPA andthe provisions of section 10(j) regarding adequate and equitable protection,mitigation and enhancement measures and consistency with the purposes andrequirements of Part I of the FPA. The Commission may evaluate whetherenhancement of fish and wildlife resources, which may constitute a reductionof the negative impacts attributable to a project since its construction,would be appropriate. But, as explained previously,\280\<NOTE/> the evaluation and consideration of the appropriateness ofrequiring fish and wildlife measures is to be in the context of today'senvironment, and in relation to today's needs and problems. Thus, contraryto Commerce's position, there is no set requirement that all past damageto fish and wildlife caused by a project must be ``mitigated'' in a relicensingproceeding.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\280\ <T3>See </T3>Part IV.H.3.b., <T3>supra.</T3>In addition, while the Commission agrees that adequate fish and wildlifemeasures are a cost of doing business, it finds without merit Commerce'sapparent argument that the cost of fish and wildlife measures proposedat relicensing can only be considered in the context of total costs andrevenues over the life of a project. Such an approach would sanction theadoption of any fish and wildlife measure, no matter how expensive, aslong as the costs of the fish and wildlife measure were less expensivethan the total of the net revenues of the project over the term of theprevious license and the expected net revenues of the project over theterm of the new license. Once again, this type of approach ignores thefact that fish and wildlife measures at relicensing must be consideredin the context of today's costs, needs and problems.\281\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\281\ The Departments of Commerce and the Interior, WildlifeFederation and other commenters suggest that the Commission explain inthe regulations how the FPA sections 10(j) and 18 processes will be integratedinto the relicensing process.

Antitrust.</T3> In the NOPR, the Commission stated that it willconsider the antitrust provision of section 10(h) of the FPA\282\<NOTE/> during relicensing but that applications would not be subjectto a comparative evaluation on that issue. The NOPR cited the ECPA ConferenceReport in support of this position.\283\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\282\ 16 U.S.C. 803(h) (1982 and Supp. 1988).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\283\ <T3>See </T3>H.R.

The Commission believes that the statute clearly does not contain a requirementfor comparative evaluation of applications on section 10(h) grounds. Moreover,the conferees' statement makes clear the intent of Congress that the Commissionnot subject applications to comparative evaluation on antitrust matters.Furthermore, section 10(h) itself does not require comparative evaluationof antitrust matters at relicensing. Paragraph (2) of section 10(h), whichwas added by ECPA, only requires the Commission: (1) To include in issuedlicenses, conditions to prevent or adequately minimize any unjustifiedcontravention of the policies expressed in the antitrust laws; and (2)to refuse to issue a new license to an existing licensee if it is impossibleto prevent or adequately minimize the contravention. Thus, although antitrustmatters will not be subject to comparative evaluation, the proposal ofan existing licensee found superior to a competitor's as a result of thecomparative analysis required by section 15(a) (2) and (3) will have tobe reviewed pursuant to section 10(h) as is the current practice of theCommission. <T3>c. Requirements of Section 10. </T3>As indicated previously, section15(a)(2) of the FPA requires the Commission to consider the requirementsof section 10 of the FPA in evaluating applications for new license undersection 15(a). As discussed in the NOPR,\284\<NOTE/> this requires consideration of all section 10 proceduresand requirements. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\284\ <T3>See </T3>NOPR preamble at 16-19. Specifically, these requirements include the mandate of section 10(a)(1)that a project adopted shall be ``best adapted to a comprehensive planfor improving or developing'' the waterway after consideration of all beneficialpublic uses. Section 10(a)(1), in turn, requires the Commission to considerall purposes referred to in section 4(e) of the FPA. Section 4(e) requiresthe Commission to give equal consideration to the purposes of energy conservation,the protection, mitigation of damage to, and enhancement of, fish and wildlife(including relating spawning ground and habitat), the protection of recreationalopportunities, and the preservation of other aspects of environmental quality,in addition to the power and development purposes for which a license isissued.\285\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\285\ As indicated in Part IV.K.8.a., <T3>supra</T3>, fish and wildlife matters are not subject to comparativeevaluation.

Section 10(a)(2)(B) requires the Commission to consider the recommendationsof Federal and state agencies exercising administration over flood control,navigation, irrigation, recreation, cultural, and other relevant resourcesof the state in which the project is located, and the recommendations (includingfish and wildlife recommendations) of Indian tribes affected by the project.Section 10(a)(3) requires the Commission to solicit recommendations fromthose agencies and Indian tribes for proposed terms and conditions to beconsidered by the Commission for inclusion in the license. Section 10(a)(2)(C) requires the Commission to consider the electricityconsumption efficiency improvement program of the applicant, includingits plans, performance, and capabilities for encouraging or assisting itscustomers to conserve electricity cost-effectively, taking into accountthe published policies, restrictions, and requirements of relevant stateregulatory authorities applicable to such applicant.

Section 15(a)(3) of the Federal Power Act </ITAG>As discussed previously,\288\<NOTE/> the Commission is revising andSection; 16.13 to track preciselythe language of section 15(a)(3) (A) and (B). This will clarify that bothan existing licensee's record of compliance with the terms and conditionsof the existing license under section 15(a)(3)(A), and the actions takenby an existing licensee which affect the public under section 15(a)(3)(B),will be considered by the Commission. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\288\ <T3>See</T3> Part IV.K.1., <T3>supra</T3>. In discussing the provisions of section 15(a)(3) in the NOPR, the Commissioncited a number of examples of the types of matters that will be examinedunder section 15(a)(3). These examples include an existing licensee's:(1) Compliance with the Commission's general policies on recreational useof project facilities; (2) cooperation with appropriate resource agenciesto reduce the project's detrimental impact on fish, wildlife and otherresources; (3) setting aside of land adjacent to the project for futureenvironmental purposes; and (4) willingness to adopt measures ensuringthe safety of the public. The Commission requested comments on these andother criteria that it should consider under section 15(a)(3).\289\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\289\ <T3>See</T3> NOPR preamble at 20. A number of commenters question the examples listed in the NOPR, statingthat they either are incorrectly classified as compliance matters undersection 15(a)(3)(A) when they should instead be considered under section15(a)(3)(B), or may not be relevant in all cases. For example, EEI andothers \290\<NOTE/> point out that prior to 1963,\291\<NOTE/> the Commission did not require applicants to include recreationaldevelopment plans in their applications and that the Commission did notdevelop its formal recreational policies until 1965.\292\<NOTE/> These commenters also state that the Commission specificallyindicated that these recreational requirements and policies were not toapply to existing licenses. They therefore contend that an existing licenseenot subject to these recreational provisions should not be penalized underthe compliance factor of section 15(a)(3)(A) for failing to comply withthese provisions. Furthermore, they contend that, if an existing licenseevoluntarily implements some of these recreational provisions, this positiveaction should be considered in favor of an existing licensee pursuant tosection 15(a)(3)(B) of the FPA. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\290\ <T3>See, e.g.,</T3> the comments of Alabama Power. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\291\ <T3>See</T3> 29 F.P.C. 777 (1963) and 33 F.P.C. 32 (1965). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\292\ <T3>See </T3>34 F.P.C. 1546 (1965). Similar concerns are raised by EEI, Idaho Power and American Paper regardingthe setting aside of land. They point out that, unless specifically requiredby a license provision, the failure of an existing licensee to set asideland is not a compliance factor under section 15(a)(3)(A), and that anyvoluntary setting aside of land by an existing licensee should be consideredas a positive factor under section 15(a)(3)(B). American Paper also cautionsthat, in reviewing the extent of an existing licensee's cooperation withresource agencies to voluntarily lessen environmental impacts, the Commissionmust consider the reasonableness of any agency requests. These comments accurately reflect the type of analysis the Commission willundertake pursuant to section 15(a)(3). Unless specifically required bythe terms and conditions of an existing license, an existing licensee'sactions regarding recreational development and the setting aside of landwill be considered in the context of section 15(a)(3)(B), not section 15(a)(3)(A),of the FPA. Furthermore, all analysis under section 15(a)(3)(B) will haveto take into account all relevant factors, including the ability of anexisting licensee to engage in such matters. Thus, in cases where such recreational development at the site would havebeen impracticable or impossible, the failure of an existing licensee tovoluntarily provide for recreational development when not required by itslicense will not be weighed against the licensee under section 15(b)(3)(B).Conversely, where an existing licensee voluntarily provides for such development,that action will be weighed in favor of the licensee under section 15(b)(3)(B).American Rivers suggests that the Commission clarify that section 15(a)(3)(A)of the FPA requires consideration of an existing licensee's compliancewith all terms and conditions of the existing license. Seattle Light suggeststhat the Commission articulate in the regulations the specific complianceand public interest matters the Commission will consider. EPA suggeststhat a licensee's cooperation with resource agencies in lessening a project'sdetrimental impacts on water quality and wetlands be considered under section15(a)(3). American Paper states that the existing licensee's willingnessto quickly correct safety problems and its maintenance of project worksshould be considered. The Wisconsin Department suggests that the extent of public participationafforded by the licensee, the quality of the licensee's data and submittals,and the lack of controversy on study and mitigation recommendations shouldbe considered. New York Electric suggests that an existing licensee's unitavailability record and productivity be evaluated. Finally, Wildlife Federationsuggests that the Commission consider, in the context of section 15(a)(2)(G)of the FPA, an existing licensee's record of compliance with the licensesit holds. The Commission will evaluate an existing licensee's compliance with allprovisions of its license. This includes all provisions of Part I of theFPA incorporated into the license and regulatory provisions generally applicableto all licensees, such as the Commission's regulations regarding dam safety.\293\<NOTE/> However, as discussed previously,\294\<NOTE/> the Commission does not believe it is appropriate or possibleto incorporate into regulatory language all factors that will be consideredunder section 15(a)(3) (A) and (B) or section 15(a)(2). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\293\ <T3>See</T3> 18 CFR Part 12 (1988). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\294\ <T3>See</T3> Part IV.K.2., <T3>supra</T3>. Congress has provided an express directive in section 15(a)(3)(A) to consideran existing licensee's record of compliance ``with the terms and conditionsof <T3>the</T3> existing license'' (emphasis added). Thus, the Commissiondoes not believe it would be consistent with the intent of ECPA to examine,in the context of either section 15(a)(2)(G) or section 15(a)(3)(A), theexisting licensee's record of compliance with all other licenses it holds.With regard to the suggestions of EPA, American Paper, and New York Electric,those matters will be considered if relevant under section 15(a)(3) (A)or (B), depending on the specific requirements and provisions of the existinglicense. As to the Wisconsin Department's suggestion regarding analysisof public participation, this might be a factor that could be consideredunder section 15(a)(3)(B). However, the other two items referenced by theWisconsin Department appear to be inappropriate for examination under section15(a)(3), since they pertain to matters related to the filing of an applicationfor new license, not to matters related to an existing licensee's conduct.In a related matter, the Northern California Agency argues that the Commissionshould treat as a negative factor in its section 15(a)(3)(B) evaluation,an existing licensee's past assertion of rights under section 6 of theFPA to block a superior use of a nearby project's water supplies. The Commissiondeclines to adopt this suggestion. An existing licensee should not be penalizedfor legitimately relying on the section 6 prohibition against unilateralalteration of licenses, to protect its ability to operate its project inthe manner allowed and required by the existing license. Thus, an existinglicensee's reliance on FPA section 6 will not be considered as a negativefactor under the section l5(a)(3)(B) evaluation. In summary, while an existinglicensee's compliance with specific obligations or responsibilities underits license will be examined under section 15(a)(3), its exercise of legitimaterights provided by the license or the FPA will not. L. Information Required of Applicants In the NOPR, the Commission proposed to require applicants for new licenseto submit certain information not currently required by the regulations.\295\<NOTE/> The Commission needs that information to conduct its evaluationsunder sections 15(a) (2) and (3) of the FPA, meet the information requirementof section 15(b)(4) of the FPA,\296\<NOTE/> and carry out its obligations under section 10(a) (1) and(2) of the FPA. These requirements, proposed to be codified in andSection;16.10, were divided into three parts: (1) information to be supplied byall applicants (proposed andSection; 16.10(a)); (2) information to be suppliedby an  applicant who is an existing licensee (proposed andSection; 16.10(b));and (3) information to be supplied by an applicant who is not an existinglicensee (proposed andSection; 16.10(c)). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\295\ <T3>See </T3>18 CFR 4.41, 4.51 and 4.61 (1988). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\296\ 16 U.S.C. 808(b)(4) (1982 and Supp. 1988). <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Procedures and Format </ITAG>EEI, Great Northern and others state that andSection; 16.10 is unclear onwhen and how the information required under the section is to be providedto the Commission. Great Northern suggests that the Commission specifythat the andSection; 16.10 information be included at a single place in thelicense application. EEI suggests that the Commission specify that theinformation required by andSection; 16.10 be included in a separate documentfiled with the Commission on the date the corresponding license applicationis filed. EEI also recommends that applicants be provided with the optionof circulating the information required by the section to resource agenciesfor review and comment prior to filing the information with the Commission.The Commission believes that the information required by andSection; 16.10should be incorporated at a single place in the license application, andthat resource agencies should be provided with an opportunity to reviewand comment on this information in reviewing draft applications submittedto them pursuant to andSection; 16.8(c)(4). Incorporation of this informationinto license applications will facilitate Commission processing and considerationof applications, and will provide resource agencies with additional timeto fully evaluate and comment on the information required by andSection;16.10. Also, the information on costs and impacts to the applicant's customersrequired by andSection; 16.10 may assist resource agencies in formulatingrecommended terms and conditions that strike a reasonable balance betweenthe protection, mitigation and enhancement of environmental resources andthe needs of an applicant and its customers. Accordingly, the Commissionis adding a new paragraph andSection; 16.10(e) that specifies that the andSection;16.10 information is to be included in the license application as a separateexhibit labeled ``Exhibit H.'' EEI, National Hydropower, PGandamp;E and Washington Power suggest that andSection;16.10 be revised to specify that the information to be provided only hasto be ``commensurate with the scope of the project.'' They contend thatthis revision is necessary to address the fact that not all of the specificitems of information may be relevant for all projects, particularly smallones. Wisconsin Power raises similar concerns regarding the relevance ofall of the specific information items to minor projects. The Commission declines to adopt the suggestion made by these commenters.The ``commensurate with the scope of the project'' language could be interpretedby some potential applicants as excusing them from having to address allof the items of information required by andSection; 16.10. All of the itemsmust be discussed by applicants. However, the Commission recognizes thatnot all of the items may be particularly relevant to an individual project.Consequently, if a potential applicant does not believe a particular itemis relevant to its project, it can explain why in addressing the item.Also, the level of detail that must be provided will vary according tothe size of the project and the circumstances of each case.\297\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\297\ Washington Power and Wisconsin Power also request thatholders of minor licenses not subject to sections 14 and 15 of the FPAnot be required to provide the andSection; 16.10 information. This requestis discussed in Part IV.P., <T3>infra.</T3>EEI states that some of its members are part of integrated electric systemsthat conduct resource studies on a system-wide or regional basis. Therefore,EEI suggests that andSection; 16.10 be revised to permit applicants thatare part of an integrated system to submit the load, cost and other resourcedata required by andSection; 16.10 on a system-wide basis. American Paperand Friends of the Earth suggest that it would be helpful to applicantsto segregate the andSection; 16.10 information items into separate sectionscorresponding to the section 15(a) (2) and (3) provisions to which theinformation items pertain. The Commission does not believe it is necessary to make the revision suggestedby EEI. Nothing in andSection; 16.10 prohibits applicants from submittingthe information in the format suggested by EEI, as long as the informationis sufficiently detailed to enable the Commission to evaluate the informationitem in the context of the individual project proposal. The Commissiondeclines to segregate the andSection; 16.10 information, as requested byAmerican Paper and Friends of the Earth, since some of the informationitems may be relevant to more than one  provision of section 15(a) (2)or (3) or other provisions of the FPA.\298\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\298\ American Rivers states that the regulations are ambiguousas to whether applicants for nonpower licenses must provide the informationspecified in andSection; 16.10 and suggest that the regulations need to beclarified on this point. The Commission does not believe any revision isnecessary, since andSection; 16.10 is limited to applicants for ``new license,''which, under the definitions of andSection; 16.2, would not include applicationsfor nonpower license. Applications for nonpower license must include theinformation specified in andSection; 16.11, not andSection; 16.10. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Specific Information Requests  </ITAG>As discussed previously,\299\<NOTE/> in evaluating an applicant's need for a project the Commissionis required to consider the need of an applicant for project power to servewholesale customers. Accordingly, and as requested by some of the commenters,\300\<NOTE/> the Commission is revising appropriate provisions of andSection;16.10 to specifically reference wholesale customers.\301\<NOTE/>   <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\299\ <T3>See </T3>Part IV.K.6., <T3>supra.</T3> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\300\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>the comments of Public Pool and Mid-Columbia. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\301\ <T3>See </T3>andSection; 16.10(a)(2)(i) and (iii)(A).The Commission is also revising proposed andSection; 16.10(b)(7) to substitutethe phrase ``a discussion of any actions taken by the existing licenseerelated to the project which affect the public'' for the phrase ``a summaryof any acquisition of land or land rights associated with the project.''This change, which was requested by some of the commenters,\302\<NOTE/> is consistent with the  previous discussion regarding thescope of section 15(a)(3)(B) of the FPA.\303\<NOTE/>   <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\302\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>the comments of EEI and PGandamp;E. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\303\ <T3>See </T3>Part IV.K.9., <T3>supra.</T3>As indicated previously,\304\<NOTE/> the Commission will be examining applicants' general staffingplans as part of the analysis it will undertake pursuant to section 15(a)(2)(A)of the FPA. The Commission is amending proposed andSection; 16.10(a)(9) torequire the submittal of more specific information in this regard.\305\<NOTE/>   <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\304\ <T3>See </T3>Part IV.K.3., <T3>supra.</T3> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\305\ This revision was suggested by several commenters, includingPublic Pool.A number of commenters \306\<NOTE/> suggest that andSection; 16.10 be revised to require applicantsto discuss the environmental effects of their proposals and/or the mattersaddressed during the consultation process with resource agencies. Thesesuggested changes are unnecessary. The Commission's regulations governingthe content of the Environmental Reports that are to be included in applications,\307\<NOTE/> which govern applications for new license, and the provisionsof andSection; 16.8 requiring the documentation of resource agency consultation,will ensure that this information will be provided.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\306\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>Trout Unlimited, Michigan Department, Montana Fishand Wildlife, and Washington Wildlife. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\307\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>18 CFR 4.51(f) (1988).The Department of Commerce and the EPA suggest that andSection; 16.10 berevised to require applicants, when discussing alternative sources of powerand the impacts on them and their customers of relying on alternative sourcesof power should an applicant not receive a license for the project, toalso discuss the environmental impacts of such alternatives. The Commissionagrees that the environmental impacts of alternatives will have to be consideredin evaluating applications for new license. However, the Commission believesthat it would be more appropriate to have the collection of such informationaddressed in the post-filing phase of application processing, through additionalinformation requests. This will permit the Commission to ascertain thespecific information gaps that need addressing, and to limit the informationdemands to those alternatives that it believes are most reasonable. The Department of Commerce suggests that proposed andSection; 16.10(a)(11),which requires applicants to provide a statement regarding the consistencyof their proposals with state and Federal comprehensive plans describedin section 10(a)(2)(A) of the FPA, be revised to more accurately trackthe language of section 10(a)(2)(A). Commerce also suggests that proposedandSection; 16.10(a)(8) be revised to more accurately track the comprehensivedevelopment language of section 10(a)(1) of the FPA. The Commission is deleting proposed andSection; 16.10(a)(11), since it isunnecessary in light of the provisions of andSection; 16.8(f)(6). The Commissionis, however, revising proposed andSection; 16.10(a) (7) and (8) to more accuratelyreflect the provisions of section 10(a)(1) of the FPA. In a related matter, Washington Ecology requests that applicants discussingthe conformity of their projects with a comprehensive plan for improvingor developing the waterway, be required to conduct studies and collectdata regarding all competing uses of the water to be used by their projects.The Commission declines to adopt this suggestion, since it would placean impossible burden on applicants. The Commission's regulations governingthe content of Environmental Reports for applications already require applicantsto generally discuss project impacts on reasonable competing uses of thewaterway. The Commission believes that the obligation to supply specificdata and conduct studies regarding competing uses of the waterway restswith the resource agencies that are responsible for overseeing these otheruses. Thus, if a resource agency believes that a proposed project wouldconflict with another use of the waterway, it can present its positionto the Commission and submit any studies or data regarding the other useof the waterway it believes support its position. Finally, Wildlife Federation, Friends of the Earth and the Department ofCommerce suggest that the provisions of andSection; 16.10 pertaining to thesubmittal of information on conservation be modified to ensure that allapplicants will adequately address and consider conservation as an alternative.The Commission does not believe any changes in this regard are necessary,since andSection; 16.10(a)(3)(ii)(A) and (C), and redesignated (a)(11), clearlyrequire that the conservation alternative be addressed. The Commissionfully intends to consider conservation and other load management measuresin evaluating applications for relicense.\308\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\308\ Rochester Gas suggests that andSection; 16.10(a)(10) berevised to require applicants proposing to expand project lands to showthat the expansion is necessary and economically justifiable. This changeis unnecessary, since these issues will have to be addressed in filed licenseapplications pursuant to the Commission's regulations regarding the contentof applications (18 CFR 4.41, 4.51, 4.61 (1988)). <ITAG tagnum="28">Rochester Gas also questions the reference to 18 CFR andSection; 4.35(1988) in proposed andSection; 16.10(a)(13)(i)(B). The purpose of this provisionwas to make clear that applicants must obtain new water quality certificationunder section 401(a)(1) of the Clean Water Act if they materially changetheir proposals after filing their license applications with the Commission.The general applicability of 18 CFR andSection; 4.35 (1988) to relicensingproceedings is discussed in Part IV. J.4., </ITAG><T3>supra</T3>. In order to eliminate confusion, the Commission is mergingthe water quality certification provisions of proposed andSection; 16.10(a)(13)with the related provisions in proposed andSection; 16.8(f)(3) (redesignatedandSection; 16.8(f)(7) by this final rule). The Commission also notes thatthe obligation of applicants for new license to obtain water quality certification(or waiver) for their proposals will generally be met in the case of anexisting licensee where any pre-existing water quality certification forits project would be applicable to the proposal for which it seeks to obtaina new license.  M. Joint Applicants In the NOPR, the Commission stated that it generally should not consideran existing licensee to be an existing licensee for purposes of section15 of the FPA and the Commission's relicensing regulations if the licenseefiles an application for a new license in conjunction with another entityor entities that  are not current licensees of the project.\309\<NOTE/> Accordingly, the Commission indicated in andSection; 16.13(c)that such joint applicants would not be considered existing licensees.However, the Commission also solicited comments on whether there were circumstancesunder which an existing licensee should retain that status in applyingfor a new license if it has joined with other venturers in its application.\310\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\309\ <T3>See</T3> NOPR preamble at 5. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\310\ <T3>See</T3> NOPR preamble at 6. A number of commenters \311\<NOTE/> agree with the Commission's proposed approach, contendingthat it is consistent with the Commission's policy regarding the non-availabilityof municipal preference to hybrid applicants.\312\<NOTE/> Some contend that in no case should joint applicants be consideredan existing licensee, while others contend that existing licensee statusshould be afforded to joint applicants only if the new entity to be addedwill have no operating responsibilities.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\311\ <T3>See, e.g.</T3>, the comments of American Rivers, the Department ofCommerce, Long Lake, Grant County PUD, Wildlife Federation, and New YorkElectric. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\312\ <T3>See</T3> City of Fayetteville Public Works Commission, 16 FERC andpara;61,209 (1981) (Fayetteville), where the Commission determined that municipaland non-municipal applicants filing joint applications for original license,referred to as ``hybrid applicants,'' are not entitled to municipal preferenceunder section 7(a) of the FPA.The majority of the commenters, however, oppose the Commission's proposedpolicy.\313\<NOTE/> They contend that the joinder of new entities with existinglicensees may be financially beneficial to the customers of the existinglicensees; such joinder may permit the use of lower cost financing techniquesthat would not be available to the existing licensees alone. They thereforeargue that it would be contrary to the public interest to deprive existinglicensees of the ability to reduce the costs of redevelopment to theircustomers through the use of these financing techniques. Consequently,they request that the Commission either reverse its position or at leastdefer a decision on this issue and make such determinations on a case-by-casebasis, applying relevant policy considerations to the particular factspresented.\314\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\313\ <T3>See</T3>, <T3>e.g.</T3>, the comments of Alabama Power, EEI, Georgia Power, NationalHydropower, Niagara Mohawk, Fourth Branch, PGandamp;E, Wisconsin Departmentand Washington Power. The Small Business Administration states that itsupports the Commission's proposed policy, but that the Commission shouldnot prevent joint applicants when the added party's only role will be toprovide necessary financing for improvements. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\314\ The Warm Springs Tribe suggests that andSection; 16.13(c)be revised so that an existing licensee that files a relicense applicationfor a complete project in conjunction with an entity that is an existinglicensee for only part of the same project be considered an existing licenseefor purposes of section 15 of the FPA. Clearly, one of the purposes of the insignificant differences provisionof section 15(a)(2) is to avoid the disruptions and economic dislocationsthat an existing licensee's customers would suffer in the event of a licensetransfer, unless   there is a strong public interest reason for a transfer.Consequently, and as pointed out by the commenters in opposition to andSection;16.13(c), as long as the customers of an existing licensee would not beadversely affected financially or in terms of power availability, relicenseapplications filed jointly by existing licensees and new entities wouldnot cause disruptions and economic dislocations. However, and as discussedbelow, the Commission does not believe the possibility that existing customersmay not be adversely affected in some cases justifies the elimination ofandSection; 16.l3(c). First, adoption of the proposition that joint applicants should be consideredexisting licensees would have to be premised upon the situation describedabove: no adverse financial or power availability impacts to the customersof the existing licensee. Consequently, the Commission would be requiredto examine these two factual issues on a case-by-case basis following thefiling of a joint development application. This in turn would require theCommission to ascertain such things as the appropriate past and futurecustomer base, and financing terms and rates, for alternative developmentscenarios (one with the new entity and the existing licensee, one withonly the existing licensee). In addition to being time- and resource-consuming,this case-by-case analysis would not provide the bright-line test existinglicensees and potential competitors need in order to responsibly weightheir development options.Second, while Congress was concerned about economic dislocations and disruptionsthat might be suffered by the customers of an existing licensee, thereis no indication in the legislative history of ECPA that Congress contemplated,let alone sanctioned, the wholesale selling of portions of existing licensees'projects and future revenue streams to third parties heretofore unrelatedto the existing licensee. Indeed, Congress' reference in section 15(a)(3)to the track record of <T3>the </T3>existing licensee, and its intent that the track record beused to determine which applicant should receive a new license in the caseof insignificant differences, indicates that Congress intended for theindirect benefits of the insignificant differences provision of section15(a)(2) to flow only to the exact entity that was the current existinglicensee of the project. Finally, not considering a joint application as one filed by an existinglicensee will not significantly impair the existing licensee's abilityto enter into financing arrangements with third parties that may ultimatelybenefit the customers of the existing licensee. As the Commission has heldpreviously, financial arrangements between licensees and non-licensees<ITAG tagnum="20">are permissible, provided licensees maintain in such arrangementssufficient ownership and control of a project to enable the Commission,through its licensee, to carry out its regulatory responsibilities withrespect to that project. Any non-licensee who for financing or other purposesowns or controls rights necessary for the operation of the projects mustalso be made a co-licensee.</ITAG><T3>See City of New Martinsville, West Virginia, </T3>32 FERC andpara;61,261at 61,636 (1985).\315\<NOTE/> The above-mentioned standard regarding when financiers andother entities must be added as co-applicants will be fully applicableto relicense proceedings. Thus, as long as the existing licensee will retainsufficient ownership and control, a third party financier will not haveto be added to an existing licensee's application for new license and theexisting licensee will not be jeopardizing its status as an existing licenseeunder section 15(a)(2).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\315\ <T3>See </T3>El Dorado Irrigation District and El Dorado Water Agency,29 FERC andpara;61,375 (1984); Linweave, Inc. 23 FERC andpara;61,391 (1983);and New York State Electric andamp; Gas Corp., 23 FERC andpara;61,034 (1983),for examples of financing and ownership arrangements that do not requirejoinder of the financier as a co-applicant or co-licensee. In light of the above, the Commission is retaining paragraph (c) in andSection;16.13, with slight revisions to accommodate the unique situation raisedby the Warm Springs Tribe,\316\<NOTE/> and to clarify the effect of the section. An existing licenseefiling an application for new license in conjunction with a new entitywill not have the status of an existing licensee for the purpose of theinsignificant differences provision of section 15(a)(2). In all other respects,an existing licensee filing in conjunction with a new entity must followthe same procedures and will have its application processed in the samemanner as an existing licensee filing individually.\317\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\316\ <T3>See </T3>discussion, <T3>supra.</T3><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\317\ Long lake is concerned that not treating joint applicantsas existing licensees may interfere with the Commission's ability to issueannual licenses to the existing licensee pursuant to section 15(a)(1) ofthe FPA, 16 U.S.C. 808(a)(1) (1982 and Supp. 1988). The Commission's authorityto issue annual licenses would not be affected by not treating joint applicantsas existing licensees, since the Commission would in such situations issuean annual license to the holder of the existing license.  Finally, the Northern California Agency expresses concern that an existinglicensee might add a co-applicant in order to avoid consideration of anexisting licensee's poor track record in complying with the terms and conditionsof its existing license. However, since examination of an existing licensee'strack record is a relevant consideration under section 10 of the FPA, andsince section 10 is applicable to relicensing proceedings, the Commissionwill fully consider an existing licensee's track record in every case wherean existing licensee chooses to file a relicense application in conjunctionwith a new entity, even though the joint entity will not be consideredan existing licensee for purposes of the insignificant differences provisionof section 15(a)(2).\318\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\318\ Wildlife Federation suggests that the Commission promulgatea regulation requiring heightened scrutiny of license transfer applicationsand forbidding license transfers during the last five years of an existinglicense. Wildlife Federation contends that this is necessary to preventthird parties from buying out existing licensees merely to obtain an advantagein relicensing. The Commission declines to adopt a prohibition againsttransfers during the last five years of a license, since there are legitimatepublic interest purposes served by such transfers. However, the Commissionwill scrutinize all such transfer requests to determine if the transfer'sprimary purpose is to gain an advantage at relicensing, such as when atransfer is intended to escape consideration of a poor compliance record.The Commission may deny a transfer request in such a situation or takeother appropriate action, such as imputing the transferor's poor compliancerecord to the transferee in considering the transferee's application forrelicense.N. Annual Licenses Section 15(a)(1) of the FPA provides that<ITAG tagnum="20">[i]n the event the United States does not exercise the right to takeover or does not issue a license to a new licensee, or issue a new licenseto the existing licensee, upon reasonable terms, then the Commission </ITAG><T3>shall </T3>issue from year to year an annual license to the then licenseeunder the terms and conditions of the existing license until the propertyis taken over or a new license is issued as aforesaid. [Emphasis added.]In the NOPR, the Commission proposed in andSection; 16.18 to codify in regulatorylanguage the annual licensing provisions of section 15(a)(1), and to specifythe circumstances where an annual license would be issued.\319\<NOTE/> In addition, the Commission proposed to codify its long standingpractice of considering annual licenses automatically renewed without furtherorder of the Commission if processing of relicense and other applications,and takeover proceedings, are not completed prior to expiration of thecurrent annual license.\320\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\319\ Proposed andSection; 16.18(b). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\320\ Proposed andSection; 16.18(c). A number of commenters object to the automatic renewal provision of andSection;16.18(c). American Rivers contends that the provision should be revisedto prevent the issuance of an unlimited number of annual licenses untilaction is taken on any pending applications. It contends that the legislativehistory of ECPA indicates that Congress did not intend to allow the Commissionto use annual licenses to delay the changes that will be implemented aspart of a new license. Friends of the Earth suggests that andSection; 16.18(c)be deleted and replaced with a provision stating that each annual licensewill include a schedule for completing studies during the term of the annuallicense, and a projected date by which the Commission intends to completeaction on pending applications. Wildlife Federation also objects to the automatic renewal provisions ofandSection; 16.l8(c), contending that this will permit existing licenseesto delay relicensing proceedings for years. It suggests that the initialannual license include a schedule for completion of the relicensing proceeding,and that the Commission be required to issue each subsequent annual license.Also, Wildlife Federation suggests that the Commission revise andSection;16.l8 to specify that, if the existing license contains reopener provisions,the Commission will use its authority under such reopener provisions toimpose new terms and conditions on the annual license. The Department of Commerce makes similar suggestions, although it suggeststhat the Commission specify that it has the authority to impose new termsand conditions for the protection of fish and wildlife resources in everycase if necessary. The Northern California Agency suggests that in casesinvolving competition, and if the relicensing process has not been completedwithin three years from the expiration date of the existing license, theexisting licensee should be required to pay a competing applicant a totalof one-half the net value of holding the license during the post-expirationperiod. Finally, Washington Wildlife suggests that the section be revisedto specify that the Commission will require fish and wildlife mitigationmeasures to be undertaken during the annual license.The Commission declines to make any of these suggested revisions. As theCommission explained in the <T3>Central Nebraska Public Power and Irrigation District (Central Nebraska)</T3>case,\321\<NOTE/> the provision of section 15(a)(1) of the FPA regarding theissuance of annual licenses ``under the terms and conditions of the existinglicense'' until the relicensing or takeover proceeding is completed, ismandatory. The issuance of an annual license is a ministerial and non-discretionaryact. Thus, although the Commission is cognizant of ECPA's mandate of expedition,the Commission is required to issue annual licenses    under the exactterms and conditions of the existing license \322\<NOTE/> and has no authority to impose additional terms and conditionsregarding schedules, deadlines or payment requirements.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\321\ 39 FERC andpara; 61,378 (1987), <T3>reh'g denied, </T3>43 FERC andpara; 61,225 (1988), <T3>appeal pending sub nom. </T3>Platte River Whooping Crane Critical HabitatMaintenance Trust v. FERC, No. 88-1425 (D.C. Cir. filed June 15, 1988).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\322\ As suggested by Washington Wildlife, the Commissionis revising andSection; 16.18(b) to clarify that the annual license willbe under the terms and conditions of the existing license.  Furthermore, unless the terms and conditions of the existing license reserveto the Commission the authority to impose on the existing licensee, andtherefore in the annual license, additional appropriate conditions forthe protection of fish, wildlife or other resources, the Commission hasno authority to impose on annual licenses additional conditions for theprotection of these resources. However, even when the Commission has reservedauthority to do so, it cannot impose additional conditions for the protectionof these resources unless those additional conditions are based on substantialevidence.\323\<NOTE/> In most cases annual licenses will be used to provide theCommission with sufficient time to analyze and resolve factual issues regardingwhat conditions should be imposed in a new license. Therefore, it is doubtfulthat the Commission in many cases will have available to it prior to thecompletion of the relicensing proceeding the substantial evidence neededto support the    imposition of additional terms and conditions in an annuallicense.\324\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\323\ <T3>See </T3>section 313(b) of the FPA, 16 U.S.C. 8251 (1982). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\324\ The Wisconsin Department suggests that the section berevised to specify that annual licenses can be issued to allow applicantstime to complete additional necessary prelicensing studies. This revisionis unnecessary, since a purpose of the annual licensing provision is toallow the Commission to complete the relicensing process, which would includethe gathering of necessary study materials and data.  The fact that the Commission has no discretionary authority with regardto annual licenses does not mean, however, that the Commission will notbe able to prevent existing licensees from delaying relicensing proceedings.As discussed previously,\325\<NOTE/> the Commission will be establishing deadlines pursuant toandSection;andSection; 16.9(b) and 4.32 of the Commission's regulations forthe submittal of additional information and correction of application deficiencies.Existing licensees and other applicants that attempt to delay the proceedingsby delaying their responses to deficiency correction and additional informationrequests could have their applications dismissed. Thus, all applicantswill have a strong incentive <T3>not </T3>to delay the proceedings through untimely and incomplete responsesto Commission information requests. Furthermore, the final amendment deadlinesthe Commission will be issuing as required by section 15(c)(1) of the FPAwill help ensure that the relicensing process is not unduly delayed.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\325\ <T3>See </T3>Parts IV.J.2. and 3., <T3>supra.</T3>The Commission also notes that delay in the issuance of new licenses maynot be the fault of the applicants. Resource agencies may not formulaterecommended terms and conditions for licenses early in the applicationconsideration process or may have to provide the Commission with additionaldata to substantiate their positions.

O. Nonpower Licenses Section 15(f) of the FPA\326\<NOTE/> provides the Commission with the authority to issue licensesfor nonpower use upon the expiration of an existing power license. Pursuantto section 15(f), nonpower licenses are only temporary licenses which theCommission will terminate whenever it determines that a state, municipality,interstate agency, or another Federal agency is authorized and willingto assume regulatory supervision over the lands and facilities coveredby the nonpower license. Finally, pursuant to section 14(a) of the FPA,nonpower licensees must pay the existing licensee its net investment inits project and reasonable severance damages.\327\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\326\ 15 U.S.C. 808(f) (1982 and Supp. 1988). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\327\ 16 U.S.C. 807(a) (1982). In the NOPR, the Commission proposed provisions regarding the filing andprocessing of applications for nonpower license,   the termination of anonpower application proceeding, and the duration of nonpower licenses.Specifically, proposed andSection; 16.11(a) would require nonpower applicantsto include in their applications, <T3>inter alia</T3>: (1) The information required by andSection; 4.51 orandSection; 4.61 of the Commission's regulations;\328\<NOTE/> (2) a description of the proposed nonpower use; (3) a showingof how the nonpower use conforms with a comprehensive plan for the waterwayas defined in section l0(a)(1) of the FPA; and, (4) a statement identifyingthe state, municipal, interstate, or Federal agency authorized and willingto assume regulatory supervision over the lands, waterways, and facilitiesto be included within the nonpower project.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\328\ The Michigan Department and Trout Unlimited suggestthat andSection; 16.11 be revised to require nonpower applicants to providecertain environmental information about their proposals. The revision isunnecessary because andSection;andSection; 4.51 and 4.61 of the Commission'sregulations require that this information be provided. Proposed andSection; 16.11(b) would allow the Commission to terminate a nonpowerapplication proceeding in cases where the existing project is located onUnited States lands, and the Federal agency with jurisdiction over theland is able and willing to accept immediate responsibility for the nonpoweruse. Finally, proposed andSection; 16.11(c) would allow the nonpower licenseto remain in effect until either the pertinent agency assumes regulatorycontrol over the lands and facilities, or the project structures are removedand the land is restored pursuant to a plan approved by the Commission. American Rivers objects to the provision of andSection; 16.11(a) requiringidentification of the agency authorized and willing to assume regulatorysupervision over the project. It contends that identification of the regulatoryagency at the application stage is inconsistent with FPA section 15(f),since that section only requires identification of the agency at the pointwhen termination of the nonpower license will occur. American Rivers alsoobjects to andSection; 16.11(b), arguing that it would allow the Federalland management agency to take over a project subject to a nonpower licensingproceeding regardless of the amount of time and effort the nonpower applicanthas invested in the proceeding. It recommends that the provision be revisedto require the land management agency to provide notice of its intent toexercise its rights under the provision at least 24 months prior to licenseexpiration. Finally, American Rivers requests clarification regarding andSection;16.11(c), arguing that its provision allowing removal of project structuresand restoration of lands by the nonpower licensee conflicts with the requirementin andSection; 16.11(a) that a regulatory agency be identified in all cases.\329\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\329\ American Rivers also requests clarification of the referencein andSection; 16.11(a)(vii) to andSection; 16.8(d)(2). The purpose of thisprovision is to ensure that nonpower applicants have provided all agencieswhich are authorized to assume regulatory supervision over the site withcopies of their applications for nonpower license, as specified in andSection;16.8(d)(2). The purpose of section 15(f) of the FPA is to permit the operation of projectsfor nonpower purposes under Commission supervision for short periods untilan agency with regulatory  authority over the site is willing to assumeresponsibility over the lands and facilities included in the nonpower license.This is why section 15(f) specifically provides that a nonpower licenseis to be ``a temporary license.'' Thus, the Commission will issue a nonpowerlicense when it is reasonably assured that such an agency will be ableto assume regulatory control of the project lands and facilities in thenear future. The Commission, therefore, must know at the time it is consideringan application for nonpower license whether an authorized agency will bewilling to assume these responsibilities. Consequently, and contrary toAmerican Rivers' contentions, the requirement in andSection; 16.11(a) thatapplicants for nonpower licenses identify the agency that is authorizedand willing to assume regulatory responsibility over the site is entirelyconsistent with the provisions of section 15(f) of the FPA.As pointed out by American Rivers, the provisions of andSection; 16.11(c)(2)allowing nonpower licensees to terminate their licenses by removing projectstructures and restoring the land are inconsistent with the requirementof andSection; 16.11(a) for identification of a responsible agency. Therewould be no need to identify such an agency if a nonpower licensee couldterminate its license by removal without such an agency assuming regulatorycontrol. The Commission believes that section 15(f) provides for terminationof nonpower licenses only when an authorized agency is to assume regulatoryresponsibility over the site. Therefore, the Commission is revising andSection;16.11(c) to eliminate the provision allowing nonpower licensees to removeproject structures and restore project lands. The Commission does not believe it is necessary to revise andSection; 16.11(b),as suggested by American Rivers. The purpose of andSection; 16.11(b) wasto avoid the necessity of issuing a nonpower license in cases where theproject is located on Federal lands, and the relevant Federal land managementagency is willing to immediately assume regulatory responsibility for thenonpower use. While this procedure may result in an applicant's devotingresources to prepare an application for a nonpower license but not receivinga nonpower license, the same result could occur in cases where the Commissiondenies an application for a nonpower license. Furthermore, in order tofulfill the requirement of andSection; 16.11(a) to identify the agency thatwill eventually be assuming regulatory responsibility over the site, potentialnonpower applicants will have to consult with the Federal land managementagency early in the application preparation process. Thus, such applicantswill be aware of the agency's willingness to assume responsibility andthe time at which the agency would be willing to do so. Consequently, suchapplicants will have advance notice of the Federal agency's intentions.In a related matter, Brazos contends that the Commission should reviseandSection; 16.11(b) to exclude municipal applicants for nonpower licensefrom its coverage. Brazos contends that municipalities should not be subjectto having their property transferred to a Federal agency. No revision tothis section is necessary to protect municipalities' ownership rights.Section 16.11(b) only pertains to the transfer from the Commission to theFederal land management agency of regulatory responsibility over the site.It does not affect entities' property rights in project facilities.\330\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\330\ The Department of Commerce suggests that applicantsfor new licenses be required to provide the information required of applicantsfor nonpower licenses under andSection; 16.11(a) if a resource agency requeststhat the project be converted to nonpower use under a nonpower license.The Commission declines to make this revision. If a state agency wantsa site to be converted to nonpower use, it should file an application fornonpower license and prepare the information required by andSection; 16.11(a).If a Federal agency wants a site converted to nonpower use, it should filea recommendation that the United States take over the project as prescribedin section 14 of the FPA. <ITAG tagnum="28">The procedures for takeover under section 14 of the FPA were specifiedin proposed andSection;andSection; 16.14 to 16.17 of the NOPR. No significantcomments were received on these provisions. The final rule adopts the provisionsas proposed in the NOPR with minor revisions. </ITAG>P. Minor and MinorPart Licenses not Subject to Sections 14 and 15 of the Federal Power ActAs discussed previously,\331\<NOTE/> the Commission's longstanding practice has been to waivesections 14 and 15 and other applicable provisions of the FPA when it issuesminor and minor part licenses.\332\<NOTE/> Consequently, numerous licenses are not statutorily coveredby the substantive and procedural provisions of section 15 of the FPA asamended by ECPA. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\331\ <T3>See</T3> Part IV.A., <T3>supra</T3>. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\332\ As indicated before in this preamble, except for transmissionline licenses, the Commission no longer issues minor part licenses.In order to clarify the procedures it would use in processing and consideringapplications for subsequent license for projects covered by expiring minorand minor part licenses where sections 14 and 15 had been waived, the Commissionproposed in the NOPR to add a new Subpart E to its relicensing regulations.In summary, the provisions of Subpart E would: (1) Require existing licenseesof such projects to file notices of intent and make information availablein accordance with sections 15(b) (1) and (2), respectively, of the FPA;\333\<NOTE/> (2) require applicants for subsequent license to follow theconsultation requirements of andSection; 16.8; \334\<NOTE/> (3) require applicants for subsequent license to file theirapplications at least 24 months prior to the expiration of the existinglicenses, in accordance with section 15(c)(1) of the FPA; \335\<NOTE/> and (4) require applicants for subsequent license to includein their applications the information specified in andSection; 16.10.\336\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\333\ Proposed andSection; 16.19. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\334\ Proposed andSection; 16.20(c). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\335\ Proposed andSection; 16.20(b). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\336\ Proposed andSection; 16.20(c). The NOPR also proposed that applications for subsequent license be subjectto the same general processing provisions as applications for new licensefor projects subject to sections 14 and 15 of the FPA.\337\<NOTE/> However, since section 15 of the FPA is  not applicable tothese projects, the Commission indicated that the licensing proceedingfor a project with an expiring minor or minor part license where sections14 and 15 have been waived would be an original licensing proceeding undersection 4(e) of the FPA.\338\<NOTE/> Thus, the provision of section 15(a)(2) of the FPA that insignificantdifferences between competing proposals will not result in a transfer ofa project would not be applicable to applications for subsequent license.Instead, the Commission would use the standard of section 10(a)(1) of theFPA and the rules of preference applicable to original licensing proceedings,\339\<NOTE/> including the preference afforded to municipalities undersection 7(a) of the FPA, to choose between competing applicants for subsequentlicense.\340\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\337\ <T3>Id.</T3> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\338\ <T3>See</T3> NOPR preamble at 33 and proposed andSection; 16.19(b). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\339\ <T3>See</T3> 18 CFR 4.37 (1988). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\340\ Proposed andSection; 16.20(c). <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Procedures and Standards</ITAG>The majority of the commenters \341\<NOTE/> object to the Commission's proposals in the NOPR to subjectholders of minor and minor part licenses where sections 14 and 15 of theFPA have been waived, and applicants for subsequent license for these projects,to the procedural and information requirements applicable to projects subjectto section 15. They state that it would be inequitable to require ownersof, and applicants for, these small, sometime minuscule, projects to complywith the detailed and burdensome requirements applicable to larger projects.They find particularly objectionable the requirement that they file noticesof intent pursuant to section 15(c)(1) of the FPA. They contend that thisrequirement, in combination with the Commission's proposals to have section7(a) municipal preference apply to these proceedings, and to not applythe insignificant differences test of section 15(a)(2) to the proceedings,will put existing licensees of these projects in an extremely disadvantageousposition vis-a-vis competing municipal applicants. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\341\ <T3>See. e.g.</T3>, the comments of American Paper, Georgia Power, NationalHydropower, Rochester Gas, Wisconsin Power, Wisconsin Utilities and WashingtonPower. The Michigan Department supports the proposal to require applicantsfor such projects to comply with the consultation provisions of andSection;16.8. The commenters also contend that most, if not all, of the items of informationcontained in andSection; 16.10 are irrelevant to Commission evaluation oftheir small projects. They further state that requiring them to developand submit this information could lead many of them to decide not to seeksubsequent licenses for the projects. PGandamp;E objects to the applicability of municipal preference to theseproceedings. PGandamp;E contends that application of this preference wouldbe inconsistent with Congress' intent in enacting ECPA to eliminate useof the applicants' status as a decisional factor in choosing among competingapplicants at the expiration of existing licenses. In support of its position,PGandamp;E cites section 10 of ECPA,\342\<NOTE/> which established special  procedures to address nine caseswhere municipal applicants had filed applications for license in competitionwith the existing non-municipal applicants. According to PGandamp;E, Congressdid not intend municipal preference to be applicable to subsequent licensesfor minor projects where the existing licenses waive the application ofsections 14 and 15 of the FPA.\343\<NOTE/> PGandamp;E argues that this is clearly shown by Congress' inclusionof two minor licenses, where sections 14 and 15 of the FPA had been waived,\344\<NOTE/> within the coverage of ECPA section 10, together with thatsection's provision \345\<NOTE/> that the issue of whether municipal preference would be applicableto the proceedings would be based on the ultimate resolution of then ongoingcourt proceedings.\346\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\342\ <T3>See</T3> 100 Stat. 1252. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\343\ In its reply comments, Northern California Agency expressessupport for the proposition that municipal preference is applicable tothese proceedings. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\344\ Project Nos. 596 and 1061. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\345\<T3>See</T3> section 10(b) of ECPA, 100 STAT. 1253. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\346\ See Pacific Power andamp; Light Co., 25 FERC andpara; 61,052,<T3>reh'g denied</T3>, 25 FERC andpara; 61,290 (1983), <T3>rev'd en banc on other grounds sub nom.</T3> Clark-Cowlitz Joint OperatingAgency v. FERC, 826 F.2d 1074 (D.C. Cir. 1987).In section 2 of ECPA, Congress clearly restricted the municipal preferenceunder section 7 of the FPA to preliminary permits and to original licensingand made it inapplicable to relicensing proceedings. Neither the languagenor the legislative history of ECPA suggests that Congress intended toeliminate the municipal preference in the relicensing of major  projectswhile retaining it for minor ones. No such distinction appears in the languageof ECPA. Both the House and Senate reports accompanying the legislationthat was eventually enacted as ECPA explain that ECPA makes the municipalpreference ``inapplicable in proceedings following expiration of an existinglicense.''\347\<NOTE/> Congress was thus attempting to differentiate between an``original'' license (<T3>i.e.</T3>, the first license issued for a project), to which the preferencewould continue to apply, and any license issued following the expirationof an existing license, to which the preference would not apply. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\347\ H.R. Rep. No. 507, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. 10 (1986). TheSenate Committee language is similar, indicating the preference ``doesnot apply to the issuance * * * of a new license for a previously licensedhydroelectric project. S. Rep. No. 161, 99th Cong., 1st Sess. 4 (1985).The purpose of Congress was to place all applicants in a relicensing onan equal footing, to deny any applicant or class of applicants a preference,and to require the Commission to award the license to the applicant whoseproposal would best serve the public interest. These considerations applyequally to minor licenses as to major ones. Specifically, section 2 of ECPA revised the municipal preference provisionsof section 7(a) to state that the Commission was to afford municipalitiesa preference ``[i]n issuing preliminary permits hereunder or original licenseswhere no preliminary permit has been issued.'' Prior to ECPA, that sectionhad required the Commission to afford municipalities a  preference ``[i]nissuing preliminary permits hereunder or licenses where no preliminarypermit has been issued and in issuing licenses to new licensees under section15 hereof.'' This revision to section 7(a) of the FPA, together with Congress' changingof all references in section 15(a)(1) of the FPA from ``original'' licenseesor licenses to ``existing'' licensees or licenses,\348\<NOTE/> indicates that Congress was attempting to differentiate between``original'' licenses and those to be issued following the expiration ofan existing license. In light of this, and considering Congress' generalintent to eliminate the status of an applicant as a decisional factor indetermining which applicant should receive a second or third license fora project, the Commission believes that Congress intended that municipalpreference would apply only to preliminary permits and the <T3>first </T3>license issued for a project, regardless of the technicalstatus of the second or subsequent license for a project.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\348\ <T3>See </T3>section 4(b) of ECPA, 100 Stat. 1248. Moreover, there are affirmative indications that Congress expected ECPAto clarify that the municipal preference would be inapplicable to all relicensingproceedings, whether for major or minor projects. In section 10 of ECPA,Congress provided that ECPA's revision to the municipal preference provisionof section 7(a) of the FPA would not be applicable to nine listed relicensingcases, including two involving minor projects, if the   existing licenseeselected not to use the ECPA section 10 procedures. Furthermore, Congressin section 10 of ECPA provided that the amendments to the FPA made by ECPA(including the revisions to section 7(a)) would govern these nine proceedings,if the competing municipalities elected not to use the ECPA section 10procedures. These actions clearly show that Congress believed that theissue of the applicability of municipal preference at relicensing was identicalfor both major and minor licenses, and that its clarification that municipalpreference was not to apply at relicensing was to encompass both majorand minor projects. The fact that the Commission has made it a practice to waive the provisionsof section l5 of the FPA in the case of minor licenses has no bearing onthe question of municipal preference. The subsequent licensing of an expiredminor license is a relicensing for purposes of ECPA. It is not transformedinto an original licensing merely because the Commission, in a previouslicensing order, has waived the provisions of section 15 of the FPA astoo burdensome for a minor license. Further, while the Commission in thisrule is freeing minor licensees from some requirements related to section15 provisions, applicants for a subsequent minor license will be subjectto different requirements than applicants for an original license. Theywill be required, for example, to file notices of intent and to make certaininformation available in accordance with section 15(b) of the FPA; to followthe consultation process of andSection; 16.8; and to file applications atleast 24 months prior to the expiration of existing licenses. Competingapplications for minor licenses will also be evaluated by the same standardsas those applicable to major projects under regulations implementing section15 of the FPA. These provisions recognize the reality that the licensingof a minor project subsequent to the expiration of an earlier license isa relicensing. In this regard, the prior waiver of sections 14 and 15 and the relatedprovisions of the FPA previously discussed was intended to relieve minorlicensees from various burdensome requirements that are inappropriate andunnecessary in the context of minor projects. The waivers were never intendedto exclude minor licensees from the relicensing process. Relicensing isnot a burden inappropriate to a minor project; on the contrary, it is aprocess that is as applicable and necessary to minor projects as it isto major projects. Moreover, subsequent to the waiver of sections 14 and15 in those minor licenses, Congress, through ECPA, has amended section15 with respect to the relicensing process. The waivers were clearly notintended to apply to portions of a statute that were not in existence atthe time the waivers were granted. Therefore, in light of all of the above,the Commission is adding a new provision\349\<NOTE/> specifically indicating that section 7(a) of the FPA willnot be applicable to minor license proceedings.\350\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\349\ Section 16.20(b)(2). The final rule also redesignatesproposed andSection; 16.20(b) as andSection; 16.20(c), and makes minor revisionsto the text thereof. The Commission is deleting the provision (section16.19(b)) stating that applicants for subsequent license for projects withlicenses that waive sections 14 and 15 of the FPA must file applicationsfor original license pursuant to section 4(e) of the FPA. New section 16.20(b)(1)specifies that applicants must file their applications under Part I ofthe FPA. The final rule also redesignates proposed andSection; 16.19(c) and(d) as andSection; 16.19(b) and (c). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\350\ In early 1988, Commission staff, consistent with therevisions in andSection; 4.60 proposed in the NOPR (<T3>see </T3>Part IV.A., <T3>supra</T3>, began sending letters to applicants for minor license requestingthat they inform the Commission whether they wanted the provisions traditionallywaived with minor licenses (<T3>i.e.</T3>, sections 14 and 15 and others) to be waived for their licenses.Those letters also indicated that municipal preference would apply to theensuing licensing proceeding should the applicant choose to have sections14 and 15 waived. In light of our determination regarding the non-applicabilityof municipal preference, minor licensees who received such letters andelected to not seek the waiver may, if they wish, file with the Commissiona request to have the waiver apply.With the one exception discussed below, the Commission declines to exemptowners of, and applicants for, subsequent license from complying with theprocedural provisions established for major projects covered by section15 of the FPA. The Commission believes that having these provisions applyto these proceedings will eliminate potential confusion regarding filingdeadlines and processing procedures, and will result in better and moreinformed consultation with agencies. Furthermore, since the Commissionis clarifying that municipal preference will not be applicable to theseproceedings, the inequities cited by the commenters will not occur. The Commission is, however, deleting the requirement that applicants forsubsequent license provide the information specified in andSection; 16.10.As suggested by the commenters, much of this information may not be relevantto their small projects, and generically requiring the development andsubmittal of all of this information in all cases would be unduly burdensome.The Commission will seek, through additional information requests, theitems of andSection; 16.10 information it deems necessary to evaluate individualapplications. Finally, the Commission is eliminating the reference in andSection; 16.20(c)to the processing of subsequent applications in accordance with the rulesof preference of andSection; 4.37 of the Commission's regulations. Thoserules of preference, in addition to relying on municipal preference, accorddecisional significance to the first-filed application and to other factorsclearly inappropriate to these proceedings. The Commission will rely onthe standards of sections 10(a) and 15(a) of the FPA in evaluating applications.In minor licensing cases where competing applications are filed, the Commissionwill apply the same tests as for major licenses, after requesting fromthe competing applicants the information it deems necessary to evaluatethe factors set out in section 15(a) (2) and (3).<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Transition Provisions  </ITAG>In the NOPR, the Commission proposed certain transition provisions regardingthe application of the section 15 procedures to minor licenses where sections14 and 15 had been waived.\351\<NOTE/>  In response to concerns raised by the commenters, the Commissionis updating the transition provisions,\352\<NOTE/> and specifying that holders of existing minor licenses donot have to make available information required by andSection; 16.7 if theyhave already filed their applications.\353\<NOTE/>   <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\351\ <T3>See </T3>proposed andSection; 16.19(c) (3) and (4) and andSection; 16.20(b)(2) and (3). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\352\ <T3>See </T3>andSection; 16.19(b) (3) and (4) and andSection; 16.20(c) (2)and (3). Specifically, andSection; 16.19(b)(3) provides that licensees withlicenses expiring before October 17, 1994, must file notices of intentwith the Commission no later than 60 days after the effective date of thisrule, while andSection; 16.19(b)(4) provides that new notices of intent arenot required of applicants that filed such notices or their applicationsprior to the effective date of this rule. Section 16.20(c) (2) and (3)provide that applications for subsequent license for minor projects withlicenses that will expire within four years of the effective date of thisrule must be filed at least 12 months before the expiration date of theexisting license. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\353\ <T3>See </T3>andSection; 16.19(c)(2). Holyoke expresses concern that it wouldbe required to repeat consultation with resource agencies pursuant to andSection;16.8 even though it had already filed its applications. However, andSection;16.8(i)(1) specifically indicates that such reconsultation would not berequired.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Continued Operation of Minor Projects </ITAG>As discussed previously,\354\<NOTE/> the Commission's authority and obligation to issue annuallicenses to existing licensees in cases where the relicensing proceedingsare not completed prior  to the expiration of the existing licenses isderived from section 15(a) of the FPA. Since minor licenses in most caseswaive the applicability of sections 14 and 15 of the FPA, the Commissionhas no authority to issue annual licenses for these minor licenses. However,pursuant to the provisions of section 9(b) of the Administrative ProcedureAct (APA),\355\<NOTE/> when a licensee has made a timely and sufficient applicationfor a renewal of license, the existing license is deemed not to expireuntil the application has been finally acted upon by the agency. Consequently,if, prior to the end of the term of the existing license, the Commissionhas not acted on an application for subsequent license filed by the holderof a minor license where sections 14 and 15 of the FPA have been waived,then the existing licensee can continue to operate the project until theCommission acts. Paragraph (a) of andSection; 16.21 codifies this principle.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\354\ <T3>See </T3>Part IV.N., <T3>supra.</T3><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\355\ 5 U.S.C. 558(c) (1982).The ability of an existing minor licensee to continue to operate its projectafter the term of its license under section 9(b) of the APA is contingentupon the filing of a renewal application by the existing licensee. If suchan application is not filed, the existing minor licensee has no expressauthority to continue to operate its project. However, this could resultin a hiatus in the operation of, and direct user responsibility over, projectsin cases where a third party, but not the existing licensee, files an applicationfor subsequent license, and the  Commission is unable to complete processingof the third party's application prior to the expiration of the existinglicense. In order to avoid this, the Commission proposed, in andSection;16.21(b), to issue orders to allow existing licensees to continue to operatetheir projects after expiration. Washington Wildlife suggests that the Commission revise andSection; 16.21to make clear that continued operation of these projects would be underthe terms and conditions of the existing license. It also suggests thatthe Commission specify that it will be requiring existing licensees toimplement resource mitigation measures during the period following expirationof the existing licenses. The Department of Commerce objects to andSection;16.21(b), contending that the Commission does not have the authority toallow operation of projects after expiration of their licenses in caseswhere the existing licensees do not file renewal applications. The suggestion of Washington Wildlife, to clarify that operation of theseprojects will be under the terms and conditions of existing licenses, isappropriate, and the Commission is making the necessary changes to andSection;16.21. However, the Commission declines to make the other revision suggestedby Washington Wildlife. With regard to projects covered by andSection; 16.21(a),it appears that section 9(b) of the APA contemplates that the operationof projects following expiration of existing licenses will be under theterms and conditions of the existing license. Thus, as in the case of annuallicenses under section 15(a)(1) of the FPA, the Commission cannot imposeadditional mitigation requirements unless it had reserved to itself theauthority to do so in the existing license. As to projects covered by andSection;16.21(b), while the Commission would not be constrained by the operationof section 9(b) of the APA, it is doubtful that the Commission would havethe substantial evidence to support any such requirements.\356\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\356\ <T3>See </T3>Part IV.N., <T3>supra</T3>, for further discussion of this issue. Contrary to the contentions of the Department of Commerce, the Commissionbelieves it has the authority to require existing licensees to continueto operate their projects following expiration, as specified in andSection;16.21(b). As discussed previously, the purpose of this provision was torequire existing licensees to continue to operate their projects untilthe Commission could act on any application for the site filed by a thirdparty.\357\<NOTE/> This will permit the Commission to ensure that the safetyand environmental provisions of the existing license will continue untilthe Commission acts on a competing application, or takes other appropriateaction regarding termination of the existing licensee's presence at thesite. The Commission believes that its authority in this regard clearlyfalls within the scope of section 309 of the FPA,\358\<NOTE/> which provides the Commission with the authority ``to prescribe,issue, make, amend, and rescind such orders, rules, and regulations asit may find necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions'' of theFPA. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\357\ As proposed in the NOPR, andSection; 16.21(b) used theword ``allowing''; however, the intent of the provision was to give theCommission the authority to ``require'' continued operation. Section 16.21(b)is being revised accordingly. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\358\ 16 U.S.C. andSection; 825h (1982).  <ITAG tagnum="81">Q. Exemptions </ITAG>Current Commission regulations state that the Commission will accept anexemption application for a project currently under license, but only ifthe exemption applicant is the licensee.\359\<NOTE/> Accordingly, in the NOPR the Commission specified the requirementsregarding the filing of exemption applications by existing licensees ofprojects with licenses subject to sections 14 and 15 of the FPA (andSection;16.12), and by existing licensees of projects with minor licenses not subjectto sections l4 and 15 of the FPA (andSection; 16.22). These regulations wouldsubject existing licensees intending to file exemption applications tothe same provisions applicable to applicants for new license regardingnotices of intent, access, consultation, application filing deadlines,providing of information, and Commission processing of the applications.\360\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\359\ <T3>See </T3>18 CFR 4.33(d)(ii) (1988). Commission regulations providefor two types of exemptions from licensing: for a small hydroelectric powerproject of five megawatts or less (governed by 18 CFR Part 4 Subpart K(1988)), and for a small conduit hydroelectric facility (governed by 18CFR Part 4 Subpart L (1988)). An existing licensee filing an exemptionapplication must comply with the provisions of Subpart K or L, as appropriate.In the case of five megawatt exemptions, the existing licensee must proposeto increase the generating capacity of its project. <T3>See </T3>18 CFR 4.30(b)(12) (1988). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\360\ <T3>See </T3>andSection; 16.12 (b) and (c) and andSection; 16.22(b).The Small Business Administration objects to making exemption applicantsfollow the same procedures applicable to applicants for new license, statingthat existing consultation and filing provisions are adequate. The Commissionbelieves, however, that, in order to eliminate confusion and to be consistentwith the scheme of regulation established by ECPA, the same proceduralrequirements should be followed by all applicants. However, the Commissionis revising andSection; 16.22 to eliminate the requirement that existinglicensees having minor licenses not subject to sections 14 and 15 of theFPA, provide the information specified in andSection; 16.10 when filing exemptionapplications. R. Prohibitions Against Filing Applications and Additional Procedures In the NOPR, the Commission proposed that an existing licensee who informedthe Commission in its FPA section 15(b)(1) notice of intent that it didnot intend to file an application would be prohibited from filing an applicationfor new license.\361\<NOTE/> In addition, the Commission proposed to prohibit an existinglicensee from filing an application if it failed to do so by the 24-monthfiling deadline established by section 15(c)(1) of the FPA.\362\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\361\ Proposed andSection; 16.23(a). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\362\ Proposed andSection; 16.23(b). The Commission also proposed in the NOPR that, if an existing licenseeinformed the Commission in its FPA section   15(b)(1) notice of intentthat it would file an application, but failed to do so, and no other applicationswere filed, or if all timely filed applications were subsequently rejectedor dismissed pursuant to andSection; 4.32,\363\<NOTE/> the Commission would issue a public notice soliciting applicationsfrom potential applicants other than the existing licensee.\364\<NOTE/> If one or more notices of intent to file an application werefiled with the Commission within 90 days of the notice, the applicantsfiling the notices of intent could, within 18 months from the dates theirnotices of intent were filed with the Commission, file applications forlicense for their projects pursuant to section 4(e) of the FPA.\365\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\363\ Pursuant to andSection; 16.9(b)(4), an application rejectedor dismissed pursuant to andSection; 4.32 cannot be refiled after the 24-monthnew license application filing deadline. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\364\ Proposed andSection; 16.24(a). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\365\ Proposed andSection; 16.24(b)(1). Existing licensees would be required to file, for the Director's approval,a schedule for the filing of a surrender application.\366\<NOTE/> The schedule must be filed either: (1) After the due datefor filing notices of intent established in the andSection; 16.24(a) notice,in cases where no notices of intent were filed;\367\<NOTE/> or (2) after the due date for applications, in cases wherenotices of intent were filed but no follow-up license    applications werefiled.\368\<NOTE/> Finally, after the 24-month filing deadline, existing licenseeswould be required to file, for the Director's approval, a schedule forthe filing of a surrender application, if they indicated in their FPA section15(b)(1) notices of intent that they did not intend to file, and no applicationswere in fact filed.\369\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\366\ The requirements regarding the content of applicationsfor surrender are embodied in 18 CFR Part 6 (1988). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\367\ Proposed andSection; 16.24(c)(2). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\368\ Proposed andSection; 16.24(c)(3). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\369\ Proposed andSection; 16.24(c)(1). The Commission indicated, however, that in cases where an existing licenseestated in its section 15(b)(1) notice of intent that it intended not tofile an application, and no notices of intent or applications were filedpursuant to andSection; 16.24(b), the Commission was contemplating offeringan existing licensee one last opportunity to choose between applying tosurrender its project and applying for a license to continue to operatethe project.\370\<NOTE/> Therefore, it solicited comments on the most appropriateapproach to this situation.\371\<NOTE/> The Commission also solicited comments on the appropriatetreatment of an application filed in response to a notice issued underandSection; 16.24(a) by a combined entity consisting of an existing licenseethat failed to file a timely application and another venturer.\372\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\370\ <T3>See </T3>NOPR preamble at 7. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\371\ <T3>See </T3>NOPR preamble at 8. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\372\ <T3>See </T3>NOPR preamble at 7.The Small Business Administration supports the provisions of andSection;16.23 (a) and (b). However, it suggests that the section be revised tostate that existing licensees failing to timely file notices of intentpursuant to section 15(b)(1) of the FPA be prohibited from filing licenseapplications.\373\<NOTE/> It also argues that, in cases where existing licensees indicatein their section 15(b)(1) notices of intent that they are not going tofile, and no applications are timely filed, then existing licensees shouldhave a final opportunity to maintain possession of their projects.\374\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\373\ A similar suggestion was made by Rochester Gas. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\374\ The Small Business Administration contends that theCommission can address this problem by requesting existing licensees tofile applications for annual license pursuant to section 15(a)(1) of theFPA. Although it is not entirely clear on this point, it appears to arguethat, if the existing licensee files an application for annual licenseand the Commission grants such an annual license, the existing licenseewould continue to operate its project indefinitely under annual license.<ITAG tagnum="28">As discussed previously (</ITAG><T3>see </T3>Part IV.N., <T3>supra</T3>), annual licenses are granted automatically; no applicationis required on the part of the existing licensee. Also, an annual licensewill continue only until either the Commission grants a new license, Federaltakeover occurs, or the existing licensee vacates the site pursuant toCommission order. Perpetual annual licenses are not authorized. <T3>See </T3>La Courte Oreilles Band v. FPC, 510 F.2d 198, 209-10 (D.C.Cir. 1975) .  New York Electric states that, if the Commission adopts the NOPR proposalnot to treat those existing licensees that file applications jointly witha third party as existing licensees, it should revise the negative noticeof intent provisions of   andSection; 16.23(a) to allow an existing licenseefiling a negative notice of intent, to file a timely application in conjunctionwith another entity. American Rivers supports the provisions of andSection; 16.24. It also statesthat it has no objection to existing licensees filing applications in conjunctionwith third parties in response to a andSection; 16.24(a) notice, as longas the existing licensee is not permitted to enjoy the advantages of incumbency.In addition, it states that it can see no reason why an existing licenseeshould not be allowed to apply for an original license when no other applicationsare timely filed pursuant to the andSection; 16.24(b) procedures. However,American Rivers states that existing licensees should be afforded thisright only if they file notices of intent pursuant to andSection; 16.24(b),and that those failing to do so should be required to file applicationsfor surrender. Finally, it suggests that the regulations be revised toclarify that existing licensees will be required to file applications forsurrender when the Commission determines that no new license should beissued for a project. Wildlife Federation contends that existing licensees should be providedwith an opportunity to file either original applications for license orsurrender applications in cases where no other entity expresses an interestin a site by filing notices of intent and license applications pursuantto the andSection; 16.24(b) procedures. However, Wildlife Federation arguesthat the Commission should state a presumption in favor of requiring existinglicensees to file for surrender in such cases.\375\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\375\ Wildlife Federation also suggests that the Commissionrevise the proposed regulations to require existing licensees to file applicationseither for surrender or conversion to a nonpower license in cases wherethe Commission determines that it should not issue a power license fora project. Also, it contends that the regulations governing applicationsfor nonpower license (andSection; 16.11) should be revised to indicate thatnongovernmental entities can apply for and obtain nonpower licenses. <ITAG tagnum="28">The annual license provisions of section 15(a)(1) of the FPA, whichare discussed in Part IV.N., </ITAG><T3>supra, </T3>do not provide the Commission with the authority to requireexisting licensees to apply for, and continue to operate their projectsinvoluntarily under, nonpower licenses. Consequently, the Commission declinesto make the revision. Also, there is no need to revise andSection; 16.11as suggested by it, since andSection; 16.11 does not limit those who canfile applications for nonpower license to governmental entities; any entity,including an existing licensee or a private third party, can file an applicationfor nonpower license under section 15(a)(1) of the FPA as implemented byandSection; 16.11.  Long Lake contends that the Commission generally should not permit an existinglicensee that indicated in its section 15(b)(1) notice of intent that itwould file an application, but does not in fact do so, to file a jointapplication with another venturer. However, it suggests that it might beappropriate to allow a joint application to be filed when no other applicationsare filed after notice soliciting such other applications is issued, andwhen it would be in the public interest to allow a project to continueto be operated under license. Long Lake also contends that an existinglicensee should be required to file an application for surrender and dismantleits project when it    states in its sections 15(b)(1) notice that it doesnot intend to file an application, and no other entity files an application.Rochester Gas and the Wisconsin Department state that an existing licenseeshould be provided with an opportunity to file a license application, insteadof an application for surrender, in cases where no other applications arefiled. The Department of Commerce and the Michigan Department contend thatexisting licensees should not be provided with this opportunity. Finally,Washington Wildlife contends that, if no new license is issued for a projectbecause either no application is filed or the Commission determines thatno new license should be granted, the existing licensee, at the requestof the resource agencies, should be required to remove project structures.As recommended by the Small Business Administration and Rochester Gas,and consistent with ECPA's legislative history,\376\<NOTE/> the Commission is adding a new section \377\<NOTE/> specifying that the failure of an existing licensee to filea timely section 15(b)(1) notice of intent will be deemed a negative noticeof intent. As discussed below, this will    prohibit the existing licenseefrom filing an application for the site.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\376\ <T3>See </T3>H.R. Rep. No. 99-507, 99th Cong. 2nd Sess. 36 (1986): <ITAG tagnum="28">Failure to meet the [section 15(b)(1) and (c)(1)] deadlines must prejudicethe affected entity.

The provisions of proposed andSection;16.23 are now embodied in andSection; 16.24.The Commission is retaining the provisions of proposed andSection; 16.23(redesignated andSection; 16.24 by this final rule \378\<NOTE/>), prohibiting existing licensees that file negative section15(b)(1) notices of intent from filing applications, and prohibiting thefiling of applications after the new application filing deadline. Existinglicensees should ascertain in a timely manner whether they intend to file.A negative notice of intent could mislead potential competitors. Therefore,the prohibition on filing applications in these circumstances is appropriate.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\378\ In order to reflect the differing transition filingdeadlines for applications for projects with licenses subject to sections14 and 15 of the FPA and for those that are not, the text of andSection;16.24 is divided into two subsections covering the two situations. As to the prohibition on untimely applications by existing licensees, theCommission believes that the legislative history of ECPA \379\<NOTE/> requires retention of this provision. Also, as discussedpreviously,\380\<NOTE/> the Commission is retaining the proposed provision specifyingthat existing licensees filing joint applications with third parties wouldnot be considered existing licensees for purposes of the insignificantdifferences provision of section 15(a)(2). Despite this, the Commissiondoes not believe there is any need to create special processing or re-applicationprovisions for such joint applicants, and declines to adopt those suggestions.The Commission is clarifying that the various prohibitions on the filingof applications by existing licensees apply whether the existing licenseeis acting individually or in conjunction with an entity or entities thatare not currently licensees of the project.\381\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\379\ <T3>See </T3>discussion, <T3>supra. </T3><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\380\ <T3>See </T3>Part IV.M., <T3>supra.</T3><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\381\ <T3>See </T3>andSection;andSection; 16.24 (a) (1) and (2), (b) (1) and (2),and 16.25(a). The Commission is also retaining the provisions of proposed andSection; 16.24(redesignated andSection; 16.25 by this final rule) regarding the solicitationof applications for license from potential applicants other than the existinglicensee, in cases where an existing licensee indicates in its section15(b)(1) notice that it intends to file, and no other applications arefiled by the new application filing deadline. The Commission believes thatthis provision is necessary to provide an opportunity to compete for theproject site for entities that decide not to file applications becauseof an existing licensee's positive notice of intent. The Commission declinesto revise the provision to permit an existing licensee to reenter the competition,since it believes that existing licensees should not be able to competeafter having misled other potential applicants. The Commission is adding a new andSection; 16.26 to address the situationwhere no applications are timely filed for the project after an existinglicensee states in its section 15(b)(1) notice of intent that it does notintend to file an application. This   section specifies that the Director,following the expiration of the new application filing deadline, will providethe existing licensee with written notice of the fact that no timely applicationsfor the project have been filed. The existing licensee will then be requiredto file, within 90 days of the notice, for the Director's approval, a schedulefor the filing of a surrender application for the project. The existinglicensee, as in the case where no notices of intent or applications arefiled in situations covered by andSection; 16.25, will then be required tofile its surrender application under the approved schedule and vacate thesite in accordance with Commission directions. The situation addressed by andSection; 16.26 does not involve any misleadingactions on the part of the existing licensee. However, and contrary tosome of the commenters' suggestions, the Commission believes that in thissituation, where no entity expresses an interest in continuing to operatea project, the relicensing process should terminate with no entity, includingthe existing licensee, having been afforded an additional opportunity toobtain a new license for the site. Allowing additional opportunities tofile applications would be contrary to ECPA's mandate of expedition, andcould prolong the process for years. Once the license expires or the surrenderprocess is complete, the site would be open for development under applicationsfor license filed pursuant to section 4(e) of the FPA.The Commission declines to adopt the various suggestions made by the commentersregarding surrender applications. The revision suggested by American Rivers,to clarify that applications for surrender will be required in cases wherethe Commission determines no license should issue, is unnecessary. TheCommission clearly has the authority to require applications for surrenderin such cases, and will exercise this authorization whenever it determinesthat no application for a new or subsequent power license should be issued.Washington Wildlife's suggestion, that resource agencies be provided withthe authority to require an existing licensee to remove its project incases where no new or subsequent license is to be issued, is inappropriate.As discussed previously, existing licensees will be required to file applicationsfor surrender in these situations. Since the existing licensees are requiredto consult with resource agencies pursuant to andSection; 16.8 in preparingthese applications,\382\<NOTE/> the resource agencies will be able to make their views knownregarding the most appropriate means for an existing licensee to vacatea site. However, the authority to determine the conditions governing anexisting licensee's leaving a site at the expiration of its license, includingany conditions regarding the extent and timing of an existing licensee'sobligation to remove project facilities and restore the site, resides exclusivelywith the Commission.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\382\ <T3>See </T3>andSection;andSection; 16.25(d) and 16.26(c). In many cases, existing licenses specify by way of license articles anexisting licensee's obligation to file an application for surrender andto comply with Commission orders regarding vacating the site. However,even when an existing license is silent as to these issues, the Commissionretains the authority to determine the process an existing licensee willfollow in providing the Commission with the information it needs to determinehow a project site will be vacated, and the actual conditions governingan existing licensee's vacation of a site. The Commission's authority inthis regard is derived from its general authority under section 309 ofthe FPA to issue orders necessary and appropriate to carry out the provisionsof the FPA, and its authority under section 10(c) of the FPA \383\<NOTE/> to prescribe rules and regulations necessary to protect life,health, and property. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\383\ 16 U.S.C. 803(c) (1982). The Commission's authority under these provisions of the FPA is broad,\384\<NOTE/> and permits the Commission to take any reasonable actionunder the FPA necessary to regulate in the public interest all aspectsof hydroelectric use of the nation's waters. Thus, the Commission can requirean existing licensee to file an application for surrender, and comply withCommission orders regarding removal of project structures, even in caseswhere an existing minor licensee not filing an application for subsequentlicense proposes to cease, at the expiration of its license, the jurisdictionalactivity that initially required it to obtain a license.\385\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\384\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation v. FPC, 379 F.2d 153(D.C. Cir. 1967).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\385\ One of the purposes of andSection; 16.21(b) is to clarify,for holders of existing minor licenses that do not file applications forsubsequent license, that the Commission has the authority to require themto continue operating their projects after expiration, if necessary forthe Commission to determine the conditions governing the minor licensee'svacation of the site. S. Miscellaneous  As discussed previously, applicants for new or subsequent license are requiredto comply with, <T3>inter alia, </T3>the Commission's regulations governing the contentof applications (18 CFR andSection;andSection;4.41, 4.51, or 4.61 (1988), asappropriate).\386\<NOTE/> A few commenters \387\<NOTE/> suggest that the Commission create ``stand-alone'' relicensingregulations that would contain all provisions applicable to relicense applicationsand proceedings and would not reference back to the Part 4 regulations.They contend this is necessary to eliminate confusion.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\386\ <T3>See </T3>andSection; 16.9(b)(2) and andSection; 16.20(d) (referring toandSection; 16.9(b)(2)). Sections 4.41, 4.51, and 4.61 deal with, respectively,license applications for major unconstructed and major modified projects;major projects involving an existing dam with a total installed capacityof more than five megawatts; and minor water power projects and major waterpower projects with a total installed capacity of five megawatts or less.The use of the word ``appropriate'' in andSection; 16.9(b)(2) means thatapplicants must conform their applications to the section that governstheir projects (<T3>i.e., </T3>either andSection; 4.41, andSection; 4.51, or andSection; 4. 61),not pick and choose among the various provisions of these three sectionsas they deem appropriate. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\387\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>the comments of National Hydropower and PGandamp;E.The incorporation into the Part 16 regulations and possible revision ofandSection;andSection; 4.41, 4.51, and 4.61 would be a significant and unnecessaryundertaking. The Commission believes its clarification of such issues asthe location in applications of the andSection; 16.10 information, and potentialapplicants' responsibilities regarding the collection of ``baseline'' data,will eliminate much of the confusion referenced by the commenters. Potentialapplicants with questions regarding the applicability of specific provisionsof the Part 4 regulations can, and are encouraged to, contact Commissionstaff to obtain any needed clarification. <ITAG tagnum="84">V. Regulatory Flexibility Certification  </ITAG>The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA)\388\<NOTE/> generally requires a description and analysis of final rulesthat will have significant economic impact on a substantial number of smallentities.\389\<NOTE/> Pursuant to section 605(b) of the RFA, the Commission herebycertifies that the proposed relicensing regulations, if promulgated, willnot have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of smallentities, and that, even if the rule were to have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities, it would be to theirbenefit. The Commission believes that most of the entities affected bythe rule do not fall within RFA's definition of ``small entity.'' Evenif the rule would have a significant effect on a substantial number ofsmall entities, however, application requirements proposed in this ruleare necessary for the Commission to grant a new or subsequent license toan applicant at the expiration of an existing license term. Any applicantmay benefit substantially by obtaining a license. The notice and informationrequirements for licensees are mandated by statute.\390\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\388\ 5 U.S.C. 601-612 (1982).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\389\ Section 601(c) of the RFA defines a ``small entity''as a small business, a small not-for-profit enterprise, or a small governmentaljurisdiction. A ``small business'' is defined by reference to Section 3of the Small Business Act as an enterprise which is ``independently ownedand operated and which is not dominant in its field of operation.'' 15U.S.C. 632(a) (1982). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\390\ Comments were received from the Small Business Administration.The Commission's response to these comments is found in Part IV of thispreamble. <ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Paperwork Reduction Act Statement </ITAG>The Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA)\391\<NOTE/> and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) regulations\392\<NOTE/> require the OMB to approve certain information collectionrequirements imposed by agency rule. The information collection requirementsin this final rule are contained in FERC-500, Application for License forWater Power Projects With More Than 5 MW Capacity, and FERC-505, Applicationfor License for Water Power Projects 5 MW or Less. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\391\ 44 U.S.C. 3501-3520 (1982). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\392\ 5 CFR 1320.21(a)(2) (1988). Part I of the FPA gives the Commission jurisdiction over the licensingof hydropower projects. The amendments to section 15 of the FPA made byECPA mandate that the Commission consider   additional factors in grantinga new license (relicense) and establish new procedures for filing an applicationfor a new license. A number of hydropower projects are expected to applyfor license renewal in the near future. Owners and operators of hydropower projects subject to these rules arethe likely respondents. Applications for licenses for water power projectshaving more than a 5 MW capacity (FERC-500) are estimated to have a totalannual reporting time of 40,768 hours. The estimated number of respondentsis 49; the frequency of response per year is one; and the estimated averagenumber of hours per response is 832. Applications for licenses for a waterpower project having a capacity of 5 MW or less (FERC-505) are estimatedto have a total annual reporting time of 12,460 hours. The number of respondentsper year is estimated to be 70; the frequency of response per year is estimatedto be one, and the estimated average number of hours per response is 178.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII. National Environmental Policy Act Statement </ITAG>Commission regulations require that an environmental assessment or an environmentalimpact statement (EIS) be prepared for any Commission action that may havea significant adverse effect on the human environment.\393\<NOTE/> The Commission has categorically excluded certain actionsfrom this requirement as not having a significant effect on the human environment.\394\<NOTE/>    No environmental consideration is necessary for the promulgationof a rule that is clarifying, corrective, or procedural, or that does notsubstantially change the effect of legislation or regulations being amended.\395\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\393\ Regulations Implementing National Environmental PolicyAct, 52 Fed. Reg. 47897 (Dec. 17, 1987), codified at 18 CFR Part 380. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\394\ <T3>See </T3>18 CFR 380.4 (1988). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\395\ <T3>See </T3>18 CFR 380.4(a)(2)(ii) (1988).This final rule is procedural in nature. It proposes certain informationthat must be included with an application. Thus, no environmental assessmentor environmental impact statement is necessary for the requirements proposedin this rule. The Department of Commerce asserts that these proposed regulations ``providenew requirements which will impair collection of adequate information regardingenvironmental effects, restrict the abilities of agencies to consult withapplicants compared with current practice, and fail to establish standardsfor Commission action consistent with the Electric Consumers ProtectionAct (ECPA) and other law.'' The Department of Commerce then concludes,without further argument or amplification, that an EIS must be preparedbecause the regulations are not procedural in nature but constitute a substantivechange. The Commission disagrees. The final rule revises the procedures that govern relicensing of hydroelectricpower projects subject to sections 14 and 15 of the FPA. Contrary to thesuggestions of Commerce, the rule does not substantially change existingCommission    regulations providing for pre-filing consultation with allappropriate agencies. The affected projects have been in existence fordecades. The regulations do not authorize the construction or operationof any project, but merely determine the procedures by which such constructionor operation will be considered on a case-by-case basis in future proceedings.Accordingly, the Commission concludes that these procedural rules willnot have any significant adverse effects on the quality of the human environmentsuch as to require the preparation of an EIS. <ITAG tagnum="84">VII.

Wisconsin Utilities Association (Wisconsin Utilities)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">TRABANDT, Commissioner Concurring in Part and Dissenting in Part </ITAG>There are six issues contained in this Final Rule that deserve furthercomment. These issues are: (1) The Commission decision to promulgate asection 10(j) rule that would include procedures for implementing sections4(e), 18, and 10(j) (that would include Indian Tribe participation in the10(j) process); (2) the impact of joint applications on existing licenseestatus; (3) interlocutory appeals in the dispute resolution process; (4)applicability of section 4(e) to relicensing proceedings; (5) applicabilityof section 18 to relicensing proceedings; and (6) public participationduring the pre-filing consultation process. I reluctantly concur with the resolution of the first issue. The secondissue is included in this opinion so that I can highlight an importantdiscussion contained in the Final Rule concerning acceptable options forfinancing projects. The remaining issues listed above were either not adequatelyresolved or incorrectly resolved causing me to dissent. I concur with allother issues contained in the Final Rule. 1. The Upcoming Section 10(j) Rulemaking In Order No. 511 issued February 17, 1989, the Commission made public itsinstruction to staff to prepare a NOPR on the conflict resolution proceduresprescribed by section 10(j). I submitted a concurring opinion wherein Imade clear my view that current Commission practice: (1) Is completelyconsistent with the legislative history of the Conference Report enactedby Congress; and (2) implements dispute resolution in an effective andefficient manner for the mutual benefit of license applicants and fishand wildlife resources. I would also note my dissenting opinion in <T3>Henwood Associates, Inc.</T3>, Project No. 8142, issued May 2, 1989.In <T3>Henwood</T3>, the majority concluded that the Commission's existingsection 10(j) procedures have been flawed, despite a spirited Commissiondefense of those procedures in a January 13, 1989, letter to Chairman Dingell.The majority held that the Director of OHL in his letter to a state agencydid not use precise enough language to inform that agency that the conflictto be resolved rested on the unacceptable impact on project viability whichwould trigger the statutory dispute resolution process of section 10(j),rather than merely on the inconsistencies between the recommendations ofthe state agency and those of the staff. Consequently, the majority foundthe entire section 10(j) negotiation to be fatally flawed. In essence,the majority adopted a formal expansion of section 10(j) before the Commissionhad the benefit of comments in response to the upcoming NOPR.What makes this upcoming NOPR even more troublesome is that it now willcontain procedures for the implementation of other sections contained inthe Federal Power Act, notably sections 4(e) and 18. Inasmuch as theseprocedures will apply to relicensing proceedings, I question why they arenot included in the instant Final Rule. There may be some arguable justificationfor foregoing such action at this juncture (<T3>e.g. </T3>further delay as a result of notice problems possibly requiringthe issuance of another NOPR) because of the pressing need to get somerelicensing rules out in order to accommodate many current relicense applicantswhose licenses are about to expire. But, from a programmatic perspective,it appears at least to me well worth the effort to implement all relicensingprocedures at the same time to avoid any confusion as to what course ofaction is appropriate under each provision of the FPA applicable to relicensing.Put another way, of what particular value is the pre-filing consultationprocess adopted here with all the new requirements for applicants, resourceagencies and the Commission staff, if we haven't decided yet how to implementin relicensing the statutory requirements under sections 4(e), 10(j) and18. Those statutory obligations, as a practical matter, are the substantive``guts'' of the relicensing process with regard to critical resource issuesand the Commission's fundamental responsibility to give ``equal consideration''to all resource values. The absence of those sectional implementing proceduresin this rule, in my judgment, leaves a large hole in the Final Rule. Becauseof that conclusion, two things become essential for the subsequent 10(j)rulemaking. First, the Commission must act promptly to issue the Noticeof Proposed Rulemaking to fill that hole. And, second, the Final Rule inthat separate proceeding must be as consistent and complementary in substanceand procedure as possible to avoid unnecessarily complicating or settingback the entire relicensing process. Finally, in light of the unfortunate results associated with the originaldecision to do a section 10(j) rulemaking and the subsequent decision inthe <T3>Henwood </T3>case, I have serious concerns about the likely directionof the forthcoming Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and the distinct possibilitythat the end result will be <T3>de facto</T3> mandatory conditioning for resource agencies across thespectrum of sections 4(e), 10(j) and 18, and even conceivably in otheraspects of this Final Rule. I believe the Commission invites exactly thatpossibility with this bifurcated rulemaking approach, the all-or-nothingdynamics of the 10(j) rulemaking, and the probably inevitable ``regulatorygamesmanship'' that will be forced to occur, as occurred in <T3>Henwood.</T3> Consequently, all interested parties on rehearing shouldclearly be on notice of these potentialities. 2. Impact of Joint Applications on Existing Licensee Status As the Final Rule points out, the majority of commenters on this issueoppose the Commission's policy of not considering an incumbent to be anexisting licensee for purposes of section 15 of the FPA and the Commission'srelicensing regulations if the licensee files an application for a newlicense in conjunction with another entity or entities that are not currentlicensees of the project. These commenters provided much food for thought.My colleagues and I struggled mightily in an effort to determine how bestto resolve this issue. In that effort, we reviewed four separate options and a series of sub-options,before reaching our conclusion. Those options included: 1. Consider joint applicants to be existing licensees if there are no adverseimpacts to existing customers in terms of power availability and costs.This is the option used in the March 17 draft, with minor revisions. 2. Consider joint applicants to be existing licensees if the existing licenseeretains a specified percentage ownership in project facilities, such asthe QF 50% rule. 3. Consider joint applicants to be existing licensees if the existing licenseewill receive the majority of the benefits of the project, using the streamof benefits test developed for QF proceedings. 4. State that joint applicants will not be considered existing licenseesunder any circumstances.On balance, it appears the best course of action is the one proposed inthe Final Rule which essentially affirms what the NOPR proposed. However,I wish to highlight the discussion contained on pages 204 and 205 of theslip opinion. Financial arrangements between existing licensees and thirdparties that may ultimately benefit the customers of the existing licenseecan be entered into without the need to add the third party as a co-applicant.As long as the existing licensee will retain sufficient ownership and control,a third party financier will not have to be added to an existing licensee'sapplication for new license and the existing licensee will not be jeopardizingits status as an existing licensee under section 15(a)(2). In the interestof future certainty and predictability, interested parties may wish toseek further clarification as to the types of financial transactions, aswell as any particular formulations of financial interest, that would beacceptable to the Commission. 3. Interlocutory Appeals in the Dispute Resolution Process Although I appreciate and fully understand the arguments made by my colleagueswith respect to the advisory nature of the Director's decisions in thedispute resolution process, I firmly believe that the Director's decisionswill be <T3>de facto </T3>binding on the applicants. The Final Rule denies therequest of several parties that we provide some form of appeal processas a result, even though the majority acknowledges that this could be aserious matter in some cases (slip op. at p. 83). A decision by the Director affirming the need for a particular study requestedby an appropriate agency could have the effect of forcing an existing licenseeto stop pursuing its application for new license because of the significantcost of conducting and completing such a study. The fact that the finalregulations permit an applicant to ignore the Director's decision and filean application without the study does not assuage my concern. If the applicantchooses to submit an application without the study, the applicant riskshaving its application dismissed as patently deficient by the Director.Only then does the applicant have the opportunity to seek an appeal beforethe Commission. Meanwhile, the applicant would have committed tens of thousandsof dollars to the further processing of its application, money that mightnot have been spent had the applicant been apprised by the Commission asto its views on the matter. In the alternative, if the applicant knew in pre-consultation that theCommission would be unyielding in requiring the study, the applicant couldproceed in an expeditious manner to initiate the study or consider otheroptions. Accordingly, in those instances where the need for a study isin question such that an applicant submits the matter to the Director forresolution pursuant to the dispute resolution process articulated in theFinal Rule, I believe the applicant should have the right to appeal onan interlocutory basis, but with streamlined procedures, directly to theFull Commission. Such an appeal should be handled in an expeditious manner.I note that I am not persuaded that my position on an interlocutory appealprocess for the applicant leads <T3>ipso facto </T3>to the inevitable conclusion that there must be publicparticipation in the pre-filing consultation process. I view those twoissues as wholly separate and unrelated, because the general public andthe applicant stand in two completely different postures at that pointin the overall relicensing process, including the later formal proceedingstriggered once an application is filed with the Commission. The generalpublic will have full participation <T3>and </T3>effective remedies on any resource issue after the applicationis filed and, thus, is not bound in any way by the Director's decisionsin the pre-filing consultation process. Compare that result with the applicant'spotential dilemma inherent in the Final Rule, as discussed above, wherethe Director's decision <T3>de facto </T3>could bind the applicant as a practical matter. I, therefore,believe that there is a persuasive disassociation of the applicant interlocutoryappeal issue and the public participation issue in this rule.Finally, I would highlight the standard for studies requested by resourceagencies adopted in the Final Rule. (Slip op. at. p. 84 and associatedregulatory text). Where a dispute is referred to the Director for resolutionover the need for and substance of a particular study, the resource agencywill be required to demonstrate that the proposed study is consistent with``generally accepted practice'' for such analyses in terms of both theobjectives of the study and the scope and methodology of the study. Thisnew standard will provide a critical balancing factor in the consultativeprocess to ensure that potential applicants are not required to conductunnecessary, unreasonable or extraordinary studies, which may be requestedotherwise for any number of reasons or purposes unrelated to or inconsistentwith the conduct of the relicensing process envisioned by Congress in ECPA.In the event of any disputes over studies between potential applicantsand resource agencies, the Director should complete a careful scrutinyof any requested study in dispute and require the resource agency to demonstratepersuasively that the study, as a matter of fact, is necessary, reasonableand fully consistent with generally accepted practice. 4. Applicability of Section 4(e) to Relicensing Proceedings The majority cites to its decision in the <T3>City of Pasadena Water and Power Department</T3> case (see footnoteNo. 188 in Final Rule slip opinion at 136) where it determined that section4(e) mandatory conditioning authority applied to relicensing proceedings.I note that I strongly disagreed with the majority's decision in that caseand issued a vigorous dissent. Therefore, it is unnecessary for me hereto reiterate my arguments as to why I believe the majority erred in applyingsection 4(e) authority to relicensing proceedings. I would note, however,that the majority's decision to incorporate implementation of section 4(e)for relicensing in the 10(j) process exacerbates significantly the problemsdiscussed in my dissent. 5. Applicability of Section 18 to Relicensing Proceedings The majority has included in the Final Rule a determination that the authorityof the Interior and Commerce Departments to prescribe fishways for projectsunder section 18 of the FPA applies to relicensing proceedings. I disagreewith this determination. The majority's decision unnecessarily jeopardizes two important Congressionalinterests in Commission relicense proceedings: to protect the interestsof the investors and the project's customers. (See the dissenting opinionin <T3>City of Pasadena Water and Power Department</T3>, 46 FERC andpara; 61,004(1989)). The Commission's <T3>Lynchburg</T3> decision cited in the Final Rule, held <T3>inter alia</T3>, that the authority to prescribe fishways could be<T3>reserved</T3> by the responsible agencies prior to the Commission'sissuance of an original license. However, this reserved authority had tobe expressly requested by the responsible agencies and expressly includedin the license. 39 FERC andpara; 61,079 at p. 61,219. If such authority was reserved in an original license and never acted on,I seriously question whether carrying that reserved authority into a relicenseproceeding would be appropriate after 30, 40 or 50 years of operations.The design and installation of fishways at hydroelectric projects is, generallyspeaking, very costly in terms of construction, operation and maintenancecosts, and potential negative impact on project operations and power generation.A potential licensee should be given the opportunity to include in anyeconomic feasibility assessment a reasonable estimate of expected futureexpenses. It is unreasonable to issue a license to an applicant and notat least put the licensee on notice that significant expenses are yet tocome, or to let decades pass without any action under the reserved authority.With respect to relicense applications that propose to do nothing morethan continue the existing operation without any modifications, it appearsto me to be grossly inappropriate to permit Interior or Commerce to requirethe design, construction, operation, and maintenance of costly fish passagefacilities without requiring Interior or Commerce to meet at least somethreshold standard of extraordinary circumstances. If the responsible agenciesdid not request or have the Commission expressly reserve the authorityto prescribe fishways during the processing of an original license, orif it was reserved but never used during the original term of the license,those agencies should carry a heavy burden of proof when attempting toimpose this requirement during the processing of a relicense application.Moreover, I believe that it is the responsibility of the Commission toevaluate and determine whether the request of Interior or Commerce to prescribefishways is necessary or appropriate in a relicense proceeding under thegeneral rubric of ``equal consideration'' of all power and resource values.The language contained in section 18 does not clearly indicate that Interiorand Commerce have an unquestionable right to impose fishways on a ``relicense''applicant. Indeed, as the Final Rule itself points out (slip op. at p.22), the legislative history of section 18 is sparse, and nothing in itindicates section 18 does or should automatically apply to relicensingproceedings. I also place considerable significance from a statutory construction perspectiveon the decision of Congress to enact the section 15 process in the ElectricConsumer Protection Act of 1986 (ECPA). I find it inexplicable that Congresswould have enacted section 15 with regard to the subject of fish and wildliferecommendations more generally, if there was any conceivable argument thatsection 18 should apply to relicensing. In the alternative, if section18 was deemed to apply to relicensing, Congress surely would have notedthat and rationalized its application as part of section 15. For these reasons, I believe the majority's decision to automatically applysection 18 to relicense proceedings is incorrect and I dissent on thatissue.6. Public Participation During Pre-filing Consultation The majority adopts in andSection; 16.8 ``Consultation Requirements,'' anew requirement for formal public participation in the joint meeting ofthe applicant and the resource agencies under paragraph (b)(3) in the firststage of mandatory pre-filing consultation. The purpose of the meetingis for the applicant and the resource agencies to review the applicant'sinformation package and to discuss the data and studies to be providedby the applicant in the relicensing process. The applicant, under andSection;16.8(i), must give prior public notice and also now make available to thepublic the same information package provided to the pertinent agencies.Members of the public in attendance at the joint meeting now are entitledto participate fully and express their views regarding resource issuesthat should be addressed in any new license application. Also, at the discretionof the existing license applicant, the public can participate in the sitevisit held for officials of the pertinent agencies coincident with thejoint meeting. This new requirement for public participation in the jointmeeting is justified on several grounds by the majority in the preamble(slip op. 125-129). With all due respect for my colleagues in the majority, I believe theyfundamentally have misapprehended the public participation comments ofcertain parties in response to the NOPR. There clearly was no need forthe majority to concoct a regulatory requirement for public participationin the pre-filing consultation stage of the Final Rule's relicensing process.I believe that, in fact, the procedure adopted by the majority has unnecessarilycomplicated the pre-filing process and, indeed, may work to inhibit, ratherthan facilitate, meaningful public participation at this stage of the relicensingprocess. I, therefore, feel compelled to dissent as to this requirement.Nothing in the Federal Power Act (FPA) or ECPA requires that the Commissionprovide for formal public participation in the consultation process thatprecedes a formal license application proceeding for either original licensingor relicensing. Indeed, FPA section 15, as amended by ECPA, contains specificprovisions requiring advance notice to the public of an existing licensee'sintent to file an application for a new license. It also requires thatextensive data pertaining to the project be made available to the publicat the time of the advance notice. Yet, Congress did not accompany theseprovisions with an expansion of the public's existing right to participateas interveners in formal license application proceedings. So, it is clearthat the majority has chosen, in its discretion, to establish such a right,even though it is not required by statute. Moreover, I believe that the Commission's current licensing process, whichbegins with the filing of an acceptable license or new license application,provides ample opportunity for meaningful public participation. Followingthe acceptance of an original or new license application, the Commissionpublicly notices the application. The notice contains pertinent detailsdescribing the location, design, and mode of operation, as well as otherfacts related to the proposed project that can be used to determine thepotential impact the proposed project may have on the environment. Thenotice also provides enough information for the public to assess whetherriparian or other property rights will be affected by the proposed project.The public is given an opportunity to meaningfully participate in the licenseproceeding as parties by filing a motion to intervene within the time prescribedin the public notice. Becoming a party in a license proceeding entitlesone to receive all filed documents in the proceeding, and participate fullyat each stage of the formal proceeding, and also ensures the right to seekan appeal or rehearing of any Commission action that may be perceived bya party to be adverse to its interest. In any and every imaginable situation,the Commission, if persuaded on the merits by any party's arguments, hasmore than ample authority in relicensing to address any resource issueand adequately remedy any identified environmental problem. The timingof this public participation does not diminish one iota the Commission'savailable authority to efficiently and effectively respond to any and allenvironmental concerns, even where additional analysis or study may benecessary. If rehearing is sought and then subsequently denied by the Commission,a party has a right to seek judicial review of the Commission's decision.In the relicensing context, an existing licensee is required to notifythe Commission five years prior to the expiration of its license whetheror not it will apply for a new license for the project (the ``notice ofintent'' or ``NOI''). Concurrent with this notification, and as noted above,the existing licensee must make extensive information about the projectavailable for public inspection at its business offices. Upon receipt ofthe existing licensee's notice of intent, and years before a formal licenseapplication is filed at the Commission, the Commission issues a publicnotice in the local newspaper that identifies the project and states whenand where the project information is available. There is, quite simply,no need for and no real benefit from <T3>formal </T3>public participation in the pre-filing consultation processat this time, because no application has yet been filed with the Commissionthat would trigger a formal licensing proceeding. However, I believe thatactive, but informal public involvement can, and indeed should, begin atthis point in the relicensing process without the need for additional regulatoryrequirements adopted by the majority.Any interested person or entity, for example, has the opportunity at thistime to contact the applicant in order to find out more about the project.Once an interested person or entity has reviewed the information made publicallyavailable pursuant to the NOI, a preliminary assessment of the impactscaused by the project can be made in order to develop an informal dialoguewith the applicant as to how to resolve potential problems. There is ampleopportunity during the remainder of the consultation process to work informallywith the applicant to discuss perceived problems. Clearly, active publicdiscussion at this stage of the process provides a precious ``early warning''advantage to the applicant. This ``early warning'' can be used by the applicantto effectively respond to what could otherwise become after the filingof an application, a protracted bureaucratic process that would includeappeals and rehearings and, possibly, evidentiary trial-type hearings beforeadministrative law judges. This potential consequence is obviously notin the applicant's best interest and should provide the incentive necessaryfor the applicant to pursue meaningful discussion with <T3>all </T3>interested parties. In addition to contacting and working closely with the applicant, interestedpersons or entities also have the opportunity to approach the state orFederal resource agencies at this early stage in the process to eitherassist or seek assistance in reviewing potential problems. For these reasons,I conclude that rules <T3>requiring </T3>formal public participation prior to the time an acceptablelicense application is filed are neither legally required nor necessarilyan appropriate policy. As discussed above, there is ample opportunity forthe public to get involved informally during the time frame of the pre-filingconsultation process, should anyone wish to do so. However, I do not mean to diminish the genuine concern my colleagues obviouslyfeel about ensuring public involvement at the earliest stage in the relicensingprocess. Requiring the potential applicant to hold a public meeting ator near the site of the existing project to obtain the views of the publicregarding resource issues that should be addressed in any application fornew license would have been an acceptable, and in my view more prudent,alternative method of guaranteeing public involvement prior to the actualfiling of an application. To accommodate the meeting participants' varyingwork schedules, the public meeting could have included both day and eveningsessions, and the potential applicant could have been required to publishadvance notice of the meeting in a local daily or weekly newspaper. Inaddition, the potential applicant could have been required to make audiorecordings or transcripts of the meeting, and further required to makea copy of the record available to the Commission and any resource agencythat requests one. The formalized regulatory method adopted by the majority, in my view, unjustifiablyencroaches on state public participation prerogatives by strongly encouragingstate agencies, if not all but requiring them, to participate with theapplicant and the interested public at a public meeting prior to the filingof an application with the Commission. Such a requirement will likely havea chilling effect on open and candid exchanges between resource agenciesand the applicant. In addition, such a procedure will encourage posturingby various interest groups and resource agencies for their respective constituenciesat a stage when candor and cooperation are most important. Including privateorganizations with narrow parochial concerns at this stage of the processalso clearly risks meetings that will be too large and unwieldy to controlwith numerous requests for otherwise unjustified studies and analysis.Since the public meeting is at such a preliminary point in the process,interests of the various parties could, and in all likelihood will, changeby the time the application is filed. And, of course, the eventual formalapplication may be changed materially from the proposal at the time ofthe NOI and the beginning of the pre-filing consultation process with theresource agencies. And, indeed, that is one of the several objectives ofthe process prior to filing of the formal application, <T3>i.e. </T3>developing the most acceptable form of application to befiled. Moreover, under this rule the applicant is now required to set up thispublic meeting as part of its compliance responsibilities with our relicensingregulations. Presumably failure to do so could cause the application tobe patently deficient or at least deficient, even if all other requirementsimposed by our regulations were adequately met. Ironically, original licenseapplicants are not required to do this under the Commission's current regulations,because the Commission heretofore has not considered it necessary or appropriate,even though original licenses govern construction of completely <T3>new</T3> projects, while relicensing will govern consideration of <T3>existing</T3> projects already constructed and operating. Such a requirementfor relicense applicants in my view is without any public interest justification,certainly without any basis in law, and in all likelihood will counterproductivelydisserve the clear public interest and Congressional intent in an expeditiousand effective relicensing process. Two other aspects of the majority's new public participation requirementcause serious concerns. First, the confidentiality provisions of the NOPRand the earlier drafts of the final rule have been adjusted now to reflectthe formal and mandatory participation of the public in the first jointmeeting of the applicant and the resource agencies. In some respects, thoseadjustments will serve to tilt the confidentiality approach against theexisting license applicant and extend certain competitive advantages tonew competing applicants, solely because of the new public participation.I view that result as generally contrary to the clear intent of Congressfor at least a ``level playing field,'' if not more, for existing licensesin ECPA. Second, I am fearful that public participation now in <T3>only</T3> the first joint meeting will be argued by proponents as providingonly a symbolic participation gesture. They will probably demand full publicparticipation throughout the entire pre-filing consultation process asthe only way to deal responsibly with the public. Thus, this first stepin that direction could, in the absence of future restraint by the majority,become a slippery slope to the demise altogether of the important consultativeprocess with resource agencies.<ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusion </ITAG>Many challenging and difficult issues have been resolved to my satisfactionin the formulation of this Final Rule. For that reason, I concur generallywith regard to this order. At the same time, the issues discussed abovewill play a critical role in the overall adequacy of the relicensing processover the next several years. I would have preferred strongly to have theFinal Rule adopt more acceptable positions on those key issues. Nonetheless,it is time to act on the long pending NOPR and provide some measure ofgeneral regulatory certainty and predictability in this important areaof our responsibilities. For that reason, I support going forward today.But, at the same time, I believe the Commission on rehearing must addressand remedy the serious problems I have outlined in this separate opinionin order to finish the job begun by Congress with the enactment of ECPAin 1986 and advanced by the NOPR last year. For these reasons, I concur in part and dissent in part.<ITAG tagnum="6">Charles A.
