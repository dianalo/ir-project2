He spoke on army radio after testimony by U.S. AssistantSecretary of State John H. Kelly raised a storm in Israel, which hasofficially boycotted the PLO, calling it a terrorist group bent onIsrael's destruction.   Kelly, replying to a question during a congressional hearing inWashington on Wednesday, said it would be an ``exaggeration'' to sayan official dialogue is taking place between Israel and thePalestine Liberation Organization.   But he said there was ``classified reporting about contacts''between the two that he would discuss only in a closed-door session.   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and Peres, chairman of theleft-leaning Labor Party that is a partner in the governingcoalition, deny any Israeli talks have taken place with the PLO.   ``It's an absolute lie. We are not speaking either directly orindirectly with that group,'' Shamir's spokesman Yossi Ahimeir said,reiterating the premier's remarks in a telephone interview today.   But Beilin claimed the denials were only technical.   ``For 2{ months, clear, official, unequivocal negotiations havebeen under way between the Israeli government headed by YitzhakShamir, via the Americans,'' Beilin said.   Other foreign diplomats, including Egypt's minister of foreignaffairs, Butros Ghali, were also involved in these contacts, headded.   Beilin said the entire process was indirect and that Israel, inkeeping with its policies, had not sent any official messages to PLOleaders.   ``We speak to the Americans, raise proposals, the Americans go tothe PLO in Tunis,'' Beilin said. ``They come back to us. If theytell us they talked to the PLO we shut the door, if they say theyspoke to Palestinians, we open it and listen to what they have tosay.''   Beilin also urged the government to ``recognize and takeadvantage of it (the contacts) before it will be too late.''   He said the government should deal with PLO Chief Yasser Arafator would have to face more radical Palestinian leaders.   Israel has held indirect contacts with the PLO in the past, mostnotably in 1981 when former U.S. Middle East envoy Philip C. Habiband U.N. official William Callahan helped negotiate a cease-fireagreement between the two along the Lebanese border.   The pact fell apart a year later when Israel invaded Lebanon torout guerrilla strongholds in response to attacks on Israelis inEurope by Palestinian extremists.   The Labor Party, meanwhile, toned down its threats to leave thegoverning coalition after appeals from the Bush administration togive Shamir's peace plan another chance.   Labor charges that the plan has been damaged by new hard-lineconditions imposed by Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc July 5 thatdecrease chances for Palestinian acceptance.   But after Labor ministers met Wednesday night, Peres said: ``Wehave no aspiration to break up the government. The Labor Party aimsto work for the advancement of the peace plan.''   The easing of Labor's threat appeared aimed at giving Shamir timeto renew his commitment to the peace initiative.   The plan calls for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank andGaza Strip to elect representatives for negotiations on limitedself-rule.   Likud's new conditions demand that the 19-month Palestinianuprising end before a vote occurs and specify that the Arabs inIsraeli-annexed east Jerusalem cannot cast ballots, a keyPalestinian demand.   Meanwhile, Israeli troops shot and killed a Palestinian in theGaza Strip when a gang of masked youths attacked a patrol withknives and axes, the army said today.   The victim was identified as Riad Hashem Ali El-Shakra, 18. Arabreports said he was shot in the chest at the Khan Yunis refugeecamp, and the army said he died after he was evacuated to SorokaHospital in southern Israel.   The death raised to at least 560 the number of Palestinianskilled since Arabs launched their uprising in the West Bank and Gazaagainst Israel's 22-year occupation. Thirty-five Israelis also havebeen slain.   Five other Palestinians were shot and wounded today as protestsbroke out during the Moslem holiday of Eid Al-Adha, or Feast ofSacrifice, the climax of the annual pilgrimage to Islam's holiestshrine in Mecca, Saudi Arabia.   Four of the wounded were in the Jabaliya refugee camp in Gaza.</TEXT></DOC>
