And like its mythological ancestor, this creature has some people frightened.    The new animal is a &quot;transgenic mouse,&quot; a benign-looking white laboratory animal that carries the genetic code for the virus causing acquired immune deficiency syndrome in every cell.    Transgenic mice have been bred before, for use in cancer research and in biotechnology, but these are the first to carry the blueprint for such a lethal contagious disease. Their creators' hypothesis is that the mice will mimic AIDS' long latency phase, which is a choice target for all anti-viral drugs because it precedes the onslaught of the disease. They hope the mice will help solve the mystery of the disease and serve as subjects for testing drugs.    But critics fear a mouse will bite a lab worker or escape and breed with wild mice, spreading the lethal virus like a 20th century plague. One suit has already been filed seeking to stop production of the hybrids.    From the beginning of the AIDS epidemic, scientists have bemoaned the lack of a perfect research animal. Rare and expensive chimpanzees can be infected by the AIDS virus, but they don't get sick from it. Mice are cheap and plentiful, but they aren't susceptible to the infection.    Malcolm Martin, a senior scientist at the NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, set out to change that. A year ago Dr. Martin reported initial success transplanting into mice a piece of the AIDS genetic code called the LTR, the nerve-center of the virus. &quot;So we wondered, why not do an experiment that would (also) mimic one phase of the virus infection in man. . . . Maybe what's going on (in latency) is that there are copies of the viral DNA that are totally silent, nonfunctional, sitting in regions of the (host) chromosome,&quot; he says. &quot;Why not try to duplicate this, by having a copy of the (whole genetic code) in every single cell of the mouse?&quot;    So Dr. Martin's team bred a female mouse and harvested the fertilized eggs. Using a microscopically fine needle, they injected the viral genetic code into the nucleus of the eggs, then reimplanted them into a surrogate mother mouse. Those eggs grew into baby mice harboring the AIDS virus in every cell. But the process is tricky; the transplant has fully spread the virus in only 10% of the embryos.    &quot;So far, we have four animals in which we know the injection worked. Now we're breeding them, and freezing the embryos&quot; for later use, Dr. Martin says. Next he will watch for signs that a latent disease state may be taking over in the parents and offspring. Dr. Martin has until April, the deadline under an agreement with NIH. Then he must destroy the mice.    Opinion is divided both on the worth and the safety of the experiment. The most alarming specter is being raised by Jeremy Rifkin, whose Foundation on Economic Trends last month filed suit in federal court in Washington, D.C., asking that the government halt attempts to breed the hybrids, update its biosafety standards and file environmental-impact statements covering all such genetic manipulations. The government's reply is expected soon.    &quot;Escape isn't a remote possibility,&quot; Mr. Rifkin warns, adding that once an animal is loose there's no way to get it back.    He isn't the only one who is concerned. Liebe F. Cavalieri, a scientist at Sloan-Kettering Memorial Cancer Institute in New York, says that due to the closed nature of the scientific fraternity, &quot;Others might not want to talk about (their reservations).&quot; But he insists that the danger of biting or escaping rodents &quot;is of concern not only to me but to others.&quot;    &quot;I imagine they can rationalize it,&quot; he says, but adds: &quot;I think that the risk isn't worth it.&quot;    Other scientists dismiss Mr. Rifkin as a &quot;cynical&quot; obstructionist. That's the view of Philip Leder, chairman of the department of genetics at the Harvard Medical School. Dr. Leder has used transgenic mice to explore the origins of breast cancer. He says they are a legitimate tool, even if limited by the differences between injecting AIDS genes into mouse cells and a natural case of human infection.    And Dr. Martin dismisses Mr. Rifkin's catastrophic vision as a &quot;National Enquirer scenario.&quot; The mice are locked in a maximum security lab of the kind reserved for such killers as smallpox or Lassa fever, he explains. They live in a sealed glass cage, reachable only through gloved portholes. The cage is antiseptically bordered by bleach-filled &quot;dunk-tanks,&quot; and a device to heat-sterilize animal waste is nearby. The lab is secured behind four locked doors and one screened vestibule, all mined with mousetraps.    &quot;I would like to say (chances of escape) are zero,&quot; Dr. Martin says. &quot;But since I'm a scientist, I'll just say they're very, very slim.&quot;    NIH's Institutional Biosafety committee voted 5-0 to approve the experiment, says its chairman Dinah Singer, a Ph.D. molecular biologist. The committee also added safety measures, such as a clear plastic door through which an entering scientist can see &quot;if a mouse is scratching to get out.&quot; Ms. Singer also urged NIH to breed some special, enfeebled mouse strains that couldn't survive outside the lab.    Mr. Rifkin argues that such measures aren't enough. He and his group want the court to force NIH to do (environmental impact statements) on all labs, government and commercial, under contract to the government, he says. He says this hasn't been done since 1976 -- before AIDS and before recent refinements in genesplicing.    Ms. Singer counters that her committee approached the experiment with the utmost caution. &quot;It's very easy to say no,&quot; she says. &quot;But all of us at NIH feel a responsibility to do something about AIDS. And research isn't without risk.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
