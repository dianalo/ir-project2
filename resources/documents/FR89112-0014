L. No. 91-508,(codified at 12 U.S.C. 1829b, 12 U.S.C. 1951 <T3>et seq.,</T3> and 31 U.S.C. 5311-5324), authorizes the Secretary ofthe Treasury to require financial institutions to keep records and filereports that the Secretary determines have a high degree of usefulnessin criminal, tax, and regulatory matters. Pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 5312(a)(2)(U),the Secretary has designated certain casinos as ``financial institutions''for purposes of the Bank Secrecy Act. <T3>See</T3> 31 CFR 103.11(g)(7). The Secretary has imposed particularrecordkeeping requirements on these casinos. <T3>See</T3> 31 CFR 103.36.The notice published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on April 7, 1988 (53 FR 11513) proposed two amendmentsto the current recordkeeping requirements. Treasury is adopting the proposalsas a final rule. The second enumerated amendment provides that casinossubject to the Bank Secrecy Act regulations must retain the records whichthey use for monitoring their customers' gaming activity. A minor changein wording has been made to the second amendment. In maintaining the sameword used elsewhere in the regulations, the word ``player's'' has beendeleted, and the word ``customer's'' has been substituted therefor.The third enumerated amendment adds a requirement that casinos which input,retain, or store information on computer disk, tape, or other machine-readablemedia must retain such information in machine-readable form. The thirdamendment goes on to require that casinos retain the indexes, books, filedescriptions, programs, and similar materials which would enable a personreadily to access and review the records that are required to be made andretained under the Bank Secrecy Act regulations and are kept in machine-readableform. In accordance with andSection; 103.38(d) of the regulations, the machine-readablemedia and accompanying indexes, books, etc. must be kept for a period offive years.Pursuant to these new amendments, if a casino keeps track of a customer'sgaming activity by inputting all or some of the data from a ``rating card''(see ``Discussion of Comments,'' below) on that player into a computer,even for a short period of time, such data must be retained in machine-readableform. For purposes of the final rule, the term ``machine-readable'' meanscapable of being read by the automated data processing system used by thecasino. The data may be transferred to other computer disks, magnetic tapes,or machine-readable media and may be retained off-line.It is emphasized that the final rule requires neither the rating of playersnor the purchase or rental of automated data processing systems to complywith the recordkeeping requirements of andSection;andSection; 103.33 and 103.36.Otherwise stated, the rule requires rating records to be retained, if theyare made, and requires computer information to be retained, if such informationcontains, in whole or in part, a record required to be made and kept underthe Bank Secrecy Act regulations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Comments</ITAG>Few comments on the proposed amendments were received. Comments regardingthe second enumerated amendment generally attempted to caution Treasuryabout the inexactness of the documents which casinos use to monitor theircustomers' gaming activity. These documents, which casinos must retainfor a period of five years under the new rule, are frequently referredto as ``player rating forms,'' ``player rating records,'' or ``player ratingcards.'' They are used to keep track of customers' play, and ultimatelybecome internal marketing tools for the casinos.Treasury concludes that the records overall are sufficiently accurate touse them for Bank Secrecy Act purposes. Given the lack of other recordswhich would reflect cash activity of customers on the casino floor, Treasuryfinds a high degree of criminal, tax, and regulatory utility in the retentionof rating forms. Treasury expresses no opinion, explicitly or implicitly,as to their accuracy for any other purpose.The Internal Revenue Service, in performing compliance examinations pursuantto 31 CFR 103.46, can be expected to review player rating forms to determinewhether reports, as required under andSection; 103.22(a)(2), have been filed.If, in the course of an examination, a player rating card that reflectsa cash buy-in exceeding $10,000 on one customer is discovered, Treasurywould expect that a report on that transaction has been filed. It wouldbe incongruous for the casino to argue that it need not treat the ratingrecord made by its employee as determinative of whether it should havefiled a report, on the ground that the record might have been inaccurate.The point is that the casino has in its possession evidence that one ofits employees, a rater, had perceived that a customer engaged in a transactionexceeding $10,000 in currency. In sum, Treasury expects casinos to filereports on all transactions they believe involve more than $10,000, asreflected in the retained rating records.The third enumerated amendment is intended to lessen significantly theamount of time in reviewing specific records required of casinos underthe Bank Secrecy Act regulations for compliance examination and law enforcementpurposes. Comments regarding this amendment dealt with the costs and burdensof reprogramming automated data processing systems and of providing informationfrom the systems to Bank Secrecy Act compliance examiners and enforcementpersonnel. Some commenters incorrectly assumed that the information mustbe retained in a fashion that would make the information ``most easily''retrievable, <T3>e.g.,</T3> chronologically, by player's name, etc., when it is requestedduring an examination or pursuant to a andSection; 103.61 administrativesummons.The proposed rule did not, and was not intended to, suggest the mannerin which the information is to be retained. The proposed rule, and nowthe final rule, simply state that, if a Bank Secrecy Act record, in wholeor in part, is input into, or stored or retained in, an automated dataprocessing system, that record (or portion thereof) must be retained inmachine-readable form. It is the corresponding requirement_that pertinentindexes, books, programs, record layouts, file description, etc. be retained_whichpermits ready access to the machine-readable information. Any reprogrammingneeded to meet these requirements is viewed as minimal by Treasury.The information and accompanying indexes, programs, file descriptions,etc., must be kept for five years. One commenter suggested that it mightneed 130 reels of magnetic tape to maintain five years of player ratinginformation. According to the commenter, if player rating information overa five year period were requested on a named customer, the casino's owncomputer would have to be devoted to processing all 130 reels, therebydetracting its devotion to in-house business use.It is expected that, as they have in the past, Internal Revenue Servicepersonnel involved in Bank Secrecy Act examinations and enforcement andthe casinos will be able to reach mutually acceptable terms on the timeand manner of retrieving computer information in this rather extreme case.A goal would be to obtain the information as expeditiously as possible,with the least inconvenience to the casino. Also, it is important to considerthat, if necessary, the reels and pertinent documentation may be obtainedby a andSection; 103.61 summons, removed from the casino, then processedby the government agents themselves.One commenter suggested that, without requiring a specified manner of storingthe computer information (<T3>e.g.,</T3> by date, customer name, etc.), thereby commensurately requiringprocessing of numerous reels, Treasury has ignored the requirement thatthe Bank Secrecy Act records be ``readily accessible.'' Treasury disagrees.Again, certain accompanying information (instructions, programs, recordlayouts, etc.) that exists when the computer information is prepared makesthe computer information readily accessible. Still, Treasury would notdiscourage any casino from keeping its computer information in a mannerthat is more readily accessible than other manners. It is assumed thateach casino would balance the costs and burdens of developing more readilyaccessible records against the costs and burdens of running various numbersof reels to provide requested information, or providing the machine-readablemedia for the examiners themselves to process off-site. Finally, regardless of the manner in which the stored computer informationis organized, virtually any computer retention format would make Bank SecrecyAct records far more readily accessible than they currently are, <T3>i.e.</T3>, by pouring through the great volumes of paper records themselves.<ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusion </ITAG>For the reasons discussed above, the amendments are adopted as proposed,except that, in the second amendment, the word ``player's'' is deleted,and the word ``customer's'' is substituted therefor.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291 </ITAG>This final rule is not a major rule for purposes of Executive Order 12291.It is not anticipated to have an annual effect on the economy of $100 millionor more. It will not result in a major increase in costs or prices forconsumers, individual industries, Federal, state, or local government agencies,or geographic regions. It will not have any significant adverse effectson competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or onthe ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-basedenterprises in domestic or foreign markets. A Regulatory Impact Analysistherefore is not required.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act </ITAG>It is hereby certified under section 605(b) of the Regulatory FlexibilityAct, 5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>, that this final rule will not have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>The collection of information contained in this final rule has been reviewedand approved by the Office of Management and Budget in accordance withthe requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)) undercontrol no. 1505-0087. The estimated annual burden associated with thecollection of information in this rule is approximately 4.1 hours per recordkeeper.Comments concerning the accuracy of this burden estimate and suggestionsfor reducing this burden should be directed to Department Clearance Officer,Department of the Treasury, Room 2224, 1500 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.,Washington, D.C. 20220, and to the Office of Management and Budget, Washington,D.C., 20503, Attention: Desk Officer for the Departmental Offices, Departmentof the Treasury. <ITAG tagnum="84">Drafting Information</ITAG>The principal author of this document is the Office of the Assistant GeneralCounsel (Enforcement).
