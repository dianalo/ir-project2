Across breeds these two sets of factors are negatively correlated,i.e. breeds with a high production potential have a low level of resistanceto environmental stresses and vice versa. This phenomenon is the reasonfor genotype-environment interactions in production characters. Understandingthe phenomenon enables rational decisions to be made when implementingcross-breeding or upgrading strategies and in determining the relativepressures that should be applied to productive and adaptive traits whenselecting within a breed. It also assists in deciding whether geneticor environmental solutions are appropriate to a particular problem. Theconcept is presented and discussed in relation to the requirements forbreed evaluation studies. (author). 13 refs, 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
