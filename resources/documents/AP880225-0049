A successful visit could trigger a final effort by the outgoingReagan administration to champion Arab-Israeli peace talks.   But Shultz's tour, which begins today, seems just as likely toinflame Israeli-Palestinian violence in the occupied lands, whereleaflets distributed last weekend called for massive protestsagainst Shultz.   Rarely in recent years has a ranking U.S. official on a MiddleEast peace mission faced such universal public skepticism in thegovernment-influenced Arab press.   ``These trips will bring no results,'' said Egyptian columnistMoussa Sabry, who is close to President Hosni Mubarak.   Syria's state-run Damascus Radio branded Shultz's visit``nothing but a political airlift to rescue Israel and gain time.''   An editorial in the English-language Jordan Times said the U.S.mission has been ``greeted throughout the Middle East with acombination of skepticism and laughs.''   Government officials in pro-Western Egypt and Jordan welcomedthe renewed U.S. interest in Middle East peace, spurred by 11 weeksof Israeli-Palestinian clashes in which more than 60 Palestinianshave been killed.   But Jordan's King Hussein, increasingly disillusioned withAmerican policy over the last two years, has not announced plans tomeet Shultz in Amman.   However, the two could meet in London next week on Shultz's wayback to Washington. Hussein is considered indispensable to any U.S.plan to end the 40-year-old Arab-Israeli conflict.   Arab leaders generally have become increasingly despondent aboutU.S. efforts following the failure of a string of American missionsto the region in the last decade.   Mubarak warned that the U.S. proposals ``must stay away from anywords or provisions that were in the Camp David agreements'' signedby Egypt, Israel and the United States in 1978.   Hard-line Arab states have made it clear they oppose any partialsolutions, such as those the Americans have in mind.   The U.S. suggestions leaked so far resemble a juiced-up CampDavid: a period of limited self-government for Palestinians in theIsraeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip followed by talks on afinal settlement.   The Arab world is exhilarated by what Palestinians call ``theuprising'' and Palestinians are in no mood to compromise on theirdemand for some form of statehood _ a status no formal American orIsraeli plan has conceded.   ``The essential quality of the national rights of thePalestinians ... is not up for bargaining, negotiations orcompromise,'' wrote Jordan Times editor Rami Khouri.   The Americans have not formally announced their ideas, but whatis known so far leaves some room for negotiation.   There is no word of conditions for talks on a final settlement,supposed to start by December. U.S. officials have not defined theinternational conference they say could launch Arab-Israeli talksin April.   Arab states insist on a conference attended by all parties tothe conflict, as well as the five permanent members of the U.N.Security Council, and talks aimed at a final _ not interim _solution.   But Shultz's ability to compromise is limited by Washington'sally, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who resists calls toaccelerate the Camp David process or to surrender the occupiedterritories, a universal Arab demand.   The Palestinian unrest has reasserted the Palestine LiberationOrganization's role as their spokesman, damaging U.S. and Israeliefforts to find ``alternative'' Palestinian leaders to talk with.   The growth in PLO prestige occurs just as the United States istrying to defy the United Nations by forcing closure of the PLOmission to the world body in New York.   The PLO returned the American snubs by ordering Palestinians inthe West Bank and Gaza Strip to boycott the Shultz visit,threatening to rob Shultz of contact with the people at the heartof the conflict.   The PLO's increased strength, coupled with Washington's refusalto meet with it, bolsters the Middle East role of the Soviet Union,a staunch backer of the organization.   At the same time, the shift of the conflict to one betweenIsraelis and Palestinians has moved America's main Arab friends,Egypt and Jordan, a few steps toward the sidelines.   The result makes it more difficult for the Americans andIsraelis to prevent the Soviets from taking a role in any peacetalks, something the United States has accepted grudgingly andShamir still rejects.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   John Rice has covered Middle East affairs since1984 as The AP's correspondent in Amman.</TEXT></DOC>
