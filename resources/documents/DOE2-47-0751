Onesuch class of materials is that of the boron-containing ceramics, e.g.,boron carbide, boron nitride, boron phosphides, aluminum boride, andboron silicides. The authors report the results of an effort to extendthe use of preceramic polymers to boron-containing materials. The motivationfor this work was to utilize processable materials which give, in general,boron carbide as the major ceramic phase upon pyrolysis. A route to solubleboron-containing polymers has been developed. The synthesis and characterizationof phosphorus-containing monomeric and polymeric derivatives of decaborane(B{sub 10}H{sub 14}) are given. Preparation and characterization of boron-containingceramic materials from these molecular and macromolecular species arediscussed. Success was achieved in the areas of ceramic-fiber and monolithproduction and in the area of binder applications for composites of advancedceramic materials.</TEXT></DOC>
