The effect is a peculiar reaction of certain crystals to laser light that was discovered in the 1960s. A photorefractive crystal can, among other things, gather light from lasers shone on it and beam the light toward any nearby shiny object. If the object is moved, the beam tracks it like a human-operated spotlight. The crystals also can fuse two laser beams or, like photographic film, record holograms, simulated three-dimensional images.    When shown such odd tricks, &quot;even hardened physicists, weary from decades of proposal writing, instinctively begin to play&quot; with the crystals in the hope of finding new tricks, writes Jack Feinberg in a recent issue of the magazine &quot;Physics Today.&quot;    Photorefractive play is getting serious, though. Researchers at Stanford University are experimenting with the crystals to switch light beams into desired channels in optical-fiber communications. At the University of Colorado, scientists are studying the crystals' use in &quot;optical associative memories,&quot; computer devices that are structured roughly like the brain's net of neurons but which use light instead of electricity to carry information. Scientists also hope to use the crystals to direct laser beams that etch microscopic circuit patterns in computer chips.    One of the most remarkable photorefractive applications is the &quot;novelty&quot; filter, which is used in conjunction with video systems. Recently developed by a group led by Mr. Feinberg, a researcher at the University of Southern California, and by other scientists, these systems register only moving or changing objects in their visual fields: for instance, one pointed at a parking lot at 2 a.m. might picture only a skulking thief.    The photorefractive effect was discovered by researchers trying to encode information in beams of laser light. To their frustration, the crystals of barium titanate and certain other compounds tended to deform the beams. &quot;It was called 'optical damage,'&quot; says Mr. Feinberg.    Later, scientists found that the damage occurs when light waves rearrange charged particles inside the crystals. That warps the crystal's lattice of atoms, distorting the light.    In the spotlight trick, for example, a shiny object, say a piece of tin foil, reflects laser light into a photorefractive crystal. That alters the crystal's lattice, causing more of the light entering the crystal to be deflected toward the foil. The light, in turn, is reflected right back to the crystal to further alter its structure, causing yet more light to be deflected toward the foil. The process snowballs, quickly building up a beam of light between crystal and foil. When the foil is moved, light from it induces a new crystal pattern that re-establishes the beam within a few seconds.    In the novelty filter, light reflected from a scene is passed through a photorefractive crystal that deflects it, preventing the scene from being registered by the system's video camera. But when something in the scene changes, the light hitting the crystal changes. That momentarily alters the crystal's structure, allowing part of the formerly diverted light to get through to the system's video monitor. The crystal lattice quickly resumes a deflecting pattern when such changes cease.    The novelty filter, aside from its possible crime prevention uses, might help computerized vision systems quickly zero in on the important parts of cluttered images. For instance, &quot;you might be able to see moving bacteria more clearly on a messy background,&quot; said Mark Cronin-Golomb, a Tufts University researcher who has developed a prototype novelty filter. The devices might also be employed in automated surveillance systems, such as robots that scan battlefields for advancing enemies, said USC's Mr. Feinberg. </TEXT></DOC>
