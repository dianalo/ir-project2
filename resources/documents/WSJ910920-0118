Masashi Kojima told reporters last December that he oncecalculated his own loss on the shares at as much as 30million yen ($223,290). &quot;NTT's stock has to go up; otherwise,I will face a difficult retirement,&quot; he said.</LP><TEXT>   Soon, foreigners will likely be granted the dubiousprivilege of investing in NTT, which at 11.84 trillion yen isthe world's largest company in terms of stock-market value.Japan's Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications yesterdayannounced that it had reversed a longtime policy and nowsupports non-Japanese ownership in NTT, Japan's dominantdomestic telecommunications carrier, as well as in KokusaiDenshin Denwa Co., Japan's international phone company.   Although the proposal still requires formal Diet approval,the ministry has been the only major opponent of foreignownership of the stock, so passage is virtually certain.   Under the recommendation, foreigners would be allowed tohold as much as 20% of the shares outstanding of bothcompanies, a level the ministry said is similar to U.S. andCanadian limits on those countries' major telecommunicationscompanies. Foreigners will still be prohibited from holdingexecutive positions at the two companies. (A few foreignerscurrently control some NTT shares through proxy arrangementswith Japanese securities firms.)   The new law could take effect as soon as next year. BothNTT and KDD said they welcomed the move, and NTT added thatit would explore listing its shares on foreign stockexchanges.   The change carries symbolic significance because it willopen NTT -- one of Japan's most revered and powerfulinstitutions -- to outsiders. Critics of Japanese businesspractices often have pointed to the ban on foreign investmentin NTT as an emblem of the country's allegedly closedeconomy.   But for the time being, at least, many analysts considerthe ministry's move a hollow gesture. &quot;NTT is really a goodcompany,&quot; a Nomura Securities Co. analyst said, &quot;but at thismoment, I don't think any Japanese broker is recommending NTTor KDD's stock very aggressively.&quot; He noted that NTT hasrecently reported sharp declines in profit because ofincreased competition.   Even Hisamitsu Gannyo, director of the ministry'stelecommunications policy bureau, conceded after announcingthe new policy: &quot;Now that the {NTT share} price is so low, wedo not hear many people inquiring as to why they can't holdthe shares.&quot;   NTT's share price, after more than doubling soon aftertrading began in 1987, is now down 53% from the initialoffering price of 1.6 million yen a share. In addition to thesagging share price, NTT's annual dividend is only 5,000 yena share, a typically tiny Japanese yield of 0.66%, based onThursday's closing price of 759,000 yen a share. KDD pays a25-yen dividend per share, a 0.2% yield on Thursday's closingprice of 12,200 yen.   Nevertheless, the shares could draw overseas investors.NTT accounts for an unusually large portion of the Tokyostock market's value -- 2% of the exchange's First Section atthe end of last year -- making it required buying forinstitutional portfolios designed to reflect the weighting ofthe market's Nikkei Stock Average of 225 stocks.   And NTT does have some fans. UBS Phillips andamp; Drew's Tokyooffice issued a buy recommendation on NTT in May, citing thecompany's relatively high cash flow. Jeffrey Zavattero ofJardine Fleming Securities (Japan) Ltd. said he thinks thestock has plunged too far and is worthwhile at a price ashigh as 1.2 million yen a share. (Both firms are more bearishon KDD.)   In many ways, NTT and KDD seem like Japanese versions ofAmerican Telephone andamp; Telegraph Corp.: once-bloatedtelecommunications monopolies scrambling to adjust toderegulation and new competition. Last year, for example, NTTdisclosed that it had accidentally overcharged customers atotal of 4.8 billion yen during the previous five years.   Increasingly, the two companies have been forced tocompete with aggressive new entrants since deregulation in1985. Three new domestic long-distance competitors havepushed NTT's domestic rates down by half during the past sixyears, and the company faces even stiffer challenges in thegrowing mobile-telephone market. Similarly, two newchallengers to KDD have drawn down Japan's notoriouslyexpensive overseas calling costs by more than 25%.   In addition to cutting rates, NTT has cut its payrollsince 1985 by 56,000 employees to 257,000, and it aims toreduce its work force by an additional 10% by 1994. NTT hasso far avoided an ATandamp;T-style breakup. However, the company isexpected to list its computer systems -- integration andmobile-telecommunications units as separate companies on theTokyo Stock Exchange.   NTT, like ATandamp;T, is aggressively moving overseas and intonew technologies. Indeed, NTT is sometimes viewed with aweand fear in Washington. Some U.S. government and industryofficials contrast NTT's long-term plans, coordinated withthe Japanese government, for building a 21st-century&quot;information highway&quot; with the hodgepodge development of theU.S. telecommunications sector, particularly since thebreakup of ATandamp;T. They conclude that Japan is once againpoised to use industrial policy to take the lead in a crucialtechnological area.   But the picture isn't that simple. NTT and the Japanesegovernment have often worked together to the benefit of both,but recently, different government factions have been warringwith each other and with NTT over the telecommunicationsgiant's fate, clouding the company's future.   Still, NTT and KDD work much more closely with Japanesegovernment and industry than ATandamp;T ever did. ATandamp;T was aprivate monopoly that was broken up and deregulated; NTT wasa government-owned company that is still being privatized.The government started selling off shares in 1987, and thereare now about 1.7 million shareholders. But the Ministry ofFinance still holds 66% of the company. TheTelecommunications Ministry's employee association holds10.9% of KDD's shares, with NTT owning another 9.9%.   NTT has long been a central part of Japanese industrialpolicy. Its extensive research-and-development resources andits closed procurement policy have helped its &quot;familymembers&quot; -- led by NEC Corp., Fujitsu Ltd. and Hitachi Ltd.-- grow into some of the world's largest electronicscompanies. The company has also had close ties to Japan'spolitical elite. NTT's former chairman was arrested in 1989as part of the Recruit bribery scandal that brought down manyof Japan's top political leaders.   The four-year roller-coaster ride of NTT's share priceillustrates the benefits and costs of such a closerelationship. Two months after the company issued its firstbatch of shares in February 1987, the stock had jumped toabout 3.2 million yen. Now, the share price is aboutone-fourth its peak level.   Some analysts say the plunge occurred because the stockmay have been overvalued from the start, but also becauseNTT's profits have been steadily eroding because of newcompetition. The Recruit scandal and the overall poorperformance of the Tokyo market have also hurt the shares.NTT reported unconsolidated pretax profit for the year endedMarch 31 of 414.3 billion yen, down 14.5% from the previousyear. KDD reported net operating income of 4.43 billion yenfor the year, down 49%.   And the future looks no better. NTT is officiallyprojecting earnings for the current year of 402 billion yen,down 3%, and sources said that internally the company isprojecting a bigger decline.   Moreover, Japan's telecommunications bureaucrats arepushing further deregulation and holding a tough line againstNTT rate increases on local calls to make up for newcompetition in the long-distance market -- moves that wouldtend to depress NTT's profits and share price -- not just forthe public good, but also simply to assert a measure ofcontrol over NTT, analysts said. The Finance Ministry wantsto unload half of the remaining shares it holds, but can't doso unless the price rises. It already has twice delayed thesale of NTT stock.   Japanese industry also wants a healthier NTT. The NihonKeizai Shimbun, Japan's leading financial daily, reportedlast month that poor profits could force NTT to scale backspending on advanced infrastructure -- the very plans raisingconcerns in Washington.   &quot;Perhaps having foreigners participate would lift theshare price or create enough interest in NTT's shares listedoverseas to enable it to get financing more effectively,&quot;said Michael Jeremy of Baring Securities (Japan) Ltd.   But he isn't recommending the stock. &quot;It's a very powerfulcompany with a lot of inertia,&quot; he said, &quot;with lots ofproblems left over from 20 years of unmonitored development.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
