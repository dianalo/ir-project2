Cabot expects to report profit from continuing operationsof about $4 million before preferred dividends, down about65% from $11.6 million a year earlier, Mr. Bodman said. Inthe latest quarter, an accounting adjustment of $6.3 millionrelated to the spinoff of Cabot's oil and gas businessearlier this year resulted in a loss of 15 cents to 20 centsa share, Mr. Bodman added.</LP><TEXT>   A year earlier, a loss from discontinued operations of$1.5 million made net income $10.1 million, or 37 cents ashare. Revenue fell some 14% to about $325 million from $380million, restated to reflect discontinued operations.   Mr. Bodman, in an interview, attributed the declinesmainly to sluggish economies world-wide, which lowered salesof specialty chemicals. Cabot's sales of liquefied naturalgas, or LNG, also were hurt by warm weather and low prices.Cabot imports LNG by tanker from Algeria through a terminalin Boston. In fiscal 1991, Cabot imported 11 cargoes of gas,compared with 20 the previous year, said J. Scott Esler,director of investor relations.   Following the spinoff of its oil and gas business, Cabot'smain products are specialty chemicals, including carbonblack, used in making tires, inks and other products;tantalum, used in making electronic components; and fumedsilica, an ingredient of silicone rubber. Cabot also makesearplugs and other industrial-safety products. The company isthe market leader, or close to it, in most of the businessesit has retained after the spinoff.   &quot;We're not looking for much significant improvement in theeconomy next year,&quot; Mr. Bodman said. But Cabot's earningsshould improve somewhat due to cost-cutting measures, whichhave trimmed $25 million of annual costs over the past fiscalyear, he added. Cabot also expects to hold capital spendingto less than $100 million in fiscal 1992, compared with about$200 million in fiscal 1991 and $270 million in fiscal 1990,he said.   Cabot has worked hard over the past few years to controlenvironmental expenses, including creating a board committeeconcerned with environmental matters, Mr. Bodman said. Thecompany is involved in several pollution cleanups but expectscleanup costs &quot;to be stable over time,&quot; he added. During thepast three years, Cabot has set aside more than $40 millionof reserves to cover such expenses. &quot;By and large, we'recomfortable that the reserves are appropriate,&quot; he said.   Cabot's revenue should improve considerably if the economyturns around, Mr. Bodman said. In the last half of fiscal1991 and the first half of fiscal 1992, Cabot will open fivenew overseas chemical plants, including one in Wales thatwill increase its fumed silica capacity 50%. The company hasmade a &quot;tentative commitment&quot; to refurbish a carbon blackplant in Czechoslovakia, which Cabot would operate andjointly own with a government concern.   Earlier in the year, Cabot reported an $84.3 million gainfrom the spinoff of its oil and gas business. The figure wasbased on estimated closing costs and was adjusted in thefourth quarter to about $78 million to reflect the actualcosts, said Mr. Esler.</TEXT></DOC>
