Developing countries should concentrate anti-poaching efforts onportions of their large wildlife conservation areas if they cannotprotect all the land adequately, the researchers said.   Rhino populations declined 63 percent a year and elephant numbersdropped 12 percent a year between 1979 and 1985 in Zambia's LuangwaValley, despite an anti-poaching operation than began in 1979, theresearchers wrote.   Areas most patrolled by authorities showed the least decline, andvice versa, taking into account the size of each area, theresearchers wrote in today's issue of the British joural Nature.   Results ``support the view that an important factor in theoverall decline in rhino and elephant numbers across the rest ofAfrica is a shortage of manpower, and ultimately of resources,within national conservation departments,'' said N. Leader-Williamsand S.D. Albon of the University of Cambridge in England.   In countries that spend relatively little on conservation, thebest strategy to protect economically valuable animals is probablyto concentrate resources on relatively small areas of the reserves,the researchers wrote.   Such an approach has already helped in stabilizing numbers ofblack rhinos in Kenya over the past year or so, they said.</TEXT></DOC>
