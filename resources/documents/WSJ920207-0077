Yesterday, as expected, parent Salomon Inc. reported aloss of $29 million for the fourth quarter. Salomon blamedthe loss largely on a charge relating to its Phibro EnergyInc. oil trading and refining unit. But the Salomon Brotherssecurities unit, which includes stock and bond trading andunderwriting, had a pretax profit of just $27 million for thequarter, reflecting slumping trading revenue.</LP><TEXT>   Salomon's results look particularly poor alongside theblockbuster fourth-quarter earnings of other big investmentbanks. The top four publicly owned securities firms, MerrillLynch andamp; Co., American Express Co.'s Shearson Lehman BrothersInc., Morgan Stanley Group Inc. and Bear Stearns Cos., postedcombined fourth-quarter profits of more than $500 million,which helped to catapult the securities business to whatcould be its best profit year ever.   Analysts said Salomon's meager results signal the problemthe big investment bank faces in earning plump profitsfollowing its Treasury-auction bidding scandal. The scandalhas cost the firm some big customers -- some of them onlytemporarily -- and led to the departure of some employees.Salomon Inc.'s fourth-quarter operating loss was the widestsince 1987's fourth quarter, the period that included theOctober stock-market crash, when Salomon had a loss of $74million.   The latest results &quot;suggest that Salomon has been facingsome difficulties&quot; in making money since its scandal surfacedin August, said Lawrence Eckenfelder, a brokerage analyst forPrudential Securities Inc. &quot;Trading profits were soft in aquarter where the Street generally did pretty well,&quot; he said,adding that even during Wall Street's boom times, Salomon&quot;didn't put the numbers up.&quot;   Mr. Eckenfelder and some other analysts predict thatSalomon's stock will continue to underperform other brokerageshares. Salomon's stock price is up 9% since Dec. 10, lessthan the 15% rise in the securities brokers industry group ofthe Dow Jones Equity Market Index. Yesterday, Salomon'sshares closed unchanged at $29.50 a share in late New YorkStock Exchange trading.   Salomon declined to comment beyond its earnings release.The firm, concerned about the impact of the poor numbers,telegraphed the expected loss to analysts and others lastmonth. Salomon's trading positions, like those of otherfirms, are &quot;marked to market&quot;; that is, even &quot;open&quot; tradingpositions are reported as if they were closed out at the endof the day. Thus, trading strategies that are temporarilyunder water could eventually reap gains.   Even with the recent loss, Salomon posted 1991 net incomeof $507 million, or $3.90 a share -- its third-best year and67% higher than the $303 million, or $2.08 a share, it earnedin 1990. But most of 1991's profits came in the first half,before the Treasury scandal surfaced. In the third quarter,Salomon took a $200 million pretax charge for potentiallitigation costs from the bidding scandal. Salomon's 1991profit eclipsed that of several major investment banks,including Morgan Stanley, which earned a record $475.1million. (Salomon's record was $557 million in 1985.)   Still, the fourth-quarter results are disappointingbecause they come in the first earnings period in whichSalomon's new management has been in control. Salomon oustedits former management in the wake of the firm's admissionsthat it repeatedly violated government rules in bidding atTreasury securities auctions. In August, famed investorWarren Buffett was named Salomon's interim chairman, andSalomon executive Deryck Maughan became chief operatingofficer.   Securities analysts were baffled by Salomon's poor tradingresults, given the power of its sophisticated global bondtrading and arbitrage operations. Because Salomon has alwaysdepended on securities trading for the bulk of its earnings,its results have long been volatile. However, other big WallStreet firms had strong trading revenues in the fourthquarter.   Some analysts speculated that the firm may be takingsmaller trading positions than in the past, which would limitboth losses and gains. If that's the case, then a decision bymanagement to loosen restrictions on traders could produce aprofit rebound.   Salomon Inc.'s fourth-quarter loss of $29 million, or 41cents a share, compared with a loss of $15 million, or 28cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Fourth-quarterrevenue was $1.55 billion, down 19% from the $1.93 billion inthe year-earlier period.   The Salomon Brothers unit's fourth-quarter pretax profitof $27 million compared with a loss of $90 million in 1990'sfourth quarter. &quot;The disappointing results in each of thesequarters was attributable primarily to lower revenues fromtrading activities,&quot; Salomon said. Total principaltransaction -- or trading -- revenue was $281 million in thequarter, 31% higher than the $215 million in the dismal 1990fourth quarter.   Salomon said its revenue from stock and foreign exchangetrading fell for all of 1991, but the firm didn't disclosewhy fourth-quarter trading results were disappointing.   Amid slumping oil prices, Phibro reported a fourth-quarterloss of $60 million, compared with pretax profit of $62million a year earlier. Phibro's results in 1991's fourthquarter include a $60 million pretax charge to write downPhibro's refining and marketing inventories to reflect loweroil prices.   For 1991, Salomon Brothers posted pretax profit of $1.04billion, more than double the $416 million for 1990. Phibrohad a loss of $34 million in 1991; that compares with recordprofit of $492 million in 1990. Salomon Inc.'s revenue was$9.18 billion in 1991, a 2.6% rise from the $8.95 billion in1990.   Some analysts assert that Salomon's stumble is temporary.Two big Salomon clients, the World Bank and the CaliforniaPublic Employees Retirement System, recently resumed businessties with the investment bank. And Salomon recently picked upmarket share in the underwriting rankings after slumping lastyear.   &quot;This shows the firm is starting to get their businessback,&quot; said Guy Moszkowski, an analyst at Sanford C.Bernstein andamp; Co., who currently has a buy recommendation onSalomon's stock.   Meanwhile, Salomon continues to be buffeted by defectionswithin its stock and investment banking operations, followingthe firm's decision to grant sharply lower year-end bonuses.The latest to leave is George Balduzzi, Salomon's head stockblock trader and a managing director, who left this week forrival First Boston Corp. The desertions come as Salomon hascut the power of its stock and investment banking groupswhile returning to its roots as a powerful bond house.   But in a recent speech to Salomon clients, Mr. Buffettsaid it &quot;is unthinkable that we would reduce our long-termcommitment to either investment banking or equities,&quot; addingthat both groups are &quot;integral&quot; to Salomon. &quot;Through no faultof their own,&quot; Mr. Buffett said, both operations &quot;were hitvery hard by the events of last year, and it will take timeto restore them fully to the vitality they had before theproblem.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
