HIDLAY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Beatrice Co. is looking for a new chairman andDonald P. Kelly may be in the market for some new corporatedealmaking.   Kelly, a reknowned takeover artist, is resigning as Beatrice'schairman, the company announced Tuesday, as the company movesfurther from megabuck wheeling and dealing to focus on running itsthree main foodmaking companies.   Frederick B. Rentschler, 49, Beatrice's president and chiefexecutive officer since June 1987, will continue running theprivately-held company on a daily basis.   Kelly, 66, still will play a role as a director and majorinvestor in Beatrice, but several analysts see his resignation,effective Oct. 1, as a sign Kelly wants to deal himself back intothe high-stakes game of corporate mergers and acquisitions.   ``I think Kelly was put on this earth to do deals and I thinkhis leaving just reflects that he wants to get back in the game,''said John McMillin, a food industry analyst with Prudential-BacheSecurities Inc. in New York.   McMillin noted that Beatrice also is losing two key managersbrought on board by Kelly _ J.S. Corcoran, 45, senior vicepresident of finance, and William E. Reidy, 57, senior vicepresident of strategic planning.   ``The fact that he took his top financial guy and his topoperating guy with him indicates to me that they'll be looking foranother company to run,'' McMillin said. ``Kelly likes to playpoker. Kelly likes to do deals. He's not going to Florida to retireand play golf.''   Liz Sode, Beatrice's vice president of corporate relations, saidKelly was not available for comment Tuesday. She also said she didnot know, and would not speculate on, his future plans.   In a statement released by the company, Kelly said: ``We havehelped shape Beatrice into a successful, highly focused,top-quality consumer products company and accomplished this at afaster pace than we had originally planned. Today our operatingunits have better market shares and better overall operatingprofits'' than before a $6.2 billion leveraged buyout engineered byKelly in 1986.   Reporting directly to Renstschler will be the chiefs ofBeatrice's three major foodmaking companies: Albert J. Crosson,president and chief executive officer of Beatrice Hunt-Wesson Inc.;Lee O. Lochmann, president and chief executive officer ofSwift-Eckrich Inc.; and Robert H. Burns, president and chiefexecutive officer of Beatrice Cheese Inc.   ``This transition from Don to Fred really is in keeping withBeatrice's focus as an operating company now and with the fact thatit's no longer going to be involved in restructuring andacquisitions,'' Ms. Sode said. ``Don's forte, of course, has beenin the dealmaking.''   The 1986 leveraged buyout that took Beatrice private, withfinancial backing from the New York investment firm of KohlbergKravis Roberts andamp; Co., was one of the biggest such deals in U.S.corporate history.   In a leveraged buyout, a company is acquired mainly withborrowed funds that are repaid with the target company's cash flowor with money raised by the sale of its assets.   Since the buyout, Beatrice has sold more than $7 billion inassets, including its Tropicana Products fruit juice division,Beatrice International, E-II Holdings Inc. group of companies, andits bottled water division.   The company still produces such products as Hunt tomato sauce,Orville Redenbacher popcorn, La Choy Oriental foods, Butterballturkeys and County Line cheeses.   Kelly was chairman, president and chief executive of Esmark,which made Swift meats and Hunt-Wesson products, when it wasacquired by Beatrice in 1984 after a bidding war with KohlbergKravis. He then left to form his own company before turning thetables and negotiating the Beatrice buyout in 1986 for a totalpurchase price and financing of $8.4 billion, the company said.   In the fiscal year ended Feb. 29, Beatrice had net sales of$4.01 billion, but reported a loss from continuing operations of$105 million because of remaining debt from the buyout, Ms. Sodesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
