It has suspended its dividend,announced the dismissal of 1,000 workers and posted lossesfor each of the last two years.   Not everyone is complaining, though. Last year, Shawmutdecided to guarantee the pensions for its top executives,paying $38 million into a special fund that will remain safeno matter what the future holds for the bank.</LP><TEXT>   Pension guarantees are the latest twist in executivecompensation. Seeking to protect executive pensions in anyeventuality -- from hostile takeovers to bankruptcies -- asmall but growing number of companies have quietly adoptedsome type of guarantee. And while many companies have comeunder fire over executive pay levels and lucrative stockoptions, pension perks have gone practically unnoticed.   Pension protections are &quot;another of the chamber of horrorsof executive compensation, just more subtle than most,&quot; saysRobert Monks, a shareholder activist and president of theInstitutional Shareholder Partners Inc. Indeed, it's oftendifficult to decipher disclosures about pensions even whenthey are included in proxy materials. &quot;People fixate ondirect cash compensation, and the pension stuff just slipsby,&quot; says Ralph Whitworth of the United ShareholdersAssociation.   Companies defend the practice, saying it protectsexecutives and retirees from losing benefits they haveearned. Given the turmoil in the banking system, Shawmutsays, the move &quot;is a key element in attracting and retainingtalented people.&quot;   The exact number of companies adopting pension protectionsisn't known. But compensation experts estimate that about 50major companies have set up fully guaranteed executivepensions. Moreover, Executive Compensation Reports, whichtracks compensation at the nation's 1,200 largest companies,says that 18% now have golden parachutes attached to pensionsthat are triggered by takeovers or failures, up from just 6%in 1987.   The reason for the protection is that the EmployeeRetirement Income Security Act, or ERISA, limits federalpension guarantees to $108,963 a year. But that is lower thansome executive pensions, which tend to be about half the paylevel of an executive's top five years of earning.   Most companies, of course, have no trouble payingexecutive pensions over $108,963, even though the amountisn't guaranteed. But executive pensions can be at risk whenthings turn sour.   &quot;The companies that are usually most interested in doingthis are the ones that are in some trouble and worried abouttheir future -- that's the whole point,&quot; says Stephen Hall ofPearl Meyer andamp; Partners, executive compensation specialists inNew York. He adds that the guarantees are warranted to keeptop executives.   Shawmut, based in Hartford, Conn., adopted its executivepension guarantee after seeing problems build at Bank of NewEngland Corp., which was seized by federal regulators inJanuary. It was clear early in 1990 that Bank of New Englandexecutives would lose any pension payments they had accruedabove the ERISA limit if the bank failed.   Shawmut's capital exceeds minimum regulatory requirements,and its management maintains that the bank has a solidfuture. But to fully protect the so-called supplementarypension above the ERISA guaranteed level, Shawmut set aside$38 million.   In addition to keeping current executives, says Shawmutspokesman Anthony Zehnder, the company wanted to &quot;giveretirees peace of mind and eliminate concerns about possiblechanges or payment reductions in their various retirementplans.&quot;   Like Shawmut, Gulf States Utilities Co. of Beaumont,Texas, which provides electricity to parts of Texas andLouisiana, has posted losses in its last two fiscal years. Acompany spokeswoman concedes that Gulf States suspended itsdividend in 1986, the year it also cashed in insurancepolicies to create a guaranteed fund, now holding $5.1million, to pay pensions for top executives if the company istaken over or fails. In January, the company created anotherguaranteed fund -- also fail-safe -- containing $11.3 millionfor severance payments to the company's top 22 officers.   For a company that has &quot;periodically been on the verge ofbankruptcy,&quot; says Guillermo Garcia, spokesman for the TexasPublic Utilities Commission, &quot;allocating this kind of moneyfor top officers is a tad peculiar.&quot; Gulf States officialsdeclined to comment.   ConAgra Inc., an agricultural concern based in Omaha,Neb., is gradually making payments into a guaranteed pensionfund that it doesn't expect to be fully protected for atleast a decade. Currently, the fund contains $3.8 million tocover pensions of close to 100 executives. &quot;We just had noreal appetite for fully funding it,&quot; says Donald Winters,director of employee services. &quot;We choose not to be thatbrazen.&quot;   A few companies have even set up guaranteed funds forpension payments to directors. Greater New York Savings Bank,for instance, has set aside a fund -- protected in the caseof a takeover -- containing $3.5 million for directors'pensions. It gives retired directors pensions of $24,000 ayear -- the same amount active directors get paid. The $3billion-asset savings bank posted a $15.6 million loss in1990 and a $9.7 million loss in this year's first quarter.&quot;There is a lot of consolidation going on in the bankingindustry,&quot; says the bank's attorney, Bob Carlson. &quot;Banksaround us were doing this sort of thing, so we did it too.&quot;   &quot;It would seem that executives with these types ofparachutes wouldn't have the same incentive to keep a companyafloat as those without,&quot; says Robert Walton, an officer withthe California Public Employees Retirement System, which hasa major institutional stake in Shawmut. &quot;What does he care?Even if the company fails, he gets his money.&quot;   Seeking to avoid criticism, some companies haveestablished pensions that are protected in case of a changein control but not in the case of bankruptcy. &quot;If the companygoes bust, shareholders are wiped out and creditors are lefthanging. It's tough to justify why current managementshouldn't make do&quot; on a pension of $108,963 a year, saysDavid Wright, corporate counsel at Cummins Engine Co.   Cummins did, however, adopt a &quot;change of control&quot; pensionprovision in 1988 -- when the company began to worry about ahostile takeover. The engine maker, headquartered inColumbus, Ind., has posted net losses in four of the pastfive years, including a $137.7 million net loss for 1990. Mr.Wright justifies the company's current provision, saying thatexecutives shouldn't suffer because a company is taken over.   Still, even protecting pensions in case of takeovers canprovoke criticism. Takeover triggers &quot;may offer incentives totop executives that are not necessarily in the interest ofshareholders or most employees,&quot; says Judith Fischer,publisher of Executive Compensation Reports. Executives mightbe more inclined to approve a takeover, she notes, becausethey could receive a lump sum pension payment of severalmillion dollars.   Some companies seek to avoid criticism by not publicizingtheir pension guarantees. Ethan Kra, a managing director ofWilliam M. Mercer Inc., a New York-based actuarial firm, saysthat one recent client, a large, privately heldcommunications company, bought annuities to create aprotective fund for its pensions and then forced theinsurance company to sign confidentiality agreementsconcerning the purchase.   The company &quot;just thought the funding would send out thewrong signals,&quot; says Mr. Kra. &quot;They just wanted to be safe.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
