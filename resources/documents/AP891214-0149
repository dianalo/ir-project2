REID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Assailants Thursday fired two riflegrenades into an American housing and recreation compound, causingno injuries and only minor damage, U.S. officials said.   The attack came a week after a bloody coup attempt that left atleast 113 people dead was thwarted with help of U.S. war jets.   Later, a grenade exploded at the house of an unidentifiedAmerican diplomat in Manila's Makati financial district, the U.S.Embassy said. One Filipino workman who was repairing the roof wasslightly injured.   The army said more security patrols had been set up near theseaside compound and the U.S. Embassy, 2{ miles to the north.   Embassy spokesman David Andriessen said the device that explodedat the house could have been fired last week during coup-associatedfighting, not intentionally planted.   The U.S. Embassy denounced Thursday's attack on the Seafrontcompound as a ``cowardly act'' by ``terrorists'' who could havekilled some of the hundreds of Americans who live and work in thecompound, which includes the American Club, sports field,commissary and housing for government employees.   Police said four cars were damaged when the grenades explodednear the U.S. military post office and near an apartment complexfor U.S. families.   President Corazon Aquino telephoned U.S. Ambassador NicholasPlatt to assure him that Philippine authorities would take allmeasures to protect Americans.   There was no claim of responsibility, but Brig. Gen. AlexanderAguirre, chief of the police Capital Command, said the attackerscould have been rebel soldiers who launched a coup attempt againstMrs. Aquino on Dec. 1.   The incident followed threats against U.S. interests by rebelsoldiers after U.S. F-4 Phantom jets flew air cover for governmentforces during the coup attempt, which ended Saturday.   Police said five armed men were seen abandoning a van near thecompound soon after the attack. Inside the van, police found aplastic container for a rifle grenade with serial numbers identicalto those on a grenade fragment recovered on the compound.   The owner of the van, Armando Pantaleon, told troops that threemen with .45-caliber pistols had taken his van at gunpoint about anhour before the attack.   ``The terrorists involved clearly did not care if they harmedinnocent civilians, including women, children and men,'' Platt saidin a statement.   Americans were warned to stay away from the U.S. Embassy andother U.S. facilities ``in the immediate future.'' The U.S.military banned non-essential travel to Manila by the 40,000 U.S.troops, military dependents and civilian employees at the six U.S.military bases north and west of the capital.   Authorities say about half the estimated 3,000 troops who tookpart are still at large.   On Wednesday, Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos said remnants of therebel force still retain the capability to launch ``terroristattacks, sabotage and assassination.''   Two people were killed and 18 injured when an assailant threw agrenade Saturday into Manila's main post office.   In other developments, the government's intelligence chief toldthe Senate Intelligence Oversight Committee on Thursday that rebelswere planning another move against the government to be launched inthe central Visayas islands and on Mindanao island.   Rodolfo Canieso, chief of the National Intelligence CoordinatingAgency, said 60 percent of the 160,000-member armed forces wouldaccept whatever government emerged victorious in a future coup.   Canieso, a retired major general and former army commander,warned that the entire Philippine society was ``in a state offlux.''   A joint legislative committee late Thursday approved acompromise bill granting Mrs. Aquino emergency powers for sixmonths. The committee will refer the new bill to the Senate andHouse of Representatives on Monday. Both chambers had approveddiffering versions of the emergency bill.   Mrs. Aquino declared an indefinite state of emergency Dec. 6 andthis week asked Congress to grant specific powers under thedeclaration.</TEXT></DOC>
