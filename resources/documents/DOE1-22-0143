<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-22-0143 </DOCNO><TEXT>The calculated electron energy spectrum obtained by numerical simulationof three-dimensional particle dynamics in the assumption of a {delta}-likespectrum of the magnetron is compared with the experimental one measuredby a spectrum analyzer. The effect of instabilities of the magnetronfrequency and amplitude of high-frequency power pulse on the electronspectrum width at the electron linac output is discussed. It is shownthat if the calculated spectrum is considered to be instantaneous thespectrum width can be determined by integration over the whole rangeof average energy variation of particles as close as it is observed inthe experiment. The measurements and calculations are made for the LUEh-8-5Vlinac. 7 references, 7 figures.</TEXT></DOC>
