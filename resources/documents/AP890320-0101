He and 10 other members of a Soviet inspection team in Utah underprovisions of a 1987 nuclear arms reduction treaty were invited tothe parade's reviewing stand in one of many appearances sponsored byUtahans eager to foster international goodwill.   ``I sang `Danny Boy,''' he said in an interview at the apartmentcomplex that is home to the 26-member contingent maintaining around-the-clock vigil at Hercules Aerospace's missile manufacturingplant.   Orekhovsky was public relations officer for the team, whosemembers serve six-week tours before rotating back to the SovietUnion.   But until he left for home Monday, his movements, like those ofall the Soviet inspectors who will be in Utah for the next 13 years,were under the strict supervision of the U.S. On-Site InspectionAgency.   It's a control many Utah peace activists want relaxed.   Since the original team arrived last July, the Soviets have beenwarmly received in classrooms and at sporting and cultural events.   Team commander Nickolay Shabalin, speaking through aninterpreter, recalled the ``special satisfaction'' of seeing BalletWest, a regional professional ballet company, perform ``AnnaKarenina,'' and a local exhibit of paintings by Soviet children.   But Shabalin emphasized the Soviets' principal duty is to ensurethat no Pershing II missile motors banned under theIntermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty leave Hercules. The companystopped producing the motors in 1986 and none are stockpiled here.   ``One should not get the wrong impression that the Sovietinspectors came here as tourists,'' said Orekhovsky. ``The mostimportant reason that we arrive here is the verification of thetreaty.''   Eight-man squads serve 24-hour shifts at a checkpoint by anentrance to the Hercules complex in western Salt Lake Valley,inspecting outgoing vehicles and patrolling a road surrounding theformer Pershing building. They work one day, then have two days off.   ``The work of monitoring is not very complicated, but it is veryresponsible,'' Shabalin said.   Under terms of the treaty, the visitors may not travel without anAmerican escort or or go more than 31 miles from Hercules. The sameconditions apply to U.S. inspectors at a similar plant in the Sovietcity of Votkinsk.   The inspectors have been tireless in accepting invitations topublic forums. They say they don't chafe under the rigid rulesgoverning their excursions, but the same can't be said for some oftheir hosts.   Edwin Firmage, a University of Utah law professor andanti-nuclear activist, and Rosemary Holt, president of WomenConcerned About Nuclear War, are trying to persuade the inspectionagency to allow the inspectors to accept dinner invitations atprivate homes.   Both believe the agency's denial of private visits, for securityreasons, is without merit, especially since the Soviets haveappeared so often in public.   When the first group of Soviets arrived, some were permitted toattend barbecues at a couple of private homes before the policy waschanged, Holt said.   ``We saw that not only as an opportunity lost for the citizens ofUtah, but for the Soviets to know us in a personal way,'' she said.``There's a difference between sitting down with a cup of coffee, asopposed to speeches _ a world of difference.''   ``We must see each other fundamentally in our common humanness,''Firmage said. ``The overwhelming, transcending reality is that weare human beings.''   Inspection agency spokeswoman Mary Wilson, declined to discussdetails but said security is paramount.   There are other considerations, she said. ``If you get to whereyou're accepting some, but not others, you get into a discriminationproblem,'' she said.   Shabalin, vice director of the National Nuclear Risk ReductionCenter in Moscow, avoids any appearance of taking sides.   ``The solution of this question rests with the proper Americanauthorities,'' he said. ``Its positive or negative solution doesn'taffect in any way the accomplishment of the mission we have.''</TEXT></DOC>
