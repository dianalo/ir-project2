Rejects $40-a-Share Offer By Mark IV Industries </HL><SO> </SO><CO> ARM IV </CO><IN> TNM AUT </IN><DATELINE> NEW HAVEN, Conn.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Armtek Corp., as expected, rejected as &quot;inadequate&quot; a $430 million, or $40 a share, tender offer from Mark IV Industries Inc.    The auto-parts concern said it is considering &quot;all available alternative plans intended to enhance shareholder values.&quot; Among those alternatives, it added in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, was possibly entering into talks with certain unnamed third parties that had expressed interest in a merger.    Armtek said, however, that remaining independent would be &quot;a superior alternative&quot; to accepting West Amherst, N.Y.-based Mark IV's offer. One way to do that, Armtek indicated, was a leveraged recapitalization plan, in which a company typically piles on additional debt to finance a big one-time payout to shareholders.    Officials at Mark IV declined to comment on the filing.    In addition, Armtek's board said it deferred until Aug. 30 the date on which certain deferred stock purchase rights -- part of Armtek's anti-takeover defenses -- are to become triggered by the Mark IV offer.    In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, Armtek closed at $44.25, up 50 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
