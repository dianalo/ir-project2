For a decade, Intel Corp. has dominated the market forthese brainy chips and has profited handsomely as demandboomed for personal computers using Intel-designed chips.Motorola Inc.'s chips have been a distant second, the chipsof choice for engineers' computers and for Apple's Macintosh.</LP><TEXT>   But now a new breed of fast chips is threatening to bringa change of guard, and to create a new set of winners andlosers in the computer market. The new chips use a technologycalled reduced-instruction-set computing, or Risc, a termused to describe a set of techniques for laying out circuitryso that chips can perform calculations faster than with oldermethods. Risc chips are rapidly winning favor with computermakers because the chips offer far more speed at lower pricesthan older chips offer.   The power of Risc chips is showing up in the market. SunMicrosystems Inc., an early leader in Risc chips, has quicklygained No. 1 share of the workstation market using its Riscchip. And Sun is making inroads into PC turf with low-costRisc workstations. Hewlett-Packard Co. unveiled a machineusing its own Risc chip in March that runs as much as 10times faster than similarly priced systems using Intel'slatest chip.   Intel-designed chips still go into 80% of the PCs soldworld-wide, and the PC market is still 10 times bigger thanthe workstation market. But computer makers see in Risc chipsan opportunity to recarve the computer-market pie.   The big gamble: which of a half-dozen Risc chips tochoose. Compaq Computer Corp. has formed a loose alliancewith Digital Equipment Corp. and others that sided with aRisc chip designed by start-up Mips Computer Systems Inc.Toshiba Corp. and several Taiwanese clone makers have chosenSun's chip. Hitachi Ltd. sides with HP's chip; Data GeneralCorp. has chosen Motorola's, while IBM uses its own.   The name of the game for the Risc-chip makers is to woo acritical mass of computer makers; those who fail to winallies will become also-rans, locked out of big-volumemarkets. The game for computer makers is to bet which chipwill garner the most other computer makers, the most softwareand the most users; those that bet on the wrong chip will beleft with warehouses full of machines that no one wants.
