Bush said he would let Mayor Marion Barry evaluate the crisis andarrive at his own proposals to rid the city of its distinction asmurder capital of the United States. Most of the 120 killings thisyear have been linked to the drug trade.   The president said the city needs help, ``and that's one of thereasons that (federal drug czar William) Bennett has targeted thiscity.'' He said he is awaiting Bennett's recommendations.   Asked about the sharp rise in the use of semiautomatic weapons indrug-related crimes, Bush said the entire administration is tryingdevelop a more definite policy than ``just holding up thoseimports'' of the weapons.   The government last week suspended indefinitely imports ofsemiautomatic assault rifles.   Bush noted that one policeman was killed and another was woundedin a shootout in suburban Alexandria, Va., Wednesday night with agunman who had taken five hostages after demanding crack cocaine.The gunman, identified as an escapee from a Washington halfwayhouse, died in the battle with police, which took place a few blocksfrom the home of the president's son Marvin.   ``I want to find a way to help protect the lives of the policementhat are laying their lives on the line for all of us ... as one didlast night,'' Bush said.   ``I would like to add at that point, in the enforcement side, inthe penalty side... (that) we've condoned for too long those thingswhich we should have condemned _ in drug use, in tolerance for thedrug habit, in the media of glorifying the drugs _ the entertainmentmedia ....   ``And so everybody has to think anew, including the president ofthe United States. We are in that serious a situation.''</TEXT></DOC>
