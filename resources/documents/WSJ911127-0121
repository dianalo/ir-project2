It was written by John Frost, Colonel (Ret.)USAF, in reference to your Sept. 10 page-one article &quot;GulfWar Casualty: `Friendly Fire' Downs the Soaring Career of aGung-Ho Colonel&quot; describing a fratricide incident inOperation Desert Storm in which an Army officer mistakenlyfired Hellfire missiles from his Apache helicopter atfriendly vehicles, resulting in multiple casualties.   Mr. Frost implies that this tragedy need not have happenedwere it not for the fact that &quot;Army employees at the NightVision Laboratory had a proprietary interest in their ownproducts.&quot; This claim is false and is an affront to a veryprofessional organization that over the past 20 years hasdeveloped most of the night-vision and electro-opticequipment used by the Army during the conflict in SoutheastAsia.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Frost did not identify his affiliation -- he ispresident of FFE International, which provided acost-and-delivery quote to this laboratory for theprocurement of battery-operated light sources that can beseen when using image intensification sights for nightvision. Award of the procurement for these lights was made toanother company.   However, these lights are irrelevant to the incident atissue. The Apache helicopter uses a thermal imager, not animage intensifier, as its target acquisition sight along witha boresighted laser designator to guide Hellfire missiles totheir target. This thermal sight senses radiation in the farinfrared spectral band and is not sensitive to the nearinfrared radiation that the battery-operated light sourcesdiscussed here emit.   Combat identification is a complex problem involvingtrade-offs in performance, covertness, cost and otherfactors, and no single solution exists. The Army is pursuinga number of technical approaches to solve the problem. Theimplication that it can be solved simply by buying lightsfrom FFE is preposterous.   Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, in a personal correspondence tothis organization, stated, &quot;The night vision devices providedto our forces gave them a significant advantage over theenemy. You and your dedicated employees at the Center forNight Vision and Electro-Optics can be justifiably proud ofyour significant contributions to Operations Desert Shieldand Desert Storm.&quot; There never has been nor will there everbe any instance where this organization or any of itsemployees puts &quot;proprietary interests&quot; above concern forAmerican servicemen and women.   Rudolf G. Buser   Director   U.S. Army CECOM   Night Vision and Electro-Optics Directorate   Department of the Army   Fort Belvoir, Va.   ---   Your Nov. 7 page-one story &quot;Chilling Tapes Show HowSoldiers Died in `Friendly Fire'&quot; would lead one to believesuch incidents are a new combat phenomenon, or at least thatthose &quot;responsible&quot; should now be punished after a minuteanalysis of their conduct.   The first dead American I saw in the Vietnam War was avictim of &quot;friendly fire,&quot; and I saw many more thereafter.They were killed by everything from misdirected artilleryrounds to air strikes that came a bit too close to ourpositions.   Those who try to second-guess the actions of men such asLt. Col. Ralph Hayles simply can't understand the manicbedlam and confusion of combat. Nor do they seem tounderstand that from World War II on, a sort of unwrittenU.S. tactical doctrine mandates use of massive supportingfire in virtually every tactical situation in order tominimize casualties. The doctrine is valid, as evidenced bythe minimal combat casualties in the Gulf War. But one has toacknowledge a small but inevitable tradeoff in terms of theincreased risk of falling victim to your own ordnance.   No doubt the armchair analysts would have been happier ifCol. Hayles had held fire on an Iraqi tank that then killedthe crews of a couple of U.S. armored vehicles. Perhaps thatquestion could be decided only by the plaintiff's attorney,who should accompany every rifle company into combat in ourcountry's future conflicts.   John T.
