The rollback is the largest ever ordered by a U.S. president since such privileges were first conferred to Third World nations under the Generalized System of Preferences in 1976. U.S. trade officials said the unusually large cuts resulted from a surge in some imports above the levels allowed to qualify for GSP treatment, combined with tougher eligibility standards set by recent legislation.    Taiwan will be hit hardest by the U.S. action, losing $1.6 billion in tariff exemptions. Taiwan, which racked up a $15.7 billion trade surplus over the U.S. last year, has been under pressure to redress that politically sensitive imbalance.    South Korea, Mexico, Brazil and Hong Kong will also lose large chunks of tariff preferences.    Of the imports affected by President Reagan's action, goods valued at nearly $3.8 billion are losing eligibility because they exceeded prescribed values or shares of U.S. imports. Among the products affected are wooden furniture and telephone sets from Taiwan, switchboards and auto parts from Mexico, tape recorders and data-processing equipment from South Korea, and unwrought copper from Chile.    Nearly two-thirds of the $3.8 billion in exclusions resulted from tighter standards for GSP eligibility for certain products deemed to be exceptionally competitive. Under the new GSP rules, privileges are cut off for imports of such a product from any single country if they exceed 25% of all U.S. imports of that product, or $28 million in value annually.    For other types of imports, the thresholds are 50% of all U.S. imports, or $71.4 million in value.    Another major group of imports, valued at $265 million a year, were &quot;graduated&quot; from the program because their Third World producers are deemed to have caught up with U.S. manufacturers in quality and pricing. Mr. Reagan acted on his discretionary authority to push these items out of the program, in many cases at the request of U.S. petitioners.    U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter announced that some $1.1 billion in imports that had lost eligibility in earlier GSP reviews won't be reinstated in the program. But he said the U.S. agreed to extend until Oct. 1 a deadline for considering whether to end Indonesia's GSP eligibility if that country doesn't change its laws to recognize copyrights on U.S. and other foreign products.    U.S. trade officials said the deadline was pushed back because there has been &quot;progress&quot; in negotiations with that country.    The GSP revisions are scheduled to take effect on July 1. The volume of duty-free trade isn't expected to shrink much from last year's $13.9 billion, because privileges taken away from some countries are captured by others, and new products are made eligible for the program.    A news release issued yesterday by Mr. Yeutter's office totaled the exclusions resulting from the latest GSP review at $4.7 billion. However, Mr. Yeutter's aides later acknowledged that figure included $682 million that had been counted twice -- first in the total of benefits eliminated because of prescribed import limits and then in the tally of imports &quot;graduated&quot; under Mr. Reagan's discretionary authority.    Members of Congress have been urging Mr. Reagan to use his discretionary authority more vigorously. </TEXT></DOC>
