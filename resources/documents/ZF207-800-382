(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Dennis EskowandM;Nordstrom Inc., the Seattle-based $2.3 billion general retail chain with 60stores across the nation, is a customer-driven business.andP;  It prides itself onfast-moving checkout lines and friendly service.andM;The company last year made improvements to its point-of-sale (POS) systemthat resulted in a fivefold speedup in the checkout process.andP;  Nordstrom'sdata-processing manager, Charles Mitchell, attributes the company's successto its knowing when to automate and when not to.andM;&quot;We decided not to put in an item-inventory system,&quot; Mitchell explained.andP;  &quot;Wehave more than 500 buyers in the stores, and they're supposed to know when toorder and what to order.andP;  This business is driven by people, not data.&quot;andM;This conservative approach to systems results directly from the company'sfocus on the customer rather than the process.andP;  &quot;Basically, we've edited theprocedure for ringing up a sale,&quot; Mitchell said.andP;  &quot;When the clerk is ringingup a number of items and makes a mistake, instead of having to start overagain, that line can be easily corrected.&quot; And that means faster service forNordstrom's customers.andM;'A Chilling Effect on Business'andM;The penchant for turning every procedure into an information system has&quot;actually had a chilling effect on business,&quot; said Lester Thurow, dean of theSloane School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology inCambridge.andP;  At the recent Guide International meeting in San Francisco,Thurow advised IS managers to &quot;Ask yourself, 'When is it smart to beignorant?' &quot; Just-in-time processes, Thurow said, are best handled byresponsible management at the local level, a practice embraced by Nordstrom.andM;Still, Nordstrom, whose systems are mainframe-based, is about to install anew-generation POS system that will mean greater throughput and flexibility.andO;The two-year conversion will put the system on a LAN using Unix-basedprocessors.andM;&quot;Nordstrom is all about good feeling,&quot; said analyst Lesa Sroufe offinancial-analysis firm Ragen McKenzie in Seattle.andP;  &quot;That gives them a loyalcustomer base -- and a return on investment of 21 percent.andP;  They are doingbusiness right.&quot;andM;&quot;If IS managers have to learn anything, it is centering the business on acustomer,&quot; agreed Joseph Coerreira III, IS director at The TravelersInsurance Co. in Hartford.andP;  &quot;There was a time when customers would put upwith being treated as the last part of a process they didn't understand.andP;  Ithink younger managers are PC-literate, and they won't stand for jargon andmagic.andP;  They want service.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
