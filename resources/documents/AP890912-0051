WILLIAMS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BREMEN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Chancellor Helmut Kohl has weathereda storm inside his party and won another term as ChristianDemocratic Union leader, but with the smallest majority of votes inhis 16 years as party chairman.   Kohl was elected to the new term late Monday and will be theparty's candidate for chancellor again during next year's toughelection battle.   But the 59-year-old Kohl, who will be angling for a third term ashead of the Bonn government, managed just 77 percent support fromhis own party faithful despite having no opponent in the vote forthe chairmanship.   The sizeable no-vote expressed the discord within the Kohl'sparty after numerous local election losses over the past two years.   As the West German electorate has moved to the left, thetraditionally conservative Christian Democrats have drifted towardthe center, angering their most right-wing members while doinglittle to win votes from the left.   Kohl last month fired the party's long-time manager, HeinerGeissler, triggering another intraparty dispute that reared its headMonday on the national party convention's opening day.   Geissler, architect of the party's comeback at the beginning ofthe 1980s, initially disputed his firing by claiming it signaled amove by the Christian Democrats ``in the wrong political direction.''   In an effort to put a unified face on party affairs heading intothe national election campaign, Kohl offered Geissler a job asdeputy chairman of the party _ one of eight _ and Geissler was votedinto that seat Monday night.   But some notes of discontent were voiced by moderates among the750 party delegates at the convention who saw Kohl's removal ofGeissler as high-handed or an act of desperation.   The Christian Democrats are currently running neck-and-neck withthe left-leaning Social Democrats in public opinion polls, whichgive each party about 38 percent of the vote.   That means the Christian Democrats need to retain a coalitionwith the liberal Free Democratic Party and with their Bavariansister party, the Christian Social Union, to win a majority inDecember 1990 national balloting.   The Free Democrats, which poll about 8 percent in nationalsurveys, have indicated they will make their continued alliancedependent on how the Christian Democrats fare in regional electionsover the next few months.   Christian Democrat losses this year in Berlin and Frankfurt costthe party control of those cities.   Free Democrat support among voters has also withered over thepast year, and the party blames its drop on the declining popularityof the Christian Democrats, with which it is aligned in Bonn.   Continued discord within the Christian Democratic Party,reflected in the fact that Kohl won only 571 of 738 votes for thechairmanship, could further erode the party's popularity and itschances for retaining leadership of the Bonn government next year.</TEXT></DOC>
