Measles Outbreak Prompts New Concerns Over Risks for PreschoolKids</HEAD><HEAD>Eds: For release 6 p.m. EST.</HEAD><BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   In the wake of a measles outbreak among youngchildren in California, federal health researchers said Thursdaythat intensive efforts are needed to better vaccinate preschoolersif the disease is ever to be wiped out.   Los Angeles County last year reported 513 measles cases, 18percent of the nation's total of 2,933, according to the nationalCenters for Disease Control.   Of the surveyed cases for which ages were known, 26 percent, or93 out of 353, were 16 months to 4 years _ old enough to bevaccinated, but not old enough to fall under mandatory schoolimmunization rules.   And of those 93 cases, 86 percent were considered``preventable,'' meaning the children had not been vaccinated. Theremaining 14 percent were cases where children were vaccinated butgot the measles anyway.   ``The routine age for vaccination is 15 months, but in moststates where vaccinations are required for school, you've got that4{-year period where they are not ... required to have measlesimmunization,'' said Dr. Paul Stehr-Green, a CDC measles specialist.   That age group has been a focal point for recent measlesoutbreaks in Los Angeles, Miami and other places, Stehr-Green said.``That's why this (report) is focusing on that age group. They'renot real easy to get at.''   In the late 1970s, CDC measles specialists believed the childhooddisease could be eradicated in the United States by fall 1982. Butthat goal was not met; in the past six years, between 1,497 and6,282 cases have been reported each year.   Part of the problem is what researchers call ``non-preventable''cases _ those patients who were vaccinated but still got measles,since, at best, one in 20 vaccinations does not provide fullimmunity. In the Los Angeles study, 58 percent overall wereconsidered non-preventable, the CDC said.   Researchers disagree on whether widespread vaccination of all agegroups can ever, in theory, provide the ``herd immunity'' needed tocompletely cut off the spread of measles among the ``susceptibles''whose vaccines did not work. ``Measles is very efficient at pickingoff susceptibles,'' Stehr-Green said.   But as long as large numbers of preschoolers remain unvaccinated,spreading the disease, there is no way to talk about completeeradication, he added.   In the Los Angeles outbreak, ``the large percentage ... ofvaccine-eligible patients 16 months to 4 years of age who wereunvaccinated demonstrates the need for intensive efforts to increasevaccine coverage in this hard-to-reach group,'' the Atlanta-basedCDC concluded in its weekly report.   Many of the Los Angeles cases occurred in Hispanic children fromlower-economic areas, where the quality and availability of medicalcare may not be as high, the CDC said.   ``Long-term outreach programs are needed for parents and childrenin low socioeconomic groups in urban areas,'' the agency added.   The CDC recommended removal of obstacles to immunizations byextending clinic hours, collaborations between health officials andcommunity leaders to promote vaccination, and consideration ofcommunity locations for use as temporary vaccination sites.</TEXT></DOC>
