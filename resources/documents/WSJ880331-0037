Recent employment figures have been scrutinized by the markets for clues to U.S. economic growth, and in that respect, tomorrow's data may be very important to near-term market sentiment, analysts say.    However, the data's potential impact is more difficult to judge than usual, since London and New York financial markets will be closed tomorrow.    Treasurys won't resume trading until the Tokyo market opens Monday. This, some analysts say, may mean that the London market reaction will be confined to a brief adjustment at the opening. Nevertheless, traders are expected to take neutral positions through the weekend just in case the difficult-to-forecast data produce a nasty surprise.    Dealers already were preparing for the weekend yesterday, with activity fairly light. Seasoned Eurodollar bonds ended little changed, reflecting a relative lack of movement in U.S. Treasurys by the close of the European session.    Among the few new issues offered were 150 billion lire ($121.7 million) of 10 3/8%, five-year Eurobonds by the World Bank and 500 million French francs ($88.6 million) of 9 1/8%, five-year Eurobonds by Interfinance Credit National NV, a unit of Credit National, the French credit agency.    Once again, there weren't any major new dollar issues. Analysts said there is a lack of interest in the Euromarket by borrowers, who are uncertain about the interest rate outlook, and by investors, who are concerned about the dollar's prospects.    The dollar sector doesn't seem likely to spring back to life soon, either. One reason is that market participants will be wary of exposure to dollar bond positions until it becomes clearer what strategy Japanese investors are going to take this month with the beginning of their new fiscal year.    The March U.S. employment data may play an important role in investor decisions. &quot;The employment numbers almost are beginning to assume the role in the markets that the trade figures played two and three months ago,&quot; said Dick Howard, an economist for ANZ Merchant Bank Ltd., London.    Forecasts of the monthly rise in employment appear to vary widely. &quot;The range of forecasts is as wide as ever,&quot; said George Magnus, an economist at Warburg Securities. He anticipates a rise of 225,000 in U.S. nonfarm payrolls for March but added that he has heard projections from 140,000 to 300,000.    James Capel, the London-based securities firm, estimates a somewhat higher rise of 250,000, said analyst James Watson. But, he added that past rises, especially a 531,000 payroll jump in January, may be revised downward.    Economists Sally Kleinman and Michael Jankowski of Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp. argue that employment may have been overstated in recent months. In a study released earlier in the week, they suggested that under the U.S. program of amnesty for illegal immigrants that began last May, employers may now be reporting workers who already were on payrolls illegally.    If that's actually the case, the U.S. economy may be growing at a significantly slower rate than recent employment data suggest, they said. </TEXT></DOC>
