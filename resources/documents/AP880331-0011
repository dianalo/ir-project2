DALE NELSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   It looks more and more as though PresidentReagan will leave office without achieving his stated goal ofmaking Daniel Ortega say ``Uncle.''   In the view of many Latin American experts, Reagan's policy ofkeeping the pressure on Ortega's Nicaraguan government to bringabout peace and democracy has failed.   ``You have peace, but you don't have freedom,'' says NeilPickett, an expert on national and international security affairsat the Hudson Institute in Indianapolis.   ``They're about to leave office, and they've got a Contraprogram that's falling apart on them,'' says Ed King, LatinAmerican adviser to Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd.   As G. Pope Atkins, senior associate specializing in SouthAmerican affairs at the Center for Strategic and InternationalStudies, sees it, the stated goal of the policy has kept shifting.   ``The first one was simply to interdict Nicaraguan arms to ElSalvador,'' Atkins said. ``Then it was rather strongly implied thatthe idea was to bring down the regime. And now the idea is that ifthey (Nicaragua's leaders) will change, everything will be allright.''   Marlin Fitzwater, the president's chief spokesman, says theadministration's goal remains the same: ``The situation is that weneed aid to the Contras in the worst way.''   But questions remain whether Wednesday's House vote to continuenon-lethal aid and leave the door open for military aid, and theexpected Senate vote today, will help further Reagan's objectives.   Reagan has said his goal is to keep pressure on the Sandinistasso they will live up to the promises of democratic reform that theymade when they took over from dictator Anastasio Somoza in 1979.   At a news conference Feb. 21, 1985, Reagan was asked whether hewas advocating the overthrow of the Nicaraguan government. Hisreply was: ``Not if the present government would turn around and... say, `Uncle. All right, come back into the revolutionarygovernment, and let's straighten this out and institute thegoals.'''   Now that the two sides have agreed on a cease-fire, willNicaragua's Marxist-led Sandinista government reform? And if itdoesn't, can the Contra rebels the Reagan administration has backedsurvive as an effective force?   Many think not.   ``I think it would be awfully difficult to reorganize them,''said Atkins. ``I doubt if they would be particularly interested inthat. I don't think they would want to go through the convolutionsof U.S. policy again.''   King added that ``it's over for the time being unless theSandinistas back up on what they say they are going to do, and havedone, and the Contras change their orientation from where they are,which is: let's get some kind of political opening going.''   Pickett, too, sees ``the end of the resistance'' in the latestdevelopments, ``barring some miracle or barring some violationbefore the truce is signed.''   ``If the Sandinistas do something stupid before that, theContras can be saved,'' he said.   King, the adviser to Byrd, said: ``The objective of the wholeexercise in the beginning was to protect U.S. security concerns inthe region. U.S. security concerns in the region are removal of theSoviet and the Cuban advisers, guarantees of no bases, reduction ofSoviet weapons and guarantees of no border crossing.   ``Now they are at a point where they don't have any of thosethings arranged, they're about to leave office, and they've got aContra program that's falling apart on them,'' King said. ``I thinkthe whole thing is a disaster, frankly.''   The less partisan sources are not calling it a disaster, butthey aren't proclaiming it a success either.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   W.
