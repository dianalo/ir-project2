The regulationrequires banks to make funds available to their customers within specifiedtime frames and to disclose their funds availability policies to theircustomers. A number of states have also enacted rules governing funds availability.The Act (section 608) and Regulation CC (andSection;229.20) provide thatany provision of state law in effect on or before September 1, 1989, thatprovides for a shorter hold for a category of checks than is provided underfederal law will supersede the federal provision.Provisions of state law governing funds availability that do not supersedefederal law are considered inconsistent, and are thus preempted by RegulationCC. Thus, a state law that permits a bank to make funds available for withdrawalin a longer period than permitted under Regulation CC is preempted by thatregulation. In addition, state disclosure or notice requirements concerningfunds availability related to accounts covered by Regulation CC are preemptedby the federal disclosure scheme.Regulation CC provides for Board determinations as to whether state lawrelated to the availability of funds is preempted by federal law. Thesedeterminations would be provided upon the request of a state, bank, orother interested party.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion</ITAG>The Board is publishing, for a 30-day comment period, its interpretationsof Regulation CC concerning preemption determinations with respect to thelaws of California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Mexico, and Rhode Island.<T3>Preemption of State Schedules and Exceptions.</T3> State law availabilityschedules often differ from the Regulation CC schedules with respect bothto the categories of checks to which the schedules apply and the time periodswithin which funds must be available for withdrawal. State availabilityschedules which provide for availability in a shorter period of time thanrequired under Regulation CC supersede the federal schedule.In addition to the differences between state and federal availability schedules,a number of state laws contain exceptions to the state availability schedulesthat are different from those provided under the Act and Regulation CC.Under the Board's proposed interpretations, the state exceptions continueto apply only in those cases where the state schedule is shorter than orequal to the federal schedule, and then only up to the limit permittedby the Regulation CC schedule. Where a deposit that is subject to a stateexception under a state schedule that is not preempted by Regulation CCand is also subject to a federal exception, the hold on the deposit canbe further extended under the federal exception in accordance with RegulationCC. For those categories of checks for which the state schedule is preemptedby the federal schedule, only the federal exceptions may be used. Thisapproach provides a preemption standard that can be more readily appliedby banks in states that have not received preemption determinations fromthe Board.<T3>Treatment of State Schedules that Provide for the Same Availabilityas the Federal Schedules. </T3>According to the provisions of the Act,only inconsistent state law is preempted by the Act and Regulation CC.The Board has determined that a state law requiring availability in thesame time periods as required by federal law is not inconsistent with RegulationCC. Some states have incorporated the federal schedules into their statelaw to facilitate bank compliance with a single standard while retainingstate enforcement of these requirements. Under the Board's interpretations,the only state schedules that are preempted are those that provide fora longer hold than required under Regulation CC; state schedules that providefor availability within the same time periods would not be preempted.<T3>Treatment of Deposits not Subject to Regulation CC. </T3>Certain statelaws govern the availability of deposits that are not covered by the RegulationCC schedules. For example, the availability schedules of several statesapply to ``items'' deposited to an account. The term ``item'' may encompassdeposits, such as nonnegotiable instruments, that are not subject to theRegulation CC availability schedules. The Board believes that while fundsavailability laws would be simpler if state laws applicable to items thatare not checks were preempted, states have a legitimate interest in regulatingdeposits of these items, and state laws should not be preempted with respectto these items. The Board's proposed interpretations provide that depositsnot covered by Regulation CC continue to be subject to the state law.<T3>Connecticut. </T3>Connecticut law provides availability schedules fordeposits of on us checks, in-state checks, and out-of-state checks. Thestate law also provides certain exceptions to those schedules. Generally,the state schedules and exceptions allow longer hold periods than the federalschedules and Regulation CC will preempt; however, out-of-state nonlocalchecks will continue to be governed by the shorter state schedule. Thestate schedules will also continue to apply to items such as nonnegotiableinstruments that are not covered by Regulation CC. In addition, the Connecticutlaw, including disclosure requirements, will continue to apply to accounts,such as savings and time accounts, not subject to Regulation CC. <T3>Massachusetts. </T3>Massachusetts enacted a law in July 1988 repealingits previous funds availability statute and replacing it with a requirementthat institutions make funds available for withdrawal and disclose theirfunds availability policy in accordance with the Expedited Funds AvailabilityAct and Regulation CC. Massachusetts law provides, however, that all in-statechecks are considered to be local, even though the state is included intwo check processing regions. Thus, the state law generally incorporatesthe federal law, except that state law supersedes Regulation CC to theextent that in-state nonlocal checks must be made available for withdrawalin accordance with the local schedule in Regulation CC.<T3>Rhode Island.</T3> Rhode Island law requires depository institutionsto make funds deposited by check in a personal transaction account availablefor withdrawal within certain specific periods. Different schedules applyto deposits in commercial banks and thrift institutions. The Rhode Islandstatute also provides exceptions to the schedules and requires institutionsto make certain disclosures to their customers. No portion of the RhodeIsland availability schedule supersedes the federal law.<T3>New Mexico.</T3> New Mexico's statute applies only to retail accountsand does not apply to certain instruments that are covered by RegulationCC; Regulation CC would therefore apply to accounts or instruments notcovered. New Mexico law, however, applies to time and savings accountsand is not preempted with respect to these accounts. New Mexico providesdifferent availability schedules for checks payable by banks in the samemunicipality, for in-state checks, and for out-of-state checks. For certaincategories of checks, the state schedule supersedes the federal. New Mexicolaw provides for certain exceptions to its availability schedules; thesewill continue to apply where the state schedule is not preempted by RegulationCC to the extent that the hold does not exceed the federal schedule forthat category of check. An applicable federal exception can be invokedto extend a hold beyond the federal schedule.<T3>California.</T3> California has different funds availability regulationsgoverning (1) commercial banks, (2) savings and loan associations and savingsbanks, and (3) credit unions. The state schedules are generally longerthan the Regulation CC schedules, and are thus preempted. For certain categoriesof checks, however, where the depository bank has a San Francisco or LosAngeles city routing number, the state schedule is shorter and thus supersedesthe federal schedule. With respect to items that must be given next-dayavailability, the state rules provide fewer conditions to the next-dayavailability requirement (e.g., no special deposit slips are required).Therefore, the state rules supersede the federal for these categories ofchecks. The state exceptions can be invoked only for those deposits subjectto state schedules that are shorter than or equal to the federal scheduleand then only up to the federal schedule. An applicable federal exceptionmay be used to extend the hold beyond the federal schedule. The state disclosurerules are preempted by the Regulation CC rules for all accounts subjectto Regulation CC.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 229</ITAG>Banks, Banking, Federal Reserve System.For the reasons set out in the preamble, 12 CFR Part 229 is proposed tobe amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 229_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.

Where both the depositary bank and the paying bank have routingnumbers beginning 1210 (San Francisco city) or 1220 (Los Angeles city)and are not participants in the same check clearinghouse association, fundsmust be available no later than the start of business on the third businessday after the banking day of deposit.

Where the depositary bank is a commercial bank (other than onewith a 1210 or 1220 routing number) and the paying bank is a commercialbank located in California but in a different check processing region thanthe depositary bank, the funds must be available no later than the fourthbusiness day following the day of deposit. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">5. Where the depositary bank is a commercial bank (other than onewith 1210 or a 1220 routing number) and the paying bank is an Sandamp;L ora credit union located in California but in a different check processingregion than the depositary bank, the funds must be made available by thefifth business day following the day of deposit. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">6. Where the depositary bank is an Sandamp;L and the paying bank islocated in California but in a different check processing region than thedepositary bank, the funds must be available by the fifth business dayafter the day of deposit. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">7. If the depositary bank is a credit union and the paying bank islocated in California but in a different check processing region than thedepositary bank, the funds must be made available no later than the sixthbusiness day after the day of deposit, except where the check is subjectto fifth day availability under Appendix B-1 of Regulation CC. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Permanent Schedule.</T3> Under Regulation CC, as of September 1, 1990,nonlocal checks must be made available by the opening of business on thefifth business day following the banking day of deposit, with the timeperiod adjustment for withdrawal by cash or similar means. State law requiresavailability for some checks on the fourth day, and for other checks onthe fifth day, without any time period adjustments, and the state law willtherefore supersede the federal law for such checks. The state availabilityschedules supersede the federal schedule where the depositary bank is acommercial bank and the paying bank is a California commercial bank locatedin a different check processing region than the depositary bank, in whichcase funds must be available no later than the fourth business day followingthe day of deposit. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">Next-Day Availability</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Commercial banks are required to give next-day availability foritems (other than money orders) drawn by an insured institution on itself,indorsed by the payee, and deposited into the payee's account. Credit unionsare required to give next-day availability for first-indorsed items issuedby a federally insured institution. There is no comparable requirementfor Sandamp;Ls. Accordingly: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(a) California law supersedes Regulation CC to the extent that itrequires commercial banks to provide next-day availability for cashier'schecks that are not issued for remittance purposes, and to the extent thatit does not condition next-day availability on receipt at a staffed tellerstation or use of a special deposit slip. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) Under the California rule, credit unions must provide next-dayavailability to first-indorsed items issued by any federally-insured institution.This is broader than the rule of Regulation CC, which requires next-dayavailability only for cashier's checks and teller's checks issued for remittancepurposes. State law supersedes the federal rule with respect to availabilityprovided these checks issued for other than remittance purposes. In addition,California law supersedes the federal law with respect to cashier's andteller's checks issued by federally insured institutions, since state lawdoes not condition next-day availability on receipt at a staffed tellerstation, or use of a special deposit slip. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Commercial banks, Sandamp;Ls, and credit unions in California areall required to give next-day availability to items drawn by the Stateof California or any of its departments, agencies, or political subdivisions.California law supersedes the federal law, since the state law does notcondition next-day availability on receipt at a staffed teller station,or use of a special deposit slip. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) For U.S. Treasury, State of California, and ``depositary'' checks,commercial banks are required to give next-day availability only for thoseitems that are indorsed by ``<T3>the</T3> payee and deposited into <T3>the</T3> payee's deposit account.'' (Emphasis added.) Regulation CCrequires only that these checks be deposited into ``an account held bya payee of the check.'' The California rule for commercial banks requiresidentity of parties; if a check is payable to A and B, it must be depositedinto an account held by A <T3>and </T3>B before the bank is required to give next-day availability.The federal rule does not require identity of interest; thus, a check payableto A and B will be entitled to next-day availability if deposited to A'saccount. In this case, Regulation CC preempts the state rule. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Sandamp;L and credit union rules, however, require only that thecheck be ``first-indorsed;'' there is no requirement that the depositorbe a payee, only that a second indorsement not be necessary to transfertitle to a subsequent transferee. For Sandamp;Ls and credit unions, the staterule may provide for a faster availability for these instruments than areprovided under the federal rule. The state Sandamp;L and credit union rulessupersede Regulation CC to the extent that they require availability ina shorter time than required under Regulation CC.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For deposits at nonproprietary ATMs, state law applicable to commercialbanks and Sandamp;Ls allows the depositary bank to add one business day tothe otherwise applicable schedules. No adjustment of the schedules fordeposits at nonproprietary ATMs is provided for credit unions. RegulationCC, by contrast, allows all checks deposited at nonproprietary ATMs underthe temporary schedule to be held until the seventh business day followingthe banking day of deposit. Thus, state schedules for deposits at nonproprietaryATMs supersede the federal schedule to the extent that state law requiresavailability in less than seven business days following deposit. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Exceptions to the Availability Schedules.</T3> California law providesexceptions to the state availability schedules for large deposits, newaccounts, repeated overdrafters, doubtful collectibility, foreign items,and emergency conditions. The exceptions for commercial banks, Sandamp;Ls,and credit unions are essentially identical. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In all instances where the federal availability schedule preemptsthe state availability schedule, the state exceptions do not apply. Insuch cases, the depositary bank may only invoke a federal exception. Forthose deposits to which the state availability schedule applies, however,the depositary bank may invoke a state exception and place a hold on thedeposit up to the federal availability schedule limit for that type ofdeposit. Once the federal availability schedule limit is reached, the depositarybank may further extend the hold under any of the federal exceptions thatapply to that deposit. Any time a depositary bank invokes an exceptionto extend a hold beyond the time periods otherwise permitted by law, itmust give notice of the extended hold to its customer, in accordance withandSection; 229.13(g) of Regulation CC.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">Business Day/Banking Day</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The definitions of ``banking day'' and ``business day'' in the Californiaregulations are preempted by the Regulation CC definitions of those terms.Thus, for determining the permissible hold under the California schedulesthat supersede the Regulation CC schedule, deposits are considered madeon the specified number of ``business days'' following the ``banking day''of deposit. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">Disclosures </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">California law (Cal. Fin. Code section 866.2) requires depositoryinstitutions to provide written disclosures of their general availabilitypolicies to potential customers prior to opening any deposit account. Thelaw also requires that preprinted deposit slips and ATM deposit envelopescontain a conspicuous summary of the general policy. Finally, the law requiresa depository institution to provide specific notice of the time the customermay withdraw funds deposited by check or similar instrument into a depositaccount, if the funds may not be immediately available for withdrawal.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Section 229.20(c)(2) provides that inconsistency may exist when astate law provides for disclosures or notices concerning funds availabilityrelating to accounts. The purposes of the disclosures concerning fundsavailability appear to be met by the disclosure requirements in RegulationCC. California Financial Code andSection; 866.2 is preempted, but only tothe extent that it applies to ``accounts,'' as defined in Regulation CC.The state law continues to apply to savings accounts and other accountsnot governed by Regulation CC disclosure requirements. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Connecticut </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">Background </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Board has been requested, in accordance with andSection; 229.20(d)of Regulation CC (12 CFR Part 229), to determine whether the ExpeditedFunds Availability Act and Subpart B, and, in connection therewith, SubpartA of Regulation CC, preempt provisions of Connecticut law relating to theavailability of funds. This preemption determination specifies those provisionsof the Connecticut funds availability law that supersede the Act and RegulationCC. (See also the Board's preemption determination regarding the UniformCommercial Code, section 4-213(5), pertaining to availability of cash deposits.)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In 1987, Connecticut amended its statute governing funds availability(Conn.

Exceptions to the schedules are provided for items receivedfor deposit for the purpose of opening an account and for items that thedepositary bank has reason to believe will not clear. The longer hold periodfor items subject to an exception is undefined. The Connecticut statutealso requires availability policy disclosures to depositors in the formof written notices and notices posted conspicuously at each branch. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">Coverage</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Connecticut statute governs the availability of funds depositedin savings and time accounts, as well as ``accounts'' as defined in andSection;229.2(a) of Regulation CC.
