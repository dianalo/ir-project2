The decree says the special police, attached to the InteriorMinistry, will be responsible for keeping public order atdemonstrations, which have become more frequent under Soviet leaderMikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or greater openness.   It gives them the power to enter homes and businesses in pursuitof suspects, seize autos and communications equipment and use awide range of weapons.   Crowd control previously was the responsibility of regularpolice, who also are governed by the Interior Ministry. Theparamilitary police until now had been assigned only to guardingprisons and labor camps, and protecting government property andspecial shipments.   The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet approved the decree July 28,and it was published in a legislative digest that reachedsubscribers Friday.   Soviet media have not reported the measure, signed by PresidentAndrei Gromyko, but carried extensive dispatches on a decree of thesame day that requires advance permission for public demonstrationsand meetings and sets stiff fines and jail terms for violators.   Political activists say the paramilitary police turned up at ademonstration Sunday in Moscow and during this year's unrest inArmenia.   ``In peacetime, the army is taking on extraordinary powers,''said Yuri Mityunov, a leader of an unofficial opposition politicalgroup called the Democratic Union. ``What is happening here is whathappens in other countries only under martial law.''   Mityunov said the new measure gives paramilitary police _ notregular police _ jurisdiction for the first time over politicalmeetings and demonstrations.   Dissident journalist Sergei Grigoryants said unprovoked beatingsat Sunday's protest were unprecedented in recent times.   On Sunday, the paramilitary police helped regular police stop aDemocratic Union protest in Moscow's Pushkin Square against theSoviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia 20 years ago.   They wore khaki uniforms without insignias, black boots andberets with Interior Ministry markings. More than 100 protesterswere arrested and dissidents said the paramilitaries beat andkicked about 30 of them.   Mityunov said some members of the force told those arrested theyhad served in the Soviet army in Afghanistan.   Paramilitary police units were reported in Armenia as early asFebruary, months before the decree. They helped quelldemonstrations by Armenians demanding the annexation ofNagorno-Karabakh, a predominantly Armenian region attached to theneighboring republic of Azerbaijan.   Under the decree, paramilitary police need not obtain a searchwarrant from a prosecutor, as regular police are required to do.Mityunov said this violates a constitutional provision ofinviolability of the home.   Gorbachev told a special Communist Party conference June 28there should be ``strict observance of the rights of citizens tothe inviolability of their private life, home, the secrecy oftelephone communication, postal and telegraph correspondence.''   On Friday, Mityunov said: ``Gorbachev ... called for creation ofa state based on laws, but even in the times of (Soviet dictatorJosef) Stalin there weren't laws that openly violated theconstitution, such as this one does regarding inviolability.''   The decree says the paramilitary police will be used to stopviolations of public order that have a ``mass character,'' threatenpeople's lives and health, disrupt businesses and damage property.</TEXT></DOC>
