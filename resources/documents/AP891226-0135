Six traffickers died and five hostages were injured in thebloody rescue operation Monday night.   Also Monday in Salgar, a town 167 miles north of Bogota, a groupof unidentified men massacred six farmers, the Antioquia stategovernor's office reported Tuesday.   An official communique said authorities still had not determinedthe motive for the mass killing, and that no arrests had been made.Right-wing death squads have killed scores of other peasants in thesame part of Colombia the last year.   Later Monday, two police officers were assassinated, apparentlyby members of Colombia's largest and oldest guerrilla group in LaVega, a town 260 miles south of Bogota, the Cauca state governor'soffice reported.   The assassinations apparently were carried out by theRevolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the communique said. Theleftist guerrilla group has increased its activity in recentmonths. Last Saturday, members of the group ambushed an army patroland killed 10 soldiers in rural eastern Colombia.   The Bogota prison takeover ended Monday when police gained therelease of all the hostages, including two children. A JusticeDepartment spokesman told The Associated Press the situation at LaPicota jail in southern Bogota had returned to normal.   Authorities had been negotiating for two days with theprisoners, who took the hostages after a failed jailbreak Sunday.   After subduing guards during visiting hours, the inmates, alljailed on drug trafficking charges, put on guards' uniforms in anattempt to escape, Bogota's El Tiempo newspaper reported Tuesday.   Authorities discovered the plan and sealed off the cell blockbefore the prisoners could flee, El Tiempo said, citing prisonsources.   The paper added that the cornered criminals then took hostages,including civilians who had been visiting their jailed familymembers.   The prisoners initially protested the killing by police ofGonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, El Tiempo said. The Medellin cartel leaderwas slain Dec. 15 in a gunfight with police on Colombia's northerncoast.   As a condition for the hostages' release, the inmates demandedthat the administration of President Virgilio Barco end itsextradition of drug traffickers, El Tiempo said.   The administration has sent 11 drug suspects to the UnitedStates since last August when it decreed the policy.   The uprising is the second by drug traffickers at a Bogota jailin less than a week. Five prisoners died last Tuesday in a knifebattle between rival groups of convicted traffickers at anotherprison facility in the capital.</TEXT></DOC>
