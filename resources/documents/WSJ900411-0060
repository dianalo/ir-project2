This is an appropriateoccasion to give a moment's thought to environmental law -- amushrooming shadow tax code that shapes investment decisions,productivity and job-formation. Consider only the new CleanAir Act: The 600-page Senate bill (some version of which willbecome the law) would impose a &quot;tax&quot; of more than $21 billionper year. The Environmental Protection Agency -- a greenversion of the Internal Revenue Service -- will send hitherswarms of officers to issue permits, shut down factories, andimpose hefty fines.   But there's a big difference. The Tax Code is actually alaw. Tax rules bind you, and they bind the IRS. Environmental&quot;law&quot; is more like a plan than like a law. We &quot;plan&quot; theenvironment the way Albania &quot;plans&quot; its economy.</LP><TEXT>   Suppose the IRS Code looked like this:                                                                                                          Section 1. The IRS shall raise $1.4 trillion by April 15,1991. The IRS shall propose and adopt all necessaryregulations.                                                                                                          It's unlikely anyone would prefer such a law to the taxtables and forms that we all know and love. IRS rules and taxtables inform every citizen in advance how much he will owethe government; they ensure that citizens will be treatedequally; and they curb arbitrary government action. A revenuegoal (like the fictitious Section 1) has none of theseadvantages.   But Section 1 is how the EPA operates. The core of almostevery environmental statute is a collection of &quot;goals&quot; and&quot;deadlines&quot; the EPA has to attain. The rules of the game arelargely made up by the EPA (or by courts) along the way.                                                                                                          Section 2. If the IRS fails to raise $1.4 trillion byApril 15, 1990, anyone may sue the IRS Commissioner andrequest appropriate relief. The court may order the agency totake whatever steps are necessary to meet statutory goals.                                                                                                          Most of us would consider such a tax law preposterous(it's not the business of malcontents to go to court and tellthe government how to run its business) and a bit scary(private citizens would be able to go to court and force thegovernment to coerce other citizens).   Yet every federal environmental statute except one hassuch a &quot;citizen suit provision.&quot; The purpose? Congress lovesto huff and puff about clean air, clean water and the like.But when it comes to the truly tough decisions -- who will behurt and how much -- Congress would rather pass the buck.Here's how it works:   -- Congress intentionally sets the goals and deadlines(&quot;Section 1&quot;) so that the EPA cannot possibly reach them.That way, there are always dozens of missed goals anddeadlines.   -- Next, environmental groups pick a goal they would liketo see enforced, and run to court to demand enforcement.That's a lawsuit they can't lose.   -- Next, the court orders the EPA to &quot;get serious&quot; andsometimes imposes a plan of its own. A sensible way todetermine environmental priorities? No. More likely, a way ofdodging responsibility.   The EPA can do things under a court order it could neverdo on its own: shut down factories, impose transportationcontrol plans that tell you where and when you may use yourcar, and demand cleanups that cost enormous sums of money.When someone complains, it's &quot;Sorry, we're under a courtorder.&quot;   Congress gets a free ride. After all, it's not Congressbut a federal judge who's curtailing transport and banninghairspray and barbecue lighters.                                                                                                          Section 3. All private tax records shall be open to thepublic. If citizen A believes that citizen B has failed topay his taxes in full, A can sue B on the government's behalfand demand payment of taxes and fines. Citizen A shall bereimbursed by B for his attorney's fees, and A shall bepermitted to collect and retain, for his private use, anymoney B owes the government.                                                                                                          Environmental laws are enforced in this manner -- usuallyby environmental advocacy groups. In this way, environmentalorganizations have collected tens of millions of dollars fortheir pet projects.   If this principle of environmental law were applied acrossthe board, there would be no more need to wrangle subsidiesout of Congress. Citizens for Mass Transit could writetickets for speeding and parking violations and use the moneyto expand the subway system. Tenants could assess and collectfines for building-code violations and buy themselves acondo. And the Tax Code could be enforced by your neighbor,your employer or employee, your estranged cousin -- anyfellow citizen.                                                                                                          Section 4. Private property may be taken, for just aboutany use or none at all, without compensation.                                                                                                          Let's say you bought a piece of land, not knowing that itcontained hazardous waste. The EPA may declare your land atoxic waste site and send you a &quot;PRP letter.&quot; That means youare a &quot;potentially responsible party&quot; (although you neverpolluted). It also means your land is worthless, your creditdries up, and you may owe megabucks.   Or let's say you own a piece of land zoned for industrialuse and want to build a plant or factory. Under the Clean AirAct, the EPA may declare your city or county a&quot;non-attainment&quot; area. That may mean a construction ban onyour property, and everyone else's.   To say that these arbitrary and coercive instruments areneeded to protect the environment is like saying that the IRSshould be a lot more arbitrary because we really need therevenue. The only advantage of environmental &quot;law&quot; may bethat it puts the hassle of tax filings and even the dreadedIRS audit into perspective: Compared to environmental law,the Tax Code is a veritable bill of rights.   ---   Mr. Greve is executive director of the Center forIndividual Rights, a public-interest law firm in Washington,D.C.</TEXT></DOC>
