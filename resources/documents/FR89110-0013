Title III, section203 of that act states:<ITAG tagnum="74">``SEC. 203. Aircraft Collision Avoidance Systems</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">``(a) Findings._Congress finds that_</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) the number of near midair collisions is an indication that additionalmeasures must be taken to assure the highest level of air safety in theUnited States;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) public health and safety requirements necessitate the timely completionand installation of a collision avoidance system for use by commercialaircraft flying in the United States;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) the Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System promises to reducethe threat to life caused by midair collisions, particularly collisionsbetween general aviation aircraft and commercial aircraft;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) the Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System will succeedonly to the degree that other aircraft posing a collision threat use operatingtransponders with automatic altitude reporting capability; and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(5) the Federal Aviation Administration should continue at a deliberatepace the development of additional technologies, including the collisionavoidance system known as TCAS III, to ensure the safe separation of aircraft.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">``(b) General Rules._Section 601 is amended by adding at the end thefollowing new subsection:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(f) Collision Avoidance Systems._</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Development and Certification._</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(A) Standards._The Administrator shall complete development of thecollision avoidance system known as TCAS II so that such system will beoperable under visual and instrument flight rules and will be upgradeableto the performance standards applicable to the collision avoidance systemknown as TCAS III.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(B) Schedule._The Administrator shall develop and implement a schedulefor development and certification of the collision avoidance system knownas TCAS II which will result in completion of such certification not laterthan 18 months after the date of the enactment of this subsection.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Installation._The Administrator shall require by regulation that,not later than 30 months after the date of certification of the collisionavoidance system known as TCAS II, such system be installed and operatedon each civil aircraft which has a maximum passenger capacity of more than30 seats and which is used to provide air transportation of passengers,including intrastate air transportation of passengers.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Airport and Airway Safety and Capacity Expansion Act of 1987, Pub.L. 100-223, section 203 (December 30, 1987).</ITAG>The FAA has informed Congress that a schedule requiring a ``complete''certification of TCAS II equipment within 18 months is extremely difficultbecause of the different equipment manufacturer designs to be approved;the number of different aircraft types and models; and the large numberof commercial carriers requesting approval. Currently, the FAR requirethat operators apply for a separate supplemental type certificate for eachequipment manufacturer's design and each type/model aircraft. Since theultimate goal of Congress is clearly the actual installation of TCAS, theFAA is promulgating this rule to require the air carriers to install thesystem prior to the 48-month overall deadline. Therefore, after considerationof the legislation and the particular circumstances, the FAA concludedthat these amendments requiring certification and installation of TCASwithin 48 months from the date of enactment of Pub. L. 100-223 (December30, 1987) constitute compliance with that amendment to the FA Act. Public Law 100-223 also mandated an FAA regulation requiring the use ofaltitude-encoding transponders in certain airspace and terminal areas.An automatic altitude-encoding transponder, designated as Mode C (or ModeS, since all Mode S transponders incorporate this feature), provides theair traffic controller with aircraft altitude in 100-foot increments. Thisinformation is displayed on the controller's radar screen with the datablock for each tracked aircraft. The information is transmitted automaticallyin response to radar interrogations of the aircraft's radar transponder,and no communication with the pilot is required. In response to Pub. L. 100-223 and previous FAA regulatory proposals, theagency adopted Amendment 91-203, <T3>Transponder Automatic Altitude Reporting Capability Requirement,</T3>in June 1988 (53 FR 23356, June 21, 1988). The rule requires the use ofa Mode C transponder for all operations within and above a terminal controlarea (TCA) or airport radar service area (ARSA); within 30 miles of a TCAor within 10 miles of certain other airports; and above 10,000 feet abovemean sea level (MSL). A TCAS II or III unit receives information from the Mode C transponderon a target aircraft. The TCAS unit processes the information to providethe pilot of the TCAS airplane with altitude information on potentiallyconflicting aircraft and to provide vertical resolution advisories (RA's)(to climb or descend) to avoid the conflict. Mode C equipment installedon other aircraft is the only source of altitude information for a TCASunit. <ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Comments </ITAG>Seventy commenters responded to Notice No. 87-8. Thirty-three respondentsfavor the proposed rule to require TCAS; however, seventeen from this groupexpressed reservations about the phase-in period and ten stated that thefinal rulemaking should be postponed. A breakout of the respondents showed the following number of commentersby interest category: <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L1,i1,16,r25 </C>  <H1>  </H1><H1>  </H1><ITAG tagnum="1">19<D>Commercial aviation_6 foreign and 13 domestic carriers. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">10<D>Public comment_7 general public, 2 state representatives, and 1 consumergroup. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">10 <D>Government agencies_8 foreign and 2 domestic. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">7 <D>Industry governing bodies. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">9 <D>Industry/technical groups. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">8 <D>Associations. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2 <D>Research organizations. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">4 <D>Airframe manufacturers. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1 <D>Training/educational group. </D><R>s,n</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">70 <D>Total </D></ITAG></ITAG> Phase-In Period Thirty-five commenters expressed concern regarding the phase-in periodfor TCAS. Of these, 12 requested an implementation time of 4 years minimumup to 7 years, with a 5-year period as the most popular timeframe mentioned.Four commenters wanted a uniform time schedule for installation, insteadof the uneven phase-in time proposed in the NPRM. Only one person, a state government representative, mentioned shorteningthe phase-in period. That commenter wants TCAS installed as soon as possible.Three commenters, including two manufacturers, expressed the opinion thatthe proposed deadline could be met. Public Law 100-223 mandated the installation and operation of TCAS II oneach civil aircraft that has a passenger capacity of more than 30 seatsand that is used to provide air transportation of passengers includingintrastate air transportation of passengers. The FAA cannot promulgaterulemaking contrary to the Public Law even in response to public commentsto the proposed rule. Therefore, those comments proposing an extended phase-intime for aircraft with more than 30 passenger seats will not be addressedhere. The FAA agrees that those aircraft with 30 passenger seats or less andoperated under FAR Parts 125 and 135 should not be required to have installeda TCAS II. Part 129 and Part 135 operators of turbine-powered aircraftwith 10 to 30 passenger seats will be required to have a TCAS I systeminstalled and operating. While the technology required to build a TCAS I is fully developed, currently,there is no TCAS I design approved, and no manufacturer has built a TCASI unit. There are three or four manufacturers considering the merits ofdeveloping a TCAS I design. One system is based on a passive design concept,another design is based on active interrogation, and a third concept isa combination of active/passive. These concepts have not been developedto a point where it can be judged whether any of the concepts will functionas required. Considering the time required to develop, test, and obtainapproval of TCAS I design and the time required to develop production facilities,coupled with user installation and training requirements, the need to allowadditional calendar time became apparent. The additional time reflectedin this final rule provides for the fabrication, certification, and operationalevaluation of a TCAS I unit prior to installation on passenger carryingairplanes. In consideration of the absence of an approved TCAS I system at this time,the compliance dates for TCAS I installation and operation have been extendedfrom 5 years to 6 years for those aircraft operating under Parts 129 and135 with 10 to 30 passenger seats. Additionally, the FAA will provide testdata and certain test assistance, and will participate with interestedmanufacturers and users to evaluate and test TCAS I units in accordancewith Technical Standard Order (TSO)-C118, and participate in a field evaluationof TCAS I units with Part 135 carriers. Two manufacturers announced publicly at the Airlines Electronic EngineeringCommittee (AEEC) International Conference on TCAS Implementation, December1 and 2, 1987, that their production of TCAS II systems can be adjustedto accommodate any air carrier installation schedules.Postpone Final RulemakingMost commenters stated that the final rulemaking should be postponed untilthe results of the Limited Installation Program (LIP) system tests couldbe analyzed. The LIP, which continues the operational evaluation of TCASII, requires analysis and periodic reporting to the FAA. The primary objectiveof the LIP is to evaluate the TCAS II preproduction units in air carrierservice using line pilots. United Airlines, the first airline to applyfor supplemental type certificate for installation of a TCAS II systemfor the LIP, completed their 6-month evaluation and currently is in theprocess of completing the data analysis. During the United evaluation atotal of 2,066 flight hours were logged on the two TCAS II equipped airplanes.The system generated a total of 933 traffic advisories (TA's) and 68 RA's.Northwest Airlines is scheduled to begin their LIP evaluation on or aboutSeptember 1, 1988. Northwest will use two MD 80 airplanes for the evaluation.The FAA believes that any fundamental problem existing would have shownup early in the LIP program. None has to date, nor has any major problembeen identified in the Piedmont Phase I or II programs. (The 5-month evaluationof TCAS II on two Piedmont Airlines B-727 airplanes between November 1981and May 1982 is referred to as Piedmont Phase I. The primary objectivesof this evaluation were to assess the operation of TCAS in an air carrieroperational environment and to develop an understanding of the potentialeffect of alerts on air carrier flight operations, flight crews, and ATCcontrollers and on the frequency of alerts and the circumstances underwhich they occur. The operational evaluation of TCAS II on a Piedmont AirlinesB-727 airplane between March 1987 and January 1988 is referred to as PiedmontPhase II. The primary objectives of this operational flight evaluationwere to assess the impacts of TCAS operation on flight crew workload; evaluatethe impacts of TCAS on the ATC system and individual controllers; and obtainflight crew comments on the system's design parameters, displays, and operationalprocedures. The evaluation was also designed to provide additional dataon the frequency of TCAS alerts and the circumstances under which TCASalerts occur, evaluate the effectiveness of the flight crew training program,and identify and resolve equipment certification issues. See NPRM 87-8).Most non-U.S. commenters expressed varying degrees of displeasure at theproposed unilateral action of the United States to mandate the installationand use in U.S. airspace of a collision avoidance system <T3>in the absence of internationally agreed-upon technical specificationsand operational procedures </T3>for such an important system. These internationalstandards, normally developed through the vehicle of the InternationalCivil Aviation Organization (ICAO) for equipment such as this prior tointroduction into the international aviation system, are designed to insureequipment interoperability and avoid equipage redundancy. Hence, most foreignobservers would like to see the U.S. equipage/use requirement delayed and,at the very least, its application to foreign operators under 14 CFR Part129 delayed until such international standards are in place (currentlyexpected to occur in late 1990) and a sufficient period of time is permittedfor system acquisition and installation.With regard to the present status of the effort to standardize the AirborneCollision Avoidance System (ACAS_the international equivalent of the U.S.TCAS), ICAO is relying on the services of technical and operational expertsprovided by 15 countries and 4 international organizations_organized intothe Secondary Surveillance Radar Improvements and Collision Avoidance SystemsPanel (SICASP)_to develop these important technical equipment specificationsand operational procedures, which will result in the safe and efficientuse of this system internationally. United States participation in thiseffort has been very active and has included the FAA, the National Aeronauticsand Space Administration (NASA), U.S. industry groups, and FAA's two majorTCAS contractors, MITRE and Lincoln Labs. At the behest of U.S. and otherparticipants, a concerted effort is being made by this group to completeits work at a spring 1989 meeting, at which time proposed ACAS internationalstandards will be presented to ICAO's Air Navigation Commission and Councilfor final review and approval. Assuming no unexpected difficulties materializeduring this review process, the most critical changes to ICAO documents_thetechnical ACAS equipment specifications in ICAO Annex 10_should becomeapplicable internationally in late 1990.Four commenters mentioned postponing the rule until after the Radio TechnicalCommission for Aeronautics (RTCA) Minimum Operational Performance Standards(MOPS) changes 6 and 7 were complete and Aeronautical Radio Inc. (ARINC)specifications were in final form. The RTCA MOPS, change 6, was not completedin time for publication in TSO C-119, TCAS II; therefore, the TSO referencesFAA Report No. DOT/FAA/SA-88/3, <T3>Required Modifications to the Traffic Alert and Collision AvoidanceSystem (TCAS II) Minimum Operational Performance Standards (MOPS). </T3>Whenchange 6 is approved by the RTCA Council, the TSO will be revised to referenceRTCA DO-185 changes 1 through 6. Change 7 is not required for FAA approval.One manufacturer recommended delaying the rule and holding the docket openuntil the LIP is finished and all reports are made available and the MITREreport 87W000157 is released and reviewed. The United Airlines LIP reporthas been completed and made available in the docket. The Mitre report 87W000157was revised and adopted in the TSO.Public law 100-223, section 203, does not permit compliance dates for TCASII later than those adopted in this rule, and the FAA could not considercomments requesting later dates.Technical DiscussionThirty-three commenters included a discussion of TCAS, ACAS, Mode S, ModeC, or ATC technologies in their comments. Many in this group expressedthe opinion that the technology still needed to be ``fine tuned'' beforeimplementation. The FAA has provided for fine tuning of TCAS through theRTCA SC-147 committee working groups. The RTCA MOPS change 6 will containadditional fine tuning features, including simplification of the TCAS-to-TCAScoordination process, elimination of the advisory invalid indication, andmany other recommendations.One commenter postulated that the requirements for all aircraft to have``active TCAS systems would overload and violate the FAA's own requirementof limiting radio use for TCAS purposes to 1 percent of the total usageof the frequency that TCAS would operate on.'' This issue is not new. Itwas identified as one of the main development questions when, in 1982-84,the Beacon Collision Avoidance System (BCAS) design was extended to TCASby increasing the ability to operate effectively under high density conditions.In the Lincoln Laboratory report that documents this development effort,``TCAS II: Design and Validation of the High-Traffic-Density SurveillanceSubsystem,'' this issue is clearly identified (ATC-126, Feb-85, pages 2-6to 2-9). The TCAS II includes a provision called ``Interference Limiting,'' thepurpose of which is to insure that TCAS transmissions will not cause anydegradation of any other systems operating in the 1030/1090 MHz frequencybands. During the TCAS development, it was recognized that a number ofpossible interference mechanisms needed to be considered: (1) Receptionof TCAS interrogations by transponders, (2) reception of TCAS replies byground-based ATCRBS equipment, and (3) self-suppression of the transponderson the TCAS aircraft. It was decided to place limits on TCAS transmissionsin such a way as to give TCAS a low priority in these frequency bands.In doing this, a rather severe limit of 2 percent was adopted as the maximuminterference that can be contributed by all of the TCAS transmissions ina given area. The Interference Limiting standards were initially determinedanalytically from basic principles of physics. It was found that a relativelysimple model could be implemented to provide the ability to adapt to anygiven density of aircraft and any percentage that are TCAS equipped. Subsequently,the interference limiting design was assessed by a large interference simulationof the 1030/1090 MHz bands. This simulation study was conducted by theElectromagnetic Compatibility Analysis Center (ECAC), making use of theirexperience in assessing many other similar interference issues. The simulationincluded a large number of aircraft, each with a given flight path, actingtogether with a large number of ground-based interrogators, with powerlevels, beamwidths, and other characteristics relating to operating conditionspredicted for the 1995 timeframe. Two main conclusions resulted from thisstudy. One was that the 2 percent interference allocation for TCAS wasnot exceeded. The other was that radio transmissions attributable to TCASwere completely insignificant in their effects on the performance of theground-based ATCRBS equipment. As a result of this analysis and testing,the FAA concluded that there will not be a frequency interference problem.One manufacturer submitted the following comments not previously addressed.<T3>Comment: </T3>Equipment designs tested to date have not representedproduction TCAS II equipment. Representative equipment must be tested sothat its acceptability in service can be assessed. Logic included in equipmenttested, or to be tested (LIP), does not include corrective logic for ``AltitudeCrossover'' or ``TCAS-Invalid'' deficiencies. <T3>FAA response: </T3>The FAA will conduct flight tests of productionunits to validate the corrective logic. <T3>Comment: </T3>Display requirements for ``Glass Cockpits'' will notbe defined before mid-1988. <T3>FAA response: </T3>The FAA defined and issued display requirementsfor ``Glass Cockpits'' in an advisory circular (AC) entitled <T3>Airworthiness and Operational Approval of Traffic Alert and CollisionAvoidance Systems (TCAS II) and Mode S Transponders, </T3>AC No. 20-131,October 3, 1988. <T3>Comment: </T3>Certification requirements, analysis, simulation, andflight test are not adequately defined, nor is a flight criticality levelfor TCAS II certification specified. <T3>FAA response: </T3>As previously mentioned, AC No. 20-131 was publishedon October 3, 1988. It proposes acceptable certification criteria. TheTCAS II system must be certified to the essential level, and the softwareprograms to level 2 of RTCA DO-178A. <T3>Comment: </T3>Certification requirements for compliance with foreignregulatory agency requirements for TCAS deactivation are unknown. <T3>FAA response: </T3>There is a possibility that a foreign governmentmay request a U.S. TCAS-equipped airplane to deactivate the TCAS system,which is provided for in the TCAS equipment standards. Section 91.1 ofthe FAR's provides for compliance with the foreign government regulatoryrequirements. <T3>Comment: </T3>Certification requirements for U.S. carriers with airplanesdedicated to service abroad, such as Pan Am, are unknown. <T3>FAA response: </T3>Public Law 100-223 requires installation ``on eachcivil aircraft which has a maximum passenger capacity of more than 30 seatsand which is used to provide air transportation of passengers. . . .''An air carrier operator who experiences hardship due to this regulationmay petition for an exemption under section 601 of the FA Act of 1958.<T3>Comment: </T3>The means of providing integrated TA's and RA's on olderairplanes without color weather radar displays has not been economicallyaddressed. <T3>FAA response: </T3>The FAA minimum requirements specified in the TSOwill require only a minimum of a three-target display. Any display beyondthis minimum will be evaluated at the time of certification. <T3>Comment:</T3> Required crew response to TA's and RA's should be specified.For TCAS to be effective, a standard mandatory response is necessary. <T3>FAA response: </T3>The FAA does not believe that a mandatory responseto TA's or RA's is necessary or appropriate. The AC for TCAS II certificationand operation [AC No. 20-131; October 3, 1988] addresses crew trainingobjectives. Mode CFive commenters addressed the issue of using Mode C. Generally, the respondentsexpressed the opinion that Part 125 aircraft should be allowed to use ModeC as an alternative to the TCAS II system, as the TCAS equipment costswould be prohibitive for such a class of operator. As previously mentioned,if the Part 125 operator's aircraft is configured for 30 passenger seatsor less, then that aircraft is exempt from the TCAS requirement. ICAO/PART 129 Foreign CarriersThe majority of comments mentioning ICAO (15) suggest that the FAA shouldcoordinate TCAS implementation with Standards and Recommended Practices(SARPS) for international standardization. A standard for an ACAS generatedby ICAO is especially important to foreign carriers. The FAA is activelyparticipating with various ICAO technical groups through SICASP in an effortto generate this standard. The SICASP group will have been provided allFAA data concerning TCAS. Of the comments addressing only the issue of TCAS implementation in Part129 aircraft, two are against, two are for, and three request additionaltime to comply. Public law 100-223 did not exempt foreign air carrier operations,within U.S. airspace, from TCAS II requirements. The Congressional findingstates that public health and safety requirements necessitate the timelycompletion and installation of a collision avoidance system for use bycommercial aircraft flying in the United States. However, the FAA is extendingthe compliance time from 5 to 6 years for airplanes with 10 to 30 seats.These operators may elect to install TCAS I, II, or III. If they installa TCAS II or III unit, it must be compatible with TSO C-119. Foreign air carrier aircraft with more than 30 passenger seats will berequired to have installed and operating a TCAS II system, compatible withTSO C-119, when operating in the United States after December 30, 1991.Upgrade TCAS II to TCAS IIIIn responding to the issue of upgrading TCAS II to TCAS III, most commentsaddressed the need for clarification. The respondents stated that the impliedrequirement for upgrading was questionable and should be more definitive.The upgrading has the support of one manufacturer, and another is supportiveof the idea to require that TCAS III include the same operational criteriathat will be used for TCAS II. One manufacturer stated that the ``incentiveto provide TCAS III growth is too vague to justify economic commitments.''Although the FAA has not required or proposed a compliance date for TCASIII, it will continue to develop, test, and evaluate TCAS III and providedata and technical support to RTCA for development of a TCAS III MOPS.Although the FAA may support a particular design for testing, it is moreimportant that it fosters the development of the MOPS. The FAA continuesto support a LIP for TCAS III. Other than the air-to-air coordination logic, the manufacturer has freedomof design of the TCAS systems. The FAA agrees with the commenter who expressedconcerns regarding the interoperability of TCAS II and III. The TCAS IIdesign shall not preclude the upgradeability to, nor the interoperabilityof, TCAS II and III. This rule does not mandate a TCAS III system. Newrulemaking would have to be initiated for the requirement of TCAS III.TrainingEight commenters were evenly divided concerning the need for standardizedtraining prior to TCAS II implementation. Those who favor training requirementswant training to focus on end-level performance, and do not believe thata specific technique is important. Training should focus also on difficultiesinvolving the upgrade from TCAS II to TCAS III. The FAA intended the trainingrequirements proposed in the NPRM to be training objectives, and the trainingprogram may not necessarily be limited to the proposed items. The trainingitems, as proposed, appear in AC No. 20-131 dated October 3, 1988. TheAC prescribes a means, but not the only means, of complying with the regulatoryrequirements. Advisory CircularFive commenters addressed the need to publish AC's regarding the TCAS system.Domestic industries that responded to this issue requested that such acircular be published 24 months in advance of the rule adoption. The FAApublished AC No. 20-131 on October 3, 1988, to provide guidance for theinstallation and operational approval of TCAS III.Product LiabilitySeveral commenters, some foreign, addressed the issue of product liability.The commenters suggested that, as a result of the FAA's requirement toinstall a system designed and developed by the FAA, the Government willbe subject to product liability claims for use of TCAS equipment. Somecommenters further requested that the FAA voluntarily indemnify the regulatedoperators from such liability.The FAA considers the TCAS requirement similar to other operating requirementsinvolving the use of certain equipment, and the agency does not considerit necessary or beneficial to make any special provision for liabilityclaims against the Government or regulated operators.ApplicabilityThirty-six commenters addressed this issue. Four of the comments were sentby private individuals, nine were sent by foreign agencies, and the remainderwere submitted by domestic (U.S.) industries. The primary concern expressedwas that TCAS I should be required for Part 135 operators, but not TCASII. Many commenters expressed the opinion that there is no justificationfor the use of the TCAS system over other collision avoidance systems.As previously stated, the FAA relaxed the TCAS requirement and compliancetimes proposed in the NPRM for Part 135 operators. Additionally, the FAAwill evaluate passive/active TCAS I systems.Foreign operators stated that it was necessary to continue to allow ATCRBSto be used, due to the cost of installing and operating Mode S, and thatthe installation of the TCAS system should be limited to new U.S.-registeredaircraft. Many comments addressed the need for uniform installation ofthe TCAS system, and a few respondents expressed the opinion that ModeC should be mandatory in all aircraft.The FAA addressed the Mode C requirement in another rulemaking action,``Transponders With Automatic Altitude Reporting Capability Requirement,''Amendment No. 91-203 (53 FR 23356; June 21, 1988). Mode S is a necessarycomponent of TCAS II. The Mode S air-to-air data link provides TCAS IIwith the coordination procedures necessary for the proper RA in a TCASto TCAS conflict. The TCAS I does not require a Mode S transponder to beinstalled.The introduction of TCAS I and II is expected to reduce substantially thethreat of midair collision. To equip only new U.S.-registered aircraftwould be inconsistent with the requirements of Pub. L. 100-223 and woulddelay the benefits of a TCAS program. A high degree of protection can berealized for those operators with the expanded requirement for Mode C ingeneral aviation aircraft and TCAS II in air carrier aircraft. Concernswere raised about the size, weight, and interfacing of the new equipment,and some comments cited the need to test representative equipment to assessits service acceptability. Some commenters stated that the display of aircraftwas an essential component in the Minimum Equipment List (MEL). The FAApromulgates minimum standards and evaluates manufacturers' designs to thosestandards. Size, weight, and interface are market place decisions. Serviceacceptability will be assessed in that the system is compatible with otherTCAS designs with respect to coordination logic and human factor considerations.The FAA evaluates the display systems for minimum requirements and functionalcompatibility during the certification evaluation in the aircraft.Nine commenters expressed concerns relative to Part 125 aircraft. Fourof these respondents stated that Part 125 aircraft should be exempt fromthe rule or be allowed to maintain the existing ATCRBS system requirements.The Congressional mandate covers all commercial aircraft with passengerseating configuration of more than 30 seats. With respect to aircraft with30 seats or less, the FAA agrees with the comments. Under the rule adopted,those aircraft operating under the provisions of Part 125 in nonrevenuepassenger service, with passenger seat configuration of 30 seats or less,will not be required to have a TCAS system installed.Include All AviationFifteen commenters stated that the only way to ensure maximum effectivenessof the proposed TCAS system is to extend the requirement to include Part125, Part 129, Part 135, and military aviation aircraft. The final ruledoes include aircraft operating under these parts to varying degrees, butit does not apply to military aircraft. However, the U.S. Navy is studyingthe feasibility of using TCAS I on military trainers, and the FAA is cooperatingwith the Navy to pursue certification of a passive/active system for theNavy T-34C trainer aircraft.One commenter questioned whether the rule is to apply to air cargo carriers.The Part 121 rule specifically addresses aircraft with passenger configurationof more than 30 seats. However, if there is a split cargo/passenger aircraftwith more than 30 seats, the airplane must have a TCAS II installed; 10to 30 seats, the airplane must have at least a TCAS I installed. However,the FAA will not require installation of a TCAS on a large combinationcargo/passenger airplane simply because of the capability for increasingpassenger capacity, if the aircraft is not operated with 10 or more passengerseats.One commenter suggested issuing a supplemental NPRM that airworthinessregulations be amended to require TCAS and to adjust the requirement ofSection 25.1309 to recognize the value of TCAS in reducing overall risk.The FAA does not believe this is necessary in that all Part 25 aircraftare not required to have TCAS II installed according to the operating rules.FAA ResponsibilitySeveral comments received expressed a desire that configuration of theCollision Avoidance System (CAS) software be the responsibility of theFAA. The FAA does control the configuration of the CAS logic software byrequirements in the TSO and subsequent installation approval. To changethe software of the CAS logic would require the TSO holder to apply tothe FAA for approval of a major change to the original approved designdata. Deviations (major changes) to TSO's are only approved by the AircraftEngineering Division of the Office of Airworthiness in Washington, DC.Pilot Immunity for TCASThere are several commenters who desire the FAA to grant blanket immunityto pilots for following or failing to follow an RA from the TCAS. The FAAcannot support this proposal from the industry for the following reasons:(a) The pilot will always be ultimately responsible for his/her actionsand must be held accountable for them. In the case of TCAS, there is nodoubt that there may be instances where the pilot will be ``off-altitude''in response to a TCAS-generated RA, and may indeed be involved in a nearmidair collision or an actual collision. During the review process of theincident, as in all incidents, all factors will be considered, includingthe factors that are TCAS related, and a determination made. This is theonly position that the FAA can take on this matter and it must be madeclear to all operators of TCAS.(b) The FAA has never granted blanket immunity to flightcrews for any operationregardless of the criticality of that operation. There is no legal precedentfor granting such broad relief from responsibility. Section 91.3 of theFAR states, ``The pilot in command of an aircraft is directly responsiblefor, and is the final authority as to, the operation of that aircraft.''Introducing TCAS into the National Airspace System does nothing to changethis regulation.Every consideration will be given to the flightcrew in the review processfor TCAS-related incidents. All factors will be thoroughly reviewed anddetermination made as to responsibility.Aviation Trust FundOne commenter expressed the opinion that the FAA would be well advisedto use the Aviation Trust Fund to upgrade and improve the existing ATCsystem. This comment is outside the scope of this NPRM.Economic ConsiderationsOf the 32 comments received mentioning economic considerations, only tworespondents, both elected government representatives, were of the opinionthat the cost involved is minimal. Most commented that the economic impactis not adequately addressed. Specific concerns voiced include those fromsmall operators who believe they will be forced out of business, and largeairlines who believe that the upgrade from TCAS II to TCAS III will becostly. As previously mentioned, the FAA relaxed the time for compliancefor airplanes having a seating capacity of 10 to 30 passenger seats. Thischange will definitely reduce the economic impact on small operators. Fourcommenters proposed less costly alternate systems to TCAS.In the NPRM the FAA agreed to consider passive versus active TCAS I systemsas long as the applicant can demonstrate that the passive system providesthe equivalent level of safety as active TCAS I. To date, the FAA has receivedno valid data to show that a passive TCAS I can meet the safety intentof the rule, so this final action assumes an active TCAS I. If passiveTCAS I can be demonstrated to meet the rule, than the FAA would be amenableto follow-on regulatory action to allow its use.The FAA does not expect to mandate TCAS III at this time. The economicconsiderations for TCAS II are discussed in the regulatory impact analysissummary.Other Comments Not Previously AddressedOne manufacturer suggested new standards for automatic altitude reportingbe required similar to an ATA petition dated March 25, 1986. Although theFAA would have to agree that reduced altitude error does increase the accuracyof the projected flight path of the intruder aircraft during TCAS tracking,the safety analysis done on the current altitude encoder errors would concludesafe TCAS operation.One commenter was concerned that there was no data on the performance characteristicsof TCAS II in high wing with engines mounted on the wing. The FAA doesnot have any information or data that indicates there will be any adverseeffect of TCAS operation on these aircraft. However, the FAA will conductin-service evaluations in such aircraft to obtain system performance andaircraft performance information.One commenter, James Pope, was critical of the FAA's TCAS program and supportedan ACAS unit not dependent on radar transponders. Pope alleged that 770lives have been lost in ACAS-preventable midair collisions during the developmentof TCAS. This commenter asserts that NPRM 87-8 must be promptly withdrawnand immediate action taken by FAA to certify the proven and ready-to-goACAS.This commenter has previously made these same allegations to the FAA whichwere subsequently investigated on two occasions by the General AccountingOffice and found to be without basis. The FAA believes that it has previouslyprovided detailed answers to the commenter's allegations, and does notbelieve it is necessary to give an indepth analysis here. Anyone wishinga copy of the investigative reports can contact the person identified underthe section, <T2>``For Further Information Contact</T2>.''Discussion of RuleThe FAA currently operates a complex network of facilities and subsystemsdesigned to ensure the safe and efficient operation of the National AirspaceSystem (NAS). Operations within the NAS and its many components are governedby an array of Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) and procedures. Consequently,a wide variety of facilities and services are available. Nevertheless,the primary function of separating aircraft is predicated on the fundamentalconcepts of ground-based control and the see-and-avoid responsibility ofthe flightcrew.Under the see-and-avoid concept, the level of safety is related to theability of pilots, individually and collectively, to detect and avoid encounterswith other aircraft. Although common sense and the FAR require continuousadherence to the principles of see-and-avoid, the concept does have limitations.The pilot's ability to acquire aircraft visually on collision courses isreduced under heavy workload conditions, in areas of high traffic densities,and when the aircraft is in conditions of poor visibility.The second fundamental concept upon which the separation of aircraft ispredicated is ground-based control. Through the issuance of instructions,clearances, and advisories, air traffic controllers ensure that prescribedseparation standards are applied between aircraft. Since these instructionsare based on known and projected flight information, this system does notrely totally on the pilot's ability to acquire traffic visually to achieveacceptable levels of safety. In some segments of the NAS, such as terminalcontrol areas, positive control is exercised, and operations in such airspaceare conducted under ATC instructions. A terminal radar service area isan example of upgrading of the see-and-avoid concept and represents a complexcontrol environment, since both controlled and uncontrolled aircraft areoperating in the area. The overall collision avoidance system design mustaddress the unique problems of such a mixed traffic environment.The FAA's approach to TCAS is to encourage the development of a familyof onboard collision avoidance systems, to demonstrate the operationaland technical feasibility of the concept, and to support the developmentof national/international standards for the equipment. A principal objectiveof the TCAS approach is to provide a range of collision avoidance equipmentalternatives for the full spectrum of airspace users ranging from smallairplanes to large transport category airplane. The TCAS Program consistsof the following three program elements: TCAS I, which provides only TA's;TCAS II, which provides TA's and RA's in the vertical plane only; and TCASIII, which provides TA's and RA's in both the vertical and the horizontalplanes.On December 30, 1987, the President of the United States signed Pub. L.100-223 which among other provisions, amended the FA Act of 1958, Section601, by adding a new paragraph (f) entitled ``Collision Avoidance Systems.''This new section requires TCAS II on ``each civil aircraft which has amaximum passenger capacity of more than 30 seats and which is used to provideair transportation of passengers, including intrastate air transportationof passengers.'' The amendment does not provide for the exception of anyclass of civil operation or operator, U.S. or foreign, from the basic rule.The rule adopted provides for the installation of appropriate TCAS unitson airplanes used in commercial air carrier, selected air taxi/commuteroperations, and on airplanes used by foreign carriers flying in the U.S.airspace. The categories of commercial aircraft for which TCAS I or IIwill be required are based on the provisions of Pub. L 100-223 and on therelative speed of the aircraft, the size of the aircraft, and the numberof passengers per aircraft who would benefit from TCAS installation.Aircraft operating exclusively under Part 91, General Operating and FlightRules, are not required to have installed any TCAS equipment. However,if an operator or owner elects to install a TCAS unit, the system mustbe FAA approved and operated according to FAA prescribed procedures. TheTCAS system installed must be shown to operate in the ATC system and incoordination with other FAA approved active TCAS systems.Part 135 commuter and air taxi operators of turbine powered airplanes with10 to 30 passenger seats will be required to install a TCAS I system toprovide TA's from other transponder-equipped aircraft. These advisoriesshould give bearing and distance from the TCAS-equipped airplane in thecase where the other aircraft have only a Mode A transponder (no altitudereporting). If the intruder aircraft is Mode C- or Mode S-equipped, theTCAS I unit should also display altitude, which provides the pilot a sectorboth in the vertical as well as the horizontal plane to look for the threataircraft. TCAS I, although not providing an RA, does provide sufficientalerting time for the pilot to visually acquire the threat aircraft andtake evasive action if necessary. Although the RTCA MOPS has been approvedfor TCAS I, no system has been built to date. The FAA believes that developmentof collision avoidance equipment that can meet the TCAS I MOPS is wellwithin the state of the art for equipment manufacturers and that adequatequantities to supply the commuter/air taxi fleet can be manufactured andinstalled during the time period prescribed.Part 135 operators of 10 to 30 passenger seat turbine powered airplanesare required to have installed a TCAS I within 6 years after the effectivedate of the rule. Installation of TCAS I does not require the installationof a Mode S transponder.Part 121 and 125 operators of large airplanes of more than 30 seats arerequired to have TCAS II and Mode S installed and operating by December30, 1991. These operators may wish to upgrade to TCAS III units when theybecome available. Much research is necessary to develop TCAS III to thepoint that it can be type certificated. The ability to produce operationalTCAS III units is many years away.Part 129 foreign air carrier operators of turbine powered airplanes withpassenger seating configurations of 10 to 30 are required to have installedand operating a TCAS I when operating in U.S. airspace 6 years after theeffective date of this rule. Foreign air carrier operators of airplaneswith more than 30 passenger seats are required to have installed and operatinga TCAS II and Mode S transponder when operating in U.S. airspace afterDecember 30, 1991. The FAA believes that this final rule will encourageaffected foreign airplane operators, and their airworthiness authorities,to become familiar with the associated TSO's and RTCA documents that formthe basis of approval and manufacture of a TCAS approved by the FAA. TheTCAS systems approved by foreign airworthiness authorities must be compatiblewith and perform with the FAA-approved TCAS, transponders, and ATC systemwhen operating in United States airspace.Where the rules require a TCAS I or II unit, the intended minimum TCASunits are those complying with the requirements of TSO C-118 and TSO C-119as appropriate, with the exception of Part 129 foreign air carrier operators.Where the rule specifies an approved TCAS, the installer may elect TCASI, II, or III. Where the rule requires a TCAS II, the installer may electTCAS II or III. There is no requirement, at this time, for the installationof a TCAS III system. The TCAS III system is being developed to enhancethe basic TCAS II system by providing a more accurate surveillance capabilityand alternative escape maneuver selection in the horizontal plane. TheFAA can envision that some operators may want to update their TCAS II unitsto TCAS III when available. The required TCAS III system design as willbe defined in the applicable TSO and MOPS will permit the upgrading ofa TCAS II unit to a TCAS III. In the applicable standards for TCAS II,whenever a choice exists between TCAS II and TCAS III elements (i.e., antenna,etc.), the TCAS III element will be specified in the TSO and MOPS. TheFAA is committed to support the development of TCAS III. Any rulemakingconcerning mandatory use of TCAS III will be handled separately from thisrulemaking.Flight Manual Requirements and Operational Approval Where the rule requires TCAS to be used in air carrier service, operationalapproval must be obtained from the FAA at the time that certification (TCor STC) application is made. The applicant must submit for approval flightcrew qualification, training program, and TCAS inoperative items to beincluded in the appropriate Master Minimum Equipment List. Technical Standard Order The RTCA Special Committee SC-147 has developed RTCA Document DO-197, MinimumOperational Performance Standards (MOPS) for An Active Traffic Alert andCollision Avoidance System I (Active TCAS I). This document forms the basisof a TSO that will permit the active TCAS I to be manufactured under theTSO approval system. The RTCA Document DO-185, Volume I and II, Changes 1 thru 5, <T3>Minimum Operational Performance Standards for Traffic Alert and CollisionAvoidance System (TCAS) Airborne Equipment</T3> and FAA Report No. DOT/FAA/SA-88/3,<T3>Required Modifications to the Traffic Alert and Collision AvoidanceSystem (TCAS II) Minimum Operational Performance Standards (MOPS)</T3>set forth standards for TCAS II equipment. These documents will also formthe basis of a TSO to permit manufacturing under the TSO approval system.The TCAS III MOPS will be a new RTCA document separate from DO-185 butwill identify a system functionally compatible and interchangeable withTCAS II. The three TCAS systems I, II, and III will be identified underthe TSO system by different TSO numbers. Concurrent with the publicationof this rule, the FAA is publishing TCAS I and TCAS II TSO's defining theminimum standards for such units. While FAA research, to date, has focused on an active TCAS I, it has beensuggested by some people that a passive (listen only) device may be ableto meet the same objective intended by the active TCAS I units. While thisregulatory action on a TCAS I TSO presupposes an active TCAS I, the FAAwishes to go on record as not being opposed to a passive TCAS I, as longas it meets the same safety objectives of DO-197. TCAS Training Requirements The introduction of TCAS into revenue service need have little impact onthe existing regulations regarding required crew training, and thereforeshould not require a change to the existing training requirements. As specifiedin andSection;121.401, a Part 121 certificate holder is required to establish,obtain the appropriate initial and final approval of, and provide a trainingprogram that meets the requirements of Part 121, Subpart N, and insurethat each crewmember is adequately trained to perform his/her assignedduties. Section 121.401 will have the effect of requiring training on TCAS.Section 121.415(g) requires that each crewmember qualify in any new equipment,including modifications to airplanes. Section 121.407(a)(3) requires thateach airplane simulator and other training device be modified to conformwith any modification to the airplane being simulated. The pilot training program for TCAS should provide the flightcrew the necessaryknowledge, skills, and abilities to safely conduct TCAS operations. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Impact Analysis Summary </ITAG>Introduction This section summarizes the cost impact and benefit assessment of the finalrule to amend Parts 1, 91, 121, 125, 129, and 135 of the Federal AviationRegulations (FAR) to require the installation and use of a Traffic Alertand Collision Avoidance Systems (TCAS) in large transport airplanes andcertain turbine-powered smaller airplanes. TCAS II, which utilizes a signalfrom existing transponders equipped with altitude encoding capability,provides collision avoidance guidance in the airplane independent of theground Air Traffic Control (ATC) system. These amendments also requirethat all operators of TCAS-equipped airplanes have an FAA-approved trainingprogram for flight crewmembers. Finally, this rule requires that certainsmall aircraft be equipped with TCAS I, a simpler system providing collisionalert warning but no flight guidance. The amendments are in response tolegislation that mandates the FAA to require the installation and operationof TCAS in certain commercial airplanes flying in the United States. These amendments stem from a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on August 26, 1987. Comments on the proposalwere submitted by individuals, foreign and domestic air carriers, air carrierand airplane pilot associations, foreign and domestic Government agencies,research and consultant organizations, avionics manufacturers, and theNational Transportation Safety Board. Approximately half of the 70 respondentsexpressed support of the proposed rule to require TCAS. The remaining respondents,however, opposed certain proposed requirements and disagreed with the economicimpact estimates presented in the preliminary regulatory analysis. TheFAA has evaluated the public comments and made a final determination regardingtheir impact. The comments have caused the FAA to revise its estimatesof economc impacts and increase compliance costs. The final rule amendmentsto Parts 121, 125, and 129 require that after December 30, 1991, no personmay operate a large airplane that has a passenger seating configuration,excluding any pilot seat, of more than 30 seats unless it is equipped withan approved TCAS II and the appropriate class of Mode S transponder. A substantial change in the final rule is the elimination of the requirementcontained in the notice that airplanes operated under 14 CFR Parts 125,129, and 135 having a passenger seating configuration of 20 to 30 seatsbe equipped with TCAS II. The final rule, therefore, requires that turbine-poweredairplanes operated under Parts 129 and 135 having a passenger seating configurationof 10 to 30 seats, excluding pilot seats, be equipped with TCAS I undera longer than normal compliance period. Cost-Benefit Analysis Executive Order 12291 of February 17, 1981, requires that to the extentpermitted by law, regulatory action not be taken unless the potential benefitsto society for the regulation outweigh potential societal costs. This determinationis normally made on the basis of a regulatory evaluation. In this case,however, the Congress may be said to have already determined that thisfinal rule is in the public interest; that is, its collective public benefitsoutweigh its costs to the public, because Congress has required the rulebe promulgated (The Airport and Airway Safety and Capacity Expansion Actof 1987: Pub. L. 100-223). Nevertheless, the FAA has prepared this conventionalregulatory evaluation of the rule. The purpose of this evaluation is notto justify taking this rulemaking action (which has already been done throughcongressional action), but to estimate dollar costs and benefits to promoteunderstanding of the impact of the rule. Costs The FAA finds that the revisions to Parts 1 and 91 will have no cost impact.The amendments, however, to Parts 121, 125, 129, and 135 will cause affectedcertificate holders to incur costs. The FAA recognizes that there will be costs associated with the amendmentsto Part 129. These costs are likely to be similar to those incurred byaffected Parts 121 and 135 certificate holders, but have not been quantifiedbecause the burden of compliance will not be directly borne by any sectorof U.S. society. The methods and assumptions used in this analysis to prepare the finalcost and benefit estimates for the revisions to Parts 121, 125, and 135have been developed by the FAA. Data used to develop cost estimates atthe NPRM stage of rulemaking were obtained from manufacturers, air carriers,avionics repair facilities, and industry trade associations. The FAA hasupdated this information and conducted additional research to respond tothe comments concerning the economic impact estimates of various proposals.The information obtained has been used to formulate the final cost estimatesof the rule. The cost and benefits calculated for the final rule are projectedover the estimated 15-year life cycle of TCAS equipment. Therefore, thisanalysis compares the costs and benefits of TCAS II equipment for Parts121 and 125 over a 15-year period of 1989 to 2003. To allow sufficienttime for the development and certification, this rule does not requirethe use of TCAS I until 1996. Accordingly, to reflect the longer than normalcompliance period, the analysis for Part 135 has been extended over the15-year period of 1993 to 2007. New andSection;121.356 will have an economic impact on the 3,365 existingairplanes expected to be in service in 1989 and 3,100 airplanes expectedto be manufactured between 1989 and 2003 because these airplanes will berequired to be equipped with a TCAS II system. The estimated cost of thisrequirement is $806.3 million in 1987 dollars and $543.0 million at a presentworth discount rate of 10 percent over the 15-year period of 1989 to 2003.The amendments to Part 121 will also require that air carriers developand implement an FAA-approved TCAS II training program for their captainsand first officers. The training program will require that air carriersinstall approved TCAS II aerodynamic data programs in their flight simulatorsand provide an additional one and a half hours of classroom instructionduring initial training for their existing and newly-hired flightcrews.As part of the classroom instruction, certificate holders will be requiredto use a real time interactive device to complete transfer of system knowledgefrom the classroom to the cockpit. The estimated cost of modifying the150 flight simulators currently in use by Part 121 certificate holdersis $2.2 million in 1987 dollars and $2.0 million discounted at a presentworth rate of 10 percent in the first year the rule is in effect. The costof acquiring the small computers to be used as interactive training devicesto transfer and reinforce classroom instruction is estimated to be $462thousand in 1987 and $420 thousand discounted the first year the rule isin effect. The estimated cost of requiring captains and first officers of the 149affected Part 121 certificate holders to undergo additional classroom trainingis $24.5 million and $13.7 million discounted over the projected time period.Finally, the onetime cost of developing an FAA-approved TCAS II trainingprogram is estimated to be $3.7 million in 1987 dollars and $3.4 milliondiscounted at a rate of 10 percent in the first year the rule is in effect.This analysis indicates that the total cost of compliance to Part 121 certificateholders with the equipment acquisition, installation, maintenance, andflight crewmember training requirements contained in this rule is estimatedto have a present value of $562.5 million over the 15-year period of 1989to 2003. The addition of andSection;125.224 will require that airplanes with a passengerseating configuration, excluding any pilot seats, of more than 30 seatsbe equipped with TCAS II. The estimated cost of equipping the 22 airplanesnow operating under the rule of Part 125 is $2.5 million in 1987 dollarsand $2.3 over the 15-year period of 1989 to 2003.The amendments to Part 135 will require that all turbine powered airplaneswith 10 to 30 passenger seats be equipped with TCAS I. In addition, therule will require that all operators of TCAS I equipped airplanes havean FAA-approved TCAS I training program for flight crewmembers.The estimated cost of equipping 2,772 airplanes with TCAS I units is $34.1million in 1987 dollars and $14.7 million discounted over the 15-year projectedservice life of the equipment of 1994 to 2008. The estimated cost of requiringthe flightcrews of affected air taxi and commuter operators to undergoadditional classroom training during the initial phase of flight trainingis $1.3 million in 1987 dollars and $0.7 million at a 10 percent presentworth rate. Finally, affected Part 135 operators required to have an FAA-approvedtraining program will incur a one-time cost estimated to be $1.0 millionin 1987 dollars and $.9 million discounted at 10 percent the first yearthe rule is in effect. On the basis of the above, the aggregate impactof these amendments on affected air taxi and commuters is $36.5 millionin 1987 dollars and $16 million when discounted at 10 percent over the15-year period of 1993 to 2007.BenefitsThe TCAS rule is expected to provide potential benefits primarily in theform of improved safety to the aviation community and flying public. Suchsafety, for example, will take the form of reduced casualty losses (namely,fatalities and property damages) as the result of a lowered likelihoodof midair collisions.In general terms, the benefits of an effective airborne traffic alert andcollision avoidance system in reducing the risk of midair collisions systemin reducing the risk of midair collisions have been obvious for many years.As air traffic continues to increase and concentrate at terminal areas,the growing consensus of both the general public and most aviation professionalsis that such a system would be a valuable safety addition. In 1987, Congressdetermined that requiring TCAS II in most large aircraft is in the publicinterest. Although experienced airspace system operators also agree thatthe system would be beneficial, accurately quantifying benefits is difficultbecause (fortunately) there have been few actual Part 121 midair collisionsin recent years. At the time of the notice, the FAA developed a mathematicalmodel to assess the increase in collision risk that would result from theprojected growth in aviation traffic activity. The FAA used a ``squarelaw model'' to forecast that four midair collisions involving a large airplaneand 24 midair collisions of taxi and commuter airplanes would occur ifno additional safety measures were taken to offset the affects of trafficgrowth. Since that time, the FAA has analyzed the issue further, and hasconcluded that although the ``square law model'' is simple to apply andyields specific results, the air traffic control system is too complexfor the model to be expected to provide reasonably accurate results. Forthis reason, the FAA has changed the basis of its benefits analysis forthe final rule. The fact is, that given the very few midair collisionsinvolving large aircraft that have occurred in recent years, and giventhe air traffic control improvements that have occurred and will occurshortly (such as new Mode C requirements), it is not possible to reasonablyforecast specific numbers of future midair collisions. Also, the FAA isunable to allocate specific numbers of future midair collisions that willbe avoided in the future between the new Mode C requirements and this TCASrule. Instead of attempting to do this, the FAA has chosen to estimatea range of midair collisions that may occur. Currently, the stage is setfor a midair collision only when one or both pilots of two aircraft makea mistake <T3>and</T3> the ATC system fails <T3>and</T3> TCAS fails. In the enroute system, TCAS plays a somewhat strongerrole where ATC radar coverage does not exist.The above factors tend to reduce the number of future midair collisions.On the other hand, steadily increasing traffic levels tend to increasethe risk. In an attempt to estimate the range of midair collisions withinwhich the actual number of future midair collisions of large aircraft willfall, the FAA employed a Poisson distribution. Based on a history of twocollisions in the recent past, the Poisson distribution indicates thatthere is a 60 percent probability two or more collisions in the futureforecast period, and a 95 percent probability that the number will notexceed seven. The FAA believes that the range of two to seven is a reasonableexpectation of the number of midair collisions involving a large aircraftduring the next 15 years. In monetary terms, over the subject time period,this rule is expected to accrue potential benefits ranging between $207million and $724 million (discounted, in 1987 dollars).A similar analysis of the number of Part 135 midair collisions that maybe avoided through TCAS I yields a range of 4 to 14 during the 15-yearanalysis period. Based on the moderate cost of TCAS I, this part of therule is cost-beneficial throughout the range of potential midair collisionsavoided. For example, in monetary terms, over the subject time period,this rule is expected to accrue potential benefits ranging between $27million and $97 million (discounted, in 1987 dollars), compared to costsof $18 million (which included $2 million for the Mode C rule).In view of the aforementioned discussion on benefits for Parts 121 (includingPart 125) and 135, the FAA believes that a share of the potential benefitsexpected to accure from implementation of this rule must be attributedto the Mode C rule, though to what extent is not known. This situationis due to the belief that the benefits of the TCAS and Mode C rules areinextricably linked.Comparison of Parts 121 and 135 Costs and BenefitsAddressing only 14 CFR Parts 121 and 135 costs and benefits of this TCASrule, the cost of compliance is estimated to be $563 million and $18 million,respectively (discounted) in 1987 dollars. The benefits of this rule, however,are difficult to quantify for two reasons. The first is associated withthe uncertainty of estimating the number of midair collisions that willoccur in the future absent any improvements in the airspace system overand above what currently exists. This difficulty has already been discussedat length in the detailed regulatory evaluation and the FAA has chosento consider ranges of 2 to 7 and 4 to 14 collisions involving Parts 121and 135 operators, respectively, may occur in the forecast period.The second reason benefits are difficult to forecast accurately is thatat about the same time this rule becomes effective a separate rule willbecome effective expanding Mode C requirements. Both rules are aimed atreducing the risk of midair collisions and are inextricably linked. TheFAA is unable at this time to document the separate impacts of these tworules in reducing the risk.The FAA made an earlier estimate of the dollar value benefits associatedwith avoiding future midair collisions as part of its evaluation of theMode C rule. That estimate was significantly lower than the updated estimateprepared for this rule. The difference is only partly explained by thefact that the Mode C rule estimate was for a 10-year period while the estimatefor this rule covers a 15-year period into the future (to allow for therelatively long periods before compliance is required).Both evaluations used a Poisson distribution model as a basis to estimatethe number of future midair collisions that might be expected in the absenceof any further airspace system improvements to prevent them. In the ModeC analysis, the FAA very conservatively accepted the low side of the distribution(two accidents) in calculating benefits. However, based on the belief thatU.S. commercial aircraft operations are forecast to more than double duringthe analysis period, the FAA now believes that a better approach is toanalyze a range of values.In view of the difficulties discussed above, the FAA believes that themost realistic approach to comparing benefits and costs is to compare thetotal Part 121 costs of the TCAS rule plus the Mode C rule with the fullestimated range of possible Part 121 benefits. In a similar manner, totalPart 135 TCAS rule plus Mode C rule are compared to the total range ofPart 135 benefits.In the case of Part 121 operator, the cost of the Mode C rule is negligiblebecause virtually all Part 121 aircraft are already in compliance withthe rule. Table 1 shows the cost of saving one life through the range ofestimated Part 121 midair collisions. As indicated in the table, thesecost-per-life-saved figures are based on an estimated total Part 121 TCAScost of $563 million and no attempt was made to allocate some benefitsto the Mode C rule.

Although theFAA has not yet quantified the value of public confidence in air transportation,it believes there is a very real cost to the system when public confidenceis reduced through media coverage of each major midair collision tragedy.The fragility of public confidence is difficult to quantify, but the potentialbenefits in this regard stemming from avoidance of a major midair collisionis very real and substantial. For example, the near-to-midair term lossof passenger bookings following the publicity of a midair collision isreadily acknowledged within the industry. Even a special Government safetyreview of a particular air carrier can have a temporary adverse impacton yields. The qualitative nature of this consideration does not renderit less significant as a factor in determining to proceed with the TCASrulemaking action.The Regulatory Impact Analysis that has been placed in the docket containsdetailed information related to the potential costs and benefits of thoseamendments to Parts 121, 125, and 135 that are expected to accrue fromimplementation of this rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Determination</ITAG>The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires a review of rules to assesstheir impact on small business. In consideration of the cost informationdiscussion under the Regulatory Impact Analysis, the FAA concludes thatthese amendments to Parts 121, 125, and 135 will have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities. However, the FAA findsthat there are no viable alternatives for small air carriers to adopt thatwill reduce the cost of compliance yet achieve the levels of protectionsought by these amendments. It can be pointed out, however, that the majorityof small entities affected by this rule are Part 135 operators (small airtaxis and small commuters). These small businesses will have 6 years tocomply with this rule (as opposed to 3 years for Parts 121 and 125 operators).The average total cost impact of this rule on a small air taxi operatoror small commuter for TCAS I units is estimated at $36,000 (or $4,700 annualized)and $76,000 (or $10,000 annualized), respectively, over the 15-year period1989 to 2003. For Parts 121 and 125 operators, the average total cost forTCAS II units is estimated to be $734,000 (or $96,000 annualized) overthe 15-year period.<ITAG tagnum="84">International Trade Impact Statement</ITAG>These amendments will have little or no impact on trade opportunities ofU.S. firms doing business overseas or for foreign firms doing businessin the United States. These rules will impose the same requirements onboth domestic operators under Parts 121, 125, and 135 of the FAR and foreignair carriers subject to Part 129. The cost of compliance with these ruleamendments to foreign carriers flying into the United States under Part129 is likely to be very similar to the cost incurred by domestic operators.Thus, neither domestic nor foreign air carriers will be affected disproportionatelyby these amendments. These rules, therefore, will not cause a competitivefare disadvantage for U.S. carriers operating overseas or for foreign carriersoperating in the United States.<ITAG tagnum="84">Federalism Implications</ITAG>The regulations adopted herein would not have substantial direct effectson the states, on the relationship between the national government andthe states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Thus, in accordance with Executive Order12612, it is determined that such regulations do not have federalism implicationswarranting the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.<ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusion</ITAG>For the reasons discussed in the preamble, and based on the findings inthe Regulatory Flexibility Determination, and the International Trade ImpactAnalysis, the FAA has determined that this rule is a major rule under ExecutiveOrder 12291. In addition, in consideration of the cost information discussionunder the Regulatory Impact Analysis, the amendments to Parts 121, 125,and 135 will have a significant economic impact on a substantial numberof small entities. This rule is considered significant under DOT RegulatoryPolicies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). A regulatoryimpact analysis of this final rule, including a Regulatory FlexibilityDetermination and International Trade Impact Analysis, has been placedin the docket.
