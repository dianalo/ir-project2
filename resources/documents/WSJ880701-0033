Urges Shareholders Not to Tender Stock </HL><SO> </SO><CO> FEXC ICH </CO><IN> TNM </IN><DATELINE> LOS ANGELES  </DATELINE><TEXT>   First Executive Corp. said its board determined that I.C.H. Corp.'s $12-a-share tender offer for 8.6% of First Executive's shares is &quot;inadequate&quot; and recommended that holders not tender any shares.    Fred Carr, First Executive's chairman, announced the board's recommendation at the insurance holding company's annual shareholders meeting here. Mr. Carr said that while the offer for 6.3 million shares represents a slight premium over the stock's current market price, it is less than earlier market prices and less than the company's net book value per share.    Officials of I.C.H., a Louisville, Ky.-based insurance holding company, couldn't be reached for comment. I.C.H., which already owns an 11.5% stake in First Executive, launched its tender offer earlier this month in an attempt to increase its stake to 20.1%. A stake of that size would allow I.C.H. to report a pro-rata share of First Executive's robust earnings as its own.    First Executive shares rose 12.5 cents yesterday to close at $11.875 each in national over-the-counter trading. First Executive made its announcement after the stock market closed.    In January, First Executive's board had adopted a neutral position on an earlier $12-a-share offer by I.C.H. for 11.2 million First Executive shares. Only 1.5 million shares were tendered and not withdrawn under that offer.    At the annual meeting yesterday, Mr. Carr also said First Executive has &quot;no present plans to take further action to forstall&quot; the current I.C.H. offer. Last November, I.C.H. agreed not to buy more than 25% of First Executive until 1992.    Mr. Carr also said First Executive is engaged in &quot;substantial discussions&quot; with two potential buyers of its New York unit. First Executive has been trying to sell the unit since last fall. Mr. Carr wouldn't name the company's asking price for the unit, but said he hopes that &quot;within the next few months we will be able to achieve our goals with respect to&quot; the unit. </TEXT></DOC>
