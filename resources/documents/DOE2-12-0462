We have obtained a comprehensive set of results ranging fromcircles to needles which can be well fit by the interpolation formulap/sub c/ = (1+4y)/(19+4y), where y = b/a+a/b. We also obtain resultsfor random centers and random orientations along the two principal directionswhich are virtually indistinguishable from the previous case. These resultsare used to critique the various effective-medium theories that havebeen developed for the electrical conductance and elastic moduli of sheetscontaining random elliptical inclusions. An interpolation formula isdeveloped that appears superior to all these effective-medium theories.</TEXT></DOC>
