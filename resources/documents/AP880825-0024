Each of the medical centers will recruit nine volunteers tofirst determine the vaccine's safety and its ability to produce animmune response.   There is no chance of contracting AIDS from the vaccine since itcontains no live or killed human immunodeficiency virus that causesthe deadly disease, the institute said Wednesday.   The volunteers must be healthy men or women who pass a bloodtest showing they are not infected with the virus that causes AIDSand ``who are not engaged in behavior that would place them at highrisk of contracting HIV,'' the institute said.   While the institute is conducting numerous research projects tofind effective drugs to treat HIV victims, this is only the secondvaccine to be approved for testing. The first study began a yearago.   ``We are quite a distance away from getting a vaccine that wouldbe approved for general use,'' said Elaine Baldwin, spokeswoman forthe institute. ``It is estimated we will not have an AIDS vaccineuntil the mid-1990s.''   The vaccine is produced by using live vaccinia virus, which hasbeen used for years as a smallpox vaccination. That disease has nowbeen wiped out worldwide.   At each of the six centers, six volunteers will receive the AIDSvaccine and three will receive vaccinia vaccine alone, as acontrol. Neither the volunteers nor the physicians conducting thetest will know which vaccine each person is receiving until data isanalyzed.   The medical centers that will conduct the studies are theUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore; Johns Hopkins University,Baltimore; Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tenn.; University ofRochester (New York); Baylor College of Medicine, Houston; andMarshall University, Huntington, W.Va.   Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome attacks the body's immunesystem, rendering it incapable of resisting other diseases andinfections. AIDS most often is spread through close contact withblood, blood products or semen from infected persons. Its chiefvictims have been homosexual men and intravenous drug users.   As of Monday, AIDS had been diagnosed in 71,171 Americans, ofwhom more than half, or 40,090, have died, according to the federalCenters for Disease Control. No one is known to have recovered fromAIDS.</TEXT></DOC>
