It is shown that both inside and outsidethe miscibility gap droplet of pure lead feature Brownian motion andcoagulate at a rate depending on the electron flux and the temperature.The evolution of the density of particle has been measured, and by usingthe coagulation theory of Smoluchowsky, the viscosity of the practicallypure B/sub 2/O/sub 3/ matrix has been obtained. The viscosity is drasticallyreduced by up to 10 orders of magnitude by irradiation. It is shown anddiscussed that this effect comes from electronic excitation but is muchmore important when atomic displacements are present.</TEXT></DOC>
