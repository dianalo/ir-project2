Snow and icy roads hampered drivers in the upper Midwest, butstatistics show states with warmer climates reported more trafficfatalities.   Figures compiled by The Associated Press show at least 387 peopledied on the nation's roads from Friday night through midnight Monday.   California reported 58 highway deaths, Florida 41 and Texas 33.   The Chicago-based National Safety Council had estimated between350 and 450 traffic deaths over the Christmas weekend. Last year 389people died, the council said.   Council statistician Barbara Carraro said the states showinghigher fatality numbers have large populations with more peoplelikely to drive when the roads are in good condition.   ``In the warmer climates, more people are out traveling, and inthe severe weather, not as many people were out,'' she said.   Minnesota, which got up to a foot of snow in the north Monday,reported only one traffic fatality over the weekend. Illinois, whichalso had a foot of snow in some suburbs, had nine fatalities.Indiana had 16.   During a normal non-holiday weekend in December, an estimated 380people die in road accidents, Ms. Carraro said.   The council projected the New Year's weekend road toll also wouldbe between 350 and 450.</TEXT></DOC>
