At the close of a two-day summit meeting here, the twoleaders took the unexpected step of declaring they willco-sponsor the Middle East conference even though Israelhasn't yet said it will attend such a gathering. Theyscheduled the conference for sometime in October.</LP><TEXT>   The two leaders presented the Middle East initiative as aproduct of what Mr. Gorbachev called the &quot;very warmatmosphere&quot; between the leaders of the former rivals now thatthe Cold War has passed. The Soviet president called theinitiative &quot;a very important result of our joint work.&quot;   Mr. Bush declared that there is an &quot;historic opportunityright now&quot; to launch a conference drawing together Israel andits Arab neighbors. In an apparent reference to privatecommunications in the last day with Israel, Mr. Bush said heis &quot;a little more optimistic&quot; that Israel will agree toattend.   By announcing plans for a peace conference, the U.S. andthe Soviets appear to be trying to put Israel in a positionwhere it can't refuse to take part. Syria and Jordan alreadyhave agreed to attend, but the Israelis have wavered, largelybecause they think they might be forced to sit down withPalestinians they deem unacceptable negotiating partners.Israel wants to avoid negotiating with Palestinians who areeither too close to the Palestine Liberation Organization orwho are from East Jerusalem, territory Israel has annexed andconsiders beyond negotiation.   The tough joint statement issued at the close of thesummit came in sharp contrast to cautious remarks by Sovietofficials before the meeting, when they warned it would becounterproductive to push the Israelis too far into a cornerin an attempt to force them to agree. Moscow has been engagedin intense behind-the-scenes contacts with the PLO in recentdays, seeking to overcome any obstacles about Palestinianrepresentation.   The statement said the two sides recognized &quot;that peacecannot be imposed and that it can only result from directnegotiations between the parties.&quot; In an apparent effort toease Israeli worries that they may be forced to negotiatewith Palestinians they find unacceptable, the statement saidformal invitations to the conference would be issued 10 daysbefore it is convened, giving the Israelis or other parties achance to back out.   Mr. Bush said he is sending Secretary of State James Bakerto Israel today to &quot;obtain Israel's answer&quot; to the peaceconference proposal. It isn't clear where the conferencewould be held. U.S. officials had once considered Cairo alikely spot, but Israel has frowned on that idea. It'spossible the conference could be in Washington, but some U.S.officials prefer neutral sites in Europe.   Mr. Bush's new foreign policy triumphs come at a time whenhis overall job-approval ratings in the polls, though stillhigh, have begun to recede. In a new Wall Street Journal/NBCNews poll, 67% of registered voters approve of thepresident's performance, compared with 76% a month earlier.The latest figure is the lowest for the president sinceDecember.   Economic issues appear to account for the decline. Thesurvey, conducted by pollsters Peter Hart, a Democrat, andRobert Teeter, a Republican, found that 52% disapprove of thejob Mr. Bush is doing in handling the economy, while only 38%approve. In the June Journal/NBC poll, 48% disapproved and47% approved.   On foreign policy, 74% approve of Mr. Bush's job and 21%disapprove -- figures that are unchanged from a month ago.The poll was conducted Friday through Monday among 1,004registered voters nationwide.   In the showpiece event of the summit, held in St.Vladimir's Hall of the Kremlin, the two leaders signed anagreement on reducing their strategic nuclear arsenals. TheStrategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or Start, which was almost10 years in the making, is the first U.S.-Soviet accord thatreduces the number of strategic nuclear missiles, rather thanjust limiting their growth. It was hailed as a landmark byboth leaders.   Mr. Gorbachev said the two nations are moving toward &quot;thedismantling of the infrastructure of fear that has ruled theworld.&quot; Mr. Bush said the 700-page treaty &quot;vindicates anapproach to arms control that guided us for almost a decade:the belief that we could do more than merely halt the growthof our nuclear arsenals.&quot;   The treaty attempts to set equal ceilings on the strategicnuclear forces maintained by the U.S. and the Soviets, and inmany important categories it requires deeper cuts on theSoviet side. But the treaty falls short of the goal set outby the Reagan administration of cutting strategic arsenals50%. In the end, the U.S. stockpile of missiles and bombersthat deliver strategic warheads will be cut 29%, while theSoviet arsenal will be cut 36%. And because of the steadybuildup of nuclear arms during the decade the treaty wasbeing negotiated, the cuts simply will scale the size of thestrategic arsenals back to roughly where they were when talksbegan.   The treaty sets a limit of 1,600 on so-called strategicnuclear delivery vehicles, which are intercontinentalballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles andheavy bombers that deliver strategic nuclear weapons. Becauseof vagueries in the treaty's counting rules and provisionsexcluding certain weapons, it isn't certain precisely howmany strategic warheads each side will have when the treatyis fully implemented. But the Arms Control Association, anindependent research organization, estimates that the U.S.will retain 9,000 strategic warheads, while the Soviets willhave 7,000.   U.S. officials are most pleased that the treaty fulfills alongtime goal of getting the Soviets to slash their biggestland-based missiles, the weapons most dangerous to the U.S.The Soviet arsenal of 10-warhead SS-18 missiles will be cutin half.   When analysts sort through all its technical complexities,the accord is likely to face detractors in both the U.S. andthe U.S.S.R. -- something Mr. Gorbachev noted in his briefremarks at the signing ceremony. &quot;In both countries, we facethe complex process of the ratification of the new treaty.There will be critics,&quot; he said, referring to those who mightthink the agreement went too far and to those who consideredit too timid.   U.S. critics could complain that the treaty gives theSoviets too much latitude to modernize their existingmissiles and that it allows them to keep their mobilestrategic missiles, which are difficult to monitor.   For its part, the Soviet military is already angry athaving to endure sweeping cutbacks over the past three years,and its top brass have increasingly been expressing theirgrievances in public. Just last week, one leading generalsaid the army is &quot;seriously concerned&quot; about Mr. Gorbachev'sdefense policies.   But the Start agreement won surprising support from anunlikely quarter. A lengthy analysis in the SovietskayaRossiya newspaper, usually a mouthpiece for the grumbling ofthe military, found several reasons for the Soviets tocelebrate the signing of the treaty. Headlined &quot;A Victory forReason,&quot; the article noted that the Soviets stood to benefitfrom some provisions, including those that enable them toretain mobile missiles and force the U.S. to reduce the rangeof air-launched cruise missiles allowed under the treaty.   &quot;Readers shouldn't get the impression that the agreementis ideal, however,&quot; the paper cautioned. &quot;Of course, thereare serious shortcomings,&quot; it said, particularly the treaty'sfailure to reduce arsenals &quot;to a level foreseen in ourcurrent military doctrine.&quot;   Despite the summit's emphasis on growing cooperationbetween the U.S. and the U.S.S.R., there were points ofcontention. One is how far the countries should now go towardfurther arms reductions following the Start treaty. Mr.Gorbachev said he sees Start as merely the beginning of alonger process designed to end what he called &quot;the absurdityof overarmament.&quot;   &quot;Our next goal is to make full use of this breakthrough tomake disarmament an irreversible process,&quot; Mr. Gorbachevsaid. Mr. Bush was much more guarded.   Most of the economic issues between the U.S. and theSoviet Union were hashed out Tuesday, on the summit's firstday. But Mr. Gorbachev suggested that the two leaders madefurther progress yesterday on one lingering issue. He saidthat Mr. Bush has agreed to review the list ofhigh-technology items that the U.S. bans from export to theSoviet Union because they have potential militaryapplications. For the second day in a row, Mr. Gorbachevcomplained that the list is blocking completion of bigbusiness deals that could help the Soviet economy.   The atmosphere between the two leaders was so chummy thatthey even avoided squabbling over the thorny issue of theBaltics, the three republics annexed by Stalin in 1940, whoseindependence the U.S. has long backed. Tuesday night, sixLithuanians were killed and two injured in an attack on aborder post by assailants, in the latest upsurge of violencein the area. Lithuanian authorities immediately suspected theattack was the work of &quot;black beret&quot; Interior Ministrytroops, who have attacked other border posts in recentmonths. This was denied by the Interior Ministry in Moscow.   Seeking to play down the issue, President Bush seemedsatisfied with an assurance by Mr. Gorbachev that theincident would be thoroughly investigated and that &quot;we aredoing everything in order to . . . avoid such excesses.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
