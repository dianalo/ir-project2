JamesStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 10/30/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> USGTENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM)CONSTRUCTION, MATERIALS (CON) </IN><TEXT>   A partnership controlled by Texas oilmen Cyril Wagner Jr. and Jack E. Brown said it could offer more than $50 a share, or more than $2.5 billion, for USG Corp. But Chicago-based USG countered by suing to stop the Texans from buying any more of its shares.    In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, the partnership -- Desert Partners has a 9.9% stake in USG -- said the oilmen met with company officials Wednesday and indicated to them that &quot;it would be possible&quot; to pay more than $50 a share for USG in a friendly transaction. But the oilmen added that, while they still want to structure some form of takeover, no &quot;substantive negotiations&quot; have occurred, and no more talks are scheduled.    In Chicago, USG, a building-products company, filed a lawsuit in federal district court against Messrs. Wagner and Brown and their Wagner andamp; Brown partnership, alleging the defendants violated federal securities laws. Among its charges, USG said the defendants misrepresented discussions with USG officers as well as their plans for USG.    The suit also named among its defendants Desert Partners. The suit described the defendants as having &quot;a long history of reaping enormous profits by directing and participating in schemes to put publicly held companies 'in play.'&quot; The suit said the Texas investors buy substantial stakes in companies, then sell them at high premiums, a practice known as greenmail.    The company asked the court to block any further purchases of USG stock by the the defendants and to order the Texas investors to relinquish control of the shares they now own. Messrs. Wagner and Brown declined to comment because they hadn't seen the suit yet.    While the partnership's disclosure sent USG stock rocketing up $9.50 a share in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, many on Wall Street were discounting the Texas partnership's chances of success. USG's stock closed at $37.50, far below the more than $50 a share that Messrs. Wagner and Brown suggested they could offer in a negotiated transaction.    Takeover traders cited widespread doubts about both the partnership's willingness and ability to finance a big takeover.    &quot;USG is way up, but we wouldn't buy it,&quot; said one arbitrager. &quot;There's no offer. It's too ephemeral.&quot;    In any case, the partnership was able to recoup a substantial part of its paper loss in USG resulting from the stock market crash. The oilmen, who purchased their USG shares at an average per-share price of about $44.50, realized a paper gain of about $48 million as USG stock shot up after their announcement. Even so, in the wake of the market crash, they still have an indicated paper loss of about $35 million on their $226 million USG investment. USG has 51.3 million shares outstanding.    The partners' ability to finance a takeover of USG is uncertain at best. Earlier this week, the partners said they are in talks with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. and commercial banks about financing for a takeover. But some takeover players doubt many Wall Street firms would commit to such a large transaction while financial markets remain in disarray and doubts about the direction of interest rates persist. A spokeswoman for the partnership declined immediate comment on the partnership's financing ability.    Messrs. Wagner and Brown have in the past sold their stock back to target companies after similar saber rattling. USG, meanwhile, hasn't shied away from such payments, having bought back a 4.9% stake from the Belzberg brothers last year. A person close to the two parties, however, said such a payment hasn't been discussed. &quot;Buying (Messrs. Wagner and Brown) out is something that no one has suggested,&quot; the person said.    ---   Frank E. James in Chicago contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
