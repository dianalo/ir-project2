The West Berlin-based pharmaceutical and chemical companyadded that the rise could be achieved despite the dilutingimpact of a 5% stock dividend and the exercise of stockoptions.</LP><TEXT>   A spokeswoman said, however, Schering hasn't altered itsprevious forecast that net income for the year will aboutmatch 1989's 225 million marks. Schering had 5.85 billionmarks in sales last year.   The discrepancy between the outlook for higher per-shareearnings and flat profit can be explained by the fact thatper-share earnings reported by West German companies aren'tequivalent to profit.   Instead, they are calculated according to guidelines setby the German Association of Securities Analysts, whicheliminate extraordinary items and allocations to reservesfrom per-share earnings. Profit data reported by West Germanconcerns can be misleading because the companies usually makeoverly generous allocations to nontaxable reserves.</TEXT></DOC>
