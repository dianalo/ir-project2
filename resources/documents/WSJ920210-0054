Lane Packing Co. of Fort Valley, one of Georgia'slargest peach harvesters and packers, was raided byImmigration and Naturalization Service agents last June. Morethan 130 illegal aliens were apprehended and deported, andfour Lane employees were arrested on smuggling charges. Theemployees have since been convicted.   An attorney said the company would appeal the fine.</LP><TEXT>   INS investigators said that for at least two years, thesmuggling venture ran 250 alien workers each month to Laneoperations in Georgia and to other harvesters in Florida andNorth Carolina. Workers were recruited in the interior ofMexico.   The smugglers would typically collect from each worker a$1,000 transportation fee, $400 for illegal documentation and$50-a-month rent -- for housing in cramped shacks with poorsanitation and no air conditioning, said INS Atlanta DistrictDirector Thomas P. Fischer. Workers were paid about $4 anhour.   &quot;They had these individuals, both men and women, in theirlittle bondage-type operation,&quot; he said at a news conference.&quot;They had them with the rent, they had them with the falsecards, they probably used the threat of calling immigration&quot;to have troublemakers deported.</TEXT></DOC>
