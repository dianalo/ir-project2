Then itfires off its sales pitch.   &quot;Dear -------,&quot; the letter begins. &quot;Your recent DUI{driving under the influence} conviction was indeedunfortunate. But it needn't happen again. The Pro-Techalcohol breath analyzer was designed for people likeyourself. . . .&quot;</LP><TEXT>   For imbibers, in other words, who want to stay out ofjail. &quot;Most of those people won't stop drinking,&quot; saysCommunidyne President Roger Gerber, who designed thehand-held alcohol detector. He says he has sold 4,000 of thescreening devices in the U.S. since introducing them in May.   It isn't just the drinkers themselves he aims at for salesof the Pro-Tech 1000, which is roughly the size of ahalf-pint whiskey bottle. Other targets are oil, constructionand trucking companies, detox centers, police departments,probation officers and bars. A Napa Valley winery bought onedevice to curb overzealous wine tasters. A high-schoolcounselor in New York displays one on his desk to discouragestudent imbibing.   The 48-year-old Northbrook, Ill., entrepreneur andpart-time ostrich farmer also sells a coin-operated talkingbreathanalysis machine to bars. He claims a slew of marketingsuccesses dating back to the 1960s, but thinks the Pro-Techmight be his biggest hit. Consumers, he says, like its size,price (less than $200) and the meter that shows how pickledthey are.   Not everybody thinks it's a great idea. Jeffrey Hon, anofficial with the National Council on Alcoholism and DrugDependence, based in Washington, D.C., says his organizationwould refuse to endorse any product that might give a drinkera false sense of security. &quot;We believe that any amount ofalcohol can impair your driving,&quot; he says.   But Mr. Gerber says his product saves lives by dissuadingdrinkers who might otherwise get behind the wheel. He sayshis customers include law-enforcement agencies and even theSalvation Army. (A sheriff's department in Illinois complainsabout some of the device's design features but says it's &quot;avery useful tool&quot; and accurate to within the 5% margin oferror that the company claims for it.)   Mr. Gerber, perhaps understandably, scorns alternativescreening methods. Blood analysis? Time-consuming andexpensive. Saliva? Unreliable. Urine? &quot;Too easy to cheat,&quot; hesays.</TEXT></DOC>
