SeibStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 05/05/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   This week's political imbroglio involving former Sen. Gary Hart and a Miami woman endangers the presidential campaign of the Democratic frontrunner.    The incident highlights the importance of character issues in the 1988 race and raises questions of the interplay of the personal and public lives of political figures, especially Mr. Hart.    A team of Miami Herald reporters wrote in the newspaper's Sunday edition that the woman spent Friday night with Mr. Hart in his Washington townhouse -- an allegation vehemently denied by the Hart campaign. The woman, later identified as Donna Rice, a part-time actress, also refuted the report.    The allegation comes at a time when Mr. Hart, who is married and has built a strong lead in political polls, was trying to put to rest questions about his character -- and the widespread speculation that he was, in his words, a &quot;womanizer.&quot; The story was published just as the poll for the Iowa presidential caucuses was showing him with the support of 65% of the state's Democrats followed by the Rev. Jesse Jackson with 9%.    &quot;Unless there's some way for him to demonstrate propriety, this is going to hurt him,&quot; says Arthur Davis, a former Democratic Party chairman in Iowa. &quot;And even if it can be proved that nothing happened, a lot of people here are going to say it shows bad judgment.&quot;    The story and the method used to report it also are prompting unusually contentious debates in political and journalistic circles. But however the philosophical and press issues are resolved, the story poses formidable challenges for the Hart presidential campaign.    Hart strategists are criticizing the Miami Herald's techniques, which involved assigning a team of reporters to stake out the candidate's home, but failing to continuously watch the back door of the townhouse. And they assert that the campaign will not be diverted by the questions surrounding the episode.    &quot;The burden of proof lies with the Miami Herald, and they still haven't substantiated the charges,&quot; says Kevin Sweeney, the campaign press secretary. &quot;Eventually, people are going to say 'enough is enough.' We're going to treat it as background noise.&quot;    The newspaper acknowledged in yesterday's editions that there were &quot;opportunities&quot; for Miss Rice to leave the Hart residence unnoticed through the back door between midnight and 5 a.m. Saturday.    But Heath Meriwether, executive editor of the Miami Herald, said reporters had the back door &quot;pretty much covered&quot; after that. Besides, he added, the Herald team saw Mr. Hart and Miss Rice enter or leave the townhouse together three different times Friday and Saturday nights, and then conducted an interview in which Mr. Hart, 50 years old, acknowledged making occasional calls to the woman while traveling. Mr. Hart's wife, Lee, was in Denver on those days.    The gravest element of this crisis for the Hart campaign is that details of his version of the incident are difficult to prove. The Hart campaign contends that Miss Rice was in Washington to accompany a friend being interviewed for a job, and that she didn't spend the night in Mr. Hart's home -- a contention confirmed by Miss Rice in an interview yesterday with the Associated Press and two other news organizations. &quot;If there was anything going on, we would have been cautious, but we had nothing to hide. Nobody did,&quot; she said.    &quot;I am assuming very heavy political damage here,&quot; says James Gannon, editor of the Des Moines Register. &quot;If I were a Hart supporter I'd be very angry with him today for taking that sort of risk.&quot;    Some political figures say the Hart campaign still has time to recover, particularly if the Herald's charges aren't substantiated further. &quot;An awful lot of undecided people haven't begun to focus on the race and won't do so for months,&quot; says Joseph Grandmaison, chairman of the state Democratic Party in New Hampshire, site of the first presidential primary. &quot;Sure, this isn't helpful for Hart, but there's a tendency in politics to make a serious political error in predicting your opponent's demise.&quot;    The latest developments, however, make it more difficult than ever for Mr. Hart, who prides himself on conducting a campaign of ideas, to prevail or fail on the strength of those ideas alone. The incident adds to the uncertainty that many Hart supporters feel even now, 10 months before the first political tests of the election year. And they make it harder still to attract new support.    &quot;A lot of uncommitted voters,&quot; says a top Iowa party official, &quot;just decided who they aren't voting for.&quot;    The significance this story has assumed underlines the increasing importance of the personal lives of political figures. &quot;People want leaders who project leaderlike traits in many of their behaviors, not just their public behavior,&quot; says Richard Winters, a political scientist at Dartmouth College.    At the same time, New York University sociologist Richard Sennett, who has written about the erosion of the boundary between public and private lives, worries that measuring politicians' fitness &quot;by the state of their personal lives is a terrible test.&quot; He adds: &quot;We take minute details of a person's private life and make it seem symbolic of something very important. Often, that's not the case.&quot;    Former Sen. George McGovern, the 1972 Democratic nominee who employed Mr. Hart as his campaign manager, added: &quot;It's going to be a demeaning process, both for the candidates and the press, if we get into the practice of stakeouts to try to determine who has the purest sex life.&quot;    Some journalists think that the Miami Herald rushed its story into print, relying on one episode. &quot;At least in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, if we were onto a story like that and wanted to do it, the story would have to be based on more than a single incident,&quot; says Mark Bowden, state editor of the Cedar Rapids Gazette.    And even observers who think the Miami Herald's story and tactics were justified suspect there eventually may be a public backlash against the press, which could be accused of voyeurism and rumormongering. &quot;What we're going to see is one more blast at the press, which I feel is inappropriate now,&quot; says Stephen Hess, a scholar who studies press issues at Washington's Brookings Institution.    Still, such stories about a candidate &quot;tell you something about the person that voters have a right to know,&quot; asserts Michael G. Gartner, editor of the Louisville (Ky.) Courier-Journal and president of the American Society of Newspaper Editors. &quot;Didn't Hart issue a challenge to reporters to follow him? And they did it. They didn't break any laws. They didn't do anything unethical.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
