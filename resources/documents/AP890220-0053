A misdemeanor court acquitted Mohammed Rashid, 39, and returnedhim to Korydallos prison, where he has been jailed since his arrestin Piraeus in May.   ``I had it (the knife) because I fear for my life. I also fearthey may extradite me to the United States,'' Rashid told reportersin the courtroom.   Prison guards found the handmade stiletto and a file in Rashid'scell during a random search of his prison cell on Friday.   ``I don't think the objects found in his cell could really beused to harm anyone,'' prosecutor Zacharias Kokkinakis told thecourt.   The three-member panel of judges acted on the prosecutor'ssuggestion and voted 2-1 in favor of acquitting Rashid.   A bomb threat during the hearing forced authorities to evacuatethe courthouse, which was surrounded by dozens of police andsecurity officers armed with submachine guns. The court sessionresumed after a one-hour break.   Rashid is wanted by U.S. authorities on charges of planting abomb aboard a Pan Am jet over Hawaii. A teen-ager was killed and 15people were injured in the blast.   The Greek Supreme Court twice has delayed a decision on whetherto extradite Rashid. The case was further delayed last month whenthree Supreme Court judges resigned after a terrorist groupresponsible for killing a Supreme Court prosecutor threatened to actagainst court officials if Rashid were extradited.</TEXT></DOC>
