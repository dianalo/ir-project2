Officials of 500 model communes nationwide discussed localdefenses in the May 16-19 conference in Phnom Penh, also attendedby top party and state leaders including President Heng Samrin andPrime Minister Hun Sen, the official SPK news agency said in areport seen Saturday.   An earlier official radio broadcast said Hun Sen exhorted thecommune leaders to increase cooperation between military and policeforces, strengthen the propaganda campaign, and grant clemency tothose who abandon the guerrilla movement.   The local militia in particular must be strengthened, he said.   Hun Sen and Heng Samrin also called for efforts to improvevillagers' livelihoods by increasing rice production in the comingrainy season.   The Phnom Penh government was installed by Vietnam after itinvaded the country in late 1978 and is backed by thousands ofVietnamese troops in fighting three main guerrilla groups.   The conference was convened in response to increased attacks andundercover operations mounted by the largest guerrilla group, theKhmer Rouge.   Vietnamese forces wiped out all guerrilla bases along theThai-Cambodian border in 1984-85 but since then the rebels havere-established their positions.   The Khmer Rouge ruled Cambodia from 1975 until the Vietnameseinvasion and were responsible for the deaths of millions duringtheir radical communist regime.   In a preview of the conference, Phnom Penh's official CommunistParty paper Pracheachon (The People) said the party's rulingPolitburo ``considers the localities as a matter of life and deathto the revolution ... as the core battlefield, and the work ofbuilding and consolidating the localities, villages, communes,units and army bases as the key task in 1988.''   Khmer Rouge guerrillas, the paper said, were spreadingpropaganda in the villages, planting `'secret agents,'' andpreparing for 1990, when Vietnam has said it will withdraw the lastof its troops from Cambodia.   It said while Phnom Penh was able to counter pyschologicalwarfare in the interior of the country, the guerrillas wereinfiltrating a number of remote villages and communes along theCambodian-Thai border and intimidating people there ``withimpunity.''   In these areas, it said, living conditions are primitive,security forces don't support the people in attacking theguerrillas, and some villagers are even helping the guerrillas.</TEXT></DOC>
