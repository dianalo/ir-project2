(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The state hierarchy of the Assemblies ofGod church Monday ordered television evangelist Jimmy Swaggart toimmediately begin a two-year rehabilitation period that will limithis preaching and place him in counseling, an official said.   Louisiana District supervisor Cecil Janway announced the action,which could be modified by the national organization, after morethan nine hours of meetings with Swaggart, who was accused ofsexual miscounduct and admitted Sunday to unspecified sins.   ``The following action has been taken by the board of theLouisiana District of the Assemblies of God concerning evangelistJimmy Swaggart: We accept his confession of specific incidents of amoral failure,'' Janway said.   ``Based on his detailed confession and the evidence we observedof true humility and repentance, we have offered himrehabilitation, in accordance with the bylaws of the generalcouncil and Louisiana District of the Assemblies of God,'' he said.   ``Brother Swaggart has submitted to the terms ofrehabilitation,'' he said.   Swaggart made no comment as he left the meeting. He was whiskedaway by guards and left in a van, later flying home to Baton Rouge.   Janway told reporters that Swaggart will be prohibited frompreaching a minimum of three months, ``except in fulfillment ofpresent commitments involving foreign governments during thatperiod.'' He did not elaborate.   Earlier, Janway had said the regional board would report itsfindings privately to the general council of the country's largestPentecostal denomination, based in Springfield, Mo.   He declined to answer questions after reading his statement,saying ``No comment'' when asked if the action announced Mondaywould require further action from church officials in Missouri.   Everett Stenhouse, assistant general superintendent of thedenomination, said the action will now be referred to the executivepresbytery in Springfield to ``be approved or sent down formodification.'' A March 29 meeting is scheduled, but ``it'spossible for us to meet sooner,'' he said.   National Assemblies of God officials had met with Swaggart lastweek.   Janway said Swaggart would be relieved of his duties asco-pastor of the Family Worship Center in Baton Rouge, but he wouldbe allowed to return to preaching after three months. Jim Rentz,co-pastor with Swaggart at the worship center, earlier had said hewould assume duties as chief pastor of the church.   Swaggart did not describe his misconduct Sunday in hisconfession, which drew gasps and tears from his congregation.   An overflow crowd packed his 7,500-seat family worship centerafter reports that church officials had been given photographspurporting to show Swaggart and a known prostitute going into andout of a motel room.   The evangelist flew here from his headquarters in Baton Rouge onMonday for the meeting with the district presbytery of theAssemblies of God.   In his announcement after that meeting, Janway said Swaggartwould be counseled and supervised weekly by three members of theLouisiana District Presbytery during the rehabilitation period. Hewill be required to submit quarterly and monthly reports to churchofficials, Janway said.   ``Again no doubt, much speculation and rumor will find its wayinto the secular media, but for the church, the body of Christ,such speculation and rumor has no place,'' he said.   ``We urge Brother Swaggart and his associates to resist therequest of those outside the church to respond to questions.Brother Swaggart has been in complete cooperation with theAssemblies of God and has pledged with work within the structure ofthe church,'' Janway said.   The photographs allegedly showing Swaggart with a prostitutereportedly were given to church officials by New Orleans evangelistMarvin Gorman, who had once filed a $90 million suit againstSwaggart, claiming Swaggart had unjustly accused him of numerousaffairs. ``I know they exist and they're relevant,'' Gorman'sattorney Hunter Lundy said of the photographs.   The Washington Post reported Monday, quoting a source who spoketo a Jimmy Swaggart World Ministries board member, that Swaggartsaid he did not engage in sexual intercourse with the woman but``paid her to perform pornographic acts.''   One church official said Swaggart had confessed that his sexualmisconduct had continued for years.   ``He tried and tried and tried through prayer and fasting andeverything he could do to lick it and it beat him,'' the Rev. GlenCole, pastor of the Capital Christian Center in Sacramento, Calif.,told a Sacramento television station on Sunday. Cole is one of 13denomination officials that examined Swaggart's case last week.   ``He confessed to specific incidents of moral failure,'' ForestH. Hall, secretary-treasurer of the Assemblies' Louisiana District,told Swaggart's congregation. ``In the opinion of the officers ofthe Louisiana District, he has shown true humility and repentanceand has not tried to blame anyone else for his failure.''   The denomination's role is limited to disciplining Swaggart, butas in the case of PTL, it has no control over the televisionministry.   Eleven months ago, Swaggart scathingly denounced fellowAssemblies of God evangelist Jim Bakker for committing adultery,comparing him to a cancer that had to be excised.   Bakker, who resigned from his PTL ministry in March afteradmitting to an extramarital sexual encounter with church secretaryJessica Hahn and being defrocked by the denomination, had blamedSwaggart for bringing his misconduct to light.   Swaggart had worked last summer to develop an ethics code forbroadcast ministries to stem a drop-off in donations caused by thesex and money scandal at the PTL ministry under Bakker's reign.   With tears streaming down his face, Swaggart said Sunday he wasstepping down from the pulpit ``for an undetermined, indeterminateperiod of time. We will leave that in the hands of the Lord.''   He said he was cooperating with the Assemblies' investigation.   ``I do not plan in any way to whitewash my sin or call it amistake,'' he said. ``I call it sin.''   Ministry officials had refused to comment on the future ofSwaggart's television program, which is videotaped at his regularSunday service and distributed in more than 100 countries.   Swaggart, a cousin of rock 'n' roll pioneer Jerry Lee Lewis andcountry singer Mickey Gilley, combined his singing and pianoplaying with old-fashioned, fire-and-brimstone preaching to build aministry with an income estimated at $142 million in 1986.</TEXT></DOC>
