WILLIAMS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Although the superpowers profess tohave no fear of a reunited Germany, Europeans on both sides of theEast-West divide are growing increasingly nervous at the prospectof a German giant in their midst.   NATO and Warsaw Pact lawmakers who met here this week to discusspolitical changes indicated that Europeans, afraid of the rise of anew dominant power on the continent, may be more comfortable withthe status quo of two Germanys.   East Germany's new leader, Egon Krenz, quashed the prospect of areunited Germany in the near future when he told reporters inMoscow that ``division is an element of our European security.''   But French President Francois Mitterrand, at the end of atwo-day summit in Bonn with Chancellor Helmut Kohl, said today thathe deemed the desire for a reunified state as a legitimate goal.   ``No responsible politician in Europe can ponder the futurewithout taking this into consideration,'' Mitterrand told a newsconference. ``It is a phenomenon that will dominate the end of thiscentury.''   Mitterrand's comments were the most tolerant by a leading Frenchpolitician to date on the subject.   West German officials and scholars say the mass demonstrationssweeping the Communist state could lead some day to the kinds ofreforms that would allow East Germans to reconsider their separatestatus.   The East German state under Communist Party control ``has neverbeen accepted by the people,'' said Burkhard Dobiey, head of theGerman Policy department of the federal Inter-German AffairsMinistry in Bonn.   ``If they decide that as Germans they would like to be with us,for instance, we have to accept that. This is in our Constitution.''   Dobiey's comments came during a three-day discussion betweenlawmakers from the East and West sponsored by the North AtlanticAssembly, an advisory body to the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization.   The long-dormant idea of a reunified Germany has beenrevitalized in recent months by the flight of tens of thousands ofEast Germans disillusioned with conditions in their country.   President Bush said in an interview with The New York Times lastweek that he doesn't ``share the concern that some Europeancountries have about a reunified Germany.''   But European parliamentarians at the East-West roundtable didindeed show discomfort. They pressed the West Germans to explaintheir intentions.   ``We are very much concerned about the impact the rapprochementof the two Germanys might have on the European Community,'' saidLoic Bouvard, a French parliament member.   Pieter Maris of the Netherlands' Parliament noted the thornyproblems of bringing together two Germanys belonging to oppositepolitical and defense camps. He asked the West Germans to explainwhat they see as ``the last step.''   West European unease with talk of reunification likely reflectsconcern about the emergence of an overpowering economy as much assecurity questions.   Joining the two states would boost the population to more than75 million, and expand the industrial base of what is alreadyEurope's strongest economy, West Germany.   Some East European states, like Czechoslovakia, view efforts atreunification as a drive powered by a revengeful spirit on the partof the Germans to reclaim territory lost in World War II.   The Kremlin, however, has signaled through envoys abroad itwould pose no barriers to East Germany's departure from the WarsawPact if the populace so decided.   ``Everything is up to the Germans,'' the Bonn-based daily DieWelt quoted Nikolai Shishlin, head of the Communist Party CentralCommittee's East European department, as saying in Washington.   The newspaper also quoted Yevgeny Primakov, head of the lowerhouse of the Supreme Soviet, as telling CBS television the Kremlinhas no objections to the departure of any of its allies from theWarsaw Pact.   Istvan Gyarmati, a deputy foreign minister of Hungary and anegotiator at the Vienna-based conventional arms talks, saidEuropeans would accept reunification if existing military blocswere dissolved.   Jerzy Golaczynski, head of the national defense committee inPoland's Sejm, or parliament, said his nation recognizes the rightof both East Germany and West Germany to determine their ownfutures.   ``But it has been made clear at this conference thatreunification is not just a concern for Germany, but for all ofEurope and the world,'' Golaczynski said. ``The concerns ofGermany's neighbors must also be kept in view.''   While Poland and West Germany have made major advancements intheir relations recently, and Kohl will visit Warsaw next week, itwas Poland that suffered first at the hands of Nazi Germany 50years ago.   Resistance remains strong in Poland to reunification and to amilitarily and economically strong Germany rising again on thewestern border.</TEXT></DOC>
