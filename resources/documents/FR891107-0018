A final rule published on October 19, 1987(52 FR 38864) replaced the 1986 proposed rule and program requirementsand continues to govern the use and reallocation of funds appropriatedfor the 1986 ESG program.On July 22, 1987, the President approved the Stewart B. McKinney HomelessAssistance Act (Pub. L. 100-77) (the 1987 McKinney Act) reauthorizing,with amendment, the Emergency Shelter Grants program. A proposed rule forthe 1987 ESG program was published on November 6, 1987 (52 FR 42664), anda final rule was published on August 10, 1988 (54 FR 30186). The finalrule is codified at 24 CFR part 576.Subsequently, the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Amendments Act(Pub. L. 100-620, approved November 7, 1988) (the 1988 McKinney Act) wasenacted, amending several of the requirements in the 1987 McKinney Act.In accordance with section 485 of the 1988 McKinney Act, the Departmentimplemented the 1988 amendments by a Notice providing for immediate effect(published January 9, 1989, 54 FR 750). The Notice, which solicited publiccomment, is the basis for the amendments to 24 CFR part 576 contained inthis final rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Public Comments and Changes Made in the Final Rule</ITAG>I. Response to Public CommentsThe Department received two public comments in response to its January9, 1989 ESG notice implementing the 1988 McKinney Act amendments, one fromNew York City and the other from the City of Boston.New York City commented on the change that requires States, Territories,formula cities and counties, and other units of general local governmentto assume responsibility for the environmental review. The commenter contendsthat HUD's environmental review procedures in 24 CFR part 58, for whichthe applicants described above are required to assume responsibility, aretoo time-consuming and strict, causing delays in beginning construction.New York City believes that there should be a provision for a waiver ofcompliance with HUD procedures for applicants that are subject to otherstate and local environmental review requirements.Section 482 of the 1988 McKinney Act provides that the regulations andprocedures applicable under section 104(g) of the Housing and CommunityDevelopment Act of 1974 are to be applied to the Emergency Shelter Grantsprogram. Section 104(g) authorizes HUD to assign the Federal environmentalresponsibilities to grantees deemed to have the legal capacity for environmentalreview (States, metropolitan cities, urban counties, and other units ofgeneral local government) and to define how the responsibilities are tobe performed. The regulations at 24 CFR part 58 describe the requirementsfor grantees that assume the responsibilities.The 1988 McKinney Act recognizes that the objectives of the Emergency ShelterGrants program are best served by a consolidation of environmental reviewresponsibilities at the applicant level. Many applicants seek funding underother McKinney Act programs, and a single environmental review should oftensuffice for those applicants. According to the Report of the House Committeeon Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs, the intent of section 482 of the1988 McKinney Act was to expedite the consideration of applications. However,the Report states that the Committee expects all applicants to adhere toall requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and that``this amendment does not lessen any requirement for any project to complywith the NEPA standards.'' (See H.R. Rep. No. 100-718 , Part II, 100thCong., 2d Sess. 39 (1988).)The requirements of statutes, Executive Orders, and the regulations ofoversight agencies that are imposed on applicants through part 58 cannotbe waived. Those that are regulatory, i.e., the Council on EnvironmentalQuality NEPA regulations (40 CFR parts 1500-1508) and the Advisory Councilon Historic Preservation regulations (36 CFR part 800), make some provisionfor ``emergencies,'' but these are for conditions more extreme than a concernfor processing delays. Compliance with the review process and time periodsunder the authorities listed in 24 CFR 58.5 is mandatory_whether responsibilityfor review is assigned to the applicant under section 104(g) or retainedand exercised by HUD under 24 CFR part 50. In addition, HUD does not havethe discretion to substitute State or local environmental requirementsfor the Federal requirements.In andSection; 576.52, the final rule clarifies that applicants assumingresponsibility for environmental reviews may arrange for local governmentswith the appropriate technical capability to conduct the technical review,as long as the applicants still retain all legal responsibilities, <T3>i.e.,</T3> independently evaluate information submitted and assumeresponsibility for its accuracy, scope, and content and carry out any mitigationmeasures called for by the review. Applicants may also adopt prior reviewsconducted by HUD or another governmental unit if the reviews meet the particularrequirements of the Federal environmental law or authority under whichthey would be adopted, and only under certain conditions (<T3>e.g.,</T3> a determination that no environmentally significant changeshave occurred since the review was done.)The City of Boston had a number of comments on definitions used in theEmergency Shelter grants program. Although these definitions are containedin the August 10, 1988 ESG final rule (codified at 24 CFR part 576), andnot in the January 9, 1989 Notice published for comment, the Departmenthas nevertheless considered these comments.Boston claimed that the definition of ``conversion'' (andSection; 576.3 ofthe final rule) is unclear, since it fails to state whether a change inthe use of a building to an emergency shelter, involving conversion andrehab costs that do not exceed 75 percent of the value of the buildingbefore conversion, should be treated as a conversion or a renovation. Thecommenter noted that the clarification is important since it determineswhether, under andSection; 576.73, the facility must be used as a homelessshelter for a 3- or 10-year period.The Department agrees with this comment, and has clarified the definitionsof ``conversion'' and ``rehabilitation'' by providing that if a changein the use of a building to an emergency shelter involves costs not inexcess of 75 percent of the value of the building before conversion, itwould be considered rehabilitation. In such event, the three year use requirementunder andSection; 576.73 would apply.Boston also questioned why the definition of ``emergency shelter'' (andSection;576.3) includes a requirement that such facilities provide overnight sleepingaccommodations. By doing so, the definition makes ineligible those facilitiesthat provide temporary shelter only during the day, or that provide supportiveservices without providing shelter.HUD agrees that the definition of ``emergency shelter'' is too restrictive,and the phrase ``with overnight sleeping accommodations'' is removed inthis final rule. Emergency shelter is now defined to mean ``any facility,the primary purpose of which is to provide temporary or transitional shelterfor the homeless in general or for specific populations of the homeless.''As a result, day centers and drop-in centers are eligible to receive fundsfor all ESG eligible activities. Boston also asked that the definition of ``obligated'' be modified to includea letter of award from a unit of local government to a nonprofit recipient,because of difficulties in negotiating and executing loan agreements forthe obligation of grant funds within the 180-day deadline. HUD has madethe requested change, and the definition of ``obligated'' now includesgrant amounts that a unit a general local government or State awards toa provide nonprofit organization by a letter of award, so long as the letterof award requires payment from the grant amount. Boston also commented that the requirement under andSection; 576.55 thatformula cities and counties spend all funds for budgeted activities withinone year of the date of the grant award is unrealistic and should be removed.In particular, Boston claimed that the requirement is unrealistic for projectsthat involve assistance for eligible activities under andSection; 576.21(a)(2) or (3), since funds awarded for operating costs or essential servicescannot begin to be spent until rehabilitation efforts are completed. Initially, it should be noted that the comment reflects a possible misunderstandingabout when the one-year standard applies. Under the existing ESG regulations,the one-year expenditure requirement applies only when a formula city,county, or State uses the ESG funds itself to undertake homeless activities.It does not apply when the formula city, county, or State allocates itsESG funds to a third party. Nevertheless, HUD agrees with Boston's comment that the one-year expenditurerequirement is too strict, and has decided instead to apply a single expenditurestandard, regardless of whether ESG funds are spent directly by a formulacity or county, a State, or by a third party. The new standard requiresthat State recipients spend all of the State funds within 24 months ofthe date that the State makes available all of its grant funds to its recipients.(See andSection; 576.55(a)(2)(ii).) For formula cities and counties, andterritories, all of the grant funds must be spent within 24 months of thegrant award by HUD. (See andSection; 576.55(b)(2).) II. Implementation of the 1988 McKinney Act In addition to the changes noted above, the Department is also codifyingin 24 CFR part 576 the amendments contained in the Stewart B. McKinneyHomeless Assistance Amendments Act, as published in the January 9, 1989ESG Notice (54 FR 750). These changes are discussed below. <ITAG tagnum="81">(A) Distribution of Assistance by States to Private Nonprofit Organizations</ITAG>Section 413 of the 1987 McKinney Act required States to distribute allof their grant amounts to units of general local government. Section 421of the 1988 McKinney Act amended section 413 to permit States also to distributefunds to private nonprofit organizations, if the relevant unit of generallocal government certifies that it approves the project. Several sectionsof the final rule have been amended to reflect this change, including andSection;576.3 (definitions of ``nonprofit recipient'', ``obligated'', and ``Staterecipients''); and andSection; 576.51(b)(2)(iii) (application). <ITAG tagnum="81">(B) Essential Services </ITAG>Section 422(a)(1) of the 1988 McKinney Act increased the limitation onessential services from 15 to 20 percent. This amendment is reflected atandSection; 576.21(b) (1) and (2) of the final rule. HUD has construed section422(a)(1) as also permitting the Department to apply its waiver authorityto the 20 percent limitation (see andSection; 576.21(c)). In calculating the 20 percent limitation on essential services, HUD isrequired to include homeless prevention activities under andSection; 576.21(a)(4).Similarly, homeless prevention activities are treated as essential servicesfor purposes of qualifying for a waiver of the 20 percent limitation. With regard to grants made to States, section 422(a)(2) of the 1988 McKinneyAct provides that the 20 percent limitation is to be measured against ``theaggregate amount of all (ESG) assistance to a State or a local government.''Grant amounts that the State distributes to individual State recipientsare not subject to the percentage limit. Thus, States are free to varythe percentage of ESG grant amounts that State recipients may use for essentialservices above or below the 20 percent standard. However, each State mustadminister its grant so that, on an aggregate basis, the amount expendedon essential services does not exceed the applicable limit. (See andSection;576.21(b)(2).) For ESG formula cities and counties, as well as units of local governmentreceiving reallocated funds from HUD, the 20 percent limitation on essentialservices continues to apply at the local level. In accordance with existingrequirements at andSection; 576.21(b)(1) of this final rule, the limitationwill apply to the total of each grant amount provided by HUD to these entities.<ITAG tagnum="81">(C) Homeless Prevention </ITAG>Section 423 of the 1988 McKinney Act added a new category of eligible activitiesunder the ESG program: homeless prevention. Section 576.3 provides a definitionof ``homeless prevention,'' and the applicable regulatory standards arelocated at andSection; 576.21(a)(4) of the final rule. In addition, it should be noted that HUD is applying a different obligationand expenditure standard for homeless prevention activities funded by States.Because it is difficult for States to ascertain local homeless preventionneeds within the current 65-day deadline, HUD is permitting States to setaside up to 10 percent of their grant funds for homeless prevention efforts.These set-aside funds must be made available to State recipients within180 days of the grant award by HUD. Thereafter, State recipients have 30days to obligate, and 180 days to spend, the funds for homeless preventionactivities. This language appears at andSection; 576.65 of the final rule.<ITAG tagnum="81"> (D) Required Use of Building as a Shelter </ITAG>Section 415(c)(1) of the 1987 McKinney Act requires each ESG recipientto certify to HUD that it will maintain as a homeless shelter, for a statutorilyrequired time period, any building for which ESG assistance is used. Undersection 424 of the 1988 McKinney Act, this statutory ``use'' requirementcontinues to be 10 years in the case of ESG activities involving majorrehabilitation or conversion. Similarly, the use requirement for rehabilitationactivities (other than major rehabilitation or conversion) remains unchangedat three years. However, the use requirements for activities conducted under sections 414(a)(2) and (3) of the 1988 McKinney Act_essential services and maintenanceand operating costs, respectively_have been legislatively revised:<ITAG tagnum="15">_Section 424 of the 1988 McKinney Act now specifies that an ESG recipientusing program funds to provide essential services, or maintenance and operatingcosts (including the leasing of commercial facilities), must carry outthe assisted activities ``for the period during which (ESG) assistanceis provided.'' (See andSection; 576.21(a)(2) and (a)(3), and andSection; 576.73(a)(2)(i).)The Act further provides that recipients may use a different site or shelterduring this period, so long as the same general population is served.</ITAG>In implementing this statutory standard, the Department interprets theterm ``same general population'' to mean the types of homeless personsoriginally served with the ESG assistance (such as specific categoriesof the homeless, including battered spouses, runaway children, families,or chronically mentally ill individuals), or persons in the same geographicarea. (See andSection; 576.73(a)(2)(ii).)<ITAG tagnum="15">_Using ESG funds for homeless prevention activities under andSection;576.21(a)(4) does not trigger any period of use requirements.</ITAG>The Department intends to apply these use requirements to both currentand prospective grantees. <ITAG tagnum="81">(E) Environmental Review </ITAG>Section 482 of the 1988 McKinney Act revised the environmental review proceduresfor assistance and projects under Title IV of the McKinney Act by makingapplicable the provisions of, and regulations and procedures under, section104(g) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (HCD Act of1974). Section 104(g)(1) authorizes HUD to provide for the release of funds forparticular projects to ``recipients of assistance'' under Title I of theHCD Act of 1974 that assume all of HUD's responsibilities for environmentalreview, decisionmaking, and action under the National Environmental PolicyAct of 1969 and certain other environmental authorities. Section 104(g)(2) contains the requirements for HUD approval of the releaseof funds for specific projects. Section 104(g)(4) provides that in the case of grants to a State in theStates program, the State will perform HUD's role with respect to the releaseof funds to particular projects to be undertaken by units of general localgovernment receiving grant amounts from the State. HUD regulations implementing section 104(g) are found in 24 CFR part 58.Aside from the NEPA requirements, the additional environmental authoritieswith which recipient States and units of local government under the HCDAct of 1974 must comply are listed at 24 CFR 58.5. In applying the regulations and procedures under section 104(g) to theMcKinney Act, the Department is providing for the assumption of environmentalreview responsibilities only by States, Territories and units of generallocal government. (See andSection; 576.52.) The Department will perform therequired environmental review for nonprofit organizations that receivereallocated funds from HUD in accordance with 24 CFR part 50 and andSection;576.53(c)(3), and for any governmental entities with general purpose powersfound not to have the legal capacity to carry out this reponsibility. Wheregovernmental entities assume the environmental review, these responsibilitieswill be carried out as follows:<ITAG tagnum="15">_Applicants that are States, Territories, formula cities and counties,or other governmental entities with general purpose powers, and that aredeemed to have the legal capacity to do so, must assume responsibilityfor environmental review, decisionmaking, and action for each applicationfor assistance in accordance with part 58. Specifically, States, Territories,or units of general local government must complete the environmental reviewfor each application for assistance, as follows: </ITAG>(1) In the case of ESG grants to States that are distributed to units ofgeneral local government, the unit of general local government must assumethe environmental responsibilities specified in section 104(g)(1) of theHousing and Community Development Act of 1974 and the State will assumeHUD's functions with regard to the release of funds, as provided by section104(g)(4) of that Act. (2) In the case of ESG grants to States that are distributed to nonprofitorganizations, the State will assume the environmental responsibilitiesspecified in section 104(g)(1) of that Act and HUD will perform the releaseof funds functions of section 104(g)(2). (3) In the case of ESG grants to a unit of general local government orTerritory, whether used directly by the grantee or distributed to nonprofitorganizations, the unit of general local government or Territory will assumethe environmental responsibilities specified in section 104(g)(1) of thatAct and HUD will perform the release of funds functions of section 104(g)(2).III. Other Changes 1. The definitions at andSection; 576.3 of ``conversion'', ``major rehabilitation'',``rehabilitation'', and ``renovation'' have been amended to require compliancewith local government safety and sanitation standards. (This requirementalso remains codified at andSection; 576.75.) These definitions have alsobeen amended to require that all buildings of 15 or more units that arerehabilitated meet the accessibility requirements of section 504 of theRehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, as provided in 24 CFR 8.23(a) or(b). In addition, the definition of ``rehabilitation'' is amended to includestructural changes necessary to make the structure accessible to personswith physical handicaps.2. A definition of ``essential services'' is included at andSection; 576.3of the rule. The definition incorporates the same activities that werelisted in the ESG final rule, as well as related activities.3. The definition of ``operation'' at andSection; 576.21(a)(3) is amendedto include the costs of administration (excluding staffing costs), repair,security, fuel, and equipment. These provisions are included under theMcKinney Act's definition of ``operating costs,'' and are not intendedto substantively affect the types of activities funded under this category.4. HUD has revised the criteria for obtaining a waiver of the 20 percentlimitation on essential services by strictly adhering to the McKinney waiverstandard. Under this final rule, HUD may waive the 20 percent limitationon essential services if the State or unit of local government demonstratesthat program activities other than essential services and homeless prevention(i.e. maintenance and operating costs, renovation, rehabilitation and conversionactivities) are already being carried out in the locality with other resources.(See andSection; 576.21(c).)5. Section 576.22 ``Limitations on the use of assistance'' has been addedin this final rule.However, this section largely duplicates requirementscontained in other sections of the August 10, 1988 ESG final rule, includingthe requirements governing assistance to primarily religious organizations.While all of the provisions relating to assistance to primarily religiousorganizations were not specifically included in the ESG final rule, theyhave routinely been incorporated in the grant agreements executed withHUD.It should be noted that paragraph (b) of andSection; 576.22, which describesthe limitations on the use of assistance by primarily religious organizations,contains provisions governing the circumstances under which HUD will provideassistance to a grantee or recipient that is a primarily religious organizationor a wholly secular organization established by a primarily religious organization.With one exception noted below, these provisions are substantially identicalto those set out in 24 CFR part 570, which consist of HUD's community developmentblock grant program (CDBG) entitlement rules.Under these provisions, a primarily religious organization (or wholly secularorganization established by a primarily religious organization) must agreeto provide housing and emergency services in a manner that is free fromreligious influence. In this connection, the provider must: (1) Not discriminateagainst any employee or applicant for employment on the basis of religionand not limit employment or give employment preference to persons on thebasis of religion; (2) not discriminate against, or limit the provisionof housing or emergency services, to applicants for such housing or serviceson the basis of religion; and (3) provide no religious instruction or counseling,conduct no religious worship or services, engage in no religious proselytizing,or otherwise exert no religious influence in the provision of housing oremergency services.As noted, the foregoing principles depart in one fashion from the CDBGentitlement rule at 24 CFR 570.200(j)(3) (53 FR 34416, 34412, September6, 1988), which contains an additional restriction that the portion ofthe facility of the primarily religious organization used to provide fundedservices ``shall contain no religious symbols or decorations, other thanthose permanently affixed to or part of the structure.''This policy has been followed for several years in connection with CDBGand homeless assistance made available through primarily religious organizationproviders. The Department has a continuing commitment to optimize participationby religious providers, which have long been in the forefront in assistingthe homeless and others most needy, but in a manner consistent with thestrictures imposed by the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment ofthe United States Constitution. After a review of the relevant case law,the Department has not found any dispositive case addressing the provisionof government assistance to a primarily religious organization providingsocial services in a setting where the presence of religious symbols ordecorations alone constitutes a violation of the Establishment Clause.The provision in question, which was recommended to HUD by counsel representinga nationally prominent primarily religious organization as a protectionagainst impermissibly advancing religion, has been utilized in the spiritin which it was so recommended. However, as noted, HUD's examination ofthe case law has concluded that the excised language suggests a degreeof control on the presence of religious symbols or decorations that isnot compelled thereunder, or is not otherwise intrinsic to traditionalConstitutional Church/State separation doctrine as pronounced by the UnitedStates Supreme Court. Accordingly, this rule does not include the prohibitionon religious symbols or decorations. Further, an amendment removing thequoted text from andSection; 570.200(j)(3)(iv) is being published as a finalrule in a separate document.This change in no way contravenes the purpose of the underlying principlesin these rules, namely, that a primarily religious organization, or a whollysecular organization established by a primarily religious organization,can only provide housing and emergency services in a manner that is freefrom religious influence, specifically including the explicit provisionsdescribed above.6. Section 576.51(d) (``Substantial change in proposed use of funds'')has been revised to require that the certification of consistency withthe Comprehensive Homeless Assistance Plan (CHAP) be accompanied by a descriptionof the revised proposed use of funds.7. The reallocation provision for failure to have an approved CHAP hasbeen streamlined by combining the requirements for both Territories andStates into one section (andSection; 576.63). As a result, the separate reallocationprovision for Territories at andSection; 576.65 has been removed.8. Section 576.80 (``Relocation'') has been added to implement the requirementsof the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition PoliciesAct of 1970 (42 U.S.C. 4601-4655).IV. Other MattersA Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment hasbeen made in accordance with HUD regulations in 24 CFR part 50, which implementsection 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 42U.S.C. 4332. The Finding of No Significant Impact is available for publicinspection between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays in the Office of theGeneral Counsel, Rules Docket Clerk, at the above address.This rule does not constitute a ``major rule'' as that term is definedin section 1(b) of the Executive Order on Federal Regulations issued bythe President on February 17, 1981. Analysis of the rule indicates thatit would not: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 millionor more; (2) cause a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individualindustries, Federal, State or local government agencies, or geographicregions; or (3) have a significant adverse effect on competition, employment,investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-basedenterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or exportmarkets.This rule was listed as item number 1087 in the Department's SemiannualAgenda of Regulations published on October 30, 1989 (54 FR 44702, 44728)under Executive Order 12291 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act.In accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the undersigned herebycertifies that this rule would not have a significant economic impact ona substantial number of small entities, because most statutorily eligiblegrantees and State recipients are relatively larger cities, urban counties,or States. In addition, the grant amounts to be made available to any ultimateuser of a grant are relatively small.The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606,the Family, has determined that certain provisions of this final rule mayhave the potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenanceand general well-being within the meaning of the Order. The final ruleauthorizes HUD to make grants to States, units of general local governmentand private nonprofit organizations for the rehabilitation or conversionof buildings for use as emergency shelter for the homeless, for the paymentof certain operating expenses, and for the newly eligible homeless preventionactivities. To the extent that ESG funds are used to undertake homelessprevention activities, they will help to sustain the family as a cohesiveunit by preventing displacement. While provisions of this final rule mightpotentially have an impact on the family, these are legislatively prescribedand HUD has exercised little or no discretion in implementing them.The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of ExecutiveOrder 12612, Federalism, has determined that some of the provisions ofthis final rule implementing the 1988 McKinney Amendments have ``Federalismimplications'' within the meaning of the Order. These include: (1) PermittingStates to provide ESG funds directly to a nonprofit organization, ratherthan requiring that the funds be provided to a unit of local governmentfor distribution to the nonprofit; and (2) in the case of States, applyingthe 20 percent limitation on essential services at the State, rather thanat the local, level. However, these provisions do not need to be consideredfurther under the Executive Order because they implement statutory requirementsover which HUD has exercised little or no discretion. Additionally, section482 of the 1988 Amendments Act provides that HUD shall apply the provisionsof, and regulations and procedures under, section 104(g) of the Housingand Community Development Act of 1974 to assistance and projects underTitle IV of the McKinney Act. Section 104(g) provides that the Secretarymay require applicants with the legal capacity to do so to assume the responsibilitiesfor environmental review, decisionmaking and action under the NationalEnvironmental Policy Act of 1969 and the other provisions of law specifiedby the Secretary that would apply to HUD were HUD to undertake such projectsas Federal projects.

Incases where proposed assistance and matching contributions solely involveoperating costs for facilities or the provision of essential services,and the structures and sites involved in the project meet the program requirementsof this part, these activities are categorically excluded by regulationand may be determined fully exempt from environmental review.(b) <T3>Responsibility for review.</T3> (1) HUD will perform the environmentalreview, in accordance with part 50, for applications submitted by privatenonprofit organizations for reallocated funds, and any governmental entitieswith general purpose powers found not to have the legal capacity to carryout this responsibility.(2) Applicants that are States, Territories, formula cities and counties,or other governmental entities with general purpose powers, and that aredeemed to have the legal capacity to do so, must assume responsibilityfor environmental review, decisionmaking, and action for each applicationfor assistance in accordance with part 58. Specifically, States, Territoriesor units of general local government must complete the environmental reviewfor each application for assistance, as follows:(A) In the case of ESG grants to States that are distributed to units ofgeneral local government, the unit of general local government must assumethe environmental responsibilities specified in section 104(g)(1) of theHousing and Community Development Act of 1974, and the State will assumeHUD's functions with regard to the release of funds, as provided by section104(g)(4) of that Act.(B) In the case of ESG grants to States that are distributed to nonprofitorganizations, the State will assume the environmental responsibilitiesspecified in section 104(g)(1) of that Act and HUD will perform the releaseof funds functions of section 104(g)(2).(C) In the case of ESG grants to a unit of general local government orTerritory, whether used directly by the grantee or distributed to nonprofitorganizations, the unit of general local government or Territory will assumethe environmental responsibilities specified in section 104(g)(1) of thatAct and HUD will perform the release of funds functions of section 104(g)(2).(3) The assumption of legal responsibility by an applicant under paragraph(b)(2) of this section does not preclude the applicant's arranging forthe conduct of technical reviews by cooperating local governments havingan established technical capability (e.g., by a metropolitan city in whichthe project is proposed to be located). The applicant under such arrangementmust independently evaluate information submitted and assume responsibilityfor its accuracy, scope and content; meet legal requirements attached tothe Release of Funds by HUD; determine the completeness of the review;meet any requirements for consultation, as applicable, under 24 CFR 58.5authorities; and assure the completion of any mitigation measures resultingfrom technical review or from State consultations.
