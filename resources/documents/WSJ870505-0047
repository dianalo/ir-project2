In an interest-rate swap, issuers of fixed-income securities trade interest payments. For instance, an issuer of fixed-rate debt could agree to make floating-rate payments to another institution that would make fixed-rate payments in return. Swaps allow participants to change the characteristics of their interest payments without affecting the underlying debt.    Almost $190 billion of new swaps was arranged last year and the total volume of swaps outstanding at the end of 1985 was $170 billion, the association reported. Interest-rate swap volume is expressed in terms of &quot;notional principal,&quot; or the amount of principal presumed to underly the swap, rather than the actual payments owed under the swap contract.    About half the participants in interest swaps are non-U.S. institutions. Financial institutions accounted for 60% of the volume, with corporations accounting for 29% and governments and international agencies accounting for 11%, the report said.    The association's results don't include currency swaps, in which not only the interest rate but the currency in which payments are made is swapped. Such transactions make up a sizable portion of the swap market.    The association's survey was conducted by Touche Ross Financial Services Center and included 36 major swap dealers world-wide. </TEXT></DOC>
