But demonstrations fizzled in Sweden and India for lack ofinterest, and a rally in West Germany attracted less than 100people, officials said.   In New York City, about 1,000 demonstrators rallied at Exxon'smidtown headquarters, then marched to the United Nations.Organizers estimated the crowd swelled to more than 5,000 people bythe end of the march, but police put the number at 2,500.   The Exxon tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground near Valdez, Alaska,on March 24, spilling 10.1 million gallons of crude oil intowildlife-rich Prince William Sound in the worst such spill inAmerican history.   In a speech to demonstrators, activist Jeremy Rifkin saidenvironmental politics had changed dramatically since the firstEarth Day in 1970.   ``All of our previous environmental crises have been regional innature. Now we are experiencing for the first time a globalenvironmental crisis,'' Rifkin said. ``The greenhouse effect,global warming, ozone depletion, acid rain and species extinctionnow threaten the entire planet and all the inhabitants that live init.   ``This is the first international Earth Day,'' he said, claimingit was the first time demonstrations were coordinated around theworld.   In Rome, about 1,000 people and 40 environmentalists cheered as20 protesters dressed in cardboard costumes resembling aerosol cansand refrigerators ran up the Spanish Steps and smashed through apaper hoop symbolizing the Earth's ozone layer.   The demonstration was intended to re-enact the creation of holesin the ozone layer by chlorofluorocarbons, which are chemicals usedin aerosol propellants and refrigerators.   Ozone occurs naturally in the Earth's stratosphere and screensout harmful ultraviolet light from the sun. Studies have shown thatchlorofluorocarbons are breaking down the protective barrier.   In Budapest's Vorosmarty Square, several hundred people turnedout for a demonstration sponsored by the Radical Party.Demonstrators included Ilona ``Cicciolina'' Staller, aHungarian-born porn actress and a Radical Party member of Italy'sparliament, and Nobel Prize-winning biophysicist Maurice H. F.Wilkins of Britain.   Near Wichita, Kan., about 750 people gathered outside chemicalplants owned by Racon Inc. and Vulcan Chemicals to demand they stopusing chlorofluorocarbons within a year.   According to environmentalists, Racon is one of five U.S.companies that produce the chemicals and Vulcan is major supplierto those businesses.   Spokesmen for the two companies said a ban onchlorofluorocarbons is not realistic because reliable alternativeshave not been found, and that the chemical industry is spendingbillions of dollars trying to find other substances.   In Frankfurt, West Germany, only about 60 people turned out fora demonstration at the Hoechst chemical company, police said.   ``The weather was pretty rainy, and that might have hadsomething to do with it,'' said police spokesman Wolfgang Nebelung.   About 500 people rallied at a park in San Jose, Calif., andmarched to an IBM plant where they tied green and white ribbons ona gate to protest the use of chlorofluorocarbons in the electronicsindustry.   ``In this beautiful setting we are dealing with a problem thatin 20 years could be deadly. In 20 years, it may not be safe forpeople to lie in the sun,'' consumer advocate Ralph Nader said atthe rally.   More than 1,000 people learned how to make non-toxic householdcleaners and received other environmental tips at an exposition atMichigan State University in East Lansing.   About 200 people gathered in Chicago for an Earth Day observancethat resembled a picnic more than a protest.   Speakers, however, criticized Exxon for its part in the oilspill. ``This would not be a safe place for a person from Exxon,''said Bob Rudner of Greenpeace.   Bill Harding showed up in a bathrobe made of common lawn grass,and hawked grow-your-own starter kits for $25 each.   ``It makes me feel closer to the Earth,'' Harding said. ``It'slike you have your own portable environment.''   In Harrisburg, Pa., Gov. Robert Casey marked Earth Day byannouncing more than $600,000 in grants for cleaning up theSusquehanna River Valley.   Environmentalists at the University of Colorado in Bouldercelebrated Earth Day on Friday with a Festival of the Earthfeatured a recycling Olympics in which competitors stomped aluminumcans and rolled trash bins in relay races.   The first Earth Day celebration was held in April 1970.</TEXT></DOC>
