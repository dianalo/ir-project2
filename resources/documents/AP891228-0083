(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Fourteen mothers who were once onwelfare have found jobs doing what they know best _ being moms.   The women have been taken off government assistance and receive$21,000 annual salaries for being foster mothers to disabledchildren under a state program called LIFE, or Living in FamilyEnvironments.   ``These women are capable of doing something, but for the mostpart they're best at being moms, and they're happy being moms,''said state Rep. Shirley Johnson, who helped win funding for theprogram.   ``I was scared to death at the beginning _ how would you matchthe right mom with the right child? But it has worked beautifully.''   The 3-year-old program, which operates primarily on a $200,000grant from the state Department of Mental Health, was the idea ofMounir Sharobeem, president of the Judson Center in Royal Oak, aDetroit suburb. The center helps abused and neglected children anddisabled adults.   ``Instead of stereotyping welfare recipients as lazy, let'strain the families, let them select a developmentally disabledchild and use their time and energy more effectively,'' Sharobeemsaid.   ``People said we would be endangering handicapped children byputting them with welfare families. But these families have beendoing a great job with them, and it's not easy.''   Sharobeem said one disabled child in an institution costs theMental Health Department $45,000 a year. A welfare family of fourcosts the Department of Social Services $16,000 a year.   The children are also given more personal care inside a home,even though most of the mothers are single parents, Sharobeem said.   The mothers are screened and licensed by the Judson Center andreceive training in caring for disabled children, said DianeDevine-Abdullah, LIFE director.   ``They go through a seven-day, 28-hour training, then 20 hourshome training in a current foster home,'' Devine-Abdullah said.``We have four more families ready and waiting for placement.''   The mothers are then matched with children from Michiganinstitutions. The average age of most of the children is between 15and 16, Devine-Abdullah said.   DSS Director C. Patrick Babcock said the state is looking toexpand the program. But Johnson said budget constraints won't allowa full-scale program.   One mother, Darlene Gisel of Warren, cares for 11-month-oldWilliam, who was born with tuberculosis of the brain. The conditionwas stabilized but could result in a learning disability orretardation.   ``He was in the hospital six months before I took him,'' Giselsaid. ``He didn't respond at all. He's gotten farther than theyever thought he would.   ``There's a lot of joy in watching them grow. These are kids whoprobably wouldn't have had a chance in life.''   Gisel said her mother also was a foster mom and worked withhandicapped children.   ``I knew I wanted to deal with handicapped kids,'' she said.``They need a little more of a chance. I think we can show thatthey can learn and they can live a normal life with a disability.''   Mothers in the LIFE program also find that the salary allowsthem to provide more for their own children.   Bertha Crawford is foster mother to Dorothy, 17, who can't dressherself and can't talk. Crawford also has two high-school-agechildren of her own.   ``I feel good about helping someone else,'' Crawford said. ``Italso gave me the chance to send my daughter on her senior trip. Icouldn't have afforded it without the program.''</TEXT></DOC>
