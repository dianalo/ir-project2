LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The federal government, not state governors, hasthe final authority over the deployment of National Guard troopsoutside the United States, an appeals court ruled Wednesday.   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld an amendment thatprohibits governors from withholding consent to send troops outsidethe country because of objections to the location, purpose, type orschedule of active duty.   ``We hold that the Constitution does not require gubernatorialconsent to active duty for training of the National Guard of theUnited States,'' the court said in its 7-2 opinion.   The original lawsuit was filed on behalf of Minnesota Gov. RudyPerpich by Hubert H. Humphrey III, the state's attorney general.Minnesota was joined in the suit by the states of Colorado,Delaware, Maine, Massachusetts, Ohio and Vermont.   Opposing them was the Defense Department, which was joined asfriends of the court by the National Guard Association of the UnitedStates and the states of Alabama, Georgia, Hawaii, Iowa, Kentucky,Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi and Missouri.   In 1985 and 1986, several governors objected to deployment ofNational Guard personnel to Central America. The governors withheldor threatened to withhold their consent to federally ordered activeduty missions by their states' National Guard units.   In response, Congress enacted the Montgomery Amendment, whichprohibits the governors from withholding consent.   After members of the Minnesota National Guard participated inthree active duty training missions in Honduras in January 1987,Perpich filed suit seeking a declaration of the governors'constitutional authority.   Perpich asked specifically for a declaration that the MontgomeryAmendment infringed on the states' right under the Constitution totrain the militia. The lawsuit sought to enjoin any federal ordercommanding members of the Minnesota unit of the National Guard toactive duty for training outside the country without Perpich'sconsent.   A U.S. District Court ruled against Perpich, saying the dualenlistment system, under which Guard members enlist and serve inboth the state National Guard and the federal National Guard, was aproper exercise of Congress' power to raise and support armies.   A three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appealsreversed that ruling, however, holding that the Montgomery Amendmentviolated the constitutional authority of states to train its militia.   That ruling said the National Guard could not be ordered toactive duty for training without the consent of the states unlessCongress or the president first declared a national securityemergency.   The federal government appealed and was granted a rehearing onthe issue by the full appeals court.   Senior Circuit Judge Gerald W. Heaney strongly disagreed withWednesday's ruling.   ``With a few strokes of the word processor,'' Heaney said in hisdissent, ``the majority has written the Militia Clause out of theUnited States Constitution.   ``In so doing, it contradicts the clear intent of the foundingfathers, who believed that state control over elements of themilitary was essential to a free and peaceful republic.''</TEXT></DOC>
