The three unions called the strike to press wage demands installed contract negotiations.   A Tel Aviv labor court ordered the workers back to work, andunion leaders said they would comply at the end of the job actionscheduled for midnight Thursday.   President Chaim Herzog said the strikers were ``fightingprofessional struggles on the public's back, on the back of thecitizens.''   ``I rise up against this norm, which has become entrenched inIsrael,'' Herzog said on Israel's army radio, the only radiostation operating Thursday.   The strikers also shut down the government-run televisionstation. The Bezek telephone company did not make repairs, and theelectric company operated on a reduced weekend schedule, accordingto the radio report.   The strike virtually paralyzed the government-run aviationindustry, military factories, high technology industries and someplants owned by the Histadrut, Israel's trade union federation, theradio said.   At Ben Gurion International Airport near Tel Aviv, somedisruptions, including flight delays, were reported.   ``The automatic luggage distributor has failed, and of coursethe technicians are not repairing it,'' union leader MosheBen-David told the radio.   At Tel Aviv University, about 500 engineers and administrationofficials did not show up for work, shutting down laboratories andcomputers, said university spokeswoman Carole Cook. Jerry Barach, aspokesman for Jerusalem's Hebrew University, reported a similarsituation.   Yitzhak Raz, head of the technicians union, said the strike wasa warning to the Finance Ministry to renew stalled wagenegotiations.   Finance Minister Moshe Nissim, who has maintained strict priceand wage controls to keep Israel's high inflation in check,responded by saying the strike did not damage to the economy.   ``This is a one-day strike that was forced on the workers by theprofessional unions, and I heard that many workers weredissatisfied (with the strike call),'' he said.   The strike came just after negotiations passed a major hurdle,when unions agreed to end the linkage between wages and economicindicators, said ministry spokesman Yitzhak Feinberg.   Such linkages in the past have been blamed as contributing tohigh inflation rates.   The unions represent workers in variety of workplaces and salarylevels. They have not stated specific figures, but they want raisesof at least 10 percent. Monthly salaries now range from $435 to$1,850.   The government maintains the economy now is stable so even smallraises are unnecessary. Inflation last year was 20 percent, whichis low by Israeli standards.</TEXT></DOC>
