The party leadership tendered the proposal published in itsnewspaper, Pravda, as its solution to the ethnic conflicts thatthreaten to rip apart the Soviet Union. More than 200 people havedied in ethnic strife in the past 18 months, and groups in severalof the 15 republics are calling for secession.   In its proposals, the party offers no specific solutions to stemthe ethnic hatred that has led to clashes involving Armenians,Azerbaijanis, Abkhazians, Georgians, Turks, Uzbeks and others. Someactivists welcomed the party's attempt to compromise, but said vaguepromises of decentralization are no longer enough to solve ``thenationalities question.''   ``The only solution is for the republics to be absolutely free,''said Nodar Notadze, head of the People's Front in Georgia.   The draft policy also calls for a law banning ``nationalist andchauvinist'' organizations, which could be used against groupsdemanding independence from Moscow.   The greatest concession offers the republics the power toquestion national laws before a strengthened high court.   That clause appeared to be aimed at Estonia, Latvia andLithuania, which have amended their constitutions to proclaim theirright to reject national laws. The Kremlin previously said thisviolated the Soviet Constitution.   Thursday's document said that to achieve a transformation of theSoviet federation, ``the question has been raised of working out andsigning a new union agreement instead of the Treaty on the Formationof the U.S.S.R. of 1922.''   That could be limited to the party's suggestion of expandedpowers for republics. But it opens the possibility that radicalscould push through radical change such as Andrei D. Sakharov'ssuggested loose confederation of sovereign states, or even thebreakup of the union into independent states.   The 1922 treaty created the U.S.S.R. as a union of allegedlysovereign republics which were in reality dominated by the Kremlinin Moscow.   Estonian activists originally suggested rewriting the treaty ofunion in November, when they made world headlines by becoming thefirst of the Baltics to declare their republic ``sovereign'' withinthe framework of the Soviet Union.   By Thursday, however, Baltic activists were no longer excited bythe possibility.   ``We don't want a new agreement,'' said Aigar Irgens, an editorat Atmoda, the newspaper of the Latvian Popular Front. ``We wantcomplete independence.''   ``They are trying to present to the world that we in the SovietUnion now have a federation built on the will of the people,'' saidAlvydas Juozaitis of the Lithuanian popular front, Sajudis. That isimpossible as long as the Red Army ``occupies'' the republic, hesaid.   Sajudis, which swept parliamentary elections in Lithuania in thespring and openly advocates independence, is ``not prepared to signa new agreement with the Soviet Union until the Soviet Unionrenounces our occupation,'' Juozaitis said.   The draft, approved by the ruling party Politburo, is expected tobe discussed in the party central committees of the republics priorto the meeting of the 250-member national Central Committee nextmonth in Moscow.   The document indicates the party leadership still favors a strongcentral government, despite its willingness to transfer certainpowers to the republics.   For example, it says the republics ``can raise the question'' ofcanceling national laws they believe exceed the authority of thecentral government. But it claims for the Moscow-based governmentthe far stronger power to veto unconstitutional laws passed in therepublics.   The party suggests that such disputes be settled by theConstitutional Control Commission, a quasi-Supreme Court that wascreated last year.   The party's call for a new law banning ``nationalist andchauvinist organizations'' could be targeted at pro-secession groupssuch as the Party of National Independence in Georgia, Russianstrikers protesting a new language law in Estonia, or themass-membership Estonian Popular Front, which supported the languagelaw.   ``We have nationalist groups in Latvia, but the term is verybroad,'' Irgens said. The effect of the party's proposed ban, hesaid, would depend on the definition of nationalist.   The draft includes the promise to ``give to the republics allrights related to their status as sovereign socialist states,'' andsays they are empowered to solve problems except in those areaswhere they give control to the national government.   The Soviet Constitution is contradictory on this point, promisingsovereignty to the republics but simultaneously claiming thatnational law is superior. The proposed policy does not clear up someof that fuzziness.   It grants the republics' demand for the right to use anddistribute their land and natural resources. But it also reserves tothe national government the right to determine the ``all-unionbasis'' of how resources should be used.   The division of economic power is similarly vague.   In hopes of calming national conflicts, the document calls for anew law guaranteeing the rights of citizens living outside theirnational boundaries. It also calls for creation of a new governmententity to handle ethnic relations, and local councils forminorities, with the right to self-government.</TEXT></DOC>
